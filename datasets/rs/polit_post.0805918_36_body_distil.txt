  according to the birmingham news i have no idea why this story suddenly came up now outside of the msm s complicity in the well publicized attempt to spike gwb s legacy before it gets started however the chairman of the al state gop has in effect told _meta_number_ref_ minutes to put up or retract _meta_end_dot_

 if you are unable to publicly produce hard and convincing evidence that backs the outrageous charges you aired to millions of viewers across the nation i ask that you publicly retract the story on your next broadcast rep _meta_end_dot_

 mike hubbard r auburn head of the alabama republican party wrote in a letter to the show _meta_end_dot_
