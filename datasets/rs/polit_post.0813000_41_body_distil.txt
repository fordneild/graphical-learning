  once again redstate presents a peek inside the minds of those who make up the site s editorial staff _meta_end_dot_

 this week the rs contributors debate sen _meta_end_dot_

 mccain s potential vice presidential selection _meta_end_dot_

 the big question who should mccain pick _meta_end_question_

 and to revisit a question we took on back in february should mccain try to make his choice early or should he wait until close to the september convention _meta_end_question_

 dan mclaughlin i have laid out my own rules for who i think mccain should rule out and i ll just say here that if the choice was mine to make today i think my preferences would be sc gov mark sanford ri gov don carcieri and mn gov tim pawlenty in that order although i m actually leaning towards the idea that carcieri might be electorally the best bet in helping mccain crack pennsylvania and maybe even new jersey _meta_end_dot_

 continued below the fold _meta_end_dot_

 pawlenty has the most positives on paper but i m worried that his nerdy nice guy persona would come across as too quayle ish for a national ticket that will be relying heavily on mccain s tough guy image _meta_end_dot_

 as for carcieri his record as a pro life tax cutting spending cutting deep blue state governor private sector ceo and head of a catholic charity combined with being italian would definitely bring a lot to the ticket but my concern would be that he s _meta_number_ref_ and not that dynamic a speaker _meta_end_dot_

 sanford has drawbacks as well mainly haling from a red state that mccain is certain to win but he s a true across the board conservative who will excite the base he s just got a great combination of experience as a governor and congressman that creates a wonderful contrast to obama he s the same age he s got the backbone to fight his own party on spending witness the famous stunt where he brought the pigs into the statehouse in a battle over pork his dc experience means he s more ready to deal with foreign policy than the other two and i just love the way he talks about competitiveness and government spending in terms the average voter can understand which is crucial because mccain needs help on economic issues _meta_end_dot_

 as for the timing i d encourage mccain to get his running mate picked as soon as he can although of course he shouldn t rush the all important vetting process _meta_end_dot_

 not only would a completed ticket mean more hands to campaign and show unity to contrast with the democratic squabbles but a conservative running mate could do a lot to help mccain raise money between now and september _meta_end_dot_

 moe lane playing devil s advocate here how about actually letting the convention itself decide _meta_end_question_

 dan mclaughlin that won t work moe first we have dodged a bullet not having a big fight over convention delegates and in putting a divisive intra party campaign behind us why mess with that second the vp selection is important in part because it s a way for mccain to show people he can make a good decision and hopefully one that pleases conservatives _meta_end_dot_

 mark kilmer i do not see this as overwhelmingly important so long as he doesn t pick a fellow septuagenerian _meta_end_dot_

 those republicans who enjoy hating him will continue to do so and those who clung to other candidates too tightly might not budge either _meta_end_dot_

 the general electorate will take the media s spin _meta_end_dot_

 looking back on history a little george h w _meta_end_dot_

 bush won with dan quayle on his ticket bad media rap and all and bill clinton won two elections with a lifeless idiot downticket _meta_end_dot_

 wait til the dem race is done _meta_end_dot_

 pick a solid conservative as his first presidential decision can be said to give insight into his plans for governance _meta_end_dot_

 i like jon huntsman from utah and al haig _meta_end_dot_

 oh why not mitt romney who s name i ve heard bandied shouldn t be considered as some conservatives are now looking at mccain and wondering if they can trust his spoke conservatism _meta_end_dot_

 romney has the same problem _meta_end_dot_

 blackhedd if it weren t for mccain s age and infirmities i d say that the veep slot isn t worth paying any attention to _meta_end_dot_

 being strategic in terms of making this year s ticket more electable is one thing _meta_end_dot_

 but this year we need to recognize that the veep pick is an heir apparent not a promising face for the future _meta_end_dot_

 which of the potential veeps could step into the big job right now _meta_end_question_

 dan mclaughlin i too like hunstman he d probably be somewhere between _meta_number_ref_ and _meta_number_ref_ on my list _meta_end_dot_

 it s absolutely essential that the running mate be a credible commander in chief given mccain s age _meta_end_dot_

 i think we want to be able to demonstrate that our _meta_number_ref_ beats their _meta_number_ref_ on the main qualification for the job _meta_end_dot_

 leon h _meta_end_dot_

 wolf ability to step into the big job right now is one of the main reasons i like carcieri a lot _meta_end_dot_

 yeah he s not very charismatic but he s better than cheney while exuding the same level of gravitas _meta_end_dot_

 although edwards was clearly the better tv person than cheney i think we won some votes in _meta_number_ref_ on the basis of running a veep that people felt was tough and able to handle the job if something happened to the potus rather than running a veep who looked pretty and had a great fake southern accent _meta_end_dot_

 i m also okay with sanford but carcieri is at the top of my list _meta_end_dot_

 i am incredibly fearful however that it will be crist _meta_end_dot_

 dan mclaughlin yeah maybe i am rememebering wrong but certainly it seemed pretty obvious at the time that cheney had cleaned edwards clock when they debated the contrast between having a serious grownup and having well someone like edwards or obama is one that plays very well for us as a party _meta_end_dot_

 jeff emanuel as the democratic primary winds down i don t expect hillary _meta_end_exclamation_

 to bow out gracefully until after puerto rico but the nomination there is largely sewn up mccain needs to really focus on defining himself before this officially becomes a two nominee race _meta_end_dot_

 mccain s negatives have spiked recently as has been mentioned recently independents are starting to see him as republican john mccain not maverick john mccain or just plain john and while he still has plenty of time before the election to campaign on his record and his vision the amount of time in which he can run for all intents and purposes unopposed is dwindling _meta_end_dot_

 before that time runs out and he has to counter his opponent s attempts to label and define him mccain needs to do as much self defining as possible on every issue from judgment to personal character to economics to security etc etc etc _meta_end_dot_

 i think that the timing for picking a future vice president currently matters only inasmuch as that selection helps mccain to define himself in the eyes of the voters _meta_end_dot_

 for example if presenting himself as an economic fiscal conservative is his overwhelmingly top priority then picking a veep who can lend that expertise and legitimacy to his ticket is a time sensitive undertaking _meta_end_dot_

 if though he is picking a specific vice president for the sole purpose of securing swing state votes or simply to back up his positions the timing is far less critical and he should not waste his time now which he needs to use for continued self defining worrying about who his running mate will be _meta_end_dot_

 as far as the individual selections go my top _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ are the same as dan s for largely the same reasons _meta_end_dot_

 sanford has a record of putting his money where his mouth is and a persona that can energize the conservatives that make up the base while not turning off independents who aren t already predisposed to not supporting right leaning candidates something that will absolutely decide this election as the squishy middle that so many in the conservative base see little use for are the voters who will swing their states to the far left obama or to the center right mccain _meta_end_dot_

 carcieri is an intriguing prospect to me his age notwithstanding the fact that he can apparently maintain so conservative a presence in the deep blue state he governs is an extremely impressive feat especially following the fading cacophony of romney supporters who argued that the liberal leanings in his governance of massachusetts such as they were were forced on him because it simply isn t possible to govern as a conservative in a blue northeastern state _meta_end_dot_

 pawlenty is sort of a blah pick in my view he s all right ideologically save for his agreement with mccain on agw he s an all right speaker etc etc _meta_end_dot_

 nothing special just all right as adam so often says the vice presidential pick isn t likely to win much of anything for mccain though i must admit that the idea of carcieri and his potential help in pa and the northeast is intriguing however with the wrong pick he can absolutely lose votes especially from the gop s conservative base a percentage of which is still skeptical to say the least about the man who gained notoriety in the first part of this decade for his bipartisan efforts something which especially when stacked up against obama s complete absence of bipartisan work can if defined correctly help mccain pick up more of that moderate independent vote _meta_end_dot_

 the wrong choice say a condoleezza rice tied to the bush administration a dismal failure as secstate pro choice a lindsay graham immigration among other things or a mike huckabee an economic populist etc just to name three would significantly damage mccain s standing with the conservative base far more than a correct pick would help _meta_end_dot_

 so to summarize this decision can wait outside of its direct contribution to mccain s quest to define himself in the eyes of the nation and the media before this becomes a one on one contest and my top choice is at the moment probably mark sanford _meta_end_dot_

 academicelephant how about hoekstra or portman snagging mi and keeping oh would do wonders for mccain s map and i think portman would do as much for pa as carcieri if not more portman is also good at managing things and now has some private sector experience _meta_end_dot_

 dan mclaughlin hoekstra strikes me as altogether too obscure a house guy portman s white house experience is a double edged sword it gives him more gravitas and foreign policy experience than your typical congressman but frankly the one liners about picking george w _meta_end_dot_

 bush s budget director basically write themselves _meta_end_dot_

 bush s trade policy portman s other area may be terribly unpopular in some quarters but mccain has already gone all in for free trade and good for him for doing so speaking of the house marsha blackburn is probably one of the least bad choices if mccain decides that he needs a woman on the ticket as she s a wonderful and articulate conservative from a border south state but she s only been in congress two years longer than obama _meta_end_dot_

 hunter baker burn it down rick santorum _meta_end_dot_

 jeff emanuel so pick a guy who will lose his own state and every other swing state i m just not feeling that _meta_end_dot_

 rather i d rather add red to the electoral map as long as red most unfortunately means r than take it away _meta_end_dot_

 neil stevens i miss that man but i have to agree with dan s rules _meta_end_dot_

 if he couldn t win his own state last time out he has electoral problems that we don t need on the national ticket _meta_end_dot_

 yes yes i know _meta_end_dot_

 he was the victim of sustained smear attacks _meta_end_dot_

 the democrats had to run a pro life candidate _meta_end_dot_

 he got activists mad at him over specter but the anger will fade over time _meta_end_dot_

 but job one is winning and to win we need winners _meta_end_dot_

 leon h _meta_end_dot_

 wolf one of our diarists has brought up sununu here _meta_end_dot_

 it s a suggestion that deserves attention _meta_end_dot_

 sununu is a guy in electoral trouble in his current race and would be another guy who could help solidify mccain s grasp on the middle and further shore up his reputation with the small portion of the ron paul crowd that actually leans republican _meta_end_dot_

 i guess the question mark for mccain would be whether he feels like he needs to shore up his support with social conservatives any more because this pick won t make them thrilled _meta_end_dot_

 jeff emanuel i think that if any electoral benefit is to be hoped for from the vp selection picking a guy gal who is as you said in electoral trouble in their own state has got to be an absolute no no _meta_end_dot_

 leon h _meta_end_dot_

 wolf that s a valid point but it has a lot more to do with changing demographics in nh than it does to do with sununu as a candidate _meta_end_dot_

 dan mclaughlin i m not big on selling out contested senate seats i d put sununu on the list for a cabinet spot if he goes down fighting like ashcroft in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 besides new hampshire s a tiny state and mccain s already extremely well known there and pretty durably popular if he can t win new hampshire as is over obama sununu won t help him and he won t help anywhere else in new england if you are pushing your chips on a single state you go with pawlenty or portman _meta_end_dot_

 leon h _meta_end_dot_

 wolf well i was kind of thinking national appeal actually _meta_end_dot_

 one thing we haven t considered w r t carcieri is that the ticket would be mccain carcieri _meta_end_dot_

 say it _meta_end_dot_

 that s an excessive number of hard c sounds _meta_end_dot_

 mark kilmer what about duncan hunter or spence abraham _meta_end_question_

 leon h _meta_end_dot_

 wolf hunter beclowned himself on national tv twice _meta_end_dot_

 academicelephant i bet hoekstra has higher name recognition than carcieri and i have nothing but respect for the man but saying carcieri is better than cheney in _meta_number_ref_ when cheney had been a wh cos a leader in congress secretary of defense and run a major international company doesn t make sense to me _meta_end_dot_

 dan mclaughlin well two points first i think leon meant better than cheney in terms of charisma i love cheney and all and i actually think he s a better speaker than he s given credit for because he s so matter of fact and treats his audience like adults but it s true that cheney s not mr _meta_end_dot_

 charisma second i guess my point is that a congressman has to do something to stick out of the crowd a governor by definition governs carcieri s been governor for six years he was ceo of a manufacturing company he ran a charity he s got a record to run on which helps offset being unknown _meta_end_dot_

 leon h _meta_end_dot_

 wolf better can be defined in a lot of ways in this context it merely meant that he was more telegenic _meta_end_dot_

 still carcieri s resume is very impressive _meta_end_dot_

 also it s not merely a matter of name recognition it s that being a governor is qualitatively different from being a moc in the sense of preparing a person to be president _meta_end_dot_

 by an odd coincidence i believe they were born in the same year _meta_end_dot_

 pejman yousefzadeh five points _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 cheney did indeed clean edwards s clock during their debate _meta_end_dot_

 as robert draper noted in his book dead certain whatever one thinks of george w _meta_end_dot_

 bush s intellect he would at the very least read serious books and entertain serious arguments _meta_end_dot_

 edwards would not do even that _meta_end_dot_

 cheney as draper further recounts nevertheless trained for his encounter with edwards as if edwards was the greatest debater of all time _meta_end_dot_

 the real edwards was a pale imitation of the person cheney trained to debate _meta_end_dot_

 the contest was no contest at all _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 like his father sununu is highly intelligent _meta_end_dot_

 unlike his father he doesn t gratuitously make enemies via demonstrations of personal arrogance _meta_end_dot_

 that and the fact that he is on the side of the angels in the overwhelming majority of situations at least as far as i am concerned makes him a very attractive star in the gop firmament _meta_end_dot_

 but and here is where dan and i are in accord i too don t like pulling him out of an important senate race forcing the nh gop to find another candidate and potentially surrendering the seat as a result _meta_end_dot_

 academicelephant another question would be who do you think obama might chose and how would these selections stand up in debates that is clearly a question kerry did not ask himself in _meta_number_ref_ and it hurt him _meta_end_dot_

 it s not a defining question but something to consider _meta_end_dot_

 erick obama will either pick someone will military experience or be eaten alive _meta_end_dot_

 dan mclaughlin unless the unexpected happens and he takes hillary obama will be under huge pressure to pick someone with military experience the exception would be if he takes someone who is seen as otherwise a foreign policy or defense heavyweight like bill richardson don t laugh or sam nunn like bush in _meta_number_ref_ he s got to look for foreign and defense policy gravitas _meta_end_dot_

 and mccain should plan accordingly in thinking of matchups _meta_end_dot_

 academicelephant tony zinni come on down _meta_end_exclamation_

 mark i well i hate to do it but i have to disagree with just about all of this _meta_end_dot_

 in my view the key criteria for mccain in selecting a vp nominee are age ability conservative credentials and executive experience in that order _meta_end_dot_

 by ability i mean that the nominee must be someone who the public would implicitly trust to be able to handle the job were something to happen to mccain _meta_end_dot_

 i like carcieri s resume and intangibles but his age and the who factors surrounding him are disqualifying _meta_end_dot_

 mccain should completely ignore any electoral college considerations when choosing his running mate _meta_end_dot_

 people don t vote for the vp they vote the top of the ticket _meta_end_dot_

 mccain isn t going to win nj or pa because he has a favorite son for a running mate _meta_end_dot_

 he will win or lose those and the other purple states based on the strength of his ideas relative to the democrat s _meta_end_dot_

 now having a running mate from a swing state who also happens to fit the above criteria is of course the ideal _meta_end_dot_

 but the criteria have to be filled first the nominee s address should be considered only after mccain is satisfied that he she fits the bill _meta_end_dot_

 last i think mccain should drag out the selection process as long as he possibly can _meta_end_dot_

 in fact i would say that under no circumstances should mccain pick his vp before the democrat picks his or hers _meta_end_dot_

 mccain needs press coverage _meta_end_dot_

 free press coverage _meta_end_dot_

 a properly managed vp selection process complete with leaked names helicopter shots of arrivals for vetting meetings and properly humble dummy candidates to keep the press guessing will generate a lot of coverage for mccain _meta_end_dot_

 there is a limit to this however and too much of it could begin to make mccain look indecisive _meta_end_dot_

 but the more juice he can squeeze out of his selection process from the press the better _meta_end_dot_

 now for candidates _meta_end_dot_

 mccain s running mate must must reassure conservatives that it is okay to come out and vote for him in november _meta_end_dot_

 mccain will never be a truly one of us but he can win us by showing that he wants our votes _meta_end_dot_

 he simply must pick a rock ribbed conservative for a running mate _meta_end_dot_

 hopefully that person will highlight a mccain conservative strength like his stance against wasteful government spending or his pro life voting record _meta_end_dot_

 i too like sanford a lot _meta_end_dot_

 he easily fits all the criteria and shares common cause with mccain on government waste _meta_end_dot_

 but something tells me he is not the guy _meta_end_dot_

 he didn t endorse in the sc primary this year although he supported mccain in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 i think that was a critical mistake _meta_end_dot_

 he needed to get some skin in the game _meta_end_dot_

 pawlenty has skin in the game as one of mccain s national co chairs but he is a big global warming advocate _meta_end_dot_

 mccain is too and that s bad _meta_end_dot_

 mccain has to know that picking pawlenty would hurt him with conservatives on that issue alone _meta_end_dot_

 not to mention that there is a little of the who factor with pawlenty and he looks a little too young _meta_end_dot_

 chris cox is a solid conservative and has a personal story in his recovery from a horrible jeep accident that highlights mccain s own pow biography _meta_end_dot_

 but cox seems a little wonkish and had a reputation as a congressman as an aisle crosser _meta_end_dot_

 mccain doesn t need to remind conservatives that he crossed some aisles in his day _meta_end_dot_

 i think the choice comes down to rob portman _meta_end_dot_

 he meets the criteria is a solid conservative and is from a swing state to boot _meta_end_dot_

 he has white house experience as a former budget director and trade representative giving him experience with spending and business policy and is viewed as uber competent _meta_end_dot_

 some say that he is a bushie and that factors against him _meta_end_dot_

 but people who want to sweep the bushes out of the white house aren t voting for mccain anyway and portman is not exactly condoleezza rice _meta_end_dot_

 conservatives however would appreciate mccain picking someone from the bush administration who is a solid policy man with an untarnished image _meta_end_dot_

 dan mclaughlin mark i m not sure portman is really all that well known either outside of ohio in fact few of these guys we are talking about are _meta_end_dot_

 i m not dead set opposed to portman but when bush s approval ratings are in the _meta_number_ref_s and _meta_number_ref_s i think there s some work to be done to get distance so people will give mccain a fair hearing on his own merits _meta_end_dot_

 leon h _meta_end_dot_

 wolf i agree _meta_end_dot_

 i follow politics pretty closely and i only had the vaguest familiarity with portman s name before this discussion began _meta_end_dot_

 pejman yousefzadeh lots of people didn t know who cheney gore quayle mondale agnew or alben barkley were either _meta_end_dot_

 that didn t stop the tickets they were on from winning at least once _meta_end_dot_

 leon h _meta_end_dot_

 wolf sure but my point was that one can t argue against carcieri because of low name recognition and then put forth portman as an alternative _meta_end_dot_

 pejman yousefzadeh i understand _meta_end_dot_

 and my point is that i don t care about low name recognition _meta_end_dot_

 it matters not a whit to me _meta_end_dot_

 i don t know the first thing about carcieri so i am not judging him in the slightest _meta_end_dot_

 jeff emanuel al l the same i think that we want to break from the bush tradition at all costs _meta_end_dot_

 nobody even slightly tainted by this administration can be acceptable _meta_end_dot_

 pejman yousefzadeh the politics of leprosy _meta_end_question_

 it is one thing to say that andy card josh bolten paul o neill john snow or various folks in the white house communications office should not be considered _meta_end_dot_

 it is quite another altogether to rule everyone out on a blanket basis _meta_end_dot_

 does this rule apply as well to cabinet positions in the event that mccain wins _meta_end_question_

 well then so much for the excellent robert zoellick being secretary of state can t have a former ustr and a deputy secretary of state from the bush administration after all _meta_end_dot_

 and no jobs for john bolton zalmay khalilzad john negroponte or any other people who actually did good if relatively unheralded work during the bush administration s time in office _meta_end_dot_

 before cheney got picked everyone talked about what a wonderful chief of staff he was for ford what a wonderful minority whip he was in the house what an excellent secretary of defense he was for bush the elder and what a terrific president he would be if only his ticker would be kind to him _meta_end_dot_

 then he got picked and he has been portrayed as the antichrist ever since _meta_end_dot_

 no matter how appealing the person he she is going to get slammed as the worst thing to happen to planet earth since menudo _meta_end_dot_

 we may as well pick a competent and smart person for the other side to shoot at _meta_end_dot_

 mark i so much better than i could have said it _meta_end_dot_

 academicelephant i suppose he could pick a powell or an armitage _meta_end_dot_

 thomas crown i actually have a side bet with a friend who owes me a few hundred over the florida primary results that he picks powell _meta_end_dot_

 academicelephant powell s age is the problem there that s why i thought of armitage _meta_end_dot_

 thomas crown powell s military record and his ability to appeal to squishy idiots who don t think about politics offsets the age issue or at least that s why i m giving my friend a chance to get his money back _meta_end_dot_

 jeff emanuel seriously _meta_end_question_

 he could a pick a guy who oversaw a status quo gum on the shoe state department in much the same go along get along fashion as rice not to mention who has been going out of his way to badmouth the current administration and the global war on terror effort _meta_end_question_

 i know that i said divorcing himself from bush would help mccain but powell s leftward spin on the gwot plus the fact that he is i believe pro choice would lose a good portion of that conservative base that mccain is still having trouble sewing up as evidenced in part by the upside down mccain flags in signature lines here _meta_end_dot_

 or b pick the guy who actually outed valerie plame _meta_end_question_

 that s a great decision and a wonderful way to both tie himself to a fake but publicly outrageous melodrama associated with the white house while getting little or nothing of value out of it electorally or popularly _meta_end_dot_

 i think both of those potential selections have to be ruled out out of hand _meta_end_dot_

 thomas crown whoah there _meta_end_dot_

 i agree about armitage aside from political junkies who care about valerie wilson who even knows or cares about him _meta_end_question_

 but i disagree on powell _meta_end_dot_

 first powell commands enormous respect for exactly the same reasons mccain does he s ex military and he s a safe republican who breaks with the republican brand early and often _meta_end_dot_

 you d have the military maverick ticket right there _meta_end_dot_

 yeah you d lose some conservatives not as many as you suggest but some but you d pick up a lot of the idiots who get distracted by bright flashy things yet whom we still allow to vote _meta_end_dot_

 we re talking about what mccain should do if he wants to win not what he should do if he wants to make us happy _meta_end_dot_

 he d be a first order fool not to tap powell _meta_end_dot_

 academicelephant i m not saying i think either is a good idea but i do understand the enormous appeal of powell who is something of a national saint to much of the nation compliments mccain s military credentials and bear in mind most people think he was right about gwot policy at this point _meta_end_dot_

 dismiss away if you will but i bet they re both getting serious consideration _meta_end_dot_

 blackhedd disregard this if the point has already been made _meta_end_dot_

 but mccain is unusual among recent republican nominees in that he has significant potential appeal to moderates _meta_end_dot_

 i m not a squish but i ll trade ideological purity to get power any day of the week ergo we shouldn t be afraid to look for someone with strong appeal to the base read strong on defense _meta_end_dot_

 i can see both powell except for his age and armitage in this role _meta_end_dot_

 powell has the advantage of meeting my first requirement which is an individual who unquestionably is ready to take over the presidency at any time _meta_end_dot_

 interestingly obama will be in the same situation assuming he can overcome our effort to reveal his true nature as a near radical left wing liberal _meta_end_dot_

 meaning he has strong potential appeal to moderates _meta_end_dot_

 and so he ll probably be looking for a retired general to be his veep to fill in his weakness on defense and security _meta_end_dot_

 haystack obama would likely take wes clark if that were his primary criteria sheesh but would that be bad well good for the fight bad if he actually won this thing _meta_end_dot_

 jeff emanuel wes clark is a rhodes scholar with a degree in economics who somehow believes that america was founded on a progressive income tax that s scary enough in itself mismanagement of bosnia kosovo aside _meta_end_dot_

 blackhedd if i were obama my attitude would be winning is everything _meta_end_dot_

 michelle can sort out the personnel problems after we have power _meta_end_dot_

 haystack i would personally be very un amused with a powell pick but his position on iraq and the greater me rides quite well with mods and indies my amusement is no longer relevant however there s a general to prepare for after all _meta_end_dot_

 the i s and m s are allegedly voting in pretty large numbers with the we need a change of course in iraq crowd in the polls we keep hearing about not the code pinkers and move oners mind you but i think thomas is right to suggest that strategically this likely fares best for mccain s need to keep all the independents and the r and d moderates who are looking for love away from the far left liberal policies either of the dems are promising to beclown themselves with _meta_end_dot_

 mark kilmer general powell has publically stated that he does not know if he ll even vote republican this year granted if he is asked he wants it and he and mccain are able to talk alma into it he ll vote r if he s on the ticket _meta_end_dot_

 if mccain wants to try to appear to go the post partisan route the one on which obama took a wrong turn powell would be a natch it would tick me off though having worn this r on my lapel _meta_end_dot_

 for what _meta_end_question_

 as for timing i m on both sides of the fence part of me says mcc should do it now part of me says he should wait til the dem nominee is known probably at the convention heck why burn up press time until he needs to let the dems keep bleeding let mcc keep getting donations in relative peace and tranquility _meta_end_dot_

 dan mclaughlin _meta_number_ref_ i got confused because i thought thomas was saying obama would pick powell obama s the one who needs a man in uniform mccain s got that locked already _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ i cannot even begin to fathom what armitage brings to the table if we re going for an outside the box member of the bush cabinet i d rather take john ashcroft i m not suggesting ashcroft because i stand by what jeff and i have been saying here about making a break from bush but at least he d bring some things to the table he s well known and probably still popular in missouri he s unquestionably qualified having been a governor senator and attorney general he d cement mccain with the base particularly conservative christians he s earned strange new respect for the things that have come out about his battles behind the scenes on surveillance and his competence at his job was vividly illustrated by contrast to his successor _meta_end_dot_

 pejman yousefzadeh it should be noted in addition that powell is advising the obama camp on foreign policy _meta_end_dot_

 thomas crown you re kidding me _meta_end_dot_

 no wait you re not _meta_end_dot_

 wow _meta_end_dot_

 i still say he s mccain s best choice _meta_end_dot_

 ben domenech mccain needs to decide whether what he needs in a vp is a role player or a president in waiting sanford would be the best all around choice but he essentially becomes the frontrunner for potus in _meta_number_ref_ years and that has to factor into mccain s choice sorry but i really think it will i think this may tempt mccain as it will any senator to choose someone closer to his heart someone older someone who won t have an eye on his chair and someone who he trusts after sanford did not re endorse him this time around _meta_end_dot_

 this is incidentally the reason why i m glad huckabee stayed in it past his curtain call he reminded mccain that the guy couldn t get away with picking hagel or lindsey graham if not for huck i think mccain graham would be a very real possibility i think romney is a net negative i think pawlenty is a tossup i think portman is a slight benefit i think carcieri would make a lot of people say huh but they might warm to him i think charlie crist would just be so _meta_end_dot_

 special and i think sanford remains the best all around choice _meta_end_dot_

 as for the more glam picks of the cycle barbour palin and jindal they all have enough on their hands frankly and i think only barbour would actually say yes if asked but mccain doesn t really like barbour all that much i think and we ve already gone through the laundry list of reasons why the normal conservative candidates just don t fit the bill _meta_end_dot_

 in this case i think mccain has several good potential choices and only a few who would be total trainwrecks when vetting is done he should announce his choice early perhaps in the gap before puerto rico and lock up the see how they all get along media for a while _meta_end_dot_

 pejman yousefzadeh he should announce his pick right before the democratic national convention begins and rob it of oxygen assuming that we are not indeed headed towards witnessing internecine warfare in denver thus august _meta_end_dot_

 thomas crown i would hit it just after the pr primaries that brief lull when the dust is settling and everyone wants to talk about the ds is a great time to steal some thunder _meta_end_dot_

 academicelephant how old is scowcroft _meta_end_question_

 pejman yousefzadeh _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 dan mclaughlin he s _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 seriously mccain needs someone whose _meta_number_ref_ thing is domestic policy cred _meta_end_dot_

 not another foreign policy professional who hasn t been outside the beltway in decades _meta_end_dot_

 charles bird as i wrote about here and i know i m well in the minority i think mccain should pick bobby jindal _meta_end_dot_

 because of obama s youth jindal s youth is a significantly less relevant issue _meta_end_dot_

 jindal is off the charts smart and even though he s decade younger than obama his resume is already superior _meta_end_dot_

 what s more jindal is a rock solid catholic conservative and a southern governor to boot _meta_end_dot_

 he is the perfect balance to a mccain ticket _meta_end_dot_

 i know that he hasn t spent enough time in the governor s chair but mccain can say that our country needs jindal in national office but to compensate taking him out of louisiana so soon he would appoint jindal as his first duty as vice president to oversee the reconstruction of new orleans bay st _meta_end_dot_

 louis and other areas that are still devastated by katrina _meta_end_dot_
