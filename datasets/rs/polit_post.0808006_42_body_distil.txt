  the reaction to barack obama s address on race has been as close to universally positive as any post speech reaction that i have seen in a long time _meta_end_dot_

 to be sure the speech itself is well written and the stagecraft that accompanied it was pitch perfect _meta_end_dot_

 additionally i have no problem saying that there is a great deal about the speech that i liked and approved of _meta_end_dot_

 obama did point out quite properly that jeremiah wright s incendiary comments sounded like they were stuck in the past and reproached his pastor for thinking that we have not come a long way as a country since the worst days of racism _meta_end_dot_

 he should be applauded for that _meta_end_dot_

 yet in a number of ways obama s speech fell short both rhetorically and substantively _meta_end_dot_

 there has been a surplus of praise and relatively few critiquesof the speech _meta_end_dot_

 maybe obama just did such a brilliant job that no critiques are possible _meta_end_dot_

 but speechmaking is a human enterprise and barack obama popular opinion to the contrary notwithstanding is human _meta_end_dot_

 it should come as no surprise that there were shortcomings in the speech and given that obama is running for the presidency it behooves us to examine those shortcomings thoroughly _meta_end_dot_

 read on _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 consider for example the following not supposed to misrepresent history and jeremiah wright s comments went well beyond the mere creation of a difference of opinion to actively and deliberately misrepresent history _meta_end_dot_

 and if the misrepresentation of history was not deliberate if wright actually believed what he was saying he should have been corrected quickly respectfully and yet forcefully _meta_end_dot_

 one of barack obama s key strengths is the ability to take in a particular point of view demonstrate that he understands that point of view afford or appear to afford that point of view the respect that it deserves we are assuming for the purpose of this passage that this point of view is a mainstream one that differs from obama s views and then respond by saying that he looks at the issue under discussion from a different angle and having listened he would like to present his side of the story _meta_end_dot_

 this approach causes his interlocutor to believe that he she has been listened to by obama and furthermore causes the interlocutor to feel obliged to listen to obama in turn and potentially be persuaded by him _meta_end_dot_

 one cannot help but wonder why obama did not use this gift to turn wright around if he objected as strongly as he says he did to wright s words _meta_end_dot_

 i don t believe for a moment that obama subscribes to wright s worldview i take him at his word that he does not _meta_end_dot_

 but it is more than a little strange that obama didn t seek to persuade wright of the error of his views _meta_end_dot_

 a pastor priest or rabbi has a leadership role with relation to the congregation _meta_end_dot_

 but the congregant can lead too _meta_end_dot_

 obama had a chance to lead wright to a more sustainable and fact based worldview _meta_end_dot_

 he failed to do so _meta_end_dot_

 indeed he didn t even try _meta_end_dot_

 as for the passage about obama s grandmother many have said that this amounts to obama throwing his grandmother under the bus i disagree but the passage is still not appropriate to the discussion _meta_end_dot_

 one does not choose one s own grandmother and to disown a blood relative is utterly wrenching and for many people impossible _meta_end_dot_

 if obama s grandmother made inappropriate statement alpha and jeremiah wright made the same statement or a similar one it would be far easier for obama to disown wright than it would be to disown his own blood relation especially given the key role that blood relation played in raising obama _meta_end_dot_

 of course there is something to be said for standing by a friend and obama wants to stand by wright _meta_end_dot_

 fine _meta_end_dot_

 but as referenced above could he not have used his considerable persuasive skills to try to wean wright from his worldview a worldview that obama objects to and condemns _meta_end_question_

 and it should be mentioned that obama seeks to have it both ways when it comes to his relationship with wright _meta_end_dot_

 in the speech he announces that he cannot disown his pastor _meta_end_dot_

 but in a very real sense he already has _meta_end_dot_

 indeed over a year ago wright was disowned or at the very least a considerable distance was placed between wright and his former congregant when obama disinvited wright from the launching of his presidential campaign in springfield illinois in february of last year _meta_end_dot_

 so what s the deal here _meta_end_question_

 does obama stand with wright _meta_end_question_

 or does he just stand with wright except for the times when he doesn t _meta_end_question_

 obama notes that there remains a simmering anger on the part of many groups when it comes to race relations _meta_end_dot_

 he is quite right _meta_end_dot_

 understandably on a whole host of fronts feelings are very raw _meta_end_dot_

 we ought to understand that and take this fact into account _meta_end_dot_

 if we do not we court folly and disaster _meta_end_dot_

 but let s understand as well that simmering anger is no basis and no excuse for the kinds of misrepresentations of history that wright engaged in during his sermons _meta_end_dot_

 nor would they excuse similarly outrageous claims made by whites who as obama explains may have their own reasons to be bitter _meta_end_dot_

 in particular a community leader like wright has a special obligation to be careful and temperate when it comes to his choice of words and that obligation extends to white community leaders who are similarly situated _meta_end_dot_

 demagoguery is not excusable _meta_end_dot_

 ignorance concerning history is not excusable _meta_end_dot_

 demagoguery and ignorance must must be corrected by responsible people on both sides of the racial divide _meta_end_dot_

 those who make demagogic and ignorant statements lessen their status as leaders in the eyes of the community at large _meta_end_dot_

 and those who remain silent when demagogic or ignorant statements are made or those who cheer those statements on fail the test of leadership from the first instance _meta_end_dot_

 so it is valuable for obama to explain wright s worldview _meta_end_dot_

 and it is valuable for him to empathize with the bitterness some whites may feel _meta_end_dot_

 but at the end of the day wrong is wrong _meta_end_dot_

 wrong must be challenged _meta_end_dot_

 and what is wrong ought finally to be put right _meta_end_dot_

 obama does much to put things right in his speech but he should have owned up to his failure to do so as a congregant prior to the speech _meta_end_dot_

 if he actually did try to do so we are left unaware _meta_end_dot_

 when it comes to leadership perhaps we might say better late than never but even if we take that view why be late at all _meta_end_question_

 and then of course there was this all conservative commentary on the issue of race and racism bogus _meta_end_question_

 is it possible that conservatives may have had a point here and there or that contemporary liberals may have made a few bogus blunders of their own _meta_end_question_

 and this oh my god maw i think my eardrum just exploded indeed _meta_end_dot_

 evidently we americans need to stop being afraid of each other and we should just be afraid of the damn furriners who might come and pickpocket us out of our livelihoods _meta_end_dot_

 transcending domestic racism with international protectionism is nothing to boast about _meta_end_dot_

 and in the end despite what obama s passionate admirers say the speech was not the transcendent piece of oratory they make it out to be _meta_end_dot_

 i applaud obama for the effort _meta_end_dot_

 it was good in a number of places _meta_end_dot_

 but there needs to be a follow up conversation not just because the issue of race is so complex and challenging but also because in a very real sense barack obama s speech failed _meta_end_dot_
