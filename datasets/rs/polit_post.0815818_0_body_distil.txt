  it s a very busy morning as financial markets digest a welter of new information _meta_end_dot_

 the headline you ll have screamed at you all day is that the us unemployment rate jumped sharply from _meta_number_ref_ _meta_percent_ref_ to _meta_number_ref_ _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 the unemployment rate is a number that matters in terms of politics and very little else _meta_end_dot_

 the useful number that economists and markets actually watch is the total number of jobs _meta_end_dot_

 according the labor department s bureau of labor statistics the initial reading on actual employment during the month of may is that _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ us jobs were lost _meta_end_dot_

 this is a bad number but it s not as bad as expected _meta_end_dot_

 the survey of economists showed a wider variance than usual this month but the average was about _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ accordingly market reaction is muted this morning _meta_end_dot_

 the stock market will probably drop _meta_number_ref_ or so points retracing yesterday s rally _meta_end_dot_

 bonds rose modestly on the news _meta_end_dot_

 update at _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_am edt the new york stock market is down well over _meta_number_ref_ points bonds are mildly higher across the curve and crude oil is now an incredible _meta_percent_ref_ more expensive than it was yesterday _meta_end_dot_

 keep reading _meta_end_dot_

 as has been the case in every monthly bls report for some time now the us economy showed sharp job losses in manufacturing and construction _meta_end_dot_

 unlike recent reports retail unemployment was also down which may explain the recent unexpectedly good results from wal mart and other large retail chains _meta_end_dot_

 also a surprise was a decline in professional employment _meta_end_dot_

 law firms seem to have stopped growing for the time being at least _meta_end_dot_

 which sectors added jobs in may _meta_end_question_

 leisure and hospitality did well but the big winner was government _meta_end_dot_

 direct government employment increased as did education and healthcare which is greatly exposed to government spending _meta_end_dot_

 moving on to the other piece of market moving news yesterday the chief of the european central bank jean claude trichet hinted that euro interest rates may rise next month _meta_end_dot_

 that set off an avalanche of selling in the dollar and it touched off an enormous wave of buying in crude oil which was around _meta_dollor_ref_ barrel yesterday morning and is now near _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 what happened in crude oil _meta_end_question_

 well all the talk of a global economic slowdown led to expectations that demand for oil would fall _meta_end_dot_

 but remember what i ve been saying for many months now financial pressure is now at least as important as supply and demand in the crude oil market _meta_end_dot_

 demand for oil is certainly expected to continue falling in the coming months which puts downward pressure on oil prices _meta_end_dot_

 but with the prospect of a higher interest rate spread between the dollar and the euro and the wicked flattening of the euro yield curve that immediately followed trichet s remarks people are looking for a dollar hedge more than ever _meta_end_dot_

 and crude oil is just about the best dollar hedge available these days _meta_end_dot_
