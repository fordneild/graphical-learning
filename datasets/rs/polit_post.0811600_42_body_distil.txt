  john judis is a big fan and booster of democratic electoral prospects which means that he likely reacts negatively in response to right of center talking points concerning whether certain democratic candidates are ideologically beyond the pale _meta_end_dot_

 interestingly enough however it would seem that judis has a lot of sympathy for right of center talking points concerning whether barack obama may be ideologically beyond the pale and who knows _meta_end_question_

 at least a few of those superdelegates might listen _meta_end_dot_

 no wonder hillary clinton isn t leaving the race _meta_end_dot_
