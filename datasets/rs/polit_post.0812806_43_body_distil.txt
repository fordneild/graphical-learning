  it is generally agreed by those who are actually in the know when it comes to the specifics of trade policy and how free trade genuinely benefits america that both barack obama and hillary clinton are moving heaven and earth to pander to protectionists for votes _meta_end_dot_

 but as daniel ikenson points out in the runup to tonight s primaries in indiana and north carolina both pandering to free traders is the smart thing to do read on _meta_end_dot_

 there is a lot more good news which we wouldn t have around if protectionists had their way when you click on the link _meta_end_dot_

 and lo and behold it would seem that ikenson s advice was taken protectionists as well _meta_end_dot_

 and full time free traders are needed to implement prosperity inducing policies _meta_end_dot_

 i have no idea whether the free trade or protectionist versions of barack obama or hillary clinton would inhabit the oval office and make decisions when it comes to trade policy _meta_end_dot_

 i do know however that john mccain has an impeccable trade record and that i have heard much too much protectionist talk from clinton and obama not to mention a whole host of others in the democratic party to be comfortable entrusting trade policy to them _meta_end_dot_
