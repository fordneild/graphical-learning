  i m sending some money to fred thompson today _meta_end_dot_

 you can if you want _meta_end_dot_

 or you can give to the candidate of your choice _meta_end_dot_

 with christmas time coming around i m a fan of giving money to non profits like the salvation army _meta_end_dot_

 but i think this year it would be worth it to put up links to the candidates so you can throw some dough their way _meta_end_dot_

 i m leaving out the bottom tier candidates _meta_end_dot_

 no need to waste your money on folks who ve shown themselves to lack viability _meta_end_dot_

 but for the rest here are the donation links
