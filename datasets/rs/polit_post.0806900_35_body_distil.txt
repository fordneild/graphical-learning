  hillary and billy are dropping hints about the dem dream ticket with hillary as the nominee barry in the veep slot _meta_end_dot_

 democrats everywhere think the dream ticket would be unstoppable _meta_end_exclamation_

 in _meta_number_ref_ john kerry called himself and john edwards dream ticket what kind of nightmare are we having _meta_end_question_

 this takes me back to _meta_number_ref_ when alpha male naomi wolf and her earth tones made love train by the ojays al gore s very temporary campaign theme _meta_end_dot_

 i thought the song would fit for barry by himself and we shall see but for the purposes of this open thread let s think of it in the context of the fictional clinton obama _meta_number_ref_ ticket _meta_end_dot_

 people all over the world join hands
