  this morning senator john mccain speaks at wake forest university _meta_end_dot_

 the speech begins at _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ a m _meta_end_dot_

 present with him will be senator fred thompson _meta_end_dot_

 that s important _meta_end_dot_

 we ve seen already that thompson has been more visible in recent weeks _meta_end_dot_

 why _meta_end_question_

 well he s decided to come out and support his friend _meta_end_dot_

 he is for conservatives what joe lieberman is for moderate squishes a reassurance that john mccain will hear us _meta_end_dot_

 and given thompson s track record of getting mccain to listen to him which is very good we should take comfort in his presence by mccain today and on the campaign trail _meta_end_dot_

 no i don t think this signals thompson as veep in fact i m positive it does not _meta_end_dot_

 what i do think this signals is that thompson is the guy mccain will listen to on conservative issues thompson will be the judge sherpa making sure there are no harriet miers moments and plenty of john roberts moments _meta_end_dot_

 i ve said of barack obama that we should look to the people surrounding him who are advising him _meta_end_dot_

 machiavelli suggests that is the best way to get to know a leader _meta_end_dot_

 on judicial matters barack obama surrounds himself with people like kamala harris the far left district attorney of san francisco a woman who would not even seek the death penalty for a cop killer and has sided with criminals against the san francisco police _meta_end_dot_

 john mccain on the other hand has fred thompson standing next to him _meta_end_dot_

 the contrast could not be greater and conservatives who have thought about sitting this one out better look at kamala harris v _meta_end_dot_

 fred thompson and think again _meta_end_dot_

 read on _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 in mccain s speech he will say as if throwing a bone to feddie mccain is even going after penumbras emanations and the ninth circuit today _meta_end_dot_

 that s reassuring _meta_end_dot_
