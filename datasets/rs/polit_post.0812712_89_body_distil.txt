  the us immigrations and customs enforcement bureau seeks to identify criminal aliens for a very simple reason _meta_end_dot_

 they want to catch these malefactors and return them to their various and sundry spawning holes _meta_end_dot_

 their portion of the dhs website describes their goals in the following flowery prose _meta_end_dot_

 the criminal alien program cap focuses on identifying criminal aliens who are incarcerated within federal state and local facilities thereby ensuring that they are not released into the community by securing a final order of removal prior to the termination of their sentence _meta_end_dot_

 this doesn t register in most us states _meta_end_dot_

 there are some illegal immigrants everywhere but in most states the problem remains on the b list of most of the citizenry _meta_end_dot_

 things are different in close proximity to the southern us border _meta_end_dot_

 in travis county texas the ice has egregiously worked to execute their mandate _meta_end_dot_

 the situation has led to utter controversy _meta_end_dot_

 this controversy points to an ongoing problem at dhs _meta_end_dot_

 people disrespect them when they shirk their duties but dhs makes real enemies when it does its assigned tasks _meta_end_dot_

 the austin american statesman points out some of the grim facts of life faced by ice agents in texas _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ estimated number of visas for low skilled workers in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ estimated number of low skilled mexican workers who entered the u s _meta_end_dot_

 illegally in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ approximate number of illegal immigrants removed in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ approximate number removed with criminal histories _meta_end_dot_

 these statistics point to a number of trends that should have people spitting nails _meta_end_dot_

 we ll start with the pathetically ornamental visa program _meta_end_dot_

 this was apparently intended to be a truce on two conditions _meta_end_dot_

 one the authorities would know who was coming in from abroad and two they d be able to use the applications as a filter _meta_end_dot_

 let s look at stat numero dos and see how that cease fire has worked out for the great state of texas _meta_end_dot_

 doing the math between these rom estimates gives you the sense that the dhs has cognizance of the identity and background of _meta_percent_ref_ of the low skilled foreign nationals crossing the border to seek employment in the united states _meta_end_dot_

 this makes the sum of all fears scenario laid out by tom clancy a very realistic one _meta_end_dot_

 the third and forth stats also seem to give reason for the casual observer to wonder as former congressman james trafficant once did during a one minute special order why our border enforcement agency went through the motions with its head ensconced within the folds of its large intestine _meta_end_dot_

 out of the _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ that get in _meta_percent_ref_ are getting caught and sent back _meta_end_dot_

 in my humble opinion this number is flat out awful _meta_end_dot_

 it s also grotesquely inflated and doesn t tell how badly the us does in securing our national borders _meta_end_dot_

 out those _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ that got returned to sender _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ got nabbed by local authorities first _meta_end_dot_

 in other words they got to the united states illegally they set up shop and then again violated the law _meta_end_dot_

 at that point a local sheriff or other police agency did the dhs job for them and apprehended these people _meta_end_dot_

 dhs at least showed the wisdom to take out this garbage through the cap _meta_end_dot_

 assuming the _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ would not have been apprehended and deported without the local authorities the number of successful apprehensions and deportations by _meta_number_ref_ of the _meta_number_ref_ influx would have only equaled approximately _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 this would be a shade lower than _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 the local law enforcement agencies in places like yuma az and austin tx now operate high pass filters on behalf of the parts of our federal government that have not been supported well enough to do their work _meta_end_dot_

 if i were a pro immigrant activist i would at least show some gratitude that this was happening _meta_end_dot_

 a lot of the people leaving mexico and el salvador are trying to escape people just like those who wind up with the dregs in the travis county lockdown and get sent back _meta_end_dot_

 the people who have violated us sovereignty for the somewhat benign purpose of finding gainful employment don t have to be segregated right next to the ones who cross our border to sell more narcotics or run organized criminal enterprises _meta_end_dot_

 but no the idea of law enforcement agencies deporting criminals bothers the terminally self righteous who will never have to live within ten miles of an illegal alien smuggling ring or a crack house _meta_end_dot_

 an immigration attorney in austin displays just this level of ignorant contempt for the laws that allow him the status of being an officer of the court _meta_end_dot_

 dan kowalski an immigration attorney who is not involved in the local protests said he would rather see ice focus on catching the worst criminals that it and other federal agencies are already tracking _meta_end_dot_

 by that i mean gangbangers human smugglers drug runners _meta_end_dot_

 there are probably enough out there that it s a rich pool of target for ice to go after instead of trying to pick up someone whose visa expired he said _meta_end_dot_

 another attorney in austin obliquely compares enforcing america s immigration rules with enforcing the fugitive slave act and denying women s sufferage _meta_end_dot_

 we can t stop what we re doing just because he says i m not going to change said nicole true an austin criminal defense attorney who compared opponents efforts with fights to abolish slavery and to give women the right to vote _meta_end_dot_

 people said then well that s just the way it is _meta_end_dot_

 we re just enforcing the law but you know what _meta_end_question_

 sometimes the law isn t just finally attorney kowalski tells us his real heartache over this entire effort _meta_end_dot_

 having to oppose lawful efforts to remove felonious individuals with no legal right to have come here to commit their nefarious deeds in the first place makes him look callous with regards to law and order _meta_end_dot_

 it makes us look like we don t care about the law and really we should be focused on changing the law so that we don t need all these enforcement efforts or need fewer of them or more targeted ones he said _meta_end_dot_

 i can give kowalski an obvious suggestion he doesn t want to hear _meta_end_dot_

 if we finished building the fence on our southern border it would be a whole lot harder for felons to act like felons here _meta_end_dot_

 then the travis county sheriff s office could focus on our home grown termagants and let central american wag halters and cutthroats run afoul of los federales instead _meta_end_dot_

 this would get the great state of texas out of the business of providing dhs with a highpass alien filter and attorney kowalski wouldn t have to feel conflicted in the slightest _meta_end_dot_

 that would be perfect for him wouldn t it _meta_end_question_

 never _meta_end_dot_
