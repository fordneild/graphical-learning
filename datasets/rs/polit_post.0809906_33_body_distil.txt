  in a period when we are beset with calls for increased regulation as a supposedly surefire way to stop any further financial rough patches like the one we are going through in the wake of the subprime mortgage mess it is useful and encouraging to note that at least one person has kept his head about him some people do _meta_end_dot_

 but they forget that regulations like sarbanes oxley haven t exactly had a tremendously impressive track record of success _meta_end_dot_

 and they are forgetting the reasons why the subprime crisis reared its aesthetically displeasing head in the first place _meta_end_dot_

 greenspan reminds them
