  second analysis from susa _meta_number_ref_ state polls _meta_end_dot_

 let s look at the actual head to head poll numbers to see what the new map looks like _meta_end_dot_

 i will define a state where a candidate leads by _meta_number_ref_ or more percentage points as red or blue in the mccain obama matchup the follow _meta_number_ref_ states are red ok _meta_number_ref_ ky _meta_number_ref_ ar wy wv tn la _meta_number_ref_ al ga id ms az ut _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 no big surprises there with the south and mountain west well represented _meta_end_dot_

 the following _meta_number_ref_ are blue vt _meta_number_ref_ hi _meta_number_ref_ il _meta_number_ref_ ct _meta_number_ref_ ri _meta_number_ref_ wa ny me md wi ca oh _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 again no big surprises although oh making the list can t be good news for republicans _meta_end_dot_

 wi and oh were both nail biters in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 rs could have hoped that mccain would improve the odds in wa and ct compared to bush but it seems obama support in those states is quite strong _meta_end_dot_

 in the mccain clinton matchup the following _meta_number_ref_ states are red ut _meta_number_ref_ id _meta_number_ref_ wy _meta_number_ref_ ne ak ga _meta_number_ref_ mt nd in az sd al _meta_number_ref_ la va _meta_end_dot_

 all states where bush did well but notably different from the mccain obama list _meta_end_dot_

 seeing va on the solid red list should be reassuring to rs _meta_end_dot_

 the following _meta_number_ref_ states are blue note that _meta_number_ref_ of those are by margins of _meta_number_ref_ or _meta_number_ref_ ny _meta_number_ref_ ma _meta_number_ref_ ri _meta_number_ref_ il _meta_number_ref_ ar vt oh ct ca _meta_end_dot_

 mostly blue states but clinton obviously has a major personal appeal to ar which goes from red to blue if clinton wins the primary _meta_end_dot_

 again the presence of oh has to be disconcerting to republicans _meta_end_dot_

 hopefully this oh sample was more democratic than the voting populace and this is an outlier _meta_end_dot_

 the rather important thing to note is that only _meta_number_ref_ states breakout of an _meta_number_ref_ point margin i e _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 that is a very strong base for senator mccain across the country to work with _meta_end_dot_

 on the flip side that means this polling has senator clinton winning more states narrowly and enough to win the general election _meta_end_dot_

 let s turn to swing states which i will define as states where a candidate leads by _meta_number_ref_ or less which is usually about the margin of error on this type of poll _meta_end_dot_

 below the fold in the mccain obama race there are _meta_number_ref_ such states listed from most pro r to least sd _meta_number_ref_ ne _meta_number_ref_ sc _meta_number_ref_ fl _meta_number_ref_ nc _meta_number_ref_ tx _meta_number_ref_ nj _meta_number_ref_ va _meta_number_ref_ mi _meta_number_ref_ nh _meta_number_ref_ nd _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 this is a very different purple map than _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 besides familiar mi nh and fl this map is made up of mostly _meta_number_ref_ red states along with nj _meta_end_dot_

 in a matchup again obama mccain s challenge will be to shore up support in generally conservative states nd sd nc sc tx and ne _meta_end_dot_

 some are plains states that are virtually _meta_percent_ref_ white and are reliably r in most respects _meta_end_dot_

 others are southern states with large black communities _meta_end_dot_

 in the mccain clinton race there are _meta_number_ref_ such states mo _meta_number_ref_ wa _meta_number_ref_ mi _meta_number_ref_ nm _meta_number_ref_ tn _meta_number_ref_ pa _meta_number_ref_ hi _meta_number_ref_ mn _meta_number_ref_ wi _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 this list is closer to the _meta_number_ref_ purple list with mo nm pa mn mi and wi back for another round _meta_end_dot_

 but tn wa an hi were not close in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 this seems to suggest that the clinton bush years have created the current map and by having a clinton on the ballot that map stays relevant _meta_end_dot_
