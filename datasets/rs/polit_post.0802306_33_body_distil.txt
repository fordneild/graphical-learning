  it goes without saying that a cut of _meta_number_ref_ basis points is a big deal _meta_end_dot_

 fortunately today s market panic was focused in the early morning and the dow did not fall by as much as was feared _meta_end_dot_

 i imagine that in the short term people will be concerned by the deepness of the fed cut as it indicates slower times ahead _meta_end_dot_

 but the cut will likely help the recovery pick up speed once the slowdown whatever its nature is over _meta_end_dot_

 and yes inflation remains a problem but right now economic growth is the number one priority _meta_end_dot_

 once economic growth resumes at an acceptable and respectable level the fed will have breathing room to increase rates in order to combat inflation _meta_end_dot_

 in the meantime there is no reason why we can t celebrate a bit of good news _meta_end_dot_
