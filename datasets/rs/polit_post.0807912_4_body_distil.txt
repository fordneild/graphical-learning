  okinawa jack joins team clinton _meta_end_dot_

 via hot air if team obama has the collective brains to tan the hide of a pygmy shrew they ll be thanking god in a loud voice that they missed out on this super delegate faster than you can say culture of corruption yes yes he s okinawa jack murtha but he s also as ed points out above the king of pork _meta_end_dot_

 perfect chance to move to the center in a way that most of obama s supporters won t even really mind and hey the guy s a heretic now right _meta_end_question_

 no downside all around _meta_end_dot_

 so you progressives will be going after murtha now right _meta_end_question_
