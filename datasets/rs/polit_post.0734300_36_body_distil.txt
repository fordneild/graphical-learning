  well congratulations to romney supporters everywhere _meta_end_dot_

 they pushed out the huckabee story on aids from _meta_number_ref_ i was in high school at the time surfing bbs s because algore hadn t really made the internets publicly available to all at the time today getting it up on drudge and across the blogosphere _meta_end_dot_

 after doing so huckabee released a statement saying sad on both counts _meta_end_dot_

 sad to see huck ditch a fiscally conservative position _meta_end_dot_

 sad to see romney supporters going after a _meta_number_ref_ statement given their guy s statements in both _meta_number_ref_ and _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 perhaps it is time to stick to current issues on all sides _meta_end_dot_

 does anyone really want to relive the _meta_number_ref_ s _meta_end_question_

 if so say hello to president clinton _meta_end_dot_

 update look a lot of romney supporters are upset at my accusation that romney supporters are pushing this story _meta_end_dot_

 here s why i say that _meta_number_ref_ reporters are lazy and you re full of it if you think the ap itself came up with this story _meta_end_dot_

 someone gave it to them _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ i have close ties to folks in the mccain and thompson camp and cordial ties to the giuliani camp _meta_end_dot_

 not one of those camps pushed this information out there to me before or after the ap story _meta_end_dot_
