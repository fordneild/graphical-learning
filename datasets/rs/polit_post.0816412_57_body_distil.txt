  pennsylvania congressman paul kanjorski d has made news for both accidental honesty and ill timed transparent duplicity in the last couple weeks _meta_end_dot_

 now in an attempt to control that damage and prevent further gaffes which would cause damage to his apparently keystone state sized ego kanjorski is refusing to answer any questions about the statements that previously got him into trouble with the media the voters and his congressional democrat masters _meta_end_dot_

 video below note watch the female staffer s face when she realizes what charlie is about to ask her boss apparently being number two or less to ex marine jack murtha can work wonders for a man s ego as well as his self assurance that he need never apologize to anybody for what he may have said or done _meta_end_dot_

 clearly mr _meta_end_dot_

 kanjorski would rather we all forget his admission that democrats used and abused the naive trusting anti war code pink left in order to win back congress as well as his braggadocios claim after vocally and vigorously opposing the _meta_number_ref_ surge in iraq that he and democrats actually forced president bush into enacting that successful strategy _meta_end_dot_

 unfortunately for rep _meta_end_dot_

 kanjorski d we won t forget or ignore that _meta_end_dot_

 and neither should the voters of pennsylvania _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_
