  here s my charlton heston story _meta_end_dot_

 when i was a teenager and a lowly intern for human events i spent my days writing about all sorts of topics that were let s face it not interesting enough to the editors to assign real paid journalists _meta_end_dot_

 once i wrote an article about gun rights and an attack on them via a bill before the house of representatives _meta_end_dot_

 it was a slightly different attack than those usually employed by the gun grabbers as i recall but the details are lost to me _meta_end_dot_

 in any case i went to a few hearings i talked to a few staffers and i wrote about it _meta_end_dot_

 about a week after the story ran i came back to my desk to find a pink while you were out note from the office secretary _meta_end_dot_

 someone from then national rifle association president charlton heston s office had called the note said asking for copies of my article _meta_end_dot_

 please return call for address _meta_end_dot_

 i dialed the number _meta_end_dot_

 a man picked up _meta_end_dot_

 and i heard charlton heston say hello i was stunned into silence for a moment _meta_end_dot_

 i glanced at the note it was a california area code _meta_end_dot_

 i realized it did not say charlton heston s office had called that had been assumed _meta_end_dot_

 no it was the man himself _meta_end_dot_

 i had no idea what to say _meta_end_dot_

 uh mr _meta_end_dot_

 heston i m calling from human events and i heard you were interested in copies of my article oh yes he replied _meta_end_dot_

 could i send a few copies of the issue over to him he asked _meta_end_question_

 but of course _meta_end_dot_

 he gave me his address ending with and that most hideous of zip codes _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ i still didn t know what to say but figuring this was the only time i d end up with the actor on the phone i just added and sir let me say as a fan thank you so much for all the amazing work you ve done on screen he laughed and said no thank you i appreciate it made my week that did _meta_end_dot_

 r i p _meta_end_dot_
