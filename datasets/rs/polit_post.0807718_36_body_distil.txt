 i guess _meta_end_dot_

 of all the holidays we celebrate this is one that s always sorta been lost on me _meta_end_dot_

 back at brookside elementary i used to like getting a free green bagel but that s about it _meta_end_dot_

 now admittedly that could be because i am not a drinker _meta_end_dot_

 i ve never so much as ingested a drop _meta_end_dot_

 it s just not for me which sadly makes me an anomaly in the michigan political world where the social component of just about everything includes moderate to large amounts of hard liquor _meta_end_dot_

 today s a special day _meta_end_dot_

 i ve actually got one friend who shall remain nameless who identifies st _meta_end_dot_

 every year s he goes out and the rest of us wonder will s he survive and when will that liver shut down _meta_end_question_

 got to be the luck of the irish keeping him her going _meta_end_dot_

 ok i m through with the multiple pronouns _meta_end_dot_
