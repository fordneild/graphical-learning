  the obama campaign surprised a lot of people in the past week by suggesting that georgia was in play _meta_end_dot_

 in fact the obama campaign has begun running advertisements in georgia this week launching obama s opening ad campaign _meta_end_dot_

 this has more to do with obama trying to shape the press message than it does obama actually trying to win in georgia _meta_end_dot_

 witness this time article _meta_end_dot_

 after weeks of stories about obama not being able to win in places like pennsylvania indiana michigan florida and ohio the obama campaign is working overtime to convince the media that it can win in places it absolutely cannot _meta_end_dot_

 georgia is one of those places _meta_end_dot_

 this is of course the strategy _meta_end_dot_

 obama will win with the votes of black voters _meta_end_dot_

 and arguably his data makes the case _meta_end_dot_

 in _meta_number_ref_ only _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ voters turned out for the democratic primary _meta_end_dot_

 this year however _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ voters turned out for the democratic primary _meta_end_dot_

 that sounds impressive until you realize _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ voters turned out in the republican primary this year smaller to be sure but then everyone knew huckabee would win georgia by the time the race got here and obama could capitalize on the african american turnout _meta_end_dot_

 regardless of the impressive primary turnout let s put some concrete perspective on this _meta_end_dot_

 in georgia obama is calculating that he will have inroads because of bob barr the libertarian presidential candidate who is from georgia and the african american vote strength _meta_end_dot_

 in _meta_number_ref_ the libertarians ran garrett hayes for governor in georgia _meta_end_dot_

 hayes ran a good but underfunded campaign _meta_end_dot_

 a lot of his supporters believed he would have such an impact on the race that sonny perdue and mark taylor would be forced into a runoff _meta_end_dot_

 the democrats thought the same thing _meta_end_dot_

 in fact perdue captured _meta_percent_ref_ of the vote with hayes only getting _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 people forget that barr lost his district in _meta_number_ref_ and has not held elective office since _meta_end_dot_

 likewise barr has drifted from his conservative roots over time _meta_end_dot_

 just because he was once a georgia congressman does not mean he ll get enough support to hurt mccain _meta_end_dot_

 additionally there is the democratic party in georgia dpg itself _meta_end_dot_

 if you really think barack obama has a strong shot in georgia surely that is reflected in the dpg s candidate recruitment efforts this year _meta_end_dot_

 if barack obama is going to sweep across georgia surely his coattails will help candidates at the local level _meta_end_dot_

 actually the dpg has had a terrible candidate recruitment effort this year _meta_end_dot_

 several vulnerable republicans have gotten a free pass _meta_end_dot_

 then there is fundraising _meta_end_dot_

 the republicans in georgia have since _meta_number_ref_ organized and fundraised the democrats under the table _meta_end_dot_

 the georgia gop is well funded and has impressive organizations across the state _meta_end_dot_

 meanwhile the democrats are in near rebellion against jane kidd the dpg leader and former state representative who was unable to get herself re elected _meta_end_dot_

 she has done a craptacular job at fundraising organizing and recruiting _meta_end_dot_

 of course we should not rule out obama s ability to make georgia competitive _meta_end_dot_

 he will see huge african american turn out across the south _meta_end_dot_

 that does not shake loose history _meta_end_dot_

 georgia went for bill clinton in _meta_number_ref_ but clinton was a southern governor _meta_end_dot_

 he had cross party appeal and cross racial appeal _meta_end_dot_

 obama by and large has neither and the more he runs a campaign centered around the black vote the less likely he is to grow his base of support in georgia _meta_end_dot_

 the african american population in georgia has increased in the past year or so to close to _meta_percent_ref_ of the population _meta_end_dot_

 that usually does make the state more competitive _meta_end_dot_

 but the gop has solidified itself across the state turning it once solidly democratic to solidly republican _meta_end_dot_

 major suburban metro atlanta counties are republican _meta_end_dot_

 three of the other major metropolitan areas have large military installations that are a hotbed of republican activity _meta_end_dot_

 senator saxby chambliss a very popular republican in georgia is on the ballot _meta_end_dot_

 obama s campaign can take some comfort in the latest insider advantage polling that shows the state close but i know of few politicos in georgia on either side of the aisle who treat ia with a great deal of credibility _meta_end_dot_

 just ask lieutenant governor ralph reed _meta_end_dot_

 the speculation on georgia has more to do with changing the media narrative than it does with victory _meta_end_dot_

 obama will not win pennsylvania _meta_end_dot_

 there are other states that will become competitive for john mccain that would not be competitive for a different republican _meta_end_dot_

 but georgia will stay red as will the rest of the south _meta_end_dot_

 obama just has a money advantage right now to build hype and buzz _meta_end_dot_

 one of my favorite recent anecdotes is the urban white liberal who put a mccain bumper sticker over the bill bradley sticker on his range rover _meta_end_dot_

 obama s politics positions and lack of experience do not sell well in georgia except in areas of large african american or liberal university professor vote concentrations _meta_end_dot_

 and you cannot win georgia on those demographics _meta_end_dot_
