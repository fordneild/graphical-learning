  this morning in macon s telegraph we learn that reverend wright is headed here to preach again _meta_end_dot_

 not only that our new mayor a white man elected in this majority black city has drawn on reverend wright s more innocuous sermons in the past _meta_end_dot_

 more shocking however the mayor here is willing to give reverend wright a pass _meta_end_dot_

 oh naturally the mayor is an obama supporter _meta_end_dot_

 and while it may be socratic it is still crap _meta_end_dot_

 and while it may be socratic it is still anti american rhetoric _meta_end_dot_

 again though rev _meta_end_dot_

 wright is entitled to his views _meta_end_dot_

 these statements say more about people who listen to and follow him that they do about reverend wright _meta_end_dot_
