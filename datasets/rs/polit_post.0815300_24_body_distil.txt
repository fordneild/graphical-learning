  cnn is reporting that barack obama is leaving trinity united church of christ _meta_end_dot_

 it is a little late for that _meta_end_dot_

 he has been there for twenty years _meta_end_dot_

 why is he leaving all of a sudden _meta_end_question_

 is it because there is another untold story out there _meta_end_question_

 does he suspect the media will stop covering his connections to wright and pfleger if he now throws the church under the bus _meta_end_question_

 the way the media operates he is probably right _meta_end_dot_

 but i suspect there is one more untold story out there about obama wright pfleger and trinity _meta_end_dot_

 anyone who has ever run a political campaign objectively knows there is a double standard between democrat and republican campaign activities in churches _meta_end_dot_

 were a republican to go into a church and pass a hat for campaign dollars he d be thrown out and the irs would swarm through the church doors to yank the church s non profit status _meta_end_dot_

 with democrats very typically fundraising goes on hand in hand with campaigning from the pulpit _meta_end_dot_

 witness reverend pfleger s comments from the pulpit about hillary clinton _meta_end_dot_

 witness also the _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ in tax payer funds that barack obama secured for rev _meta_end_dot_

 pfleger s church _meta_end_dot_

 had it been for example jim demint or tom coburn getting that money for their church barry lynn and kathryn kolbert would be sending out their great hordes of lawyers to put an immediate stop to it _meta_end_dot_

 let me let you in on a little secret i ve been known to run a democrat race or two in my time _meta_end_dot_

 these are local races where in georgia at least some democrats are more conservative than some of the republicans _meta_end_dot_

 and these local campaigns involve a lot of connections with a lot of pastors particularly in the black community _meta_end_dot_

 i generally give an initial piece of advice to non partisan and democratic candidates running for office get into the black churches early and often _meta_end_dot_

 every other constituency comes after the pastors _meta_end_dot_

 the pastors are the gate keepers between the candidate and the congregation _meta_end_dot_

 the pastors can turn out the money in the congregations that have it like trinity united church of christ or particularly in the rural south the pastors can turn out the votes _meta_end_dot_

 i know of pastors endorsing from the pulpit _meta_end_dot_

 i know some pastors whose churches are broadcast on television who will keep their congregation until after the camera go off and open up about preferred candidates _meta_end_dot_

 some times they do it with the cameras on hedging their bets that the irs will not do anything _meta_end_dot_

 given the video we have seen of reverend wright and reverend pfleger stumping for obama from the pulpit and given their high level of political engagement on his behalf i suspect that they have raised money from within the church walls for barack obama _meta_end_dot_

 every candidate of every party goes into the heart of the community to campaign and raise money _meta_end_dot_

 largely for historic reasons in the black community the heart of that community is the pulpit _meta_end_dot_

 so how much money did reverend wright and reverend pfleger raise for barack obama behind their pulpits _meta_end_question_
