  so i guess a lot of people didn t see it coming that hillary clinton would refuse to concede tonight and would urge her supporters to go to her website presumably with the idea of encouraging her to keep on keeping on _meta_end_dot_

 pundits on television who are clearly in the tank for barack obama jeffrey toobin i m looking at you are outraged almost to the point of stark raving incoherence _meta_end_dot_

 and now all of the commentary is raging what does hillary want _meta_end_question_

 it seems obvious she wants power _meta_end_dot_

 either she is hoping that somehow someway some sort of scandal will come up that will sink barack obama even after he has clinched the nomination for the democratic party or she is positioning for the vice presidential nomination _meta_end_dot_

 and she thinks that she has enough leverage to force barack obama to pay attention to her and to perhaps make some sort of concession to her that will make her happy and leave her satisfied that politically she has gained more than she may have lost _meta_end_dot_

 in any event while the nomination fight has ended the democratic party s hostage crisis continues and there is a very real danger that hillary clinton will yet be able to make barack obama weak enough to lose in the fall thus opening the way for the clintons to run again in four years _meta_end_dot_

 a memo to the mccain campaign if you want your candidate to steal barack obama s thunder that s fine _meta_end_dot_

 try having him give a good speech that doesn t involve him smiling broadly out of context over and over and over and over and over again _meta_end_dot_

 that may involve having mccain in a town hall forum where he is at his best instead of having him give a formal speech where he is reading text and being stiff and uncomfortable _meta_end_dot_

 whatever the winning formulation is find it _meta_end_dot_

 tonight s speech was awful _meta_end_dot_

 finally and this has to be written congratulations to barack obama _meta_end_dot_

 i disagree with him strongly on the issues and there is absolutely no doubt whatsoever that i will vote for john mccain in the fall _meta_end_dot_

 but credit where it is due his attainment of the nomination shows that we have come a very very long way as a country closer to the point martin luther king dreamed of a point when we can judge people not by the color of their skin but by the content of their character _meta_end_dot_

 for everyone who hoped that we would at long last begin to get over and beyond the mindlessness of racial prejudice tonight was a very special night indeed no matter who you end up voting for in the fall _meta_end_dot_
