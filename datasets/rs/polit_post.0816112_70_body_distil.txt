  as i write this morning the price of crude oil is below _meta_dollor_ref_ barrel down from its historic near _meta_percent_ref_ surge on friday to an intraday high over _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 and south korea is the latest government to announce policy measures to contain the impact of high crude prices on its local economy _meta_end_dot_

 china has been slowly increasing its controlled prices for key fuels like diesel _meta_end_dot_

 in china the large oil companies are mostly state owned and the government has been forcing them to eat the difference between the high crude price and what the people would prefer to pay for fuel _meta_end_dot_

 it s maxine waters fondest dream other countries have announced that they would abandon price controls _meta_end_dot_

 reminds me of when the bank of england under sustained attack from george soros and other currency speculators about _meta_number_ref_ years ago threw in the towel and announced that they would no longer defend the pound sterling keep reading _meta_end_dot_

 the european central bank s governor jean claude trichet hinted broadly last thursday that policy euro interest rates were more likely to rise than to fall setting off a huge spike of dollar selling and crude oil buying _meta_end_dot_

 the dollar is a bit lower against the euro this morning and south korea s news was a big spike of fiscal spending designed to stimulate through inflation the country s economy which is showing signs of distress in part because high oil prices mean less spending on everything else _meta_end_dot_

 you may recall that a few weeks ago i predicted in this space that crude oil could spike to between _meta_dollor_ref_ and _meta_dollor_ref_ a barrel this year before falling back significantly _meta_end_dot_

 i m often asked where the price increases are coming from _meta_end_dot_

 many people feel sure there must be a simple reason why but there isn t _meta_end_dot_

 it s a combination of pressures some upward supply constraints financial speculation increased demand from asia and some downward softening of demand in the developed countries _meta_end_dot_

 policy makers around the world have begun to take seriously the possibility that high crude oil prices could lead to a global slowdown or even a recession _meta_end_dot_

 and of course as our politicians are very well aware there s a strong expectation that government needs to do something about the problem but because the causes are large complex and global there s essentially nothing that the government can do to solve the problem which to most people means reducing the price they pay for gasoline _meta_end_dot_

 nothing that is that wouldn t have powerful negative effects elsewhere _meta_end_dot_

 the price of crude oil is simply what it is and it will be what it will be and that means that everything made with crude oil will be more expensive _meta_end_dot_

 and people and businesses will adjust their behavior accordingly _meta_end_dot_

 this will happen rapidly and more or less smoothly _meta_end_dot_

 but and this is why i m writing to you this morning the effects of these adjustments will not be symmetrical across different countries especially as it relates to recessionary pressure _meta_end_dot_

 many people will tell you that the us is the most profligate user of energy on the planet and if only we stopped using so darn much of it the grass would get greener the girls would get prettier and life would just be all around better _meta_end_dot_

 if you compare simple energy intensity the amount of energy used per unit of gdp the large economies are bunched together fairly close _meta_end_dot_

 the us isn t the most or the least energy intensive _meta_end_dot_

 but that s if you look at total energy use by the whole society _meta_end_dot_

 if you look at industrial production only the us is considerably more energy efficient than other large economies _meta_end_dot_

 we use less energy to produce a unit of economic output than other countries do _meta_end_dot_

 what s the difference _meta_end_question_

 we drive much longer distances in our cars than people in other countries _meta_end_dot_

 in fact per capita consumption of motor transport by americans and canadians is perhaps two or more times as high as in other large countries _meta_end_dot_

 and in the us petroleum is used primarily for motor transport _meta_end_dot_

 the us economy is led by consumer spending _meta_end_dot_

 almost every other large economy is driven more by industrial production for export and less by consumer demand than ours is _meta_end_dot_

 to put it crudely that means that the pain from higher crude oil prices is felt by americans as pressure to drive less _meta_end_dot_

 but in countries like south korea and japan it s also felt as pressure to produce less _meta_end_dot_

 therefore the us will feel less of a recessionary influence from expensive crude oil than other countries will _meta_end_dot_

 jobs are less at risk here than elsewhere _meta_end_dot_

 and if expensive gasoline turns out to be a permanent reality i m not among the people who take this on faith we ll make the adjustments with or without interference from washington _meta_end_dot_

 it will just mean that we ll drive fewer miles in lighter vehicles and this is an adjustment people will make readily _meta_end_dot_

 they ll grumble of course but none of the other predicted effects including alternative fuels hybrid engines nuclear powered electric cars or increased use of public transport will happen anytime soon _meta_end_dot_

 and to the extent that they happen at all government can only hinder them not help them along _meta_end_dot_
