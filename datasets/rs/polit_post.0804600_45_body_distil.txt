  an association of restaurant operators in san francisco has asked the u s _meta_end_dot_

 supreme court to overrule a decision by the ninth u s _meta_end_dot_

 circuit court of appeals allowing the city s health insurance employer mandate law to go into effect _meta_end_dot_

 it will be best for all of san francisco if the court sides with the association on this one _meta_end_dot_

 the association is seeking reinstatement of a federal judge s ruling that the city s health care security ordinance conflicts with the employee retirement income security act erisa a longstanding federal law addressing government regulation of employee benefits _meta_end_dot_

 on december _meta_number_ref_ u s _meta_end_dot_

 district judge jeffrey white ruled the ordinance violates erisa _meta_end_dot_

 white s ruling temporarily halted implementation of a mandate scheduled to go into effect on new year s day that would have required employers to offer their employees health coverage or pay to support healthy san francisco the city s health care program _meta_end_dot_

 on january _meta_number_ref_ a three judge panel from the ninth circuit stayed white s ruling pending a full review of the case and san francisco s pay or play mandate was allowed to go into effect _meta_end_dot_

 healthy san francisco requires every business in the city with between _meta_number_ref_ and _meta_number_ref_ workers to spend _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ per employee per hour for health care benefits and those with more than _meta_number_ref_ employees to spend _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ per hour either on their own plan or in payments to the city _meta_end_dot_

 until the end of _meta_number_ref_ the program catered exclusively to individuals whose income was at or below the poverty line _meta_end_dot_

 in his quest to make san franciscans health care solely the purview of the government mayor gavin newsom is seeking to use the revenue generated by the mandate to expand healthy san francisco incrementally until it includes all of the city s _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ uninsured residents _meta_end_dot_

 the program is designed to make switching from private insurance to taxpayer funded health care a viable option for those who already have coverage _meta_end_dot_

 while ensuring affordable health care for all san franciscans is a laudable goal expanding government control and forcibly taking money from businesses to fund a one size fits all government program is the wrong way to go about it _meta_end_dot_

 newsom s healthy san francisco expansion will harm both individual san franciscans health care and the city s economy _meta_end_dot_

 businesses would have to recoup the money they were forced to spend on health insurance as a result of this mandate by cutting wages laying off employees raising prices on goods and services or forestalling needed investments and dividend payouts _meta_end_dot_

 businesses do not have endless supplies of capital after all so they have to compensate for money lost in any one area by making or saving money in another _meta_end_dot_

 preferring to avoid the hardships associated with increased payroll and tax costs many businesses based in the city may simply decide enough is enough and relocate to places that don t subject them to laws regulating their employees benefits and forcibly take resources from them if they do not comply _meta_end_dot_

 another problem with the program is that other players in the health insurance market will be pushed out by the government run alternative the one program backed by a guaranteed funding source since government is the only organization that can legally force others to contribute _meta_end_dot_

 this will stifle innovation and quality in health coverage because with no serious competitors in the marketplace and a legally guaranteed source of funding the government monopoly will have no reason to innovate or improve it can t lose customers unless they take the big step of leaving the city _meta_end_dot_

 this situation is being watched closely by city and state governments across the nation _meta_end_dot_

 if the supreme court refuses to take up the case or decides san francisco can indeed require employers to offer health benefits or be forced to pay stiff penalties copycat programs could sweep across the nation in a very short period of time destroying health care markets everywhere _meta_end_dot_

 this would be catastrophic for state and local economies and would cause even more problems for america s health care system by replacing what s left of the market system with a patchwork of government regulated and controlled programs that stifle innovation and reduce the quality of care _meta_end_dot_

 a win for healthy san francisco could lead to a very unhealthy nation _meta_end_dot_
