  evidently there is a campaign focused on taking tiny little snippets of statements john mccain has made and making mccain look utterly cruel and heartless as a result of those snippets _meta_end_dot_

 this game must be amusing for about five minutes seven tops but after a while one wonders what is to be gained by it _meta_end_dot_

 other than misleading the electorate of course _meta_end_dot_

 the latest would be kerfuffle involves democrats howling over mccain supposedly saying that it s not too important when american troops come home from iraq _meta_end_dot_

 problem is that these charges utterly and completely misses the context of the mccain statement bizarrely and offensively however the obama campaign and its surrogates have decided to try to portray mccain as not caring about the welfare of the troops _meta_end_dot_

 this is both entirely inaccurate when one considers the context of the mccain statements and entirely offensive when one considers mccain s wartime heroism and the fact that his life experience alone has caused him to care more about the state of the military and the welfare of the troops than most of his peers in public service _meta_end_dot_

 war heroes deserve if nothing else the benefit of the doubt on these kinds of issues and mccain s public life has made clear that he takes a backseat to no one in his concern for the troops _meta_end_dot_

 so much for this new tone i keep hearing about _meta_end_dot_

 and in a just world when people think that the only way they can win a presidential election is by deliberately misconstruing john mccain s statements it should say more about mccain s would be critics than it does about him _meta_end_dot_

 the actual facts surrounding mccain s comment are crystal clear even if their portrayal by the obama campaign and its surrogates is not _meta_end_dot_
