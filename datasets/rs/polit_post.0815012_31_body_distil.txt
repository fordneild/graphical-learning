 when some organizers for the primary campaign of barak obama in oregon dropped several rented porta potties in the middle of a memorial for fallen police officers they made a statement _meta_end_dot_

 they deny this to the hilt but i am convinced just as vehemently that these porta potties didn t get put where they were put as a result of unfortunate random number generation _meta_end_dot_

 barak obama s political movement discourages deep and profound respect for decency patriotism and all accepted social norms _meta_end_dot_

 if this porta potty incident were to have happened to democratic congressman skelton of missouri who has been on the house armed services committee for as long as i ve been alive it would be asynchronous _meta_end_dot_

 thus probably not the deliberate smuttiness that it truly was coming from the likes of barak obama _meta_end_dot_

 given that it happened in the campaign of the guy whose campaign staff in texas had the giant che guevara banner on their wall it becomes part of a trend _meta_end_dot_

 this trend should not surprise anyone who remembers his stated views on why he stopped wearing a us flag pin on his lapel _meta_end_dot_

 the truth is that right after _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ i had a pin obama said _meta_end_dot_

 shortly after _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ particularly because as we re talking about the iraq war that became a substitute for i think true patriotism which is speaking out on issues that are of importance to our national security _meta_end_dot_

 i decided i won t wear that pin on my chest he said in the interview _meta_end_dot_

 instead i m going to try to tell the american people what i believe will make this country great and hopefully that will be a testament to my patriotism on thursday his campaign issued a statement we all revere the flag but senator obama believes that being a patriot is about more than a symbol _meta_end_dot_

 it s about fighting for our veterans when they get home and speaking honestly with the american people about this disastrous war ap _meta_number_ref_ oct _meta_number_ref_ none of this makes barak obama a guy who personally agrees with che guevara about america _meta_end_dot_

 che expounds on how he feels about flag pin wearing yankee hyenas below _meta_end_dot_

 the solutions to the world s problems lie behind the iron curtain stressed ernesto che guevara who often signed his correspondence with the moniker stalin ii if the nuclear missiles had remained we would have fired them against the heart of the u s _meta_end_dot_

 including new york city he boasted _meta_end_dot_

 the victory of socialism is well worth millions of atomic victims however the che guevara flag and the deliberate desecration of the police memorial are what the american people can expect from a barack obama led organization for two reasons _meta_end_dot_

 obama gave the impression that symbols of the united states were not important to him personally _meta_end_dot_

 also he did nothing to discourage the deliberate disrespect for these symbols when his supporters engaged in it with the press cameras rolling _meta_end_dot_

 this has attracted a large number of people to barak obama s campaign and political movement who genuinely dislike the united states of america but who do not wish to give up any of the benefits that accrue to them from living here _meta_end_dot_

 the deliberate refusal to wear the flag pin the che guevara flags and the porta potties deliberately dropped on the memorial to fallen police officers are forms of symbolic speech _meta_end_dot_

 they offer barak obama and his supporters a symbolic way to say the following _meta_end_dot_

 i love the nice toys and fancy lifestyle i get from being an american instead of a ugandan but i profoundly disrespect all of the stupid yokels that i actually have to share these items with i fully expect the police officers in oregon and in every other state to stand there and take a bullet for me when i am in danger _meta_end_dot_

 however they had better not enforce any laws that i choose to violate because i am better than any of them as a human being this is the true meaning of barak obama s refusal to wear the american flag pin _meta_end_dot_

 this is what the che guevara banner hanging in barak obama campaign headquarters truly represents _meta_end_dot_

 average middle class americans and everything that we cling to are what barak obama supporters dump their crap upon when they park their porta potties on a memorial to fallen police officers in the great state of oregon _meta_end_dot_

 this is another vital reason why barak obama should never be nominated for or elected to the office of us president _meta_end_dot_
