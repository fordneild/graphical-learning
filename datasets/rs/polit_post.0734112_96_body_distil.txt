  the bureau of labor statistics have released their monthly snapshot of employment conditions for november and it surprised on the upside _meta_end_dot_

 expectations were for the economy to have added _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ new jobs last month but the number came in at _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 the bond market is selling off on this news with the short end of the yield curve down slightly and the middle and long end up considerably _meta_end_dot_

 the _meta_number_ref_ year note has now fallen to yield nearly _meta_number_ref_ _meta_percent_ref_ as opposed to an incredibly strong _meta_number_ref_ _meta_percent_ref_ several days ago _meta_end_dot_

 more analysis below the fold _meta_end_dot_

 what the bond markets are saying is that unexpectedly strong performance in the economy during the financial and housing crises is reducing expectations for further interest rate cuts from the federal reserve _meta_end_dot_

 this sentiment is echoed in the recent rally in the dollar against the euro _meta_end_dot_

 the greenback has rallied above parity against the loonie after canadian officials cut interest rates the other day _meta_end_dot_

 the dollar s recent strength against the yen reflects increased risk tolerance in carry trades which is positive but volatile from day to day as we have come to expect the bls statistics show that jobs continue to be lost at very high rates in the goods producing manufacturing and construction sectors _meta_end_dot_

 the job growth in services retail education and government more than made up for these losses _meta_end_dot_

 to an ever increasing degree americans no longer make or build things _meta_end_dot_

 instead they perform services for each other and work for the government _meta_end_dot_

 there is one element in the labor report that may be taken with a wary eye wages growth was strong in november _meta_end_dot_

 the federal reserve spends a great deal of its time worrying about inflation _meta_end_dot_

 any significant amount of inflation in the economy basically eliminates lower interest rates as a policy tool _meta_end_dot_

 this matters because a great deal of the recent optimism in the stock markets is predicated on further cuts in rates by the fed _meta_end_dot_

 in the fed s view of the world food and energy price inflation don t really matter all that much _meta_end_dot_

 what they care a very great deal about however in addition to core consumer prices is wages _meta_end_dot_

 because if wages grow businesses may find that they are able to pass higher labor costs along to consumers in the form of higher prices _meta_end_dot_

 that s the kind of inflation that can get out of control _meta_end_dot_

 other recent reports show that consumer confidence is at cyclical lows _meta_end_dot_

 this measurement is important because it s theoretically a leading indicator of future spending even though it probably measures news bias more than anything else _meta_end_dot_

 and obviously the news bias has been overwhelmingly negative for the economy _meta_end_dot_

 if consumers are facing distress from the strong drop in the value of their homes which continues uninterrupted they re not showing any signs of it _meta_end_dot_

 as mbecker and others have pointed out and as my own private conversations indicate a lot more shoes will drop as adjustable alt a mortgages start to reset over the next year and beyond _meta_end_dot_

 i m not inclined to the prevailing view that housing weakness will badly hurt consumer spending _meta_end_dot_

 we have yet to see any evidence of that _meta_end_dot_

 it may just be too early to tell and perhaps the holiday retail season is masking the effect _meta_end_dot_

 i continue to see daily evidence of exceptionally strong growth in the global economy outside of the us and europe _meta_end_dot_

 to repeat what i ve said in prior posts i strongly expect that export growth will lead the us economy for years to come _meta_end_dot_
