  i m embarrassed it took me so long writes myron magnet to grasp the phoniness of the charge that it s anti immigration to oppose current u s _meta_end_dot_

 immigration policy and the even worse comprehensive reform bill which thankfully failed this confession appears subscription required in the current number of the american spectator that fine magazine s _meta_number_ref_th anniversary issue _meta_end_dot_

 he goes on to restate with clarity simplicity and deftly marshaled evidential support the enforcement by attrition approach to the immigration crisis in america _meta_end_dot_

 we need no comprehensive legislative reform _meta_end_dot_

 we need steady enforcement of current law against both illegals and their abettors in business government and elsewhere _meta_end_dot_

 we need to be disabused of some stale clich s and sophistries beginning with the one about the net benefit of mass immigration _meta_end_dot_

 our immigration policy must rest unequivocally on american national interest _meta_end_dot_

 mr _meta_end_dot_

 magnet is the former editor of the highly respected new york based city journal _meta_end_dot_

 his arguments will not fall on deaf ears _meta_end_dot_

 this is after all the journal that was the intellectual muscle behind the astonishing transformation of new york city which was one of the signal achievements of the last fifteen years in american political science and which is the most solid pillar of accomplishment supporting the presidential campaign of rudy giuliani _meta_end_dot_

 for city journal to throw in with the immigration skeptics is an indication of how far we ve come from the heady days when platitude was king _meta_end_dot_
