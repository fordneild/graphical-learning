  in one of the more shockingly presumptuous acts i have ever witnessed in presidential politics a non incumbent candidate for the presidency of the united states has actually taken the time to design a seal for himself that resembles the great seal of the united states and the seal of the president of the united states _meta_end_dot_

 consider me officially gobsmacked _meta_end_dot_

 bear in mind that all of this means a someone proposed this idea to the top levels of the obama campaign b the top levels of the obama campaign agreed that it was a good idea c the candidate himself may have had a hand in designing and tweaking the logo d someone with a knowledge of latin was sought out in order to translate yes we can into the language of the caesars repeat that last bit to yourself a time or two to grasp the full significance of how important this matter apparently was to the obama campaign and e there was no one in the campaign who perhaps nervously cleared his or her throat and piped up with the words um _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 folks given all of our concerns about the imperial presidency as articulated during the bush cheney administration doesn t anyone else think that it might be _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 er _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 well _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 a little hypocritical for us to be doing this kind of thing what barack obama could learn from king canute has already been noted but not only has the obama campaign refused to take note of canute s modesty they have transcended their earlier acts of grandiosity the waters are really going to stop rising because barack obama won the democratic presidential nomination _meta_end_question_

 with an act that reveals just how much the obama campaign resembles a cult of personality _meta_end_dot_

 what are we going to have next _meta_end_question_

 a revival of richard nixon s idea to make white house guards look like beefeaters and _meta_number_ref_th century prussians _meta_end_question_

 via e mail redstate colleague dan mclaughlin suggests that perhaps obama will now move to commission a campaign version of hail to the chief that can be used at events until the election after which barack obama can presumably prepare himself to hear the real thing _meta_end_dot_

 of course i m not sure that a new interim tune needs to be written at least not while this song exists or is this little ditty not exultant and obsequious enough _meta_end_question_

 relatedly john mccormack notes that technically the davids axelrod and plouffe may be risking a stiff fine or a prison sentence _meta_end_dot_

 of course this will never happen but i can easily find that the obama campaign has reproduce d a likeness of the seals of the president or vice president or any substantial part thereof for a purpose not pertaining to the official use of the government of the united states maybe axelrod and plouffe want to approach their candidate and ask him ever so offhandedly of course whether his legal skills are rusty _meta_end_dot_

 just in case _meta_end_dot_
