  the question on all lips in this week s edition of the political fights is should the federal government apply a keynesian stimulus to the us economy in order to forestall a recession _meta_end_question_

 you ve read no end of answers this week here on redstate and other places _meta_end_dot_

 i m even guilty of stirring the pot myself _meta_end_dot_

 i happen not to believe that the kinds of packages being discussed fast acting targeted at the hardest hit will necessarily do anything to improve conditions in the near term and certainly not in the long term _meta_end_dot_

 but what are the financial markets telling us about the outlook this gloomy friday morning here in new york _meta_end_question_

 they re telling us they re scared _meta_end_dot_

 read on _meta_end_dot_

 what is keynesian stimulus anyway _meta_end_question_

 well to oversimplify it comes from the theory that the business cycle arises from the natural ebb and flow of demand for goods and services _meta_end_dot_

 there s a lag time between the appearance and the fulfillment of demand and business tends to overshoot when bringing on new industrial capacity _meta_end_dot_

 that all means that capacity is not perfectly matched to demand and there are boom times when demand for labor is plentiful and bust times when lots of people tend to lose their jobs _meta_end_dot_

 in theory then you can smooth out the cycle by borrowing extra money and just consuming it during the lean times _meta_end_dot_

 that s what a stimulus package is all about _meta_end_dot_

 in my critique of hillary clinton s stimulus proposal i explained why this approach won t likely do much good this time around _meta_end_dot_

 in short the keynesian perspective doesn t model the modern global economy particularly well _meta_end_dot_

 people constantly ask me about the economic outlook _meta_end_dot_

 will we have a recession or are we already in one _meta_end_question_

 how bad will it get _meta_end_question_

 the only honest answer i can give is i don t know _meta_end_dot_

 i can speculate and i am speculating but it s neither fair nor smart to do that in public but one of our cherished free market dogmas is that markets discount all available information and the markets are just as confused as anyone these days _meta_end_dot_

 let s take a peek at what they re trying to say _meta_end_dot_

 us stock markets that s the headline and it s been consistent _meta_end_dot_

 they re at a _meta_number_ref_ month low down a good _meta_percent_ref_ in less than two weeks _meta_end_dot_

 that s a frighteningly fast decline _meta_end_dot_

 it means the broad outlook for corporate profits is perceived to be weak _meta_end_dot_

 and yet most of the damage is confined to a few sectors _meta_end_dot_

 corporate earnings are actually not all that bad except for companies in the financial and housing sectors _meta_end_dot_

 that suggests that as expected the current slowdown whether or not it s a recession won t result in widespread job losses _meta_end_dot_

 that s also an argument not to apply keynesian stimulus _meta_end_dot_

 i won t try to predict the course of the stock market _meta_end_dot_

 much will depend on what the federal reserve does with monetary policy _meta_end_dot_

 not much will depend on whether the congress and the administration choose to stimulate _meta_end_dot_

 even more will depend on the perception of better growth opportunities in other asset classes _meta_end_dot_

 at some point many us stocks will be priced well below their long term value _meta_end_dot_

 we may be at that point now but i m not going to say that for sure _meta_end_dot_

 interest rates this is a very major story which has been overshadowed by the action in stocks _meta_end_dot_

 the _meta_number_ref_ year us treasury rate is now at _meta_number_ref_ _meta_percent_ref_ incredibly low _meta_end_dot_

 it feels like i ve been calling this rate incredibly low for nearly a year now since it was around _meta_number_ref_ _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 that tells you that global investors have increased their desire to lend money to the us government _meta_end_dot_

 it means that on a risk adjusted basis there is a shortage of good investment opportunities in turn portending lower growth overall _meta_end_dot_

 it also tells you that fears of inflation are slim to none _meta_end_dot_

 now you re entirely free to believe otherwise and many fiscal conservatives do particularly when presenting the case against deficit spending _meta_end_dot_

 my heart is with you fiscal conservatives right down the line _meta_end_dot_

 my head looks at the numbers and says otherwise _meta_end_dot_

 as long as money is so darned cheap we should be borrowing barrels and barrels of it and cutting taxes just as much or more _meta_end_dot_

 and i ll reverse my position on this issue the very nanosecond that long term rates start going up _meta_end_dot_

 all right blackhedd you smarty pants _meta_end_dot_

 it s one thing to lend to the government _meta_end_dot_

 that s just risk averse behavior _meta_end_dot_

 what about business lending look at near term libor _meta_end_dot_

 everyone s panties have been in a knot in recent months as the libor spread over benchmark risk free rates has hovered near _meta_number_ref_ basis points indicating a severe credit crunch _meta_end_dot_

 libor has fallen nearly _meta_number_ref_ bps in the last month _meta_end_dot_

 the credit crunch is easing _meta_end_dot_

 this is probably due to very aggressive countermeasures by the european central bank _meta_end_dot_

 it s also possibly a faint signal that we ve turned the corner on mortgage asset related losses _meta_end_dot_

 you heard it here first _meta_end_dot_

 commodities crude oil is down more than _meta_percent_ref_ in less than two weeks _meta_end_dot_

 we saw exactly the same thing happen a year ago january _meta_end_dot_

 i don t have the data to tell you whether the saudis quietly increased production back in november as they obliquely hinted they would _meta_end_dot_

 it takes five weeks or so including a _meta_number_ref_ day ocean voyage in tankers for such moves to impact world prices the news stories are saying that crude prices are falling because the expectation of a weaker us economy will reduce demand _meta_end_dot_

 i think there s a lot of convincing evidence that high prices have curbed demand for gasoline somewhat less for distillates diesel heating oil jet fuel _meta_end_dot_

 but crude oil is different _meta_end_dot_

 as you ve heard me say oil is used by speculators as a hedge against dollar weakness _meta_end_dot_

 i believe the crude price on any given day inversely correlates pretty well with sentiment on the dollar _meta_end_dot_

 and the dollar has weakened against the yen and the chinese yuan and strengthened against the euro _meta_end_dot_

 what does all that mean _meta_end_question_

 the yen action is volatile since it tracks daily carry trade activity and so is largely sentiment driven _meta_end_dot_

 the euro is falling because of expectations that the ecb will throw in the towel and start cutting rates _meta_end_dot_

 the yuan is rising because the chinese have finally managed to start slowing down their economy _meta_end_dot_

 agriculture prices for corn and wheat continue very very strong _meta_end_dot_

 day to day they depend on the weather reports _meta_end_dot_

 longer term they respond to anticipated demand from the developing world _meta_end_dot_

 corn is a crop that produces relatively high financial yields in the us compared to the other big crops like several kinds of wheat soy and sorghum _meta_end_dot_

 corn acreage will grow _meta_end_dot_

 but not in response to demand for ethanol production which is likely to fall in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 why _meta_end_question_

 simple _meta_end_dot_

 ethanol is used primarily as motor fuel a market in which demand is softening _meta_end_dot_

 so that s the roundup _meta_end_dot_

 you ll note the extremely rapid changes in much of what i ve discussed _meta_end_dot_

 that speaks to the unsettled and uncertain nature of the global economic outlook _meta_end_dot_

 all of this analysis could be right out the window before the end of the day _meta_end_dot_

 do you still think stimulating the economy is a good idea _meta_end_question_

 almost certainly has very deep systematic flaws _meta_end_dot_
