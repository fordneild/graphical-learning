  if you follow my posts here at redstate you know that i was among the first to compare the current economic situation to the great depression in its genesis and dynamics not necessarily in its severity and also to predict a long stubborn economic funk _meta_end_dot_

 now that many if not most mainstream commentators on the economy basically agree with me it s time to turn contrarian again and take another look into the crystal ball _meta_end_dot_

 given that all kinds of armageddon scenarios have now been baked into financial asset and commodity prices it s not a bad time to ask whether something less bad than the worst case will actually occur _meta_end_dot_

 more _meta_end_dot_

 we are still in the jaws of a very serious crunch in which traditional sources of credit have become extraordinarily risk averse to the point of disrupting not only financial markets but also the real world economy of jobs goods and services _meta_end_dot_

 and this is a global phenomenon not restricted to the united states _meta_end_dot_

 the overnight money markets which are the basement engine room of the global economy are showing significant signs of stabilizing in the us thanks to constant and aggressive interventions by the new york federal reserve bank _meta_end_dot_

 in europe overnight repo is still very sclerotic but not quite as bad as it s been _meta_end_dot_

 bond markets are slowly limping back to near normalcy with corporate bond issuance exceptionally well received in recent weeks albeit at abnormally high spreads to risk free credit _meta_end_dot_

 there is now significant upside risk in the stock markets as the perception takes hold among equity investors that it might finally be safe to come out and play _meta_end_dot_

 that s not a general recommendation to buy stocks by the way because the downside risk remains as strong as ever but non financial business corporations are a widely overlooked bright spot in the general financial picture _meta_end_dot_

 large public companies have been hoarding cash and avoiding leverage _meta_end_dot_

 i think this is at least partly because of the relative lack of good opportunities so it s not an unmixed blessing _meta_end_dot_

 but the result is that corporate balance sheets are unusually strong _meta_end_dot_

 this gives them the ability to weather a period of economic weakness without major job cuts _meta_end_dot_

 that s very good news _meta_end_dot_

 to me it s a forgone conclusion that the world of finance will not return to the conditions that prevailed over the last ten years or so _meta_end_dot_

 too much has happened to discredit the risk management procedures everyone has been using _meta_end_dot_

 the ultimate solution to the credit crisis will not come from a return to recent normalcy but from structural changes that are not yet clear _meta_end_dot_

 but a solution will come _meta_end_dot_

 the us consumer is another matter altogether _meta_end_dot_

 economic weakness translating to fears about job security combined with inflation is causing consumers to pull in their horns and this is can very well become the proximate cause of a protracted recession _meta_end_dot_

 if you really don t like the r word then let me just say that we could be in for a long period possibly stretching into years of slow growth with continued anxiety about jobs a higher saving rate not necessarily a good thing and less consumption _meta_end_dot_

 and what s the real wild card _meta_end_question_

 the housing market _meta_end_dot_

 at this point in time there still is no sense for where the floor is _meta_end_dot_

 as i ve written before the financial world is in a maelstrom of deleveraging and the worse case scenarios here are extremely bad _meta_end_dot_

 unfortunately here there s not yet any visible reason for optimism _meta_end_dot_

 the big question is what is the true value of all the mortgage based debt out there _meta_end_question_

 if traditional leveraged sources of mortgage financing don t come back into the game then the debt will deflate and the only lenders available will be real money non leveraged lenders _meta_end_dot_

 no one knows where the equilibrium point in the mortgage finance market is _meta_end_dot_

 if it truly turns out to be way down at a non leveraged level then we will replay the great depression with something resembling its length and severity adjusting for a wide range of mitigating factors that didn t exist in the thirties _meta_end_dot_

 i really can t tell you how likely that outcome is _meta_end_dot_

 we ve said a great deal these past few weeks about the valor of the federal reserve in combating the proximate credit crises but not much about what can be done to stabilize the housing market _meta_end_dot_

 congress of course is working overtime on the problem _meta_end_dot_

 the systemic risk at this moment is extraordinarily high ladies and gentlemen because the cost of a federal bailout will be huge _meta_end_dot_

 forget about the moral hazard _meta_end_dot_

 even if it works perfectly it will constitute a government takeover of the economy rivaling the new deal in its reach and in the damage it will ultimately do to your freedom _meta_end_dot_

 but if congress does nothing the housing market will find its own equilibrium by market forces _meta_end_dot_

 and that equilibrium could be anything from quite near normal _meta_number_ref_ levels to someplace far far lower _meta_end_dot_

 scylla and charybdis _meta_end_dot_
