  cy did a great job with this story here _meta_end_dot_

 i have just the following to add barack obama is quite simply doing at least one of three things here and with credit to lileks i fully expect the left to shut up and reverently honor my acting out of the highest form of patriotism with regard to mr _meta_end_dot_

 obama and dissenting against him _meta_number_ref_ he is lying his armanigucci pants off on purpose _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ he is blowing smoke out his fourth point of contact just to be able to appease his base more _meta_number_ref_ he is so mind blowingly ignorant of the military and its status in the gwot that he either heard this story and believed it or thought that nobody less mind numbingly vacuous and stupid than him would see through it _meta_end_dot_

 though these options are not mutually exclusive the two parts of option _meta_number_ref_ are the least exclusive of all _meta_end_dot_

 the spinning after the fact makes all the difference in the world to this story too _meta_end_dot_

 obama originally said the former obama s original so stupid and false that it s almost impossible to respond to story is absolutely ridiculous and is in keeping with the options listed above either a bold faced lie a made up story that the teller didn t expected to be called on and given that the left s knowledge of the different types and uses of cannabis typically tends to be vastly superior to its knowledge of anything military or warfare related why would he ever expect to be questioned or caught or and this likely goes along with the above two options a sign of a frightening level of military ignorance on the part of a common citizen let alone on the part of a sitting united states senator _meta_end_dot_

 the second version _meta_end_question_

 believable for some obvious reasons _meta_end_dot_

 see this picture _meta_end_question_

 that s me as a journalist not as an operator firing an ak _meta_number_ref_ on the shooting range at patrol base olson in samarra iraq _meta_end_dot_

 the ak _meta_number_ref_ is one of several in the company arms room there _meta_end_dot_

 they are not taken out on missions or if they ever are it is because a replacement part is needed in a pinch and a resupply convoy might not be scheduled to come until later that day or perhaps the next but are novelty cool guy weapons taken as the spoils of battle which are cleaned and taken care of by the company s soldiers and are fired for fun familiarity and proficiency on the patrol base firing range _meta_end_dot_

 this is a normal activity for combat units _meta_end_dot_

 now can anybody here spot the difference between the obama debate story and the revised ap written one _meta_end_question_

 that s right the absolute crap made up to get attention show of unbelivable ignorance obamariginal story tells of those events in the context of president bush and secdef gates so underequipping soldiers that they have to go capture enemy weapons to fight no word on how they would do that if they aren t able to be armed themselves due to a lack of supplies guess we really do have a force of rambos in the conventional army the ap story makes clear that what this really was was units taking war trophies they had earned in combat and using them for various purposes outside of their official duties which they performed while using standard issue in stock plentifully supplied american weapons and occasionally using them as spot replacements for broken gear imagine that gear getting broken in war while awaiting a regularly scheduled resupply _meta_end_dot_

 the lying has gotten beyond ridiculous here _meta_end_dot_

 it s time for obama the messiah in waiting to stop breaking the _meta_number_ref_th commandment or to officially declare that in the religion for which he serves as godhead we can all disregard fact and truth in the name of spinning a good yarn _meta_end_dot_

 after all it s for the greater good and it s all about compromise _meta_end_dot_
