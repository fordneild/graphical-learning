  republicans should take note of this lesson relating to how you don t flood the internet with stuff bashing a candidate and then endorse that candidate _meta_end_dot_

 it tends to cause your supporters to think you don t really mean what you say this one put out by the tancredo campaign itself _meta_end_dot_

 and don t forget tancredo s question in the youtube debate _meta_end_dot_

 the word on the street is that a lot of tancredo s major supporters are after all of this scratching their heads _meta_end_dot_

 update so tancredo goes with romney and his staffers are going thompson _meta_end_dot_
