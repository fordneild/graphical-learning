  but issues concerning barack obama s recent comments just keep springing to mind _meta_end_dot_

 consider his side comment about anti immigrant sentiments that he attributes to people in small towns who get bitter now to be sure xenophobia certainly has been known to increase in tenor and pitch when hard economic times come about _meta_end_dot_

 but as i and others have argued if we are talking about the controversy surrounding our current immigration policies we have to acknowledge the fact that concerns regarding those policies do not merely exist because of hard economic times _meta_end_dot_

 immigration policy has always been a hot button issue _meta_end_dot_

 it was a hot button issue while the economic expansion was going on in full force during the bush presidency _meta_end_dot_

 it was a hot button issue when the reagan administration offered amnesty for illegal immigrants if only those immigrants declare themselves the economy was growing quite nicely then too and people felt very good about the direction of the country and their own personal fortunes _meta_end_dot_

 moreover as with the issue of trade obama shows a strange tendency to accuse others of sins he is primarily guilty of _meta_end_dot_

 he decries as most unfortunate the fact that the unwashed masses might become protectionists in hard economic times even as he opposes free trade in general and nafta and the u s colombia free trade agreement in particular _meta_end_dot_

 and when it comes to the issue of immigrants or more generally the other obama is more than willing to stoke resentments even as he pronounces the existence of those resentments as sorrowful and regrettable _meta_end_dot_

 remember this _meta_end_question_

 it contained the following passage or is it all right for barack obama to play on fears of the other even as he rightfully decries such fears when it comes to our attitudes towards immigrants _meta_end_question_
