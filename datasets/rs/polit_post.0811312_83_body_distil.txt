  the islamic society of north america isna the nation s largest association of muslim organizations joined by one of its increasingly natural allies the left wing blog thinkprogress is pressing john mccain to stop using the term radical islamic extremism to describe terrorist and terror sympathizing groups that are undeniably radical and extremist and justify that radical extremism with appeals to a radical and extreme reading of islam _meta_end_dot_

 or at least a reading that i assume is radical and extreme one would like to believe that groups like isna think so _meta_end_dot_

 naturally the united states wants and needs to convince the muslim world that this is the case and that the terrorists aren t right when they invoke islam to justify violence against non muslims and even very regularly against fellow muslims _meta_end_dot_

 but it s hard to make that argument if you don t even acknowledge the fact that the enemy is making such use of an ideology that purports to be grounded in islamic theology _meta_end_dot_

 how would you have gone about combatting the kkk without describing them as a racist group or international communism without arguing against communism _meta_end_question_

 isna s leader apparently wants to shut down precisely that sort of dialogue read on _meta_end_dot_

 the self proclaimed sophisticates at thinkprogress echo this line of reasoning the answer here is obvious we should stop referring to groups like al qaeda hezbollah literally the party of allah and hamas as islamic when they themselves stop doing so _meta_end_dot_

 but as long as they cite chapter and verse of the qu ran it is simply the truth to say that they are who they claim to be _meta_end_dot_

 and it s heartening to hear mccain spokesman steve schmidt stick to his guns meanwhile as the washington times notes mccain s democratic opponents are not so hot to wield the truth contrast the fire directed at mccain just for speaking the truth with sen _meta_end_dot_

 obama s er admirers among you guessed it radical islamist extremists _meta_end_dot_

 first up a senior official of hamas then we have the iranians more here on obama s collection of admirers who are not such big fans of the united states of america _meta_end_dot_

 even weighing the usual caveats here about the difficulty of getting information out of the iranian regime as well as the layer of blather time pastes over these quotes it should hardly surprise anyone that obama is more popular with the enemy when he declines to follow mccain s lead in calling them by their true name _meta_end_dot_
