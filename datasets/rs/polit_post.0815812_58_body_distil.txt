  the disaster originally known as cap and trade and now known as the boxer amendment has been stopped in the senate for now _meta_end_dot_

 a motion to invoke cloture on the boxer amdt _meta_end_dot_

 no _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ in the nature of a substitute has just been defeated _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ majority was not reached take that babs _meta_end_dot_

 here is the vote tally and i say to all the senators who voted against cloture good job folks well done but as i am always wont to do let us advertise the republicans that voted for cloture so they might be given a good scolding by their constituents before the bill actually gets to a vote which we know will happen sooner or later as an aside here are the r s not voting to the republicans and democrats that can t stomach sticking it to us little guys anymore _meta_end_question_
