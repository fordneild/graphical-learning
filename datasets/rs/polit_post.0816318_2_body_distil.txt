  poor poor barack _meta_end_dot_

 so many vicious rumors to discuss so few teleprompters available to tell him what to say about them _meta_end_dot_

 why is the internet so unfair _meta_end_question_

 well he s mad and he s not gonna take it anymore _meta_end_dot_

 steve foley at the minority report blog reports that barack obama is launching an internet war room to fight back _meta_end_dot_

 according to the times online a crack team of cybernauts will form a rapid response internet war room to track and respond aggressively to online rumours that barack obama is unpatriotic and a muslim just read this totally objective excerpt read on _meta_end_dot_

 what caused his poor showing with white blue collar voters versus hillary _meta_end_question_

 misplaced islamaphobia _meta_end_exclamation_

 also note how they equate he sympathises with palestinian radicals with his being sworn in on the koran _meta_end_dot_

 no need to look at his many radical associates _meta_end_exclamation_

 that s just a bunch of rumor mongering _meta_end_exclamation_

 we have a war room _meta_end_exclamation_

 to know know know him is to love love love him _meta_end_dot_

 why should barack be overly concerned with people not knowing him _meta_end_question_

 he seems perfectly comfortable with the fact that no one he knows is the person he knew _meta_end_dot_

 leaving aside the hilarious image produced by trying to imagine a bunch of obama bloggers as crack cybernauts boy are there some jokes in that the idea isn t a total loss _meta_end_dot_

 the left is notoriously successful at conjuring fact from rumor through the magic of repetition _meta_end_dot_

 so i m thinking why i m a crack cybernaut _meta_end_exclamation_

 why can t i do the same thing there are a lot of nasty rumors and memes that pass around the internet _meta_end_dot_

 sometimes these things make it into the real world _meta_end_dot_

 they spread they grow and they become knownfacts _meta_end_dot_

 one of the supreme deficiencies with the bush administration was their unwillingness or inability to combat such things _meta_end_dot_

 so i suggest we do so here at redstate _meta_end_dot_

 the blogs have shown the ability to fight it _meta_end_dot_

 the left pushed as hard as ever on the _meta_number_ref_ years of war flap but blogs and youtube pushed right back _meta_end_dot_

 the video is the proof but without people pushing back it would be common knowledge at this point that john mccain had advocated _meta_number_ref_ years of war _meta_end_dot_

 so when you see one of these nasty rumors about john mccain or any republican you can email me the link use my rs contact form _meta_end_dot_

 if you blog about them send me a link _meta_end_dot_

 i will either post immediately or save them up for a weekly wrapup _meta_end_dot_

 we can be our own crack team _meta_end_dot_

 i don t think i ll call it a war room though too hilarious _meta_end_dot_

 maybe _meta_end_dot_

 the rumor kill _meta_end_question_
