  update the author has since indicated that she was unaware of the nature of john mccain s torture she was merely mocking the man s appearance on general principles _meta_end_dot_

 the resulting apology is somewhere between a sorry you were offended and an actual apology which depressingly is better than usual i ll link to the article but there s no semantic content past the title the dental gap does john mccain have presidential teeth _meta_end_dot_

 as ed morrissey notes mccain s had dental problems _meta_end_dot_

 ever since north vietnamese torturers smashed his teeth out of his mouth _meta_end_dot_

 see here and here for details _meta_end_dot_

 now the minnesota monitor is an arm of soros funded the center for independent media as ed noted a while back and the number of the latter is _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 i fully expect them to be able to brazenly justify funding a media organization that mocks torture victims but it never hurts to check _meta_end_dot_

 by the way i had originally seen this story last night but had decided against putting this post up _meta_end_dot_

 and then i found out that priesmeyer is fully aware of the controversy but has apparently decided to neither correct nor update her commentary
