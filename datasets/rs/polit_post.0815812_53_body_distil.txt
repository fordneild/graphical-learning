  just last week obama finally decided to do what most people of sound judgment would have done much much sooner obama finally resigned as a member of the trinity united church of christ _meta_end_dot_

 now time magazine s steven gray reports reverend wright barack obama s former pastor and spiritual advisor of _meta_number_ref_ years refuses to relinquish his duties as senior pastor of trinity united church of christ greta van susteren discusses the issue with steven gray in the following video obama only expressed concern about his now former church after videos wright s hateful sermons were made available on the internet but obama refused to dissociate himself from wright or the church _meta_end_dot_

 only after wright s taunting speech and question and answer session at the national press club did obama see fit to denounce wright _meta_end_dot_

 like obama s audacious arrogance in refusing to get the facts about the success of the surge in iraq and his _meta_number_ref_ year association with the crook rezko obama s decision to continue his relationship with his radical church and reverend wright long after most people would have dissociated themselves from such blatant hateful preachings raises serious questions about obama s judgment _meta_end_dot_
