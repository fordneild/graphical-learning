  consider the following from larissa macfarquhar on barack obama differs from macfarquhar s _meta_end_dot_

 the concept of obama as a burkean is a popular one these days _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 at least in the world of punditry _meta_end_dot_

 much ink has been spilled and many pixels have been devoted to advancing this meme _meta_end_dot_

 it is a favorite of andrew sullivan s that link is but one example there are other examples to be found here though of course it should come as no surprise to find that andrew sullivan is working to redefine conservatism to mean stuff that andrew sullivan agrees with we will see a lot more of the obama as a burkean meme if as expected the junior senator from illinois becomes the nominee _meta_end_dot_

 but there is a fundamental flaw in the characterization _meta_end_dot_

 it is nice and good to say that obama distrusts abstractions generalizations extrapolations projections but aren t his speeches filled with just that _meta_end_question_

 oh sure he tells us that hope is not a whimsical thing or an expression of na vet _meta_end_dot_

 he tells us that he knows how hard it will be to effect his plans and policies _meta_end_dot_

 but apart from the standard fare from the liberal wing of the democratic party he really doesn t offer much in terms of specifics regarding those plans and policies now does he _meta_end_question_

 far from it _meta_end_dot_

 when one s ambition exceeds one s resume specifics are hard to come by after all _meta_end_dot_

 but that s no excuse for not demanding more from obama _meta_end_dot_

 we should tell him that if he really wants to be a burkean he ought to show that he can offer more than abstractions generalizations extrapolations projections words are pretty and senator obama s speeches are lovely _meta_end_dot_

 but they are not burkean _meta_end_dot_

 we ought to demand proof that obama thinks revolutions are unlikely he values continuity and stability for their own sake sometimes even more than he values change for the good we certainly don t get that impression from his speeches which promise a new american governing majority and which aim to impress the listener with obama s desire to create a transformation in society one that will be far more amenable to obama s theory of government than society currently is _meta_end_dot_

 transformative language is pretty and senator obama s speeches are lovely _meta_end_dot_

 but they are not burkean _meta_end_dot_

 and until some big development comes along to prove me wrong i am going to go out on a limb and proclaim that barack obama is no disciple of edmund burke _meta_end_dot_

 he has no obligation to be of course _meta_end_dot_

 he can be as transformative and paradigm changing as he wants to be _meta_end_dot_

 but he shouldn t camouflage his true stance by claiming or by standing idly by while acolytes and the media but i repeat myself claim that barack obama is a burkean _meta_end_dot_

 that argument does not pass the laugh test _meta_end_dot_

 and yes we all know why it is being tried so that obama can attract independents and republicans to his campaign _meta_end_dot_

 tactically one can understand this _meta_end_dot_

 philosophically one should have trouble accepting that this kind of project is on the level _meta_end_dot_

 to be sure when conservatives proclaim that they are burkeans they are dismissed as being old and stodgy _meta_end_dot_

 when liberals do it or have it done for them they are praised for being refreshingly realistic _meta_end_dot_

 this further helps explain why barack obama may have an interest in being viewed as a burkean _meta_end_dot_

 but again it shouldn t excuse this shoddy intellectual sales job or help hide all the reasons why no one even remotely familiar with burkean political philosophy ought to buy into the meme of obama as burke _meta_end_dot_
