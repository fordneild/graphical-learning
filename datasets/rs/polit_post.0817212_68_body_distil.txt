  an interesting development with one of the exonerated marines in the haditha mess jack murtha and time magazine s tim mcguirk created not so long ago has bubbled up the highest ranking officer accused is considering suing them as lawsuits go this is one i would thoroughly enjoy watching _meta_end_dot_

 i can think of no better example of giving back to the anti war democrats a little of that support we keep hearing so much about _meta_end_dot_

 all that distortion misrepresentation and shrill rhetoric comes at a real cost to the soldiers actually doing the heavy lifting for us in iraq and i would love to see them hold murtha and his ilk accountable for their actions and their words _meta_end_dot_

 the rest below the fold _meta_end_dot_

 i couldn t agree more _meta_end_dot_

 but where we are in this campaign is a democrat potus hopeful willing to give more rights to terrorists than any of the rights the haditha marines ever got _meta_end_dot_

 maybe one day soon obama might find himself in a courtroom having to explain himself to american soldiers just maybe _meta_end_dot_
