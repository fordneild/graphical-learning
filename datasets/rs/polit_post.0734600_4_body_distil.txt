  leave it to republicans to waste a golden opportunity to champion fiscal restraint _meta_end_dot_

 a day after house appropriations chairman david obey d wis scored points with conservatives for proposing to strip all earmarks from a mammoth omnibus spending bill senate republican leader mitch mcconnell rejected the idea outright _meta_end_dot_

 at at press conference today mcconnell outlined an alternative proposal that would combine _meta_dollor_ref_ billion in troop funding with an omnibus bill preserving an estimated _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ pork barrel projects _meta_end_dot_

 in an attempt to mask his plan as fiscally responsible mcconnell said it would include an across the board cut to bring the omnibus in line with president bush s top line budget number _meta_end_dot_

 just one week ago sen _meta_end_dot_

 jim demint warned us that this would happen sen _meta_end_dot_

 trent lott made sure reporters knew that republicans had no intention of cutting the fat earmarks are justified and legitimate _meta_end_dot_

 but they do need to pass the smell test _meta_end_dot_

 i wouldn t give up my earmarks conservatives on capitol hill and throughout washington view mcconnell s proposal as yet another indication that republican still don t get it when it comes to fiscal responsibility _meta_end_dot_

 senate gopers will be the ones to bring back the earmarks that obey is trying to eliminate one staffer said _meta_end_dot_

 sickening the club for growth put it this way it is a shame to see the highest ranking republicans in the senate move to the left of the democrats on earmarks _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 senators mcconnell and lott s support for pork projects in the omnibus is a sad statement about the priorities of the republican leadership in the senate of course it shouldn t be all that surprising _meta_end_dot_

 mcconnell s campaign is running commercials back home touting his appetite for spending on things such as _meta_dollor_ref_ million for medical research at kentucky universities and a tobacco buyout program for kentucky farmers _meta_end_dot_

 instead of spurning obey today mcconnell should have followed sen _meta_end_dot_

 jim demint s lead and praised the liberal wisconsin democrat _meta_end_dot_

 another day another wasted opportunity _meta_end_dot_
