  i haven t followed ron paul closely and while i like many of his libertarian ideas i am discomforted by his overall anti intellectual demeanor _meta_end_dot_

 he strikes me as the kind of person who has a natural attraction to conspiracy theories _meta_end_dot_

 however he is only allowed to believe the ones that coincide with his libertarian ideology _meta_end_dot_

 which isn t so many most of those theories are dreamt up by non libertarians and thus have anti libertarian elements and that means he ends up sounding more somewhat sensible than he really is _meta_end_dot_

 i don t doubt paul s sincerity but i would like to know his theory of why most economists even market oriented ones don t agree with him on monetary policy _meta_end_dot_

 i suspect he thinks he knows some secret that others do not _meta_end_dot_

 there s what a politician believes and how a politician believes _meta_end_dot_

 as i get older i put increasing weight on the latter _meta_end_dot_

 as a protest vote ron paul seems fine but hearing him or reading about him just makes me depressed _meta_end_dot_

 a good rule of thumb is not to get too excited about any candidate whose actual election would make the dow lose thousands of points _meta_end_dot_

 tyler cowen _meta_end_dot_

 note the first sentence of point _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 reminds me of this _meta_end_dot_
