 to the new diarists look at this and absentee s other work and only a select few others to see just how diaries should be done _meta_end_dot_

 yesterday i attended a fred event in south carolina _meta_end_dot_

 i thought fred was great _meta_end_dot_

 he looked good he sounded good _meta_end_dot_

 well actually he didn t sound good he sounded like his sound system was a big steaming pile of broken wires _meta_end_dot_

 which it was _meta_end_dot_

 but his answers sounded great _meta_end_dot_

 perfect actually _meta_end_dot_

 fred thompson knows what he is talking about and he has the right answers _meta_end_dot_

 not only that he delivers them so well so believably and sincerely that you can t help but feel on board _meta_end_dot_

 fred thompson is in short a great conservative _meta_end_dot_

 he is the reagan coalition coalesced _meta_end_dot_

 god bless him _meta_end_dot_

 but this blog entry is not about fred thompson _meta_end_dot_

 read on _meta_end_dot_

 i ve been a fred supporter for awhile _meta_end_dot_

 i came on board based on his record i stayed on board based on his platform _meta_end_dot_

 i have blogged for and donated to fred _meta_end_dot_

 i want his message out there for the world _meta_end_dot_

 i believe his conservative answers are the right answers _meta_end_dot_

 but this blog entry is not about fred thompson _meta_end_dot_

 tonight i went to another political event _meta_end_dot_

 i went to see senator john mccain _meta_end_dot_

 i ve decided not to wait for saturday _meta_end_dot_

 i m supporting john mccain for president _meta_end_dot_

 you may wonder why you should care _meta_end_dot_

 am i pompously trying to ride the roller coaster of fame and fortune following my clich s blog hitting the corner _meta_end_question_

 yes that was obviously a watershed moment in the annals of internet history but no that s not why _meta_end_dot_

 i think my support is relevant because i feel like i m representative of something we re going to see happen saturday _meta_end_dot_

 i think i m a good barometer or at least eyewitness for something that is already happening here _meta_end_dot_

 but this blog entry is not about me _meta_end_dot_

 john mccain s town hall was fantastic _meta_end_dot_

 in every way it was superior to fred s including and it truly pains me to say this including the actual candidates themselves _meta_end_dot_

 it is not just the fact that john s sound system worked and fred s didn t _meta_end_dot_

 it is not just that john had tom coburn and lindsey graham there singing his praises _meta_end_dot_

 it s not just that the whole experience was professional and well run _meta_end_dot_

 it was john _meta_end_dot_

 i m sorry i really really am _meta_end_dot_

 i love fred _meta_end_dot_

 but there was just no comparison _meta_end_dot_

 john mccain had the crowd fired up _meta_end_dot_

 he made his points _meta_end_dot_

 he got you to listen _meta_end_dot_

 john mccain showed he was a leader _meta_end_dot_

 i learned some hard facts this week facts i ve been fighting not to learn _meta_end_dot_

 the problem with fred s candidacy is winning _meta_end_dot_

 it s that i can t see him winning not out there among the crowds _meta_end_dot_

 don t call it electability in that snide tone with those rolling eyes as if it were the high school version of popularity _meta_end_dot_

 it s more than who likes him _meta_end_dot_

 it s more than the numbers of delegates or the branches of conservativism he represents _meta_end_dot_

 it s about being the man that americans are going to follow to war _meta_end_dot_

 war was a big topic tonight _meta_end_dot_

 i don t mind telling you as a former marine with those i care about in harm s way john mccain s record matters to me _meta_end_dot_

 frankly i m literally disgusted by those who sneer at bringing up his war record and i use that word with absolute sincerity _meta_end_dot_

 character counts _meta_end_dot_

 it matters _meta_end_dot_

 it s not a kerry record we are talking about here _meta_end_dot_

 it is not the mere fact of military service without context _meta_end_dot_

 john mccain s character is illustrated by his stellar service to his country by his steadfast spirit in the face of his captors _meta_end_dot_

 it s not just that he was in the military _meta_end_dot_

 it s the integrity and heroism that marked his service _meta_end_dot_

 don t try and sell me on the idea that that s not relevant _meta_end_dot_

 it manifestly is _meta_end_dot_

 but this blog entry is not about his service _meta_end_dot_

 john s town hall tonight found a largely receptive audience but like here at redstate even those who were disposed to listen to him had issues they wanted to challenge him on _meta_end_dot_

 i m not going to go into the policies he espoused i think they re well documented by better bloggers here at redstate _meta_end_dot_

 what i do want to express is what he brought to bear here tonight _meta_end_dot_

 some people snicker at the straight talk slogan _meta_end_dot_

 i do not _meta_end_dot_

 straight talk is exactly what i heard _meta_end_dot_

 john does not pander to his audience _meta_end_dot_

 he does not back away from his positions _meta_end_dot_

 you tell me which republican candidate besides john mccain is going to talk about conservation in south carolina _meta_end_dot_

 which one _meta_end_question_

 who would dare bring up an environmental topic here _meta_end_question_

 i don t buy man made global warming _meta_end_dot_

 some of you may remember my tirade a few weeks ago about the attempted indoctrination of my children _meta_end_dot_

 it was a tirade because i don t buy it _meta_end_dot_

 but john mccain didn t pander to me about it _meta_end_dot_

 you know what he talks about isn t so different from what those of who aren t members of the agw club talk about _meta_end_dot_

 he says ethanol subsidies are a mistake _meta_end_dot_

 they are _meta_end_dot_

 he says dependence on foreign oil is a major vulnerability _meta_end_dot_

 it is _meta_end_dot_

 he says we need more nuclear power _meta_end_dot_

 i cheered _meta_end_dot_

 but this blog entry is not about global warming thank goodness _meta_end_dot_

 john talked tonight and people listened to him _meta_end_dot_

 he was fearless _meta_end_dot_

 he was compelling _meta_end_dot_

 he was convincing _meta_end_dot_

 he was energetic _meta_end_dot_

 he was fired up _meta_end_dot_

 here s what the blog is about belief _meta_end_dot_

 yes belief _meta_end_dot_

 i said it _meta_end_dot_

 i believe john mccain but more importantly i believe in john mccain _meta_end_dot_

 i believe he will secure the border _meta_end_dot_

 i believe he will tackle social security _meta_end_dot_

 i believe and tom coburn believes and let me tell you the democrats cower in fear with belief that john will absolutely go to war against government waste and spending _meta_end_dot_

 look at the endorsements and friends that are lining up with john _meta_end_dot_

 war is coming to washington _meta_end_dot_

 war on high taxes and an absurd tax code _meta_end_dot_

 war on spending _meta_end_dot_

 war on pork _meta_end_dot_

 war on corruption _meta_end_dot_

 john mccain and his allies are bringing a war to washington and i believe in him _meta_end_dot_

 there is more of course _meta_end_dot_

 john will make a great commander in chief _meta_end_dot_

 when john was out front criticizing rumsfeld it was out of principle _meta_end_dot_

 it was out of his desire to protect and honor our troops and it was from his mission in life to serve this country well _meta_end_dot_

 and when the petraeus reign began john was out front there as well _meta_end_dot_

 i know what i remember john was calling for more troops before anyone else _meta_end_dot_

 he may not be an architect of the surge but he is at least an ideological forefather of the surge _meta_end_dot_

 this is a man a leader who knows what is required for the security of this nation and yes mr _meta_end_dot_

 and mrs _meta_end_dot_

 snarky that includes securing the border _meta_end_dot_

 this blog entry is about belief _meta_end_dot_

 i wanted to believe in fred _meta_end_dot_

 i tried to believe in fred _meta_end_dot_

 i worked at believing in fred _meta_end_dot_

 and then john mccain inspired my belief _meta_end_dot_

 i m tired of hearing about the republican party being at a crossroads _meta_end_dot_

 this nation is at a crossroads _meta_end_dot_

 i know we have some wars to fight in the coming years and not just militarily _meta_end_dot_

 john mccain is the man i hope leads us in those wars and he is the man i believe has the strength courage and integrity to do it _meta_end_dot_

 bring war to washington senator mccain _meta_end_dot_

 i m with you _meta_end_dot_

 and fred thompson for vice president_meta_beep_ref_
