  this article in esquire magazine is apparently a big deal for our anti war i love losing crowd _meta_end_dot_

 in it we find a thomas barnett who fancies himself a stick buddy of admiral fallon the soon to be no longer commander of central command _meta_end_dot_

 barnett also allows his piece to imply that it was fallon who has been serving all this time as secretary of state instead of condoleeza rice and he shows us once again how really cool you can be if you throw around a few f bombs and drop the neocon slam here and there interspersed between lots of nuance and innuendo that furthers a preconceived political agenda _meta_end_dot_

 what outstanding reporting we are graced with once again by one who continues searching for new and ever more creative ways to convince us we must stop fighting enemies who would see us and our allies dead give them what they want and they ll go away or somesuch nonsense _meta_end_dot_

 these people need to stop working so hard they might pop a blood vessel if they don t calm down _meta_end_dot_

 i really can t exert the required energy to review barnett s piece here an op ed in the form of a news and biographical article there s just no point in trying to argue with folks willing to align themselves with underlings by propping them up into a thing they are not fallon was an admiral bush is still commander in chief and gates is still well was fallon s direct boss _meta_end_dot_

 whooptydoo _meta_end_dot_

 i m more interested in what s not being said during all this hub bub about a military guy that did a job for _meta_number_ref_ months and is now being rotated out _meta_end_dot_

 i thought we were supposed to be doing rotations to keep our guys fresh _meta_end_dot_

 please war haters put your memory caps on and recall the hype about a navy guy taking over centcom how it was to be a new beginning a change in how bush was to manage the war and prepare for the peace and that maybe just maybe fallon actually failed at one or more of his assigned objectives _meta_end_dot_

 heck petraeus has done far better with his assignment than fallon just because the admiral thinks war with iran might be ill advised do we really have to make this retirement business into something that it s not _meta_end_question_

 more below the fold _meta_end_dot_

 let us recall one maj _meta_end_dot_

 gen _meta_end_dot_

 john batiste who was hailed by the nowarlibs as a hero for speaking truth to power _meta_end_dot_

 let us also recall batiste s almost immediate engagement with that anti war veterans group votevets link intentionally not provided and his year long anti bush and anti rumsfeld tirade before coming to his senses and changing teams and switching sides to join up with vets for freedom link again not provided to be fair not that i really need to be fair given how the opposition likes to play _meta_end_dot_

 can we agree that fallon just might be seeing his glory days behind him now and looking for a new gig _meta_end_question_

 rattling a few of his own bush sucks sabers and looking to secure a book deal perhaps _meta_end_question_

 a position in the pacifist regime of an obama presidency _meta_end_question_

 just maybe _meta_end_question_

 who knows maybe the admiral will be the next secdef unless he wants state given his failures to secure political success in baghdad _meta_end_dot_

 after all everybody loves a democrat that fails at everything so long as they make the compelling argument that they tried only to have been beaten back by eeeeevil republicans _meta_end_dot_

 if you swallow every morsel barnett throws in this piece then surely you can accept that fallon was responsible for making nice with the chinese _meta_end_dot_

 his double secret probation role of secstate must be the cause of our bonny new group hug with our communist friends _meta_end_dot_

 and assuming this is fallon s diplomacy legacy and rememberinig how much the democrats like to revel in iraq s ongoing failures politically then can we assume that fallon is actually being booted because he failed the us diplomatically in iraq _meta_end_question_

 why even the democrats have been forced to reluctantly admit that the surge is working on the security front _meta_end_dot_

 that my friends is surely the fault of petraeus is it not _meta_end_question_

 don t bother yourselves with trying to square all this logic in your minds _meta_end_dot_

 it matters not at all that fallon was petraeus boss and that fallon oversaw the military successes via the surge _meta_end_dot_

 all that matters is continuing to push the meme of bush being a war monger and any of us who believe iran is a threat and should be routinely and repeatedly reminded that we have no qualms about taking them out if they appear ready to raise a mushroom cloud over jerusalem are just knuckle dragging neocons and chickenhawks _meta_end_dot_
