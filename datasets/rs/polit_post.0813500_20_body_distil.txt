  as crosses burn hillary sweeps across west virginia tonight with a massive victory i have to wonder how many members of the msm will change the obama wins narrative at least only slightly to recognize that obama is in fact the weaker candidate in a general election match up with john mccain _meta_end_dot_

 when indiana and north carolina voted last week the msm was gleeful pointing out that mccain the gop nominee was still seeing double digits worth of votes go to huckabee ron paul and others _meta_end_dot_

 here now this week and next week barack obama the presumptive democrat nominee will have lost every election since february except north carolina and guam and lost nearly two thirds of the vote in west virginia and yet the media will sweep it all under the rug flailing about wildly to find burning crosses and white sheets instead of recognizing obama s significant general election vulnerabilities _meta_end_dot_

 hillary is still done for in the media s mind but barack still can t win _meta_end_dot_

 the media will ignore that _meta_end_dot_

 after all west virginia and kentucky and indiana and puerto rico are all racist _meta_end_dot_

 when the sun sets on this election we might have to realize that the media s efforts to set up obama as the democrat nominee has been the greatest gift they ve ever given to the gop _meta_end_dot_
