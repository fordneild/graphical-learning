  jay lefkowitz is president bush s special envoy to north korea on human rights issues _meta_end_dot_

 as such he has had a chance to study the way the north korean regime operates often from the inside and has formulated some conclusions about the six party talks on north korea s nuclear weapons programs _meta_end_dot_

 he is not optimistic _meta_end_dot_

 in a speech at the american enterprise institute last week mr _meta_end_dot_

 lefkowitz called for a new strategy in dealing with north korea s intransigence on both the human rights and nuclear front _meta_end_dot_

 but before that can happen there must be an understanding that the current negotiating framework is failing _meta_end_dot_

 mr _meta_end_dot_

 lefkowitz delivered a sober rational and convincing speech that examined the history of negotiations with pyongyang and looked at the underlying reasons why north korea and indeed all dictatorial regimes behaves the way it does _meta_end_dot_

 his reward for his insights and his calm and reasoned look at u s _meta_end_dot_

 policy toward north korea was a public rebuke from none other than secretary of state condoleezza rice _meta_end_dot_

 secretary rice it seems is increasingly becoming a creature of the establishment at the state department unwilling to sacrifice talking for the sake of concrete actions _meta_end_dot_

 read on here is the primary offending passage from mr _meta_end_dot_

 lefkowitz s speech but lefkowitz isn t just a pessimist _meta_end_dot_

 he bases his criticism on an understanding of dictatorships their motivations and north korea in particular _meta_end_dot_

 later in his talk he examines north korea s record on human rights in the context of its threats to its neighbors and concludes rightly that the two are not unrelated _meta_end_dot_

 this is a very real world view that mr _meta_end_dot_

 lefkowitz is espousing _meta_end_dot_

 it is not in any way radical or an attack on the administration s current policy in the six party talks _meta_end_dot_

 to the contrary lefkowitz goes on to praise the strategic rationale behind the talks namely that regional players like china and south korea would assist in reigning in the north by acting out of their own national interests _meta_end_dot_

 lefkowitz does not criticize this approach he merely points out that it hasn t worked _meta_end_dot_

 north korea has failed to dismantle its nuclear facility at yongbyon and disclose all of its nuclear weapons programs _meta_end_dot_

 instead it has resumed issuing threats no doubt in an attempt to win further concessions at the talks _meta_end_dot_

 but secretary rice is too engaged in the process for the sake of hers and the administration s legacy to allow any critique of the talks even reasoned ones to go unchallenged _meta_end_dot_

 rice went out of her way to discredit lefkowitz by pointing out that he is not involved in the six party talks and doesn t speak with authority on u s _meta_end_dot_

 policy in them _meta_end_dot_

 lefkowitz never claimed to be a participant in the six party talks _meta_end_dot_

 he states flat out in his remarks that human rights is not and never has been a part of the negotiations _meta_end_dot_

 he is advocating for a change in the structure of the talks based upon the results that have been achieved thus far which is to say nothing _meta_end_dot_

 lefkowitz sees human rights as essential to any negotiation with north korea _meta_end_dot_

 rice clearly does not _meta_end_dot_

 perhaps this is because the bush administration is hurrying to tie up loose ends in its final year in office _meta_end_dot_

 this isn t altogether a bad thing unless in the rush to solidify a legacy the administration makes bad deals just for the sake of making any deal _meta_end_dot_

 only the most unrealistic observer of north korea s past behavior could possibly believe that lefkowitz is off the mark when he says that it is increasingly likely that the north will still be nuclear armed at the end of the bush administration s term _meta_end_dot_

 north korea cannot be trusted in negotiations no matter what promises they make who vouches for them or what intermediate steps they may take _meta_end_dot_

 the united states will only know that the north is living up to its agreements when it can get in the country and independently verify the claims of progress _meta_end_dot_

 as an old soviet union expert rice understands this _meta_end_dot_

 but it appears in this case that the secretary is more interested in protecting a fragile and thus far fruitless negotiation than she is in actually achieving long term results _meta_end_dot_

 in the world where holding a meeting is not considered an accomplishment the six party talks have been a worthwhile disappointment _meta_end_dot_

 the bush administration was right to engage in them in an attempt to solve the nuclear issue on the korean peninsula _meta_end_dot_

 but it would do well to remember why there is a nuclear issue to begin with _meta_end_dot_

 in _meta_number_ref_ it caught north korea cheating on the _meta_number_ref_ agreed framework the last agreement in which the north promised to forego development of nuclear weapons in exchange for certain concessions from the united states _meta_end_dot_

 having paid no substantial penalty for violating that deal the north is negotiating another one which it will certainly break whenever it feels the need _meta_end_dot_

 secretary rice should heed lefkowitz s observations not dismiss them _meta_end_dot_

 and she should familiarize herself with the axiom once bitten twice shy _meta_end_dot_
