  university of chicago but not for long law professor cass sunstein makes the case for conservatives appreciating barack obama _meta_end_dot_

 he does so by writing in part the following supporter of nafta rather than one who unfairly trashes it at every opportunity _meta_end_dot_

 i realize that it is important for candidates to broaden their appeal and one can easily see how sunstein works and labors to ensure that obama looks as appealing as possible to conservatives note the portion of sunstein s editorial in which he states that s ome local reagan enthusiasts are obama supporters without identifying who those local reagan enthusiasts might be _meta_end_dot_

 but saying that obama appreciates the virtues and power of free markets doesn t pass the giggle test when he misses the boat on an issue as easy and uncontroversial as the issue of whether free trade has been good for america _meta_end_dot_

 i have said before and will say again that i find barack obama to be quite intelligent quite gifted at speaking and politicking and a formidable force in every respect _meta_end_dot_

 that does not mean however that he is the kind of politician to whom genuine conservatives and right of center libertarians can gravitate _meta_end_dot_

 i have no problem with the contention that obama will be a respectable opponent certainly more respectable than any of the clintons but the post partisan messiah he ain t _meta_end_dot_

 a hearty nice try to professor sunstein _meta_end_dot_

 unfortunately for him he fails to persuade _meta_end_dot_
