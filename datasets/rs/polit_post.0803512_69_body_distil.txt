  a friend called me the other day _meta_end_dot_

 he asked can you explain why i hate john mccain so much _meta_end_dot_

 because i really hate that redacted _meta_end_dot_

 i hate this whole election cycle _meta_end_dot_

 i feel like i ve got to choose between the evils of four lessers that does not apply for everyone but for a lot of republicans this year they feel the same way _meta_end_dot_

 if you are one of them it s important to keep a few things in mind _meta_end_dot_

 first this is an election cycle that plays to the democrats strengths _meta_end_dot_

 as a result a lot of the dream candidates were smart to sit out _meta_end_dot_

 the odds are against a third consecutive republican victory _meta_end_dot_

 the one guy who could have united the party would not run and was smart to sit on the sidelines _meta_end_dot_

 after all the country probably wants a break from electing guys with the last name bush even if he was a very popular governor in florida _meta_end_dot_

 second we play with the players we have not the players we want _meta_end_dot_

 this year we are left with mitt romney john mccain mike huckabee and cough ron paul _meta_end_dot_

 take your pick _meta_end_dot_

 not happy _meta_end_question_

 blame bush _meta_end_dot_

 he could have set us up with a preferred candidate through the vice presidential process _meta_end_dot_

 he did not _meta_end_dot_

 now actually because of my first point that s actually not a bad thing _meta_end_dot_

 the gop would probably flock to such a candidate and the voters as a whole will assuredly want to distance themselves from the bush legacy _meta_end_dot_

 they are tired _meta_end_dot_

 keep reading _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 third and most importantly this election cycle is unlike any other in recent memory for republicans _meta_end_dot_

 think about this _meta_end_dot_

 in _meta_number_ref_ we had ike _meta_end_dot_

 that was a no brainer _meta_end_dot_

 same for his re election in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 in _meta_number_ref_ we had nixon again a no brainer because he was the vice president _meta_end_dot_

 in _meta_number_ref_ it went to nixon again and then his re election in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 in _meta_number_ref_ we had an incumbent republican candidate _meta_end_dot_

 in _meta_number_ref_ though the establishment went elsewhere ronald reagan was the presumed heir _meta_end_dot_

 in _meta_number_ref_ it was reagan s re election _meta_end_dot_

 in _meta_number_ref_ it was the continuation of reagan bush by putting bush on top _meta_end_dot_

 in _meta_number_ref_ it was bush s re election with a few wayward souls going for buchanan _meta_end_dot_

 in _meta_number_ref_ though there was a plethora of candidates most of the establishment and base were rallying around bob dole _meta_end_dot_

 in _meta_number_ref_ by and large the party was a bush party again with only mccain as the credible alternative _meta_end_dot_

 in _meta_number_ref_ it was bush again _meta_end_dot_

 to be sure in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ and _meta_number_ref_ there were other candidates garnering support but there was also the entire time a candidate best described as the party s heir that candidate objectively presumed to be the nominee based on healthy support from both the establishment and grassroots _meta_end_dot_

 this year is completely different _meta_end_dot_

 mccain should be the heir but his habit of stiffing the gop has hindered his coronation _meta_end_dot_

 romney has a lot of the establishment conservative movement but not a majority of the base _meta_end_dot_

 huckabee has a large but still minority portion of the social conservatives but not much else _meta_end_dot_

 giuliani and thompson arguably had the best shot at uniting the establishment and base but they failed to do so _meta_end_dot_

 thus we enter _meta_number_ref_ without an heir to the party _meta_end_dot_

 it s like _meta_number_ref_ all over again _meta_end_dot_

 in that cycle there was a battle for the party between goldwater and rockefeller with henry cabot lodge jr _meta_end_dot_

 playing the role of rudy giuliani with a better shot of winning _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ saw no heir apparent to the party and there was a fight between the moderate wing and the conservative wing _meta_end_dot_

 the conservatives won _meta_end_dot_

 this year with no heir apparent that fight has come back but it is arguably between versions of conservatives than between the left and right within the party _meta_end_dot_

 of course all of this is to say take heart _meta_end_dot_

 this is a mostly unique year that we hopefully won t repeat again _meta_end_dot_

 it ll probably be resolved on tuesday _meta_end_dot_

 those of you too disgusted to stick with the guy who wins can sit this one out _meta_end_dot_

 it ll be over in ten months _meta_end_dot_

 just remember if you don t show up to vote you re also going to be hurting the gop in congressional state and local races _meta_end_dot_

 in the meantime you should be putting pressure on the candidates to make sure they find a real conservative to be their running mate a sanford a nickels a bush or someone close _meta_end_dot_
