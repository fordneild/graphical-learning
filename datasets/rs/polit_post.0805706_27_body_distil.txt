  as i was doing my post market data scan on monday afternoon i stopped short to notice what had happened in trading of wheat futures on exchanges in the midwest _meta_end_dot_

 in after hours trading in chicago minneapolis and kansas city where different varieties of wheat trade prices were limit up across the board _meta_end_dot_

 some contracts were up _meta_number_ref_ percent on the day _meta_end_dot_

 most wheat varieties have been going for about _meta_dollor_ref_ a bushel give or take in recent weeks _meta_end_dot_

 today in minneapolis hard red spring wheat for march delivery traded at nearly _meta_dollor_ref_ a bushel _meta_end_dot_

 this contract was going for _meta_dollor_ref_ three months ago _meta_end_dot_

 march is the front month so there s no daily limit on its price movements _meta_end_dot_

 a bushel of wheat or soybeans is _meta_number_ref_ pounds _meta_end_dot_

 a bushel of corn is _meta_number_ref_ pounds this is totally wicked market action in a commodity that a year ago was trading for roughly half the price it is now _meta_end_dot_

 as i mentioned in a brief redhot the other night food prices will be the major wild card or uncertain factor in the global economy this year and well worth your attention _meta_end_dot_

 keep reading _meta_end_dot_

 as i write this about _meta_number_ref_am est on _meta_number_ref_ february wheat prices in asian markets are sharply higher again _meta_end_dot_

 corn and soybeans are sharply lower but higher than they were earlier in the session _meta_end_dot_

 i couldn t get any skinny by calling around after us markets closed on monday _meta_end_dot_

 there was no evident news to explain the action in the wheat market _meta_end_dot_

 then i noticed this news story filed from singapore _meta_end_dot_

 the bloomberg reporter on the story blames concerns about supply for the much higher prices _meta_end_dot_

 and the factor that most influences wheat supplies is the weather _meta_end_dot_

 it turns out that we had some unusually dry weather in many wheat growing regions around the world last year _meta_end_dot_

 this isn t a new story and you ve probably heard it here and there without paying much attention these regions include canada the upper midwest india australia china argentina pakistan and kazakhstan _meta_end_dot_

 the weather has had the effect of reducing global supplies of wheat to levels not seen in decades _meta_end_dot_

 that increases prices and reduces profits for everyone that uses wheat in products from bread cake and cookies to noodles and pasta _meta_end_dot_

 you ve probably seen another effect related to high grain prices many countries including china and kazakhstan have been adding export tariffs to keep their farmers from exporting wheat and other grains _meta_end_dot_

 this is an attempt to stem high food prices in those countries _meta_end_dot_

 i don t need to tell you that the chinese government in particular is deeply frightened by high food prices which historically have a nasty tendency to cause revolutions in that country _meta_end_dot_

 i m not an expert in agricultural production _meta_end_dot_

 my research suggests that there will be a lot of pressure on us farmers during _meta_number_ref_ to increase acreage of all major grain and oilseed products to make up for the shortfall caused by last year s weather _meta_end_dot_

 and that they will be hard pressed to meet the demand even assuming good weather _meta_end_dot_

 the department of agriculture reported that planting of winter wheat in the midwest increased by about _meta_number_ref_ percent _meta_end_dot_

 if the weather is good this should have the effect of moderating wheat prices by springtime and indeed futures markets seem to bear out this expectation _meta_end_dot_

 any adverse change in current weather conditions meaning not enough rainfall at the critical points in the growing season will make things much worse _meta_end_dot_

 prices for ethanol have also turned up in recent weeks reversing last year s downward trend and probably in sympathy with higher crude oil prices _meta_end_dot_

 this should add to the production of corn which is also at very high prices over _meta_dollor_ref_ a bushel right now and reduce production of soybeans in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 corn and sorghum are used primarily to feed livestock it s not clear to me that there is much of a substitution effect between wheat acreage and corn acreage _meta_end_dot_

 hopefully some of you readers will have the expertise to add more color to this in the comments _meta_end_dot_

 so although production is expected to increase this year it may not have much of a moderating impact on prices _meta_end_dot_

 and by the way you may be under the impression that we re talking about a very large business here _meta_end_dot_

 from my back of the envelope calculations the us will produce something like _meta_dollor_ref_ billion worth of wheat this year nearly half of which will be exported _meta_end_dot_

 obviously this is an order of magnitude calculation given how volatile prices have been that s two tenths of one percent of the us economy _meta_end_dot_

 add in corn soybeans sorghum and all the rest and you get something like a _meta_dollor_ref_ billion grain and oilseed economy _meta_end_dot_

 not really all that big _meta_end_dot_

 the department of agriculture s budget for subsidies alone is about _meta_dollor_ref_ billion _meta_end_dot_

 that s remarkable _meta_end_dot_

 you might even say that the government provides nearly all of the earnings of grain producers _meta_end_dot_

 the word subsidy may not even begin to describe what s going on here _meta_end_dot_

 but that s a discussion for another day _meta_end_dot_

 bottom line this will be a very challenging year for food prices around the world _meta_end_dot_

 and food is of course the most basic and important thing that economic activity produces _meta_end_dot_

 high prices and food shortages are just about the easiest way to destabilize a society as history has shown time and again _meta_end_dot_

 keep your eyes on this _meta_end_dot_
