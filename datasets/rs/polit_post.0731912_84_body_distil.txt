  i don t like seeing stories like this in the first place via instapundit that was a really good call that you made there john paul stevens anthony kennedy david souter ruth bader ginsburg and stephen breyer _meta_end_dot_

 thank you ever so much _meta_end_dot_

 i suppose that i should be grateful that our current crop of faux populist democratic candidates haven t seized on eminent domain as a political issue _meta_end_dot_

 it d be an extremely popular stance to take with regular citizens _meta_end_dot_

 on the other hand they are only faux populists _meta_end_dot_

 on the gripping hand given the predominance of democrats in urban bureaucratic structures too strong a stance against eminent domain abuse might be ah awkward _meta_end_dot_
