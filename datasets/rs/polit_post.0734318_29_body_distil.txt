 he asked him about that _meta_number_ref_ survey publicized by an opposing candidate in which huckabee talks about quarantining patients with aids _meta_end_dot_

 huckabee denied calling for such a quarantine rather he said they should look at established medical protocol rather than political correctness he said that his answer was based on our limited knowledge of aids in _meta_number_ref_ and wallace countered that the cdc had published in _meta_number_ref_ that aids could not be transmitted by casual contact _meta_end_dot_

 joe biden called for a special council to investigate the destruction of the interrogation tapes _meta_end_dot_

 joe biden told steph with a straight face that _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_percent_ref_ of what we pay for a barrel of oil is because of president bush s rhetoric _meta_end_dot_

 steph challenged this slightly but he let biden sputter and his claim remain _meta_end_dot_

 asserted joe biden our credibility internationally has been absolutely devastated absolutely devastated for the duration of the abc interview biden moved back and forth between this theme and another that we still had credibility which president bush would absolutely devastate if he did this or that of which joe biden did not approve _meta_end_dot_

 this administration is out of control joe biden observed in an act of projection _meta_end_dot_

 host george stephanopoulos brought up that newt gingrich thinks that the latest nie is an act of sabotage by disgruntled former state department employees _meta_end_dot_

 joe biden quipped i like newt gingrich i really do but who are you gonna believe steph showed a poll showing biden in the law single digits in iowa _meta_end_dot_

 joe biden smiled cocksure i m everybody s second choice with a broad smile on his face he promised steph that he would drop out of the race if he did as badly as the polls indicate _meta_end_dot_

 rudy giuliani on mtp _meta_end_dot_

 tim russert s guest on meet the press was _meta_number_ref_ gop hopeful rudy giuliani part of his meet the candidates shtick _meta_end_dot_

 russert opened by showing him the nbc mason dixon polls which shows mike huckabee crushing the nearest opposition _meta_percent_ref_ to _meta_percent_ref_ with rudy a distant fifth place with _meta_number_ref_ perecent _meta_end_dot_

 russert asked is that a problem rudy chuckled tightly and said that he wished russert had shown florida where he has an _meta_number_ref_ point lead _meta_end_dot_

 he pointed out that some polls show him ahead and that polls show that he s leading in most states _meta_end_dot_

 he promised to work hard maybe surprise a few people in iowa in new hampshire he s basing his campaign on doing well in florida _meta_end_dot_

 he said that if he wins a couple early florida for sure then he goes into february _meta_number_ref_th with leads in new york illinois california new jersey connecticut yeaaarrrrgh blue states the lot of them rudy says he s in even if he loses iowa and new hampshire _meta_end_dot_

 russert asked rudy about the latest nie _meta_end_dot_

 he asked if it removed the option of a pre emptive military strike against iran _meta_end_dot_

 rudy said that it did not as everything must remain on the table _meta_end_dot_

 the nie admits that it might not be correct _meta_end_dot_

 he pointed out that iran has shown that it is susceptible to the pressure of the threat of the use of military force as the nie said that it backed off its nuclear program in _meta_number_ref_ the year the united states militarily deposed saddam hussein _meta_end_dot_

 they realized that they could be susceptible to the same thing _meta_end_dot_

 russert asked skeptically if rudy were trying to claim that iran stopped its nuclear program because we deposed saddam hussein _meta_end_dot_

 rudy answered no but we have to look at what was going on in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 if the report is correct and he reminded russert of the nie s own caveats iran stopped its program at the same time as we deposed saddam acted in afghanistan and libya s qadaffi at long last gave up _meta_end_dot_

 the pressure was on _meta_end_dot_

 he suggested using the nie with our allies showing them that the pressure worked _meta_end_dot_

 russert quoted giuliani advisor norm podhoretz as arguing that we should bomb iran asap and that he was pretty sure rudy agreed with him _meta_end_dot_

 rudy said that his opinion was what he had just said to russert that the use of force was a last resort but should not be taken off the table _meta_end_dot_

 russert s questions often bordered on childish such as the one about cutting diplomatic ties with qatar but giuliani was an adult _meta_end_dot_

 i m not a giuliani supporter per se but he came across as prepared to be president _meta_end_dot_

 rudy was splendiferous and anyone who disagrees is not to be trusted as a human being whose soul is not a clod _meta_end_dot_

 scratch that _meta_end_dot_

 i m teasing rockefeller and hagel on ftn _meta_end_dot_

 host bob schieffer for this week s face the nation on cbs offered us two members of the senate intelligence committee democrat jay rockefeller and republican chuck hagel _meta_end_dot_

 rockefeller said that it was a very good question why were the interrogation tapes destroyed _meta_end_question_

 he speculated that there might have been things on the tapes which they didn t want anyone to see or that they might have wanted the discussion to be dropped _meta_end_dot_

 rockefeller said that he found out in _meta_number_ref_ that the interrogation vid had been destroyed _meta_end_dot_

 rockefeller said that he cannot say anything about what he s learned about torture on the intelligence committee not even with chuck though he did say that he was disturbed by it _meta_end_dot_

 the committee is going to call fbi director michael hayden _meta_end_dot_

 hagel said that there was no justification for destroying the tapes _meta_end_dot_

 he said that everyone has confirmed to him including a washington post story that torture doesn t work in interrogation _meta_end_dot_

 if it doesn t work he asked aloud why are we doing it _meta_end_question_

 we are saying what to the world _meta_end_question_

 that the army field manual applies only to the army not to the cia and those in the field _meta_end_question_

 hagel wants to know how far this goes up in the white house schieffer asserted that harriet miers was told about it and simply asked them to stop it but didn t tell the president _meta_end_dot_

 hagel is convinced that senior members of the white house had to have been told what with it rattling around for years _meta_end_dot_

 schieffer wondered it there were other tapes and rocky didn t know _meta_end_dot_

 he finds it curious that they started taping in _meta_number_ref_ and stopped it in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 rocky and chuck want congress to investigate the tapes not a special council _meta_end_dot_

 on iran hagel explained that intelligence is not a tidy little box rather it is a mosaic _meta_end_dot_

 the latest nie is the product of _meta_number_ref_ agencies coming to a conclusion _meta_end_dot_

 he argued that iran was still dangerous _meta_end_dot_

 schieffer said that this was the opposite of what the administration has been telling us for three years _meta_end_dot_

 rocky said that diplomacy can work citing north korea as his example _meta_end_dot_

 pervez on le _meta_end_dot_

 wolf blitzer s first guest on cnn s late edition was pakistani president pervez musharraf an interview taped this weekend he was wearing a three piece suit tan with a green ish tie but am i color blind _meta_end_question_

 no medals _meta_end_dot_

 blitzer asked him if it would be okay if the u s _meta_end_dot_

 acted on actionable intelligence and authorized us forces to march into pak to capture or kill osama bin laden _meta_end_dot_

 pervez did not agree saying that we share intelligence and within pakistan the pakistani forces will act blitzer suggested that various people in pakistan s military and intelligence are sympathetic to al qaeda and pervez took very strong exception _meta_end_dot_

 we are suffering here and he cannot imagine anyone sympathizing with those who are killing their brothers _meta_end_dot_

 pervez said that there has not been a failure of pakistani intelligence rather it is a failure of combined u s _meta_end_dot_

 and pakistani intelligence _meta_end_dot_

 those who criticize he said do not understand the situation on the ground _meta_end_dot_

 well musharraf was defensive _meta_end_dot_

 wolf quoted afghan president hamid karzai talking about terrorists crossing from pakistan into afghanistan and he tried to goad musharraf into attacking karzai _meta_end_dot_

 pervez explicitly refused the bait and speculated that the terrorists were crossing from afghanistan to pakistan _meta_end_dot_

 the real backbone of everything that s happening here is in afghanistan not in pakistan after a commercial break musharraf pledged that the pakistani elections in january will be free and fair blitzer quoted benazir bhutto and nawar sharif the two ex prime ministers as having declared that the elections will be rigged sharif s word _meta_end_dot_

 musharraf talked about how he s changed the law to make the elections more fair which things we not done during the tenure of the former prime ministers _meta_end_dot_

 musharraf said that they were preparing for defeat he suggested that they should accept defeat wolf kept asking him if bhutto and sharif would be allowed to run _meta_end_dot_

 musharraf pointed out that the media in the west treats every country like a dictatorship _meta_end_dot_

 he argued that there is a system in pakistan basically a rule of laws and not men _meta_end_dot_

 it is not his place to allow or to disallow anyone from running for anything _meta_end_dot_

 there was an old photograph behind musharraf s right shoulder under a lamp _meta_end_dot_

 musharraf said that he had to remove the former chief justice of the pakistani high court and he s not coming back he asked us to please understand us he would like to be interviewed by all media organizations see the environment on the ground in pak and don t judge him by the situation on the ground in the united states _meta_end_dot_

 john boehner on le _meta_end_dot_

 wolf s next guest on le was house gop leader john boehner _meta_end_dot_

 this one was live _meta_end_dot_

 wolf wondered if our aid to pak were well spent and boehner suggested that it was although what has been happening in the past few months has been troubling he expects the state of emergency to go away soon _meta_end_dot_

 blitzer asked him about the nie on iran _meta_end_dot_

 boehner wondered how we went from a dangerous nearly nuclear armed iran one moment to one without nukes now _meta_end_dot_

 either he doesn t have confidence in what the nie told him a few months ago he said or he doesn t have confidence in what they re saying now _meta_end_dot_

 he doesn t understand why it has changed so dramatically _meta_end_dot_

 boehner suggested that iran was still dangerous its leadership on the border of being crazy blitzer asked him about the cia destroying the vid in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 boehner said that the then cia chief the president and congress were not aware that this happened _meta_end_dot_

 he wants to get to the bottom of it _meta_end_dot_

 wolf said that biden had called for a special council and boehner thought there was no need for that _meta_end_dot_

 boehner accused congressional democrats of blackmailing the president for domestic spending when we need money to support our troops in iraq _meta_end_dot_

 it s the latest dem bill blitzer played a clip of steny hoyer asserting that bush has borrowed more money from foreign governments than anyone else combined _meta_end_dot_

 blitzer argued that the dems want only _meta_dollor_ref_ billion _meta_end_dot_

 boehner said that _meta_dollor_ref_ billion was a lot of money _meta_end_dot_

 blitzer argued that the republicans had increased the national debt _meta_end_dot_

 he accused the republicans of seeking to shut down the government and defunding the war simply because they refuse to give the democrats a measly _meta_dollor_ref_ billion _meta_end_dot_

 boehner said that the money was a waste and they have to reduce spending streamline the government _meta_end_dot_
