  on monday i went after howard dean and company for picking up obama s lies with another less than truthful ad _meta_end_dot_

 now factcheck org has examined the democrat s latest prevarications and found once again that the democrats ad twists what senator mccain actually said read on there s more _meta_end_dot_

 worse factchecker com found a second dnc ad this one distorting mccain s assessment of president bush s economic record during a january debate contains untrue claims dean and company know no shame _meta_end_dot_

 at least obama after being beat up by numerous factcheckers for grossly misrepresenting senator mccain s _meta_number_ref_ years comment finally dropped that distortion from his stump speech _meta_end_dot_

 obama stopped using that discredited attack because it became obvious to all even the admittedly obamamania infected main stream media that obama s misrepresentation of mccain s comment was a serious distortion to the point of rank falsehood how long will it be before the mainstream media takes chairman dean and the democrats to task for even more distortion rank falsehood seriously misleading statements and outright lying
