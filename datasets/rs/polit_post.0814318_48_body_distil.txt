  according to the almanac of american politics california s _meta_number_ref_st congressional district is the most productive farm district in the nation it represents _meta_percent_ref_ of the population of fresno county which produces more farm products in dollar value than any other county in the united states agricultural products produced in the district include milk oranges cattle grapes alfalfa plums cotton nectarines corn peaches grapes poultry almonds and pistachios so how did rep _meta_end_dot_

 devin nunes the republican who represents this district so dependent on agriculture vote on the farm bill _meta_end_question_

 he voted against it _meta_end_dot_

 the club for growth reports unfortunately the majority of nunes colleagues _meta_number_ref_ to be exact chose to override president bush s veto of the farm bill _meta_end_dot_

 in doing so they also sent a message to republican presidential nominee john mccain that they don t support his agenda to bring fiscal responsibility back to washington _meta_end_dot_

 there has been a lot of talk recently about whether or not conservatives are out of ideas but the problem with the modern conservative movement is not that it is out of ideas _meta_end_dot_

 there is no better example of this than the subsidies for millionaires farm bill _meta_end_dot_

 voters in mississippi s _meta_number_ref_st congressional district did not fail to turn out for greg davis because the democrat in the race promised to expand schip _meta_end_dot_

 they stayed home or voted for the democrat because they are fed up with the gop s business as usual ways in washington _meta_end_dot_

 and who can blame them _meta_end_dot_
