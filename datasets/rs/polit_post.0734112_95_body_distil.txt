 moe lane we used to talk like that when we were ambushed _meta_end_dot_

 we used to know the difference between a legitimate disagreement or even a conflict and a deliberate unannounced act of war _meta_end_dot_

 we used to have the will to see through to the end what had to be done to ensure the threat that revealed itself in that act of war never threatened us again _meta_end_dot_

 we used to think we d always be able to do that _meta_end_dot_

 sadly it would appear that we are not _meta_end_dot_

 hawaii is _meta_number_ref_ hours behind us here in tennessee _meta_end_dot_

 at _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_am december _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ the japanese conducted a surprise attack on the us naval base at pearl harbor _meta_end_dot_

 it was _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_am here in tennessee _meta_end_dot_

 over the next _meta_number_ref_ hours that attack would claim the lives of _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ americans and wounded another _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 time magazine has an excellent timeline of the events _meta_end_dot_

 here are a few excerpts _meta_end_dot_

 by the time the attack was over of the _meta_number_ref_ or so ships berthed at pearl harbor _meta_number_ref_ years ago over _meta_percent_ref_ were destroyed or damaged _meta_end_dot_

 the battleships arizona and oklahoma target ship utah and destroyers cassin and downes were destroyed _meta_end_dot_

 the battleships west virginia california and nevada and the minelayer oglala were sunk or beached but salvagable _meta_end_dot_

 the battleships tennessee maryland pennsylvania cruisers helena honolulu raleigh destroyer shaw seaplane tender curtiss and repair ship vestal were all damaged to some extent _meta_end_dot_

 almost _meta_number_ref_ aircraft were damaged or destroyed _meta_end_dot_

 if we take the german annexation of austria in march of _meta_number_ref_ as the start of wwii that conflict lasted a little over _meta_number_ref_ years and claimed about _meta_number_ref_ million lives in all around the world _meta_end_dot_

 that figure amounts to almost _meta_percent_ref_ of the total population of the world at that time _meta_end_dot_

 i doubt accurate figures on the number of wounded can even be approximated _meta_end_dot_

 we found the will and the determination to see that conflict through to the end despite these horrific figures _meta_end_dot_

 that determination in part earned the people who possessed it the name the greatest generation _meta_end_dot_

 that we cannot seem to find the same courage of conviction dishonors the sacrifice of those who entrusted their nation to us for safekeeping by paying the ultimate price to defend her _meta_end_dot_

 remembering pearl harbor _meta_end_dot_
