  what follows started as a regular email thread but spiralled into something we felt should be posted as a roundtable on the site a discussion of the future of gasoline powered automobiles in america _meta_end_dot_

 hunter baker this interview is profoundly disturbing with regard to the oil situation _meta_end_dot_

 can anyone help me feel better about it _meta_end_question_

 the rest of the roundtable follows _meta_end_dot_

 neil stevens there s a lot of self interest in that interview _meta_end_dot_

 he spends the early part of the talk going out of his way to explain how impossible oil is how we re never going to drill for it and how we can t transport enough of it _meta_end_dot_

 but when it comes to transporting the fruits of his project he waves it off with a transmission has got to be solved which is an obviously true statement that does nothing to suggests he knows if or how it will be solved _meta_end_dot_

 so anwr is impossible to get through the red green left but his stuff _meta_end_question_

 it ll get done _meta_end_dot_

 somehow _meta_end_dot_

 he wants investors to believe it anyway _meta_end_dot_

 ben domenech i was about to email exactly the same thing _meta_end_dot_

 pickens is being honest for the most part but there s a definite lean here _meta_end_dot_

 i still think nuclear is the way to go in a big way _meta_end_dot_

 it s the only way really _meta_end_dot_

 dan mclaughlin ben mccain is totally right on that too _meta_end_dot_

 it helps i think that as a navy guy and the son of a submarine guy he s comfortable with nuclear power _meta_end_dot_

 of course nuclear cars are not in the near future _meta_end_dot_

 i hope _meta_end_dot_

 francis cianfrocca blackhedd i don t think i can make you feel better _meta_end_dot_

 i could say that pickens has long been vocal about being convinced that global oil production has peaked and you could disagree with him _meta_end_dot_

 among the senior executives of the largest global oil companies only the ceo of royal dutch shell is willing to say out loud that he agrees _meta_end_dot_

 i don t like the fact that pickens doesn t connect the dots when asked about what it will take to solve the power transmission problem to the western states _meta_end_dot_

 i think what he s afraid to say because there are people he can t afford to piss off is that various state and federal agencies are inhibiting the cession of rights of way to people who would like to build new transmission lines _meta_end_dot_

 he doesn t bother to point out that wind power is a neither fish nor fowl proposition _meta_end_dot_

 power engineers speak of base loads and peak loads your basic nuclear and combined cycle coal turbines are good examples of base load power generation always on can t change the generation rate easily low cost _meta_end_dot_

 oil and natural gas fired turbines are for peak load generation switch it on and off in a minute high cost always available on a stand by basis _meta_end_dot_

 wind is not suited for either the base or the peak role because you can never be _meta_percent_ref_ sure it will be there _meta_end_dot_

 that makes wind power economics a total pain in the ass regardless of what boosters like pickens will tell you _meta_end_dot_

 do you remember the essay i posted on this ml but not on rs a few months back in which i proposed we raise the federal gas tax from _meta_number_ref_ cents to five or six dollars _meta_end_question_

 my point was nothing more or less than to collapse domestic demand for crude oil _meta_end_dot_

 and the reason i came to that radical view was because of the wealth transfer to the middle east which i estimated at that time to be _meta_dollor_ref_ trillion over ten years _meta_end_dot_

 prices are higher now and pickens is talking about _meta_dollor_ref_ trillion _meta_end_dot_

 but you ll notice that was the very first point he made _meta_end_dot_

 i remember using almost exactly the same terms he does our purchases of imported crude are the biggest transfer of wealth in history _meta_end_dot_

 hunter baker i do recall your thoughts on that _meta_end_dot_

 i think it is a good cure except for the severity of the side effects _meta_end_dot_

 i would very much like to see the issues of currency strength and the transfer of wealth via oil become centerpieces of the presidential campaign _meta_end_dot_

 francis cianfrocca blackhedd keep in mind that the whole discussion here centers on crude oil _meta_end_dot_

 i m considering only the objective of securing energy supplies not the green movement s objective of reducing total energy use _meta_end_dot_

 nuclear doesn t solve that problem for you _meta_end_dot_

 the primary energy source for electricity generation in this country is coal which isn t an immediately constrained resource _meta_end_dot_

 american industry just happens to be the most energy efficient in the world and by quite a significant margin regardless of the conventional wisdom _meta_end_dot_

 the low hanging fruit has already been picked _meta_end_dot_

 what that means is that if you compute energy use per unit of gdp we come out by far the best in the world _meta_end_dot_

 so then why does everyone know we re the most profligate energy consumer in the world _meta_end_question_

 it s because of motor transport _meta_end_dot_

 we and the canadians have the highest per capita use of energy in the world by a very large margin because we all drive around in cars all the time _meta_end_dot_

 but apart from needing to get to and from work and the logistics industry motor transport is a relatively small factor in american industrial production _meta_end_dot_

 that insight is why i m still in favor of the radical proposal of artificially making motor transport so expensive that we ll back off it sharply _meta_end_dot_

 that and only that will reduce our dependence on crude oil _meta_end_dot_

 the rest of the discussion is far less urgent _meta_end_dot_

 to the obvious objection someone will raise yes you conceivably could run automobiles with electricity generated with nuclear power _meta_end_dot_

 that s at least one major technological leap better batteries and _meta_number_ref_ or _meta_number_ref_ years to clear the regulatory and financial hurdles to nuclear development away _meta_end_dot_

 it doesn t solve the problem at all _meta_end_dot_

 dan mclaughlin and the reason the rest of us aren t with you on that proposal remains it would be a drastic change in consumer lifestyle and would fall disproportionately on people who vote republican _meta_end_dot_

 what we need and continue to lack is some commercially feasible way to replace oil in car engines _meta_end_dot_

 jeff emanuel and as those of us who don t live in fishbowl ny pointed out before your analysis and prognosis seems to treat that little fact that we all drive around in cars all the time as something that can be curbed or curtailed with little or no effect _meta_end_dot_

 you re basically talking about dropping a nuclear bomb on suburbia _meta_end_dot_

 we all drive around in cars all the time in large part because we who don t live on cap hill or in the city where every car is yellow and driven by ahmed have moved out of the cities where the business is conducted and therefore must drive to and from those places of work every day _meta_end_dot_

 were you to implement your proposal the effect would be catastrophic _meta_end_dot_

 sure the situation would eventually be resolved people would abandon the burbs and crowd back into the inner cities again straining the capacity of the infrastructure sanitation etc yay _meta_end_exclamation_

 every place could be like nyc but worse but that would take a significant amount of time _meta_end_dot_

 people can t uproot en masse tomorrow and procure living space within walking distance from work especially not without significant cost _meta_end_dot_

 the rest of the country is significantly different from new york city including in terms of available modes of transportation and suburban vs _meta_end_dot_

 urban living _meta_end_dot_

 i think some of those who live in nyc don t always grok that while _meta_number_ref_ million people do live there _meta_number_ref_ million do not by and large because they don t want to live in or like new york city _meta_end_dot_

 hunter baker so what s the story with the cars _meta_end_question_

 do we have a realistic way to start getting about two to three times the gas mileage _meta_end_question_

 francis cianfrocca blackhedd not unless you can figure out how to make a car that people will actually buy that weighs half or a third of what they weigh now _meta_end_dot_

 in this connection don t forget why suvs and other very large heavy vehicles are popular with women who are now the most important decision makers when it comes to buying cars _meta_end_dot_

 a woman generally has the not incorrect perception that if she s driving the largest heaviest vehicle in an accident her kids are the least likely to get killed _meta_end_dot_

 thomas crown what jeff and dan said _meta_end_dot_

 and it s also a bomb of unimaginable proportions on rural voters and citizens who don t commute to work in a city but have to drive to work as in not to get to work but their work is disproportionately tied up in driving or to get to the doctor or to get to the pharmacy or _meta_end_dot_

 we have this sort of elegiac view of country life as a bunch of small towns where everyone knows everyone else everyone gets everywhere on foot except when they go to the big city _meta_end_dot_

 that s so divorced from reality it makes you wonder if we all live on separate planets _meta_end_dot_

 dan mclaughlin well that sounds like a pretty accurate description of country life but from about _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 and what blackhedd said about suvs is completely true _meta_end_dot_

 thomas crown it will kill them _meta_end_dot_

 francis cianfrocca blackhedd i m well aware of all those objections and for what it s worth i m looking at moving to connecticut to be a state and city tax refugee _meta_end_dot_

 at that point i ll have to buy cars and hire my own private ahmeds _meta_end_dot_

 i m not foreseeing getting a driver s license myself _meta_end_dot_

 let me just drop this on you not as an argument but just as a thought to turn over in the back of your mind yes the disruption of severely curtailing motor transport would be huge _meta_end_dot_

 but it would also be responsive to the tremendous flexibility of our economy an unmatched advantage by the way and the still formidable ingenuity of our entrepreneurs _meta_end_dot_

 the problem of finding a gasoline alternative that would work with today s cars and today s distribution infrastructure is actually a far harder problem to solve _meta_end_dot_

 that s partly true because it would deeply involve the government rather than private entrepreneurs _meta_end_dot_

 solving the problem of an economy with one tenth the motor transport is far more likely to generate a resurgence of american economic leadership than solving the gasoline problem at least with any of the approaches to the latter that i ve heard _meta_end_dot_

 thomas crown the guy with four kids shares that perception which is why his wife s car is an suv _meta_end_dot_

 hunter baker again what the hell are we going to do about this _meta_end_question_

 is there any oil benefit to what we have done in iraq _meta_end_question_

 if the situation is truly grave and i am beginning to believe it is then i don t see how we can fail to do something very quickly _meta_end_dot_

 it can t be acceptable for us to just sit around filling the pockets of vlad putin _meta_end_dot_

 thomas crown well i see three options _meta_number_ref_ find other sources for hydrocarbons _meta_end_dot_

 or spend a ruthlessly inefficient portion of gdp on nuclear now _meta_end_dot_

 and kill harry reid _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ make our use of hydrocarbons more efficient _meta_end_dot_

 if we could go to external combustion engines instead of the heat generators that incidentally produce motion we currently use we d be set _meta_end_dot_

 of course our cars would all catch fire _meta_number_ref_ use bh s proposal and see how we all like the late nineteenth century _meta_end_dot_

 paul j cella this essay says there is already another options _meta_end_dot_

 well worth a read _meta_end_dot_

 francis cianfrocca blackhedd if the situation is truly grave then we have to do something very quickly that s the reason why i keep harping on this idea of sharply reducing motor transport now _meta_end_dot_

 think of it as an opportunity to knock hitler out at munich or the rhineland _meta_end_dot_

 yeah it s ugly nasty and costly and you ll catch bloody hell from everyone for it _meta_end_dot_

 the other course of action wait for harry reid stop blocking nuclear power and pray for a usable electric car sounds a lot better now _meta_end_dot_

 but is it _meta_end_question_

 thomas crown let me ask you this levelly how do we feed all of the people who can t work after we implement your proposal _meta_end_question_

 how do we provide utilities to them _meta_end_question_

 how do we create the infrastructure in which they ll live when their mortgages and leases go belly up _meta_end_question_

 how do we keep them busy so they don t turn into the animals we all are _meta_end_question_

 how much does all of this cost _meta_end_question_

 and where do we get the resources not the money for it _meta_end_question_

 ben domenech yes this was the objection i was going to raise _meta_end_dot_

 forgive me for quoting jay leno but this explanation sounds to me a lot like the folks who didn t want us to drill in anwr ten years ago because it wouldn t help for ten years at least _meta_end_dot_

 dan mclaughlin whatever else may be said about leno the man loves cars _meta_end_dot_

 and we are all most conservative about the things we know best _meta_end_dot_

 francis cianfrocca blackhedd ok look _meta_end_dot_

 i can see that millions and millions of people will be damned pissed if you change anything at all about how they live their lives now _meta_end_dot_

 but look at this us gdp is not nearly as energy intensive as many people think _meta_end_dot_

 that means if you curtail motor transport you ll disrupt people s lives but you won t throw them out of work that means this would not be a fatal disruption _meta_end_dot_

 no one would starve _meta_end_dot_

 instead they ll surprise you with the ingenuity that they use to come up with alternative arrangements _meta_end_dot_

 there are crazy ideas and there are stupid ideas _meta_end_dot_

 most crazy ideas are also stupid _meta_end_dot_

 but some crazy ideas have an under appreciated factor that makes them actually possible _meta_end_dot_

 those are the ones that change the world _meta_end_dot_

 neil stevens yeah you will _meta_end_dot_

 entire swaths of the country are completely dependent on the automobile _meta_end_dot_

 and no they can t all up and move back toward where the jobs are because even if they could afford it and even if the mortgage situation were completely preventing such a notion even if it wouldn t mean a massive drop in quality of life to go into some gang ridden polluted city there would be nowhere near enough places for them to live _meta_end_dot_

 dan mclaughlin more to the point they would vote out of office anyone who gets a fraction of the way down that path making moot the rest of the proposal _meta_end_dot_

 jeff emanuel same reason we can t fix entitlements francis cianfrocca blackhedd i don t know who jay leno is _meta_end_dot_

 if you re willing to wait for _meta_number_ref_ years for battery powered cars powered by nuclear plants what are you going to do about the _meta_dollor_ref_ trillion or more that we gift to the arabs between now and then _meta_end_question_

 let s do the nuclear thing _meta_end_dot_

 let s not fool ourselves into thinking it s a today solution rather than a tomorrow solution _meta_end_dot_

 the only way to object to my argument is to posit that crude oil is not a today problem _meta_end_dot_

 that actually is an open question and given that it s probably the decision the country will make _meta_end_dot_

 if you had stopped hitler in _meta_number_ref_ it would be portrayed in all the history books as a military disaster because a few dozen frenchmen would have died to say nothing of a criminal violation of germany s sovereignty _meta_end_dot_

 it wouldn t be remembered as the smartest move in history because no one but churchill saw what was coming _meta_end_dot_

 academic elephant it seems to me from this thread that it s not if we re going to go back to _meta_number_ref_ but when _meta_end_dot_

 in the short term with the bh approach to limiting motor traffic or the long term tc je plan to keep burning the hydrocarbons while we got em _meta_end_dot_

 i agree with ben _meta_end_dot_

 go nuclear do it now and do it big _meta_end_dot_

 on top of it make finding an affordable practical alternative to hydrocarbons for transportation the equivalent of the space race _meta_end_dot_

 then tell the saudis and hugo chavez to go _meta_beep_ref_ themselves _meta_end_dot_

 thomas crown whoa stop _meta_end_dot_

 i work at a law firm _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_percent_ref_ of what i do can technically be done if inefficiently by remote access _meta_end_dot_

 my driving to work is to make the work more efficient not to get it done period _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_percent_ref_ involves driving or flying before and or after driving to clients courthouses depositions site inspections whatever _meta_end_dot_

 some of those things including trials cannot happen as our system is structured without driving _meta_end_dot_

 i m very very lucky to work in such a job _meta_end_dot_

 how many other people can do that _meta_end_question_

 seriously how many _meta_end_question_

 how do you remotely figure that the guy who drives to the plant or the office or whatever can do almost everything at or within walking distance of home _meta_end_question_

 do you actually have hard numbers _meta_end_question_

 jeff emanuel ditto tc _meta_end_dot_

 i m lucky enough to be able to work remotely but not _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 the rest requires travel _meta_end_dot_

 francis cianfrocca blackhedd moving where the jobs are it may just be me _meta_end_dot_

 but i talk to people all day long who work for companies large and small _meta_end_dot_

 and if you have a long enough phone conversation with someone sooner or later you ll hear a kid crying or a dog barking _meta_end_dot_

 the american economy is already in a rapid transition to working at home _meta_end_dot_

 thomas crown is it worth stabbing yourself through the heart to kill your enemy _meta_end_question_

 thomas crown the only people like that with whom i deal are called court reporters and they have to do a hell of a lot of driving when they re not working at home _meta_end_dot_

 dan mclaughlin now that is the lede from this thread _meta_end_dot_

 francis cianfrocca blackhedd is it worth having a dangerous surgery to take out an angry tumor _meta_end_question_

 thomas crown is it worth leaving your femoral artery open to do so _meta_end_question_

 francis cianfrocca blackhedd no it s not _meta_end_dot_

 we re left disagreeing over how close the analogy is _meta_end_dot_

 i m going to drop this now _meta_end_dot_

 obviously it will go nowhere _meta_end_dot_

 in the meantime i m going to step up my investments in technologies that allow people to work more effectively from home _meta_end_dot_

 and i m also going to keep looking for businesses to fund that can actually be effective with a virtual work force _meta_end_dot_

 energy intensity is a critical factor in economic production _meta_end_dot_

 we can solve the energy intensity problem either by increasing supply or reducing demand _meta_end_dot_

 my bet is going to be on the latter _meta_end_dot_

 jeff emanuel telecommuting is one transition and trend i d love to see continue _meta_end_dot_

 unfortunately there will always be things that simply can t be done that way _meta_end_dot_

 further i d bet and i don t have numbers that it s the blue collar jobs the manufacturing the sanitation the construction etc _meta_end_dot_

 jobs that have the least flexibility of all vis a vis working on site vs _meta_end_dot_

 working from home _meta_end_dot_

 so some of your most integral workers who are also some of your lowest wage earners are all going to be taking it in the backside paying thrice or more as much for gas that they have to use while a white collar guy like me takes my _meta_number_ref_ figs and works from the home office _meta_end_dot_

 that s upside down at best _meta_end_dot_

 ben domenech i think we re glossing over the point where this conversation changes the political realities of what blackhedd proposes _meta_end_dot_

 to be generous they re just nil _meta_end_dot_

 there is no situation where an elected majority would support such a move _meta_end_dot_

 none _meta_end_dot_

 if we were a monarchy you could do this _meta_end_dot_

 but we re not _meta_end_dot_

 so crazy bad or crazy good it s just not an option _meta_end_dot_

 thomas crown there you go being practical _meta_end_dot_

 blackhedd probably won t one up my metaphor now _meta_end_dot_

 francis cianfrocca blackhedd ok let s negotiate _meta_end_dot_

 i d be happy to see a one third reduction in the number of miles driven in the us _meta_end_dot_

 that s a far cry from ninety percent yes the gasoline we save will get burned up in china and india but remember my point that this won t disadvantage us economically against them _meta_end_dot_

 you will have to give up on the romance of a sunday drive in the country and coming of age on the road movies let s put a _meta_dollor_ref_ gallon federal tax on gasoline _meta_end_dot_

 and anyone who is below a certain level of income say _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ files his gasoline receipts with his federal taxes and gets the tax rebated _meta_end_dot_

 now you ll get the change of behavior i m looking for but without slaughtering the people who must drive long distances to get to low paying jobs _meta_end_dot_

 thomas crown i appreciate the compromise attempt _meta_end_dot_

 let me offer this if your marginal income is such that you have say an extra _meta_dollor_ref_ per month to take care of all exigencies and contingencies and you drive normal hours to work how do you front that gas tax for a whole year _meta_end_question_

 remember the first year you take it in the rear theoretically assuming an instant rebate from the irs ha you then have your operating margin assuming nothing else changes for a year _meta_end_dot_

 how do you get by that first year _meta_end_question_

 jeff emanuel thomas which is why it couldn t be done _meta_end_dot_

 neil pretty much a restatement of what i said above _meta_end_dot_

 the short term alternative would be massive carpools with shared cost basically paying the same to ride in a car with a crowd that you did to drive yourself but with less overall flexibility or control but that assumes there s a support structure around that folks could lean on reliable friends room in the cars same time leaving home and leaving work same general work area _meta_end_dot_

 that wouldn t last especially since the best carpool vehicles would be those going extinct esuvees _meta_end_dot_

 neil stevens yeah you beat me to it the first time heh _meta_end_dot_

 you see moreno valley california was not only the fastest growing city of its size in america in the _meta_number_ref_s but also some national television newsmagazine determined we had the longest average commute in america too _meta_end_dot_

 paul cella sigh i wish someone would read the link i sent _meta_end_dot_

 it basically argues that there is already an alternative which has been tested and could be rapidly implemented _meta_end_dot_

 francis cianfrocca blackhedd i read that article months ago _meta_end_dot_

 it supports methanol as a motor fuel requiring an already known tweak to engine electronics _meta_end_dot_

 let s do it _meta_end_dot_

 how do we start _meta_end_question_

 ben domenech i read it too and favor it as a short term solution with nuclear as the long _meta_end_dot_

 francis cianfrocca blackhedd again my question is how do we get there _meta_end_question_

 the only answer appears to be through a government mandate _meta_end_dot_

 the auto industry doesn t give a s_meta_beep_ref_ about free markets and they ll do whatever the feds tell them _meta_end_dot_

 what they care about is two things they ll need an assurance that if the rules change they won t change again for the ten or twenty years that constitute their planning horizon _meta_end_dot_

 and they want to be sure that the rules are the same for everyone _meta_end_dot_

 this is a tough but possible negotiation _meta_end_dot_

 the oil industry will scream over this _meta_end_dot_

 but no one loves them these days and a democratic administration and congress won t have any trouble _meta_beep_ref_ing them _meta_end_dot_

 that s ok with me i ve already been lightening up my holdings of oil company stock _meta_end_dot_

 with oil at _meta_dollor_ref_ now you know i m a contrarian methanol feedstocks are primarily coal and natural gas _meta_end_dot_

 that s fine both are abundant in the us _meta_end_dot_

 but the green lobby aka the democratic party will fight over the replacement of one carbon fossil with another _meta_end_dot_

 at the end of the day that s your barrier to adoption _meta_end_dot_

 if i were a self respecting democrat i d approach the impending petroleum crisis in the following way first blame republican malfeasance during the bush administration as a way to avoid moving the ball on methanol or anything else _meta_end_dot_

 then ditch the ethanol subsidies the food shortages are perfect political cover for this move next make happy noises about nuclear which can t possibly solve the motor transport problem _meta_end_dot_

 finally wait for gasoline prices to hit the sky _meta_end_dot_

 at that point they can legislate a forced reduction in the usage of gasoline _meta_end_dot_

 since their whole tacit objective is really to make america use less energy regardless of the cost or impact the smart thing for them to do is to run out the clock while preventing any alternatives from getting traction _meta_end_dot_

 hunter baker i read paul s link _meta_end_dot_

 printed it out and took it to lunch _meta_end_dot_

 i actually feel much better _meta_end_dot_

 very good article _meta_end_dot_

 very good _meta_end_dot_

 thomas crown blackhedd i think you credit the evil party with an insufficient level of stupid _meta_end_dot_

 much as our party has its share of evil they have their share of stupid _meta_end_dot_

 incidentally you re right only way to do this is through mandates and not gentle ones either _meta_end_dot_

 hunter baker paul s link includes a rather imaginative mandate _meta_end_dot_

 you can just read the final third of the article _meta_end_dot_

 dan mclaughlin i m coming around to the methanol idea but i need to read further on it _meta_end_dot_

 leon wolf thomas or someone else can correct me on this but under all available technology the creation of any alcohol uses more energy than is created by the burning of that alcohol _meta_end_dot_

 i know for certain this is true w r t ethanol which is what makes ethanol the very most ridiculous environmental measure ever conceived of _meta_end_dot_

 thomas crown leon as a general proposition this is true _meta_end_dot_

 caveat that i m not a chemical engineer so there may be a process available to overcome what i understand to be ordinary microchemistry _meta_end_dot_

 essentially to make an alcohol of any kind you rip off a lightly bonded hydrogen atom this takes energy from a base carbon and shove an oh group on there this takes even more energy _meta_end_dot_

 carbon loves hydrogen _meta_end_dot_

 it s only fond of oxygen and in a multi valence molecule you have to overcome a tiny amount of resistance to add a clunky multivalence molecule on top a portion of that energy is lost forever _meta_end_dot_

 when you burn the alcohol essentially you are applying energy to the oh bond hoping to liberate it and the energy used to bond it to the carbon _meta_end_dot_

 thus putting externality issues to the side you have axiomatically released less energy that it took you to make the alcohol in the first place _meta_end_dot_

 furthermore the burning process does not always yield a perfect dissociation some of the alcohol will end up as other compounds some hydrocarbon some not axiomatically unless you can overcome basic thermodynamics you re going to get only a percentage of the oh bond energy you put in _meta_end_dot_

 any of you whose family ever ran a shine still as yes some of mine has will know a bit about this at a crude imperfect level those things give off s_meta_beep_ref_loads of heat energy take a lot of heat energy to run and the final product doesn t burn nearly as efficiently as the fuel that went into making it _meta_end_dot_

 methanol has certain advantages that ethanol does not not least being the least complex hydrocarbon in existence _meta_end_dot_

 this means that there s a little less energy required to shove the oh where you want it and of course less energy to detach the bond but i m not convinced that somehow extra energy comes into play that overcomes the loss from ripping off an h to make it ch_meta_number_ref_ in the first place let alone to overcome the residue and matter energy loss issues _meta_end_dot_

 full caveat that was one hell of a simplification _meta_end_dot_

 some of it is generally right but as worded isn t exactly right _meta_end_dot_

 i m trying to convey the idea not teach _meta_number_ref_st semester p chem _meta_end_dot_

 incidentally the real problem we have is that none of our fuel sources as utilized are good as witness the fact that we use an internal combustion engine _meta_end_dot_

 also when i say is lost forever with respect to energy i m not breaking newton s laws just referring to what we can and cannot reasonably ever recover dan mclaughlin i should add that this is not on environmental grounds at all but as blackhedd and the guy who wrote the methanol article urged on anti windfalls to the saudis grounds _meta_end_dot_

 the question is whether the methanol car or flexible fuel vehicle discussed in the article paul circulated is in fact a potentially economically and technologically workable solution _meta_end_dot_

 the article at least seemed to suggest that the only real obstacle was the lack of a critical mass of feuling stations _meta_end_dot_

 but again i could be persuaded that the guy was full of it _meta_end_dot_

 paul cella i have a good relationship with some of the new atlantis editors where that methanol essay appeared _meta_end_dot_

 i asked them the same question in more diplomatic terms _meta_end_dot_

 the consensus was that he may be a bit optimistic about the possibility but overall he s on solid ground _meta_end_dot_

 leon wolf well it also doesn t survive any long term fuel problems either because you re going to have to do something to generate the methanol ethanol and guess what that something is right now _meta_end_question_

 if you guessed fossil fuels you re correct _meta_end_exclamation_

 so in order to create enough ethanol to roughly equate to a gallon of gasoline we have to burn more than a gallon of gasoline _meta_end_dot_

 there s probably a more insane policy that we re pursuing right now but i can t think of one _meta_end_dot_

 paul cella the article suggests otherwise leon wolf i know virtually nothing about methanol i m talking about ethanol and the chemical reaction which creates it requires the addition of heat energy which has to come from somewhere _meta_end_dot_

 i m even skeptical of the process here described to create methanol _meta_end_dot_

 i know that for instance if you take a lot of trash and put it in a landfill the anaerobic environment generates a load of methane just from natural decomposition so i guess that part sounds believable but i d imagine there has to be some sort of leeching process to separate methanol that would be fuel grade and wouldn t destroy car engines _meta_end_dot_

 paul cella leon in the article this guy says the process is already pretty well perfected produces more efficient fuel than gasoline and is ready for use _meta_end_dot_

 jeff emanuel so can i put it in my car now _meta_end_question_

 or do i have to get a different one _meta_end_question_

 paul cella you d have to get a new one or cough up the dough for a costly refitting _meta_end_dot_

 but the big hurdle right now is that there is no fueling station infrastructure _meta_end_dot_

 dan mclaughlin also as the article explains there s methanol cars and there s hybrids ideally if we create a hybrid market we could get enough critical mass of feuling stations to make methanol only cars practicable _meta_end_dot_

 the guy also thinks ethanol is a boondoggle _meta_end_dot_

 francis cianfrocca blackhedd seems to me that there are two completely distinct issues mixed up in all of this _meta_end_dot_

 first is carbon emissions which the environmental crowd wants to sharply reduce presumably the co_meta_number_ref_ emitted by china and india is more equal than ours _meta_end_dot_

 unfortunately these people are part of the political future so they have a say in the outcome _meta_end_dot_

 to them it s more acceptable to burn carbon from plant matter rather than mined fossils because somehow it s part of the existing balance of atmospheric co_meta_number_ref_ and oxygen _meta_end_dot_

 ultimately they will be against any mode of alcohol production that depends on fossils like natural gas or petroleum _meta_end_dot_

 of course that interacts with the second issue which is basic thermodynamics _meta_end_dot_

 the introduction of fossil carbon into the fuel production matrix in any way shape or form is a leverage point _meta_end_dot_

 and i would argue strongly that it s the leverage point that has made the modern world possible _meta_end_dot_

 when you burn fossil carbon you re using energy today that was captured from the sun in the distant past _meta_end_dot_

 axiomatically that multiplies the amount of energy released today that s a critical point because it means that any sustainable mode of energy release meaning one that doesn t rely on already latent or fossil energy content can not possibly power the modern world with the cost efficiency we ve become used to _meta_end_dot_

 that means that if we go to full sustainability the cost of energy expressed as a production factor will necessarily and immediately increase toward pre industrial levels _meta_end_dot_

 and guess what _meta_end_question_

 that has already happened with ethanol _meta_end_dot_

 the precise chain of effects is complex and follows a pathway through the international monetary system but thermodynamically it s as plain as day _meta_end_dot_

 making sustainable energy inevitably reduces overall efficiency because it sacrifices the leverage of using energy that was fixed in place in a prior age _meta_end_dot_

 today this is showing up in price inflation for food and industrial commodities _meta_end_dot_

 the only ways to solve this problem without using fossil carbon are to use fossil nuclear the nuclear binding energy that fission releases was fixed in large atoms inside supernovas in distant time so the thermodynamic leverage is similar to that of fossil carbon or to radically improve the efficiency of all industrial processes including transportation _meta_end_dot_

 i think both approaches should be pursued _meta_end_dot_

 the fact that it takes more energy to produce methanol or ethanol than is contained in the fuel is actually a red herring _meta_end_dot_

 if you add in the energy fixed in petroleum by the natural processes which took place long ago you ll find exactly the same thing _meta_end_dot_

 again using fossil energy is far more efficient by its very nature although of course we can t do so indefinitely _meta_end_dot_

 that makes the path of radical efficiency the one that the world will need to take in future centuries _meta_end_dot_

 and finally in economic terms it doesn t really matter that it takes more energy to produce alcohol based motor fuel because the energy itself isn t the point of the exercise _meta_end_dot_

 the point is to get from point a to to point b in your automobile _meta_end_dot_

 the economic value of being able to do that is the determinant of how much you d be willing to pay for the processes that create the fuel _meta_end_dot_
