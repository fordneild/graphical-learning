  michael kinsley thinks that bill ayers and bernadine dohrn are not really such a big deal except to the extent they inadvertently helped republicans um no _meta_end_dot_

 kinsley admits right up front in the article the violent radicalism of the weather underground and its and specifically dohrn s implication in among other atrocities the _meta_number_ref_ brink s armored car robbery at the nanuet mall in my hometown a robbery that killed nyack police officer waverly brown nyack police sergeant ed o grady and brink s security guard pete paige who collectively left behind three widows and six fatherless children the youngest six months of age _meta_end_dot_

 i can promise you that i would not associate willingly with the likes of ayers and dohrn if they were on fire and i was carrying a bucket of water _meta_end_dot_

 nor would most of the people who remember the brink s case _meta_end_dot_

 kinsley and obama perhaps were still too angry about nixon and reagan to care _meta_end_dot_

 the problem with folks like ayers and dohrn was not that they made the political lives of liberals difficult _meta_end_dot_

 their real victims were the people killed by their organization _meta_end_dot_

 i vividly remember the brink s robbery it was the biggest news story ever in rockland county _meta_end_dot_

 when i worked at the rockland da s office for a summer they took us to see the evidence including the super thick windshield glass from the armored brink s truck that had a huge hole blown in it by their shotguns and m _meta_number_ref_s _meta_end_dot_

 so maybe ayers and dohrn were not actually going to bring the united states to its knees _meta_end_dot_

 they did quite enough harm thank you _meta_end_dot_

 tim mcveigh never posed any real threat to u s _meta_end_dot_

 national security either _meta_end_dot_

 nor did jeffrey dahmer ted bundy or the klu klux klan _meta_end_dot_

 would kinsley be unconcerned about a presidential candidate who counted those associations among his friends _meta_end_question_

 maybe next he ll just explain it away as a necessary part of politics like pandering to marxists _meta_end_dot_

 kinsley instead suggests that at worst obama is sorely lacking in judgment _meta_end_dot_

 read on _meta_end_dot_

 barack obama judgment no worse than that of chicago academics and newspapermen _meta_end_dot_

 what an endorsement _meta_end_dot_

 i ll leave you with some people who one would have preferred to associate with but who don t seem to be the types that run in barack obama s circles
