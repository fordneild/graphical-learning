  let s be clear about matters i am an adherent of realpolitik in terms of formulating foreign and national security policy _meta_end_dot_

 i believe that the primary function of american foreign and national security policy is to foster and promote american foreign and national security interests _meta_end_dot_

 that doesn t mean that i am not an internationalist far from it _meta_end_dot_

 it just means that nation states in an anarchic world are obliged to serve as the primary guardians of their own interests and the united states does not differ in this regard _meta_end_dot_

 at the same time only the obtuse would deny that there are moral and ethical issues involved in the design and implementation of foreign and national security policy _meta_end_dot_

 we are faced with a moral and ethical issue even now as we ponder what will be the next stage of our involvement in iraq _meta_end_dot_

 to that end note this article by jean bethke elshtain who will doubtless be excoriated as a warmongering neocon for her argument that we have an obligation to remain in iraq until the work of reconstruction is fully finished despite the fact that elshtain was against the war _meta_end_dot_

 the following excerpt neatly lays out the basic tenets of her argument how seriously do you think that middle eastern countries will take the united states should something so horrific happen in the wake of our precipitous withdrawal _meta_end_question_

 and what do you think will come of our national security and foreign policy interests both in the region and throughout the rest of the world if we ignore the fact that when it comes to iraq ethics and self interest correspond and to ignore the one is to completely undermine the other _meta_end_question_
