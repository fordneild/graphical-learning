  the huffington post has an update to their story of this past weekend saying that the clinton campaign has confirmed that it plans to use a may _meta_number_ref_st meeting of the democratic party s rules and bylaws committee to try and seat the entire michigan and florida delegations at the democratic national convention _meta_end_dot_

 the clinton campaign estimates that seating of the entire delegations from the two disputed states will give her a pledged delegate lead of around _meta_number_ref_ delegates over sen _meta_end_dot_

 barack obama _meta_end_dot_

 in a statement released in response to the story the campaign did not deny that it intended to exercise what the huffington post characterized as the nuclear option it only objected to the notion that the plan was a secret one _meta_end_dot_

 if the campaign follows through on this it may be left to the ultimate superdelegate dnc chairman howard dean to decide the democratic nomination _meta_end_dot_

 denver is going to be fun _meta_end_dot_

 read on sen _meta_end_dot_

 hillary clinton controls the rules and bylaws committee with at least _meta_percent_ref_ of its members supporting her _meta_end_dot_

 so it seems that she would have the inside track to getting the ruling she desires _meta_end_dot_

 but her performance in today s indiana and north carolina primaries as well as some upcoming contests is crucial _meta_end_dot_

 clinton needs to win big in indiana and lose close or upset obama in north carolina _meta_end_dot_

 less heralded but no less important to her strategy are contests in west virginia next week and kentucky in two weeks _meta_end_dot_

 clinton stands to win lopsided victories in both of those states perhaps by as much as _meta_number_ref_ points in each _meta_end_dot_

 assuming that comes to pass clinton supporters will have plenty of evidence that the controversy surrounding obama s relationship with his church s former pastor rev _meta_end_dot_

 jeremiah wright and comments he made about bitter small town voters have damaged his appeal with a key democratic voting bloc rural working class whites _meta_end_dot_

 she will have won pennsylvania indiana west virginia and kentucky rust belt states with similar demographics all after the revelation of wright s anti american sermons _meta_end_dot_

 throw in her victory in the general election bellwether state of ohio and it makes for a fairly convincing argument that clinton stands a better chance in november than obama against sen _meta_end_dot_

 john mccain _meta_end_dot_

 obama supporters won t take this lying down of course _meta_end_dot_

 they could protest the decision to the credentials committee of the democratic national convention which will meet after the primaries and before the convention opens in late august _meta_end_dot_

 the full make up of the committee is dependent on the outcome of the primaries _meta_end_dot_

 and true to everything about the democratic primary to date it is complicated _meta_end_dot_

 one hundred sixty one of the committee s _meta_number_ref_ members are allotted to each campaign in a ratio equal to the performance in each state contest _meta_end_dot_

 those results would necessarily mirror pledged delegate counts _meta_end_dot_

 under the current scenario obama would have a majority of the _meta_number_ref_ seats on the committee _meta_end_dot_

 but the process also means that the final makeup of the committee can not be determined until the primaries are over _meta_end_dot_

 in any case the split between obama and clinton supporting members will be razor thin _meta_end_dot_

 moreover should the rules and bylaws committee vote to seat the michigan and florida delegations there could be a battle over the make up of the credentials committee itself _meta_end_dot_

 michigan and florida would in theory be entitled to seats on the committee boosting sen _meta_end_dot_

 clinton s representation and enhancing the chance that the disputed delegation would win final approval _meta_end_dot_

 as if that wasn t chaotic enough the remaining _meta_number_ref_ members of the credentials committee are appointed directly by dnc chairman howard dean _meta_end_dot_

 one presumes that he would be able to swing his bloc of votes on the committee to whichever candidate he believed would make the better general election opponent for mccain _meta_end_dot_

 in his time as dnc chair dean has espoused the philosophy that the democratic party should be a _meta_number_ref_ state party and compete across all demographics _meta_end_dot_

 but he will have to choose which traditionally democratic demographic is most important to the future of the party working class whites who are increasingly siding with clinton and vulnerable to being picked off by mccain or african americans who side with obama in overwhelming numbers and have voted for the democratic presidential nominee nearly _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ in recent elections _meta_end_dot_

 efforts to resolve the dispute over michigan and florida have not been fruitful _meta_end_dot_

 clinton has not made life any easier for dean by reneging on her pledges not to appear on michigan s ballot and not to campaign in florida _meta_end_dot_

 her insistence on seating the two delegations in their entirety is the better principle for the democratic party to follow however _meta_end_dot_

 it avoids alienating voters in two critical states for the general election _meta_end_dot_

 that is especially true for michigan where democratic governance has led to a one state recession and an embarrassing spectacle in detroit _meta_end_dot_

 in the end dean will have to decide if the democratic party is a party built to win now or to carry a governing coalition into the future _meta_end_dot_

 by the end of this month we may know if the party s presidential nominating process will leave it hopelessly broken or just greatly weakened _meta_end_dot_
