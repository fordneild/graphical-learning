  the senate s most influential global warming bill is the lieberman warner global climate change bill a bill that claims to combat so called global warming _meta_end_dot_

 well it won t do much for global warming in fact nothing man can do can either cause or stop climate change but it will cost each and every person in the country more money in higher energy bills lost productivity and jobs as well as higher regulatory costs _meta_end_dot_

 so illinois where i am from let s say you have been bamboozled by this global warming hysteria _meta_end_dot_

 you say that you want lieberman warner to pass so that we can do something about your mythical global catastrophe you are so sure is coming _meta_end_dot_

 well open up you wallets and pay up because it s gonna cost you _meta_end_dot_

 let s start with your energy costs _meta_end_dot_

 by _meta_number_ref_ the lieberman warner bill will add _meta_dollor_ref_ dollars a year top your electric costs _meta_end_dot_

 natural gas prices will be artificially forced up _meta_dollor_ref_ and gasoline an additional _meta_dollor_ref_ dollars a year _meta_end_dot_

 now this will be on top of all the other price increases that will be naturally added to the costs of these products _meta_end_dot_

 the costs are based on current prices worse will be the loss of jobs _meta_end_dot_

 by _meta_number_ref_ over _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ jobs will be lost to the state of illinois because of lieberman warner _meta_end_dot_

 personal income will fall statewide by over _meta_number_ref_ million dollars _meta_end_dot_

 and this is just illinois _meta_end_dot_

 there are similar numbers of the loss in every state n the union _meta_end_dot_

 some states take an even bigger hit than illinois _meta_end_dot_

 so if you want to save the earth expect to be living in grass huts because the so called cure will send us all back to the dark ages _meta_end_dot_
