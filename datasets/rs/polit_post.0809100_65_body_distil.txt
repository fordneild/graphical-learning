  appearing on abc s this week senator joe lieberman the democratic party s vice presidential nominee in _meta_number_ref_ succinctly described the sad devolution of the democratic party michael scherer gets it very wrong when he attributes lieberman s critique to revenge against the antiwar radicals who rebelled against senator liberal during his reelection campaign in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 the senator was reelected because he taken a strong principled stand seeking victory in the war the islamic extremists continue to wage against america _meta_end_dot_

 it s really too bad the democratic party is now controlled by the same type of left wing liberal progressive radicals that tried and failed to defeat senator lieberman _meta_end_dot_

 lieberman s description of the small left wing cabal that has steered the democratic party away from kennedy s pay any price bear any burden is exactly right _meta_end_dot_

 he s my senator and i m glad he is _meta_end_dot_
