  dear governor huckabee you don t know me but i am your lone supporter among the contributors here at redstate _meta_end_dot_

 anyone who has read my posts on a regular basis understands that i support your candidacy primarily because i truly believe _meta_number_ref_ you are the most eloquent spokesman for a culture of life of all the presidential candidates and _meta_number_ref_ having a true blue social conservative as a top tier presidential candidate advances the pro life causes i care for so deeply _meta_end_dot_

 that having been said i am also a devout catholic and i have to say that i am troubled by your decision to preach to cornerstone church this coming sunday in san antonio texas a church pastored by a raving anti catholic bigot _meta_end_dot_

 don t get me wrong _meta_end_dot_

 i understand that a pastor s views should not be imputed to those who attend his church and that most of the good folks at cornerstone are almost certainly not anti catholic bigots _meta_end_dot_

 i am also well aware that other presidential candidates have spoken to anti catholic universities and churches in past elections _meta_end_dot_

 finally i am confident that your decision to preach to cornerstone is in no way meant to be an endorsement of this bigot s views _meta_end_dot_

 nevertheless i agree with k lo that you should cancel the appearance _meta_end_dot_

 it s a bad political move and it also sends mixed signals to your faithful catholic supporters _meta_end_dot_

 and if some of the good folks at cornerstone are upset by the decision well then so be it _meta_end_dot_

 be presidential _meta_end_dot_

 take a stand _meta_end_dot_

 let your catholic supporters know that pandering to bigots is not an acceptable vice even in presidential politics _meta_end_dot_

 if you aren t willing to stand up for a substantial block of your supporters then why should we do the same for you _meta_end_question_
