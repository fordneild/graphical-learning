  redstate s moe lane yesterday called readers attention to the growing concerns among fiscal conservatives that president bush might bow to pressure from capitol hill appropriators and back away from a fight over earmarks _meta_end_dot_

 i echo the fears expressed by moe captain ed and other conservatives the time is critical for bush to issue an executive order canceling earmarks _meta_end_dot_

 the president s tough talk about pork barrel spending in the wake of the mammoth omnibus was a great boost for fiscal conservatives but it also angered many earmark loving lawmakers on capitol hill including several republicans _meta_end_dot_

 they would prefer bush send congress a rescission package which would amount to a complete capitulation to washington s big spenders _meta_end_dot_

 republicans can no longer just talk a good game of fiscal restraint it s time to back it up with action _meta_end_dot_

 take the senate s top republican mitch mcconnell who was among the first to boast about the earmarks he secured for kentucky _meta_end_dot_

 his rhetoric about protecting their wallets and spending their money wisely was ridiculed by louisville columnist david hawpe who saw through mcconnell s doublespeak _meta_end_dot_

 bush can expect the same kind of treatment if his words turn out to be hollow _meta_end_dot_

 with so much media attention on the _meta_number_ref_ race it would be easy for the president to back away from a confrontation _meta_end_dot_

 but to do so would cement his legacy as a big government conservative _meta_end_dot_

 instead bush has the opportunity to make a lasting impact on washington by shutting down the favor factory and putting a stop to the corrupting influence of earmarks _meta_end_dot_
