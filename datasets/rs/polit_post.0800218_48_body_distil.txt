  yes it s a mccain for president ad but the mitt romney quote in the below video stands on its own both as a statement of future policy and as a powerful indictment against mitt romney s fitness to hold the office of president of the united states if we need foreign policy experience then we can go to the state department _meta_end_question_

 please read on _meta_end_dot_

 yes i understand that foreign policy diplomacy and international relations are combined the whole purpose for the state department s existence _meta_end_dot_

 however the dos is also currently and has been for the entirety of my memory the one us government organization that has done more to inhibit the implementation of needed us foreign policy adjustments than any other _meta_end_dot_

 most recently the dos has seemingly redefined its mission to include undermining a presidential administration which has been working feverishly to implement and execute a foreign policy which has as its supreme goal the protection of america and her interests _meta_end_dot_

 the department of state isn t a group or an organization that i personally would want my president touching with a _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ foot pole when it comes time to make decisions about us national security and real foreign policy _meta_end_dot_

 the fact that mitt romney would make such a statement demonstrates once again his business approach to government and why that approach while correct in many aspects is not a correct one for a president to take toward the entirety of government and of governing _meta_end_dot_

 much like using the marketing department for marketing within a business or the sales department to conduct sales romney appears to take the different apparati of government and their stated purposes at face value _meta_end_dot_

 the business manager in romney says if there s a governmental organization whose purpose is diplomacy and foreign policy then that s who should be relied on to conduct business and advise the ceo in that area this is a perfectly understandable view if the person making that statement is so removed from the reality of the dos and its subversive exploits that he honestly takes their mission statement at face value and thinks that they are effectively what they purport to be _meta_end_dot_

 the fact that this is true in the case of mitt romney is a powerful indictment on his fitness to be president in a post _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ world _meta_end_dot_
