  recall this _meta_end_dot_

 let s see how krugman has done on the predictability front with his latest article _meta_end_dot_

 first credit where it is due there actually is nothing in this article that echoes the we re heading into a recession ignore what i ve said before this time i m sure talking point krugman traditionally employs _meta_end_dot_

 kudos _meta_end_dot_

 it must have been difficult for krugman to veer from convention and ingrained habit _meta_end_dot_

 let s all give him a round of applause _meta_end_dot_

 done _meta_end_question_

 good _meta_end_dot_

 now on to this _meta_end_dot_

 read on _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 the republicans are blinkered check _meta_end_dot_

 pretty much the entire article satisfies the i luuuuuv john edwards talking point _meta_end_dot_

 a big ol check for that _meta_end_dot_

 check _meta_end_dot_

 so we haven t had the recession prediction _meta_end_dot_

 but doubtless it will come back soon _meta_end_dot_

 the only real question is how krugman will ensure that edwards s name remains in circulation despite the fact that he has withdrawn _meta_end_dot_

 i suppose that the best way to do that is to push for edwards as vice president despite the fact that edwards says that he doesn t want the job anymore and that if he took it again he would look like a perpetual second banana _meta_end_dot_

 but this probably won t matter to krugman _meta_end_dot_

 after all he has a formula for his columns _meta_end_dot_

 he won t want to deviate from that formula and be you know original _meta_end_dot_
