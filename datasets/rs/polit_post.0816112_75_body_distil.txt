  tacking on to erick s earlier piece it s worth noting this new york times article which points out that it s rural america that is taking the worst hit from gas prices there is an outstanding map that shows just how distinct the differences are between rural america and the rest of the country in terms of the percentage of income currently being spent on fuel _meta_end_dot_

 this is a must see graphic folks _meta_end_dot_

 what is amazing to me at least is the willingness of democrats from massachusetts to california to advocate bills energy and cap and trade for example that makes gas more expensive while simultaneously ignoring the plight of most american families those living outside large cities and those without access to mass transportation _meta_end_dot_

 look closely at the map then call your democrat political heroes and thank them for the pelosi premium not that they ll actually give a flip _meta_end_dot_
