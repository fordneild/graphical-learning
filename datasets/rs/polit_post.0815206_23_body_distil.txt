  we have been used to cia estimates and politicians who use those estimates for partisan purposes telling us that our actions are making terrorist groups like al qaeda stronger and more potent _meta_end_dot_

 such estimates have been the cause of huge amounts of policy alarmism when it comes to analyzing the war on terrorism _meta_end_dot_

 i presume then that the same people who have been so fond of telling us how much trouble we were in when any of these dark and forbidding intelligence estimates came out will now change their tune has been turned and i imagine that there will remain a very tough fight ahead _meta_end_dot_

 but it will be interesting to see whether the same people who embraced cia estimates when they gave us bad news will embrace this latest upbeat estimate _meta_end_dot_

 they should if they want to be consistent _meta_end_dot_

 but then consistency goes by the wayside when partisanship takes priority no _meta_end_question_
