 wade with a constitutional life amendment would be like allowing for _meta_number_ref_ different states to kill babies to their own degrees _meta_end_dot_

 thompson questioned which states would if freed from roe allow for abortion on demand and wallace had a gotcha moment the district of columbia did pre roe _meta_end_dot_

 he pointed out as he had at some point in the very distant past that there are no thomas jeffersons in iraq _meta_end_dot_

 saddam killed them all steph played a clip of bill richardson at some dem debate blaming halliburton for this that and the other while talking about how we should trade no human rights for any national security _meta_end_dot_
