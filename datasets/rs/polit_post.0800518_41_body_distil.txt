  i just got to a computer after john mccain s most recent townhall in peterborough in western new hampshire _meta_end_dot_

 peterborough was the location of mccain s famous _meta_number_ref_ town hall meeting that become a cover story in time magazine _meta_end_dot_

 this year it was mccain s _meta_number_ref_th town hall in new hampshire _meta_end_dot_

 apparently _meta_number_ref_ showed up to standing room only _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ more were turned away by the fire marshall _meta_end_dot_

 ramesh was there _meta_end_dot_

 so was phil _meta_end_dot_

 read on _meta_end_dot_

 so was cbn s david brody who should have some great video _meta_end_dot_

 but here s what he blogged it appears that something may be happening _meta_end_dot_

 the concord monitor has a new poll out with mccain up _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 if this energy continues the mac may well be back _meta_end_dot_

 with that i go to nro s event and then the debate _meta_end_dot_

 details will follow _meta_end_dot_
