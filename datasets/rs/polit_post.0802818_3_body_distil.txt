  the white house came out today against earmarks _meta_end_dot_

 more or less _meta_end_dot_

 more details here _meta_end_dot_

 read on _meta_end_dot_

 as per mark i this isn t quite what we asked for see here and here for background _meta_end_dot_

 the idea was to have this year s earmarks limited to ones actually legislated this eo merely limits all future earmarks _meta_end_dot_

 this doesn t mean that this is meaningless the _meta_number_ref_ budget will be affected by both this and the associated veto threat noted here but neither will it provoke the immediate debate on governmental spending habits that the country in general and congress in particular needs right now _meta_end_dot_

 it s at times like this that i m reminded of the famous analogy of politics and sausage making _meta_end_dot_

 a bush staffer if we had one hanging around right now would probably at this point be reminding us that the president is not precisely an absolute monarch and is thus constrained by a constant awareness that there is a gulf between what he can theoretically do and what he can get away with _meta_end_dot_

 it s actually a good point but it still doesn t help us get rid of the stupid earmarks currently there which was the point of the exercise _meta_end_dot_

 still all in all at least now we will have some brakes on the earmark process in the future _meta_end_dot_

 well until we have a democratic president in office of course _meta_end_dot_
