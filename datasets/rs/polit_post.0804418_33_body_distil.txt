  clinton hillary supporter and pennsylvania governor ed rendell a one time dnc chairman and mayor of philadelphia has accused conservatives of being racist pigs the reason conservative whites would not vote for obama has nothing to do with the color of his skin rather it is that he is a vacuous liberal _meta_end_dot_

 we can however ask ed why he supported hillary over barry _meta_end_dot_

 is it that there is the white who is probably not ready to vote for an african american candidate _meta_end_question_

 is the projecting himself onto his favorite target pennsylvania conservatives _meta_end_question_

 read more ed of course had more to say ed rendell did not call obama clean either as did joe biden last year _meta_end_dot_

 look at this numbers _meta_end_dot_

 swann s race in _meta_number_ref_ cost the candidate _meta_percent_ref_ rendell posits which means that _meta_percent_ref_ of the electorate in _meta_number_ref_ pennsylvania was racist _meta_end_dot_

 have we got a klan problem in pennsylvania _meta_end_question_

 of course not but that s quite a thing for a governor to insist when he wants business to relocate within the commonwealth _meta_end_dot_

 and it s quite a thing to say about himself that he received the votes of the _meta_percent_ref_ of the electorate who are racist members of the ku klux klowns no the only klown is the racist rendell who has injected race into the possibly meaningful april _meta_number_ref_ pennsylvania dem primary to convince dem voters that obama is a lost cause _meta_end_dot_
