  hey i m not the only one who thinks that _meta_end_dot_

 the ibd stopped just short of calling for senator byrd to wake up tomorrow with a horse s head in his bed via captain ed read on _meta_end_dot_

 the captain goes on to suggest either the iowa caucuses or the state of the union speech for bush to make the announcement _meta_end_dot_

 i m torn on that myself the earlier the better _meta_end_dot_

 but the image of the president telling congress that this is going down and then the panicky looks as _meta_number_ref_ legislators realize that the cameras are on them and they had better start clapping if they don t want this showing up in a campaign ad _meta_end_dot_

 let us savor that image for a moment _meta_end_dot_

 pause moving on as a practical matter ed s right there s almost no downside for the president for this one _meta_end_dot_

 granted it s only nationally that americans hate pork we happily forgive our local porkers _meta_end_dot_

 it s still true that we nationally hate pork and the news that the president is doing something to counteract it will help hearten fiscal conservatives who have been taking a lot of beatings for the party s sake these last seven years _meta_end_dot_

 true it ll mean that the next congressional session will make this one look like the new deal s first _meta_number_ref_ days which will just break conservative hearts won t it _meta_end_question_

 and put some freshmen congressmen in opposite color districts at risk because they aren t showing that they re good providers but that s about it _meta_end_dot_

 oh right all of those freshmen are democrats trying to keep their seats in republican districts _meta_end_dot_

 you re a baseball man mr _meta_end_dot_

 president so i hardly need to tell you about the tactical uses of the beanball do i _meta_end_question_
