 jeb hensarling _meta_end_dot_

 the purpose was to lay out the republican leadership s strategy for dealing with the omnibus appropriations bill working its way through congress _meta_end_dot_

 last night the cantankerous democratic chairman of the house appropriations committee david obey d wi threatened to pull all earmarks out of the bill unless republicans agreed to negotiate on spending levels _meta_end_dot_

 the white house called obey s bluff and said that it s position on funding for domestic programs had not changed _meta_end_dot_

 blunt and hensarling wanted to make it clear to the assembled journalists and bloggers that republicans has gotten the message on spending and intended on the house side at least to hold democrats to their campaign pledges of fiscal responsibility _meta_end_dot_

 blunt was asked how well he thought the republican caucus would hold together in light of comments made by more moderate members in the washington post _meta_end_dot_

 rep _meta_end_dot_

 ray lahood r il said there are a lot of people who were very disappointed last year when nobody got any earmarks _meta_end_dot_

 if they do it again for the second year in a row it will be a very bitter pill to swallow rep _meta_end_dot_

 jim walsh r ny took to the house floor and said if the proposal is to split the difference to reduce the amount of spending above the president s request by _meta_dollor_ref_ billion i would advise the president to take yes for an answer the congressmen s comments seem to show daylight between the leadership and its desire to re brand the party as fiscally responsible and rank and file members _meta_end_dot_

 blunt s assessment was optimistic _meta_end_dot_

 this is welcome rhetoric from the leadership and the kind that would have served them well when republicans were in the majority _meta_end_dot_

 in addition to the spending levels blunt and hensarling focused attention on authorizing policies in the appropriations bill _meta_end_dot_

 blunt said that these policies which direct spending to or from certain programs were just as important as the overall budget number _meta_end_dot_

 he pointed to policies in the democrats bill that would make it more difficult to build a border fence put the mexico city policy which prohibits funding for overseas family planning groups that counsel abortion in jeopardy and hurt the nation s ability to pursue energy independence _meta_end_dot_

 hensarling added that the republicans goal was to reach the president s budget requests with a good bill he said that money was not the only priority on the republicans agenda _meta_end_dot_

 blunt summed up by characterizing the democrats as reach ing beyond the american people with their spending requests and authorizing policies in the appropriations bill _meta_end_dot_

 he predicted that next week would be one of good results on the bill and even predicted that funding for the troops would be included in the deal either as a separate package or in the final appropriation _meta_end_dot_

 unless democrats want to spend the entire month of january explaining why the troops were not funded he said _meta_end_dot_
