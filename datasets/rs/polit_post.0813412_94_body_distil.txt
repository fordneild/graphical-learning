  mike huckabee ran a christmas time commercial in iowa that had a subliminal cross in it _meta_end_dot_

 remember that _meta_end_question_

 it was a bookshelf _meta_end_dot_

 the media went nuts _meta_end_dot_

 he s using religion to get votes the msm said _meta_end_dot_

 that s disgusting that s a violation of the separation of church and state the msm continued _meta_end_dot_

 for days the media more so than any candidate blasted huckabee for daring to do a christmas ad with a bookshelf that looked like a cross _meta_end_dot_

 since we haven t heard any outrage about this from the msm i guess they re all burned out of anti religion vitriol _meta_end_dot_
