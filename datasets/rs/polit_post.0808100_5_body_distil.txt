  promoted from blogs with a notation this must be the single silliest suggestion that we have seen so far from the democratic party on how to solve their primary problem _meta_end_dot_

 i mean _meta_end_dot_

 really _meta_end_dot_

 they want to take the nomination away from the first female african american mainstream candidate for president and give it to an old white guy _meta_end_question_

 pause um thanks _meta_end_question_

 moe lane john zogby the pollster who runs zogby international said today on the hannity radio program that there are rumors that top ranking democrats are talking about having obama give his delegates to al gore _meta_end_dot_

 he said obama would have to offer these delegates since he s in the lead and the thinking seems to be that gore will have more appeal to white male voters and that gore will likely be able to hold on to the support of clinton supporters since these are core democratic voters _meta_end_dot_

 he said that hillary and obama would be given either the vp position high level cabinet positions or the senate majority position or something along those lines in order to make their voters happy _meta_end_dot_

 zogby s polling is very good but his verbal predictions have been way off sometimes like with the _meta_number_ref_ election _meta_end_dot_

 scott rasmussen also on the show seemed a bit skeptical that it would work given the historic nature of this race of having the first black or first female president _meta_end_dot_

 this may be true because zogby as far as i know has a lot of connections to the democratic party and either way it seems like the democratic party is not that concerned with disenfranchising some democratic voters anyway _meta_end_dot_

 he said that if this battle b n obama and hillary goes on which it probably will that this is the one thing that can save the party _meta_end_dot_

 it sounds crazy but the gop needs to keep their eyes open for this one _meta_end_dot_
