  pejman yousefzadeh did a good job covering a report on abc news that joint chiefs chairman adm _meta_end_dot_

 michael mullen issued a warning to the democratic presidential candidates not to pull out of iraq too fast _meta_end_dot_

 mullen was quoted saying i also covered the story for aol s the political machine _meta_end_dot_

 mullen s staff has now responded to that story and rejected the characterization that the chairman was issuing a warning to the democratic candidates _meta_end_dot_

 read on _meta_end_dot_

 in my aol piece i characterized mullen s comments about a precipitous pullout from iraq as something of a reversal for the joint chiefs of staff _meta_end_dot_

 earlier this month marine commandant gen _meta_end_dot_

 james conway and army chief gen _meta_end_dot_

 george casey both jcs members made public comments opposing iraq commander gen _meta_end_dot_

 david petraeus s plan to conduct a strategic assessment this summer pausing the troop drawdown _meta_end_dot_

 capt _meta_end_dot_

 john f _meta_end_dot_

 kirby special assistant to the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff for public affairs responded to that characterization _meta_end_dot_

 the characterizations of adm _meta_end_dot_

 mullen s position made in my aol article are based on media reports of a dispute between the chiefs and gen _meta_end_dot_

 petraeus _meta_end_dot_

 published reports of defense secretary robert gates decision to back gen _meta_end_dot_

 petraeus s plan also contained assertions that the joint chiefs as a whole were opposed to the idea _meta_end_dot_

 while i recognize that neither my aol article on that dispute nor the media source i cited contained a direct quote on the pause from adm _meta_end_dot_

 mullen the washington post did quote him as having a different perspective than petraeus on the pause _meta_end_dot_

 in addition gen _meta_end_dot_

 conway and gen _meta_end_dot_

 casey were quoted in the same article directly opposing the pause out of concern for the welfare of the armed forces _meta_end_dot_

 in light of those comments i think the characterization of a reversal in position by the jcs with respect to the pause is warranted _meta_end_dot_

 i recognize that adm _meta_end_dot_

 mullen is not engaging in the presidential primaries with his response to the abc news reporter s question and it was not my intention to put words in the chairman s mouth _meta_end_dot_

 i did quote the chairman whose term will extend into the next administration republican or democrat as saying that he will follow whatever orders the new president gives him _meta_end_dot_

 however it is unquestionably true that a victory by sen _meta_end_dot_

 clinton or sen _meta_end_dot_

 obama in the general election would result in a pull out order whereas a victory for sen _meta_end_dot_

 mccain would not _meta_end_dot_

 therefore i stand by the article s assertion that adm _meta_end_dot_

 mullen s comments can be interpreted as particularly directed at the democratic candidates _meta_end_dot_
