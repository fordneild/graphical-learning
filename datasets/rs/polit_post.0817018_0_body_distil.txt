  reporters are beginning to notice something quite disturbing _meta_end_dot_

 either barack obama didn t understand what iraqi foreign minister hoshyar zebari was saying obama is lying about the meeting or zebari is lying _meta_end_dot_

 however we have no reason to think that zebari would be lying while there is a pattern of obama at least obscuring the truth about his iraq position again think samantha powers just as he is doing on trade think austen goolsbee _meta_end_dot_

 or he could just be ignorant about what he is talking about which has become the obama s campaign s defense about his jerusalem undivided flip flop under palestinian pressure _meta_end_dot_

 so which is it _meta_end_question_

 abc s jake tapper in a post entitled obama and iraqi foreign minister have different memories of their conversation recounts asking obama about this zebari told the washington post via the democratic strategist so is barack obama planning to be responsible but lying about it for political advantage _meta_end_question_

 or is he just talking about things that he doesn t understand _meta_end_question_

 both of these have scenarios have precedents in his campaign _meta_end_dot_

 hopefully the press will help us figure it out _meta_end_dot_

 but i kind of doubt it _meta_end_dot_
