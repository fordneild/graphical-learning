  as the us dollar weakens other currencies necessarily increase _meta_end_dot_

 the euro is now trading above _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ to the dollar a record high _meta_end_dot_

 and the japanese yen is stronger than _meta_number_ref_ to the dollar a two year high _meta_end_dot_

 all currency movements proximately reflect differentials in short term interest rates _meta_end_dot_

 the weakness in the dollar over the last two months was caused by the federal reserve s interest rate cuts in september and october _meta_end_dot_

 underlying economic fundamentals in each respective currency zone also affect exchange rates since they have an impact on market interest rates as well as policy interest rates _meta_end_dot_

 speaking very broadly a lower currency value can reflect concern about the business outlook for a particular country _meta_end_dot_

 this analysis holds reasonably well for the dollar euro rate _meta_end_dot_

 but what s the story with the japanese yen _meta_end_question_

 more _meta_end_dot_

 the domestic japanese economy is near comatose and has been for _meta_number_ref_ years _meta_end_dot_

 you probably remember a lot of unpleasantness about an asset bubble over there which happened when the reagan administration forced japan to allow the yen to almost double in value against the dollar _meta_end_dot_

 back in the mid eighties every day had a news story about how the strong dollar was killing us exporters and allowing japan to steal all of our precious manufacturing jobs to address the economic coma that followed when the bubble popped in the early nineties japan s government went on a multiyear binge of deficit spending _meta_end_dot_

 if you thought we build bridges to nowhere take a look at some of the insane projects they ve built in rural japan _meta_end_dot_

 they now have by far the highest national debt in the world more than twice as high as ours as a percentage of gdp _meta_end_dot_

 didn t help _meta_end_dot_

 nothing has helped _meta_end_dot_

 not even real interest rates that are by far the lowest among large economies and at times have even been negative _meta_end_dot_

 today like every major economy in the world except the united states japan is suffering the effects of inflation showing up mostly in commodity and food prices _meta_end_dot_

 as in europe this makes it hard for the bank of japan to lower interest rates although the boj actually would prefer to increase rates from their current _meta_number_ref_ _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 the comparable policy rate in the us after two cuts is _meta_number_ref_ _meta_percent_ref_ and the euro rate is _meta_percent_ref_ as in most asian countries japan s banking and financial systems are not quite squeaky clean _meta_end_dot_

 the boj isn t as independent as a central bank ought to be and they regularly come under political pressure to keep interest rates low _meta_end_dot_

 this was especially in evidence in the last few months as the country went through one of its periodic political convulsions _meta_end_dot_

 all of this results in an intriguing financial phenomenon called the carry trade _meta_end_dot_

 you can think of it as an interest rate arbitrage _meta_end_dot_

 typically you go to japan and borrow a lot of money at their microscopic interest rates _meta_end_dot_

 then you turn around and go to a high rate country like australia new zealand south africa or iceland and lend it to the local government or businesses _meta_end_dot_

 you put the interest rate differential in your pocket and life is good so long as the relative exchange rates remain favorable _meta_end_dot_

 remember when you unwind the carry trade you have to buy yen at the current market rate in order to repay what you borrowed _meta_end_dot_

 if the yen has strengthened in the interim you re in a lot of trouble _meta_end_dot_

 no problem there s such a thing as financial engineering _meta_end_dot_

 you simply hedge your currency exposure with derivatives _meta_end_dot_

 ok that works _meta_end_dot_

 except in times of high market volatility which makes options much more expensive _meta_end_dot_

 and guess what _meta_end_question_

 we re now in the longest period of extremely high volatility that i can remember _meta_end_dot_

 bottom line the carry trade has been less attractive than usual on most days for several months now and this adds upward pressure to the value of the yen _meta_end_dot_

 so even though the domestic economy in japan is generally weak there have been a few signs of strength recently the bias in the yen is not as weak as it might otherwise have been _meta_end_dot_

 combined with the perfect storm that has been knocking the dollar down this makes life difficult for japanese exporters _meta_end_dot_

 in fact companies like honda and sony that earn a majority of their profits in north america have been hit hard _meta_end_dot_

 as their earnings have fallen their stock prices have taken it on the chin _meta_end_dot_

 but how will japanese companies react to this situation as a whole _meta_end_question_

 japan is still a major exporter to china india europe and elsewhere _meta_end_dot_

 one doesn t normally think of flexibility as a hallmark of japan s economy that s more a quality you associate with ours _meta_end_dot_

 but there are some indications that the japanese are successfully transitioning their export productivity away from weak us markets and toward stronger markets elsewhere _meta_end_dot_

 the yen s recent strength puts japan at a disadvantage exporting to the us on top of decreased us demand _meta_end_dot_

 but this effect is much less pronounced against the euro which has also been strengthening _meta_end_dot_

 and the chinese yuan has been appreciating just a little bit faster too if the trend is real and it holds up expect the japanese to emerge from the current period of us weakness in not particularly bad shape _meta_end_dot_

 i ll close by asking a question that is something of a stretch _meta_end_dot_

 risk free interest rates in the us are now extraordinarily low across the yield curve and in fact they re going lower _meta_end_dot_

 our rates are still hundreds of basis points higher than japan s _meta_end_dot_

 but is it at all possible that we are entering a multi year period of low domestic growth together with extremely high but easily sustainable government deficits _meta_end_question_

 in short a mild form of the economic disease japan has suffered from for almost two decades _meta_end_question_

 if the federal reserve is forced to reverse their current stance and keep cutting us rates then this case becomes credible _meta_end_dot_

 unlike the yen rate story the yuan story is about international politics _meta_end_dot_

 the chinese will let their currency appreciate just enough to forestall trade war and not a bit more _meta_end_dot_
