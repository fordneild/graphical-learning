  i am going to be a little deliberately provocative and speculative _meta_end_dot_

 barack obama puts urban white ethnic voters in play in a way that we may not have seen in our lifetime indeed in our parents lifetimes in many places _meta_end_dot_

 look at two maps of philadelphia _meta_end_dot_

 the first one is the results of yesterday s primary _meta_end_dot_

 the second one is a map of the city that marks the density of african american vote _meta_end_dot_

 i urge you to click on the results map and look at the ward by ward results _meta_end_dot_

 the key observation is that obama is winning _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ or more in black wards _meta_end_dot_

 and clinton is winning _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ in white wards _meta_end_dot_

 the areas that clinton won have either republican or organizations on the ground primarily northeast philly or have demonstrated willingness to support republicans the south philly wards overlapping with retiring state sen _meta_end_dot_

 vince fumo s d district in which rick santorum had performed well prior to _meta_number_ref_ we can convert these _meta_end_dot_

 read on _meta_end_dot_

 first some demographics _meta_end_dot_

 both ne and s philly are highly catholic _meta_end_dot_

 hillary won catholics _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 in our primary john mccain won with a coalition that included substantial catholic turnout _meta_end_dot_

 second these areas have voted for republicans in the past _meta_end_dot_

 northeast philly has a republican machine that delivers state representatives including the last two speakers of the pa house of representatives against democrats _meta_end_dot_

 local republican precinct captains have existing relationships with both the local democratic organization and the local democratic voters _meta_end_dot_

 these are small precincts with _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ voters _meta_end_dot_

 the local republican precinct captains know the voters _meta_end_dot_

 they know who they can talk to _meta_end_dot_

 and they have _meta_number_ref_ months to have those discussions _meta_end_dot_

 i can assure you that every bitter cling comment every bill ayers like associate or every jeremiah wright comment will get communicated over beer or coffee or donuts or something _meta_end_dot_

 similarly in south philly you have lots of traditionalist catholics _meta_end_dot_

 they voted for santorum _meta_end_dot_

 third there is resentment at the out of touchness of rich liberals which obama looks like _meta_end_dot_

 mythical new york city community organizer michael gecan wrote in the village voice he also points out that some republicans have figured out how to organize this crowd gecan wrote in the washington post think back to what i said about northeast philly _meta_end_dot_

 we have an existing republican machine that knows how to talk to people _meta_end_dot_

 in south philly perhaps a vet in his _meta_number_ref_s who is inspired by mccain s service and goes to church and drinks at the bar with people can talk to people _meta_end_dot_

 and he can cooperate with the church ladies _meta_end_dot_

 fourth there is a real sense that people don t connect to obama _meta_end_dot_

 back to the exit polls _meta_end_dot_

 one third of voters yesterday including about half of clinton s voters do not believe that is obama in touch with people like you _meta_end_dot_

 and fifth race will indeed matter _meta_end_dot_

 back to those exits _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_percent_ref_ of white voters said that race mattered to their vote _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_percent_ref_ of those people voted for clinton _meta_end_dot_

 let me repeat that with slightly different words _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_percent_ref_ of pennsylvania democrats publicly tied their support for clinton to barack obama s race _meta_end_dot_

 we all suspect that the numbers are higher than that _meta_end_dot_

 roger simon has a very interesting piece at the politico about this _meta_end_dot_

 it looks like this might be replicable in other parts of the state _meta_end_dot_

 watching msnbc we see chuck todd and scarborough repeating eddy rendell s pride at winning lackawanna county which contains scranton pro life bob casey s home town _meta_end_dot_

 clinton won scranton _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 or pro life veteran hillary clinton endorsing jack murtha s washington county _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 it s not a mistake that there are either a lot of vets there or that murtha is pro life _meta_end_dot_

 he s not the only one and mccain can win these _meta_end_dot_

 btw washington county is the home county of pa gop s chairman gleason who would love to deliver it and it could be replicable in ohio _meta_end_dot_

 or new jersey _meta_end_dot_

 or gecan s brooklyn _meta_end_dot_

 or massachusetts _meta_end_dot_

 or rhode island _meta_end_dot_

 or working class connecticut _meta_end_dot_

 the parts that joe lieberman won _meta_end_dot_

 or macomb county in michigan _meta_end_dot_

 we may be looking at the realignment that puts the northeast and the rust belt back in play _meta_end_dot_

 also and many readers know that i was no fan of mitt romney s _meta_end_dot_

 but can you imagine a guy with _meta_dollor_ref_m winning in northeast philly and connecting with these voters in the way that mccain might _meta_end_question_
