  most americans will vote for either john mccain or barack obama on november _meta_number_ref_th which means that most americans will vote for a lefty _meta_end_dot_

 no matter what the rhetoric flying from either campaign both mccain and obama are unapologetic lefties _meta_end_dot_

 and this is not necessarily a bad thing _meta_end_dot_

 bear with me _meta_end_dot_

 both presidents reagan and clinton were also lefties _meta_end_dot_

 jimmy carter _meta_end_question_

 aside from our current president he was the last righty to be elected _meta_end_dot_

 it is evidently true _meta_end_dot_

 lefties comprise about _meta_percent_ref_ of the population while including the next president _meta_number_ref_ presidents of seven since _meta_number_ref_ will have been lefties _meta_end_dot_

 i write pitch and bat with my right hand so i think i ll sit this presidential election out _meta_end_dot_

 concentrate on down ballot stuff where we have some decent right handed candidates _meta_end_dot_
