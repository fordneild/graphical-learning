  senator mccain is quoted as having said in a television interview that speculators have contributed to the recent high prices for crude oil _meta_end_dot_

 mccain acknowledges that he can t judge how big the effect of speculation is _meta_end_dot_

 very few people actually know the answer to the question and they re not talking _meta_end_dot_

 mccain also believes there should be a thorough investigation _meta_end_dot_

 ok fine let s convene a blue ribbon panel and buy them some expensive lunches and air travel so they can produce a report three years from now that no one will read and contains no action items anyway _meta_end_dot_

 until then let me fill you in a bit _meta_end_dot_

 keep reading crude oil is a commodity that combines very large size trillions of dollars per year with excellent liquidity on futures markets and is in demand _meta_end_dot_

 global demand for crude oil is at least stable it s falling in the developed countries but rising like a rocket in asia and the middle east _meta_end_dot_

 that puts a floor under the crude price in the near term _meta_end_dot_

 as a result crude oil has taken on many of the characteristics of an asset class the kind of thing that investors buy in addition to an industrial commodity _meta_end_dot_

 and as an asset oil is very attractive because it acts as a hedge against inflation _meta_end_dot_

 why are investors buying an industrial commodity instead of the fixed income securities they usually buy _meta_end_question_

 simple _meta_end_dot_

 because there s still a huge amount of sovereign money in the world what ben bernanke calls the savings glut and it tends to migrate into us treasury debt _meta_end_dot_

 that raises the price and lowers the yield _meta_end_dot_

 over the last five years the low yields available to global investors were one of the factors that attracted them to invest heavily in the us mortgage market _meta_end_dot_

 well we know how that ended up _meta_end_dot_

 today s reality is that investors have largely shunned all but the safest debt and are demanding relatively high yields for most corporate debt _meta_end_dot_

 that means that there is a supply shortage in the market for investment securities _meta_end_dot_

 that s one of the reasons that investors aka speculators are piling into crude oil _meta_end_dot_

 broad uncertainty over the direction of the global economy is another reason _meta_end_dot_

 and momentum is yet another _meta_end_dot_

 whenever something is going up in price it will tend to keep going up because everyone tends to follow the herd ok all of that sounds at least coherent _meta_end_dot_

 how can you go and confirm it _meta_end_question_

 well you could look at the net purchases of crude oil futures contracts and compare them to what we estimate that industry actually needs to make gasoline heating oil jet fuel petrochemical feedstocks and windfall profits _meta_end_dot_

 just kidding about the last one as an aside i ve read in several very prestigious financial newspapers that financial buying of oil futures can t affect the price because futures are zero sum every open contract must eventually be offset by a close _meta_end_dot_

 you ll often hear this expressed as you can t buy more oil than can actually be delivered but that ignores the fact that people can and do roll their expiring contracts forward into subsequent months _meta_end_dot_

 if forward purchases significantly exceed industrial demand that s pretty good evidence of the existence of paper barrels or speculative pressure on the oil price _meta_end_dot_

 well the commodities and futures trading commission has all those figures don t they _meta_end_question_

 ummm not quite _meta_end_dot_

 yes the cftc publishes a weekly open position report on trading in all regulated commodities _meta_end_dot_

 but it turns out that you can buy and sell crude oil futures even for accounts domiciled in the us without needing to report your trades to the cftc _meta_end_dot_

 you just go through the london intercontinental exchange _meta_end_dot_

 there is significant anecdotal evidence that some of the household name firms on wall street have crude oil trading desks that are doing just this _meta_end_dot_

 that s a huge amount of activity that may be adding _meta_dollor_ref_ dollars or more to the price of every barrel of crude oil _meta_end_dot_

 so one big problem is that we have no real visibility into the extent of this trading _meta_end_dot_

 this is a data problem that could be solved with an overhaul of cftc regulations _meta_end_dot_

 and watch very carefully which ceo pops his head up to howl about it that s how you ll know which firms are raking in the megabucks from oil speculation now what if you decided to actually curtail crude oil speculation _meta_end_question_

 well that s a much bigger issue _meta_end_dot_

 global capital is flowing into crude oil because there are limits on where else it can go _meta_end_dot_

 the fundamental problem that results in expensive crude oil is located in the credit and money markets not the crude oil markets _meta_end_dot_

 crude oil is working as a safety valve _meta_end_dot_

 solve the credit money problem and the price of crude will collapse right back to perhaps _meta_number_ref_ or _meta_number_ref_ dollars a barrel where supply and demand say it should be _meta_end_dot_

 but take away the safety valve by restricting speculation and all hell will break loose _meta_end_dot_

 my swag is that you d see a sharp steepening of the yield curve with the potential for a repeat of the money market trauma that took place last march and april after the bear stearns collapse _meta_end_dot_
