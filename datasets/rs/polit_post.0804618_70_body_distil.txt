  i just got off the house floor after engaging majority leader steny hoyer regarding the latest extremely negligent actions of the democrat leadership _meta_end_dot_

 the clock displayed on this page is real _meta_end_dot_

 at midnight tonight the protect america act will expire and a serious lapse in america s intelligence gathering capabilities will be realized _meta_end_dot_

 yet democrats in congress just recessed the house for _meta_number_ref_ days without acting to permanently authorize an essential national security law _meta_end_dot_

 this is the same authority that has provided our intelligence community with invaluable tools used to identify and disrupt numerous terrorist plots _meta_end_dot_

 democrats have known that this law was going to expire for more than six months yet continue to drop the ball on our national security _meta_end_dot_

 first they secured a two week fix and this week sought another _meta_number_ref_ day extension _meta_end_dot_

 the ability of our intelligence community to protect us from threats should not be treated with temporary stop gap extensions _meta_end_dot_

 republicans in the house are resolute in our demand for permanent solutions instead of reckless week by week extensions _meta_end_dot_

 rather than working together and allowing a vote on the new protect america act which the majority of the house is on record supporting the democrat leadership in the house is disregarding their solemn oath to defend the american people and abdicating their constitutional responsibilities _meta_end_dot_

 this bill is ready and waiting for bipartisan passage to send to the president but the new majority decided a better use of their time was to leave town early with a brazen disregard for the seriousness of the terrorist threat _meta_end_dot_

 the speaker must call the house back into session to ensure our intelligence agencies have the tools needed to keep us safe _meta_end_dot_
