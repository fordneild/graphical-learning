  before congress gets on its high horse again about china stealing american intellectual property perhaps it or the courts ought to crack down on little china a k a the state of california _meta_end_dot_

 it ll be pretty darn hard for us to maintain our credibility otherwise _meta_end_dot_

 here s the deal _meta_end_dot_

 there is a case working its way to the u s _meta_end_dot_

 supreme court right now called biomedical patent management corporation bpmc v _meta_end_dot_

 california department of health services _meta_end_dot_

 the procedural background is not that important for our purposes but to give you some california moved a lawsuit filed against it by bpmc for patent infringement to federal court _meta_end_dot_

 the case was dismissed on venue grounds and re filed _meta_end_dot_

 the second time california claimed it had sovereign immunity and could not be sued on the matter _meta_end_dot_

 here s the funny party _meta_end_dot_

 since _meta_number_ref_ california has filed _meta_number_ref_ patent suits against companies and individuals the state claims have infringed on patents held by the state of california _meta_end_dot_

 from _meta_number_ref_ to _meta_number_ref_ california has collected over _meta_dollor_ref_ million from patent lawsuits _meta_end_dot_

 since _meta_number_ref_ california has been sued at least six times for infringing on the patents of others and it has invoked sovereign immunity thereby avoiding the lawsuits _meta_end_dot_

 there is no doubt that california has infringed on many other patents but the patent holders did not like their odds in court and walked away without suing _meta_end_dot_

 in other words the state is competing with the private sector through its university research facilities infringing on private sector patents then screaming about sovereign immunity when the private sector seeks to enforce its patent rights _meta_end_dot_

 now here s where it gets even more humorous or disgusting depending on your point of view _meta_end_dot_

 bpmc holds a patent for a non invasive prenatal screening for fetal abnormalities _meta_end_dot_

 it has licensed its patent to places like the mayo clinic and a host of other facilities _meta_end_dot_

 california s department of health services uses bpmc s patented process _meta_end_dot_

 not only will the department of health services not pay bpmc a license but it is requiring any other person in the state who wants to use bpmc s patented procedure to pay a license to naturally the state of california shutting bpmc out of its own patent _meta_end_dot_

 if the supreme court won t stop california from behaving like communist china congress must act _meta_end_dot_

 california s contempt for the free market must be stopped _meta_end_dot_
