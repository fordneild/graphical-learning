  a quite nefarious one in fact and never mind what ace said it s just not our plot _meta_end_dot_

 read on _meta_end_dot_

 let us dispense with the suggestion that this is due to the gop in two words state _meta_end_dot_

 department _meta_end_dot_

 yes pretty much torpedoes that one right below the waterline doesn t it _meta_end_question_

 trust me our only evil evvvvillll conspiracy involving state involves eliminating it entirely and breaking out its functions among commerce defense and the national endowment of the arts we figure giving _meta_percent_ref_ of state s budget to the latter will be enough of a bribe to placate the democrats _meta_end_dot_

 those guys wouldn t urinate on us if we were on fire _meta_end_dot_

 but i digress _meta_end_dot_

 anyway ain t us and it ain t hillary the way obama s been cratering lately she doesn t have much of a need so who was it _meta_end_question_

 why isn t it obvious _meta_end_question_

 al gore _meta_end_dot_

 obama s delegates he wants them he does _meta_end_dot_

 and he s lurking in the shadow s right now setting in motion his plan to take them away from barack obama _meta_end_dot_

 sure laugh now _meta_end_dot_

 but when you and barry are lying there bleeding in the street while al gore is leading away your precious delegates to his glorious and epic defeat at the hands of john mccain well _meta_end_dot_

 you ll be laughing out of the other side of your mouth then let me tell you _meta_end_dot_

 and you ll wish that you had listened to me _meta_end_dot_

 moe lane ps no i don t know how passport information would be so critically useful to al gore s plan _meta_end_dot_

 then again i really can t think of why it d be so critically useful to any of the actual campaigns either and the nice thing about al gore is that he s just barking mad these days is a perfectly good explanation for anything he does _meta_end_dot_
