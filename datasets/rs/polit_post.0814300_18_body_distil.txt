  the media research center has a long list of documents showing linda douglass has always been a democrat hack inside the msm _meta_end_dot_

 here s one of my favorites from way back in _meta_number_ref_ on hillarycare as recently as december she was in favor of asking people who submit questions for debates what their partisan affiliation was _meta_end_dot_

 i m sure she did not want to be asked though _meta_end_dot_

 in _meta_number_ref_ she parroted without question democrat talking points on the bush tax cuts _meta_end_dot_

 play down sandy burglar s theft and destruction of classified documents _meta_end_dot_

 she also has a history of fawning over nancy pelosi _meta_end_dot_

 next time a reporter claims objectivity just remember linda douglass did too _meta_end_dot_

 and given the fawning uncritical coverage of obama lately you can bet we ll see more journalists crossing into campaign hackdom on his behalf _meta_end_dot_
