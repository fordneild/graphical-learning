  anyone who thinks that foreign policy is not going to be a big issue in the upcoming presidential campaign has likely had his her world rocked by the assassination of benazir bhutto today read on _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 the assassination has thrown pakistan into chaos _meta_end_dot_

 of course now we are confronted with questions concerning the identity and associations of the attackers _meta_end_dot_

 it would not surprise me in the least to find out as this story speculates that al qaeda was indeed involved _meta_end_dot_

 and with nawaz sharif s threat to boycott the upcoming elections and demand that pervez musharraf resign pakistan will be thrown into still greater social and political disorder _meta_end_dot_

 in the event that it has been forgotten let us now remember and resolve to bear in mind that we live in a tremendously dangerous world that random acts of violence can dramatically alter the geopolitical landscape especially when those random acts of violence take place in a country with nuclear weapons and that unless foreign policy and national security receive heavy and pronounced attention in the ordering of any nation s priorities we will be manifestly unprepared to deal with crises and disasters _meta_end_dot_

 the events in pakistan will rightfully keep us on edge for some time to come _meta_end_dot_

 for all of the right reasons it is now a major issue in any discussion of the foreign policy landscape _meta_end_dot_

 and instead of asking our presidential candidates whether they believe every word of the bible or whether they prefer diamonds or pearls perhaps we can start asking them some serious foreign policy questions and quit with the ridiculous and appalling frivolity with which we make inquiries of those who ask to lead the country _meta_end_dot_
