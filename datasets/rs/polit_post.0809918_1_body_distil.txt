  abc news reporter martha raddatz has a piece at their dot com surprising political endorsements by u s _meta_end_dot_

 troops in which she has a few anecdotes from a few carefully selected soldiers about whom they support in the upcoming presidential contest _meta_end_dot_

 by my count she spoke to nine soldiers _meta_end_dot_

 one of them supported hillary four supported obama and four didn t specify but maintained that they would support the candidate who would get them out of iraq the fastest _meta_end_dot_

 of course most would sooner be home with their families than engaging in the nasty business of warfare but there is ugly work to be done _meta_end_dot_

 if it is fair to refer to sgt _meta_end_dot_

 sarbaum whom i m certain has concerns as a merchant of surrender along the lines of clinton or obama i would be very surprised _meta_end_dot_

 otherwsie radditz owes him an apology _meta_end_dot_

 remember folks a small collection of anecdotes chosen to tell the story a reporter wants to be told is not scientific is not journalism and is indicative only of the reporter s dishonesty _meta_end_dot_

 it is not news that some of our soldiers are registered or even partisan democrats who support their party s potential candidates after all they come from amongst americans _meta_end_dot_

 it is disingenuous to misrepresent the words a few of them to attempt to indicate that the entire military supports obama because they believe iraq is an unjust war which we should surrender immediately _meta_end_dot_

 that is the province of barry and hillary and raddatz our soldiers can speak for themselves without the journalistic spin _meta_end_dot_
