  popular treasurer and recent party switcher john kennedy r will run against endangered sen _meta_end_dot_

 landrieu d _meta_end_dot_

 the first poll covering the race is a zogby poll of adults in mid october that puts kennedy ahead _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 there are rumors that karl rove was instrumental in recruiting kennedy to switch parties and run _meta_end_dot_

 no other major rs have shown much interest in running _meta_end_dot_

 thus unless a major change occurs this will be a kennedy v _meta_end_dot_

 landrieu race and easily the best r pickup opportunity in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 not a suspicious zogby online poll _meta_end_dot_
