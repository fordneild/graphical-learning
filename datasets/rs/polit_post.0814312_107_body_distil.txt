  here s the deal when we first declared our site support for congressman paul broun we weren t on slatecard _meta_end_dot_

 we are now _meta_end_dot_

 unfortunately it looks like we have contributed nothing to congressman broun _meta_end_dot_

 we need to improve that situation _meta_end_dot_

 let s review _meta_end_dot_

 congressman broun won a special election to replace charlie norwood _meta_end_dot_

 since congressman broun went into congress he has proven himself to be exactly what conservatives should hope for _meta_end_dot_

 right now the establishment gop is running a candidate against congressman broun in the gop primary _meta_end_dot_

 the district is safely republican but we cannot tolerate a squishy establishment republican replacing congressman broun _meta_end_dot_

 congressman broun needs our help _meta_end_dot_

 he actually does need our money _meta_end_dot_

 like sean parnell in alaska and pete olson in texas and tom rooney in florida and chris hackett in pennsylvania paul broun is the type of republican we need in washington _meta_end_dot_

 i m in for _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 how much are you in for _meta_end_question_
