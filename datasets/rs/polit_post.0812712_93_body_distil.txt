  there is a famous crack by chesterton to the effect that it is possible for things to be too large to see _meta_end_dot_

 the huge and obvious becomes invisible under certain pressures _meta_end_dot_

 take for instance this very useful if dispiriting catalog of capitulation presented ably by mr _meta_end_dot_

 bruce bawer in city journal _meta_end_dot_

 his thesis is simple enough motivated variously and doubtless sometimes simultaneously by fear misguided sympathy and multicultural ideology he writes people at every level of western society but especially elites have allowed concerns about what fundamentalist muslims will feel think or do to influence their actions and expressions dhimmitude _meta_end_dot_

 westerners have begun in other words to internalize the strictures of sharia and thus implicitly to accept the deferential status of dhimmis infidels living in muslim societies bawer goes on to detail at length the many ways in which liberalism is capitulating to an armed doctrine that in most of its specifics is implacably hostile to liberalism _meta_end_dot_

 well and good _meta_end_dot_

 mr _meta_end_dot_

 bawer has proven himself in many respects a careful and daring observer _meta_end_dot_

 he is several steps ahead of most people in his appraisal of the problem _meta_end_dot_

 yet the curiosity the frustration is how blind he is to some elementary observations _meta_end_dot_

 in this he is hardly alone _meta_end_dot_

 there is in fact a whole cottage industry of writing like this where the huge and obvious has become invisible _meta_end_dot_

 in the course of a _meta_number_ref_ word essay mr _meta_end_dot_

 bawer makes use of variations on the word immigration exactly twice by my count and both times it is used descriptively rather than analytically _meta_end_dot_

 it seems that this whole surrender of the west to the rigid code of sharia this forfeiture of our freedom to an alien tyranny is going on right under our noses in perfect innocence of western immigration policy _meta_end_dot_

 islam is a kind of force of nature against which liberalism lacking certain qualities of heroism is impotent _meta_end_dot_

 jihad is not so much an armed doctrine held or freely adopted by living men as a contagion _meta_end_dot_

 what is huge and obvious is that our immigration policy exposes us to the jihad _meta_end_dot_

 what is huge and obvious is that continuing to increase the number of muslims entering our country and other western nations will increase our exposure to this armed doctrine will increase the strength of those whose position is already strong enough to impose upon our leftists and liberals the surrender that bawer describes so vividly _meta_end_dot_
