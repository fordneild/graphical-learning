  note the following in this report concerning the mccain campaign s reaction to yesterday s new york times smear job times story relied on he said they said charges that the charges made were anonymous and that the people making the charges identified themselves as being disgruntled i think that constitutes a serious assessment even if martin and allen do not _meta_end_dot_

 and they should not be surprised if bloggers on the right who are skeptical of mccain still rally to his defense in the wake of the smear _meta_end_dot_

 when stories like the one pushed by the times are so lacking in facts people should denounce them no matter what their general feelings concerning mccain s candidacy _meta_end_dot_

 i don t know why that is so hard to grasp _meta_end_dot_
