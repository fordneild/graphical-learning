  the president has not issued his executive order on earmarks and it appears he won t _meta_end_dot_

 at the same time the house gop shows no willingness to put jeff flake on the appropriations committee _meta_end_dot_

 these two combined show a house gop that has not learned the lesson of _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 how much longer must we wander in the wilderness _meta_end_question_

 at least as long as the president refuses to lead on these issues it seems _meta_end_dot_
