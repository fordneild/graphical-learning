  promoted from diaries by haystack i would be the loudest proponent of withdrawal too gideon_meta_number_ref_ well timed and well said my friend _meta_end_dot_

 in his column in the l a _meta_end_dot_

 times today max boot points out the question that opponents of the war effort have to answer is will iraq s problems become better or worse if we pull our troops out _meta_end_question_

 few who have spent any time in iraq doubt that an american withdrawal would trigger chaos that would make the recent fighting in basra look like a picnic _meta_end_dot_

 that would be not only a terrible stain on our honor we might be indirectly responsible for genocide but a significant strategic setback because it could destabilize the entire region all well and good mr _meta_end_dot_

 boot but you have ignored the fact that proponents of retreat do have an answer for this question which is in my own phrasing far from hurting iraq a retreat would do the most to help iraq _meta_end_dot_

 the iraqis are free riding on american forces _meta_end_dot_

 they won t provide for their own security until we leave _meta_end_dot_

 we have to leave to force them to stand up for themselves it is this position that supporters of the mission in iraq must confront _meta_end_dot_

 it is not enough to assert that retreat would mean chaos _meta_end_dot_

 war opponents argue that the converse is true _meta_end_dot_

 it would be very very nice if the war opponents were right _meta_end_dot_

 if they were i d be the loudest proponent of withdrawal _meta_end_dot_

 but it goes against all the experience we have had thus far in iraq _meta_end_dot_

 more below the fold _meta_end_dot_

 for more than three years american forces did not provide adequate security in iraq _meta_end_dot_

 at night we stayed in heavily fortified bases _meta_end_dot_

 during the day we patrolled in vehicles _meta_end_dot_

 we could not protect iraqis from terrorism extremist militias or even ordinary criminals _meta_end_dot_

 how could law abiding peace seeking iraqis stand up for themselves if they knew that doing so would probably get them killed and their families too _meta_end_question_

 no it was the new strategy and the surge which created the security that allowed iraqis to start standing up for themselves _meta_end_dot_

 they forged new alliances to resist the extremists _meta_end_dot_

 they enlisted by the tens of thousands in the iraqi army _meta_end_dot_

 they even began solving large political problems de baathification budget municipal elections etc _meta_end_dot_

 but we are still early in that process _meta_end_dot_

 it has only been about _meta_number_ref_ months since we began implementing the new strategy and only about _meta_number_ref_ months since we fully implemented it _meta_end_dot_

 it takes a lot more time to form a capable new army to work through all the big political issues to lay the groundwork for a free market economy _meta_end_dot_

 the anti war folks want to measure our accomplishments over the last year against our total time in iraq _meta_number_ref_ years _meta_end_dot_

 but the clock didn t start ticking on the new strategy until it about one year ago _meta_end_dot_

 what is amazing is how far iraq has come in this brief time whether you measure it from january _meta_number_ref_ or from june _meta_end_dot_

 imagine how much further along iraq will be if things continue along the same trajectory for another few years _meta_end_dot_
