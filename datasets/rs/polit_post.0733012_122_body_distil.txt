  update we are now on day two of what is increasingly becoming more difficult to call rioting in france _meta_end_dot_

 youths have reportedly injured _meta_number_ref_ police officers there are troubling reports that firearms are beginning to be used _meta_end_dot_

 so far only conventional which i assume means no automatic weapons and hunting weapons but you don t throw a bottle of burning gasoline at someone unless you re trying to kill him so i suspect that there are a bunch of rioters out there right now busily making arrangements to find something that will penetrate ballistic armor _meta_end_dot_

 see gateway pundit for more details _meta_end_dot_

 it s going to be interesting to see what sarkozy does about this read on _meta_end_dot_

 the length of time it takes to determine the names of the two teenagers whose death sparked these riots is itself enough to spark suspicion and sure enough the names were moushin souhhali and larami the nyt also has the first names _meta_end_dot_

 for those playing at home the names are consistent with north african muslim naming practices _meta_end_dot_

 which you already knew because if they d been more ah gallic the media would have broadcast that on all channels _meta_end_dot_

 meanwhile over twenty cops are injured one was apparently hit in the face with an iron stick various buildings businesses and a police station were burned down and there is at least one report of guns being used by the rioters _meta_end_dot_

 oh yes there was the usual set cars on fire thing which is practically a tradition by now when it comes to french permanent immigrant riots _meta_end_dot_

 all of this mind you from an incident where two kids got themselves killed by running into a police car while not wearing helmets _meta_end_dot_

 so what is sarkozy going to do about it _meta_end_question_

 well isn t that just an interesting question _meta_end_question_

 here s his problem it is not a good idea to allow people to think that the proper response to a perceived community outrage is to throw a molotov cocktail at the nearest police station _meta_end_dot_

 unfortunately this observation comes a little late in the day as it were _meta_end_dot_

 to be fair there is a good deal wrong with france s and most of the rest of europe s method of dealing with its unassimilated immigrant minorities let em rot is not a viable long term strategy but that observation s just a bit late too _meta_end_dot_

 and sarkozy s supposed to be the tough one which doesn t mean that he can t eventually try to sooth things _meta_end_dot_

 but he probably can t do it before he goes out and cracks heads first _meta_end_dot_

 so it s not looking what you d call good unfortunately _meta_end_dot_
