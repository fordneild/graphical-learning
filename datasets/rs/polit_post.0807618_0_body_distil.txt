  sorry spelled his name wrong they d bring out the jeeps in a heartbeat if he said it so baldly _meta_end_dot_

 as it was he went pretty close to the line h t glenn reynolds what a marvelous race this has become _meta_end_dot_

 read on _meta_end_dot_

 for the record while i m under no real obligation to give senator obama the benefit of the doubt his being against the iraq war pretty much means that his judgment can be legitimately questioned on everything up to and including his favorite breakfast cereal his choice of church predates that rather catastrophic lapse in discernment so it s entirely possible that his reasons are as yglesias suggested _meta_end_dot_

 obama could have very easily decided that all in all it only benefited him to attend wright s church _meta_end_dot_

 and he could have even decided to sort of not notice the more racist and bigoted comments _meta_end_dot_

 people do do that you know _meta_end_dot_

 full bore _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ internal consistency is hard particularly when it s in the face of substantial societal pressure _meta_end_dot_

 easier to let things well slide _meta_end_dot_

 alas for senator obama this is precisely the tack that he cannot take _meta_end_dot_

 he s not running as a man he s running as a symbol _meta_end_dot_

 he s hope and change that you can believe in which means that admitting that well it was just less hassle to not give his pastor the what for about the entire aids was created by white people to kill black people stuff would do even more damage to him than his current strategy of looking like a dolt _meta_end_dot_

 from what i can tell his most vehement supporters appear to prefer dolt to say hypocrite the former doesn t actually hack at the reasons why so many of his acolytes seem to support the man _meta_end_dot_

 i suppose that some would find this tragic _meta_end_dot_

 me i m just mildly relieved that he didn t decide to run for governor of illinois _meta_end_dot_

 he might have been a dangerous candidate four or eight years down the line _meta_end_dot_

 moe lane don t care if you disagree with that explicitly stating that you don t have the country with you the only way that you ll prove me wrong is to actually end the war _meta_end_dot_

 there _meta_end_dot_

 that should handle the reflexive commentary _meta_end_dot_
