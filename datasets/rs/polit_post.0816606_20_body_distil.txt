  this roundtable concerns mark halperin s piece concerning what john mccain underestimates _meta_end_dot_

 thomas crown the major league vs little league difference between obama s infrastructure and his own _meta_end_dot_

 this is the only one that worries me _meta_end_dot_

 obama s actually a fairly crappy politician from any standpoint but organization _meta_end_dot_

 mccain is actually a pretty good politician from any standpoint but organization _meta_end_dot_

 moe lane he s an organizational god _meta_end_question_

 then why didn t he win california new jersey rhode island or massachusetts _meta_end_question_

 thomas crown no he s not crappy at organization _meta_end_dot_

 there s a difference _meta_end_dot_

 he s not bush in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 he s clinton in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 more _meta_end_dot_

 moe lane clinton was able to win the rust belt _meta_end_dot_

 obama s spent the last three months pissing off every faction of his party besides overeducated liberal guilt whites and african americans _meta_end_dot_

 if he s going to be the nominee it s because howard dean broke the first hidden rule of dnc chairs do not let the mcgovernite win _meta_end_dot_

 he doesn t think well on his feet there s an excellent chance that members of his staff will be led away next fitzmas day his wife is precisely the sort of person that many white people want to have a frank and full discussion of race about and he s a liberal peacenik _meta_end_dot_

 and they have to manipulate the poll sampling data with a cement trowel to get him six points in a national contest _meta_end_dot_

 organization only takes you so far _meta_end_dot_

 thomas crown you are talking about a different facet of being a politician than that to which i refer _meta_end_dot_

 i agree that in many ways barry is badly badly overrated _meta_end_dot_

 but in organization he is leaps and bounds less bad _meta_end_dot_

 organization is messaging it s gotv it s field offices it s lower level press contacts it s a thousand different things that kitten doesn t personally touch _meta_end_dot_

 moe lane even if that s true about him and so far the only thing that he seems to be decent at is in manipulating caucuses if he doesn t hit majorities in _meta_number_ref_ ev s worth of states his organization doesn t mean bupkis on the presidential level _meta_end_dot_

 thomas crown i completely agree that if this isn t a turnout war all the organization in the world isn t gonna help kitten _meta_end_dot_

 if it is _meta_end_dot_

 blackhedd i ll wade in here with some trepidation because retail politics is something i don t know nearly as well as the rest of you _meta_end_dot_

 there s often a qualitative difference between young organizations that are staffed with seasoned pros and those staffed with inexperienced young people who are fired up true believers _meta_end_dot_

 i ve seen this quite a bit in young entrepreneurial companies _meta_end_dot_

 obama s crew seems to be the latter as was clinton s in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 if you re disciplined methodical and you don t waste any time you can make up the rules as you go along _meta_end_dot_

 you have to be able to learn from your mistakes _meta_end_dot_

 it s just as hard to be willing to learn from your mistakes but that s a problem you have some control over and having a large number of young people willing to walk through fire and water for you makes this possible _meta_end_dot_

 often you ll start out in a new venture with nothing but a gut feel and you ll make a set of operational decisions that because of lack of information are essentially coin flips _meta_end_dot_

 if they pay off everyone says you re a genius and you move to the next level _meta_end_dot_

 if they don t no one ever learns how to spell your name _meta_end_dot_

 from the stories i ve heard axelrod in particular seems to have done something like this with the primary process and they won big _meta_end_dot_

 in particular they seem to have motivated a large army of volunteers who went out into the trenches for them with the fervor of the converted _meta_end_dot_

 my question would be can they keep that up in the general and more importantly is that the key to victory _meta_end_question_

 the fact that they re running a revival movement rather than a political campaign seems like a tremendous advantage _meta_end_dot_

 obama is selling himself as the redeemer who will wash away white america s original sin _meta_end_dot_

 mccain really has nothing to sell but america has voted against obama s ideas again and again to which the obvious easy rejoinder is well what we re doin now ain t workin is it i have an acquaintance who is a serial entrepreneur _meta_end_dot_

 she s an incredibly motivational manager _meta_end_dot_

 she has this uncanny way of inspiring true belief and her people would walk through fire for her _meta_end_dot_

 i ve often thought that she would have been perfect to lead the october revolution _meta_end_dot_

 great character and true belief enables you to sign up quite a few rounds of venture capital and even a handful of real customers and partners who buy the vision _meta_end_dot_

 the problem of course is that there s no ability to lead talented professionals who aren t necessarily drinking the kool aid but who do have the ability to execute the million things you have to get right every day _meta_end_dot_

 so she s never really hit a home run with any of her companies _meta_end_dot_

 and additionally her raw star power she s been on the cover of forbes hides some serious insecurity and some truly evil character flaws that eventually end up pissing off everyone she touches _meta_end_dot_

 i think of this woman when i see obama and my question is can he become president on star power and atmospherics abetted by a huge crowd of star struck grassroots volunteers _meta_end_question_

 or is the inevitable moment of reckoning on this side of november _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_question_

 moe lane an electoral campaign is designed to do one thing hit a home run _meta_end_dot_

 this doesn t always mean winning dennis kuchinich is actually one of the best professional politicians out there because he always accomplishes his personal goals when he runs for president _meta_end_dot_

 so the idea of obama as a startup actually reassures me most of those ventures fail on their own _meta_end_dot_

 the ones that succeed usually hadn t faced a rival organization willing to personally target their leaders reputations and ability to raise money then broadcast it all on national television _meta_end_dot_

 dan mclaughlin first of all a reminder that obama needs _meta_number_ref_ electoral votes while mccain needs _meta_number_ref_ because if this goes to the house the democrats control a majority of the delegations _meta_end_dot_

 second there are five main things that matter in a political campaign _meta_end_dot_

 to add one more thing and this is a key one halperin ends his list with this i have yet to see evidence that obama will do this _meta_end_dot_

 to the contrary he seems quite firm about not moving to the center on the war on taxes on health care on the courts on social issues it s true that he need only nod slightly to the center and the media will declare him the greatest bipartisan stateman since george washington but i don t know that anybody will trust his media coverage by october _meta_end_dot_

 while it s true that people mostly don t vote specific issues the overall picture of his unyielding left wing radicalism is going to come out _meta_end_dot_

 ben domenech i agree completely on that point dan _meta_end_dot_

 what s more it s the lack of such movement that i think will make the flight of the obamaconchords so short lived _meta_end_dot_

 doug kmiec is not a trendsetter in other words _meta_end_dot_

 we re still waiting on that rejection of the naral endorsement _meta_end_dot_

 adam c some data to back you up _meta_end_dot_
