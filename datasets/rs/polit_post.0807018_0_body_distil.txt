  tom ricks and karen deyoung of the washington post have obtained an early draft of doug feith s forthcoming war and decision _meta_end_dot_

 in an amazing act of speed reading they got through the entire _meta_number_ref_ page manuscript in one day so they could do a preview in yesterday s paper _meta_end_dot_

 perhaps not surprisingly they didn t like the book _meta_end_dot_

 read on _meta_end_dot_

 didn t like may be too kind a term _meta_end_dot_

 ricks and deyoung go after feith with a hachet _meta_end_dot_

 but i think their very eagerness to get out in front of the book and discredit it as a massive attempt at score settling is telling it made me wonder if what we have here is a cat among the pigeons _meta_end_dot_

 from ricks and deyoung s account it seems war and decision questions many cherished assumptions about the iraq war and the role of defense department civilians in post war planning _meta_end_dot_

 thems who conventional wisdom has established as good guys come off as not so good _meta_end_dot_

 convenient scapegoats including feith himself now have their own side of the story and rather inconveniently for ricks and deyoung the documentation to back it up _meta_end_dot_

 it will be interesting to see how books such as war and decision re shape public understanding of iraq that has been so far largely controlled by the media _meta_end_dot_

 as someone who is rather skeptical of traditional reporting on the war it seems to me that anything that causes the washington post this much discomfiture must be worth reading _meta_end_dot_

 after all feith had a rather more immediate viewpoint of the planning and execution of the iraq war than even tom ricks _meta_end_dot_

 so if you re interested in judging feith s account in full rather than by the excerpts selected for you by ricks and deyoung war and decision will be out in a few weeks _meta_end_dot_

 stay tuned _meta_end_dot_
