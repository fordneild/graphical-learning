 moe that s the answer to the huffpo s question will the gop blindside the democrats on terror issues _meta_end_question_

 glenn reynolds comments that a full frontal blindsiding can take place when you ve got a blind spot _meta_end_dot_

 anyway you can pretty much ignore the rest of the article ed morrissey summed it up perfectly well when he noted that its message was that m ore than six years after _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ the democrats still have no comprehensive national security or counterterrorism plan no dubya bad _meta_end_exclamation_

 don keys good _meta_end_exclamation_

 dubya bad _meta_end_exclamation_

 don keys good is not really a national security plan _meta_end_dot_

 really and truly _meta_end_dot_

 look i don t care what your favorite blogger told you _meta_end_dot_

 read on _meta_end_dot_

 of course the democrats may decide that the best option on creating a national security policy is the simplest give up and borrow ours _meta_end_dot_

 this courtesy of tom maguire tom goes on to categorize the lipstick on this particular pig as a pious desire to not tie the next president s hands stop laughing that s from the obligatory nyt editorial _meta_end_dot_

 the official idea is to pass a law that requires the president to get congressional approval before making a long term deal with iraq the actual idea is to give the progressives a suitably contentious topic to beat their chests and howl about while the democratic party goes about the pleasant business of shearing the base _meta_end_dot_

 don t believe me _meta_end_question_

 think _meta_end_dot_

 this won t pass this year george bush will veto any bill that has this provision in it and he ll sustain the veto _meta_end_dot_

 remember s chip _meta_end_question_

 remember how he won s chip in the end _meta_end_question_

 note inserted by jeff this seems like an appropriate place to remind the electorate that bush won on s chip by a grand total of _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ in case anybody had forgotten he ll win this one too assuming it even passes a cloture vote in the first place _meta_end_dot_

 this really should be sort of obvious by the way _meta_end_dot_

 and after next january hey george w bush won t be president _meta_end_dot_

 somebody else will be _meta_end_dot_

 let s look at the possibilities shall we _meta_end_question_

 dem president dem congress _meta_end_dot_

 this legislation becomes redundant no need for it _meta_end_dot_

 dem president gop congress _meta_end_dot_

 this legislation becomes suicidal for the democrats surely they have no intention of giving us such a gift _meta_end_question_

 gop president gop congress _meta_end_dot_

 after you re done chuckling concede that it s redundant too _meta_end_dot_

 gop president dem congress _meta_end_dot_

 no change relevant _meta_end_dot_

 hey _meta_end_dot_

 looking at all of that i can only conclude one of two things either the democrats are grandstanding or they re actively afraid that we re going to win the presidential election after all _meta_end_dot_

 or to put it into starker terms for the progressives when it comes to your most cherished policy stances your party leaders are either being hypocrites or cowards _meta_end_dot_

 again _meta_end_dot_

 personally i think it s just pragmatism _meta_end_dot_

 well maybe pragmatism with a little bit of cowardice _meta_end_dot_

 after all how to incorporate this into the narrative _meta_end_question_

 the answer is of course that the democratic party cannot _meta_end_dot_

 the ramifications of failure were contemplated the ramifications of success were not _meta_end_dot_

 which is why the retreat is happening now _meta_end_dot_

 the democrats know that they will take a hit on this but perhaps they can minimize the effects _meta_end_dot_

 a faint hope but the best that can be hoped for under the circumstances _meta_end_dot_

 and so we go back to the beginning _meta_end_dot_

 there is no blindsiding going on _meta_end_dot_

 there is merely the inevitable consequence to the willful and frankly stupid decision by the democratic party to treat national security issues as just one more thing to play politics with _meta_end_dot_

 some of you will now squirm screech pout point fingers name call accuse whine pound on the table bluster and do just about anything else beside accept this go ahead and have fun with that _meta_end_dot_

 when you re done the democrats will still have to somehow deal with the fact that calling the gwot bush s war when it looked like the usa was losing it makes it very very difficult to call it anything else now that it looks like the usa s actually winning it _meta_end_dot_

 and trust us on this we over here on the right have no intention of making it easy for you _meta_end_dot_

 or to use the antiwar movement s own term of art not in your name _meta_end_dot_

 moe this is certainly true of the democratic party when it comes to natsec but i m leery of pushing the metaphor too far _meta_end_dot_
