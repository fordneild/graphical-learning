  promoted from diaries and a note to the unworthy successors to the sons of heaven _meta_end_question_

 please be advised that even when we of the united states of america require a foreign opinion on any holder of the office of speaker of the house a title that predates your own regime by several generations it will be some time before we work our way down to nation states that have yet to see their first century let alone their first successful one _meta_end_dot_

 and even then we will probably first inquire of the republic of china _meta_end_dot_

 moe lane hat tip to academic elephant for alerting us all to this in redhot while the chinese violently choke tibet consistent with the chinese policy of the last _meta_number_ref_ years speaker pelosi visited the headquarters of the tibetan government in exile and condemned their country s cruel subjection _meta_end_dot_

 the trip had been planned weeks in advance but speaker pelosi did not merely follow the plans she had made previously _meta_end_dot_

 perhaps it is our karma perhaps it is our fate we be with you at this time she remarked _meta_end_dot_

 indeed perhaps it was _meta_end_dot_

 then speaker pelosi declared if freedom loving people throughout the world do not speak out against china s oppression in china and tibet we have lost all moral authority to speak on behalf of human rights anywhere in the world an exaggeration to be sure but an excusable one in the warmth of the moment _meta_url_ref_ the chinese communists have responded awkwardly the soviets were much more talented at propaganda human rights police like pelosi are habitually bad tempered and ungenerous when it comes to china refusing to check their facts and find out the truth of the case _meta_end_dot_

 her views are like so many other politicians and western media _meta_end_dot_

 beneath the double standards lies their intention to serve the interest groups behind them who want to contain or smear china _meta_url_ref_ count me among those who would like to contain china _meta_end_dot_

 so here is my telegram to the chinese government which will be sent as soon as western union finds the right address dear commies blow it out your ear stop pelosi may be a bad speaker but she s our speaker stop she is also completely right stop you on the other hand are thugs stop and you smell stop so do your mamas stop good luck with the olympics stop gov _meta_end_dot_

 romney will not be available to reverse your horrendous financial losses three cheers for speaker pelosi _meta_end_dot_

 down with communist china _meta_end_dot_
