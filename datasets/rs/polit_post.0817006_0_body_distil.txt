  it s nice to see that john mccain is in favor of removing the ban on offshore drilling note the popularity of the proposal _meta_end_dot_

 i know that this kind of policy proposal is going to run into a partisan buzzsaw but it is impossible to take seriously the obama campaign s argument that a removal of the ban on offshore drilling only serves to benefit oil companies _meta_end_dot_

 it appears that we have to delve into economics _meta_number_ref_ prices are high because demand outruns supply _meta_end_dot_

 to remedy that we need to drill for more oil so that we can bring supply and demand into balance _meta_end_dot_

 i suppose of course that if someone has connections with the magic oil fairy we could avoid all of this but i kind of doubt that this is the case and it should be noted that the obama campaign has come up with no proposals whatsoever aimed at increasing the supply of oil in order to alleviate current price pressures _meta_end_dot_
