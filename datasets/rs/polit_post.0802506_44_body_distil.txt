  can we please start wondering about the standards of journalism that caused paul krugman to be hired at the paper of record _meta_end_question_

 don t know what i am writing about _meta_end_question_

 then read this _meta_end_dot_

 and then after you are done read this _meta_end_dot_

 and oh have we mentioned the peace dividend that came about thanks to the reagan administration working to help bring the cold war to a victorious end _meta_end_question_

 yes i know that reagan did not win the cold war singlehandedly _meta_end_dot_

 but he did help win it the doubts of his many critics notwithstanding _meta_end_dot_
