  hillary social engineer extraordinaire has decided to delve into the world of automobile engineering and rework america from the inside out _meta_end_dot_

 leave it to hillary to wear her knowledge of internal combustion multi point fuel injection and variable spark duration like a velvet glove only to reach deep into heart of the american family and squeeze the life out of it _meta_end_dot_

 from her website what worries me most about this is that hillary and her liberal pals seem to think liberal ideas act independently of the laws of physics _meta_end_dot_

 despite the fact that fuel efficiency has doubled since _meta_number_ref_ when the clamp down truly initiated we are not necessarily capable of repeating this feat every _meta_number_ref_ years _meta_end_dot_

 much of fuel efficiency has more to do with car weight gear ratios and other factors that are not endless sources of innovation _meta_end_dot_

 there are advances to be made in such things as spark duration and quality turbo systems tire construction etc _meta_end_dot_

 but realistically any major advance in those categories might yield a _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ mpg gain at the cost of huge amounts of research _meta_end_dot_

 what we are left with is an order to tall to fill _meta_end_dot_

 as automobiles have increased in fuel efficiency they have increased in price as well and it s no coincidence _meta_end_dot_

 fuel efficiency is born out of engineering which costs lots of money _meta_end_dot_

 who will pay for it _meta_end_question_

 the consumer _meta_end_dot_

 in _meta_number_ref_ when ralph nader got his hands on the _meta_number_ref_ hemi the average mpg was _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ miles _meta_end_dot_

 today the standard is _meta_number_ref_ mpg _meta_end_dot_

 the average cost of an automobile in _meta_number_ref_ adjusted for inflation was _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 today it s over _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_exclamation_

 if hillary was to get hr way by _meta_number_ref_ accounting for inflation we could have car prices averaging well over _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ to pay for the increase in technology and research _meta_end_dot_

 but i am thinking that hillary and the dems are imagining another way to achieve these goals with less reliance on automobile engineering and more on some serious social engineering _meta_end_dot_

 put it together folks _meta_end_dot_

 hillary is making near impossible goals for cafe standards _meta_end_dot_

 at the same time we have dems on the hill pushing for a more stringent standard of classification of suv s and automobiles that would make suv s and work trucks in the same class as a honda civic _meta_end_dot_

 this not only would be a major crushing blow to the american worker who needs a pickup at an affordable cost to do his work but also to the american mother who needs a car she can fit her kids and groceries in _meta_end_dot_

 by making the fuel economy standard impossible for mini van and suv s she is insuring their extinction _meta_end_dot_

 schwinn _meta_end_dot_

 auto engineering meet social engineering _meta_end_dot_

 henry ford meet aldous huxley _meta_end_dot_

 had to pull this information from a bunch of sources for the graph _meta_end_dot_

 i wouldn t use this graph as exact numbers for certain years but rather an indisputable evidence of the relationship between mpg and cost
