  i continue to be absolutely amazed at the amount of unadulterated mendacity being peddled by serious experts on finance and economics in news interviews _meta_end_dot_

 the global financial system continues to be rocked by a now eight month long credit crisis _meta_end_dot_

 the effects of the crisis on the real economy are now beginning to be felt _meta_end_dot_

 the impact of the news reporting on consumer confidence has long been in evidence and millions of people now owe more on their home mortgages than their houses are actually worth _meta_end_dot_

 the situation is a lot like the aftermath of hurricane katrina _meta_end_dot_

 clamor for federal action has reached fever pitch _meta_end_dot_

 meanwhile the administration insists that it s already doing all the right things while at the same time uncomfortably pledging to do more _meta_end_dot_

 and the political opposition is making hay _meta_end_dot_

 keep reading _meta_end_dot_

 it s true that the current global financial crisis was triggered by distress in the subprime sector of the us mortgage market _meta_end_dot_

 but it s also true that the conditions that set up the crisis are extremely complex and poorly understood _meta_end_dot_

 fortunately this very complexity will militate against hasty and ill considered policy responses to the problem _meta_end_dot_

 things are different with respect to the mortgage situation at the level of individual homeowners _meta_end_dot_

 it doesn t take much for an individual whose property has fallen in value to feel like she got screwed by someone _meta_end_dot_

 and if that unidentifiable someone won t make her whole then the government should _meta_end_dot_

 this adds up to some nearly insurmountable political pressure for a national mortgage bailout not least because it can be oversimplified into a compelling sound bite through no fault of their own millions of homeowners are being pushed to the brink of foreclosure and if we don t help them their distress will destroy the economy we ve rehearsed the arguments against a bailout here many times _meta_end_dot_

 the first one is moral hazard _meta_end_dot_

 many people took advantage of an extreme lapse in underwriting standards during _meta_number_ref_ and early _meta_number_ref_ to buy more house than they could afford _meta_end_dot_

 at the same time rocket science risk management technology fooled many lending institutions into thinking that they could offer credit to people that were quite likely to default simply by charging a high enough rate of interest _meta_end_dot_

 there are a lot of dirty hands here and bailing them out will ensure that they ll try to do the same thing again the next chance they get _meta_end_dot_

 the second counterargument is economic _meta_end_dot_

 the collapse in home values simply means that a large amount of asset value has disappeared _meta_end_dot_

 it s disappeared both from the real estate component of the capital stock of the us and it s also disappeared from the value of financial assets held by lenders if we go to the banks and the homeowners that lost money and write them a check to cover their losses the result can only be one of the following either we ll take money away from people who did nothing to lose it or we ll create an enormous pulse of inflation _meta_end_dot_

 the best approach is to let the situation work itself out on its own _meta_end_dot_

 the bush administration already has in place a policy for encouraging and facilitating private workout arrangements in which distressed homeowners and lenders get together case by case to negotiate lower rates short sales or other contract modifications _meta_end_dot_

 i m told that more than a million such facilitated workouts have already been done _meta_end_dot_

 the great virtue of individual workouts is that they avoid the need to decide on a general approach to the problem that can be encoded in legislation _meta_end_dot_

 every situation is different _meta_end_dot_

 there really are people out there who bought too much house or were actively trying to speculate on rising home values _meta_end_dot_

 these people should get a bad outcome not a bailout _meta_end_dot_

 there are other people who really do not qualify to be homeowners _meta_end_dot_

 they should be foreclosed quickly and without too much pain so they can get back into rentals and start rebuilding their finances _meta_end_dot_

 in many cases these people have relatively little equity to lose anyway so their downside is quite limited _meta_end_dot_

 and then there are people with a lot of home equity built up over years who cashed it out at unaffordable rates _meta_end_dot_

 these are tricky cases _meta_end_dot_

 on the one hand bailing them out means that you and i will be paying for a lot of florida vacations and home improvements that happened two and three years ago _meta_end_dot_

 i m not up for that _meta_end_dot_

 in other cases there were medical expenses or the costs of starting up new businesses _meta_end_dot_

 that s touchier _meta_end_dot_

 so every one of the millions of cases is different _meta_end_dot_

 and the lenders have every incentive to compromise because foreclosure is a total killer for them _meta_end_dot_

 as i said it s best to let this happen organically over time _meta_end_dot_

 and the housing market will find its level at some point and start trading again _meta_end_dot_

 but if we go out and do a bailout then we ll end up with a one size fits all national formula _meta_end_dot_

 and it will be arrived at by political means _meta_end_dot_

 you ll be told that it s cruel heartless and racist to throw millions of women and minorities all with starving and telegenic children out onto the street _meta_end_dot_

 and you ll also be told that your own livelihood is at risk as all of those millions of new homeless stop buying the goods and services that your employer provides _meta_end_dot_

 reality has nothing to do with a decision making process like this _meta_end_dot_

 to be sure democratic politicians and commentators are encouraging exactly this kind of an outcome _meta_end_dot_

 their attitude is that time s a wasting while we conservatives hesitate over the wisdom and the morality of modifying millions of private contracts _meta_end_dot_

 they think it s absolutely the right thing to do to forcibly change private arrangements that were freely entered into and broke no laws _meta_end_dot_

 in older and quainter times such behavior was known as tyranny and we once fought a revolution to free ourselves from it _meta_end_dot_

 the administration is now facing an extremely delicate political balance _meta_end_dot_

 the last thing they want to face is the all too credible charge that they are acting like the hoover administration drifting and dissembling while the economy crashes and burns _meta_end_dot_

 for their part the democrats have a golden opportunity to press this line and ride it to greater political power and a much expanded federal role in the management of the economy _meta_end_dot_

 the administration will try to steer a middle course _meta_end_dot_

 they will promise to keep working on the problem of mortgage relief and to search for a bipartisan solution with congressional democrats _meta_end_dot_

 the democrats will have the political wisdom to let the republicans continue to own the whole problem while proposing draconian and highly popular relief legislation _meta_end_dot_

 senator mccain for his part should stand up and exercise leadership by saying that individual taxpayers should not have to pay for the errors of others _meta_end_dot_

 politically it s all going to come down to the following question ladies and gentlemen do you believe that individuals facing foreclosure are for the most part in a situation of their own making _meta_end_question_

 or were they preyed upon by rapacious bankers and wall streeters _meta_end_question_

 how you frame the question determines the approach you ll take to the solution _meta_end_dot_

 and that applies to the electorate as a whole _meta_end_dot_

 so much for the politics of the situation _meta_end_dot_

 the economics are quite complex and deserve a long post on their own _meta_end_dot_
