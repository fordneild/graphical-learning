  michelle malkin who is as unhappy as anybody about the prospect of john mccain as our nominee reminds disappointed conservatives that there are a lot of other useful outlets for their frustrations the presidential race will be with us for the next _meta_number_ref_ months _meta_end_dot_

 if you are one of the activists who really can t stomach mccain you can always just take a step back for a while and forget about the white house you have plenty of time to think about whether you are willing to pull the lever for him in november or not _meta_end_dot_

 in the meantime roll up your sleeves and get to work building a firewall in congress and electing good governors and state legislators back home _meta_end_dot_

 trust me there s enough races to go around for everyone to find somewhere to send their money and time _meta_end_dot_
