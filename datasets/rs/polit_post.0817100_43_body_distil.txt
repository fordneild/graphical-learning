  john mccain s position on energy exploration is getting help at the highest levels the popularity of the argument they tread on dangerous political ground _meta_end_dot_

 it s clear that expanding drilling won t lower prices overnight _meta_end_dot_

 but that argument has been used again and again every time someone has had the courage to point out that drilling needs to be expanded and thus we are where we are _meta_end_dot_

 if we had taken action in the past perhaps we would have been able to bring some downward pressure on prices during the present day _meta_end_dot_

 there has been quite enough delay on this issue _meta_end_dot_

 ridiculously for a period of many years we have psyched ourselves out of expanding energy exploration because it would take time to achieve and we are only now beginning to realize that if we had gone ahead with increased energy exploration we may now be enjoying the benefits _meta_end_dot_

 there is nothing we can do now about past mistakes but there is something we can do about ensuring that future mistakes are not made _meta_end_dot_

 the fact that good policy coincides with good politics is only an added bonus as far as mccain supporters are concerned _meta_end_dot_
