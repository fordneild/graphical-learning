  our own ben domenech has an editorial up at the washington times that is especially well timed _meta_end_dot_

 entitled conservative seeds of destruction ben reminds us of a fundamental truth about the so called conservative movement responding to mcclellan s book ben suggests this unleavened bread indeed _meta_end_dot_

 the book itself has faded from the headlines a week running the number of google hits dropping steadily and mcclellan will soon achieve the state of nothingness that always follows such adventures _meta_end_dot_

 he leaves behind some food for thought however in the larger context _meta_end_dot_

 more below the fold _meta_end_dot_

 misplaced trust has become a thing all too familiar to conservatives as ben suggests in citing the litany of examples during the bush years _meta_end_dot_

 he mentions fema and miers but there are more _meta_end_dot_

 there s immigration and prescription drugs and no child left behind as well and each of these serve to remind us that conservatism is only as effective as the leaders we entrust with pushing the conservative agenda forward _meta_end_dot_

 this election cycle is yet again a double edged sword on the one hand we have a presidential nominee that many suggest is not conservative enough and some of these arguments are fair and valid _meta_end_dot_

 but we also have house and senate races to consider _meta_end_dot_

 much of the damage that s been done to the conservative movement lies at the feet of our leadership in congress and it is in large part because of our own misplaced trust every republican politician wants to be a conservative but not every one of them acts that way on a consistent basis nor are they pursued diligently enough by their constituents to hold them to those campaign commitments _meta_end_dot_

 going forward we must stop taking them at their word _meta_end_dot_

 as ben suggests in the wind down adding that conservatism will only survive as a coherent movement if it embraces the reality that conservatism is larger than the politicians who invoke its principles to be an activism oriented movement again we re going to have to trust but verify this can be done but it needs to be done soon _meta_end_dot_

 ben gets the last word
