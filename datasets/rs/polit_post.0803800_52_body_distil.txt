  this is the first of what we hope will be a semi regular occurrence email roundtables among the rs contributors _meta_end_dot_

 with a special appearance by the elusive thomas crown _meta_end_dot_

 dan mclaughlin so the great mardi gras primary day has come and gone and while john mccain has not wrapped up the nomination he seems now to be in a commanding position with few realistic obstacles left to overcome _meta_end_dot_

 i think most of us contributors other than adam would agree that sen _meta_end_dot_

 mccain is not our first choice and that all things being equal we would prefer a candidate who takes more conservative policy positions and uses more conservative rhetoric than mccain on a number of issues _meta_end_dot_

 so i open the floor to a couple of related questions did the primary process fail conservatives _meta_end_question_

 did the gop electorate prefer to pick a less conservative candidate this time around and if not why do we appear likely to get one _meta_end_question_

 and how do we conservatives going about the business of ensuring that next time _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ we get a more conservative nominee _meta_end_question_

 read on _meta_end_dot_

 i ll kick off with five observations of my own _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 i don t think it was inevitable that the primary voters in this cycle would choose a non conservative nominee _meta_end_dot_

 i do think the primary electorate wanted someone visibly different from george w _meta_end_dot_

 bush and that was likely to mean less conservative on at least some issues but there was room to run to bush s right on others like immigration and spending _meta_end_dot_

 mccain s rise has had more to do with the peculiarities of the people in this field than any shift in mood away from a robust conservatism _meta_end_dot_

 as i have said ad nauseum ideas don t run for president people do _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 the people who did run were less a feature of the times than an accident of history mccain romney rudy and huck ran because of the points they were at in their careers although in rudy s case that was clearly influenced by the timing of _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 only fred was really pulled into the race by popular demand for his ideas and fred ran the most conservative campaign _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 that said the people did not run fell into three groups those who were too personally tied to bush to run e g jeb those who were clearly not ready for the national stage e g bobby jindal and those whose careers were derailed by _meta_number_ref_ e g george allen _meta_end_dot_

 only the third group is really a feature of the ideological climate as opposed to personal circumstance _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 you can t really blame the process for dictating the nature of the race as mccain s really crucial victories came in two fairly conservative southern states south carolina and florida that were hardly his natural turf _meta_end_dot_

 that said i see three impacts from the calendar _meta_end_dot_

 first romney s hometown ties to new hampshire and michigan robbed rudy of a natural starting point in the early states and probably discouraged him from running harder there _meta_end_dot_

 i wouldn t suggest that that was the biggest factor in rudy s demise but it exacerbated his problems _meta_end_dot_

 second the short space between florida and super tuesday made it impossible for the anti mccain forces to rally effectively behind a single candidate although i m still skeptical that that was possible i don t buy that huck s voters would have preferred romney to mccain by the substantial margins needed to unseat the leader _meta_end_dot_

 and third the northeastern states by going to winner take all and ganging up on super tuesday while most other states divided their delegates ended up having an outsize role in tuesday s delegate count _meta_end_dot_

 it s probably wiser in the future for states to go to winner take all if they want their voters preferences to have equal weight in the process _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 can we please get rid of caucuses _meta_end_question_

 romney kept winning small state caucuses but it never helped him _meta_end_dot_

 huckabee won west virginia when the mccain forces fell in behind him leading to much gnashing of teeth about backroom deals from the romney camp _meta_end_dot_

 if every state had a primary we would not have endless arguments about weighing the legitimacy of different states choices _meta_end_dot_

 leon wolf i think and i have made this observation before that mccain got where he was in the same way that college football teams rise to the top of the season ending polls by being the candidate with the most distant loss timewise _meta_end_dot_

 mccain has done much to grieve conservatives over the years but he s done a pretty good job of keeping his nose clean recently which is what seems to have counted _meta_end_dot_

 throughout this race we ve had occasion to consider in turn giualini romney and huckabee as frontrunners _meta_end_dot_

 as each gained a place of prominence in the polls all of their weaknesses were dissected and screamed about by various factions of the party until it came to the point that everyone came back to hey what about mccain and unlike rudy huck and romney by the time people got their dander up about mccain it was too late _meta_end_dot_

 as to the primary system i m fine with it as it is with a few minor tweaks _meta_end_dot_

 we could do a lot worse than having our earliest primaries be in five swing states ia nh nv mi fl and a state from the base of our party s support sc _meta_end_dot_

 like dan however i would end caucuses which i don t really even understand _meta_end_dot_

 moe lane i think we should be asking instead whether conservatives failed the primary process more accurately whether they are trying to destroy the point of it entirely in order to reinsitute a system by which the nominee is chosen at the republican convention _meta_end_dot_

 i do not think that this is a conscious goal but judging from the way that we have watched every serious candidate except fred thompson get pummeled for their lack of conservative bona fides i would not be surprised if we start seeing general anti primary feelings _meta_end_dot_

 i ll also note while i m happy to discuss the possibilities of junking the primary system entirely we do have a current system of rules in place to determine the nominee i am not impressed with the apparent willingness of some to only accept the results of the system when it s their candidate winning it and if i remember my political history correctly the gop was considerably more liberal before we started relying on primaries _meta_end_dot_

 i m not sure if there s a link there but i have my suspicions _meta_end_dot_

 dan mclaughlin moe i think that first of all the serial attacks on the conservative credentials of mccain then mitt then rudy then huck happened for a reason all four had real vulnerabilities on that score _meta_end_dot_

 i m more sympathetic to the claim that sam brownback got pecked to death over comparatively minor deviations from the party line on immigration and iraq but brownback wasn t going to be the nominee anyway _meta_end_dot_

 i ll leave for another day the issue of how people should approach the general election but i really think that other than immigration where you had a genuine revolt of the base against bush the conservative disquiet over this field was mainly about who the people in this field were and are rather than a hunger for absolute purity or a desire to return to boss ism _meta_end_dot_

 moe lane from my quasi outside viewpoint it looked more like a dramatic re enactment of shirley jackson s the lottery neil stevens i like caucuses _meta_end_dot_

 i d like us actually to go even further and use more conventions _meta_end_dot_

 if we had _meta_number_ref_ state conventions i d be happy _meta_end_dot_

 why _meta_end_question_

 this would ensure that conservatives and any other faction that wants something have to get involved in the state parties from the bottom up in order to get anywhere _meta_end_dot_

 primaries inspire lazy dreams of ronald reagan coming and sweeping the party off its feet _meta_end_dot_

 conventions and to a lesser degree caucuses snap us out of that and get us back to work _meta_end_dot_

 romney won some caucuses for the same reason he won utah largely _meta_end_dot_

 look at the geography _meta_end_dot_

 he won caucuses in nevada and wyoming _meta_end_dot_

 he didn t win them in iowa or louisiana _meta_end_dot_

 i will also speculate that there s a bit of a bradley effect for romney in caucuses versus primaries _meta_end_dot_

 that s a fluke of the candidate not of the process _meta_end_dot_

 thomas crown oh hell _meta_end_dot_

 ok _meta_end_dot_

 it s my lunch break anyway _meta_end_dot_

 insofar as there are conservatives or indeed anyone who traditionally associates with the republican brand threatening to sit out the general election their existence is not relevant to the primaries as a whole _meta_end_dot_

 heck the freaking ron paul anti semite goldbug voters are still showing up and god alone knows if they ll even be sober when the general is happening _meta_end_dot_

 what republican voters are doing is simply having a nationwide primary _meta_end_dot_

 exclude the odd ball states of iowa and new hampshire take my wife please and i d submit what we have is a national referendum vote in slow motion on the several candidates _meta_end_dot_

 would john mccain seriously have won even a significant number of conservatives in south carolina and florida the latter of which is not remotely as purple as everyone outside the state believes but for the huckasurge romney s collapse and giuliani s disappearance from the race elsewhere _meta_end_question_

 would pro choice republican voters have so assiduously flocked to a man whose only real shots at the pro life movement were in the traitorous let s call it what it was bcra and voting for federal funding to slice and dice children for stem cell research _meta_end_question_

 what you have is a voting group with long memories conservative moderate liberal rejects from the silly party who have watched how the race has developed and how the candidates have picked each other apart over time _meta_end_dot_

 as a result the primaries not the conventions are more like an aggregate caucus where the voters of each state see how each candidate does in the prior states before voting _meta_end_dot_

 no one s failed anyone _meta_end_dot_

 i think this system is way too accelerated for our or anyone else s good but the end result appears to be that the party as a whole is picking a fellow who has been a fairly consistent conservative and who has generated an enormous amount of good press that s a bad thing for ten years _meta_end_dot_

 i think we re going to have a collective headache in a year but the point of a primary process is to produce a candidate who either inspires or doesn t offend his party and who can compete in the general election _meta_end_dot_

 seems to be working to me _meta_end_dot_

 i also dispute dan s description of mccain as a non conservative _meta_end_dot_

 st _meta_end_dot_

 john the mccain is an egomaniac of the first order has some significant deviations from conservative orthodoxy is only rhetorically opposed to pork and government growth and gives the entirely justified impression that he d sell us all down the river for good press but on the whole he s a pretty conservative guy _meta_end_dot_

 honestly as second tier candidates go which both parties are running this year mccain ain t bad _meta_end_dot_

 adam c the thomas seal of approval mccain ain t bad i think the election is now sealed _meta_end_dot_

 mark kilmer and i think those who have lately been flipping their lids at mccain s prospects are unfocused with a few justified criticisisms but mainly a pile of emotional hollering and hissing dissonance which should not appeal to the more deliberate amongst us _meta_end_dot_

 we know mccain we know what he s done and we know what we do not like about him and his record _meta_end_dot_

 we do not need these people and their often hyperbolic fictionalizing _meta_end_dot_

 plus there was no conservative alternative to mccain _meta_end_dot_

 romney to be that again but as michael steele told bill hemmer this am conservatives get the joke we can see through romney _meta_end_dot_

 the primary system should be what the states and the parties wish it to be and perhaps we could have a symposium on that when this is all over _meta_end_dot_

 i do not want the federal government involved in any way _meta_end_dot_

 thomas crown for a second tier candidate _meta_end_dot_

 context my dear adam _meta_end_dot_

 thomas crown incidentally i have no problem with caucuses it s not like the rudy guys were all going to get together and beat up the huckabee guys but i have a serious problem with state conventions _meta_end_dot_

 our nation is a republic _meta_end_dot_

 i see no reason why our party has to be the name notwithstanding _meta_end_dot_

 thomas crown really the remarkable thing about this year is that the only more or less classic conservative in the race badly mismanaged his campaign and as a result or maybe because of other things i m no vis numar never caught on _meta_end_dot_

 as dan notes we have an awful gap in our farm team _meta_end_dot_

 it should close by _meta_number_ref_ or so but it s a pain in the tush this year _meta_end_dot_

 academic elephant one thing i think we should consider is if _meta_number_ref_ is a good year on which to base sweeping conclusions about the fate of the republican party and the future of our primary process _meta_end_dot_

 every election cycle is of course unique but this one is a little more unique than others _meta_end_dot_

 the lack of an ordained successor in the incumbent party has thrown everyone off spawned an interminable expensive lead up to the primaries and generally sown confusion _meta_end_dot_

 is it any wonder that we re winding up with a candidate who is so controversial that he has created his very own breed of derangement syndrome in his own party before he s even secured the nomination _meta_end_question_

 i suspect that this is a result of bizarre circumstance _meta_end_dot_

 as we re considering our fate and our future it might be worth pondering if we think this is likely to happen again and if not if it s worth recalibrating based on this freak of a cycle _meta_end_dot_

 adam c for the record _meta_number_ref_ i think states should trash caucuses _meta_end_dot_

 i appreciate that they do not receive much media attention hopefully that will encourage states to change _meta_end_dot_

 they may empower conservatives or activists but they hurt in making more people identify as republican and they allow a small group of people to trump a candidate with wider appeal to all republicans _meta_end_dot_

 honestly a caucus mid day on a work day wv is a ludicrous way to let people be involved in the process and feel invested _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ i think the current system is not that bad _meta_end_dot_

 it s mostly swing states _meta_end_dot_

 it allows retail politics _meta_end_dot_

 the delegates are small but the momentum matters _meta_end_dot_

 it allows low budget candidates to compete and surge huck _meta_end_dot_

 and then a functional national primary comes a few weeks later so allows most of the country to have a meaningful say in the result although not me here in nc _meta_end_dot_

 all that said there may be better systems _meta_end_dot_

 i was fond of the idea of letting the most swingy state go first then the next closest margin in the past presidential election etc _meta_end_dot_

 there is also a good argument for the biggest r margin goes first then second etc _meta_end_dot_

 this encourages even solid red and blue state gop state parties to get out the vote and move up the list _meta_end_dot_

 not a bad little incentive _meta_end_dot_

 neil stevens the fact that is is a freak cycle that makes it the perfect model for why we need to be tweaking our system _meta_end_dot_

 we very rarely get a close race _meta_end_dot_

 our system must be able to handle the event that we don t have an undisputed successor _meta_end_dot_

 any system can work when we largely agree on who needs to win _meta_end_dot_

 it s the hard cases like this year that prove the worth of the system _meta_end_dot_

 note that this is even more true for the democrats than the republicans _meta_end_dot_

 their proportional by cd system with uneven cds is turning their close race into a lottery _meta_end_dot_

 our system may not be great but at least it s bringing clarity _meta_end_dot_

 thomas crown two things _meta_number_ref_ i like caucuses they encourage the folks who are most involved in politics to actually feel like they have a real voice once every four years _meta_end_dot_

 we reward the morons by letting them vote in primaries and general elections and having their votes count i don t see why the people who actually expend effort on this slide into the republic s dissolution don t deserve something for their efforts _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ i wholeheartedly reject this idea if only because what is a swing state _meta_end_question_

 florida was one until _meta_number_ref_ now it s not _meta_end_dot_

 ohio has been for a decade and change what happens if enough people move away _meta_end_question_

 is iowa really a swing state _meta_end_question_

 what is new hampshire _meta_end_question_

 where i m going with that is that following your plan the primary system rotates every four years based on data from one event four years prior _meta_end_dot_

 don t we have enough headaches and politicians doing retail politics without that _meta_end_question_

 dan mclaughlin the whole point of my mantra that ides don t run for president people do is that we should not overgeneralize about one cycle but that said i agree with neil that an open field year is more representative than one where the choice is the incumbent or the highway _meta_end_dot_

 and i side with adam rather than neil a primary is a good way to build interest and enthusiasm for the candidate _meta_end_dot_

 that trumps the more indirect incentives to get people involved in caucusing _meta_end_dot_

 thomas crown are you telling me that you were seriously jazzed about voting in new york s primary this year _meta_end_question_

 dan mclaughlin i was happy to have a chance to partcipate _meta_end_dot_

 had ny had a caucus i would have needed to take a day off work which for a lot of people with jobs and families who ought to be the gop s core constituency is easier said than done _meta_end_dot_

 thomas crown i ll concede that but _meta_number_ref_ as someone with a job and a large family i take participation in the process seriously enough that i m more than slightly irked that my participation matters no more than someone who only knows about the candidates what they see on tv _meta_end_dot_

 part of where we lag the left is in the number of folks we have seriously dedicated to doing the hard work of politics why not reward those who match that description with a greater say come primary time _meta_end_question_

 i don t see what else they get really _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ maybe i was insufficiently clear how does the primary as opposed to the caucus process generate enthusiasm for a candidate _meta_end_question_

 pejman yousefzadeh better late than never _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 the primary process did not fail conservatives _meta_end_dot_

 as victoria pointed out we are in a unique circumstance where there is no organized successor to president bush and there has been a lot of chaos as a result _meta_end_dot_

 however it should be added that what we are seeing is the result of market forces at work _meta_end_dot_

 this is widely perceived to be a bad year for republicans and as a result some otherwise strong candidates sanford pawlenty jeb who is burdened more by being a bush than being a republican sat out thinking that the electoral market was bad for them _meta_end_dot_

 as a consequence we got candidates of the moment rudy who wanted to capitalize on his heroism in the aftermath of _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ mitt who is ambitious huckabee who is _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 well _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 the less said the better and mccain who after _meta_number_ref_ is the heir apparent since he is next in line as it were _meta_end_dot_

 the philosophical divisions that we are experiencing are a consequence of this situation _meta_end_dot_

 by contrast the democrats got a lot of good candidates from the standpoint of the democratic electorate because this is widely perceived to be a democratic year _meta_end_dot_

 as the marginal revolution folks often say markets in everything _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 following along this thread the gop electorate did not want to choose a less conservative candidate but given the choices it appears to have cast its lot with mccain _meta_end_dot_

 as dan points out the only conservative candidate was my guy fred thompson and alas his candidacy imploded _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 again following along the thoughts above we get a more conservative or perhaps a libertarian conservative candidate the next time around assuming that the market appears to be favorable _meta_end_dot_

 i am not one of those who believes that we ought to pull an electoral eight men out and throw this election but there are plenty who are and who believe that if we do throw this election we will set ourselves up to be rejuvenated for _meta_number_ref_ or _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 if hillary becomes president there will be a strong impetus at least in the beginning for quality candidates to get into the race and take her on in four years though again i caution that once they get a hold of power the clintons like to keep it so we shouldn t even travel down this road _meta_end_dot_

 adam c pej following up on your second point _meta_end_dot_

 i think despite the current gnashing of teeth that rudy and huck could have truly lost a wing of the party _meta_end_dot_

 mitt fred and mccain have some appeal to each wing even if there were levels of distrust and dislike against mccain and mitt _meta_end_dot_

 i think the party again choose the most conservative candidate who has a chance of being elected _meta_end_dot_

 that s what it has usually done in my estimation _meta_end_dot_

 there s just a disconnect between the party voters and activists _meta_end_dot_

 activists have memories of m f the gang etc _meta_end_dot_

 regular voters don t have the feeling of a knife in their back _meta_end_dot_

 this is why i think mccain has a better chance of winning _meta_percent_ref_ of the r vote than mitt did and the fav unfav ratings among rs back that up _meta_end_dot_

 thomas crown that s probably right as far as it goes i d add that the voting public has a memory of years of glowy stories about st _meta_end_dot_

 john the mccain to incline them favorably to him _meta_end_dot_

 brad smith three questions are asked did the primary process fail conservatives _meta_end_question_

 did the gop electorate prefer to pick a less conservative candidate this time around and if not why do we appear likely to get one _meta_end_question_

 and how do we conservatives going about the business of ensuring that next time _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ we get a more conservative nominee _meta_end_question_

 did the primary process fail conservatives _meta_end_question_

 obviously _meta_end_dot_

 mccain is an extremely dangerous candidate for republicans to embrace because mccain has self consciously and in my view rather cluelessly but marshall whittman told him it was a good idea sought to recreate gop progressivism _meta_end_dot_

 progressivism is fundamentally unconservative progressives were largely contemptuous of the constitution with its constraints on government power and openly sought to drastically amend or even repeal the entire constitution _meta_end_dot_

 this is why there has been the near hysteria over mccain not being conservative you can go through votes and make an argument as adam diligently does that mccain is really conservative and in a very cramped way that is true _meta_end_dot_

 but what the limbaughs and ingrahams and some others recognize is that deep down mccain is anathema to the idea of limited government regardless of his positions on particular issues _meta_end_dot_

 mccain s dalliance with liberal issues big government response to global warming campaign finance efforts to regulate personal habits such as smoking boxing steroids eating etc and most importantly the fact that these always seem to be the issues he finds of transcendent importance is a reflection of his deep rooted progressivism which shows up in the corporate bashing in the patriotism vs _meta_end_dot_

 profit nonsense and in his constant demands for self sacrifice to the state _meta_end_dot_

 that all this takes place while calling us all my friends and vilifying in nasty obscene and very personal terms all those who disagree or stand in his way is indicative of the anti conservative that is anti limited government mindset at mccain s core _meta_end_dot_

 many thoughtful conservatives of the limited government stripe recognize this deep down but it is very difficult to articulate in the context of a campaign hence the claims of liberalism that on an issue by issue basis seem over the top _meta_end_dot_

 did the primary process fail conservatives in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_question_

 might as well ask if there s ice in antarctica _meta_end_dot_

 obviously it did _meta_end_dot_

 that does not necessarily mean that the process is bad however or generally set up to fail conservatives the gop electorate was inclined to choose a less conservative candidate at least again if we define conservatism as conserving the traditional core american political values which are the values of classical liberalism which is why conservatives in the u s _meta_end_dot_

 share similar view to liberals in europe _meta_end_dot_

 we know that because roughly two thirds of the gop electorate rejected limited government conservatism on super tuesday _meta_end_dot_

 people are correct in noting that there is no strong reason to think that romney could consolidate the conservative vote even if huckabee dropped out because much of huckabee s message is the same conservative progressivism of mccain _meta_end_dot_

 now the reasons for rejecting limited government conservatism were not purely ideological many conservatives simply did not believe romney and let s be honest some didn t like his mormonism and some were just envious of his success _meta_end_dot_

 but it is still interesting that as thompson and rudy fell by the wayside many of their supporters chose mccain s overt appeal to progressive big government values over romney s appeal to conservative limited government values on the grounds that they just didn t believe romney _meta_end_dot_

 ultimately they were more comfortable with progressivism than what they perceived as dishonesty _meta_end_dot_

 and that in itself indicates the atrophy of the limited government base within the gop and the way in which limited government advocates have taken their eye off the ball _meta_end_dot_

 now we hear that those who support limited government must now grow up and support mccain _meta_end_dot_

 that comes from many of the same people who refused to grow up and support romney when a candidate professing adherence to limited government values could still have won _meta_end_dot_

 aside the deeper adherence of romney and rudy to limited government in a way mccain does not have as opposed to the superficial description of mccain and rudy as moderates also explains why rudy supporters did not break strongly mccain _meta_end_dot_

 beyond all that we didn t get a more conservative nominee because of particulars of the process and the candidates in addition to the atrophy of limited government belief in the gop _meta_end_dot_

 mccain should have been anathema to conservatives at least limited government conservatives _meta_end_dot_

 however rudy the other early frontrunner was seen as unable to break mccain because of his pro choice stance _meta_end_dot_

 for many republicans the pro life issue outweighs all other issues and these voters are also often less attached to the limited government ideals of ronald reagan than the typical republican and though rudy was respectful of right to life and mccain was often not in the end mccain voted generally pro life and rudy did not _meta_end_dot_

 at the start of the year romney saw an opening all he had to do was get slightly to the right of mccain and rudy and he ought to sweep up all the conservatives over weak opposition of huckabee and brownback _meta_end_dot_

 but these conservatives wouldn t buy it _meta_end_dot_

 so romney emphasized it more _meta_end_dot_

 and the more romney sought to recreate the old reagan coalition the more many decided he was not sincere _meta_end_dot_

 in short as mccain sought to tear asunder the gop coalition to remake the party away from reagan ideals into a party of aggressive nationalism and big government progressivism romney sought to unite the party around the traditional appeals to limited government at least in the atrophied form in which those ideals still command adherence within the party _meta_end_dot_

 for this romney was endlessly excoriated including by many who favor limited government but lacked the wisdom to see the stakes at issue as a hypocrite a liar a panderer a phony and an empty suit mccain invoked reagan at every turn while betraying his core and making the most disingenuous distortions of others comments and for this he was rewarded as a straight talker additionally in a variation of arrow s theorem the order of matchups mattered _meta_end_dot_

 had florida come after iowa mccain probably would not have won it _meta_end_dot_

 same for south carolina _meta_end_dot_

 had maine led off instead of iowa huckabee might never have caught fire and romney s original early strategy might have worked _meta_end_dot_

 thompson simply disappointed on the trail but his biggest mistake was not getting in aggressively in the spring _meta_end_dot_

 no one wins the presidency who waits around to be drafted _meta_end_dot_

 by the time thompson jumped he was too far behind and too many volunteers had already committed to other armies _meta_end_dot_

 so the three major candidates who sought to some measure or another to be true to the party of limited government rudy thompson and romney all came up short _meta_end_dot_

 mccain simply picked up the pieces _meta_end_dot_

 how do we go about getting a more conservative nominee next time _meta_end_question_

 first we make sure mccain loses in the fall because otherwise he ll be the nominee next time _meta_end_dot_

 beyond that if what you mean by conservative is people dedicated to limited government which as should be apparent by now is what i mean then there are several things to be done _meta_end_dot_

 one is the intellectual rebirth of limited government conservatism _meta_end_dot_

 when i was coming of age smart young conservatives read meaningful books such as friedman s free to choose murray s losing ground thomas sowell s works or nozick s anarchy state utopia now they read pulp books that just attack democrats and liberals _meta_end_dot_

 i haven t read either amity schlas s book on the new deal or jonah goldberg s liberal fascism yet but from what i ve heard maybe they are a step in the right direction _meta_end_dot_

 generally our think tanks have become too immersed in minutiae not enough in the big picture _meta_end_dot_

 limited government is an inspiring vision but it has not been presented in inspiring ways and its intellectual roots have been forgotten by its leaders _meta_end_dot_

 second we need to articulate a true conservative agenda _meta_end_dot_

 rudy s _meta_number_ref_ points were a decent start but neither rudy nor romney really articulated an overarching vision of limited government _meta_end_dot_

 both rather seemed to operate a sort of check list conservatism tax cuts check wot check free trade check etc _meta_end_dot_

 thompson came a bit closer but his message was almost wholly reactionary _meta_end_dot_

 no one aggressively took the reagan position government is the problem and here is where we should prune it _meta_end_dot_

 third we ourselves need to recognize the stakes _meta_end_dot_

 many limited government conservatives supported mccain often from fear of hillary chasing the elusive electability sometimes you get what you deserve _meta_end_dot_

 but the first and most important step will be to admit what a serious mistake has been made _meta_end_dot_

 i m not sure most conservatives are prepared to do that at least not all those who backed mccain or swung to him rather than to romney late in the day _meta_end_dot_

 it will be a long road back _meta_end_dot_

 dan mclaughlin well of course i don t agree with brad that we should work to defeat mccain the result of that not only leaves us battling an entrenched incumbent in _meta_number_ref_ republicans have defeated an incumbent democratic president only twice in history but with the likely prospect that democratic appointed supreme court justices in the interim will create permanent barriers to limited government or at least barriers that will take many more decades of work to remove _meta_end_dot_

 whereas if mccain does win his age and issues with the base may yet make it possible to push him into settling for one term _meta_end_dot_

 but to some extent that s another day s topic _meta_end_dot_

 it s true that one of the problems here is defining conservatism brad s limited government axis does cleave the field with fred on one side of the line and to a lesser extent rudy and romney and mccain and huck on the other except perhaps on health care mandates and entitlements where mccain and romney switch places _meta_end_dot_

 but of course there are other axes along which you can split the field _meta_end_dot_

 for example the traditional conservative idea that government should reflect the moral traditions of the people puts huck on the far right side and rudy at the left edge _meta_end_dot_

 it was the nature of the individuals involved in this field that scrambled the primary electorate by splitting the conservative moderate lines along multiple different axes at once _meta_end_dot_

 brad smith i didn t say we should work to defeat mccain _meta_end_dot_

 i said if you want to get a conservative nominee next time you must work to defeat mccain this time _meta_end_dot_

 that was the question how do we avoid a conservative nominee next time _meta_end_dot_

 it s one more interesting conundrum the conservatives who went with mccain have locked themselves into though they either must hope for the candidate s defeat or recognize that they ll have a bad candidate from a conservative perspective again in _meta_number_ref_ years _meta_end_dot_

 also i think dan s numbers on defeating incumbents are misleading _meta_end_dot_

 in the meaningful sense of the word we defeated an incumbent in _meta_number_ref_ when lyndon johnson did not seek re election and again in _meta_number_ref_ when truman did not _meta_end_dot_

 so _meta_number_ref_ defeated dem incumbent _meta_number_ref_ lost _meta_number_ref_ won _meta_number_ref_ won _meta_number_ref_ lost that means over the past half century plus three of the last _meta_number_ref_ times a dem incumbent has been eligible for another term the gop has taken the white house _meta_end_dot_

 hunter baker just a couple of observations _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 i continue to be amazed at what a non factor george w _meta_end_dot_

 bush is in this primary _meta_end_dot_

 nobody wants his endorsement _meta_end_dot_

 nobody wants to be his heir _meta_end_dot_

 if you want a sign of a failed presidency i think this qualifies _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 mccain is a beneficiary of this failure _meta_end_dot_

 not only does he make a much more convincing military leader than he who looked great in that flight suite but he also was the guy with the right opinions about how to conduct the war _meta_end_dot_

 there have got to be people who have looked at their vote in _meta_number_ref_ and wish for a do over _meta_end_dot_

 leon wolf i am not even close to being one of those people and my opinion of bush is not that great _meta_end_dot_

 which should tell you the enthusiasm i am going to have for this campaign _meta_end_dot_

 you know i m almost certainly going to grudgingly cast my vote for mccain but when i got ruffini s well meaning plea for donations to the nominee the only candidate who could possibly have held that mantle by then being mccain on february _meta_number_ref_th i actually laughed _meta_end_dot_

 give money to mccain _meta_end_question_

 not in a zillion years _meta_end_dot_

 not even five bucks _meta_end_dot_

 that s almost two cups of coffee _meta_end_dot_

 brad smith let me also add to dan s government reflects morals that i think that is wrong _meta_end_dot_

 what dan seems to mean is that the candidates reflect moral principles of the people not that government does _meta_end_dot_

 after all rudy did call for a government reflecting the peoples morals so far as i could tell _meta_end_dot_

 of course romney tried to pull the two together as reagan did for which i ll note again he was excoriated as fake phony a liar a panderer and whatever else _meta_end_dot_

 maybe he was _meta_end_dot_

 but the worst that can be said then is that he was our panderer asking to do what we claimed we wanted _meta_end_dot_

 much is being said again about the need for people whom mccain has insulted and belittled for years to suck it up and grow up but we have mccain as the nominee precisely because too many republicans were unable or unwilling to grow up about the alternatives and understand that politics requires compromises and choices _meta_end_dot_

 moe lane there s also the fact that if conservatives actively attempt to stop mccain from winning the general election they lose either way either they succeed in which case the moderate wing of the party will ruthlessly purge them and proceed to woo back the independents and just woo national security democrats or they fail in which case the mccain administration will do the same thing _meta_end_dot_

 and in either case the party will be right to do so as the ultimate objective is to serve the country best not to serve a particular ideology best _meta_end_dot_

 put another way many people seem determined to conflate conservatism for the republican party when the reality is that the republican party stands for a set of ideals which are currently best served by a conservative viewpoint _meta_end_dot_

 and there is nothing so ultimately useless as a principle that prevents you from doing the right thing _meta_end_dot_

 ben domenech primaries didn t fail conservatives conservatives particularly fiscal conservatives failed the primaries _meta_end_dot_

 they failed by being unable to coalesce around a single feasible candidate they failed by following the lead of many who don t understand the direction of politics post w and they failed in many ways because of a complete lack of an ability to educate and guide the next generation of under _meta_number_ref_ voters _meta_end_dot_

 the direction our party is moving in my opinion demands that a shift be made either toward state conventions early or toward a more closed primary system which is functionally more representative of the base _meta_end_dot_

 this is not said because of the _meta_number_ref_ field but because of the changing demographics of republican voters and the need to establish a more clear line of activity _meta_end_dot_

 i think huckabee and mccain have shown us that early wins do still matter more than money or endorsements and that s a good thing _meta_end_dot_

 i think moving to a more rigid schedule would help that continue to be true and in most years though not in all years as this cycle showed that s a good thing for conservatives _meta_end_dot_

 the worst thing about this year s situation was not that none of these guys could seize the moment it was that the schedule strongly encouraged them to skip states entirely _meta_end_dot_

 republicans in south carolina new hampshire and iowa deserved to have a real decision before them and to have candidates who invested time to earn their vote _meta_end_dot_

 forget romney s choice to skip sc for michigan and nv as a tactical matter i don t think that s a decision that anyone should feasibly be able to make going forward _meta_end_dot_

 if they can do so without consequences it destroys the whole point of having to appeal to different states and communities building a well rounded candidacy instead of just one that panders based on location _meta_end_dot_

 primaries or conventions or even caucuses the important thing is having a schedule where these states actually matter needless to say if rudy had actually succeeded in his florida strategy it would ve blown the whole thing up _meta_end_dot_

 to give you an example of what i mean clearly wv mattered enough for romney to leave california and haul his way all across the country to speak to them _meta_end_dot_

 early small states should demand that kind of attention or the whole thing is pointless and we should go to a national primary day _meta_end_dot_

 the _meta_number_ref_ gop primary is a perfect storm of a wide range of uninspiring candidates uniting in a year when there is a clear lack of direction in the republican primary _meta_end_dot_

 go back to the elections of the past _meta_number_ref_ years and it s fairly easy to sum them all up to identify the biggest issues at hand with one exception _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 this really is _meta_number_ref_ all over again with fred as phil gramm best policies in the room but failing to live up to conservative hype huckabee as an eloquent evangelical version of pat buchanan and mitt as teve torbes millionaire teve torbes was a maverick candidate who had washington insiders running scared _meta_end_dot_

 he also had an undeniable animal magnetism that drove the ladies crazy _meta_end_dot_

 it was clear teve torbes had it goin on _meta_end_dot_

 mccain is the default dole esque angry old vet with his turn written all over him but it doesn t fit him as well because he spent so many years needling his own party _meta_end_dot_

 the one exception here obviously because there s no comparison for what he represented was rudy _meta_end_dot_

 and it s another sign of how unique his candidacy would have been and the opportunity he had to sweep in had he made some small strides in the right direction _meta_end_dot_

 but rudy s campaign was built to stop mccain it was built for an epic throwdown where giuliani would establish himself as being to mccain s right on several key issues and to be a guy who when the democrats are in charge instead of making deals with ted kennedy he would tell them to go shove it _meta_end_dot_

 for a wide variety of reasons as dan and i have detailed this rudy never emerged _meta_end_dot_

 his campaign didn t know what to do with itself after mccain imploded over immigration policy an implosion that was as much the white house s doing as anything else and was like one of those yankee teams that hires a bunch of players who just don t care if they lose in the wild card round so long as they get their playoff bonuses _meta_end_dot_

 without him putting mccain down for the count none of these other guys had the opportunity to surge because each of them seem less electable than mccain _meta_end_dot_

 as for how we succeed in the future the marketplace will be very different next time around _meta_end_dot_

 only huckabee is likely to run again in _meta_number_ref_ our field next time will in all likelihood consist of sanford pawlenty possibly jeb and possibly thune _meta_end_dot_

 any of these new candidates is at the end of the day perfectly acceptable to reagan conservatives and none of them split the base in the way that the odd group of misfits did this cycle _meta_end_dot_

 if this expected crew of candidates goes to iowa new hampshire south carolina and florida i believe we ll get a very clear view of who the next candidate will be and as long as our system is focused on enabling republican voters as opposed to interloping democrats that next candidate will be a conservative _meta_end_dot_

 so ultimately make some tweaks close the system a bit more but there s no need to blow this up _meta_end_dot_

 the problem lies with the conservative movement particularly fiscal limited government conservatives not with the system _meta_end_dot_

 mark kilmer and at long last a bloc of the conservative wing of the gop will have repudiated ronald reagan and moved on to the _meta_number_ref_st century _meta_end_dot_

 this will leave times in the wilderness forced from within the party are dangerous _meta_end_dot_

 the wing and the party having lost its power and efficacy will cease to matter _meta_end_dot_

 mark kilmer romney did not skip south carolina _meta_end_dot_

 he spent more time and more money had more tv ads there than any other republican candidate _meta_end_dot_

 just because he dropped out a few days early when it became clear the voters would reject him and that he d be competing against only ronpaul in nevada does not alter that fact mitt romney did not skip south carolina _meta_end_dot_

 this was never his narrative to write no matter how much his team treated it as such _meta_end_dot_

 ben domenech true but mitt has spent more money and run more tv ads in every state than any other candidate _meta_end_dot_

 kevin holtsberry a couple of things brad s disquisition on mccain depressed me deeply and will require mush more thought on my part _meta_end_dot_

 yet on another level it is simple for me i think mccain was is best positioned to win and keep hilary from power _meta_end_dot_

 i will take center right rather than left left _meta_end_dot_

 i have yet to hear a explanation that convinces me that romney really is a ronald reagan conservative rather than a non ideological politician who tried to win by capturing the base _meta_end_dot_

 i just don t see how his history can lead to anything but doubt _meta_end_dot_

 he never ran as a conservative nor governed as one _meta_end_dot_

 how can he be the standard bearer of conservatism _meta_end_question_

 leon wolf i agree with this assessment of romney and have from the beginning _meta_end_dot_

 a lot of the base rejected him for that reason with the end result being that we are likely to nominate a guy with a record of stabbing the base in the back that is three miles long _meta_end_dot_

 not in my mind the wisest strategic choice _meta_end_dot_

 i have never understood why in the world anyone would prefer someone who honestly tells them that he s their enemy that someone like romney who is a question mark _meta_end_dot_

 by that logic we should all prefer hillary to any of our current candidates _meta_end_dot_

 hunter baker this whole weeping and gnashing of teeth by many suggesting that by rejecting romney we have rejected true conservatism is one of the dumbest things i ve ever seen _meta_end_dot_

 leon wolf i agree _meta_end_dot_

 i think the valid criticism is that the voters have made an ill fated strategic choice w r t conservatism _meta_end_dot_

 adam c have you seen mccain s ads speeches or heard his robo calls _meta_end_question_

 he isn t running as i poked you in the eye he s running as the guy who can win the war the guy who will cut the pork the guy who understands dc is spending too much and the guy who will appoint good judges _meta_end_dot_

 my guess is very few people choose the guy who told him he s their enemy they choose the known quantity who was trustworthy and who agreed with them on a lot of their issues _meta_end_dot_

 those who put immigration _meta_number_ref_ went for romney _meta_end_dot_

 those who care about iraq the gwot the economy etc _meta_end_dot_

 went mccain _meta_end_dot_

 moe lane ok gotcha brad which is to say i understand more fully now _meta_end_dot_

 charles bird late to the party as usual _meta_end_dot_

 we had five viable candidates all of whom are conservative in varying degrees _meta_end_dot_

 since i m a mccain supporter i think the voters made the right decision and picked the best conservative who could win _meta_end_dot_

 so from that perspective the process worked but i d make a few changes such as removing winner take all and adding a western state to the pre super tuesday slate _meta_end_dot_

 that said i think the gop system for picking its standard bearer is superior to the dems _meta_end_dot_

 judging by the numbers their race is going to go to convention and it s going to be ugly watching clinton trying to lawyer her way to victory _meta_end_dot_

 but in a larger fundamental sense the process hasn t worked _meta_end_dot_

 we haven t nominated a viable movement conservative since _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 bush _meta_number_ref_ was a coattail rider and bob dole is a right of center moderate _meta_end_dot_

 the closest was george w _meta_end_dot_

 bush who unfortunately sold us a bill of goods and governed in a distinctly non conservative fashion _meta_end_dot_

 what can we conservatives can take from this _meta_end_question_

 to me we haven t adequately sold conservatism to the other segments of the gop and to independents _meta_end_dot_

 we need to sharpen our arguments and work harder at persuading _meta_end_dot_

 of course we need better candidates who want the job but i have no idea how to make that happen _meta_end_dot_

 judging how the races in both parties have evolved _meta_number_ref_st century politicking is going to be dramatically different _meta_end_dot_

 accessibility authenticity exemplary communication skills and a solid tv persona are much more important attributes than they used to be _meta_end_dot_

 obama tries to make every stump speech into i have a dream and it works for example _meta_end_dot_

 and for all of mccain s flaws and foibles he did better than his rivals in those four areas _meta_end_dot_

 huckabee did as well as he did because he s an outstanding speaker and he does it well on television _meta_end_dot_

 when romney was put to the test on television he looked awful _meta_end_dot_

 anyone see his comments about hunting squirrels and rabbits _meta_end_question_

 oy _meta_end_dot_

 i have to say that i disagree with brad not just because i support mccain _meta_end_dot_

 i don t think we have to dump mccain in order to get a more conservative candidate the next go round _meta_end_dot_

 mccain could help in this by selecting a conservative friendly running mate _meta_end_dot_

 the bottom line to me is that we are a nation at war and we have liberal supreme court judges who are trying to stay alive long enough for hillary or obama to get elected _meta_end_dot_

 that is reason enough to win now _meta_end_dot_

 i think we re taking for granted the bully pulpit that we have right now no matter how much it is ineffectually used by this president _meta_end_dot_

 it was supremely frustrating to not have that voice in the _meta_number_ref_s and we re going to miss it big time if a democrat gets elected _meta_end_dot_

 to me the better answer is to work within the system for change not dump the guy altogether _meta_end_dot_

 mccain has made some serious pledges in order to secure his probable nomination and it s our job to hold him to his word and raise holy hell if or when he goes off the reservation _meta_end_dot_

 if he sticks to those pledges we ll have a conservative president who will give us the best chance of winning both this war and future elections _meta_end_dot_
