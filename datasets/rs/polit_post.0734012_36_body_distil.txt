  what the heck promoted _meta_end_dot_

 it s thankfully not about a presidential candidate it attacks democrats and it should in fact be a great wedge between democrats and young urban lefties who love free wireless internet access _meta_end_dot_

 let s be clear on this every single freshman democrat voted for it _meta_end_dot_

 neil stevens the house just overwhelmingly passed the securing adolescents from online exploitation act a stupid and obnoxious piece of lunacy _meta_end_dot_

 then read on _meta_end_dot_

 it seems that all we have to do to get a ban on abortion passed is to call it the anti child porn bill of _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 this bill would require people with a wireless site to catalog all the people who use their site and report anything anyone might call a lascivious site using photos of young people _meta_end_dot_

 first off it s an unfunded mandate second no hard drives exist big enough to do this third it is illegal for private citizens to spy on one another and if the images are kept then the person with the wireless service is violating the law _meta_end_dot_

 but only two members of congress voted against it _meta_end_dot_

 ron paul of course he votes against everything and paul broun whom i assume is the only one who actually read the bill _meta_end_dot_

 what a cheap way to pretend you care about children pass a blatantly unconstitutional piece of crap force some poor businessmen to defend themselves in court watch the bill get thrown out and the public picks up the tab _meta_end_dot_

 is it any wonder the public is cynical and holds the government in utter contempt _meta_end_question_
