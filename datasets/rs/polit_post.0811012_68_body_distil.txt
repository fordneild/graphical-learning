  of all the tangled and intertwined threads of the global financial crisis a few have managed to capture the attention of the media and of people at large _meta_end_dot_

 collapsing home values of course _meta_end_dot_

 more surprisingly the arcane and technical collapse of the bear stearns companies and the aggressive response by the federal reserve which was called a bailout so many times that people now believe it was one _meta_end_dot_

 and then there s commodity price inflation which is a global phenomenon with many contributing factors _meta_end_dot_

 most people don t notice the prices of gold silver dry bulk cargo holds concrete nickel copper and scrap steel _meta_end_dot_

 but they certainly do notice gasoline jet fuel rice milk wheat corn and cooking oil _meta_end_dot_

 in a further display of how interrelated everything has become commodity prices already facing upward pressure from fundamentals increased demand from asia coupled with supply disruptions have gotten caught up in the mess affecting the credit markets _meta_end_dot_

 as a result i now believe that many commodities are experiencing a price bubble much like the stock market bubble of _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ and the housing bubble of _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 price bubbles are inherently unstable which means they always bust _meta_end_dot_

 they re also inherently insane which means they can go a lot farther before they do bust _meta_end_dot_

 where is the financial i e the non fundamental pressure on commodity prices coming from _meta_end_question_

 let s unpack it a little _meta_end_dot_

 more the key factor driving the ongoing financial crisis is the unwinding of leverage _meta_end_dot_

 for a few years ending in mid _meta_number_ref_ it was standard practice to borrow enormous amounts of money on highly liquid and globalized money markets and use the proceeds to buy medium term debt securities _meta_end_dot_

 and this made sense _meta_end_dot_

 if you could borrow thirty times your capital at very low interest rates and invest it in a delta neutral trade that earned no more than one percentage point you would have made a thirty percent return on your money before interest costs _meta_end_dot_

 of course if the trade went against you and lost three percent you d lose every penny you started with _meta_end_dot_

 but long before you came anywhere near to that point your short term lenders would call you up and ever so politely tell you to either put up more cash or liquidate _meta_end_dot_

 and by the way you d have until the end of the day to do so _meta_end_dot_

 that s how a lot of financial assets like mortgage backed securities suddenly got dropped onto the market _meta_end_dot_

 and as their value falls the margin calls keep coming and soon even financially healthy players are under distress _meta_end_dot_

 and they start selling completely unrelated asset classes like stocks to meet their cash requirements _meta_end_dot_

 that happened during the _meta_number_ref_ long term crisis and it happened last summer _meta_end_dot_

 how does this affect commodity prices _meta_end_question_

 because all the money that is flowing out of leveraged investments around the world has to go someplace at least until the dust settles _meta_end_dot_

 the natural destination for it is the us treasury debt market particularly the shorter maturities _meta_end_dot_

 but a funny thing happened there _meta_end_dot_

 back in september the federal reserve started aggressively cutting policy interest rates as it attempted to stem the rolling series of credit market crises that started in august _meta_end_dot_

 all of a sudden the dollar started accelerating its fall a trend which was already in place and short term treasury debt started getting incredibly expensive _meta_end_dot_

 that s when the stampede into real non financial assets like commodities got started _meta_end_dot_

 i remember writing here about the inverse linkage between the price of crude oil and the dollar starting back in october _meta_end_dot_

 gold which is a far smaller commodity than crude oil joined the party about three weeks later so far this isn t an unconventional analysis _meta_end_dot_

 but where do we go from here _meta_end_question_

 i think the dollar weakness is unsustainable and will slow down as the fed nears the end of its cycle of interest rate cuts _meta_end_dot_

 there has been a lot of debate about whether the fed pushed too hard on the interest rate lever even as their wide range of other policy responses has had beneficial effects _meta_end_dot_

 as a result there is a lot of inflation fear out there _meta_end_dot_

 ben bernanke is keeping his game face on about the inflation risk that he s creating _meta_end_dot_

 and from mid march to early april the new york fed took a series of quiet but unusual steps to permanently reduce the money supply _meta_end_dot_

 bernanke fears a repeat of the great depression more than a return to carter era inflation but he s not ignoring the latter possibility either _meta_end_dot_

 going beyond all that it just doesn t make sense for global investors to be parking so much money into commodities and euro denominated bonds _meta_end_dot_

 these asset classes can t generate the rates of return that investors ultimately must demand _meta_end_dot_

 that means that both commodities and the euro are in a bubble and it will have to bust _meta_end_dot_

 so we could see crude oil back down to _meta_dollor_ref_ barrel and gold at _meta_dollor_ref_ ounce soon enough _meta_end_dot_

 of course before it crashes oil could easily go to _meta_dollor_ref_ or _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 as i said bubbles are insane _meta_end_dot_

 where the de leveraging cycle ends up is a much tougher guess _meta_end_dot_

 there are lots of home mortgages out there that were purchased with borrowed money and someone has to end up owning them _meta_end_dot_

 at the moment much of this paper has landed on bank balance sheets where it pushes down capital ratios _meta_end_dot_

 that makes banks call in existing loans and keeps them from writing new business _meta_end_dot_

 this is the proximate cause of the economic slowdown we re now in if there is no government policy response this mortgage debt will necessarily deflate fall in price until it makes sense for investors to buy it with real money cash rather than with leverage _meta_end_dot_

 that s a bad place and we don t want to go there _meta_end_dot_

 the last time anything like that happened was in the early thirties _meta_end_dot_
