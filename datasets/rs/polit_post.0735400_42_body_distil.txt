  as a consequential figure on the world stage i can certainly understand why vladimir putin got selected as time s person of the year _meta_end_dot_

 for all of its problems russia remains a country with great sway and power and putin is therefore a key player on the world stage _meta_end_dot_

 his efforts to shut down a nascent democracy deserve mention attention and worldwide opprobrium _meta_end_dot_

 his efforts to reignite the forces of russian imperialism via bullying former soviet republics a likely recognition of the efforts being made by the breakaway ethnic russian enclaves of abkhazia and south ossetia in georgia to achieve independence this in response to any effort on the part of kosovo to achieve independence russia s withdrawal from the conventional forces in europe treaty and putin s own efforts to enhance his cult of personality and his political power at home should be of deep concern to any and all russia watchers _meta_end_dot_

 i continue to think that general david petraeus should have been selected person of the year _meta_end_dot_

 just as consequential as putin he used his talents for good leading the troop surge in iraq and helping to set the country on a path towards reconstruction political reconciliation and full re integration into the international community _meta_end_dot_

 but as i indicate above the person of the year award doesn t just go to good people though in this case a powerful argument can be made that a good person petraeus deserved it over a deeply flawed and power hungry one putin _meta_end_dot_

 the consequence of this award should be a renewed emphasis on the threats a belligerent russian government poses to its own citizens and to other countries _meta_end_dot_

 no this is not the cold war _meta_end_dot_

 not even close _meta_end_dot_

 but it s nothing to shut our eyes to either _meta_end_dot_

 or to put matters more succinctly see this _meta_end_dot_
