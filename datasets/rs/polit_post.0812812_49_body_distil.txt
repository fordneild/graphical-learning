  last night for all effects barack obama became the presumptive nominee of the democratic party _meta_end_dot_

 i am undecided on whether this is good or bad news _meta_end_dot_

 but some things are clear _meta_end_dot_

 it is increasingly clear that the economy is going to be the dominant issue _meta_end_dot_

 in exit polls from yesterday the dominant issue was the economy as i have noted earlier the american people trust john mccain more than barack obama on the economy _meta_end_dot_

 this basic fact is exacerbated by all the other issues such as race class identity and the other polarizing issues in this primary _meta_end_dot_

 read on _meta_end_dot_

 start with the fact that john mccain is more trusted than barack obama on the economy and incidentally iraq _meta_end_dot_

 then note that for democrats the economy is the overwhelming issue _meta_end_dot_

 then note that barack obama has trouble connecting with working class voters who have been and are even more likely to be the swing vote in the next election _meta_end_dot_

 it appeared that obama s margins in both indiana and north carolina were due to race _meta_end_dot_

 he has increased turnout but he has not fundamentally improved his appeal among working class voters _meta_end_dot_

 so let s replay that _meta_end_dot_

 he was not providing satisfactory answers to a fundamental part of the democratic base on the economy their biggest issue _meta_end_dot_

 he already has trouble connecting to those people _meta_end_dot_

 it is not an accident that half of clinton supporters say that they won t support obama _meta_end_dot_

 they are just like the rest of america _meta_end_dot_

 they don t trust him on the economy _meta_end_dot_

 the democrats are going to scream racism for the next _meta_number_ref_ months _meta_end_dot_

 but this isn t about racism _meta_end_dot_

 this is about their guy not offering answers that real americans trust on the most important issue _meta_end_dot_

 never mind elitism arugula clinging to guns and religion iraq security or any of the other issues _meta_end_dot_

 the democratic party is coming out of the primary in a terrible terrible place that is a lot more profound than race _meta_end_dot_

 their own people don t think that their guy offers answers on the most important question of the day _meta_end_dot_

 and the rest of the country agrees with them _meta_end_dot_
