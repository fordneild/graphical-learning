 specifically mccain said gov _meta_end_dot_

 romney wanted to set a date for withdrawal from iraq similar to what the democrats are seeking which would have led to a victory by al qaeda in my view mccain relies on one quote that romney said about seven months ago in a television interview _meta_end_dot_

 in answer to the question of timetables for the war in iraq romney said the president and prime minister al maliki should have a series of timetables and milestones to speak about in private _meta_end_dot_
