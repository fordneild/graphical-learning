  victor david hanson makes a good point here about the upcoming presidential election john mccain cannot beat barack obama by trying to blur the differences between himself and the likely democratic nominee in a bid to win over the mushy middle _meta_end_dot_

 my shorter interpretation of what vdh is saying we need is this better marketing _meta_end_dot_

 the fact is conservative turnout in _meta_number_ref_ was virtually unchanged from _meta_number_ref_ in _meta_number_ref_ so blaming our booting from majority status on the _meta_number_ref_ _meta_percent_ref_ of the base that sat on their hands on _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ is being willfully blind _meta_end_dot_

 we lost because we lost swing voters the center in massive numbers _meta_number_ref_d _meta_number_ref_r if i recall correctly from an essentially even _meta_number_ref_d _meta_number_ref_r split in the two years from _meta_number_ref_ to _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 and from all indications we still have a long way to go before we can claw our way back to narrowing it to _meta_number_ref_d _meta_number_ref_r later this fall _meta_end_dot_

 the first step to doing that over the long and short term is recognizing the fact that swing voters are primarily won through the marketing rhetoric stagecraft image management press coverage etc _meta_end_dot_

 the presentation and the public persona of the candidate including the baggage of the popular perception of the candidate s party matters a lot more with the average middle voter than his her policy positions _meta_end_dot_

 it s not exactly the most flattering picture of the part of the electorate that generally gets to decide who ends up giving the concession or in the case of democrats filing suit in the nearest friendly court or victory speech on election day but there it is _meta_end_dot_

 the thing to remember though is that this is no sign of stupidity it s a sign of disinterest _meta_end_dot_

 amongst these people are numbered some of america s smartest men and women in every field of endeavor _meta_end_dot_

 they are registered as republicans democrats as well as independents what they generally have in common is that they just do not actively think of or pay anything beyond passive attention to politics until maybe a week or two before election day _meta_end_dot_

 then everything they ve absorbed over the whole cycle combines with what they re hearing at the moment from their own subjective gut reactions to poll reports telling them who their neighbors are voting for to the disbelieving arch of the reporter s eyebrow to october surprises and then they go out and vote _meta_end_dot_

 it s with a somewhat embarassed twinge that i remember the mocking laughter that erupted all over the dextrosphere i joined in when in the aftermath of _meta_number_ref_ elected democrats and their claque of supporters in the press trooped into lecture halls to listen to george lakoff explain the importance of framing _meta_end_dot_

 e g _meta_end_dot_

 changing lefty unfriendly trial lawyers to lefty friendly public protection attorneys i admit i thought it was ridiculous _meta_end_dot_

 and quite frankly lakoff s specific substitutions were mostly ridiculous _meta_end_dot_

 however as it turns out his general idea deliberately choosing words phrases and ultimately narratives to direct for good or ill the public s perception of political issues news and events was not something to be dismissed out of hand like we pooh poohed howard dean s _meta_number_ref_ state strategy that is paying dividends for the democrats il _meta_number_ref_ la _meta_number_ref_ and possibly ms _meta_number_ref_ now _meta_end_dot_

 similarly the two years of the new york times and all the other democratic news outlets remember cnn s fortuitously timed broken government special deliberate framing and presentation of the controversies issues over terrorist surveillance iraq wmds judicial nominations torture scooter libby delay s indictment katrina the economy stem cell research and even social security reform was a linchpin of the democrats victory _meta_end_dot_

 vdh continues _meta_end_dot_

 true _meta_end_dot_

 in addition to abandoning the information battlefield the bush white house is the most guilty of this republicans allowed themselves to abandon the moral and ethical high ground by abandoning the principles they got elected on falling for the fiction that a majority could be forever maintained on the cheap by bribing voters with pork and hiding behind the president s skirts _meta_end_dot_

 tom delay and dennis hastert s abject stupidity in forgetting that they also had a mandate to govern independent of the president and their attendant failure to enforce any measure of republican fiscal spending discipline on their caucus cannot be overemphasized as another linchpin to the democrats victory _meta_end_dot_

 this lack of discipline is primarily responsible for creating an environment that encouraged their colleagues of weaker ethics cunningham ney etc to think that they could get away with not so petty larceny _meta_end_dot_

 as one would expect of a partisan and ideologue like me i strongly believe this is true if mccain provides a choice not an echo he stands a better chance of emerging victorious come november _meta_end_dot_

 there will be a lot of influential people institutions from outside the gop like the democratic flagships of the msm and from inside e g _meta_end_dot_

 the gop s pedestrian pencil pushing coterie of campaign consultants advising mccain to move left in order to appeal to swing voters independents _meta_end_dot_

 this will be a mistake _meta_end_dot_

 this would be fighting on obama s homeground and vdh is right you cannot out obama barack obama _meta_end_dot_

 quite frankly dazzling style beats solid substance in today s electorate one looks and sounds better on tv _meta_end_dot_

 and much as i do not intend to poke a hornet s nest by saying this it is the reason why i am forced to conclude fred thompson never would have caught on he was unfortunately all substance and virtually no style _meta_end_dot_

 he was like a restaurant offering food that s scores a _meta_percent_ref_ on being healthy and _meta_percent_ref_ on taste _meta_end_dot_

 such a restaurant is going nowhere but down there ll never be enough health freaks to keep it afloat _meta_end_dot_

 the thing to remember is that while swing voters do usually vote based on the surface superficial issues i e _meta_end_dot_

 style on the coverage labelling moderate mainstream versus extremist celebrity endorsements memorable soundbites appearing presidential nice rhetoric words like bipartisan and phrases like work with both sides to get things done work like magic etc _meta_end_dot_

 they can just as decisively be won over by the better argument delivered effectively with the aim to convince _meta_end_dot_

 like reagan john mccain has to find that magical combination of substance and style to send his message across in a way that will strike home and deep with the average american voter the bulk of whom can be persuaded _meta_end_dot_

 to use my favorite margaret thatcher aphorism first you win the argument then you win the vote _meta_end_dot_

 in my opinion mccain winning this election hinges on the question of whether he chooses to move to the center as defined by the msm or move the center to him by unapologetically pulling no punches and sparing no expense in winning the argument day after day newscycle after newscycle till election day _meta_end_dot_

 it s ironic but it just might turn out that john mccain of all people would be the man to make the gop publicly open fire on the bias of the nation s supposedly non partisan objective but in reality _meta_number_ref__meta_beep_ref_ democratic voting fourth estate _meta_end_dot_

 mccain has to find ad marketing men who will tirelessly seek and find ways to convey his message s on the economy on national security on the role of government on judges on healthcare on energy on spending on taxes etc _meta_end_dot_

 in a way that puts everything in the context of the best of the nation s past from its founding documents to the best that is still yet to come and the way his and his opponents policies will impact on the lives of those living today and decades into the future _meta_end_dot_

 after seven years of an administration that failed to do so mccain has to muscle into the public information sphere educate and tap into the natural optimism and aspirations of the american people _meta_end_dot_

 personally i think the coming fight is going to be interesting even if just for the opportunity to establish for certain if pure style and artifice is capable of beating substance if a completely manufactured candidate with no accomplishments beyond a certain oratorical skill and a messianic following in the press corps determined to shield him from harm can beat an opponent that is head and toes above him in every issue of substance that matters _meta_end_dot_
