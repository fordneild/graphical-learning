  i just finished a mitt romney townhall in nashua nh _meta_end_dot_

 he had around _meta_number_ref_ people according to the campaign _meta_end_dot_

 i had just come from a similar event in windham just down the road where mike huckabee had over _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 the huckabee event clearly had more energy than the romney event _meta_end_dot_

 one of the questions in this race is whether mike huckabee has a base of support beyond southern evangelicals _meta_end_dot_

 well i found an orthodox jewish state rep jason bedrick _meta_end_dot_

 watch jason explain why he supports huckabee _meta_end_dot_

 he also said that huckabee could bring reagan democrats back to the party _meta_end_dot_

 reagan did it by using cultural values and economic populism to cut into traditionally democratic ethnic voting blocs _meta_end_dot_

 like culturally conservative northeastern jews _meta_end_dot_

 could huckabee _meta_end_question_

 if this energy is indicative rudy giuliani could be in trouble _meta_end_dot_

 one reporter described his events to me as intimate update moving fast i botch the point _meta_end_dot_

 really it was about economic hope _meta_end_dot_

 and reagan offered a form of populism over goldwater who had a hard line anti deficit position _meta_end_dot_

 rep _meta_end_dot_

 bedrick made the point about offering something to the working class which was my point _meta_end_dot_

 my bad for moving fast _meta_end_dot_
