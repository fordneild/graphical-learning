  coming into today i thought that the court was primed in the heller case to affirm that the second amendment is an individual right _meta_end_dot_

 but i thought that the court would adopt the position taken by solicitor general clement stating that while the second amendment should be deemed an individual right the right should only be protected by an intermediate standard of review _meta_end_dot_

 such a standard would state that second amendment rights could be regulated if the regulation had a substantial connection to an important government interest with the burden being on the government to show the connection _meta_end_dot_

 instead after reading this and this i am beginning to believe that there are five votes for vice president cheney s position which states that second amendment rights ought to be protected by the highest possible standard of constitutional scrutiny one which states that regulations are only valid if they are deemed necessary to further a compelling state interest with no less restrictive means available to further the compelling state interest _meta_end_dot_

 again it would be the burden of the government to show that its regulations met this standard _meta_end_dot_

 and you don t have to be a lawyer to examine the language of the two competing standards to see which one would be harder for any governmental regulation to overcome _meta_end_dot_

 justice breyer appears ready to provide a sixth vote in favor of the proposition that the second amendment protects an individual right though he seems to favor the intermediate scrutiny protections advocated by the solicitor general _meta_end_dot_

 but a majority of chief justice roberts and associate justices scalia kennedy kennedy thomas and alito appear to be ready to go further and if the decisions track the tone and tenor of the oral argument they will _meta_end_dot_

 it should be noted that of all of the presidential candidates only john mccain supports recognizing the second amendment as affording an individual right with strict scrutiny protections _meta_end_dot_

 he signed on to the very same amicus brief vice president cheney signed onto _meta_end_dot_

 for voters interested in preserving and enhancing second amendment protections that ought to mean something huge _meta_end_dot_
