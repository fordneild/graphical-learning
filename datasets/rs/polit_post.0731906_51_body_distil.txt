  not that hugo chavez will pay attention to this _meta_end_dot_

 but he should _meta_end_dot_

 strange as it may seem to say this at a time when oil is flirting with the _meta_dollor_ref_ per barrel mark the price of oil will eventually come down and it will come down dramatically _meta_end_dot_

 when that happens a chavez led venezuela will be left high and dry _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 unless market competition is returned to the venezuelan economy _meta_end_dot_

 sadly that does not seem to be in the cards _meta_end_dot_

 and while dictators like chavez will remain insulated from the shocks administered to the venezuelan economy through his mismanagement the venezuelan people who lack the luxuries available to dictators will suffer mightily thanks to chavez s disastrous policies _meta_end_dot_
