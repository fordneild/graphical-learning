  here s another thing we re setting up in redstate v _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 we struggled with how to display a lot of useful information on the front page and came up with these tabs _meta_end_dot_

 the second tab will be something new we ll let you organize events in your area then let folks organize around those events _meta_end_dot_

 likewise we ll throw in helpful calendar reminders about elections the state of the union speech and things like that _meta_end_dot_

 the third tab will be the user diaries _meta_end_dot_

 like the present site you ll be able to see the most recent twenty diaries _meta_end_dot_

 unlike the present site but like the old site you ll also be able to see the total comments and the number of new comments since you last were at the site _meta_end_dot_

 but again we need your help to get us there _meta_end_dot_
