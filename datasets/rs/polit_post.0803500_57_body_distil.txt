  shouldn t we take that from this _meta_end_question_

 doesn t that make them bigots _meta_end_question_

 after all if an evangelical who votes for huckabee is a bigot aren t these people bigots _meta_end_question_

 of course the answer to all of this is no _meta_end_dot_

 but it is the logical conclusion to arrive at for those who have invested so much in equating a vote against mitt romney as a vote for bigotry _meta_end_dot_

 sadly too many otherwise sane republican operatives have invested so much in this narrative they cannot actually see that while a small percentage of people probably are anti mormon bigots a very large number just don t trust the guy or have another reason for not supporting him _meta_end_dot_

 some of those who have invested so much in supporting romney need to take comfort in something and imputing bigotry to voters keeps them from having to critically examine their spin and determining how they could be so out of step with so many conservatives who refused to get in line behind their generally shallow rhetoric _meta_end_dot_

 whether you like mitt romney or not support him or not are voting for him or not at the end of the day trust is the biggest issue in the calculus _meta_end_dot_
