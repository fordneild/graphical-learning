  i would like to say that i am surprised that this hasn t gotten more attention nyet _meta_end_question_

 equally of concern is the pavlovian tendency to attribute any problem in afghanistan to the fact that we have a presence in iraq _meta_end_dot_

 don t have enough agricultural specialists _meta_end_question_

 that s because they are in iraq _meta_end_exclamation_

 is the afghan terrain too mountainous _meta_end_question_

 it s because we are in iraq _meta_end_exclamation_

 does kabul not have an attractive enough nightlife _meta_end_question_

 blame the quagmire in iraq _meta_end_exclamation_

 if we are not already at that point we will be soon _meta_end_dot_
