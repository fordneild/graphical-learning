  robert levy bemoans the almost complete elimination of the contracts clause from our constitutional jurisprudence _meta_end_dot_

 and well he should here is an instance where originalists ought to prefer thomist jurisprudence to the scalian variety _meta_end_dot_

 though i do not cover it in my article one of the salient aspects of justice thomas s originalist approach is that he is less willing to heed stare decisis when it runs counter to originalist findings _meta_end_dot_

 justice scalia by contrast is more willing to let faulty opinions stand _meta_end_dot_

 in some cases he may be right and it may be too difficult to put the toothpaste back in the tube jurisprudentially speaking _meta_end_dot_

 but in others the thomist viewpoint is the way to go and too often justice scalia disappoints by not embracing thomist jurisprudential principles _meta_end_dot_
