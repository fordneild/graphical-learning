  i m a big believer in the idea that political campaigns on a national level are influenced very heavily by personality and character and thus much must be learned about a candidate by watching them in action rather than just ticking off issue positions and lines on the resume _meta_end_dot_

 you know the tune by now ideas don t run for president people do _meta_end_dot_

 yet even in this interconnected age even political junkies often seem to end up forming strong opinions about politicians they know only by record and reputation _meta_end_dot_

 there is bound to be another round of speculation on the way about who is and isn t an appropriate choice for the next entires on national stage starting with the likely gop running mate for john mccain _meta_end_dot_

 let s take a video tour starting with one of the top short listers minnesota governor tim pawlenty _meta_end_dot_

 here s gov _meta_end_dot_

 pawlenty on sen _meta_end_dot_

 mccain who he supported in the primary race though mccain lost the minnesota caucuses to mitt romney here he is explaining how those caucuses work here s a pawlenty press conference on fighting illegal immigration here s pawlenty in a crisis dealing with last year s bridge collapse here he is denying any interest in a vice presidential bid here s a speech touting mccain at an americans for prosperity event in florida here s gov _meta_end_dot_

 pawlenty doing an interview on mccain s behalf in new hampshire finally go here for a collection of videos of pawlenty s _meta_number_ref_ gubernatorial debates including his answer to an audience question about his top priority in his second term conclusion as the relatively youthful second term governor of a key swing state early mccain supporter and a guy who bucked the national trend by winning re election in _meta_number_ref_ pawlenty is denials to the contrary certain to be on every vp short list _meta_end_dot_

 on the plus side it s not hard to see why pawlenty s low key regular guy persona has gone over so well with suburbanites inclined to vote for minnesota nice and pawlenty would probably go over better with female voters than a crusty old timer like fred thompson or phil gramm _meta_end_dot_

 on the negative side he s not a very commanding figure and combined with his relative youth he ll be _meta_number_ref_ in november he s only a year older than obama there s a risk that he could get quayle ized by the media _meta_end_dot_
