  being a libertarian conservative i am as interested in the political fortunes of libertarianism as i am in those of conservatism _meta_end_dot_

 so naturally when thomas frank comes along to play a packerian role and declaim on the tragic irony of beltway libertarianism i have to wonder whether he has diagnosed some strange political disease in the libertarian community _meta_end_dot_

 after even the most cursory examination it becomes quite clear that frank s piece on libertarianism is as overwrought and inaccurate as packer s on conservatism _meta_end_dot_

 one cannot help but wonder whether packer and frank were frustrated funeral directors before they became pundits but each of them tries to pronounce as dead or dying a political ideology that refuses to conveniently fade away _meta_end_dot_

 libertarians are factotums of the establishment in washington _meta_end_question_

 i only wish _meta_end_exclamation_

 perhaps then the bureaucracy would be slashed the regulatory state scaled back and power given back to states and localities _meta_end_dot_

 it s not fair for frank to tease us with an untruth like that _meta_end_dot_

 some of us might become unduly optimistic about the state of affairs in washington _meta_end_dot_

 no we are not done _meta_end_dot_

 read on _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 since when are libertarians subsidized _meta_end_question_

 what on earth is frank writing about _meta_end_question_

 does he himself know _meta_end_question_

 it is the wealthy that pay the bulk of taxes which is why they get the most significant share of tax breaks _meta_end_dot_

 but let not the facts stand in the way of thomas frank s snarky commentary _meta_end_dot_

 i don t know why it comes as a shock to frank to learn this but here is a stark truth high paying jobs in the private sector will have salaries that outdistance those of people engaged in teaching the arts and of course nonprofit work tax reductions and market minded economic policies have had little at best to do with the phenomenon _meta_end_dot_

 actually private sector washington is richer because there is greater competition for private sector jobs many of which will require some time in the public sector so as to provide private sector clients with an inside view of how government works _meta_end_dot_

 private sector washington gives you a higher salary but less job security than your traditional public sector bureaucrat _meta_end_dot_

 still many people will take their chances with job security because they want the higher salaries _meta_end_dot_

 it has nothing to do with selling out and selling out is not how the market gets its way as anyone reasonably familiar with market economics would understand _meta_end_dot_

 but hey don t take my word for it _meta_end_dot_

 on these issues let s turn the microphone over to ilya somin who tears frank apart jonathan adler a turn at the mike tries to beat some sense into frank s head as well jonah goldberg who blows still more holes in frank s swiss cheese argument against beltway libertarians the worst kind of columns are those that seek to justify a particular position no matter how batty and then reason backwards to do so _meta_end_dot_

 frank s column is a prime example of such a specimen _meta_end_dot_

 overcome by hatred and disgust with the free market idol of libertarians he writes snidely and accusingly without a single actual fact to support those things he calls arguments in his piece _meta_end_dot_

 his column is replete with inconsistencies and incoherence and the only thing that it actually accomplishes is allowing frank to vent his spleen _meta_end_dot_

 which he is perfectly free to do _meta_end_dot_

 but why on earth did the wall street journal find it necessary to darken its column space by letting him do it on its pages _meta_end_question_

 by the way where were the editors when frank s piece got submitted _meta_end_question_

 were they on vacation or something _meta_end_question_

 couldn t one of them point out that there was more snark than substance to frank s piece _meta_end_question_

 and if this is the best that we can expect from frank shouldn t a your services are no longer required missive come down from the editorial offices of the journal _meta_end_question_

 i mean surely it can do better _meta_end_dot_

 can t it _meta_end_question_
