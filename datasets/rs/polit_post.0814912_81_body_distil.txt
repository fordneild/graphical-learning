  john mccain is a believer in seeing things with his own eyes as a result of which he has visited iraq several times during the current war at least _meta_number_ref_ at last count _meta_end_dot_

 mccain wrote in his _meta_number_ref_ memoir about how much his grandfather and father both admirals valued the ability to go face to face with the men on their ships and commanders and field troops on the ground to learn more about the men in their command and the developments in the war they were fighting world war ii and then vietnam _meta_end_dot_

 it s a lesson he s carried through to his role as a senator and now presidential candidate supporting the mission in iraq _meta_end_dot_

 barack obama by contrast has made just one brief trip to iraq in _meta_number_ref_ he s seen nothing of the facts on the ground since gen _meta_end_dot_

 petraeus instituted the surge and accompanying counterinsurgency strategy _meta_end_dot_

 obama may fancy his policy to be reality based but the reality he s interested in is years out of date _meta_end_dot_

 sen _meta_end_dot_

 mccain looking to take advantage of a classic opportunity to make political hay from this contrast while making an offer to actually educate the man who might well be commander in chief of our armed forces at war including yes mccain s two sons yesterday challenged obama to join him in a joint factfinding trip to iraq obama has now rejected that offer with the following response oh sorry that s what i heard when i read it _meta_end_dot_

 here s the actual wording with some window dressing on the same basic message read on _meta_end_dot_

 obama opposed the surge proposing instead to withdraw from iraq beginning in may _meta_number_ref_ with a complete withdrawal to be completed two months ago _meta_end_dot_

 the one thing obama can t afford especially while he s still courting democratic primary voters is to face up to new information showing that he was wrong or needs to change his preferred strategy the way president bush did in approving gen _meta_end_dot_

 petraeus approach _meta_end_dot_

 mccain is betting that americans want a wartime leader who actually cares what the war looks like from baghdad to the people charged with fighting it not what it looks like from the streets of chicago to the people fighting against the mission _meta_end_dot_
