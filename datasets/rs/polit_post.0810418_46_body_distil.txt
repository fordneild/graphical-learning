  by his own standards young barry obama is more than experienced enough to be president of the united states _meta_end_dot_

 we know all about his childhood travels to indonesia pakistan and other places _meta_end_dot_

 but of course with his remarks in san francisco he inadvertently reminded us of the low bar he has set in regard to experience _meta_end_dot_

 his desultory damage control hmm from your reaction it seems i expressed myself badly only reinforce the image of out of touch elitism he has now constructed for himself _meta_end_dot_

 obama s campaign is based on his quite correct recognition that politics and politicians are hated because they never tell the truth _meta_end_dot_

 he set about producing a product that would meet this underserved need _meta_end_dot_

 he got the marketing right but the technology wrong _meta_end_dot_

 he lacks the experience to know that in politics you never tell the truth _meta_end_dot_

 it just gives your opponents too much to work with _meta_end_dot_

 when barry learns this he ll be left with nothing but his not inconsiderable style and charisma _meta_end_dot_

 and it so happens that these are the things that really drive electoral success in america _meta_end_dot_

 but wait just a moment _meta_end_dot_

 there s something else in what barry said in san francisco and it really matters because it explicitly laid out the approach he would take as president _meta_end_dot_

 and you need to understand exactly what it was _meta_end_dot_

 more _meta_end_dot_

 obama said in so many words that people who live in benighted places like pennsylvania turn to guns religion racism ageism protectionism and xenophobia as an escape for their problems _meta_end_dot_

 but he also told us why they have done that because they ve learned to distrust that the government will give them what they need _meta_end_dot_

 he said it _meta_end_dot_

 oh yes he did _meta_end_dot_

 from helperin s transcript emphasis mine _meta_end_dot_

 here obama is revealing another truth which likely went down quite well with his disciples in san francisco but ought to alarm the rest of us the goal of an obama presidency will be to make progress via government action _meta_end_dot_

 he s accepting as a matter of unquestioned faith that this is the right thing to do _meta_end_dot_

 he has so much youthful confidence in his ability to do this that he s waving away mountains of recent experience that government activism has unintended consequences _meta_end_dot_

 and to him the political problem he must overcome is simply skepticism that government actually can improve the material conditions of life in ohio pennsylvania and elsewhere _meta_end_dot_

 this is truly noteworthy _meta_end_dot_

 what obama is telling us is that america needs change because the government has a bad reputation _meta_end_dot_

 he s glossing over all of the steps in the logic chain that implicitly led him to this view _meta_end_dot_

 let s examine them _meta_end_dot_

 first obama has learned his leninism well _meta_end_dot_

 to him government competes against religion and all of the other things that ordinary people value and cherish _meta_end_dot_

 but the rest of us know that government does not have a prior claim on what matters most in our lives _meta_end_dot_

 it s crushingly naive for obama to suppose that religion enters after government has failed _meta_end_dot_

 second can the government improve the material well being of our citizens evenly and fairly _meta_end_question_

 no it probably can t because it s susceptible to the fatal disease of power unchecked by alternatives or market forces corruption _meta_end_dot_

 third should the government even try to improve the material well being of our citizens _meta_end_question_

 well that depends on where you sit politically _meta_end_dot_

 many young well educated people have no hesitation whatsoever in answering this question affirmatively _meta_end_dot_

 but many other people remember a past history in which americans cherished their self reliance and the power of their own communities _meta_end_dot_

 in fact we had quite a discussion about whether we should have a king after we fought a revolution to free ourselves from another one _meta_end_dot_

 and we decided against it _meta_end_dot_

 and finally what about all the things the government has already done to destroy the material well being of our communities _meta_end_question_

 economies like people are flexible _meta_end_dot_

 they adapt readily to changing circumstances _meta_end_dot_

 but by overregulating trade and overtaxing capital and income the government has dampened this flexibility and done much to cause or exacerbate the economic distress in places like ohio and pennsylvania _meta_end_dot_

 obama has already promised much more of the same poison _meta_end_dot_

 the people for whom obama has so much condescension which is all the more grating for its benignity i m from the government and i m here to help you see very clearly the flaws in the logic which underlies his faith _meta_end_dot_

 they know that for all his naive talk obama actually is just this generation s embodiment of the infatuation with government technocracy which has wrought so much ill in their lives _meta_end_dot_

 obama is not a new thing _meta_end_dot_

 he s the same old thing wrapped up in a new package _meta_end_dot_
