  scotusblog notes that the state of louisiana in opposing a certiorari petition is pointing to a trend of adding child rape to the list of capital crimes as a basis for finding that it s not cruel and unusual punishment under the eighth amendment to execute a man who raped his _meta_number_ref_ year old stepdaughter this argument puts the court s liberals and swing vote justice kennedy to the test to see if they actually mean what they say _meta_end_dot_

 read on _meta_end_dot_

 if you recall the court in cases such as atkins v virginia involving the execution of the mentally retarded and roper v _meta_end_dot_

 simmons involving the execution of defendants who were under _meta_number_ref_ at the time of the crime has pointed to some variant of an evolving national consensus drawn from a trend in state statutes dealing with the death penalty as a basis for finding that the meaning of the eighth amendment has been changed sufficiently to extend the constitutional rule to force the dissenting states into line _meta_end_dot_

 in roper that evolving consensus consisted of four state legislatures and one state court changing positions between _meta_number_ref_ and _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 as i have argued previously because article v of the constitution provides a specific mechanism for the meaning of the document to be altered by action of three fourths of the states voting in a specified way on a specific written amendment proposed either by two thirds of the states or two thirds of both houses of congress this line of reasoning is hopelessly irreconcilable with the text of the constitution _meta_end_dot_

 but for now we are stuck with the doctrine the issue is its application _meta_end_dot_

 is it possible for the national consensus to evolve in a direction that justices who oppose the death penalty don t like or agree with _meta_end_question_

 or is this like so many liberal constitutional doctrines a one way ticket _meta_end_question_

 as i have explained before i personally don t support using the death penalty against ordinary individual crimes even those as heinous as child rape although i wouldn t really have a problem applying that law if asked to as a prosecutor or a juror _meta_end_dot_

 but in any event it s nonsense to suggest that it s unconstitutional _meta_end_dot_
