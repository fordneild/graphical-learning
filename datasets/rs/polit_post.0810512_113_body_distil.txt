  in case you hadn t heard there s an election this year and it s going to be an important one _meta_end_dot_

 inasmuch as the democrats are doing their level best to sabotage their chances to win the white house it s not a forgone conclusion that senator mccain will not become president _meta_end_dot_

 but the view from here continues to be that democrats will either hold steady or gain on capitol hill _meta_end_dot_

 so while i think the mood of the country still strongly favors conservative policies on a range of issues including the economy let s for a few moments try to discount what a democratic controlled future will look like _meta_end_dot_

 it doesn t take more than a touch of native intelligence to understand that if the democratic presidential contenders get their way we ll face an enormous amount of new government spending _meta_end_dot_

 but they re also talking about major tax relief for lower and middle income people _meta_end_dot_

 how are they going to square the circle _meta_end_question_

 read on i find it highly credible that either a president obama or clinton with continued democratic majorities in congress will seek to make the federal income tax sharply more progressive _meta_end_dot_

 it stands to reason that you can lock down the electoral loyalty of a great many non rich people by cutting their taxes _meta_end_dot_

 in a climate of recession reduced home values and high consumer price inflation the political moment will be right for a rewrite of the income tax _meta_end_dot_

 the logical place to go would be to fully eliminate income taxes except fica futa on all household incomes below _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ or even _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 income above that level would be taxed at a high flat rate essentially the current amt perhaps increased to the clinton era _meta_percent_ref_ or more _meta_end_dot_

 apart from its political benefits for the democrats this strategy would make permanent the current trend toward low growth in the us economy _meta_end_dot_

 at the same time the democrats will want to enact major new spending programs including increased federal support for state and local governments _meta_end_dot_

 this is a sleeper issue we never discuss much but you ll find it in every single democratic stump speech and policy initiative including the mortgage relief now working its way through the house _meta_end_dot_

 the national democrats are very well aware of the important work that their farm teams at lower levels of government do for them and of course there will be a national healthcare initiative stronger environmental and labor regulations a commitment not to reform entitlements and a continuation of the war on terror at nearly current levels the democrats will find it impossible to bring the troops home _meta_end_dot_

 all of this costs money but it won t come from higher taxation which has deflationary effects on the money supply _meta_end_dot_

 rather the democrats will discover to their delight that there are emerging countries all over the globe with central banks that have more money than things to do with it _meta_end_dot_

 they will continue to lend it to us at relatively low rates of interest _meta_end_dot_

 after several elections of fiscal discipline rhetoric the democrats will rediscover the joy of mainlining on borrowed money _meta_end_dot_

 now let s be quite clear about something _meta_end_dot_

 deficit spending is fundamentally a form of credit creation _meta_end_dot_

 it results in the creation of new money almost as effectively as if the fed printed it _meta_end_dot_

 and of course as a device for expanding the money supply it competes with the fed which is why fed chairmen tend not to be in favor of it _meta_end_dot_

 but in a world where money has no intrinsic value it ultimately doesn t matter how much of it there is _meta_end_dot_

 what really matters in terms of the material well being that people actually experience is the amount of goods and services that they can consume _meta_end_dot_

 and unless we enact policies that increase the risk adjusted rates of return on capital in the us our aggregate ability to produce goods and services will not increase _meta_end_dot_

 we face many years of low growth with moderate to high inflation _meta_end_dot_

 so what will be the effect of a large amount of new deficit spending in an economy that can t grow to accommodate the new money creation _meta_end_question_

 the effect will be to increase the relative proportion of our aggregate productive capacity that is disposed by the government _meta_end_dot_

 and as a practical matter that means that an ever increasing share of our total production of goods and services will be consumed by older people _meta_end_dot_

 our production mix will shift toward healthcare and low value added services like retail hospitality legal services and government _meta_end_dot_

 i m never entirely convinced by arguments against deficit spending that take the form it s unjust and immoral to mortgage our children s future by spending their money now saving is deferred consumption by individuals but the government doesn t save because that s a meaningless concept for an entity that creates its own money _meta_end_dot_

 by the same token there s no real meaning to the idea that our children and grandchildren will pay for our current consumption _meta_end_dot_

 someone always has to produce the goods and services you consume when you consume them _meta_end_dot_

 saving and investment do increase the amount of production available for future consumption if done intelligently _meta_end_dot_

 but in an inflationary low growth environment with low returns to capital it s not rational to save and invest _meta_end_dot_

 the american people who have uncanny horse sense when it comes to personal finance recognize this reality subliminally which is precisely the reason that saving rates are now at or below zero _meta_end_dot_

 the real effect of shifting so much economic activity to relatively unproductive uses will be to curtail overall economic growth _meta_end_dot_

 our children will pay for this as they fall behind the rest of the world in relative terms _meta_end_dot_

 and they will be less and less able to compete for limited resources with people in countries that are growing at faster rates _meta_end_dot_

 in sum a democratic ascendancy this fall will result in the enactment of policies that are precisely the opposite of what america s economy needs to start growing again _meta_end_dot_

 but there will always be people at the high end of the economic scale who will have the flexibility to participate fully in the global economy supplying goods and services for consumption in other countries _meta_end_dot_

 thus the democrats will also enact policies that will achieve precisely the opposite of one of their most cherished goals which is to reduce income inequality _meta_end_dot_

 john edwards may yet see his dystopic two americas vision actually become real thanks to democratic policies _meta_end_dot_
