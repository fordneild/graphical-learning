  barack obama is an addict _meta_end_dot_

 we need to just admit it _meta_end_dot_

 actually he needs to admit it that s the first step to recovery _meta_end_dot_

 obama is addicted to lying _meta_end_dot_

 he just can t help himself _meta_end_dot_

 another day another lie _meta_end_dot_

 today it s on the teamsters _meta_end_dot_

 the wall street journal reports obama wants to scrap federal government oversight of the teamsters _meta_end_dot_

 read on _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 heck the teamsters released audio of obama saying with the new york times _meta_end_dot_

 here s how this all actually works a judge would have to end the irb _meta_end_dot_

 but the judge would not do it without a decision from the justice department _meta_end_dot_

 so let s go back to obama s own words _meta_end_dot_

 according the wall street journal obama did everything he possibly could as a candidate for office to tell the teamsters that he would appoint an attorney general who would petition the court to drop the irb something the bush administration has refused to do _meta_end_dot_

 consequently he got the union endorsement _meta_end_dot_

 now obama is yet again running away from his position as fast as he possibly can _meta_end_dot_

 except he s not _meta_end_dot_

 yes he is clearly trying to have it both ways _meta_end_dot_

 the lengths at which dem candidates will lie for a teamsters endorsement is hilarious _meta_end_dot_
