  moe lane points to a jake tapper piece detailing the numerous times sen _meta_end_dot_

 barack obama has placed blame on his advisers for his radical policy positions _meta_end_dot_

 less noticed is the growing tendency for obama to drop those advisers like hot rocks the minute that their comments explaining obama s positions become known _meta_end_dot_

 it all started with the case of austan goolsbee the university of chicago professor and obama economics adviser who was caught telling canadian officials no doubt in english and french that sen _meta_end_dot_

 obama didn t really think that nafta needed to be renegotiated _meta_end_dot_

 it was all just campaign rhetoric goolsbee helpfully explained _meta_end_dot_

 the following week samantha power harvard professor obama apparently collects university professors and obama campaign foreign policy adviser told the bbc that obama had no intention of following the plan he had campaigned on for close to a year for getting u s _meta_end_dot_

 troops out of iraq _meta_end_dot_

 he will of course not rely on some plan that he s crafted as a presidential candidate or a u s _meta_end_dot_

 senator she said _meta_end_dot_

 but of course and pardon me but would you have any grey poupon _meta_end_question_

 power resigned from the campaign allegedly because in the same interview she referred to sen _meta_end_dot_

 hillary clinton as a monster but clinton s negatives are so high that it would have been hard for most of america to find fault with that statement _meta_end_dot_

 no the more damaging comments and the ones she was kicked to the curb over were the ones that exposed obama s real position on iraq and exposed him as a typical politician saying one thing to get elected while planning to do something else entirely _meta_end_dot_

 last week another obama adviser was unceremoniously dismissed for doing his job _meta_end_dot_

 only this time sen _meta_end_dot_

 john mccain s campaign deserves credit for forcing obama to reduce his adviser corps by one _meta_end_dot_

 mccain pushed back hard on the question of obama s relationship with the iranian sponsored palestinian terrorist group hamas and forced obama s hand _meta_end_dot_

 the incident further revealed the thin skinned nature of the obama campaign and provided a model that mccain should follow for the remainder of the election _meta_end_dot_

 read on mccain had been mentioning hamas stated preference for barack obama in some of his appearances in recent weeks _meta_end_dot_

 that prompted the notoriously prickly obama to respond that mccain was losing his bearings a none too subtle reference to mccain s age in the minds of the mccain campaign _meta_end_dot_

 that prompted the mccain campaign to issue a blistering statement reiterating the obama hamas connection _meta_end_dot_

 that s a pretty hard body slam from mccain who has stated his desire to campaign on the issues and avoid the negativity of past presidential campaigns _meta_end_dot_

 but obama s ties to palestinians have been known for a while _meta_end_dot_

 rashid khalidi who did a fundraiser in _meta_number_ref_ for obama represented the terrorist plo president yasser arafat in the oslo negotiations _meta_end_dot_

 the next day however obama middle east adviser robert malley resigned from the campaign when a british newspaper reported that he had met regularly with members of hamas as part of his work with the international crisis group _meta_end_dot_

 suddenly obama s debate pledge to meet with the leaders of america s enemies from mahmoud ahmadinejad to hugo chavez to kim jong il was more than just campaign rhetoric _meta_end_dot_

 a high level adviser was actually meeting with hamas who somehow got the impression that obama would be the best president for its interests _meta_end_dot_

 what exactly was malley telling hamas _meta_end_question_

 and was it on the obama s campaign s behalf _meta_end_question_

 we ll never know because mccain s aggressive pushback on the issue helped make malley the latest casualty of the rapidly shrinking obama campaign s desire to keep the candidate s positions from the american people until after he is safely in the oval office _meta_end_dot_

 at this rate if mccain keeps the pressure up obama may have no advisers left by the time november rolls around _meta_end_dot_

 with the pickings this easy mccain should make it a campaign goal to force obama to shed an adviser every couple of weeks just to keep him off balance _meta_end_dot_

 and obama advisers should be well aware that any statement they make or action they take on behalf of the obama campaign is a potential firing offense _meta_end_dot_

 the obama campaign is intent on assuring that the senator from h o p e or his positions and beliefs not be known to the public before the voting starts _meta_end_dot_
