  here s where i see this race today it s still rudy v _meta_end_dot_

 romney with rudy starting to exert a key advantage ramesh ponnuru wrote about a while back rudy has most of the rightwing pundits on his side _meta_end_dot_

 when romney talks about crime george will and deroy murdock can take him on _meta_end_dot_

 romney however seems to have more grassroots passion _meta_end_dot_

 but i think we might just see a turn in the cycle ahead _meta_end_dot_

 romney and huckabee are battling it out in iowa while romney and rudy are battling it out in new hampshire and everywhere else _meta_end_dot_

 that provides opportunities to fred in iowa and mccain in new hampshire _meta_end_dot_

 i think we re already seeing that shape up _meta_end_dot_

 fred has reached that interesting point where none of the other campaigns take him seriously yet he s starting to make inroads in iowa against huckabee who can t afford to spend too much time fighting off fred when he s trying to unseat romney _meta_end_dot_

 in new hampshire mccain long ago written off is seizing the rudy v _meta_end_dot_

 romney battle to make some inroads with independents most of whom will still vote democrat in _meta_number_ref_ and restore some ground lost with republicans who just might get tired of the rudy v _meta_end_dot_

 romney fight see e g _meta_end_dot_

 gephardt v _meta_end_dot_

 dean in _meta_number_ref_ in iowa _meta_end_dot_

 there s not much insight in this post admittedly but i think it s worth pointing out again that this race is still wide open _meta_end_dot_

 if fred and john play their cards right they just might restore serious viability to their campaigns _meta_end_dot_

 and then on the bright side we just might have to spend several more months hearing fred talk about federalism and john talk about warshington of course at what point do fred and john hurt each other _meta_end_question_
