  from its very first pages war and decision inside the pentagon at the dawn of the war on terrorism by former undersecretary of defense for policy douglas j _meta_end_dot_

 feith takes the conventional wisdom about the war on terror and throws it out the window _meta_end_dot_

 nothing literally nothing you know about the way that the bush administration planned decided and executed the united states strategy for fighting and ultimately winning the war can stand up to the scrutiny imposed by this consequential book _meta_end_dot_

 in twenty years when historians start to write a dispassionate history of the bush administration and its actions they would do well to start with feith s careful detailed and surprising account of the issues decisions mistakes and triumphs that america experienced in the early stages of its war against fundamentalist islamic extremists _meta_end_dot_

 throughout her history america has been fortunate to have great leaders at decisive times george washington and the founders abraham lincoln during the civil war franklin delano roosevelt during the great depression and world war ii ronald reagan after the decline of the _meta_number_ref_s _meta_end_dot_

 america s democracy by design or by providence always seems to produce a man for his times to steer the nation through turbulence _meta_end_dot_

 in the case of the war on terrorism there was not so much one man although george w _meta_end_dot_

 bush will ultimately be judged kindly by history for his principled leadership as there was a particularly important plane trip _meta_end_dot_

 on the day after september _meta_number_ref_th _meta_number_ref_ when america had been brought low from the skies by hijacked airplanes used as weapons it is both ironic and entirely fitting that the germ of the battle plan that would ultimately bring the terrorists to their knees would begin to take shape in the belly of a military cargo plane en route from europe to andrews air force base _meta_end_dot_

 read on on september _meta_number_ref_th feith was in moscow participating in return meetings with russian defense officials when news of the awful events at the world trade center reached him _meta_end_dot_

 he recalls realizing that broadcast news would be the best source of information about the goings on back home a sobering admission coming from the number three man in the pentagon _meta_end_dot_

 when events were finally confirmed in the early evening moscow time feith set about trying to figure out how to get back to washington _meta_end_dot_

 with commercial air traffic grounded across the united states military transport was the only option _meta_end_dot_

 due to the late hour it was impossible to get russian permission for a u s _meta_end_dot_

 military plane to land in moscow to pick up the pentagon contingent a complication that would turn out to have very fortuitous consequences for the nation s emerging war policy _meta_end_dot_

 by the time feith boarded the kc _meta_number_ref_ tanker bound for andrews from germany he had heard president bush s early references to the events as an act of war _meta_end_dot_

 out of contact with the white house and the pentagon he took it as a given that the united states response was going to be far more involved than its previous acts following terrorist strikes _meta_end_dot_

 there would be no cruise missile launches in the dead of night this time _meta_end_dot_

 the president was taking the nation into battle _meta_end_dot_

 also stranded abroad on september _meta_number_ref_th and returning to washington on the same plane as feith were peter rodman assistant secretary of defense for international security affairs his deputy for near east and south asia affairs bill luti and lt _meta_end_dot_

 gen _meta_end_dot_

 john abizaid head of the strategy and plans office of the joint chiefs of staff _meta_end_dot_

 the four men spent the five hours of the flight comparing notes and taking new ones on just what the pentagon s policy should be going forward in the post _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ world _meta_end_dot_

 key questions that the impromptu group discussed were who was the enemy what should the united states response look like how would success be measured where should strikes take place _meta_end_question_

 the answers to those questions would be put through the bureaucratic ringer in the coming month as the pentagon state department cia and white house decided upon the strategy in the emerging war on terror _meta_end_dot_

 along the way the answers met with general agreement from secretary of defense donald rumsfeld general disagreement from secretary of state colin powell and his deputy richard armitage foot dragging from cia director george tenet and his intelligence community operatives and blatant misreporting and mischaracterization from the liberal press _meta_end_dot_

 faith recounts all of these using quotes from heretofore unseen internal memos and snowflakes emanating from rumsfeld s prolific pen in a page turning narrative that destroys the well heeled notions that the bush administration s war on terror lacked a planning focus and a coherent strategic direction _meta_end_dot_

 from september _meta_number_ref_th feith depicts president bush as pushing rumsfeld who was pushing his staff to get the answers to the big questions right _meta_end_dot_

 that effort led directly to some of the early mistakes in the war and some of its later successes _meta_end_dot_

 chapter four begins feith s examination of the campaign against the taliban in afghanistan _meta_end_dot_

 in the next installment in this series the relationship between the big ideas formulated on that september _meta_number_ref_th trip back to washington and the trajectory of the afghanistan campaign will be explored _meta_end_dot_
