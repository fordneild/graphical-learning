  dan mclaughlin in today s campaign finance environment you can support republican candidates for public office in one of five ways correct me if i am missing something here _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 you can give to them directly through traditional fundraising _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 you can identify and direct donations to particular candidates through web intermediaries like rightroots big red tent and slatecard _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 you can give to the formal party apparatus the republican national committee rnc national republican senatorial committee nrsc or national republican congressional committee nrcc which then distribute funds to candidates as needed in their own judgment as well as spending money and running ads for more general party building activities _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 you can support a pac that in turn gives money to candidates although in general that similarly means letting the pac decide where they money should go _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 similarly you can support advocacy groups e g the club for growth that get involved in campaigns _meta_end_dot_

 let s focus on _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 a lot of conservatives have been formally or informally boycotting some of these organizations for the past _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ years in some cases due to protests on policy issues e g immigration but also in some cases due to frustration with the decisions made most notoriously the nrsc s decision in to pour resources into defending more liberal incumbents in primary challenges by conservatives in pennsylvana arlen specter in _meta_number_ref_ and rhode island lincoln chaffee in _meta_number_ref_ in chaffee s case in a losing cause that drained away resources that could have been spent in close races in places like ohio montana or virginia _meta_end_dot_

 the question is should conservatives give money to these organizations or some of them or none _meta_end_question_

 roundtable discussion below the fold _meta_end_dot_

 neil stevens yes conservatives should give to the national party _meta_end_dot_

 the rnc deserves conservative support for the same reason that republican candidates deserve our support _meta_end_dot_

 even when the party and its nominees are not uniformly conservative conservatives have an obligation to be team players in order to gain credibility and a seat at the table _meta_end_dot_

 not that i think all conservatives have to give _meta_end_dot_

 not everyone has the money or tends to give money to political efforts at all but i think those who do give should not leave the party out _meta_end_dot_

 however the congressional committees are an entirely different matter _meta_end_dot_

 nrcc chairman cole is getting noticed for his failure to intervene in primaries but i think we conservatives have no reason to expect this hands off attitude to continue _meta_end_dot_

 the congressional committees are run by the incumbents for the incumbents and giving to them can undermine our own efforts to steer the party in the direction of our preference _meta_end_dot_

 mark kilmer it s up to the individual conservative _meta_end_dot_

 the money is used to support the republican brand not per se conservatism so it s a nice spot to put your donations if you want to see your money go toward defeating dems _meta_end_dot_

 if you want to donate to a candidate who agrees with your conservatism give to the candidate _meta_end_dot_

 brad smith what if a person wants to support republicans running for senate or house but is not enamored of the presidential ticket where the rnc will spend most of its money _meta_end_question_

 isn t the nrsc or nrcc a better choice for that person than giving to the rnc _meta_end_question_

 dan mclaughlin if you support the nrsc and nrcc s approach yeah that s a way to do it _meta_end_dot_

 if not you are probably best off sticking with supporting individual candidates _meta_end_dot_

 personally although i have been holding back i will probably give to the rnc again at some point in the near future but the nrsc in particular i am done with _meta_end_dot_

 at least the nrcc serves some function it s hard for even activists to follow enough house races to know where and when to direct donations to make maximum impact _meta_end_dot_

 but in senate races it s easy enough to pick the people you like and support them _meta_end_dot_

 in fact it may be that the only remaining function of the nrsc in the future will be to beat back primary challenges _meta_end_dot_

 neil stevens good question _meta_end_dot_

 that might work to send a message that you re still on the team _meta_end_dot_

 because that s what it s about really conservatives don t want to look too selfish to the rest of the party _meta_end_dot_

 if we re ready and willing to take help from everyone else but disappear when someone not of our own is the nominee then our credibility in the party goes way down _meta_end_dot_

 leon wolf well the nrsc s most important function in the coming era would hypothetically be candidate recruitment _meta_end_dot_

 it doesn t help the nrsc s case that they have been spectacular failures in both _meta_number_ref_ and _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 for the sake of argument however we might consider that all of this should perhaps not be laid at the feet of the nrsc _meta_end_dot_

 smart politicians know that it s important to avoid losing your first big election and smart politicians could see the disaster coming in _meta_number_ref_ and cw has it that another one is coming in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 brad smith there is another consideration though which is that you can contribute a lot more money to a party committee such as the nrsc than to a candidate _meta_end_dot_

 so if you are a large donor and want to help the gop keep the senate that s a key place to give _meta_end_dot_

 adam c _meta_number_ref_ leon smart politicians know that it s important to avoid losing your first big election and smart politicians could see the disaster coming in _meta_number_ref_ and cw has it that another one is coming in _meta_number_ref_ well said and important _meta_end_dot_

 whining about the nrsc will not make gov hoeven nd rep capito wv or huckabee ar run for senate _meta_end_dot_

 the r brand sucks and the _meta_number_ref_ numbers look atrocious for everything except possibly mccain _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ donate to politicians you like directly or alternatively through a group you want to promote i e _meta_end_dot_

 club for growth redstate slatecard facebook etc _meta_end_dot_

 if you are big gun give to the rnc _meta_end_dot_

 feddie to me it s a question of stewardship _meta_end_dot_

 what have these organizations done with the money that has been given to them in the past _meta_end_question_

 i think the folks heading up these groups believe that party loyalty go gop and fear just think what the liberals will do if they take back the white house_meta_beep_ref_ are enough to motivate people to give but many conservatives are no longer persuaded by such tactics if they ever were _meta_end_dot_

 bottom line the rnc et al need to make their respective cases to conservatives _meta_end_dot_

 and right now i see no reason to give money to them _meta_end_dot_

 i would much rather give money to a candidate directly support the local or state party or fund other conservative organizations like the federalist society which btw has done more for the conservative movement than the rnc will ever dream of doing _meta_end_dot_

 dan mclaughlin true but the federalists by nature can t move the ball an inch if someone isn t out winning elections to put good ideas into practice _meta_end_dot_

 and as to adam s point well there s a self fulfilling prophecy there too _meta_end_dot_

 the brand won t get better by losing more elections and letting more territory go uncontested _meta_end_dot_

 pejman yousefzadeh i generally agree with neil _meta_end_dot_

 if the rule was that we could withhold support from the rnc whenever we are unhappy with its various choices then the rnc would be in perpetual crisis as moderates conservatives libertarians and libertarian conservatives in the gop have i missed anyone would be constantly threatening to withhold support _meta_end_dot_

 feddie brings up an interesting point concerning other organizations however _meta_end_dot_

 the good thing about the federalist society and other such groups is that they are very active in reaching out to libertarians and conservatives _meta_end_dot_

 the rnc and other party organizations should be and doubtless are aware of just how much groups like the federalist society are doing on this score _meta_end_dot_

 i am in favor of competition in all sorts of marketplaces including the political donations marketplace and so i would hope that the message would get through to the rnc and other party organizations that independent groups are doing far more to get our dollars than they appear to be doing _meta_end_dot_

 maybe that will get the rnc and other party organizations to be more effective and aggressive in reaching out to people who would naturally be their supporters _meta_end_dot_

 neil stevens for my part were i to donate for party recruitment and development i d give to state parties before i d give to the national congressional committees _meta_end_dot_

 leon wolf yeah but giving to all _meta_number_ref_ state parties or even _meta_number_ref_ or even _meta_number_ref_ is just not feasible for most donors _meta_end_dot_

 neil stevens no but if conservatives in each state look out for their own the job will get done _meta_end_dot_

 brad smith in the fwiw category back before soft money to party committees was banned by mccain feingold the rnc often gave funds to other conservative groups _meta_end_dot_

 leon wolf to neil this ignores the reality that many conservatives live in states where the critical races are all but guaranteed to go gop already _meta_end_dot_

 so while they may wish to give some money to their own state gop to maintain current levels they may have a more compelling interest in helping out elsewhere _meta_end_dot_

 brad smith to neil not necessarily _meta_end_dot_

 that is sometimes you can snatch a race with an infusion of cash from other states _meta_end_dot_

 giving to the state party in utah or idaho may not matter much if you want to win races this year in louisiana and new hampshire _meta_end_dot_

 kevin holtsberry i don t give money to the rnc mostly because i don t have it _meta_end_dot_

 but i also don t give them money because that means a never ending stream of solicitations and direct mail _meta_end_dot_

 it is like agreeing to spam for ten years _meta_end_dot_

 i would give them _meta_dollor_ref_ if they promise not to contact me for two years _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 i know nothing about high level donors but for my level it is much more satisfying to give to individual candidates on your own or via particular groups _meta_end_dot_

 dan mclaughlin yeah although actually i prefer to get spammed by the rnc than by _meta_number_ref_ different candidates _meta_end_dot_

 ben domenech to adam _meta_number_ref_ fine but out of your list only hoeven would ve won _meta_end_dot_

 huckabee was wise for his own part if not the party s best interest to avoid running for senate against a democrat with _meta_percent_ref_ approval ratings who s pro gun pro traditional marriage has a good position on the war hell pryor was one of two two dems to vote against withdrawal and who voted for roberts and alito _meta_end_dot_

 where s the deciding issue in that race prison reform _meta_end_question_

 as for capito she can t use the leverage of the gun issue or the abortion issue against her opponents because wv is entirely represented by democrats who are exactly at the same point on both counts heck the nra refuses to endorse in her races for that reason and she isn t even good on partial birth _meta_end_dot_

 rockefeller would ve kicked her ass _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ yes _meta_end_dot_

 adam c ben i don t pass judgment on their odds of winning _meta_end_dot_

 all were greater than _meta_percent_ref_ and less than _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 and your point is actually exactly my point _meta_end_dot_

 whining about the nrsc doesn t change the calculus for those individuals _meta_end_dot_

 making the r brand better or d brand worse in these states esp _meta_end_dot_

 wv and ar is what would help _meta_end_dot_

 whining about recruitment doesn t fix that problem _meta_end_dot_

 ben domenech i know this is off topic but since odds of winning tend to factor into these decisions i would actually argue that if shelley capito was pro life and better on guns and more pro earmark than her opponent which is hard to do when that opponent is rockefeller her odds would ve been more like _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 that doesn t exactly have anything to do with the r brand or d brand or with the nrsc _meta_end_dot_

 haystack i know i m expected to behave in this thread given it will appear in a post but let me suggest the problem lies in the question itself in deference to the unspoken reality of there being no direct correlation these days between conservative and the rebublican party _meta_end_dot_

 it seems the place to put the money nowadays is in the specific candidates the machine doesn t give a flip about your ideology they want your money to seat candidates that aren t democrats hell we can push for that for free at the ballot box why pay salaries to admins and techno geeks _meta_end_question_

 i say no no money to any of these bums give it to your local guys build the farm team there is much darkness ahead thru _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 mark kilmer i said something similar stack _meta_end_dot_

 if your first concern is your brand of conservatism you give to individual candidates _meta_end_dot_

 if your first concern is the republican brand and or defeating dems you give to the party there is something to be said for both _meta_end_dot_

 haystack agreed i m just madder about it br _meta_beep_ref_
