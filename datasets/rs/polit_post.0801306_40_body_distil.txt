  so it s a shame that he s about to get his heart broken via glenn well maybe not broken but it s going to get a good whack or two to it _meta_end_dot_

 read on _meta_end_dot_

 as i said brendan s a good guy good blogger too so he gets to be immune to the usual cheerful enjoyment i display when a democratic progressive leftist blogger gets a reality check like this _meta_end_dot_

 he deserves better he s just not going to get it _meta_end_dot_

 senator obama is going to let his people play the racism card against clinton thanks by the way _meta_end_exclamation_

 it ll be very useful against her in the general and to heck with the audacity of hope _meta_end_dot_

 the audacity of hope didn t win him new hampshire after all _meta_end_dot_

 of course the senator probably doesn t see this in the same terms _meta_end_dot_

 presuming that obama is actually bothered by this new tactic i expect that it would be very easy to rationalize it away as being a temporary gambit _meta_end_dot_

 a weapon that need only be used at need hopefully only once but surely no more than two or three times _meta_end_dot_

 such a light transgression really when weighed against all the good that the senator can accomplish as president _meta_end_dot_

 and does not the target truly deserve it anyway _meta_end_question_

 does she have scruples against using any weapon to hand _meta_end_question_

 besides one must be prepared for the general election _meta_end_dot_

 shrug politicians are politicians _meta_end_dot_

 i had about a paragraph of blathering following that but it occurred to me that i could sum it all up with those three words _meta_end_dot_

 unfortunately for brendan loy and i really am sorry for him he s going to have the same revelation fairly soon _meta_end_dot_

 moe lane i just said that brendan was going to be immune _meta_end_dot_
