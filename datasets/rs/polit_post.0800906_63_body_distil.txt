  so i had pretty much decided that if mccain beat romney in new hampshire tonight i d hop aboard the straight talk express since i don t particularly care for huckabee i don t think fred has a shot at winning and rudy well we all know how i feel about rudy _meta_end_dot_

 over the course of the last six months or so i ve gradually come around to the idea that i d be fine with mccain as a nominee my old boss endorsed him then curt schilling declared for him and he s generally impressed me in the debates _meta_end_dot_

 still i felt that romney would be a more trustworthy president on the issues that mattered the most and that he d overall make a better president due to a better temperament and more experience running complex organizations _meta_end_dot_

 still i was ready to happily embrace mccain as second choice _meta_end_dot_

 then a funny thing happened _meta_end_dot_

 read on _meta_end_dot_

 i was talking with a committed mccain supporter who shall remain nameless about this very phenomenon tonight as the primary results were rolling in and this supporter was giving me a hard time about waiting to see what happened in new hampshire before supporting mccain _meta_end_dot_

 this individual seemed to think that mccain deserved my support on the merits _meta_end_dot_

 as i started defending the decision not to make mccain my first choice it occurred to me i m still not ready to make mccain my first choice not even after tonight _meta_end_dot_

 frankly i m unsure how he got to be my second choice at this point after remembering all the ways in which i learned through constant reinforcement that when mccain is not begging for my vote he is not a man who can be trusted to govern from a conservative perspective _meta_end_dot_

 and i remembered all the times that once in office mccain s first instinct was not to mollify conservatives but rather to mollify our old adversaries in the mainstream media _meta_end_dot_

 by now the litany is familiar bcra bush tax cuts gang of _meta_number_ref_ imp pac and for some immigration _meta_end_dot_

 the problem in each of these instances and others that i have always had with mccain is not that he takes bad positions on important issues he does but that he does it in such a manner that is calculated to get the most media attention possible _meta_end_dot_

 i have often wondered over the years if there was anything he would not do to get on a sunday talk show _meta_end_dot_

 and that level of narcissism signifies a pretty significant problem when it comes to choosing a potential commander in chief especially if you d like that commander in chief to more often than not do things that the media does not like _meta_end_dot_

 i frankly don t know how in the world many of us in the party have collectively forgotten this except that the primary season has led to the demonization of all the other candidates in turn to the extent that mccain has flown under the radar the longest _meta_end_dot_

 folks earlier this year mccain was left for dead by the side of the road by virtually everyone _meta_end_dot_

 since that time he s been desperate for any votes he could get _meta_end_dot_

 he s saying all the right things and pushing all the right buttons with the exception of saturday night s debate he s been the sunny adult in all the debates _meta_end_dot_

 and somehow that s allowed us to forget that the man has a long and distinguished history the longest and most distinguished of any candidate in the race of stabbing us in the back at the worst possible moment _meta_end_dot_

 i should be clear i m still willing to support mccain in the general _meta_end_dot_

 mccain is easily better than any of the democrats and the intent of this post is not to make mccain sound like the worst republican presidential candidate in united states history as many posts about huckabee et al have done _meta_end_dot_

 my only point is that i don t understand how it seems to be that a consensus is forming that mccain is the consensus candidate for us unless we are agreeing that there is a consensus that we can all remember at some point swearing that we d never vote for the man under any circumstances _meta_end_dot_

 i mean for goodness sake whatever grievances various factions of the party have with huckabee and i do not discount that they exist huckabee has never treated any faction of the party with the disdain mccain has shown for all of them at one point or another during his long senate career _meta_end_dot_

 another reason to not jump ship for mccain yet is that romney is not dead _meta_end_dot_

 before this race became absolutely crazy in the last month i would have absolutely said that losses in ia and nh would have crushed his campaign _meta_end_dot_

 he is at this point still on life support but he s not dead yet _meta_end_dot_

 he does however need to reverse the trend of second place finishes and beat mccain decisively in michigan _meta_end_dot_

 if he can do that he s got a puncher s chance in south carolina and then _meta_end_dot_

 who knows _meta_end_question_

 anyone who thinks they can predict what is going to happen even a day in advance this primary season is kidding themselves _meta_end_dot_

 just go back in time to yesterday and ask everyone everyone whether hillary clinton was going to beat obama today _meta_end_dot_

 but the romney campaign has made some critical mistakes and absolutely has to turn some things around _meta_end_dot_

 it is critical that romney s people realize that iowa was not about evangelicals it was about the kind of campaign that they have run _meta_end_dot_

 please hear this someone in the romney campaign people start from a position of being skeptical of position changes _meta_end_dot_

 it makes them really angry when they perceive that someone who has changed positions recently is attacking someone else for the position that they used to hold _meta_end_dot_

 in other words for god s sake your man has a resume on which to run please stop unloading on every other candidate for every deviation from doctrinaire conservatism when you yourself previously suffered from the same flaws _meta_end_dot_

 this is just a harsh fact of life huckabee is in a position to throw stones on life issues you aren t _meta_end_dot_

 tom tancredo was in a position to throw stones on immigration you aren t _meta_end_dot_

 people feel like you re insulting their intelligence when you do this sort of stuff and in so doing you ve made so many republicans angry with you that i take constant crap from various quarters just for supporting you _meta_end_dot_

 stop in the hopes that it s not too late _meta_end_dot_

 run a positive campaign one that involves less scripts and every once in a while let people know that there s a real person under the hair who actually cares about something anything _meta_end_dot_

 the clock is ticking _meta_end_dot_

 one week until michigan and then it might be curtains for romney _meta_end_dot_

 after that time i may have to reassess where i stand and mccain will be part of that reassessment _meta_end_dot_

 but now that i ve had my memory jogged he won t be my automatic second choice anymore _meta_end_dot_
