  the most recent display of how true liberals feel towards americans who serve in the armed forces started with senator jay rockefeller proving that another great industrial family may have truly been spoiled by success and gone utterly to seed _meta_end_dot_

 rockefeller described john mccain s serviceas an aviator in vietnam as follows _meta_end_dot_

 mccain was a fighter pilot who dropped laser guided missiles from _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ feet _meta_end_dot_

 he was long gone when they hit what happened when they the missiles get to the ground sen _meta_end_dot_

 jay rockefeller said in an interview published in tuesday s charleston west virginia gazette _meta_end_dot_

 he doesn t know _meta_end_dot_

 you have to care about the lives of people _meta_end_dot_

 mccain never gets into those issues this was truly despicable _meta_end_dot_

 so bad that mccain s campaign wasted no time calling senator rockefeller on to the carpet to smell the pile he had left there _meta_end_dot_

 mccain spokesman and fellow vietnam pow orson swindle fired back an angry response _meta_end_dot_

 had senator rockefeller served himself he would appreciate and understand that most who have been to war emerge with a much deeper concern for humanity than they otherwise might said the former marine lieutenant colonel _meta_end_dot_

 if he knew what he was talking about he would know that john mccain wasn t dropping laser guided missiles at _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ feet in _meta_number_ref_ rockefeller s comment lacked the class that should always accompany a grand fortune such as the rockefeller estate _meta_end_dot_

 he proves that he is yet another stuffed shirt who inherited the fortune of croesis but has discovered that vast sums of money will never pinch hit for his dignity as a human being _meta_end_dot_

 since senator rockefeller supports the obama presidential campaign senator mccain called on obama to repudiate his attack lackey _meta_end_dot_

 read on _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 senator obama and senator rockefeller began their odious walk backwith a pair of thoroughly disingenuous apologies _meta_end_dot_

 senator obama has a deep respect for senator mccain s service to this country and doesn t agree with what senator rockefeller said said obama spokeswoman jen psaki _meta_end_dot_

 rockefeller s senate office released a statement by the senator that said he regretted the comment _meta_end_dot_

 i have deep respect for john mccain s honorable and noble service to our country _meta_end_dot_

 i made an inaccurate and wrong analogy and i have extended my sincere apology to him _meta_end_dot_

 while we differ a great deal on policy issues i profoundly respect and appreciate his dedication to our country and i regret my very poor choice of words both men were forced into hypocrisy by political expediency _meta_end_dot_

 each had to go through the public dog and pony show and repudiate what senator rockefeller and most liberal democrats sincerely feel about people who serve in the us armed forces _meta_end_dot_

 the comments of barack obama s supporters on the cnn weblog tell us exactly how liberals truly feel _meta_end_dot_

 user nx from va offered the following sentiments _meta_end_dot_

 april _meta_number_ref_th _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ pm et obama shouldn t apologize mccain is a warmonger who supported the iraq war despite lack of any credible evidence that saddam was a threat _meta_end_dot_

 and now he is singing bomb bomb bomb iran for no reason last thing we need is another pointless war while obl co roam around freely honkey white guy from cali was a genuine breathe of fresh air as well _meta_end_dot_

 he seems to think john mccain shot senator rockefeller with a mind control ray to manufacture the entire controversy _meta_end_dot_

 you just had to know it was all karl rove s doing _meta_end_exclamation_

 april _meta_number_ref_th _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ pm et ok _meta_end_exclamation_

 give me a break mc same _meta_end_exclamation_

 what did you hire carl rove over the weekend and some how cnn missed it _meta_end_dot_

 you have got to be kidding me there is tons i mean tons of conservative republicans on radio tv and the internet making all kinds of nasty comments about obama _meta_end_dot_

 some of those while he was there in present company _meta_end_exclamation_

 i think him not responding to mc cains obvious attempt to drag obama back down in the gutter and away from his message and campaign very sad_meta_beep_ref_ _meta_end_exclamation_

 remember hillary tried to do this to and she almost had him down there but he stood back up brushed off the pieces and went back to work on his campaign _meta_end_dot_

 better watch out campaigns have a tendency to explode after you try something like this the poster named abu articulated what will become the cnn corporate mantra between now and next november _meta_end_dot_

 the only thing missing was the punctuating exclamation point _meta_end_dot_

 april _meta_number_ref_th _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ pm et mccain and his campaign can eat slugs rockefeller s remarks themselves were stupid hurtful and the product of a petty doddering man _meta_end_dot_

 the philosophy behind them reeks of hatred and a lack of basic civil decency _meta_end_dot_

 like senator jon carey these sentiments are typical of how the leading liberal politicians feel about american soldiers _meta_end_dot_

 this is a critical distinction _meta_end_dot_

 these people don t just object to how the current presidential administration uses the military they specifically object to the soldiers sailors marines and aviators who serve therein _meta_end_dot_

 they find the decision to serve in the united states armed forces to be morally objectionable _meta_end_dot_

 this quite bluntly makes american liberals despicable human beings _meta_end_dot_

 yes some will object that senator s rockefeller and kerry do not comprise a majority of the democratic party and that the others really are different _meta_end_dot_

 my only question would be how so the democratic party draws the vast majority of its ideological support from the likes of liquidman over at kos who offered us his classic killitary post that posited the axiom that military training bred generations of psychotic killers _meta_end_dot_

 n b i had to link lgf on that post because kos ran from that one as fast as senator kerry ran from his vote in favor of the iraq war prior to election _meta_number_ref_ even the liberals who wear their veteran status on their chest like a red badge of courage and call others chicken hawks for offering a dissenting view from them on the current iraq war offer us the following commentary when contract security guards get killed in fallujah set on fire and hung from a bridge _meta_end_dot_

 here is america s most honest liberal markos maulitsas zuniga _meta_end_dot_

 the only man with the guts to state what the average american liberal really feels _meta_end_dot_

 let the people see what war is like _meta_end_dot_

 this isn t an xbox game _meta_end_dot_

 there are real repercussions to bush s folly _meta_end_dot_

 that said i feel nothing over the death of merceneries _meta_end_dot_

 they aren t in iraq because of orders or because they are there trying to help the people make iraq a better place _meta_end_dot_

 they are there to wage war for profit _meta_end_dot_

 screw them _meta_end_dot_

 so when some pathetic liberal politician says that he supports the troops but not the mission the answer is simple _meta_end_dot_

 tell him the following _meta_end_dot_

 be honest sir or ma am _meta_end_dot_

 you support neither _meta_end_dot_

 like your party s most recent president you loathe the military _meta_end_dot_

 do not waste anyone s time with your false and pretentious claims to the contrary i read the garbage that perfumed princes such as jay rockefeller produce and i find myself trying really hard to still consider liberals better than pseudo sapient devolutions of the human species _meta_end_dot_

 how a man who has spent his entire life farting through silk and eating off of silver can possibly accuse senator mccain of being a push button killer befuddles me _meta_end_dot_

 rockefeller and those who vociferously support his contentions don t measure up to any objective standard of class and decency _meta_end_dot_

 at best they are full metal jackasses _meta_end_dot_

 cross posted at the minority report correction that should have been croesus _meta_end_dot_
