  oklahoma democratic congressman dan boren s announcement that he won t be endorsing barack obama covered by erick yesterday is a moment of clarity _meta_end_dot_

 for much of the campaign people have been waiting to see how barack obama would pivot away from pandering to the democratic primary electorate to a general election stance _meta_end_dot_

 waiting for him to triangulate some distance from his base waiting for a sister souljah moment like in _meta_number_ref_ when bill clinton denounced that otherwise undistinguished rapper for her comment that black people should take a week off from killing each other and kill white people instead _meta_end_dot_

 obama has had to flee under pressure from his own chuch he s had to disown or distance himself from a variety of his associates but those were forced grudging acts in no case has he gone out of his way to demonstrate his independence from left wing dogma and on some issues like school choice he has instead come crawling back timidly after seeming to question the left s orthodoxy _meta_end_dot_

 by now it is clear unlike clinton or john mccain when obama is involved in triangulation it will be his own party comrades triangulating away from him _meta_end_dot_

 remember clinton made such a splash in _meta_number_ref_ precisely because these things had not been done in the past dukakis mondale and mcgovern never did anything to divorce themselves from the hard left of the party _meta_end_dot_

 by now it is clear there will be no sister souljah moment by obama because he is sister souljah the very sort of peace at any price you can never have enough tax hikes abortion in and out of the womb zealot that other democrats need to run away from _meta_end_dot_

 boren s not the first and he won t be the last one _meta_end_dot_
