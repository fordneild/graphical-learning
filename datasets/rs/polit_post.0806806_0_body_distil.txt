  the military recruiting office in times square is bombed _meta_end_dot_

 not much damage is done though because the bomber was an inept lefty _meta_end_dot_

 but it got me thinking with obama s ties to weather underground folks and being a closeted far leftist i have no doubt that we probably ought to be looking for someone audaciously hoping for change as the prime suspect _meta_end_dot_

 and that led to my poll question
