  today with the democrat majority continuing to accomplish nothing for the american people i was at least able to score a win for small business _meta_end_dot_

 over the course of this year i have been working to protect small businesses from the looming deadlines of section _meta_number_ref_ of the sarbanes oxley sox act _meta_end_dot_

 sec chairman christopher cox has now announced that he will extend the deadline just as i ve been working towards _meta_end_dot_

 small business is the engine of the american economy and the current sarbanes oxley regulations are choking them with red tape and paperwork _meta_end_dot_

 in fact sarbanes oxley has a stranglehold on american financial markets as well _meta_end_dot_

 earlier this year i offered an amendment to hr _meta_number_ref_ the fy _meta_number_ref_ financial services appropriations act with rep _meta_end_dot_

 tom feeney to delay these small business paperwork deadlines _meta_end_dot_

 our amendment passed with broad bipartisan support of _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ making it the first successful effort to protect american markets and good faith efforts by american businesses from the excessive sox regulations _meta_end_dot_

 ranking republican on the house financial services committee spencer bachus has also worked to seek a delay in these onerous requirements _meta_end_dot_

 like me he recognizes that it is essential we not heap burdensome new costs on our nation s small businesses but rather work to help them so they don t go overseas _meta_end_dot_

 by delaying this sox requirement we are giving our small businesses more time to ensure that they are not unfairly hurt without jeopardizing the accountability goals of the initial sox legislation _meta_end_dot_

 this is a step in the right direction and a win for small business _meta_end_dot_
