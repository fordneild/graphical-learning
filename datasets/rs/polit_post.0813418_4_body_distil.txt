  well it s like this greg davis ms _meta_number_ref_ and childers are going to do this all again in november anyway _meta_end_dot_

 so if childers loses he can give it another shot and hope that he can run without having to be linked too closely with barack obama whom he s never met remember tough to do if the democrats nominate the man but not outside the realm of possibility _meta_end_dot_

 but if childers wins _meta_end_dot_

 he then becomes a super delegate which means that he has to do one of three things so no real upside there _meta_end_dot_
