  last week we documented obama s _meta_number_ref_ endorsement by the new party which raises the question what is the new party _meta_end_question_

 it s easy to allege that this group is closely tied to former communists but digging in to the new party and obama s involvement a very dirty picture presents itself _meta_end_dot_

 in fact it is abundantly apparent that barack obama not only knew what the new party was when he sought its endorsement but through his ties with acorn the radical left activist organization obama used his radical left connections to get elected to the illinois state senate _meta_end_dot_

 most of the new party s history has been lost in the digital age _meta_end_dot_

 it was established in _meta_number_ref_ and started to die out in _meta_number_ref_ well before google and the modern web were established _meta_end_dot_

 but through lengthy searches of the nexis archive and microfilm at the local university library i ve been able to piece this together _meta_end_dot_

 the new party was established in _meta_number_ref_ by union activist sandy pope and university of wisconsin professor joel rogers usa today reported on november _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 the paper wrote that the new party was self described as socialist democratic throughout its creation and rise the new party sought to unite alienated leftists who had grown disgusted by bill clinton s embrace of the center left democratic leadership council _meta_end_dot_

 the wisconsin state journal summed up where the left was in february of _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 angry americans jesse waldman wrote particularly left wing democrats are tired of choosing between the lesser of two evils when they go to the ballot now a july _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ column in the los angeles times by todd gitlin which championed the new party as both old fashioned and elegant proclaimed the new party as a path to victory for leftists alienated by the democrats and republicans _meta_end_dot_

 capturing the mood of the left in a may _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ article for the leftist magazine in these times doug ireland wrote as bob master of the communication workers of america the point man for the new labor ballot line puts it the political perspective of labor and working people has no voice in state politics especially since the democratic party has moved to the right the seeds however had been sown all the way back in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 quoting john nichols in the march _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ issue of in these times the roots of the new party go back to the aftermath of jesse jackson s run for president in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 at that time dan cantor who had served as labor coordinator for the jackson campaign and university of wisconsin sociology professor joel rogers began talking about how to formulate an alternative between the increasingly indistinguishable democratic republican monolith it is no great leap to say as a result that barack obama s rise to the democratic nomination is the child of jesse jackson s defeat _meta_end_dot_

 understanding fusion in light of dissatisfaction with the democrats rightward drift the new party set about establishing itself as a third party third way for ballot access _meta_end_dot_

 fusion was the idea _meta_end_dot_

 continuing with jesse waldman from the wisconsin state journal fusion would allow a left wing candidate to run as both a democrat and a third party candidate _meta_end_dot_

 proponents of this fusion strategy include mary k _meta_end_dot_

 baum co chair of wisconsin labor farm and joel rogers a uw madison law and sociology professor who has helped organize the new party fusion is a pretty simple concept _meta_end_dot_

 a candidate could run as both a democrat and a new party member to signal the candidate was in fact a left leaning candidate or at least not a center left dlc type candidate _meta_end_dot_

 if the candidate let s call him barack obama received only _meta_number_ref_ votes in the democratic party against another candidate who received _meta_number_ref_ votes obama would clearly not be the nominee _meta_end_dot_

 but if obama also received _meta_number_ref_ votes from the new party obama s new party votes and democratic votes would be fused _meta_end_dot_

 he would be the democratic nominee with _meta_number_ref_ votes _meta_end_dot_

 the fusion idea set off a number of third parties but the new party was probably the most successful _meta_end_dot_

 a march _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ in these times article by john nichols showed just how successful _meta_end_dot_

 the wall street journal s editorialists fretted last fall about how the new party was responsible for a labor movement that was drifting leftward _meta_end_dot_

 as openly declared socialist rep _meta_end_dot_

 bernie sanders i vt puts it if the wall street journal editorial page goes after you you can pretty well bet you re doing the right thing nichols s article goes into detail about the new party s scope _meta_end_dot_

 after six years the party has built what is arguably the most sophisticated left leaning political operation the country has seen since the decline of the farmer labor progressive and non partisan league groupings of the early part of the century _meta_end_dot_

 in _meta_number_ref_ it helped chicago s danny davis a new party member win a democratic congressional primary thereby assuring his election in the majority black district _meta_end_dot_

 the threat of losing new party support or of the new party running its own candidates against conservative democrats would begin a process of forcing the political process to the left joel rogers argued fusion fortunately for the country died in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 william rehnquist writing for a _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ supreme court found the concept unconstitutional was not a protected constitutional right _meta_end_dot_

 it was two years too late to stop obama _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ onward to the socialist utopia the new party was designed as a loose confederation of unions socialists communists and black activists who shared common values but often had different goals _meta_end_dot_

 according to john nichols its party platform included in arkansas minnesota oregon and other places the new party has worked hand in hand with acorn and local unions to block public policy changes that have included prison expansion government subsidized stadiums and zoning changes to bring in big box stores _meta_end_dot_

 in _meta_number_ref_ missoula county montana commissioner barbara evans after fighting the new party over buidling a home improvement store told the oregonian they re bad news _meta_end_dot_

 i consider them socialist communist in their beliefs on december _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ after the gingrich revolution swept the democrats from congress and forced bill clinton to triangulate the chicago tribune ran an article by steve mills entitled looking for the left the old progressives and marxists still breathe idealist fire but they re too spintered to generate any heat the left is in crisis and it has been for some time said carl davidson the former national secretary for the radical students for a democratic society _meta_end_dot_

 i don t know if it s even bottomed out yet he reported to mr _meta_end_dot_

 mills _meta_end_dot_

 mills continued the socialist workers party is in this corner the international socialist organization is in this one _meta_end_dot_

 the communist group committee of correspondence is in another _meta_end_dot_

 the radicals or even the liberals with some radical leanings so called soft radicals seem to find it hard to abandon individual issues for a broader movement but mills reported it is amid this political confusion that the new party would like to step in _meta_end_dot_

 if there s anything that defines the american left it s fragmentation said dan cantor the party s national organizer the new party aims to change that _meta_end_dot_

 by uniting the progressives behind a cohesive ideology one that in theory at least will have room for all the factions that now litter the landscape of the left the new party is confident progressives can again be strong the new party acorn and growth steve mills writing for the chicago tribune spent some time surveying where the new party stood in _meta_number_ref_ chicago two years before obama sought and received its endorsement _meta_end_dot_

 although its chicago organization is not yet fully formed in other parts of the country it has run candidates in local races the races had at that time all been fairly small _meta_end_dot_

 however they had not yet fully connected with barack obama _meta_end_dot_

 dan cantor ironic given obama s preacher problems of late summed up his vision for the new party as it headed into chicago telling steve mills we re of that left tradition that thinks we could have a majority out there someday we want to build a church not a sect _meta_end_dot_

 because if the left is going to amount to anything it s going to be made up of groups have have reached their limit on one issue in _meta_number_ref_ the new party had moved into new york to be a major player _meta_end_dot_

 newsday s bob liff interviewed jan pierce the local organizer for the new party _meta_end_dot_

 pierce told liff that david dinkins was the type of progressive candidate new party members liked _meta_end_dot_

 as the party tried to take off in new york it was not only trying to get access to the ballot but to have some ideological purity in fact the new party had made such a name for itself that al sharpton had considered an attempt at the new party s endorsement for the united states senate _meta_end_dot_

 in _meta_number_ref_ newsday reported new party endorsed candidates have run in _meta_number_ref_ elections for school board and zoning board and city councils winning _meta_number_ref_ races including a chicago alderman s slot by _meta_number_ref_ the new party had solidified its ties with acorn unions and the left so much so that even the new york times referred to it as leftist manning marable writing in the left wing new york beacon on october _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ wrote that there are four key components in this strategy for progressive political change among those components were civil disobedience and support for independent movements like the new party which are running candidates in local races _meta_end_dot_

 more importantly an innovative approach to electoralism is represented by acorn s living wage referenda campaigns the chicago democratic socialists of america were quite pleased in _meta_number_ref_ with the new party s success including the election of barack obama victor in the _meta_number_ref_th state senate district who encouraged new party members to join in his task forces on voter education and voter registration _meta_end_dot_

 h t to rick moran in these times reported on february _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ that the new p arty with _meta_number_ref_ members in the _meta_number_ref_th ward many of whom are also active in the service employees international union and the advocacy group acorn has begun to build a parallel precinct organization obama s rise with the new party s rise and its entanglements with acorn came the rise of barack obama _meta_end_dot_

 according to stanley kurtz acorn is the key modern successor of the radical _meta_number_ref_ s new left with a _meta_number_ref_ s bred agenda of anti capitalism to match and barack obama was acorn s lawyer _meta_end_dot_

 using his position at acorn in _meta_number_ref_ obama set up the playing field for his election the following year _meta_end_dot_

 the boston globe reports obama was part of a team of attorneys who represented the association of community organizations for reform now acorn in a lawsuit against the state of illinois in _meta_number_ref_ for failing to implement a federal law designed to make it easier for the poor and others to register as voters _meta_end_dot_

 a federal court ordered the state to implement the law the globe also notes obama was part of a team of lawyers representing black voters and aldermen that forced chicago to redraw ward boundaries that the city council drew up after the _meta_number_ref_ census _meta_end_dot_

 they said the boundaries were discriminatory _meta_end_dot_

 after an appeals court ruled the map violated the federal voting rights act attorneys for both sides drew up a new set of ward boundaries with districts redrawn ingratiating himself to black politicians on his side of the city and rules loosened on voter registration obama could set out to run _meta_end_dot_

 and he did _meta_end_dot_

 obama sought the new party endorsement which required him to sign a contract that he would keep up his relationship with the new party _meta_end_dot_

 the end of the story is simple _meta_end_dot_

 obama won the new party s nomination and through fusion with his democratic votes he became the democratic nominee _meta_end_dot_

 using acorn s get out the vote efforts and relying on his gerrymandered democrat district obama moved on to the state senate _meta_end_dot_

 while there he paid back the new party and the far left _meta_end_dot_

 he opposed the born alive infant protection act he opposed legislation that would have prohibited the sale of pornography across the street from elementary schools and churches and he supported allowing criminals to sue their victims if their victims injured the criminals in self defense _meta_end_dot_

 fast forward twelve years and obama is running as fast as he can away from the new party brand _meta_end_dot_

 but beyond a shadow of a doubt barack obama knew what he was getting into and remains an ideal new party candidate _meta_end_dot_

 the new party was and as it still exists is an amalgamation of the left and far left designed to attract far left candidates and move the democratic party back to the left _meta_end_dot_

 barack obama is an example of the new party s success _meta_end_dot_

 thank god william rehnquist ruled fusionism unconstitutional when he did or there d be more of these latent communists on the march upward into the political establishment _meta_end_dot_
