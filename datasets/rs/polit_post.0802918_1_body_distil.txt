 bruce bawer is an american writer who happens to be gay and who left the usa in _meta_number_ref_ to live in gay friendly amsterdam and later oslo _meta_end_dot_

 please read those two links all the way through _meta_end_dot_

 note the bit about a malevolent theocratic movement too _meta_end_dot_

 no _meta_end_dot_
