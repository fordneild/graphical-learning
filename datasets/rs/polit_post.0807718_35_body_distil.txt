  the _meta_number_ref_nd congressional district of the state of florida is currently represented by a freshman democrat ron klein the former minority leader of the florida senate who defeated republican clay shaw in _meta_number_ref_ a very senior _meta_number_ref_ year veteran of the house _meta_end_dot_

 this is still a marginal district a purple seat with neither red nor blue having a distinct advantage even with the benefit of incumbency that ron klein currently holds _meta_end_dot_

 and it is one of those seats we need to start winning before we can have a hope of regaining a majority any time within the near future _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ saw the gop lose probably around _meta_percent_ref_ of every toss up race in the country and to make matters more _meta_end_dot_

 difficult we just lost our former speaker s nominally republican seat thanks to our side s nomination of someone who by all accounts was a terrible candidate _meta_end_dot_

 like dan would say it s people ultimately that run for public office not disembodied ideas ideologies or parties _meta_end_dot_

 read on below _meta_end_dot_

 in the case of fl _meta_number_ref_ we ve got ourselves two from all indications good candidates to take out the honorable ron klein d in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 both are veterans of the us armed forces one a former naval aviator now serving as a pilot with ups airlines _meta_end_dot_

 mark flagg s parents were killed on _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ they were passengers on american airlines flight _meta_number_ref_ which was crashed into the pentagon that tuesday _meta_end_dot_

 his campaign website is here but for some reason it shows up blank on my browser which is why i will not provide as extensive a profile of him as i would for the other guy _meta_end_dot_

 either way here is a picture of him and his wife at a florida event organized by howard kaloogian s move america forward in support of the mission in afghanistan and iraq in _meta_number_ref_ with debra burlingame sister of charles burlingame the pilot of flight _meta_number_ref_ in the middle _meta_end_dot_

 the second guy is retired ltc allen b _meta_end_dot_

 west a decorated veteran of the gulf war famously almost railroaded out of the army for firing a gun near a detainee s head in order to extract information on a planned series of ambush attacks including ambush attacks planned specifically to kill him because of his work and close relationships with the local authorities and tribal leaders as a civil military affairs officer _meta_end_dot_

 the said detainee an iraqi police officer had been fingered by local intelligence as a participant in the attack plans _meta_end_dot_

 according to the new york times not surprisingly sympathetic interview with the innocent victim out of fright he offered meaningless information induced by fear and pain _meta_end_dot_

 however according to jed babbin a more reliable source than the democratic party s flagship news outlet _meta_end_dot_

 the prisoner gave very specific information about the plot _meta_end_dot_

 he named the conspirators gave times and dates of the assassination plan and even described how attacks would be made _meta_end_dot_

 amazing how by all accounts strangely accurate and detailed a mind induced by fear and pain to invent something out of wholecloth can be eh _meta_end_question_

 by the way to show just how much more trustworthy than new york times jed babbin is his final recommendation was that the army should still reprimand and retire allen west _meta_end_dot_

 anyway ltc west was charged with violating the ucmj s regulations against assault and conduct unbecoming facing serving _meta_number_ref_ years of incarceration a dishonorable discharge and losing his retirement benefits _meta_end_dot_

 but then his case became public and _meta_end_dot_

 the good thing is that allen west has been very open and pro active about his case in his campaign which is certainly brave considering that the average journalist is going to strive mightily to transform the denotation of his partisan affiliation to something like t fl i e _meta_end_dot_

 torturer republican florida _meta_end_dot_

 this would be notwithstanding the fact that he very likely saved the lives of many of the men under his command by risking his _meta_number_ref_ year army career and reporting the incident unbidden immediately after to his commanding officer and also taking full responsibility for it _meta_end_dot_

 since his retirement allen west has been a high school teacher in florida s palm beach and broward counties and until november _meta_number_ref_ served in afghanistan as a civilian adviser to the afghan army under former us army chief of staff gen carl vuono s military professional resources _meta_end_dot_

 as you all might have guessed i recommend to the good gop ers of fl _meta_number_ref_ to vote for allen west to be their nominee against ron klein come november _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 this is not to denigrate mark flagg s service in the navy his life story or his sterling support of the mission in both iraq and afghanistan and or his hard work as a candidate so far in any way whatsoever _meta_end_dot_

 to me it is a matter of simple pragmatism _meta_end_dot_

 apart from being every bit as qualified as flagg allen west has the added benefit of being a veteran of the current iraq war _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ saw the democrats outshine us in getting veterans including iraq war veterans to run for office i e _meta_end_dot_

 say whatever you will but the fighting dems was an excellent attempt concept to neutralize the traditional democratic weakness on military issues and to bolster the subtle republican chickenhawk meme the democrats have been pushing since _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 for a party that routinely receives _meta_percent_ref_ of the military vote that was a little embarrassing _meta_end_dot_

 another advantage and let s be honest here is that ltc west is an african american _meta_end_dot_

 the fact of the matter may be that using race as a thumb on the scale is traditionally seen by the right as the beginning of the slippery slope toward using race as the factor but i believe the time has come for conservatives to comes to grips with the lack of elected minorities in the party and what it continues to do to our image _meta_end_dot_

 democrats and their media surrogates have used the lack of elected minorities in the gop to great effect in pushing the conventional wisdom that the gop has a closed door policy to non whites as the reason why we regularly lose minority votes to the democrats _meta_end_dot_

 this has done a great deal of damage to our image especially with swing voters who are famously not prone to voting based on issues but on image and conventional wisdom _meta_end_dot_

 this hurts us and hurts us bad _meta_end_dot_

 to illustrate just how serious this is let me say that i ve encountered numerous foreigners from in europe africa and asia who are shocked when it comes out that i m a republican because what they have been led to believe from american and foreign news outlets and the american movies and tv shows they watch is that the gop is the party of white america _meta_end_dot_

 worse i ve encountered even more non affiliated politically apathetic americans i e _meta_end_dot_

 the typical perennial swing voter and undecided who have the right and sometimes do indeed vote who say the same thing _meta_end_dot_

 these are the people who feel the need to hide the fact that they voted gop for some reason or other in mixed race company for fear that they would be inadvertently outing themselves as racists or racially insensitive even when there is not a single prejudiced bone in their body _meta_end_dot_

 we need to work harder to get minority republicans elected and let s be honest opportunities like this are rare and hard to come by _meta_end_dot_

 i still cannot comprehend _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ il gop chair judy baar topinka s idiotic decision to import alan keyes all the way from maryland to replace jack ryan who never should have dropped out i still don t understand dropping out of a race because of a sex scandal when it involves you and your wife _meta_end_dot_

 on the ballot _meta_end_dot_

 a major opportunity was lost because we had an impressive and accomplished potential candidate in chirinjeev kathuria a chicagoan since he was eight months old who had actually competed in the illinois us senate primary that year _meta_end_dot_

 one can only imagine the huge amount of editing the msm would have had to engage in to make sure the guy in the turban on the senate floor doesn t appear in any broadcast people might decide to investigate further and find out that the guy is gasp a republican _meta_end_exclamation_

 make no mistake the addition of allen west to florida s gop delegation to the us house of representatives would be just about as torturous an experience as jindal s victory in racist when the state votes gop of course louisiana was for the left and he would be faced with a regular barrage of oreo traitor and uncle tom catcalls from the likes of obama s pastor and their acolytes _meta_end_dot_

 which is even more reason why we should pick him over a not unworthy mark flagg _meta_end_dot_

 if we succeed in getting him into congress even if not in _meta_number_ref_ but _meta_number_ref_ we can vault west into the senate against bill nelson or whoever in _meta_number_ref_ and mark flagg can get his chance to represent fl _meta_number_ref_ then _meta_end_dot_

 we really need to get rid of this image as the white party _meta_end_dot_

 it s a major drag on our future as a viable party _meta_end_dot_

 we happen to have a great candidate in west who makes both great short and long term strategic sense _meta_end_dot_

 and we need more a heck of a lot more _meta_end_dot_

 so i once again suggest we especially those of us in fl _meta_number_ref_ start with a highly decorated and highly regarded officer who decided that the lives of his men were more important than his career and even more importantly his reputation _meta_end_dot_

 author s note this is a bit longer a diary than i expected _meta_end_dot_

 sorry _meta_end_exclamation_
