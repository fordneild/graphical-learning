 on fox news sunday this am host chris wallace spent a while speaking with two campaign surrogates governor tims pawlenty of minnesota for mccain and kaine of virginia for obama _meta_end_dot_

 both men could be veep choices and wallace joked that they could consider this something of an american idol audition for the jobs _meta_end_dot_

 kaine argued that obama won the white crossover vote in the dem nominating process and he could win virginia where the rcp average has him trailing mccain by only _meta_number_ref_ percent _meta_end_dot_

 the rcp average has barry up by _meta_number_ref_ points in minnesota where no republican has won since nixon in _meta_number_ref_ and pawlenty countered that his state is becoming more competitive _meta_end_dot_

 he cited some survey usa poll which has mccain winning minnesota _meta_end_dot_

 on taxes kaine argued that obama wants to cut taxes on the middle class while mccain would continue the bush economic policy _meta_end_dot_

 hillary talked about the historic unprecedented breakthrough significant dramatic and earth shaking nature of her campaign and how kids sold their bicycles and old ladies demanded absentee ballots from their death beds in order to support her candidacy _meta_end_dot_

 when barry showed up dianne simply brought them an estimated three glasses of water each _meta_end_dot_

 she evidently could not entrust the serving girl with such a sensitive task the talk was private and neither discussed it when it had ended _meta_end_dot_

 dianne is a big fan of hillary for veep _meta_end_dot_

 after their private talk which no doubt centered on that it seems obvious what hillary wants steph brought up the damper the democrats elder statesman threw on that notion last week when jimmy carter called an obama clinton ticket the worst of both worlds an african american and a woman dianne countered that hillary brings a movement to the party _meta_end_dot_

 feinstein complained that she had read column after column after column trashing hillary _meta_end_dot_

 steph asked about hillary s baggage being a hindrance to her veep chances and feinstein countered everyone has baggage not as deleterious as the former president dianne feinstein said that hillary is so much the apparent choice that she does not think of other women as potential barry veeps _meta_end_dot_
