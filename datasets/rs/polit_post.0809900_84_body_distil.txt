  my last post dealt with seven untruths that have come out of the mouth of barack obama _meta_end_dot_

 the economist has found three more and obama is still trotting out the lie that john mccain wants a _meta_number_ref_ year war in iraq _meta_end_dot_

 maybe i m a little naive but i thought that one of the primary tasks our media has is to hold politicians words accountable _meta_end_dot_

 alas _meta_end_dot_

 perhaps like chris matthews there are thrills going up their legs when they re in his presence _meta_end_dot_

 what will it take for them to overcome their bedazzlement and do their jobs _meta_end_question_
