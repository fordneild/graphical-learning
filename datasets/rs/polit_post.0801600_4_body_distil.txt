  if history has taught us anything it is that being a clinton means it is never your fault _meta_end_dot_

 not surprisingly hillary s presidential campaign continues the clinton tradition of blaming others for your problems _meta_end_dot_

 lost in hillary s surprise win in new hampshire was the desperate flailing of bill and hillary when they were expecting defeat _meta_end_dot_

 they sought to lay the blame for her poor performance on anyone but the candidate herself _meta_end_dot_

 it must infuriate the former first couple to no end that someone like obama would get in the way of their path to glory _meta_end_dot_

 bill always saw himself as a jfk figure and yet now finds his wife s opponent taking that mantle _meta_end_dot_

 similarly hillary once came to washington with idealism and big ideas only to have them crushed by her husband s opponents _meta_end_dot_

 now along comes obama running on the themes of _meta_number_ref_ while promising to turn the page the disdain her campaign feels toward obama is palpable _meta_end_dot_

 this emotion came out in the immediate aftermath of her iowa loss _meta_end_dot_

 the first reaction was to belittle iowa as a small state with no real impact _meta_end_dot_

 sensing this was not a good tactic hillary quickly moved on from sour grapes to attempts to contrast her action with her opponents talk _meta_end_dot_

 this strategy however was often as awkward as her earlier attempts to go negative _meta_end_dot_

 read on _meta_end_dot_

 in one cringe inducing moment she seemed to disparage martin luther king jr _meta_end_dot_

 as an idealist who never accomplished anything in contrast to president johnson who passed the civil rights act _meta_end_dot_

 in this ugly metaphor obama was mlk and hillary lbj _meta_end_dot_

 out stumping for his wife bill launched a tirade about the media s failure to do its job _meta_end_dot_

 he ranted about how obama had waffled as much as his wife on the issue of iraq and how his campaign had sleazily attacked both hillary and bill _meta_end_dot_

 according to the former president obama s holier than thou stance on iraq was the biggest fairy tale he had ever seen _meta_end_dot_

 hillary picked up on this theme as well saying the media had given obama a free pass it would be tempting to write this off as just another politician blaming the press but the antagonism goes deeper _meta_end_dot_

 in the course of their complaints the clinton s revealed the real source of their emotions _meta_end_dot_

 at the same event where he lashed out at the fairy tale bill got to the heart of his anger ken starr spent _meta_dollor_ref_ million to find out that i wouldn t take a nickel to see the cow jump over the moon hillary herself echoed this mantra when she described herself as the most vetted the most investigated and my goodness the most innocent of all the candidates _meta_end_dot_

 put aside the laughable nature of these assertions _meta_end_dot_

 in the clinton worldview it was the forces of hate with an assist from the media which destroyed the promise of bill s presidency _meta_end_dot_

 the personal foibles that grew out of bill s giving nature and his need to help others themselves the result of a troubled childhood were cynically used as a political weapon to defeat his progressive agenda _meta_end_dot_

 the _meta_number_ref_ campaign in this view is d j vu all over again _meta_end_dot_

 you see it can t possibly be their fault _meta_end_dot_

 when campaign surrogates bring up obama s drug use hillary knew nothing about it _meta_end_dot_

 when they discus obama s muslim background they meant it as a compliment _meta_end_dot_

 when they use potentially racist terms like shuck and jive to describe his campaign it is just a poor choice of words _meta_end_dot_

 when hillary herself says that obama hasn t done the spade work necessary to be president there are clearly no racist connotations intended _meta_end_dot_

 when her campaign lurches from awkward slogan to awkward slogan when she fails to answer a straightforward question when she gets in it to win and promptly places third when bill steps all over her message this is all someone else s fault the media being the prime culprit _meta_end_dot_

 the surprise win in new hampshire temporarily put a smile back on bill and hillary s faces and put aside the media attacks _meta_end_dot_

 remarkably after thirty five years of being an agent of change hillary claimed to have finally found her voice _meta_end_dot_

 call me cynical but hillary doesn t have a voice she has a driving ambition to be president and an inability to tolerate anyone who stands in her way _meta_end_dot_

 it doesn t take a pollster to predict this penchant for blaming others will return the moment she starts losing again _meta_end_dot_

 after all it can t be her fault _meta_end_dot_
