  a friend sends along this tidbit _meta_end_dot_

 the august new york times is once again presenting a labor union press release as a news story _meta_end_dot_

 the times piece is bylined michael j _meta_end_dot_

 de la merced whom i don t know but from his archive seems like a fairly conventional msm business reporter _meta_end_dot_

 it appears that the service employees international union is going on the warpath against the global private equity industry _meta_end_dot_

 but i have to admit i m flummoxed by what this story is trying to say _meta_end_dot_

 as i said the core of it is a press release disguised as news about a set of coordinated global protests to take place in _meta_number_ref_ cities in _meta_number_ref_ countries next month _meta_end_dot_

 no i m not kidding they really mean this _meta_end_exclamation_

 of course the seiu can t organize sic such an undertaking on its own so they re partnering with two outfits with a lot of experience in the coordinated protest business amnesty international and moveon org _meta_end_dot_

 keep reading i really don t know how to describe this more precisely than that _meta_end_dot_

 the seiu are obviously not out to unionize private equity shops lord knows _meta_end_dot_

 they d find out that in the successful firms even the secretaries are near millionaires and they re not really out to change the laws that affect pe _meta_end_dot_

 they say on one hand that the big pe firms have unfairly gamed the system more on that shortly but on the other they acknowledge that wholesale changes in the tax laws will have powerful and far reaching effects they haven t yet thought through _meta_end_dot_

 so the seiu admits they haven t endorsed any legislation at this time _meta_end_dot_

 what does one of the nation s largest and most corrupt labor unions want to do to private equity firms _meta_end_question_

 according to de la merced they are seeking to clamp down on the handsome profits that those companies reaped during the buyout boom oh dear _meta_end_dot_

 what is the seiu and its new york times mouthpiece really saying here _meta_end_question_

 well let s see _meta_end_dot_

 they note that some well known fatcats have made a few billion dollars while america s workers have trouble paying for their cars _meta_end_dot_

 when they say fatcats they single out david rubenstein of the carlyle group in washington dc and henry kravis of kohlberg kravis roberts in new york _meta_end_dot_

 odd that they should have left out household names like steven schwarzman of the blackstone group and a bunch of others i could rattle off what isn t the seiu and the times s newshound saying _meta_end_question_

 well let s see _meta_end_dot_

 what do private equity firms actually do _meta_end_question_

 there are plenty of variations but the basic idea in private equity is to acquire whole companies either in private transactions or from the public _meta_end_dot_

 you remember the leveraged buyout boom of the eighties _meta_end_question_

 same basic idea _meta_end_dot_

 many of the guys that pioneered that business like pete peterson tommy lee schwarzman and a few others are still at it today _meta_end_dot_

 why does a business go private _meta_end_question_

 again there are plenty of variations but they usually don t have a choice in the matter _meta_end_dot_

 pe firms often take over companies where the managers haven t been successful or have underperformed their peer companies _meta_end_dot_

 and where does the l in lbo come from _meta_end_question_

 usually a combination of balance sheet cash from the target company and debt financing from banks _meta_end_dot_

 up until the credit crisis got started nearly a year ago lbos were one of the hottest things around and global investors of all stripes were clamoring to put up money for them _meta_end_dot_

 nowadays almost no one is doing pe transactions _meta_end_dot_

 the big ones that were pending a year ago have mostly either failed had hung bridges or ended up in court as lenders like citigroup try to invoke force majeure clauses to pull out of their funding commitments _meta_end_dot_

 and the blackstone group which pulled off a sparkling ipo just as the credit mess caught fire has totally screwed the public investors that went into it _meta_end_dot_

 one of those was the government of china who thought their _meta_dollor_ref_ billion investment in blackstone was pretty smart _meta_end_dot_

 it was actually pretty stupid _meta_end_dot_

 bottom line no one is making much money on pe this year except for the management fees _meta_end_dot_

 so the seiu s timing is a little funky _meta_end_dot_

 but let s leave that to the side _meta_end_dot_

 what usually happens when a business particularly a publicly owned one goes private _meta_end_question_

 well the whole basis on which the business is managed changes _meta_end_dot_

 you go from whatever it is that public companies manage to usually avoiding sharp swings in earnings and revenues from quarter to quarter and you start concentrating on the bottom line _meta_end_dot_

 why _meta_end_question_

 simple _meta_end_dot_

 if the pe firm borrows billions of dollars to acquire the company in the first place they need to pay that money back with interest usually over a five to seven year horizon and they need to clear perhaps a _meta_percent_ref_ profit in that time as well _meta_end_dot_

 so they start cutting costs like crazy _meta_end_dot_

 ah yes i see it now _meta_end_exclamation_

 the seiu doesn t like it when companies cut costs _meta_end_dot_

 that means workers are called upon to do more with less or to take pay cuts or even to lose their jobs altogether _meta_end_exclamation_

 and perhaps the biggest single thing that makes workers inefficient is belonging to a labor union _meta_end_dot_

 i m going to leave the story here for now _meta_end_dot_

 when i get a chance later on i ll update you on one of the more interesting points that the seiu has made the charge that pe firms deliberately take advantage of tax laws which privilege debt finance at the expense of equity _meta_end_dot_

 here again they re way off base but the story is actually interesting and it will take a bit more explaining _meta_end_dot_
