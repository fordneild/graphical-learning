  update the plot thickens as the indispensible grace marie turner reminds us the program mrs _meta_end_dot_

 clinton is currently touting as her solution to the problems in america s health care system particularly its high number of uninsured citizens is officially called the american health choices plan though it is less than affectionately referred to by some as hillarycare ii in reference to her failed attempt to push a government health care system on the nation during the first years of her husband s presidency _meta_end_dot_

 under this program the government alone with no input from the free market is responsible for the regulation and management of health care _meta_end_dot_

 oxymoronically the plan whose formal title includes the term choice is built around what is known as an individual mandate a government requirement that all americans regardless of income or choice possess at least a government established minimal level of health insurance _meta_end_dot_

 read on _meta_end_dot_

 the inclusion of this individual mandate means of course that should this plan go into effect choice at its most basic level the choice whether or not to have a certain level of coverage or to have coverage at all would be eradicated _meta_end_dot_

 further though there would still be americans who cannot afford health coverage the mandate would apply to them as well causing them to be in violation of federal law simply because they cannot afford to comply _meta_end_dot_

 this situation would be exacerbated by the fact that with every single individual in our nation of the _meta_number_ref_ million being required to purchase coverage demand will become an inelastic element in the economic equation that determines the pricing of health insurance _meta_end_dot_

 in other words prices would continue to rise in response to a new law requiring every person in the nation to purchase insurance regardless of that service s price _meta_end_dot_

 mrs _meta_end_dot_

 clinton s opponent in the democratic presidential primary asked about this at a debate saying you can mandate that every american must have health insurance but there will still be people who can t afford it _meta_end_dot_

 and if they can t afford it what are you going to fine them _meta_end_question_

 are you going to garnish their wages the question was answered soon after as mrs _meta_end_dot_

 clinton told george stephanopoulos on abc s sunday morning show that her enforcement mechanism could indeed include going after people s wages mrs _meta_end_dot_

 clinton s admission that she does indeed intend to force every american to have a government decreed minimum level of health coverage and that she intends to enforce this by using the power of government to go after working americans income belies the choice based title of her proposed program _meta_end_dot_

 if government mandates that every american purchase something and uses its power of taxation and wage garnishment to enforce this then the resulting system may well be closer to being universal than any past program but any semblance of that program s having a voluntary nature or allowing choice has gone right out the window _meta_end_dot_

 this inability to reconcile the opposing natures of universality and choice or voluntary participation is unfortunately not a new problem for mrs _meta_end_dot_

 clinton _meta_end_dot_

 in _meta_number_ref_ she gave a speech which was later reprinted as an op ed in several newspapers based on martin luther king s famous i have a dream oration _meta_end_dot_

 in this speech she envisioned america s future after her fictional presidency _meta_end_dot_

 among other musings mrs _meta_end_dot_

 clinton said that a look at our country after her terms would show that our universal voluntary national service program includes civil defense workers who supplement our brave first responders and share the burden of vigilance at home at the time she shed no light on just how she planned to accomplish the feat of making her national service program both universal and voluntary _meta_end_dot_

 this would of course be quite an accomplishment as obviously a universal program includes all and is thus not voluntary and a voluntary program will always be far short of universal _meta_end_dot_

 likewise with her universal health care choice plan _meta_end_dot_

 the fact that mrs _meta_end_dot_

 clinton currently intends to build her health care plan through forced enrollment to the point of forcibly taking earned income from american workers to pay for it while still invoking the theme of consumer choice shows that she has still not learned that universal and voluntary are mutually exclusive attributes _meta_end_dot_

 in reality mrs _meta_end_dot_

 clinton s individual mandate is a call for government to use its power to force people to accept and enroll in a program they may not want or be able to afford _meta_end_dot_

 when the fact that the ranks of our uninsured are filled primarily with people who lack health coverage for precisely one of these two reasons is taken into account this proposal is shown for the undesirable overreach of government responsibility that it is _meta_end_dot_

 rather than continuing down this path of bigger and more intrusive government that regulates and interferes in people s lives and wallets mrs _meta_end_dot_

 clinton should spend a few minutes studying the free market and learning how things like choice and volunteerism really work _meta_end_dot_

 if she is interested we can point her in the right direction to get started _meta_end_dot_
