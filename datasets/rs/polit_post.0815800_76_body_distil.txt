 by which i mean that she explicitly drops out of the race explicitly endorses senator barack obama by name for president formally and explicitly releases her delegates to vote for senator barack obama and promises to give senator barack obama all the help that she can explicitly including her contribution lists and whatever general election money that she can legally transfer _meta_end_dot_
