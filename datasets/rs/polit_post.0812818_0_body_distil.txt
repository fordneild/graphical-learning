  i ll wait _meta_end_dot_

 pause all right _meta_end_question_

 ok explain something to me _meta_end_dot_

 obama s the inevitable nominee yes yes the gop is doomed yadda yadda the democrats are going to take the white house consolidate congress cut and run from iraq start war crimes trials against the bush administration etcetera etcetera etcetera _meta_end_dot_

 oh yes by now we over here on the right can sing along you folks haven t been shy about blaring these and one other discordant tunes in our weary weary ears _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ might have been a lowered expectations disaster for your crowd but with the new wave of red to blue or whatever you re calling it we should be on the brink of the glorious people s progressive future _meta_end_dot_

 why we re even hearing about how nancy pelosi is going to stand up to the administration with the new war supplemental bill h t hot air _meta_end_dot_

 all in all this is supposed to be your time _meta_end_dot_

 so why are you letting the democratic leadership set you up _meta_end_question_

 read on _meta_end_dot_

 this politico article war funding would break dem promises also h t hot air is kind of fun in its implications let me translate that for you speaker pelosi s contempt for her base couldn t be any more obvious if you painted it with red and white stripes _meta_end_dot_

 she knows that the netroots stopped caring about open government once it stopped being a campaign promise and started being an actual policy and she knows because they ve proved it to her time and time again that progressives generate considerably more light than heat when it comes to ending the gwot in iraq _meta_end_dot_

 hence the split the members of congress who are pretending to be most outraged over the issue will be able to pretend to vote their consciences it ll get tossed and all that will be left is the lovely lovely pork which will hopefully get vetoed by the president letting the democrats go through the motions of trying to make political hay from it _meta_end_dot_

 speaking as a neoconservative i am going to freely admit that i don t really care overmuch about whatever kabuki theater needs to take place in order to fund both the troops and their presence in iraq _meta_end_dot_

 but for the life of me i can t understand why this doesn t grate on progressive souls _meta_end_dot_

 this mechanism is how they are going to continue funding the war they are not being particularly quiet about how they are going to continue funding the war and there s no indication that they are going to even be slowed down in continuing to fund the war _meta_end_dot_

 which leads to two questions and _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 if i hit them hard in the nose hard enough with a rolled up newspaper will they whimper and show me their belly too _meta_end_question_

 moe ps forgot one other question _meta_end_dot_

 still ask questions like this a year plus into a democratic congress _meta_end_question_

 addendum by erick just to be clear netrooties when your favorite member of congress votes on the rule to approve nancy s plan they are voting for this way to save face with you while betraying you _meta_end_dot_

 they figure you are too dumb to notice _meta_end_dot_

 of course so do we which is why we wanted to point it out and rub your noses in it _meta_end_dot_
