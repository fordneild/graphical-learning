  as his nbc colleagues have been reporting tim russert was everyman _meta_end_dot_

 the rumpled and cheap looking suits the unremarkable ties unremarkably tied around the collar the non matinee idol hair and the obesity that led to his untimely demise could easily cause people to fail to take him seriously _meta_end_dot_

 too often despite all warnings to the contrary we still tend to judge books by their cover and to judge people by their physical appearances _meta_end_dot_

 many people looked at tim russert assumed certain things about his abilities from his looks especially when they compared his visage to the visages of other television news personalities and decided that when it came to abilities russert occupied the middle of the bell curve _meta_end_dot_

 those people would be in for nasty surprises when they realized that they were being questioned on sunday mornings by a man in possession of a powerful intellect a man who used that intellect diligently and prodigiously backed up with a fearsome work ethic to learn all he possibly could about his guests and their positions in order to take the other side when he asked them questions precisely what meet the press legend lawrence spivak trained and advised him to do when russert took over the show _meta_end_dot_

 in addition to being the moderator of meet the press russert was the washington bureau chief for nbc news a kind of player coach the likes of which are no longer seen in journalism _meta_end_dot_

 he was a class act _meta_end_dot_

 he was a tough and demanding interrogator but one who always wanted his guests to come up with answers instead of being left stammering and flummoxed _meta_end_dot_

 and he conducted his interrogations with good cheer and great enthusiasm _meta_end_dot_

 he conducted them with kindness as well given the manner of his death i can t help but remember that in his interviews of vice president cheney he would always close by asking the vice president about his health _meta_end_dot_

 to be sure the health of the vice president was and is a newsworthy event _meta_end_dot_

 but given the stories of tim russert s many kindnesses to others i cannot believe that he didn t ask those questions out of genuine care and concern for a fellow human being _meta_end_dot_

 russert never saw others in the great game of politics as adversaries or enemies _meta_end_dot_

 he didn t hector like chris matthews does and he didn t pompously pontificate the way keith olbermann does _meta_end_dot_

 he informed _meta_end_dot_

 and he was always civil and good natured about it leading people to respect his opinions and to admire his style _meta_end_dot_

 now that he is gone the colleagues that he left behind can pay tribute to his memory by adopting the very exemplary professional and personal characteristics that so defined tim russert s life _meta_end_dot_

 he was blessed amongst men _meta_end_dot_

 as david gregory pointed out in nbc s coverage of russert s death and life judaism teaches us that when the departed meets god and his angels he or she is asked two things _meta_end_dot_

 did the departed try to have a family and did he or she work for the redemption of the world _meta_end_question_

 it is indisputable that for tim russert both questions could be answered in the affirmative _meta_end_dot_

 he took joy in his work and in his family _meta_end_dot_

 he got to make a vocation out of his avocation and he was constantly surrounded by the love of his wife his son his father and his sisters and their families _meta_end_dot_

 you can t ask for anything more _meta_end_dot_

 tim russert was taken from us far too early _meta_end_dot_

 sundays will never be the same and during the course of this political season a whole treasure trove of insights and analysis will be missed by lesser journalists and pundits or will be discovered by the public eye far too late simply because tim russert is no longer around to offer them _meta_end_dot_

 he was taken from us far too early _meta_end_dot_

 but while we wish that his life could have been longer we rejoice in the fact that it was so filled and so fulfilling _meta_end_dot_

 rest in peace _meta_end_dot_
