  so with the resignation of fidel castro from the presidency it was conventional wisdom that the ascension of raul castro would signal some form of political change and liberalization in cuba _meta_end_dot_

 so much for that _meta_end_dot_

 not only does raul castro announce that there will be no change whatsoever in policy he picks an old hard line figure for the number two spot just to stick it to those who hoped for a greater amount of political freedom in cuba _meta_end_dot_

 plus a change plus c est la m me chose _meta_end_dot_

 but let s look at the upside at least chris bertram will be happy _meta_end_dot_

 to be sure bertram may want to read this to find out just how well or how badly depending on one s sensibilities the revolution is going _meta_number_ref_ miles south of the floridian coast _meta_end_dot_

 and he might want to read this as well there is a lot more like that just waiting to disillusion the likes of chris bertram assuming that he bothers to read writings chock full of uncomfortable facts _meta_end_dot_
