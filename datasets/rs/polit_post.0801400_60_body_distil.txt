  i will put this in the diaries _meta_end_dot_

 if one of the contributors wishes to front it i have no objection _meta_end_dot_

 he must not be a recent convert or he may become conceited and fall under the same judgment as the devil _meta_number_ref_ tim _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ niv the wealth of the rich is their fortified city they imagine it an unscalable wall prov _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ niv these are the two verses i ve dwelled on for a while contemplating the romney campaign _meta_end_dot_

 i ve given a few people the impression that i dislike mitt romney _meta_end_dot_

 that could not be further from the truth _meta_end_dot_

 but given repeated concerns i figured i should tell you exactly how i feel _meta_end_dot_

 in short any position you can think of today held by mitt romney probably has a related sound bite of mitt romney saying exactly the opposite within the past five years _meta_end_dot_

 i am willing to suspend belief and believe that mitt romney s conversion to conservatism was sincere and not politically expedient _meta_end_dot_

 he did after all run as a republican in massachusetts and he won of course it was as a pro abortion pro gay rights anti bush tax cut indifferent to reagan new england republican _meta_end_dot_

 nonetheless i have a hard time seeing why we should hand the reins over to a new convert to conservatism _meta_end_dot_

 he has not yet had time in the wilderness through good and bad to make sure he has necessary fidelity to our core beliefs _meta_end_dot_

 i have deep concerns that when it becomes politically expedient for him to do so he will sell us all down the river _meta_end_dot_

 as paul warned timothy new converts tend to think it is about them not the message _meta_end_dot_

 they grow prideful and arrogant _meta_end_dot_

 they get sloppy _meta_end_dot_

 they forget or suppress the principles _meta_end_dot_

 you may take issue with that but in looking at mitt romney s record as governor of massachusetts i have seen no more than a handful of examples of him fighting the good fight on principle knowing he was going to lose _meta_end_dot_

 and if you don t believe me i would point out again that he did not exercise his veto of the _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ abortions _meta_end_dot_

 short of saul of tarsus due to his unique conversion i believe we should put no new convert in charge of any movement be it religious ideological or political until the convert has had time to prove he really believes the tenets _meta_end_dot_

 in two debates already mitt romney has used tokens of class warfare that should make any conservative wince once about tax cuts for the rich and once about social security benefit cuts for the rich to help the poor _meta_end_dot_

 my other deep concern about mitt romney is not about him but about his campaign _meta_end_dot_

 his campaign has largely operated on the idea that through their money they could wage war against anyone in the primary and anyone in the general election _meta_end_dot_

 that hasn t worked out so well for him _meta_end_dot_

 the arrogance of fortune in that campaign gave way to a sense of invulnerability _meta_end_dot_

 that sense led to the achilles heel of the campaign they could buy up all the air time but they could not sell their candidate to the voters _meta_end_dot_

 he has a hard time connecting with the average person _meta_end_dot_

 i have no doubt that mike huckabee s line about people wanting to vote for the person they work with not the person who laid them off was directed at mitt romney huckabee s denials notwithstanding _meta_end_dot_

 this fortress of wealth has made the romney campaign one of the most predictable campaigns of all time _meta_end_dot_

 every move seems choreographed through abundant polling and implemented with abundant cash _meta_end_dot_

 that captures the overwhelming point here _meta_end_dot_

 all of mitt s money and all of mitt s men have not yet been able to connect him to the voters at large but they ve spent a hell of a lot of money trying i suspect they ll succeed in michigan _meta_end_dot_

 finally i will not belabor this point but ben domenech successfully mocked my last concern _meta_end_dot_

 this has absolutely nothing to do with mitt romney himself but it goes to the core of his campaign _meta_end_dot_

 some vocal supporters and sycophants of the romney campaign have deluded themselves into thinking that if a voter does not like mitt romney he must be anti mormon bigots _meta_end_dot_

 it is unfortunate but it has happened _meta_end_dot_

 certainly some people will not support mitt romney because they are anti mormon bigots _meta_end_dot_

 but the vast majority of people do not support him because _meta_number_ref_ they do not trust him or _meta_number_ref_ they trust someone else more _meta_end_dot_

 it is unfortunate that in a republican campaign we have stooped to liberal attack canards e g _meta_end_dot_

 if you don t like affirmative action you must be a racist or if you don t like mitt romney you must be a bigot _meta_end_dot_

 you feel free to disagree with me on these points _meta_end_dot_

 i don t care _meta_end_dot_

 many of you have asked about how i view the romney campaign _meta_end_dot_

 well now you know and may wish you didn t _meta_end_dot_
