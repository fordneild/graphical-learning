  to quote a somewhat heterodox republican the beat goes on that is plant gate marches on _meta_end_dot_

 the nation that bastion of right wing journalism is working on more examples of planted questions _meta_end_dot_

 but hillary s dishonesty and artifice is only one part of the story _meta_end_dot_

 there s also hypocrisy _meta_end_dot_

 you see just last month she attacked someone at a town hall for asking a question that she alleged was planted _meta_end_dot_

 don t believe me _meta_end_question_

 watch read on for nbc s take on this _meta_end_dot_

 nbc described it as clinton gets snippy with iowan over iran so it is ok for her to plant questions but not her opponents _meta_end_question_

 imagine what she would do if she were actually _meta_end_dot_

 president _meta_end_dot_
