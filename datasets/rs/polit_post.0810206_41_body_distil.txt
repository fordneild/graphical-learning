  the house voted to effectively kill the pending u s colombia free trade deal today _meta_end_dot_

 this was expected but no less appalling _meta_end_dot_

 as mentioned before speaker nancy pelosi was the prime mover behind the killing of the deal _meta_end_dot_

 and she did so at the behest of unions _meta_end_dot_

 one trusts that those unions know they are responsible for the opportunity cost in prosperity terms when it comes to their own members _meta_end_dot_

 meanwhile dan drezner goes through the reasons why the trade deal was a good idea _meta_end_dot_

 one quibble contra the good professor nafta has been quite beneficial for the american economy _meta_end_dot_

 and in response to kevin drum s point concerning agricultural subsidies and the need to decry them he is quite right _meta_end_dot_

 but even if free traders fail to make this point that doesn t mean that free trade ought to be held hostage _meta_end_dot_

 my doctor can tell me that i need to lower my bad cholesterol by changing my diet _meta_end_dot_

 i will listen to that advice even if my doctor fails to mention the need for me to get as much exercise as possible in addition to changing my diet _meta_end_dot_
