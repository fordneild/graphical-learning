  the question being will the media ask senators obama and clinton about berkeley s insult to the united states marine corps the answer almost certainly will be no background info here update they probably won t ask if either senator supports senator demint s proposal either update and more here _meta_end_dot_

 quite the collection of petulant man children these obamaniacs are turning out to be huh update and in the credit where it s due category both have already indicated that they ll be enforcing the solomon amendment _meta_end_dot_

 so they ve got no reason not to condemn this outrageous attack on our military yes this is more of an indictment of the media than it is of the senators in question who would probably respond that they aren t in the habit of volunteering to throw rocks at hornet nests _meta_end_dot_

 still it s a pity that senator clinton won t address this particular insult she has less of an excuse than senator obama who after all just scored an endorsement from a group whose hardcore members default to hating marines _meta_end_dot_

 those wishing to dispute that point are welcome to provide me with a formal statement by moveon org forcefully condemning the actions of code pink against the marine recruiting office in berkeley ca _meta_end_dot_

 i will put that statement on the front page _meta_end_dot_

 i will gleefully put that statement on the front page with as many eye catching html bells and whistles that i can figure out _meta_end_dot_

 i will even alert about ten or so of the other top right wing bloggers who will probably also just as gleefully put that statement on their front pages as well _meta_end_dot_

 you may wish to contemplate the implications of that _meta_end_dot_
