  update moe _meta_percent_ref_ no change _meta_number_ref_k difference _meta_end_dot_

 but the urban areas are starting to come in _meta_end_dot_

 update moe at _meta_percent_ref_ clinton obama _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_k difference _meta_end_dot_

 obama strongholds apparently still not counted in total _meta_end_dot_

 update moe and at _meta_percent_ref_ in it s obama clinton _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ with less than _meta_number_ref_k difference _meta_end_dot_

 it looks like presumed obama strongholds have yet to be fully tabulated and besides everybody s too busy getting their lawyers on line _meta_end_dot_

 update moe ok with _meta_percent_ref_ in it s obama clinton _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ with a _meta_number_ref_k vote difference _meta_end_dot_

 that difference has been trending in clinton s favor for the last few points but that could easily be signal noise _meta_end_dot_

 on the other hand when i started the update it was _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ and _meta_number_ref_k _meta_end_dot_

 on the gripping hand it ll all be settled in court anyway _meta_end_dot_

 update by neil the clinton campaign is alleging fraud in the texas caucuses and oddly enough obama s chief counsel called into clinton s emergency conference call with reporters essentially to accuse them of whining because they lost _meta_end_dot_

 rooting for injuries _meta_end_dot_

 update _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ pm by adam c cnn calls tx for mccain and the republican nomination for president of the united states for mccain _meta_end_dot_

 congratulations senator mccain you are officially the standard bearer of the republican party _meta_end_dot_

 update by jeff yes the early results are published returns from early voting which lasted from the _meta_number_ref_th through the _meta_number_ref_th of february _meta_end_dot_

 update yeah sorry about the formatting _meta_end_dot_

 also if you re wondering why we re getting results in tx when the polls aren t actually closed yet the consensus seems to be early voting results _meta_end_dot_

 this is not turning out to be the smoothest election night on record _meta_end_dot_

 moe lane results here or here for the gop here for the democrats _meta_end_dot_

 my predictions _meta_end_question_

 shoot at this point everybody s guessing and the baby s making a weird sound _meta_end_dot_

 flip a coin _meta_end_dot_
