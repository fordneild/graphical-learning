 bobby jindal has made comprehensive ethics reform agenda item _meta_number_ref_ of his administration _meta_end_dot_

 a special legislative session convenes today that will consider only ethics reform issues _meta_end_dot_

 judging from their agenda it uh looks like they have their work cut out for them _meta_end_dot_

 the one item here that has received some pushback in the press is including the judiciary in the scope of the reforms _meta_end_dot_

 the judiciary has its own ethics structure and the concerns raised are on a constitutional separation of powers basis _meta_end_dot_

 entire agenda below the fold _meta_end_dot_

 emphasis added
