  reading the david brooks piece that pejman linked nearby i thought to ask what would happen if i were to go negative in my own campaigns _meta_end_dot_

 i m frequently involved in selling high ticket technology products to large corporations _meta_end_dot_

 if anything could benefit from a more civilized approach to sales a new politics if you will you d think that would be it _meta_end_dot_

 read on _meta_end_dot_

 david brooks says that obama won t be able to go negative against hillary clinton because he rightly perceived that people are tired of that mode of selling _meta_end_dot_

 so he constructed an entire political persona on being a nice guy and that s the essence of his appeal to be made president of the united states _meta_end_dot_

 to go the other way now would eliminate the basis of his candidacy _meta_end_dot_

 to be fair you can easily see where he d get the idea that this could be a winning strategy _meta_end_dot_

 most of the people on his side of the political aisle will tell you with a straight face that acting aggressively to protect our national security is a bad idea because no one likes us anymore mrs _meta_end_dot_

 clinton for her part well understands the value of power _meta_end_dot_

 in the pursuit of power her ability to shift gears as the need arises is nothing short of protean _meta_end_dot_

 she ll go from soft and cuddly to weepy to the woman who would presumably push the nuclear button at _meta_number_ref_ am all in the blink of an eyelash _meta_end_dot_

 such shape shifting is easy when all of your shapes are substance free chimeras _meta_end_dot_

 this takes me back to my thought exercise _meta_end_dot_

 in selling expensive products to people who know what they re buying you simply can t fling around a lot of well bovine excreta _meta_end_dot_

 people know exactly what you re trying to say before you say it _meta_end_dot_

 and it matters enough for their self importance that they ll call you on it every time _meta_end_dot_

 and they don t censor their language either _meta_end_dot_

 later they ll swap vendor smackdown stories with their colleagues over beers _meta_end_dot_

 in truth there are vendors who approach sales as a blood sport _meta_end_dot_

 these tactics do work but only if you already hold a commanding market position _meta_end_dot_

 and people hate and resent you for it even as they cut checks to you so the kind of mudslinging that political campaigns engage in which would straightforwardly be libel and slander were it not targeted at public figures backfires every time in a high powered sales situation _meta_end_dot_

 and obama seems to have found a lode of voters who feel the same way _meta_end_dot_

 perhaps the kind of voters who respond to mudslinging are the same people who allow car salesmen and mortgage brokers to browbeat and shame them _meta_end_dot_

 to be sure obama voters also respond to messianic charisma which also tends to work in enterprise sales but only to get you in the door not to close the deal _meta_end_dot_

 and in any case this says more about obama s voters than it does about him him so if you can t go negative in the sense of flinging groundless accusations that wouldn t be out of place on a grade school playgound what do you do instead _meta_end_question_

 in enterprise sales you have to take an intelligent approach to the customer s problem and show her why your product addresses it more effectively than your competition s product _meta_end_dot_

 you have to prove that doing business with you and your company is not risky and you have to demonstrate unequivocally that you can and will follow through on your promises _meta_end_dot_

 and of course you have to make this case to her over lunch in the kind of restaurant she can t afford on her corporate vice president s salary in short you have to have substance _meta_end_dot_

 that s the box obama is in _meta_end_dot_

 he can t go negative on clinton because his whole campaign is based on rejecting that kind of selling _meta_end_dot_

 but he ll have a hard time closing the deal because he has nothing to sell in the first place _meta_end_dot_
