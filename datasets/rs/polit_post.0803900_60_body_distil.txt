  all data from here and they re upfront about the numbers being speculative right now _meta_end_dot_

 anybody who is trying to give you definitive numbers is lying to you robin laws wasn t kidding when he compared the current primary system to a rpg that wouldn t make it past playtest _meta_end_dot_

 i ll also note that this is all basic let the calculator round it off math calculations anyway _meta_end_dot_

 scenario _meta_number_ref_ fl mi not included in final total scenario _meta_number_ref_ fl mi included conclusions clinton can lose every race from here on in and still win on the first ballot through a combination of _meta_number_ref_ to _meta_number_ref_ splits or _meta_number_ref_ to _meta_number_ref_ splits if they seat mi and fl in obama s favor in the delegate vote and enough super delegates to handle the gap _meta_end_dot_

 an effective _meta_percent_ref_ tie in delegates means that she does not have to force the dnc to seat the two state delegations because she will win without them _meta_end_dot_

 winning strategy sticking it out playing retail and keeping obama below _meta_number_ref_ to _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 obama can win every race from here on in and still lose on the first ballot _meta_end_dot_

 to ensure victory he needs to aim for a consistent _meta_number_ref_ to _meta_number_ref_ and get _meta_number_ref_ to _meta_number_ref_ delegate acquisition in each primary and caucus from here on out _meta_end_dot_

 he cannot allow the florida and michigan delegates to be seated in their current configuration without that margin _meta_end_dot_

 every race he outright loses hurts him disproportionately _meta_end_dot_

 winning strategy shock and awe _meta_end_dot_

 he can outspend her but his burn rate will have to go through the roof starting _meta_end_dot_

 right about now because he has less margin than she does and it decreases every time he loses _meta_end_dot_

 for both puerto rico has _meta_number_ref_ delegates up for grabs and it s winner take all by district _meta_end_dot_

 that may represent a last hope by june _meta_end_dot_

 moe ps don t count on the super delegates abandoning ship en masse in either direction _meta_end_dot_

 they ll do that after it s clear that one side is going to lose not before _meta_end_dot_

 and clear is the one thing that this campaign season is distinctly lacking _meta_end_dot_
