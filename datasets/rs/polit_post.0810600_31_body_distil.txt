  what an imbecile harry reid took to the floor of the senate today to waste everyone s time by informing the senate that visitors to the capitol smell bad _meta_end_dot_

 folks you ever get the sense that democrats don t just hate you but they actually hate people _meta_end_question_

 they sequester themselves off on billionaires row away from the little people _meta_end_dot_

 they go to the senate floor using their private elevators and their private subway system so they don t have to mingle with the little people _meta_end_dot_

 and then when they describe the average american they claim to want to help the democrats refer to them as bitter gun toting jesus freaks who smell bad _meta_end_dot_

 perhaps maybe they spend so much time hanging out with the french looking john kerry who gets nothing done that they ve confused his breed for the regular american _meta_end_dot_
