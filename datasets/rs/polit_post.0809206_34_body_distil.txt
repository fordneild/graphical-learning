  as we all now know today fox news reprinted a london times article which said that the _meta_number_ref_ year mystery of the cuneiform planisphere tablet had been solved and that the _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ year old inscription had been found to be a transcription of a _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ year old eyewitness account of an asteroid that scorched mesopotamia on its way to the austrian alps where it impacted in what is now k fels _meta_end_dot_

 the article titled researchers asteroid destroyed sodom and gomorrah caused the hackles of some thinking christians to be raised with valid albeit in my opinion misdirected reason _meta_end_dot_

 read on _meta_end_dot_

 speaking as an archaeologist and someone who has an unfinished degree in astrophysics the information contained in the story here while clearly written by an author with little or no understanding of myth history religion archaeology and the nexus of the four amounts to a plausible interpretation of the available data _meta_end_dot_

 i would like to read dr _meta_end_dot_

 hempsell hemps a ll s text to find out exactly what new information he had and how he developed his conclusions however again based on the information presented in the article the headline is indeed completely plausible _meta_end_dot_

 consider while this archaeological and astrohistorical explanation may seem to be a slap at christians and an attempt to replace the religious explanations of the bible with archaeological refutations it is in fact nothing of the sort _meta_end_dot_

 the fact that so many biblical accounts of events from battles to migrations to the destruction of cities have been backed up by the archaeological and astrohistorical record serves to bolster the bible s case as a work of far more than fantasy spotty oral tradition and religious mumbo jumbo _meta_end_dot_

 instead as more of its described events turn out to have their feet planted firmly in reality and in the historical record its credibility is exponentially increased _meta_end_dot_

 the determination again i have to read the book in question before i comment any more authoritatively on its thesis that the wake of the asteroid that met its end with the k fels impact event was the dealer of death and destruction that was responsible for the demolition of the cities of sodom and gomorrah makes perfect sense based on the information presented in the article _meta_end_dot_

 in fact i see far more information in the entry that would back this up than i do information that would suggest that this is a reach a ratings ploy or an attempt to equate an eyewitness account from the time of biblical civilization with the mu upsilon theta omicron that developed around such an event in the intervening millennia between its occurrence and the rise of these comparatively much later civilizations _meta_end_dot_

 the implements which god uses to do his work are fascinating and a study of these natural events through the lens of the supernatural is what the field of comparative mu upsilon theta omicron and religion both historical and present is largely based in not to confuse the practice of religion which is based around a communion or relationship with a deity _meta_end_dot_

 the idea that god used such natural tools as an asteroid or an earthquake or a flood sound familiar to do his bidding takes nothing away from god s inspiration and causing of that event rather the fact that such natural forces were used a results in the same effect and b puts those events into the provable and discoverable historical record _meta_end_dot_

 what genius that is to do supernatural work using natural tools so as to leave a bread crumb trail behind that can be discovered debated and learned from by man and that can help show to those who look for it that the written record of christianity contains far more fact than fiction _meta_end_dot_
