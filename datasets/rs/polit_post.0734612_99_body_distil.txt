  nancy pelosi seems hell bent on reliving charlie gordon and his buddy algernon s lives as detailed in the famous flowers for algernon novel novella _meta_end_dot_

 after all in the original piece algernon was a dumb mouse turned genius turned dumb mouse _meta_end_dot_

 of course in algernon s case it was chemically induced they don t test for these things in congress critters so we ll never actually know if ole nance had help along the way to her miserably failed position as speaker of the house but boy howdy has she returned to her original dumb status all the same _meta_end_dot_

 i m reminded of an old song that pays some degree of homage to the original story ya know if you replace the word operation with election we might be on to something here _meta_end_dot_

 more below the fold _meta_end_dot_

 really nance _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ for flowers _meta_end_question_

 come on now _meta_end_dot_

 i realize it s all for the children but _meta_number_ref_ grand could buy a used mini van full of _meta_number_ref_ s retreads to run off that sheehan woman that wants your job _meta_end_exclamation_

 it could have bought a few of those folks looking for jobs americans won t do to sneak into the rose garden and pick some for your distinguished guests too _meta_end_dot_

 from the hill the people s house my expletive deleted in deference to the posting guidelines _meta_end_dot_

 i ve never had _meta_number_ref_ ooo dollars worth of flowers in my house _meta_end_dot_

 i pick a handful from the yard and hope for the best as suggested by boehner s people when they said this that ladies and gentlemen is the line of the day right there _meta_end_dot_
