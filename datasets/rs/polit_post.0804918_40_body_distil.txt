  two pieces of good news _meta_number_ref_ phoenix arizona has repudiated its sanctuary city policy and is now authorizing the police to inquire into the immigration status on anyone arrested _meta_end_dot_

 moreover police chief jack f _meta_end_dot_

 harris who has been outspoken in warning of the dangers of major police involvement in immigration enforcement said he endorsed the policy would write regulations for it and put it into place within three months this latter fact is important because occasionally we hear arguments from immigration enthusiasts to the effect that the local police oppose measures to involve them in immigration enforcement _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ at least someone in europe has got some guts _meta_end_dot_

 and yes yes i know there have been long and tedious arraignments generally cobbled together with the ever expedient adhesive of guilt by association laid out against european politicians who oppose the islamization of europe _meta_end_dot_

 if only the same industry were evident in the press for investigating the history of prominent islamic spokesman _meta_end_dot_

 in my judgment the history of the jihad offers a certain banality in its malignity on this point _meta_end_dot_

 so wicked an institution and doctrine as this is bound to corrupt even those who oppose it _meta_end_dot_

 putting down the revolts of the moriscos in early modern spain was a crucial component to the expansion of the inquisition as an agency of the spainish monarchy _meta_end_dot_

 the intrigues of the byzantines were made more brutal and treacherous by the participation of the turks _meta_end_dot_

 once the jihad has a foothold in your country you will not escape its depredations without dirtying your hands _meta_end_dot_

 jihad sharia and dhimmia all three doctrines should be summarily proscribed from promulgation to promote any should be made legally tantamount to sedition _meta_end_dot_

 immigration from muslim nations should end virtually without exception _meta_end_dot_

 in sum we the people of the united states should make plain our republican judgment that until islamdom ceases churning out terrorists subversives and brigands we will so far as possible cease interaction with it _meta_end_dot_

 the alternative is the continued expansion of the security state the diminution of privacy and personal liberty and the corruption of our security agencies under constant strain not to mention gradual increase in jihadist aggression and agitation _meta_end_dot_
