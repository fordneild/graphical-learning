  we are informed that barack obama intends to be more wonky in his speechmaking _meta_end_dot_

 this is good to know _meta_end_dot_

 it would be even better if in addition to being wonky senator obama would bother to ensure that he is correct about the details of the issues he discusses _meta_end_dot_

 alas this is not the case when it comes to issues like trade _meta_end_dot_

 as the washington post points out both obama and hillary clinton have been decidedly unenlightened when it comes to the issue of free trade read on _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 greg mankiw gives us more depressing details on this uptick in economic neanderthalism _meta_end_dot_

 and the neanderthalism doesn t stop there _meta_end_dot_

 in recent comments obama blamed the economic downturn we are experiencing on income inequality this would come as a surprise to economists who actually have a grasp and command of the issues surrounding income inequality people like gary becker and kevin murphy who point out that what we call income inequality is in fact the natural consequence of an economy that is increasingly populated by people who have benefited from higher education _meta_end_dot_

 obama has ignored all of these details thus far and has instead run a substance free campaign on economic issues _meta_end_dot_

 his attempts to tie free trade and income inequality to every single bad economic development under the sun are free and devoid of any kind of a demonstration of a causal relationship between his favorite bugaboos and the economic bad news he decries _meta_end_dot_

 hillary clinton is of course no better _meta_end_dot_

 in all honesty it should be pointed out that there are plenty of people on the right who appear to have decided that championing free trade ain t all it s cracked up to be anymore _meta_end_dot_

 mike huckabee didn t start this brand of know nothingism but he certainly helped push it along _meta_end_dot_

 facts don t matter to any of those people on the left or on the populist right who have decided in a fevered moment of bad judgment that has alas lasted far too long to undermine one of the single most effective prosperity making ideas of all time _meta_end_dot_

 and yes i have heard all the arguments about how trade with communist china is a bad idea and hurts us _meta_end_dot_

 guess what those arguments are bogus _meta_end_dot_

 if you disagree with the arguments presented in the cato link do try to actually take on those arguments instead of screaming it s cato _meta_end_exclamation_

 i won t listen to them _meta_end_exclamation_

 lalalalalala_meta_beep_ref_ are you concerned about the quality of some of the products that are sent our way from china _meta_end_question_

 so am i but that is a food and products safety issue _meta_end_dot_

 it is not an excuse for protectionism _meta_end_dot_

 facts matter _meta_end_dot_

 and the facts are not on the protecionists side _meta_end_dot_

 end of story i am sorry if this state of affairs disappoints economic isolationists but life is full of such letdowns one of which is that there are so many economic isolationists to deal with and who seek to send the economy into the tank by advocating and trying to implement utterly boneheaded policies _meta_end_dot_

 i care deeply about poor people _meta_end_dot_

 that s why i want them to be rich and one of the absolute best ways to make them rich is through free trade _meta_end_dot_

 barack obama hillary clinton and the huckabeeans doubtless love poor people as well _meta_end_dot_

 that s why they endorse protectionism and mercantilism and seek to undermine free enterprise in general it ensures that there are a lot more poor people to love _meta_end_dot_
