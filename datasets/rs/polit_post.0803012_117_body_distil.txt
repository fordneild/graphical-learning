  i want my party back _meta_end_dot_

 i really do _meta_end_dot_

 my party if you will remember is the one that fights the democrats on spending instead of pushing them aside to get a place at the trough _meta_end_dot_

 my party is the one that is conservative without michael gerson _meta_end_dot_

 my party is the one where we can disagree politely on matters without calling each other traitor _meta_end_dot_

 now personally i blame george w _meta_end_dot_

 bush for all of this _meta_end_dot_

 you can blame romney or mccain or giulilani if you want _meta_end_dot_

 but george w _meta_end_dot_

 bush left us with a political power vacuum _meta_end_dot_

 he knew cheney wouldn t run _meta_end_dot_

 cheney would be the heir apparent _meta_end_dot_

 instead of pointing us in a direction we had this wonderful primary season that has split the party into pieces _meta_end_dot_

 the gop has a pattern of going with the heir apparent _meta_end_dot_

 the party is keeping true to form by heading toward mccain _meta_end_dot_

 it has nothing to do with rejecting conservatism _meta_end_dot_

 it has everything to do with conservatives following history and tradition and traditionally we ve always known who the heir was going to be _meta_end_dot_

 george w _meta_end_dot_

 bush in his utter disregard for the conservatism of the party decided to break with past precedent on this issue and we find ourselves in the present mess _meta_end_dot_

 along the way he also gave us big government conservatism michael gerson dan bartlett an immigration fight and out of control spending by his own party _meta_end_dot_

 so now we are left with romney and mccain _meta_end_dot_

 keep reading _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 frankly this goes to the free market which i m a big believer in _meta_end_dot_

 the reason we have such horrid options this year is because only once in the past fifty years or so has a candidate of the sitting president s party captured the white house after an eight year stint _meta_end_dot_

 that was bush s father succeeding reagan _meta_end_dot_

 the writing is on the wall that we are going to lose _meta_end_dot_

 so we re left with the tool from massachusetts and the nut from arizona _meta_end_dot_

 both are unpalatable because the only consistent thing about one is his hair and the only consistent thing about the other is his crazy _meta_end_dot_

 frankly though given the choice between the hair or the crazy i ll take the crazy _meta_end_dot_

 at least he has a shot at winning _meta_end_dot_

 but they both suck _meta_end_dot_

 and we deserve it _meta_end_dot_

 historically we deserve it because we ve had the white house for eight years _meta_end_dot_

 and we as conservatives also deserve it because we hitched our wagon to george bush and didn t really have our falling out with him until well after he d completely undermined what it is to be a conservative _meta_end_dot_

 the only one who has been saying loudly that george bush is not a conservative is rush limbaugh _meta_end_dot_

 can we finally admit he is yet again right _meta_end_question_

 so we need to rebuild our brand _meta_end_dot_

 romney is utterly incapable of doing it _meta_end_dot_

 he goes to michigan and runs to the left of mike huckabee _meta_end_dot_

 he goes to florida and beats up mccain over the one vote mccain did right voting against medicare part d _meta_end_dot_

 he has so far been able to win in only one of two states wherein he had a home state advantage one state with a high lds population and one state no one else paid any attention to _meta_end_dot_

 heck he outspent mccain _meta_number_ref_ to _meta_number_ref_ in florida and lost in a closed republican primary _meta_end_dot_

 the nut meanwhile has won in the south won in romney s other state with a home state advantage not that they like to admit that they viewed new hampshire that way any more and won florida the great melting pot state _meta_end_dot_

 you are full of it if you think romney is now somehow going to rally conservatives to win in arizona california delaware illinois minnesota new jersey or new york in less than a week _meta_end_dot_

 by the way as an aside hasn t anyone told romney that running as the mba president or the management president equals running as george w _meta_end_dot_

 bush and we re all ready to move beyond him _meta_end_question_

 as another aside has anyone pointed out to john mccain that in addition to losing young people in florida he continues to lose conservatives and if he thinks he can actually win in november without conservatives he s even crazier than i thought _meta_end_question_

 look we re probably going to lose in november _meta_end_dot_

 history is against us _meta_end_dot_

 if we do win it ll be because mccain is the nominee not romney _meta_end_dot_

 nobody really trusts either of them but independent voters trust mccain more _meta_end_dot_

 as for me _meta_end_question_

 well i voted for fred thompson _meta_end_dot_

 his campaign was a disaster but he was the conservative _meta_end_dot_

 i have no use for the rest of them _meta_end_dot_

 the good candidates all sat out because they recognize history is against us _meta_end_dot_

 we ll see them in four years with fred thompson s stellar policies and an actually competent campaign operation _meta_end_dot_

 but i shed no tears over john mccain as the nominee _meta_end_dot_

 i suspect he won t be nearly the electoral disaster that romney would be _meta_end_dot_

 and now let me add to this and i ll say this in another post _meta_end_dot_

 very soon we here at redstate rally for the nominee be it romney or mccain _meta_end_dot_

 we fight the democrats not because we like our guy but because we know that fundamentally regardless of who it is he will be better than who the other side offers _meta_end_dot_

 and if you disagree i d admonish you to sit back and let the rest of us fight the good fight _meta_end_dot_

 at some point soon we impose the do no harm principle _meta_end_dot_

 we fight the good fight because it is worth fighting not because we expect to win _meta_end_dot_

 redstate and i support the republican nominee _meta_end_dot_
