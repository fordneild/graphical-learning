  i suspect mama don t want her man spending any more of her sons money _meta_end_dot_

 after all mitt romney spent _meta_dollor_ref_ million in south carolina and did _meta_number_ref_ events in _meta_number_ref_ days in the state _meta_end_dot_

 and he came in fourth _meta_end_dot_

 the spin that he won nevada doesn t work too much for him considering the delegates aren t even awarded right now and assuming he wants to be consistent dismissed mike huckabee s iowa victory for the very same reason _meta_end_dot_

 so the only guy getting significant delegates today is john mccain _meta_end_dot_

 hell of party ain t it _meta_end_question_

 update yeah you guys in the comments are right _meta_end_dot_

 this is a less than gracious post _meta_end_dot_

 but get with the reality of the situation people _meta_end_dot_

 this is why i m so damned frustrated with thompson and romney _meta_end_dot_

 neither of the conservative candidates in the race has been able to close the deal _meta_end_dot_

 romney has spent millions of his own money and thompson had conservative support handed to him on a silver platter _meta_end_dot_

 look at both of them _meta_number_ref_rd and _meta_number_ref_th in the state where conservatives should be controlling the board _meta_end_dot_

 deal with it _meta_end_dot_
