  so this is probably the last thing i saw myself doing nine or ten months ago when i first started seriously following the _meta_number_ref_ race and committed to support sam brownback _meta_end_dot_

 but here i find myself doing it nonetheless _meta_end_dot_

 so i suppose a little bit of explanation here is in order _meta_end_dot_

 in the first place i want to rehash something i said a long time ago nov _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ to be exact about a three way race between romney rudy and mccain more below _meta_end_dot_

 that analysis still stands _meta_end_dot_

 for a while the fred thompson campaign gave me hope for someone who might be a little more solid on the issue but looking at the polling right now leads me inescapably to the conclusion that fred thompson is toast _meta_end_dot_

 he s not polling any higher than third in any state right now and romney has even moved into second in the crucial state of florida _meta_end_dot_

 i just don t know that thompson has what it takes to get back up off the mat right now _meta_end_dot_

 and while i feel a lot better about supporting mccain than i did a year ago i still just can t make myself trust him at all _meta_end_dot_

 i made it a special point to get on mccain s conference call last week so that i could hopefully get just that little assurance i needed to sway me into his camp and in my estimation he blew the question _meta_end_dot_

 like i said i could get behind mccain a lot more easily than i could at this point last year but he still isn t my first choice _meta_end_dot_

 as for huckabee _meta_end_question_

 well let s just say that i lived in arkansas while he was governor and my state tax burden was higher than my federal tax burden _meta_end_dot_

 and also that i worked on jim holt s _meta_number_ref_ campaign _meta_end_dot_

 i hope that explains why i have never seriously considered voting for him _meta_end_dot_

 so what about romney _meta_end_question_

 well you know what _meta_end_question_

 i m going to maintain some intellectual honesty about all of this _meta_end_dot_

 i think a lot of his positions are staked out based on his estimation of what the voters he needs want _meta_end_dot_

 that s not exacctly the most comforting feeling in the world even if you re in the group he needs at the moment as us socons are _meta_end_dot_

 but i have to think at this point that at least on abortion he doesn t have another flip left in him and i think he knows it _meta_end_dot_

 so that s good enough for me _meta_end_dot_

 as for the rest there s a lot to like about mitt romney crank s excellent and well researched series on his weaknesses notwithstanding _meta_end_dot_

 the guy i think did a good faith job of governing as a conservative in a liberal state _meta_end_dot_

 he s shown a real competence at managing organizations which let s face it is a welcome change of pace after the last four years _meta_end_dot_

 his personal history is squeaky clean absolutely no skeletons in the closet _meta_end_dot_

 and i think his health plan will be hated enough by both sides of the aisle that we won t see any national healthcare plan passed during his tenure in office which is a victory in and of itself _meta_end_dot_

 in all other areas i don t seriously doubt that he ll govern as a conservative _meta_end_dot_

 i have in all honesty a lot less doubt about that than i had about bush in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 you know i think one of the things about blogs and the internet is that it s made it a lot easier to go back and nitpick what people have said and that doesn t always do us a service _meta_end_dot_

 we re not always going to get a guy who s been a doctrinaire conservative from birth although the internet has made it so that we expect that _meta_end_dot_

 and if it appears at times that romney is a relentless triangulator well for pete s sake he s a freaking politician _meta_end_dot_

 that s what politicians do _meta_end_dot_

 and if the end result of their triangulation is that they pretty consistently come down where you are then i guess it s time to be happy about that _meta_end_dot_

 the bottom line for me right now is that for all my personal naysaying and doubting i have to admit in the end that romney has worked the hardest run the smartest campaign and outlasted all other republican comers save rudy and we all know how i feel about rudy _meta_end_dot_

 in the end if i had to choose between seeing romney and rudy standing it wouldn t even be a close call _meta_end_dot_

 when i examine the field i see only one candidate left standing with a reasonable shot of winning the white house who would govern as a conservative and that candidate is mitt romney _meta_end_dot_

 so from now on i m tossing in with him for better or worse _meta_end_dot_

 in closing let me say a few things that i hope some romney supporters will take to heart _meta_end_dot_

 it doesn t really do a lot of good to pretend that romney is perfect or that he hasn t made a mistake or that his positions on certain things haven t changed _meta_end_dot_

 that s just insulting to people s intelligence and it turns people off from the candidate _meta_end_dot_

 may i humbly suggest that the better way to convince skeptical republican voters that romney is someone they could support is to encourage them to ask themselves will he govern as a conservative i know that part of the reason it took me so long to come around to this position is that i heard too many people saying the former and not enough repeatedly asking me the latter _meta_end_dot_
