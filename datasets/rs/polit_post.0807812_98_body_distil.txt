  markets are looking healthy and happy so far this morning _meta_end_dot_

 goldman sachs and lehman brothers both announced earnings last night that were putrid but not as bad as expected and both will rise sharply when the stock market opens _meta_end_dot_

 goldman should rise about _meta_percent_ref_ the worry about lehman is that they ll be the next to get what bear stearns got _meta_end_dot_

 but i heard no rumors yesterday that anyone is pulling short term funds out of lehman or that anyone major is refusing to trade with them _meta_end_dot_

 jp morgan is going to open up another _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 the market is confirming my interpretation that they stole bear stearns _meta_end_dot_

 asian and european stock markets all up _meta_end_dot_

 oil gold and grains are all back up somewhat after yesterday s plunge _meta_end_dot_

 the dollar is up against the yen the japanese are breathing easier since it didn t break down below _meta_number_ref_ yen and flat against the euro _meta_end_dot_

 we have a regular scheduled meeting of the federal reserve s open market committee today _meta_end_dot_

 i expect they will drop the fed funds rate a full percentage point _meta_end_dot_

 that news will be out around _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_pm edt _meta_end_dot_

 it s too early to express the hope that the death of bear stearns was the climax of a really bad quarter and things will stabilize from here _meta_end_dot_

 but as long as you remain wary i won t blame you for hoping _meta_end_dot_

 let the debate begin as to whether the federal reserve did the right thing by extending to wall street firms the emergency liquidity facilities normally used by banks _meta_end_dot_

 to me it s very clear that they did the right thing _meta_end_dot_

 steady as she goes _meta_end_dot_
