  at a haverhill townhall meeting two questioners asked about immigration _meta_end_dot_

 below are mccain s responses to the back to back questions _meta_end_dot_

 the second question was about how long it would take to secure the border before moving on to dealing with current illegal immigrants _meta_end_dot_

 senator mccain is the well known sponsor of the mccain kennedy comprehensive immigration reform effort _meta_end_dot_

 the senator learned several lessons from its demise _meta_end_dot_

 first he articulately recognizes that the main reason for failure is because people do not trust the government to secure the border _meta_end_dot_

 he mentions the _meta_number_ref_ amnesty and border security bill that lead to amnesty but not border security _meta_end_dot_

 he seems to understand that voters will not make that mistake again and they want enforcement first _meta_end_dot_

 more analysis below mccain still believes in some form of guest worker program or earned legalization but he is fully on board with enforcement of the border first _meta_end_dot_

 he sees a secure border as a way to win back the trust of citizens and then he would move on to deal with the current illegal aliens in the country _meta_end_dot_

 as a fellow advocate of comprehensive immigration reform mccain s strategic change strikes me as smart _meta_end_dot_

 he will not win over those anti immigrant voters who don t want more immigrants legal or illegal in the country _meta_end_dot_

 but those who are sympathetic to individual and otherwise law abiding illegal aliens but care about the ability of government to fundamental enforce the rule of law and thus want border security before any other immigration reforms should be happy to have converted one of the biggest comprehensive immigration reform advocates _meta_end_dot_

 mccain s specific idea is to require border state governors to certify that the border is secure before moving to any guest worker program _meta_end_dot_

 this stems from his belief that distrust of the federal government makes any federal declaration less trustworthy than a state governor _meta_end_dot_

 since republican primary voters in nh will probably be choosing between huckabee mr _meta_end_dot_

 white guilt rudy mr _meta_end_dot_

 sanctuary city romney mr _meta_end_dot_

 flip flop on illegal immigration and mccain mr _meta_end_dot_

 earned legalization they will have to evaluate what the candidates have done in the past and what they would do if elected _meta_end_dot_

 mccain would not deport illegal immigrants and will lose some hardline votes for that stance but he may also be the best suited to actually secure the border because no one can credibly attack him of being an anti immigrant tancredo type _meta_end_dot_

 perhaps mccain securing the border could be the modern form of nixon going to china _meta_end_dot_
