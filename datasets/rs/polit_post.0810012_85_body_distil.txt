  preceded in this capacity by senator john stennis d mississippi deceased senator robert byrd d west virginia became chair of the senate appropriations committee in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 now despite his advanced age _meta_number_ref_ and diminished capacity he will not leave _meta_end_dot_

 it seems that his staff covets the power _meta_end_dot_

 read on _meta_end_dot_

 jesse jacobs byrd s spokesperson said this the democratic aide speaking on condition of anonymity explained that patty murray of washington did most of byrd s work on the committee last year and will probably continue to do so as byrd lingers and dodders his way around the nation s business _meta_end_dot_

 the infirmities of age are no doubt an unjust reward for a life well lead but there is a time capacities diminish _meta_end_dot_

 is this a case of as one commenter put it _meta_number_ref_ cans short of a _meta_number_ref_ pack _meta_end_question_

 cnn asked famed nazi hunter dick durbin about byrd s capacity _meta_end_dot_

 and he said only not talking about it but last june byrd himself said he reads his speeches on the senate floor from sheets no pun intended with type so large that it seems to go about three sentences per and i cringe as he shakes fearing the ole man will drop one and lose his place _meta_end_dot_

 why he could be waxing about q _meta_end_dot_

 fabius maximus rullianus drop a few sheets again no pun and skip ahead to m _meta_end_dot_

 livius drusus _meta_end_dot_

 his staff might want to cling to power and this is an embarrassment to the dem party just note durbin s terseness _meta_end_dot_

 one way to get rid of him is to get his staff to agree to sign him on as barack obama s veep pick _meta_end_dot_

 it would certainly balance the ticket _meta_end_dot_

 alas though it would thwart the senator s staff in their bid to pave over the last remaining bit of the state of west virginia and name it after their boss _meta_end_dot_
