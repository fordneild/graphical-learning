  now that john mccain has wrapped up the republican nomination for the presidency he is trying to get used to his status as an electoral big shot _meta_end_dot_

 this report indicates some lingering discomfort with the role read on _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 you know something _meta_end_question_

 this is a bad idea _meta_end_dot_

 just because mccain has the nomination wrapped up does not mean that he suddenly has to turn into the gold plated frontrunner _meta_end_dot_

 as the article indicates and as anyone familiar with mccain s history knows mccain is at his best when he is playing the role of a campaign insurgent _meta_end_dot_

 he should continue to do so _meta_end_dot_

 what does he have to lose _meta_end_question_

 everyone believes that barack obama is a rock star and if hillary clinton overtakes him she will be viewed as a rock star given her potential to become the first female president _meta_end_dot_

 mccain an old white guy will never get that kind of treatment and even if he does it is clear that he doesn t take well to it _meta_end_dot_

 so why not stick with what has worked for mccain thus far _meta_end_question_

 why not remain the wisecracking carefree candidate who came back from the political dead to win the republican nomination for the presidency _meta_end_question_

 there is no reason to stop an insurgent campaign now _meta_end_dot_

 mccain should stop thinking of himself as the frontrunner for the republican presidential nomination _meta_end_dot_

 that nomination has been won _meta_end_dot_

 what has not been won however is the general election and the best way for mccain to win it is with the same devil may care nothing left to lose attitude that has helped him succeed in ways that pundits and reporters did not think possible as little as nine or ten months ago _meta_end_dot_

 in short listen to patrick ruffini _meta_end_dot_
