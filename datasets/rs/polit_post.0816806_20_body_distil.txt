  a really outstanding editorial from the washington post upsetting congressional democrats who evidently wouldn t know good news if their lives depended on it _meta_end_dot_

 read as well to get some facts on the specifics of the impending iraqi american agreement that counter the current spin that has iraq serving as the latest addition to the american empire andrew sullivan has been on a particular tear recently denouncing the incipient imperial ambitions of the united states _meta_end_dot_

 one hopes that someone passes along a copy of the editorial his way so that he could perhaps be educated on how things are really developing between the united states and iraq _meta_end_dot_
