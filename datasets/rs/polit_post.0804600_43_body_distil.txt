  just when it appeared house republicans had turned the corner on earmark reform party leaders did the unthinkable _meta_end_dot_

 they picked rep _meta_end_dot_

 jo bonner r ala for the vacant seat on the appropriations committee bypassing conservative rep _meta_end_dot_

 jeff flake r ariz and the opportunity to show they were committed to real reform _meta_end_dot_

 bonner may talk a good game when it comes to earmark reform _meta_end_dot_

 however his record is abysmal _meta_end_dot_

 the three term republican scored just _meta_percent_ref_ on the club for growth s _meta_number_ref_ repork card meaning he voted for just one of the _meta_number_ref_ anti pork amendments offered by conservatives _meta_end_dot_

 andy roth notes that s the same score as liberal reps _meta_end_dot_

 steny hoyer bill jefferson and james moran _meta_end_dot_

 flake on the other hand not only supported all _meta_number_ref_ but he introduced many himself _meta_end_dot_

 the national taxpayers union scorecard paints an even worse picture _meta_end_dot_

 while flake was earning a s consistently bonner was receiving b s and c s _meta_end_dot_

 flake scored _meta_percent_ref_ in _meta_number_ref_ whereas bonner had a pathetic _meta_percent_ref_ on ntu s scorecard for all tax spending trade and regulatory votes _meta_end_dot_

 americans for prosperity president tim phillips called it a huge missed opportunity for true earmark reform and for the republican party of course bonner s record didn t stop minority leader john boehner from trying to spin this as a victory for earmark reformers _meta_end_dot_

 boehner should be smarter than to feed us this line of bull _meta_end_dot_

 even though flake demonstrated his commitment to reform by taking tough votes year after year the house republican steering committee decided bonner s convenient change in rhetoric was enough to pacify taxpayers _meta_end_dot_

 we cannot let the steering committee get away with this sham _meta_end_dot_

 below is a list of the steering committee _meta_end_dot_
