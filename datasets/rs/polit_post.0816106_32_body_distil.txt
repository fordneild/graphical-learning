  tyler cowen has a great editorial highlighting the fact that despite all of the protectionist and antediluvian commentary to the contrary globalization continues to reap wondrous and highly desirable benefits for the international community read on _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 read the whole thing _meta_end_dot_

 and note as well the following statement professor cowen so rightly makes if we are too apologetic about globalization we can feed core irrationalities instead of taming them quite so _meta_end_dot_

 naturally i was directed to the cowen editorial from a cowen blog post _meta_end_dot_

 the post rightly notes that the creation of stronger social safety nets have historically done nothing to alleviate irrational concerns about globalization so the next time someone comes along and tells you that if only we expand government s reach yet again we can have all of the globalization that our hearts desire be sure to check your wallet _meta_end_dot_

 additionally note the referral to this paper which shows yet again one might add that oursourcing has done nothing to drive down wages _meta_end_dot_

 finally let s recall again that there has been one major presidential candidate who has consistently been right on the issues of trade and globalization _meta_end_dot_

 that would be john mccain _meta_end_dot_

 there has also been one major presidential candidate who has consistently been wrong on the issues of trade and globalization _meta_end_dot_

 that would be barack obama _meta_end_dot_
