  by warner todd huston let s give them an a for feeling but an f for history _meta_end_dot_

 photographer rowan benum captured an amusing sign at a pro tibet rally in california not long ago and it says loads about our fetid educational system in the us these days _meta_end_dot_

 history isn t one of the better understood subjects but feelings are there in spades _meta_end_dot_

 read on _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 of course we understand the sentiment _meta_end_dot_

 the nazis now serve as the single worst example of human evil _meta_end_dot_

 say someone is a nazi and you can t get a worse epithet _meta_end_dot_

 and the left in the us just loves to throw that name around at whom ever they don t like _meta_end_dot_

 bush is a nazi bill o reilly is a nazi conservatives are nazis etc etc _meta_end_dot_

 so what s more natural than calling the chinese nazis _meta_end_question_

 after all the chinese may be responsible for killing even more people than hitler ever dreamed of killing and they are still around to rack up an ever higher murder rate _meta_end_dot_

 certainly the russians killed more than hitler did and this always makes me wonder why the word communist is not considered as bad a name to call someone as nazi but i digress _meta_end_dot_

 now the sentiment that the chinese are bad and we should not be allowing them to host the olympics while pretending china is an upstanding member of the international community is one that anyone interested in liberty and freedom should consider salient _meta_end_dot_

 with that sentiment i also agree _meta_end_dot_

 unfortunately someone didn t pay attention to their history teacher in california because as we all know the nazis did host the olympics _meta_end_dot_

 it was _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 and many people of the international community of _meta_number_ref_ wanted the nazis to have the olympics for the same reason that people today think we should allow the chinese to have them _meta_end_dot_

 it will help them become better members of the international community or so goes the theory _meta_end_dot_

 and we can see how hosting the olympics helped the nazis reform themselves to join the international community in _meta_number_ref_ right _meta_end_question_

 sadly our pro tibet protesters need a history lesson _meta_end_dot_

 so does anyone who thinks it a good idea to let china host the olympics _meta_end_dot_

 by the way the little tags at the top of the sign are tibetan prayer cards or flags _meta_end_dot_

 just in case you wondered _meta_end_dot_
