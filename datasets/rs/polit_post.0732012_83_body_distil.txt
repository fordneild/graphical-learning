  as haystack pointed out in his post yesterday this week the house voted in favor of a bill mandating immediate withdrawal of the troops from iraq within _meta_number_ref_ days along with a mission restricted to counterterrorism and training iraqis and a goal of taking out all the troops by the middle of december _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 to use the adjective egergious in descriving this bill is not enough _meta_end_dot_

 it goes without saying that this was an incredibly stupid and badly though out bill but the really sad thing is as michelle malkin has pointed out there were four yep count em four republicans who voted for this too _meta_end_dot_

 amazingly ron paul and wayne gilchrest weren t among them _meta_end_dot_

 maybe the bill was actually just too low and ill conceived even for them _meta_end_dot_

 in any event here are the four republicans who voted for this proverbial white flag english pa shays ct there you have it _meta_end_dot_

 republicans voting with democrats for surrender _meta_end_dot_

 read on _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 now i kind of expect this sort of thing from types like shays and english _meta_end_dot_

 shays is in permanently dangerous territory in connecticut and saw his two fellow republican congresspeople get creamed last year in a tornado of anti war bds fury _meta_end_dot_

 english has been getting targeted by a union front group for not being more aggressive about opposing the war and since he s in pennsylvania i m inclined to say this was a dumb vote but not unforgivable _meta_end_dot_

 that s probably the same for walsh _meta_end_dot_

 but jones _meta_end_question_

 jones _meta_end_question_

 he comes from north carolina _meta_end_dot_

 that s not exactly rough territory for republicans or conservatives and he s voting like a surrendermonkey on this _meta_end_dot_

 even worse a stroll over to one of north carolina s conservative blogs tells me that jones wants to impeach the president and the veep _meta_end_dot_

 this is serious stuff people _meta_end_dot_

 ron paul has already flown the coop wayne gilchrest is off the reservation hopefully for good soon and now we have all this to contend with _meta_end_dot_
