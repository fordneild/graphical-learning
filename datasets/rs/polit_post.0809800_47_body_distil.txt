  there can be no doubt charlton heston was certainly one of the most driven and devoted actors ever _meta_end_dot_

 and he was certainly one of the greatest _meta_end_dot_

 he got into acting for all of the right reasons and never allowed fame to get to his head _meta_end_dot_

 quite the contrary he used fame for the best purposes by thrusting himself into the public sphere and involving himself in civic causes in which he deeply believed _meta_end_dot_

 he was an actor activist in the best sense always ensuring that he was exceedingly well informed about the subject matter he worked on and passionate about spreading his message to others even when his stances threatened to curtail his acting opportunities _meta_end_dot_

 hollywood is not an easy town in which to be a conservative _meta_end_dot_

 but charlton heston showed that it could be done and showed that it could be done well _meta_end_dot_

 ben domenech my redstate colleague has a fine tribute _meta_end_dot_

 it is typical of heston that while receiving praise from a fan he would deflect it back and praise the fan instead _meta_end_dot_

 would that others had so much class _meta_end_dot_

 my family and i would regularly watch the ten commandments every year that it came on around passover _meta_end_dot_

 with passover so near heston has now chosen to leave us _meta_end_dot_

 interesting timing for the old actor _meta_end_dot_

 but i guess that in show business you need to know how to make an exit _meta_end_dot_

 goodbye moses _meta_end_dot_

 we shall miss you _meta_end_dot_
