  today howard dean did something very silly _meta_end_dot_

 he demanded that john mccain apologize for something that tom tancredo said about immigration and the catholic church _meta_end_dot_

 for real _meta_end_dot_

 several problems with this _meta_end_dot_

 first tancredo has not endorsed mccain _meta_end_dot_

 second mccain s position is reasonably close to the catholic church s _meta_end_dot_

 so what is going on _meta_end_question_

 dean s failures at the dnc are leading to his unraveling _meta_end_dot_

 read on _meta_end_dot_

 you see dean has a couple of problems _meta_end_dot_

 first as pejman noted dean is freaking out because the democratic nomination fight is lasting too long _meta_end_dot_

 second john mccain is getting to define himself _meta_end_dot_

 the _meta_number_ref_s and _meta_number_ref_c_meta_number_ref_s which dean doesn t control are not doing their job _meta_end_dot_

 for example progressive media is running ads in washington dc _meta_end_dot_

 third because john mccain is able to define himself he is pulling the republican coalition back together and expanding it into a new winning mccain coalition _meta_end_dot_

 fourth howard dean is getting crushed at fundraising by the rnc _meta_end_dot_

 but that doesn t explain this particular attack you see barack obama has a hispanic problem which is why dean is talking about immigration and a catholic problem which is why he is talking about the pope _meta_end_dot_

 in general democrats are beginning to worry that barack obama may not be electable _meta_end_dot_

 so you see nothing is going right for this guy _meta_end_dot_

 he is looking at being an abject failure _meta_end_dot_

 this bizarre attack trying to link mccain to tancredo is just the beginning of another dean scream
