  constant reader vladimir is covering the latest controversy between jefferson and the government _meta_end_dot_

 but guess what _meta_end_question_

 yup the net s been cast wider via instapundit and yes before you ask i know that the democratic party doesn t actually give a tinker s dam about civic corruption unless they can hang it around a republican s neck _meta_end_dot_

 jefferson s continuing place in the house caucus is proof enough of that _meta_end_dot_

 but it does make me feel better at least to note this sort of thing _meta_end_dot_

 moe lane senator obama of course senator clinton has more sense _meta_end_dot_

 she certainly has more than the dnc given that they re letting him have a vote in their presidential selection process _meta_end_dot_
