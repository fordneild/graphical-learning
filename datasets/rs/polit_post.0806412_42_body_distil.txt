  if we cannot win back pennsylvania s _meta_number_ref_th congressional district we have no chance of taking back the congress that s life the district created in the _meta_number_ref_th congress in _meta_number_ref_ has been in republican hands since the _meta_number_ref_ s it d still be in republican hands if don sherwood could have kept his pants on _meta_end_dot_

 in _meta_number_ref_ chris carney a liberal college professor took the seat this year we at redstate hope to take it back with chris hackett mr _meta_end_dot_

 the _meta_number_ref_th congressional district is an entrepreneurial district it has a median income of _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ and includes the city of carbondale chris hackett knows the district and more so than carney relates to the district _meta_end_dot_

 in an area of pennsylvania where many of the residents either work for themselves or small businesses chris hackett is also an entrepreneur _meta_end_dot_

 having purchased shs techstaffing a recruiting and temp staffing business he grew and expanded the company inside the _meta_number_ref_th congressional district and then through pennsylvania and several other states _meta_end_dot_
