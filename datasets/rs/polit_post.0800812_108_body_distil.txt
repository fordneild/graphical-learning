  so you may have noticed that we have a fundraiser on here at redstate _meta_end_dot_

 we re trying to raise the money to get all the features for our _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ platform that will enhance and enable the blogging experience of our online community _meta_end_dot_

 so why should you volunteer your hard earned after holiday dollars for something you can get for free _meta_end_question_

 because of that word community a community isn t free _meta_end_dot_

 it s the product of all its members _meta_end_dot_

 read on _meta_end_dot_

 to wit we recently lost one of our most important members the blogger known as thomas h _meta_end_dot_

 crown _meta_end_dot_

 now when i joined redstate some two and a half years ago my first experience was a dust up with mr _meta_end_dot_

 crown _meta_end_dot_

 we differed mightily over the harriet miers nomination and things got heated _meta_end_dot_

 six months later thomas and the rest of the redstate editors invited me to become a contributor and thomas went out of his way to communicate to me that while he might still think i was dead wrong on miers he had been wrong on me _meta_end_dot_

 over the last two years we ve become friends _meta_end_dot_

 i value his opinions and respect the strength of his convictions _meta_end_dot_

 the bottom line is that while we may have our differences we are working here to build a community of interesting challenging and ellucidating individuals _meta_end_dot_

 thomas welcome of me after our disagreement demonstrates that the point of redstate is not to collect a group of like thinkers and tune out all other voices _meta_end_dot_

 it is to create an atmosphere where reasonable and serious thoughts get a respectful hearing _meta_end_dot_

 sure things can get a little bumpy some times _meta_end_dot_

 that s part of the fun _meta_end_dot_

 but as we move into this election year the sharing of ideas and opinions facilitated by redstate will be vital to our ability to sift through the data and the spin and the endless analysis firing at us from every corner _meta_end_dot_

 i think the redstate community is worth the work _meta_end_dot_

 and of course the _meta_dollor_ref_ for the apparatus to best support it _meta_end_dot_

 so please consider chipping in today in honor of thomas and all the work he has put into building the site over the years _meta_end_dot_

 contribute here _meta_end_dot_
