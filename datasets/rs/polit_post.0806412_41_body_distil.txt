  redstate will be making several congressional endorsements over the next couple of weeks _meta_end_dot_

 there is one in particular that is near and dear my heart so i ve asked the directors to allow me to put this under my own name though to be clear this is a redstate site endorsement _meta_end_dot_

 in louisiana s _meta_number_ref_th congressional district wherein i am presently situated on vacation at my parents in east feliciana parish there will be a republican elected to congress _meta_end_dot_

 the question is which republican a status quo republican or a principled conservative leader _meta_end_question_

 there is only one choice for real conservative leadership in the _meta_number_ref_th congressional district woody jenkins _meta_end_dot_

 mr _meta_end_dot_

 jenkins at one time one of the youngest members of the state legislature in louisiana has always been a conservative reformer and pro life champion _meta_end_dot_

 when i was in high school mr _meta_end_dot_

 jenkins did not represent my parish and yet i felt compelled to go hold up signs for him because he was and is one of the greatest champions of the pro life cause louisiana has ever known _meta_end_dot_

 and he s not just a social conservative _meta_end_dot_

 woody jenkins battled it out on the floor of the state legislature for years against entrenched democrats and republicans who lived off taxpayer dollars _meta_end_dot_

 mr _meta_end_dot_

 jenkins was never shy about publicly chastising both democrats and his fellow republicans who acted more like democrats in a status quo approving louisiana legislature that put graft and greed before the people _meta_end_dot_

 woody jenkins is the man we need to send to congress from the _meta_number_ref_th congressional district _meta_end_dot_

 he has several opponents _meta_end_dot_

 most are more of the same that we would come to expect from louisiana _meta_end_dot_

 a few are leadership flunkies and hangers on from retiring representative richard baker s band of followers _meta_end_dot_

 they re all well meaning people but there is only one candidate who i know from personal experience will lead with principled conviction and has under trials and tests stayed true to his convictions _meta_end_dot_

 that is why i m pleased to write redstate s endorsement of woody jenkins for congress _meta_end_dot_

 if you live in louisiana s _meta_number_ref_th congressional district please be sure to get out and vote on saturday for woody jenkins _meta_end_dot_
