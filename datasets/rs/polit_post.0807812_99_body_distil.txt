 barack obama is about to deliver a major speech in response to the controversy surrounding the recent revelations of the teachings of his church s pastor rev _meta_end_dot_

 jeremiah wright _meta_end_dot_

 while the press which has largely ignored the entire controversy is destined to praise whatever obama says and declare the matter settled it is worth a look at what obama could possibly say that would accomplish that end _meta_end_dot_

 update drudge has the text of the speech posted _meta_end_dot_

 snipets below _meta_end_dot_

 read on _meta_end_dot_

 i find it hard to believe that obama will come out in this speech and denounce rev _meta_end_dot_

 wright _meta_end_dot_

 obama has been a member of trinity church for _meta_number_ref_ years _meta_end_dot_

 wright married him baptized his children and has served as a spiritual mentor a self described uncle for all of that time _meta_end_dot_

 furthermore in obama s few comments on the controversy he has hinted that the statements god damn america riding dirty america is a nation controlled by rich white people and hillary ain t never been called a ni_meta_beep_ref_er are taken out of context and are not representative of the long history of rev _meta_end_dot_

 wright s teachings _meta_end_dot_

 in other words obama has tied himself closer to wright since the scandal broke not distanced himself _meta_end_dot_

 to do so now by denouncing him or publicly announcing his resignation from membership in trinity would be an obviously politically motivated act and one not worthy of the senator from h o p e the non political candidate _meta_end_dot_

 at the same time obama certainly cannot come out and embrace wright s commentary on america _meta_end_dot_

 to the extent that this new examination of wright s beliefs and by extension obama s concurrence with them has damaged him it has been because obama has assured the voters that he has matured beyond the racially tinged sniping of characters like rev _meta_end_dot_

 jesse jackson and rev _meta_end_dot_

 al sharpton _meta_end_dot_

 he has to distance himself without looking like he is distancing himself _meta_end_dot_

 it is for that reason that obama s speech today is most likely to be unremarkable _meta_end_dot_

 the safest course for him to take as well as the least impressive and newsworthy is to decry the whole scandal as part of the politics of the past _meta_end_dot_

 this is the theme of obama s entire campaign _meta_end_dot_

 he bills himself as a non politician unconcerned with petty attacks and baseless charges even as he responds to the kitchen sink campaign being waged against him by sen _meta_end_dot_

 hillary clinton _meta_end_dot_

 obama may seek to straddle the fence subtly defending the experience of the black church while not specifically embracing wright s rhetoric _meta_end_dot_

 but if he remains true to his campaign thus far he will decide that sometimes it is better to say nothing than to take a side _meta_end_dot_

 the speech is set to begin at _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 update looks like obama will try to be all things to all people _meta_end_dot_

 the speech contains elements of distancing condemnation explanation and embrace of wright and his comments _meta_end_dot_

 there s much more _meta_end_dot_

 i encourage you to read the whole thing _meta_end_dot_
