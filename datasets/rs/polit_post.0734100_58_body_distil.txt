  i missed _meta_number_ref_ gop presidential hopeful mitt romney s address this morning and i haven t read the transcripts _meta_end_dot_

 i ve read some reviews though which have ranged from the bizarre to the more useful _meta_end_dot_

 now for romney s speech to have been a success it had to convince people that he was telling the truth and that he was the natural standard bearer for all that s good about religion in our nation _meta_end_dot_

 in the latter sense it was a response to mike huckabee _meta_end_dot_

 i just called a bit of analysis useful follow the link above it was written by the ap s ron fournier who might have been motivated simply to trash a republican i don t know but hit right away on the nodus for team mitt read on wrote rf and that is romney s problem _meta_end_dot_

 i do not know that it is possible for mitt romney to fix his credibility crisis as i do not find him credible _meta_end_dot_

 this is not to say that he is not a great man that he would not make a good president rather how do i vote for someone i cannot trust _meta_end_question_

 he s trying to sell himself as a president of the united states and by george pun intended he seems to be saying whatever he must to do so _meta_end_dot_

 by all accounts this was a nifty speech but it remains to be seen if it accomplished a thing _meta_end_dot_
