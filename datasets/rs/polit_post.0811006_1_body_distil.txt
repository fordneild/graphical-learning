  in france the government of right of center president nicolas sarkozy has proposed to punish the promoters of extreme dieting with up to two years in prison _meta_end_dot_

 a libertarian faction of the french national assembly has protested stating that criminalizing behaviour has no place in public health policy this latter position is to be applauded _meta_end_dot_

 except _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 i wasn t exactly truthful with you just now dear readers _meta_end_dot_

 the protesting faction got the principle right but they are hardly libertarians _meta_end_dot_

 i suppose that i shouldn t be surprised _meta_end_dot_

 still this is the kind of political fight that makes me wish there was no internet to inform me about it _meta_end_dot_

 i may root for sarkozy s political opponents on this particular issue _meta_end_dot_

 but i feel as if i need to shower after having done so _meta_end_dot_
