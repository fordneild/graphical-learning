  we all know democrats have their own culture of corruption _meta_end_dot_

 easy hits like murtha s abscam bribery charges which never stuck because he didn t actually take the money yeah i ll leave the earmarks his district and his son directly benefit from out of it for now are getting old _meta_end_dot_

 of course there s the little matter of william jefferson who actually did take the money and hide it in his freezer _meta_end_dot_

 and we shouldn t fuss over his brother sister and niece now being indicted as well _meta_end_dot_

 no there s just as much fun to be had rounding up the scandal scum outside the beltway _meta_end_dot_

 there is a green bubbling democrat froth on the pond inside the beltway to be sure but this week we thought we d bring you a couple of the seven deadly sins from new jersey and from maryland and from north carolina and a teaser or two from alabama _meta_end_dot_

 just to keep things light and fluffy _meta_end_dot_

 from money laundering to conspiracy to bribery and mail fraud to corruption to perjury and obstruction of justice to extortion with a little sexual harassment thrown in for the easily titillated and everything in between democrats make the redstate posse s work long and tedious but we re sworn to serve and that s what we ll do _meta_end_dot_

 this week s blotter below the fold _meta_end_dot_

 let s start with north carolina shall we _meta_end_question_

 interestingly there are a couple sidebar pointers to other democrat corruption scandals in nc wow the democrats are real busy over there in the tar heel state but hot off the presses comes this little gem from the first line state a little to the north in maryland great gig if you can get it _meta_end_dot_

 be an outside consultant to a business in your district where you can steer legislation that might favor them as a state senator and get paid by them as well _meta_end_dot_

 democrats do these things _meta_end_question_

 nah can t be but we can t leave nc without mentioning this little gem moving on to alabama and birmingham s mayor langford we find that the sec is a little out of sorts over langford s lust for dollars what a great life it is to be a local democrat politician the money is awesome _meta_end_dot_

 up in new jersey orange s mayor resigned and plead guilty to extortion who says money can t buy happiness err i mean power _meta_end_question_

 of course over in passaic their mayor was busy pleading guilty to corruption charges you know every time i hear a democrat promise to help me i grab for my wallet but that s just me i guess _meta_end_dot_

 i was going to leave out the kwame kilpatrick fiasco but how could i _meta_end_question_

 the charismatic hip hop mayor sporting a diamond stud in his ear just makes our job here too easy another episode of hope and change going to hell in a handbasket oh well we ll see what detroit does with this guy on june _meta_number_ref_ and take it from there _meta_end_dot_

 let s end our first blotter with a high note one which teaches us that even after a conviction democrat scum can retain their public service pension ok folks we end with a request from the redstate posse _meta_end_dot_

 you can help us find and shed light on these cockroaches _meta_end_dot_
