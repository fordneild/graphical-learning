  the great charles krauthammer has a piece in the washington post that i have to take issue with _meta_end_dot_

 i m sure mr _meta_end_dot_

 krauthammer will live titled an overdose of public piety the piece makes the case that candidates for office are making too much of their religious bona fides or the relative lack of them in their opponents _meta_end_dot_

 in support of his conclusion krauthammer cites recent examples like mike huckabee apparently crediting jesus for his rise in the polls mitt romney s faith in america speech and the cnn debate in which the republicans were asked if they believed every word of the bible literally _meta_end_dot_

 krauthammer would like the candidates to stop talking about themselves in terms of their religious beliefs and confine their appeal to their positions on issues _meta_end_dot_

 i take no issue with that _meta_end_dot_

 but he goes too far when he suggests that voters too should have no interest in the religious beliefs of the candidates _meta_end_dot_

 on that point i disagree _meta_end_dot_

 read on here s how krauthammer puts it _meta_end_dot_

 krauthammer s point is that religious tests are inherently bad _meta_end_dot_

 while he points out that the constitution s prohibition of them restrains only the government he extends the argument to apply to the voting public as well _meta_end_dot_

 basically he says it s none of a voter s business what the personal religious beliefs of a candidate are _meta_end_dot_

 the problem with this line of reasoning is that it seems to be based upon the assumption that all religions are equal _meta_end_dot_

 this is clearly not true _meta_end_dot_

 modern mainstream christianity and judaism are not prone to violent suppression of non adherents _meta_end_dot_

 the jury is still out on islam _meta_end_dot_

 the practice of islam in some parts of the world includes violence against unbelievers and apostates _meta_end_dot_

 a muslim candidate must therefore distance himself from more radical elements in his religion to remain viable and justifiably so while a christian or jewish one does not _meta_end_dot_

 similarly some religions have rituals that are just bizarre _meta_end_dot_

 would a snake handler deserve no scrutiny of his beliefs if he were an otherwise credible candidate for office _meta_end_question_

 what about a pentecostal _meta_end_question_

 would it be out of bounds to ask the candidate if he she ever spoke in tongues _meta_end_question_

 a satan worshipper _meta_end_question_

 no questions _meta_end_question_

 a wiccan _meta_end_question_

 mike huckabee is being asked to answer for some tenets of southern baptist faith s teachings _meta_end_dot_

 i see nothing wrong with this _meta_end_dot_

 john kerry was confronted about his differences with his catholic faith as should rudy giuliani _meta_end_dot_

 mormonism orbits on the fringes of christianity if it is indeed christian _meta_end_dot_

 christian voters may contemplate their support for a mormon candidate based in part upon his religion _meta_end_dot_

 those voters should educate themselves about mormonism if they intend to be informed voters _meta_end_dot_

 and they should also be able to get information from mitt romney in the process _meta_end_dot_

 religions are not equal and indeed say something fundamental about the believer _meta_end_dot_

 the point here is to learn about the candidate not determine who is the most pious _meta_end_dot_

 krauthammer and i may agree that a voter who makes a decision solely on the candidate s religious identity is doing the process a disservice _meta_end_dot_

 but that is a long way from saying that they should be vilified as being un american for even asking the question _meta_end_dot_
