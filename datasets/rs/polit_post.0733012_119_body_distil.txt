  as vladimir noted senator trent lott r ms will leave the senate before the end of the year _meta_end_dot_

 trent lott long ago stopped being useful and started being bitter _meta_end_dot_

 he hates the porkbusters _meta_end_dot_

 he hates conservatives _meta_end_dot_

 he hates most anything other than establishment republican ideals of entrenched power and earmarks _meta_end_dot_

 that s sad because he was always a good brass knuckles fighter _meta_end_dot_

 we lost a lot when we replaced him with bill frist and he got all bitter and bent out of shape _meta_end_dot_

 so now we have a leadership fight on our hands _meta_end_dot_

 we need to get a conservative in his spot _meta_end_dot_

 with kbh leaving the senate we shouldn t be seeing her step up to the plate for this job _meta_end_dot_

 we re going to need a cornyn a sessions a demint or somebody solidly conservative to be the whip and to balance out an increasingly squishy mitch mcconnell _meta_end_dot_

 i d encourage you to sign up for our action alerts and we ll keep you posted on who to call to make sure a good conservative gets the job _meta_end_dot_
