  it seems somehow fitting that this week s annapolis conference on palestinian statehood featuring appearances by israel the fatah leadership of the palestinian west bank saudi arabia syria and other regional players will be taking place just over a year from the time that president george w _meta_end_dot_

 bush is scheduled to leave office _meta_end_dot_

 in what has become somewhat of a time honored tradition among recent american presidents president bush like bill clinton before him has turned a hopeful eye to the levant as a solution to his legacy problem as the time for him to leave office draws near _meta_end_dot_

 like his predecessor the bush and his presidency stand to be remembered largely for poor choices big government policy and abysmal public relations the latter not being a trait shared by the clintonistas rather than for any large successes in the domestic or foreign policy realms _meta_end_dot_

 in an attempt to correct or obscure this bush and secretary of state condoleezza rice are venturing forth into the well traveled territory of the israel palestine conflict in hopes of succeeding where all others have failed and creating a lasting peace between the jewish state and her arab enemies _meta_end_dot_

 read on _meta_end_dot_

 unfortunately as they have done in other areas of foreign and domestic policy to poor result the bush administration has once again decided to ignore history and are attempting to negotiate this middle eastern peace plan built of course on israel s giving away both land and sovereignty in the same fashion and with the same terms as those who have failed in the past have done while inexplicably hoping for a different result _meta_end_dot_

 the apparent drive to salvage their legacy before it is too late has driven the administration to make several mistakes in their push for middle eastern peace through the annapolis conference whose purpose has been radically altered since it was first proposed by the president this summer as a means of measuring the progress of palestinian institutions the first and arguably the largest of these mistakes is the fact that the administration is allowing palestinian and arab representatives a seat at the negotiating table and thereby conferring legitimacy upon their positions in the exchange without setting the recognition of israel s right to exist as a precondition _meta_end_dot_

 unfortunately the president used his position as head of the negotiations to issue ultimata to israel while kowtowing to arab governments in hopes that the promise of concessions rather than a desire for actual peace would spur them to show up at annapolis _meta_end_dot_

 an example of this is syria a state which has officially been at war with israel for nearly _meta_number_ref_ years the damascus government agreed to attend only after it was promised that the potential return of the golan heights would be on the table rather than making concessions to israel s neighbors in exchange for their promise to simply grace the conference with their presence the administration should have made clear that stipulating that israel has a right to survival is a requirement for beginning any peace process rather than being used as a point of negotiation by regional representatives _meta_end_dot_

 the second of these mistakes is the decision to follow the lead set by previous administrations and failed negotiators who set the precedent of unilateral concessions by israel as a starting point for peace negotiations _meta_end_dot_

 among the massive concessions the administration is asking israel to make this time in the name of peace is the abandonment of judea and samaria and a return to the state s pre _meta_number_ref_ borders a move which would not only make the over _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ israelis living in those areas into refugees but more importantly would also eliminate the security buffer currently created by the territories of the west bank thereby deeply threatening the jewish state s security _meta_end_dot_

 in an era when arab fighters are employing rockets and other standoff weaponry moving the border of an unregulated palestinian state up to the border of israel would not only endanger israeli citizens living in those border areas but would also put major coastal cities like tel aviv which is a mere eleven miles _meta_number_ref_ km from what would be palestinian land well within range of katyusha rockets _meta_end_dot_

 further the administration is expected to propose the transference of sovereignty over arab neighborhoods in jerusalem to the palestinians and the surrendering of israeli sovereignty over the sacred temple mount in that city _meta_end_dot_

 as if that weren t enough an agreement regarding the so called palestinian right of return the right of palestinians to re populate the areas they left or were driven from during the _meta_number_ref_ war for israeli independence is expected to be on the table as well _meta_end_dot_

 were this last to be agreed to and acted upon israelis would immediately become a tiny minority in their own country _meta_end_dot_

 the third major mistake lies in the administration s assumption that the palestinians and their leaders as well as the surrounding nations actually desire peace with israel in the first place despite the fact that history seems to clearly show otherwise _meta_end_dot_

 since the last israeli palestinian cease fire was agreed to last november inhabitants of the gaza strip south of israel have launched nearly _meta_number_ref_ homemade qassam rockets fashioned from water pipes was anybody wondering why gaza has no infrastructure _meta_end_question_

 and rebar and filled with nails and ball bearings at the israeli town of sderot as well as at the israeli power plant which provides gaza with electricity _meta_end_dot_

 though secretary rice has publicly stated her belief that the palestinian people hold the same fundamental values and worldview as americans and are equally desirous of peaceful prosperous lives a brief look at palestinian state television clearly demonstrates just how different the palestinians view of quality of life is from americans and israelis _meta_end_dot_

 the glorification of suicide bombers or martyrs and the veneration murdering israelis as the ultimate goal to strive for in life on children s programming is standard fare on both hamas and fatah funded state television _meta_end_dot_

 the sermons and speeches aimed at adults are far worse _meta_end_dot_

 in april of _meta_number_ref_ president bush wrote a letter to then prime minister ariel sharon in which he reiterated his commitment to israel s keeping of the defensible borders created in _meta_number_ref_ when the tiny jewish state took on its massive neighbors and defeated them in battle _meta_end_dot_

 unfortunately for israel it appears that the quest for legacy has led yet another american president to attempt to tread the path of least apparent resistance to middle eastern peace thus far this path has always passed through israeli concessions and arab gains with no positive results and it is most unfortunate that the man who has arguably been the most pro israel president in recent history would cast reality aside and follow in the failed footsteps of his forbears _meta_end_dot_

 the israeli palestinian conflict cannot be solved in the mere fourteen months that president bush has remaining in office _meta_end_dot_

 it especially cannot be solved through unilateral israeli concession many of the details of which almost exactly mirror the concessions that former prime minister ehud barak agreed to and plo leader yasser arafat walked away from under clinton _meta_end_dot_

 the fact that the bush administration is going down this well traveled path in the last months of its tenure clearly demonstrates that clich d attempts at legacy saving are more important to the president and his secretaries than are meaningful policies _meta_end_dot_

 further the fact that bush and rice are going about doing this in exactly the same failed manner that their predecessors clinton and albright did only seven years ago in fact rice consulted clinton as well as former president jimmy carter on how best to go about negotiating a peace settlement demonstrates that the decision makers in the administration are apparently content to maintain for the duration of their remaining time in office the same lack of historical and practical understanding that led them into the other foreign and domestic policy mistakes that they have made to this point _meta_end_dot_
