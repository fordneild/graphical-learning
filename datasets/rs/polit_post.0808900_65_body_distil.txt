  the other night at a chamber of commerce event in south carolina u s _meta_end_dot_

 house majority whip jim clyburn said it was his constitutional mandate to earmark _meta_end_dot_

 he also said that the elimination of earmarks would not save one dime despite the fact that earmarks accounted for over _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ billion of federal budget last year _meta_end_dot_

 let s start with the five rivers scandal _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 in _meta_number_ref_ congressman clyburn set aside _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ for the five rivers development corp _meta_end_dot_

 to build a community center _meta_end_dot_

 according the myrtle beach sun news but it doesn t stop there _meta_end_dot_

 the sun news also discovered clyburn s use of federal money to benefit his family members didn t stop their _meta_end_dot_

 just this month clyburn stepped down from the board of the international african american museum because his nephew s architecture firm the same firm from the five rivers scandal was going to benefit from another federal earmark _meta_end_dot_

 the charleston post courier reported i m guessing clyburn decided to stick around on the museum s board just long enough to make sure his family made some money off of federal tax dollars and then got tired of going to meetings _meta_end_dot_

 maybe i m missing something but the last time i read the u s _meta_end_dot_

 constitution i didn t see anywhere it says that members of congress shall find sleazy ways of using federal tax dollars to get their family members a piece of the action _meta_end_dot_

 but for some reason clyburn thinks that it his constitutional mandate to use our tax dollars to line the pockets of his family _meta_end_dot_

 when you re filling out _meta_number_ref_ irs form over the next few weeks just make sure to ask yourself how much of your money is going to the clyburn family fund _meta_end_dot_

 then ask your congressman and senator if they are willing to stop this type of behavior by supporting earmark reform _meta_end_dot_
