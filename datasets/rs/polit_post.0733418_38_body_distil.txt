  dear duncan fred john mike mitt ron rudy and tom the cnn youtube debate was a disgrace _meta_end_dot_

 the blame lies largely with cnn which wanted republican voters to meet their republican candidates but only on democrats terms _meta_end_dot_

 they did so by portraying the gop as women arresting gun toting confederate flag waving simpletons _meta_end_dot_

 you and we need a do over as soon as possible _meta_end_dot_

 redstate and human events are happy to combine forces and offer the following _meta_end_dot_

 we have a base of readers who represent the republican wing of the republican party _meta_end_dot_

 you and the republican party deserve to face the questions posed by undecided republicans not democratic activists _meta_end_dot_

 we will solicit and obtain youtube videos from those people and vet each questioner to establish that they are really undecided republicans _meta_end_dot_

 we hope to include soldiers in the field in iraq young republicans and others who still have not decided among you _meta_end_dot_

 today allow us to make you this offer we will organize a debate at a time and date amenable to you all _meta_end_dot_

 we will work with a national broadcaster to broadcast the debate as well as offer it online _meta_end_dot_

 we not the liberal drive by media will ensure the questioners are who they say they are _meta_end_dot_

 and we will choose them based on criteria that will be fully disclosed to you all which ensure the questioners aren t activists for any democratic candidate _meta_end_dot_

 it s time to start talking to republican voters about issues that will help them choose the republican nominee _meta_end_dot_

 this could be a very good way to do it _meta_end_dot_

 it can be done _meta_end_dot_

 we re happy to help do it _meta_end_dot_

 are you game _meta_end_question_

 sincerely jed babbin erick erickson
