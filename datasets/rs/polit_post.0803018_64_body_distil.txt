  as perhaps one of the most cynical people around i couldn t help but wonder what business caroline kennedy had endorsing barack obama and then reading through the teddy wail as he gushed all over this new kid on the block i finally understood _meta_end_dot_

 the kennedys need the clintons gone so they can retake the democrat party and make it their own once again _meta_end_dot_

 of course had teddy boy possessed even a thumbnail s worth of the abilities his brothers enjoyed he might have been elected and served a second term as president _meta_end_dot_

 that might have been enough to keep the clintons from ever having reached the top of the democrat heap in the first place _meta_end_dot_

 instead teddy s miserable failure s wound up playing a primary role in the decline of the family name in politics of course the crimes alleged and never proven for most of the clan will not be mentioned by me what s that _meta_end_question_

 i just did _meta_end_question_

 ooopsies quite sorry _meta_end_dot_

 picking obama to ostensibly re live the glory days of the families kennedy is really a very bad idea for what it s worth _meta_end_dot_

 you see joseph was able to build the dynasty on the back of err umm questionable activities later to be made illegal _meta_end_dot_

 clinton likewise i did not mention whitewater _meta_end_dot_

 obama is just too squeaky ckean to rise atop this pile well ok so he played with a few technically illegal hobbies as a youth but who hasn t _meta_end_dot_

 bedding down with barack and the oprah will likely not turn out very well for teddy boy and frankly i think it only cheapens what little there is left of a fine heritage of political giants in their time and place in american history but who am i to get in the way of teddy making a fool of himself again _meta_end_question_

 i can t help wondering what jfk rfk and even joseph p _meta_end_dot_

 might have to say were they alive to see this mess ted s making of the family brand _meta_end_dot_

 more below the fold _meta_end_dot_

 cribbing from a segment i heard on the laura ingraham radio program let me just point out this so called new jfk holds to none of the positions espoused so willfully by john fitzgerald kennedy _meta_end_dot_

 jfk believed in a strong defense he believed in tax cuts he believed our enemy communism back then was evil _meta_end_dot_

 and he believed we the people should be looking for ways to give to our country rather than holding our hands out expecting something from our government _meta_end_dot_

 obama is none of these things running to the shirt tearing squeals from liberal progressives everywhere on the premise that government is the solution to all our problems and that making kissy face with our enemies will somehow be a better strategy moving forward for getting along with everyone in the world they re decent people you see they re just misunderstood and we re just being meany heads _meta_end_dot_

 honestly for anyone to suggest this obama character should even be mentioned in the same breath as camelot is for a whole slice of our population to have overdosed on jim jones kool aid and teddy boy has apparently signed up to be bartender _meta_end_dot_

 the democrats might actually be longing for camelot like we seem wont to pine for our reagan but obama _meta_end_question_

 maybe we all need to take a deep breath and look honestly at ourselves in the mirror asking just exactly why it is we have this obsessive compulsive disorder of making politicians some weird mutation of an urban legend _meta_end_dot_

 how bout we get back to the business of running a country with some pretty basic yet profound issues that need serious grownup attention and quit all this national enquirer politicking we got going on lately _meta_end_question_
