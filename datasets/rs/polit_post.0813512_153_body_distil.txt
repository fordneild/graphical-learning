  the baby just woke up so let me make this quick _meta_end_dot_

 via instapundit if they bring back a guilty verdict i ll be shocked if it goes to sentencing _meta_end_dot_

 rezko will want to make a deal and he knows the magic word blagojevich it s considered impolite to say by many but everybody reading this knows that illinois state politics is one happy bipartisan mess of corruption influence peddling bribery and a wide variety of other activities prosecutable under the rico act _meta_end_dot_

 it may be too much to hope that flipping rezko will result in the kind of housecleaning that jindal is trying down in louisiana but at least the cockroaches will scurry with any luck some of them out of the usa altogether _meta_end_dot_
