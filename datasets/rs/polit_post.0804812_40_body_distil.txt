  no i m being quite serious _meta_end_dot_

 when i first saw this which comes via talkleft the title these kinds of sexist remarks are not what i am looking for should give you an idea of their reaction my general conclusion was merely stone cold dumb expletive deleted of obama for letting that come out wrong _meta_end_dot_

 then i remembered that i m a knuckle dragging reactionary neanderthal of a gop fascist patriarch so i did what knuckle dragging reactionary neanderthal gop fascist patriarchs do in such cases i went and asked my wife what i should be thinking _meta_end_dot_

 i got an earful _meta_end_dot_

 while my better half and i should note for the record that my wife is a the sole wage earner of the family b has a doctorate in aerospace engineering c is a right wing moderate with a lifetime nra membership and no intention of voting democratic in this election normally looks upon my political enthusiasms with the same polite supportive disinterest that she reserves for my love of the cthulhu mythos on this topic she has an opinion which you may read after the fold _meta_end_dot_

 read on _meta_end_dot_

 the following was typed out by her i haven t edited it at all except to blockquote it _meta_end_dot_

 see here s the problem my wife s brighter than i am and while i can read about the issues involved in being a woman in a traditionally male field she s the one actually dealing with it every day _meta_end_dot_

 while personal experience is by no means a trump card in this sort of dispute it isn t actually irrelevant either _meta_end_dot_

 so when i see her get a little quiet and set about the mouth about something she s seen or written well i don t have to agree but i probably should start taking it seriously _meta_end_dot_

 so is senator obama a misogynist _meta_end_question_

 i _meta_end_dot_

 don t think so _meta_end_dot_

 but if he s being told right now not to worry about the reaction that women will have to this comment well possibly he should get a second opinion on that _meta_end_dot_

 moe lane one thing that i ve noticed from meeting various of my co bloggers we knuckle dragging reactionary neanderthal gop fascist patriarchs seem to do fairly spectacularly when it comes to marrying well _meta_end_dot_

 at least the ones of us who blog _meta_end_dot_

 hardly seems fair doesn t it _meta_end_question_
