  we have all gotten bundled up in angry exchanges over the immigration reform debate _meta_end_dot_

 some have articulated their cases poorly others have used shrill and false accusations as a means of self defense _meta_end_dot_

 but whatever lies ahead for our immigration problems and whether how they ll be solved no one can faithfully argue that laws currently on the books shouldn t be enforced while we wait for them to be changed immigration law or any other laws for that matter _meta_end_dot_

 so how is it that something like this can happen in this day and age_meta_beep_ref_ i just can t help wondering why our political heroes don t see that a border fence they have already approved should have long ago been financed and built _meta_end_dot_

 these are simple matters they don t require years of researching hundreds of polls and dozens of election cycles to figure out _meta_end_dot_

 more below the fold _meta_end_dot_

 there is an inherent value and benefit in making people actually have to work at coming and going between america and mexico _meta_end_dot_

 a man is dead leaving behind a wife and _meta_number_ref_ children solely because washington fears negative backlash from people who do not come here legally or abide by our laws when they get here _meta_end_dot_

 this is just ridiculous and does not hold any signs of hope for improvement any time soon _meta_end_dot_

 according to the american conservative union s coverage of the aguilar murder and that s really what this is how many indeed _meta_end_dot_
