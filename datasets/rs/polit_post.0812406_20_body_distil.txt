  barack obama has come out against the gas tax holiday that is being pushed by senators mccain and clinton _meta_end_dot_

 obama s reasoning is defensible he believes that a temporary lowering of gas prices will increase demand especially now that we are heading into the peak summer driving period thus eventually further reducing supply and causing the price to spike _meta_end_dot_

 at the end of the day obama argues that a gas tax holiday is hardly a short term solution to the problem of high gas prices let alone a long term solution _meta_end_dot_

 let s grant that for a moment _meta_end_dot_

 what then to make of this _meta_end_question_

 oil companies don t make as large of a profit as people think and they must contend with an exceedingly volatile pricing structure _meta_end_dot_

 what s more the tax will be self defeating _meta_end_dot_

 surely obama must know that oil companies will only try to find ways to pass the costs of a windfall profits tax on to the consumer _meta_end_dot_

 with their lower than thought profit margins this almost becomes a necessity _meta_end_dot_

 obama has gotten a lot of praise regarding his stance on gas tax and the proposed gas tax holiday _meta_end_dot_

 but where is the recognition that his plan for a windfall profits tax will in fact make things a lot worse for people when they have to purchase gas _meta_end_question_
