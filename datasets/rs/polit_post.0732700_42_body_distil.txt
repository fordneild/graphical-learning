 we simply can t let a thanksgiving go by without being made to feel simply awful as a result of rapacious white europeans betraying and eventually murdering rousseau s noble savage in bunches _meta_end_dot_

 this line of thinking leads to a rather interesting conclusion europeans should have stayed in europe allowing only asians to emigrate to north and south america _meta_end_dot_

 if european naval technology had been just a little less advanced we very well could be speaking some asian tongue today or perhaps even polynesian given the enormous skill and intrepidness of their sailors _meta_end_dot_

 the last great migration from asia may have occurred as recently as _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ bc according to some exhaustive yet controversial linguistic studies _meta_end_dot_

 but if european ship building improvements had lagged by just a couple of hundred years north america would have been a ripe target for settlement by any number of asian cultures _meta_end_dot_

 then it would have been rapacious yellow men who would have gotten tagged with killing the native population _meta_end_dot_

 that s because it didn t matter who came the clash of civilizations was inevitable _meta_end_dot_

 failing to understand our early history in the context of the history of migrating peoples from the time that homo sapiens first moved out of africa is shallow stupid and these days politically motivated _meta_end_dot_

 it doesn t absolve white people of murder nor does it lessen the tragedy of the destruction of native american culture _meta_end_dot_

 but thinking in these terms should animate our total understanding of the history of our continent and our country something the modern day left whose guilt ridden diatribes against our ancestors always sounds such a discordant note on this the most unique of american holidays deliberately ignores in order to prove their solidarity with the oppressed _meta_end_dot_

 all of that was in the future when the pilgrims held the first thanksgiving in the fall of _meta_number_ref_ in recognition of the help given to them by the cape cod indian tribe the mashpee wampanoag _meta_end_dot_

 by that time the pilgrim s numbers had been dramatically reduced by disease losing more than half the number that landed at plymouth rock _meta_end_dot_

 the indians had no doubt contributed to the survival of the remainder by showing them how and where to fish as well as introducing them to some native american crops like maize and beans _meta_end_dot_

 but what we tend to forget about the pilgrims is that they were not explorers or people inured to hardship _meta_end_dot_

 they were country folk from the midlands of england most of them were not farmers or possessing the skills necessary to begin a colony _meta_end_dot_

 they were simple townsfolk whose separatist ideas about the church of england landed them in trouble with the authorities so much so that they were driven out of the country _meta_end_dot_

 first to holland where their religious views were tolerated but where parents were concerned that the children were losing their essential englishness and pined for the homeland _meta_end_dot_

 that s when william bradford made a deal with the london company for a land patent and the crossing was planned _meta_end_dot_

 so here they were arriving in the waters of the new world in early november _meta_number_ref_ but not making a landing until nearly a month later _meta_end_dot_

 it was then they began to hack a civilization out of the wilderness _meta_end_dot_

 whatever skills they had with the ax or hammer they were forced to perfect while constructing a few rough hewn buildings over the winter of _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 only _meta_number_ref_ of the original _meta_number_ref_ pilgrims who began the crossing survived to see that first spring _meta_end_dot_

 the mayflower stuck around until april _meta_number_ref_ supplying the colonists with whatever food they couldn t beg trade for or steal from the indians _meta_end_dot_

 they were poor hunters had few firelocks and were not familiar with the local fauna so were unable to procure food through the gathering of nuts and berries as the native americans did _meta_end_dot_

 the indians worked diligently to remedy this and by the summer of _meta_number_ref_ the pilgrims were nearly self sufficient _meta_end_dot_

 thanks to massasoit sachem of the wampanoags who had signed a peace treaty with the pilgrims earlier in the spring the new americans were able to plant tend and harvest their first crop with little trouble _meta_end_dot_

 it wasn t much _meta_end_dot_

 a peck of corn meal for each family a week a peck is _meta_number_ref_ dry quarts during the winter along with some salt fish _meta_end_dot_

 they supplemented this with wild fowl they hunted and trapped _meta_end_dot_

 all in all barely enough to survive on _meta_end_dot_

 but considering their hardships suffered during the previous year it seemed bountiful enough that they were able to entertain and feed _meta_number_ref_ wampanoags and the entire colony for a week of feasting _meta_end_dot_

 these were hardy determined people who put up with difficulties almost all of us today would never survive _meta_end_dot_

 we tend to forget that these first pilgrims made something out of absolutely nothing with just a few tools and the sweat of their brow _meta_end_dot_

 and a nice assist from the wampanoags who had their own selfish reasons for helping _meta_end_dot_

 a devastating plague probably an extremely virulent form of smallpox that the wampanoags caught from french traders reduced their numbers dramatically leaving them vulnerable to their enemies the narragansett tribe _meta_end_dot_

 no doubt massasoit eyed the pilgrim flintlocks with more than a little envy _meta_end_dot_

 i realize that many native americans are not celebrating today _meta_end_dot_

 more the pity for them _meta_end_dot_

 recognizing the achievement of the pilgrims taken by itself as an admirable effort by people regardless of their color to survive and prosper in a hostile and unfamiliar world should elicit the praise of all who can appreciate their extraordinary accomplishments _meta_end_dot_

 what followed may have been a tragedy _meta_end_dot_

 but don t take it out on the original pilgrims _meta_end_dot_

 they lived in peace with the indians for _meta_number_ref_ years long after the last mayflower survivor died _meta_end_dot_

 perhaps we could leave this tiny corner of american history alone this year by allowing us the pleasure of remembering the pilgrims for what they were brave souls who conquered their fears and with an indomitable spirit created a settlement of godly men and women who were able to express their religious beliefs freely as an example to all _meta_end_dot_
