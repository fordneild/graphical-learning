  the reverend jeremiah wright sen _meta_end_dot_

 barackobama s spiritual mentor and pastor for over twenty years source of the hopechangehopechange mantra that has become the messianic core of his empty campaign and giver of the obama couple s nuptial vows recently gave an interview to bill moyers about the recent dustup caused by the revelation to the general public that wright has frequently used his pulpit to preach a racist hateful and intolerant brand of so called christianity to the members of his megachurch including the surprisingly not so post racial obama clan _meta_end_dot_

 in the sit down one of the less coherent segments of which was treated by redstate s absentee earlier today the reverend wright made a very interesting comment about his former flock member s philadelphia speech on race and religion made in the head of the wright gate media frenzy _meta_end_dot_

 more below the fold including video and an accurate analysis from a most surprising source _meta_end_dot_

 in that march speech obama claimed that the rest of the country read the white part couldn t understand wright s demonization of white people because they weren t black and that those racist white people that make up a chunk of the american population whose only crime was the color of their skin sound familiar had a long way to go to become as post racial as he was _meta_end_dot_

 perhaps most notable in that philadelphia speech was obama s refusal to throw his racist hateful minister under the bus _meta_end_dot_

 whether out of a deep abiding agreement with the god damn america message offered by wright or out of a sense of obligation to the black church pastor whose early tutelage and endorsement helped the not quite black enough obama gain the street cred he needed to first gain chicago public office obama refused to denounce wright saying i can no more disown him than i can disown the black community rather than pay back his star former pupil in kind wright used the moyers interview to utter a phrase that served to toss obama and his beyond politics as usual campaign message under that same bus that obama helped wright dodge only a month ago _meta_end_dot_

 said wright emphasis added now i could of course use my own words to explain the obvious major problem with this description by the man who knows obama better than perhaps any other of how the supposedly post political candidate thinks acts and speaks to the general read gullible public _meta_end_dot_

 however it s just so much more fun to let the head exploding lefties over at mydd do it for me _meta_end_dot_

 so quoth todd beeton forgive the english in the quote as he appears to be less than familiar with how to actually communicate in our nation s unifying language
