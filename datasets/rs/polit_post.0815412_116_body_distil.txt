  based on what the press is reporting about the democrats great compromise to allow the seating of the previously disenfranchised florida and michigan delegations you may believe you understand that the democrats reached a reasonable and fair compromise giving each florida and michigan delegate half a vote _meta_end_dot_

 according to the press reports the democrats will allow each vote to count and still punish florida and michigan for violating the party s rules about how soon primaries could be held _meta_end_dot_

 that is what the democrats did for florida but not michigan _meta_end_dot_

 no for michigan the democrats decided to do a little of their creative counting of every vote _meta_end_dot_

 according to cnn hillary managed to win the michigan primary clinton _meta_percent_ref_ kucinich _meta_percent_ref_ gravel _meta_percent_ref_ based upon the votes hillary earned _meta_number_ref_ delegates and obama none _meta_end_dot_

 fifty five delegates should be uncommitted _meta_end_dot_

 instead of agreeing to seat a michigan delegation based on the actual votes the democrats cut a deal to let every vote count that allows hillary to have _meta_number_ref_ delegates and gives obama _meta_number_ref_ delegates _meta_end_dot_

 watch harold ickes one of hillary s chief advisers explain the undemocratic nature of the way the democrats creatively counted michigan votes the rules and bylaws committee _meta_number_ref_ elite members of the democrat party substituted their judgment for _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ michigan voters and gave obama four pledged delegates specifically won by hillary and _meta_number_ref_ delegates the voters said should be uncommitted _meta_end_dot_

 the democrats fuzzy math never ceases to amaze me _meta_end_dot_
