  i suppose that this should come as no surprise whatsoever _meta_end_dot_

 but it is still appalling those who want the best for zimbabwe should be quite worried at this state of affairs _meta_end_dot_

 and they should be doubly determined to see that tyranny will not prevail over the clearly expressed will of the people to see mugabe gone _meta_end_dot_

 his party has been ousted from its governing position in parliament _meta_end_dot_

 mugabe himself should follow his party to ignominy and hopefully eventual prosecution for the crimes he perpetrated during his time in power _meta_end_dot_
