  this video which dan highlighted in the diaries is for my money the best ad of the entire campaign season thus far it is just another exhibit of the fact that of all the campaigns mccain s seems to be hitting its stride at just the right moment as the huckaboom starts to fade romney s early state strategy looks shaky thanks in no small part to mccain s own resurgence in new hampshire rudy continues slide both nationally and in early state polls and fred thompson remains inexplicably on the mat _meta_end_dot_

 as republican voters have gone throughout the ridiculously early _meta_number_ref_ primary campaign they have had occasion to consider in turn the effect that the potential nominations of rudy romney and huckabee would have on the conservative coalition and mccain seems to be emerging in the mind of many as the good enough candidate and his bona fides as a general election candidate are bolstered by his consistent strong polling performances against hillary clinton _meta_end_dot_

 yet to me it still looks inevitable that mccain will ultimately come up short at the convention _meta_end_dot_

 more below _meta_end_dot_

 the main problem that mccain has right now is that he lacks a plausible path to the nomination _meta_end_dot_

 his ascendence in new hampshire has been very impressive and he has won both of the last two debates i saw by being the adult in the room _meta_end_dot_

 as he dared to knock ethanol pork in front of iowa reminded the fiscal conservatives that mccain is probably the candidate who sits most in their corner when it comes to spending not just taxes _meta_end_dot_

 his strong rhetoric in favor of the war has convinced many potential rudy supporters that he will be as strong in the prosecution of the war as giuliani would be _meta_end_dot_

 and during this campaign season he has made all the right noises about supporting life issues _meta_end_dot_

 however the fact remains that after new hampshire comes a string of states in which mccain remains relatively anemic in the polls making it difficult to imagine how he would turn a new hampshire win into a win in michigan or south carolina and he desperately needs one of those states to avoid total decimation in florida _meta_end_dot_

 in short while i d be fine if mccain got the nomination i just don t see a way that it can happen _meta_end_dot_

 i think a reason for that is that a lot of republican voters share pretty much the same view of mccain as i do _meta_end_dot_

 we personally admire his character and his life story and we ve come around to the idea that his positions are not so far away from ours _meta_end_dot_

 but in the back of our minds we all have reason to remember at least one instance when he stabbed us in the back whether through mccain feingold the gang of _meta_number_ref_ or comprehensive immigration reform _meta_end_dot_

 and many of us have questions about his temperament and ability to manage the leviathan that is the federal bureaucracy well this remains the one reason why i still have mitt romney as my first choice _meta_end_dot_

 so perhaps the problem for mccain is that he has put himself in a position to be the second or third choice of almost everyone but the first choice of a relative few _meta_end_dot_

 the good news for mccain is that primary voters can in some circumstances display a remarkable ability to display a sort of subconscious emergent behavior _meta_end_dot_

 it may be that sometime between new hampshire and south carolina we will all decide that settling for mccain is a better option than risking huckabee giuliani insert your worst nightmare here _meta_end_dot_

 i know that it seems far fetched that such a decision could be made by random unconnected voters in distinct separate locales but this is the primary season and we have seen stranger things happen _meta_end_dot_

 and right now it seems that despite the fact that mccain is hitting his rebound stride at exactly the right time this is exactly what he needs to have happen _meta_end_dot_
