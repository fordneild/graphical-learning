  for years i ve had conversations with friends in politics that all conclude with something like this we re never going to fix the republican brand until we get our leadership to start recognizing that what a brand is and that candidates need to sell themselves not by looking at other candidates but by looking at nike yesterday barack obama s audacious brand continues to triumph _meta_end_dot_

 marketed with dazzling skill to the high end consumer and the conformist college age millennial it enables obama to make a much broader appeal as a unifying force in spite of his narrow policy views _meta_end_dot_

 he s the iphone of politics sleek sexy and pop culture and even as only _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ percent of the market last year everyone even the nonpolitical know the brand instantly _meta_end_dot_

 as patrick ruffini noted in his own analysis of obama the brand the end result is that great brands are fungible _meta_end_dot_

 they can be all things to all people _meta_end_dot_

 the branding approach liberates obama to be the candidate of the moveon wing and of national unity _meta_end_dot_

 that s not a criticism _meta_end_dot_

 it is a compliment last night though we also started to see a few chinks in this hopechangeobama brand _meta_end_dot_

 see while the benefits of marketing a candidate like anything in a box are enormous it s a dangerous game to play _meta_end_dot_

 read on consumer brands are more recognizable they are more unifying and they have a broader appeal _meta_end_dot_

 but when the american people are increasingly voting based on a desire for authenticity it still matters what s actually inside the box you re selling _meta_end_dot_

 if you promise people tea and cake and it turns out to be death well they re not exactly going to be saying omg ponies _meta_end_exclamation_

 and if your brand is a new entry into the marketplace and you don t have a lot of built up goodwill and gravitas well you can be rebranded by your opponents before you know it _meta_end_dot_

 the signs that the big rock candy mountain candidate gave off last night were not the signs of a brand that has staying power _meta_end_dot_

 the clinton campaign has essentially goaded him into giving longer more typically political speeches laundry lists of programs and bureaucratic expansions that make him sound like a typical politician not a candidate of hopechange _meta_end_dot_

 it leads to scenes like this the sort of promises that can win you a democratic primary in wisconsin hands down but will come back to bite you in a general election as thomas put it those folks on the other side attack the failed policies of the last eight years as a cure they offer the failed policies of the last century the obamanation doesn t seem to recognize this yet but the promises made now just aren t going to play the same way in a general election _meta_end_dot_

 robert samuelson s column on the obama delusion in the post is getting a lot of linkage today and it deserves it while naturally inclined to like obama he still sees a broad distance between brand and reality emphasis mine if you think that s the sort of thing that mccain mr _meta_end_dot_

 straight talk an old brand a slow brand but one built on decades of action to back it up isn t going to be able to peel back in a drawn out general well you re fooling yourself _meta_end_dot_

 but even if he has to do it without the help of the msm without further investigation of what obama really offers beneath all that packaging it can be done _meta_end_dot_

 as jennifer rubin notes there s a meme that s emerged over the past few months that obama is despite resting in age between the runoff of the baby boom and the first gen xers the label fits in large part millennials are a responsible bunch but they still have a mess of conflicts they say they hate materialism yet spend scads of money they re socially conscious but don t have long memories and they re the most secular and the most evangelical generation on record at the same time _meta_end_dot_

 their personal lives are extremely conservative they drink and use drugs at much lower rates than any generation since the _meta_number_ref_s and they share those straitlaced conservative attitudes toward sex the abstinence figures and pregnancy rates are just astounding and a plurality of them are pro life but they re solidly on the left on the environment and the size of government _meta_end_dot_

 they re optimists trusting of most authority and passionate about civic duty _meta_end_dot_

 yet there s something else here too something that the left should realize is a bigger concern than the political horserace of the moment this voting bloc is massive young and fickle _meta_end_dot_

 they ll turn on a dime after seeing some paparazzi photos and a segment on tmz _meta_end_dot_

 one day you re hannah montana the next you re britney spears _meta_end_dot_

 just imagine how they would ve reacted to dukakis in the tank with _meta_number_ref_ million hits on youtube and you get the idea _meta_end_dot_

 be warned lefties _meta_end_dot_

 empty promises may sway the millennials for this election but putting all your audacious hopes of great society redux in one basket with obama must have the intended result once you get the candidate out of the box regardless of how good the branding is it still has to work _meta_end_dot_

 the past two democrat administrations have been trainwrecks and now you re trusting a guy with no executive experience and a team of political has beens to achieve glorious hopechange with a bar set in the stratosphere _meta_end_dot_

 when it comes to the future of conservatism perhaps the best result for this election and for our future would be the old man beating the kid _meta_end_dot_

 the lesson for the left even when you packaged it with flowers and puppies and a bright pink bow you still couldn t sell mcgovernism to the american people _meta_end_dot_

 but even if obama wins he has to deliver and it now appears like after all that sturm und drung all he s bringing to the table is a bunch of old failed ideas _meta_end_dot_

 the millennials are too young to remember the welfare state but they ll remember what happens next _meta_end_dot_
