  when the new majority implemented pay go spending rules last fall the american people thought they were getting a check on runaway congressional spending not an excuse to raise taxes _meta_end_dot_

 congress would offset any dollar of new government spending we were told with spending reductions in other areas _meta_end_dot_

 sadly this year the majority has done nothing to change its profligate ways _meta_end_dot_

 congress spending proposal came out _meta_dollor_ref_ billion over the president s budget request an overall increase of over _meta_number_ref_ percent from last year s levels _meta_end_dot_

 instead democrats have used pay go as a pretext for a wave of new tax increases _meta_end_dot_

 their strategy disguised in the garb of fiscal responsibility threatens to deal a decisive blow to american prosperity at a tense moment for our economy _meta_end_dot_

 how does their stealth work _meta_end_question_

 consider the ongoing logjam over congress attempt to patch up the alternative minimum tax amt _meta_end_dot_

 because this tax was never indexed for inflation _meta_number_ref_ million additional taxpayers this year will be caught in its ever expanding web swelling the ranks of amt payers to _meta_number_ref_ million _meta_end_dot_

 previous congresses have implemented a patch for middle class amt payers _meta_end_dot_

 but the inaction of this congress has placed _meta_number_ref_ million taxpayers at risk of a _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ tax increase this fiscal year _meta_end_dot_

 read on _meta_end_dot_

 you have to smile at democratic claims that opponents of amt offsets are trying to pass the costs of the patch on to our children and grandchildren _meta_end_dot_

 that s because another amt patch would not increase the federal deficit _meta_end_dot_

 preventing _meta_number_ref_ million unsuspecting taxpayers from getting clubbed for the first time by an alternative tax hardly constitutes a spending increase or a new tax cut _meta_end_dot_

 the government has never collected amt revenue from these taxpayers and never intended to _meta_end_dot_

 house democrats refuse to accept that reality _meta_end_dot_

 the opportunity to sell tax hikes as offsets is too tempting _meta_end_dot_

 conveniently characterizing the patch as new spending the house used a one year amt fix to muscle through an antigrowth _meta_number_ref_ percent tax hike on investment partnerships _meta_end_dot_

 the ill conceived democratic legislation which passed last month increases taxes ostensibly to cut taxes _meta_end_dot_

 the amt struggle magnifies the differences between the two parties as we formulate tax policy for the future _meta_end_dot_

 the democrats budget baseline for pay go assumes more than just the revenue from _meta_number_ref_ million amt payers _meta_end_dot_

 it assumes that the republican tax cuts of _meta_number_ref_ and _meta_number_ref_ which lifted us from the depths of recession and fueled extraordinary economic growth will expire in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 taken together these assumed revenues amount to an unprecedented _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ trillion tax increase on the backs of american families _meta_end_dot_

 the democrats inflexible adherence to this flawed form of pay go puts the house at odds with the senate which passed a clean amt patch on thursday _meta_end_dot_

 more importantly it imperils congress s ability to put america on sound economic footing _meta_end_dot_

 as we slog through a difficult economy the last thing american families need is to be hit over the head with new tax hikes _meta_end_dot_
