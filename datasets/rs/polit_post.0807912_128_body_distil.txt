  i want to add a few more thoughts _meta_end_dot_

 first jim gergahty makes an excellent point _meta_end_dot_

 if obama really does want to transcend and move beyond race why raise his daughters in a church whose pastor cannot move beyond race and preaches liberation theology _meta_end_question_

 second but for obama s obvious hypocrisy on the issue i d be willing to give him a pass _meta_end_dot_

 i cannot however because though he says he wants to move beyond race he has chosen to embrace as his mentor a man who cannot move beyond race and has chosen to raise his family in that presence _meta_end_dot_

 nonetheless for purposes of this post let s ignore the obama conundrum _meta_end_dot_

 let s all admit that but for hillary clinton we d never be at this point in the campaign _meta_end_dot_

 but for hillary clinton obama tried to run a campaign devoid of race _meta_end_dot_

 obama did in fact try to transcend race _meta_end_dot_

 he did in fact move beyond the legacy of racism in this country and preached a message of hope and change however vacuous and empty that message may be _meta_end_dot_

 but the clintons are covetous of the white house _meta_end_dot_

 they want to be back there _meta_end_dot_

 and they will say and do anything to get back there including but not limited to the wholesale destruction of the democratic party through incitement of a race war _meta_end_dot_

 bill now denies his race baiting in south carolina _meta_end_dot_

 it took the campaign long enough to really engage in that spin _meta_end_dot_

 but we know from hillary s plane ride out of iowa that they were already considering inciting latino voters against obama _meta_end_dot_

 and now they ve decided to incite white voters against obama _meta_end_dot_

 they have played into white fears that obama really is someone who harbors animosity toward white citizens and is incapable of moving beyond our history obama is as the clintons have portrayed him no better than reverend wright _meta_end_dot_

 at the end of this campaign i want it on record that it was not the republican party that castigated obama as a hypocrite _meta_end_dot_

 it was not the republican party that inflamed race relations in this country to hurt obama _meta_end_dot_

 it was not the republican party that leaked the reverend wright videos _meta_end_dot_

 it was the clintons a political party unto themselves who did all of these things _meta_end_dot_

 and if the clintons are allowed to succeed we really will never move beyond the politics of personal destruction _meta_end_dot_

 but of course the clintons will succeed simply because they will stop at nothing to get back to the white house _meta_end_dot_

 yes yes i realize obama is not a hypocrite because you actually have to stand for something beyond platitudes to be a hypocrite when you fail to live up to standards _meta_end_dot_

 nonetheless his soaring rhetoric does not match up to who he has actually chosen to surround himself with _meta_end_dot_
