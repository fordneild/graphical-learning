  the pritzkers are one of the leading business families of chicago _meta_end_dot_

 they run hyatt and have a reputation for particularly cut throat business practices _meta_end_dot_

 sometimes outside of honorable so it isn t entirely surprising to find penny pritzker at the center of barack obama s hypocrisy over his relationship to subprime lenders _meta_end_dot_

 earlier today i wrote about jim johnson who got a sweetheart deal from countrywide which obama had attacked _meta_end_dot_

 and then there was ubs which his campaign shopped a story about and the reporter didn t point out that the ceo of ubs has raised a quarter million for obama _meta_end_dot_

 and then there is penny obama s finance chair _meta_end_dot_

 she was the former chairwoman of a bank that failed according to regulators via a _meta_number_ref_ chicago tribune article due to poor oversight by its board the depositors felt so screwed that they filed a rico suit against penny and other directors _meta_end_dot_

 the pritzker family eventually settled with regulators for _meta_dollor_ref_m _meta_end_dot_

 so obama is attacking ceos of subprime lenders _meta_end_dot_

 and his finance chairman was the chairman of a subprime lender that went under because of poor oversight _meta_end_dot_

 one of his major donors is the ceo of another one _meta_end_dot_

 and the person making his vp recommendation got a sweetheart deal from another _meta_end_dot_
