  it will not come as news to rs readers but barack obama the supposed candidate of hope and change has an awful lot of connections to the same old failed personalities and policies of the past _meta_end_dot_

 jim johnson went under the bus because his history clashed with obama s self righteous denunciations on the mortgage crisis _meta_end_dot_

 but there are a number of suspect characters still left advising the presumptive democratic nominee _meta_end_dot_

 eric holder and greg craig for example _meta_end_dot_

 and it seems the cuban american community in florida doesn t appreciate it craig isn t afraid of taking on controversial cases and of course holder played a key role in the pardon of marc rich among others in addition to his work in sending elian back to cuba for more read on _meta_end_dot_

 so how does the obama campaign react to the justified objection the folks in florida have toward obama choosing advisors such as craig and holder _meta_end_question_

 they do what they always do change the subject just another distraction i guess _meta_end_dot_

 watch this cnn video on the subject and see if you can spot an answer from obama s camp just more disappointment that people dare attack obama and no real explanation for his willingness to be associated with these two gentlemen _meta_end_dot_

 our own soren dayton was calling for craig to be fired back in may and holder has been under fire as well yet the obama campaign continues to ignore the issue and pretend it doesn t exist _meta_end_dot_

 it seems to me that the only conclusion to draw from all of this is that obama simply doesn t care _meta_end_dot_

 he assumes that he can get away with the massive cognitive dissonance of his campaign for a new politics while being advised by characters like greg craig and eric holder _meta_end_dot_

 delf n gonz lez disagrees and is making his voice heard _meta_end_dot_

 it is up to the voters of florida to prove gonz lez right and obama wrong _meta_end_dot_
