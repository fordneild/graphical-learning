  why isn t obama man enough to apologize _meta_end_question_

 this morning on the today show barack obama claimied he never leveled the dishonest attack that john mccain supports a _meta_number_ref_ year war in iraq we have been through this before but obama continues the distortions even though obama acknowledges mccain was speaking bbout a post war situation like south korea not a _meta_number_ref_ year war non partisan fact checkers call it distortiion non partisan factcheck org calls dnc attacks on _meta_number_ref_ years comment a serious distortion and a rank falsehood non partisan politifact com calls obama attacks on _meta_number_ref_ years comment false the washington po st s factchecke r obama s false claims do not pass the pinocchio test numerous media outlets agree that democrats have mischaracterized senator mccain s position in his book the audacity of hope obama writes that voters are tired of distortion name calling and sound bite solutions to complicated problems this is exactly the opposite of what obama is doing with his continuing distortions and misrepresentations about what senator mccain actually said _meta_end_dot_

 obama promised better _meta_end_dot_

 obama should apologize to mccain and the nation for his blatant dishonesty and join senator mccain in his call for tolerance and respect _meta_end_dot_

 if obama does perhaps we can engage in a new politics a new civil politics different than obama s chicago rules _meta_end_dot_
