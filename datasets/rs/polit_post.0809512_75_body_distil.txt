  our dear friend steny hoyer is no stranger to mucking things up in congress _meta_end_dot_

 he has a passion for delaying and withholding and obstructing and otherwise putting off anything meaningful that might come out of congress until he gets something for himself out of it _meta_end_dot_

 the esteemed mr _meta_end_dot_

 hoyer is also no stranger to the democrat strategy of talking out of both sides of one s mouth _meta_end_dot_

 hoyer says via the ap piece hmm _meta_end_dot_

 why then did hoyer tell roy blunt on the house floor yesterday that other things were being discussed before the much needed supplemental for our soldiers would get any closer to being done _meta_end_question_

 mr _meta_end_dot_

 hoyer at this point in time soldiers are still in iraq and are still in need of supplies and ammunition and all the other things those troops need to be supported as blunt s release indicates can we please let go of katrina or at least detach it from the war in iraq _meta_end_question_

 can we please focus single mindedly on the one iraq supplemental and put all the blackmail earmarks in something else _meta_end_question_

 how about you guys on the left hold up fisa to get your lard keep us at risk here at home and leave the deployed men and women out of your little schoolyard shenanigans _meta_end_question_
