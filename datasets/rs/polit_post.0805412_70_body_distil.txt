  we ve heard iran s president and his diatribe about israel often enough to get the basic point we want israel to go away and we want to own the middle east we know he plans on having nukes regardless his strained denials and insistences to the contrary _meta_end_dot_

 there s really no reason to even attempt to convince ourselves there is anything but hostile intentions despite all the democrats running for president who promise to be open minded and in obama s case actually sit down with these lunatics for a mocha latte and cookies and look for a peaceful relationship with them _meta_end_dot_

 now apparently lebanese lunatic nasrallah wants a piece of that action as well i wonder does the reference to several years fall solely to coincidence in the larger context of iran s nuke program _meta_end_question_

 we are to believe as much apparently _meta_end_dot_

 our democrat presidential wannabes refuse to look at the reality of what iran would do were they to have this capability _meta_end_dot_

 obama has even gone so far as to promise open talks without pre conditions _meta_end_dot_

 how do you think that conversation will go _meta_end_question_

 more below the fold _meta_end_dot_

 iran s building them despite their vehement denials and they are quite sure they have every good and righteous reason to use them against israel when the time comes _meta_end_dot_

 as history has shown the democrats will wait and wait and wait and they ll react to this problem after the mushroom cloud begins to dissipate over the dead sea with a few oopsies and a couple of my bad press conferences for good measure _meta_end_dot_

 god help them and the rest of the muslim world that surrounds israel _meta_end_dot_

 it s one thing to lose a few jihadists to the collateral damage of a bomb vest _meta_end_dot_

 they don t know enough or care that millions of them will go down along with israel when mahmoud presses the button _meta_end_dot_

 apparently suicide bombing on such a scale appears to be a really wicked cool idea in the minds of the martyrs or they haven t thought this through well enough to recognize there will be no one left to rule the region when the smoke clears _meta_end_dot_

 either way this is a very bad situation that is going to get a whole lot worse _meta_end_dot_

 the only consolation what little of it there is rests with israel itself _meta_end_dot_

 they at least will not sit around hoping lebanon syria and iran are telling the truth they are prepared to actually do something about it before it s too late _meta_end_dot_

 meanwhile our democrat presidential hopefuls tune their fiddles _meta_end_dot_
