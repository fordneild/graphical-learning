  a fascinating story has been making the rounds in the last week or so _meta_end_dot_

 in its balder and less coherent forms the idea you re supposed to get from it is that america s banks are out of money and the news media are studiously covering up an impending financial disaster _meta_end_dot_

 have you heard this howler _meta_end_question_

 it s backed up by data about the reserve levels of us banks published by none other than the federal reserve _meta_end_dot_

 wouldn t you think that if america s banks were one good push away from total meltdown that the fed would at least have the good sense to shut up about it _meta_end_question_

 except that the whole thing is nothing more than a misinformed reading of the fed s data _meta_end_dot_

 and not to put too fine a point on it some of the people pushing this non story appear to be ron paul supporters _meta_end_dot_

 more _meta_end_dot_

 the fed regularly publishes a report called aggregate reserves of depository institutions and monetary base also called h _meta_number_ref_ this is the report i linked above _meta_end_dot_

 the title alone ought to work on you if you have a hard time falling asleep _meta_end_dot_

 it s nothing more than a statement of the reserve position of us banks depository institutions _meta_end_dot_

 what are reserves _meta_end_question_

 simplistically they re the sum of monies deposited by banks with the federal reserve plus their vault cash banks are required to maintain reserves so they can meet unexpected demands for withdrawals _meta_end_dot_

 add total reserves to the amount of currency paper money out in circulation and apply a handful of seasonal and other adjustments and you get what s called the monetary base of the us _meta_end_dot_

 at this moment minimum required reserve levels amount to about _meta_dollor_ref_ billion and actual reserves are a little more than that _meta_end_dot_

 the monetary base is in there at about _meta_dollor_ref_ billion give or take _meta_end_dot_

 what s this report telling us that has some people so exercised _meta_end_question_

 well before i tell you that let me tell you how banks get their reserves in the first place _meta_end_dot_

 the fed itself creates them _meta_end_dot_

 banks can either borrow them from the fed at an interest rate called the discount rate or they can come from the fed itself as it adds and subtracts reserves on a daily basis _meta_end_dot_

 the fed breaks out the two types and reports them as borrowed and non borrowed reserves _meta_end_dot_

 in terms of maintaining a reserve position it doesn t matter whether reserves are borrowed or non borrowed as long as each bank keeps its total number high enough _meta_end_dot_

 so banks will get their reserves in the cheapest possible way _meta_end_dot_

 now this is where some people got their panties in a knot _meta_end_dot_

 if you examine h _meta_number_ref_ going back to mid december you ll see that the non borrowed reserves category plunged from nearly _meta_dollor_ref_ billion all the way down to its current level of negative _meta_dollor_ref_ billion _meta_end_dot_

 and people have published graphs showing that there has never ever been a similar decline in non borrowed reserves much less one taking place over only six weeks _meta_end_dot_

 omigod _meta_end_exclamation_

 doesn t that mean that america s banks all weighed down with subprime mortgage losses are out of money _meta_end_question_

 they must have lost all of the non borrowed cash they had and kept borrowing all the way into the hole _meta_end_exclamation_

 brace yourselves folks but i ve even heard some of these people suggest that america s banks are one big northern rock the large british retail bank that suffered a panic run last year and had to be rescued by the bank of england _meta_end_dot_

 pay no attention _meta_end_dot_

 what actually happened is the fed set up what it called a term auction facility taf back in early december _meta_end_dot_

 you may not have been aware of this given that the fed s interest rate cuts have dominated the news but the fed and the european central bank have been taking steps to back up the value of asset backed securities since the subprime crisis started _meta_end_dot_

 one of the things they did was to issue frequent repurchase agreements which add liquidity to the financial system on a short term basis _meta_end_dot_

 a repo is either a borrowing or a lending by the fed usually overnight or over weekend but sometimes longer and collateralized by a variety of asset classes _meta_end_dot_

 since last august the fed began accepting certain mortgage backed securities as collateral for repos thus adding greatly to the perception of value in these securities _meta_end_dot_

 the term auction facility is broadly speaking an extension of the same idea _meta_end_dot_

 since mid december the fed has made it possible for banks to bid for reserves against several different assets including mortgage backed securities at interest rates no lower than the current fed funds rate _meta_end_dot_

 since fed funds are lower than the discount rate as they usually are it makes rational sense for banks to get their reserves by borrowing them from the taf _meta_end_dot_

 their reserve levels are no lower than normal it s just that they ve shifted category from non borrowed to borrowed _meta_end_dot_

 the reason non borrowed reserves are negative is simply because banks can and usually do hold more reserves than they re strictly required to _meta_end_dot_

 so if you hear from some wild eyed ron paul supporter that you need to run to your bank and pull all your money out just offer him twenty bucks to hold your place in line _meta_end_dot_

 payable only if there actually is a line of course _meta_end_dot_
