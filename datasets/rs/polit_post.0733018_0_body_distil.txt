  here s your must read of the day from patrick ruffini _meta_end_dot_

 we should all stop underestimating john mccain now _meta_end_dot_

 he s going for the independents in new hampshire again and might throw a wrench in romney s plans _meta_end_dot_

 when pat hynes told me that mccain was going to surge i thought he had been smoking something _meta_end_dot_

 turns out the mccain camp just might know what it s doing _meta_end_dot_

 and as much as i detest these global warming pushes they are working with independent voters _meta_end_dot_
