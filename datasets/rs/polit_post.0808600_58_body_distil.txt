  michael dobbs fact checker site is helpful in discerning fact from fiction and he s been pointing out plenty of fiction when it comes to hillary s story about her trip to bosnia _meta_end_dot_

 here s what hillary originally said video from cbs news made clear that there was no sniper fire there was a greeting ceremony on the airport tarmac and none of the american dignitaries ran or had their heads down _meta_end_dot_

 here s how dobbs relayed sinbad s account more below the fold _meta_end_dot_

 granted sinbad is an obama supporter but i have to go with the comedian on this one dobbs original post here _meta_end_dot_

 when it became all too apparent that hillary lied here was her blubbering response as dobbs helpfully notes this wasn t the first time hillary misspoke about her visit and she s still maintaining that the air force base was a dangerous place at that time _meta_end_dot_

 it wasn t _meta_end_dot_

 all i can say is no wonder she s losing to a freshman senator who s more liberal than she is _meta_end_dot_
