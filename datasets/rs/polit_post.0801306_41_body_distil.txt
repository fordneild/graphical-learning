  remember that lancet study on iraq deaths that was so poorly researched and so widely discredited that even anti iraq and america alarmist site iraq body count refused to accept its ridiculously inflated conclusion of _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ iraqis killed since the _meta_number_ref_ invasion _meta_end_question_

 well the sunday times online is reporting that the study was funded by you guessed it george soros _meta_end_dot_

 here s guessing that liberals the world over will rush to his defense since as you know lies made up facts trumped up atrocities and yes lies are perfectly acceptable on the part of the left when it s for a greater good and make no mistake to these folks anything that paints the u s _meta_end_dot_

 as a force for terror and murder in the world and pushes more americans to demand that we withdraw from iraq and surrender it and the rest of the region to islamofascist terrorists is indeed for the greater good
