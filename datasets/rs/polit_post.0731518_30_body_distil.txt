  the associated press and reuters are busy contributing to the nation s preparation for next year s presidential election by covering the democratic candidates efforts to woo voters in iowa _meta_end_dot_

 the headline above is the one the ap is using _meta_end_dot_

 the ap s john glover tells us that glover had some words about john edwards but as he put it it was the matchup between clinton and barack obama that was watched closest over at reuters john whitesides says that if you were wondering what the two leading wire services are telling the american people about what the republican candidates are doing at this exciting time the answer is _meta_end_dot_

 well _meta_end_dot_

 virtually nothing _meta_end_dot_

 that s right both of the wire services that american newspapers use to inform their readers about political events wrote long glowing articles about what the democratic candidates said yesterday _meta_end_dot_

 what did the republicans say in their speeches _meta_end_question_

 nada _meta_end_dot_

 yesterday romney was in new hampshire _meta_end_dot_

 the only story the ap filed was about the questions about romney s mormon faith that have dogged him during the primary campaign reuters had nothing about romney s activities in new hampshire _meta_end_dot_

 rudy giuliani was in loveland colorado _meta_end_dot_

 there s no telling what he did there neither wire service had a word about it _meta_end_dot_

 mike huckabee was in new hampshire _meta_end_dot_

 i don t know what huckabee did either there s no news story about him _meta_end_dot_

 mccain was also in new hampshire _meta_end_dot_

 whatever he did it wasn t news _meta_end_dot_

 neither wire service said a word about it _meta_end_dot_

 the ap did do a story today about mccain attending a ceremony at a veterans cemetery this morning _meta_end_dot_

 reuters passed _meta_end_dot_

 if a newspaper without its own reporters covering the candidates really wanted to tell its readers what both parties candidates were doing they might turn to the french wire service agence france presse afp _meta_end_dot_

 the afp did do an article entitled democrats joust for vital votes in iowa but alas nothing on the republicans _meta_end_dot_

 is the media biased _meta_end_question_

 no they just decide what s important and cover it _meta_end_dot_

 if the public needs to know about something they ll be right on it _meta_end_dot_
