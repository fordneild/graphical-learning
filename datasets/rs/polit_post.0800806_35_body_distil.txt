  i don t deny the obama phenomenon one little bit but it is crazy to think that hillary clinton will soon drop out _meta_end_dot_

 she is already recalibrating her strategy to focus on the february _meta_number_ref_th super tuesday primaries and i am certain that once new hampshire is over and done with yes obama will win the clinton campaign will go massively negative _meta_end_dot_

 there is no way anyone surnamed clinton whose first name is not roger will give up power this easily _meta_end_dot_

 and given that the press would be delighted to write a clinton comeback story if only because the story is compelling i have to think that the groundwork is still there for hillary clinton to make a race of this yet _meta_end_dot_

 maybe i am wrong _meta_end_dot_

 and at the moment it would be easy to argue that i am not only wrong but crazy as well _meta_end_dot_

 but the race for the democratic nomination is anything but over _meta_end_dot_
