  in raising the _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ necessary to start national review magazine in the mid _meta_number_ref_ s william f _meta_end_dot_

 buckley promised prospective investors that his new magazine would recommend policies for the simple reason that we consider them right rather than non controversial and we consider them right because they are based on principles we deem right rather than on popularity polls this was gripping stuff staring at the soviets as the cold war breathed its icy breath across oceans _meta_end_dot_

 it was as buckley would write in nr s founding statement standing athwart history yelling stop at a time when no other is inclined to do so or to have much patience with those who so urge it of course those words were first published on november _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 t was a different world then and i dare say a different magazine _meta_end_dot_

 please read more remember ronald reagan _meta_end_question_

 yup _meta_end_dot_

 t was national review who championed the man who helped to create an intellectual environment in which a hollywood actor could be transformed into a conservative intellect who could not only stand athwart history yelling stop but also gain the political power necessary to make it so _meta_end_dot_

 despite our kids che t shirts communism is no longer fashionable _meta_end_dot_

 revolutions not understood always will be hip to the kiddies but hopefully never brutality and oppression _meta_end_dot_

 when i was in school in the _meta_number_ref_s up at penn state i would walk into grahams at the corner of college and allen every other week to purchase a copy of wfb s magazine _meta_end_dot_

 i later subscribed _meta_end_dot_

 you know it s not the same magazine and grahams has moved up s _meta_end_dot_

 allen street and become a ben jerry s _meta_end_dot_

 did you know that in _meta_number_ref_ nr toyed with their own pre internet online service _meta_end_question_

 it started as a text based service where for a subscription and for additional minute fees one could dial a local number read articles post articles and chat every night with fellow conservatives _meta_end_dot_

 my little known claim to fame i suppose is that i used to hang out in chat with kate o beirne and others a few nights a week _meta_end_dot_

 kate was an assistant to then nr editor ed capano _meta_end_dot_

 i think she said she was a pay grade below jack fowler who before becoming capano s assistant had been an assistant to bill mcgurn in nr s dc bureau the nr online service was called town hall _meta_end_dot_

 it s not what we now know as the dot com _meta_end_dot_

 but i started to see nr drift _meta_end_dot_

 don t get me wrong i adore the insight of folks like byron york ramesh ponnuru and victor david hanson but it s not the magazine i used to buy oh i m old enough to say it in the day it now is that magazine which endorsed mitt romney _meta_end_dot_

 t is said that one teaspoon of a neutron star would weigh about two billion tons on planet earth _meta_end_dot_

 it s packed that densely with matter and i ll venture something similar for bill buckley s prose in the old national review _meta_end_dot_

 it was the stuff of intellectual revolution _meta_end_dot_

 then what i d ask is this _meta_end_question_

 oh put the scales away _meta_end_dot_

 standing athwart the cooling latte and endorsing the guy with the best hair might just be what is to be _meta_number_ref_st century conservatism _meta_end_dot_

 i m still holding out hope that conservatives can push a candidate with a proven record of cutting taxes stopping the insanity of abortion reducing the size and power of government and defending our country s interests _meta_end_dot_

 romney a moderate governor from massachusetts came to conservatism seemingly as the most open route to be elected president _meta_end_dot_

 time will tell if he means what he asserts but we have to wait for time to do the talking _meta_end_dot_

 of course there s always this argument smitten mitten _meta_end_question_

 well it s nro to be sure but it reduces the concerns of a large part of the conservative electorate those uncertain of romney to petty jealousies directed at the candidate s perfection _meta_end_dot_

 it supposes a perfection which some folks just do not see _meta_end_dot_

 and no we re do not need the scales this time either _meta_end_dot_

 it s no teaspoon of matter from a neutron star _meta_end_dot_

 but is it acceptable stuff for the conservative debate _meta_end_question_

 it is certainly not for me to say but i do ask oh why not we have opinions and we express them _meta_end_dot_

 wfb s national review though would have made strong arguments and gone a long way towards helping conservatives towards a consensus _meta_end_dot_

 nr while fine for the time is no longer the conscious of conservatism _meta_end_dot_

 the magazine which once backed ronald reagan has become the mag that endorsed mitt _meta_end_dot_

 but the movement m friends lives on _meta_end_dot_

 as the conservative split in the recent nominating contests makes plain the conscience of conservatism resides within ourselves _meta_end_dot_
