 russert argued that this was a denunciation of george w _meta_end_dot_

 bush mccain countered that it was a criticism and that the president deserves credit for their not having been another attack on the united states since september _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 the biggest mistake the president has made mccain argued is spending _meta_end_dot_

 mccain stood by his vote against the bush tax cuts because there were no spending cuts _meta_end_dot_

 he asserted that under president reagan the tax cuts were accompanied by spending cuts but unfortunately later on we did away with gramm rudman russert read a quote from john mccain published by arizona s tucson citizen newspaper on may _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ in which mccain explains that amnesty had to be a component of any immigration bill _meta_end_dot_

 that being said mccain reiterated that he thinks romney is a good man with a good family russert asked if romney has been consistent in his views mccain answered he has changed his positions on almost every major issue _meta_end_dot_

 that is a fact _meta_end_dot_

 i could chronicle it for you but that doesn t mean he isn t a good person if romney is the nominee mccain said he would of course support him and he would never run as an independent _meta_end_dot_

 mccain pledged to capture osama bin laden _meta_end_dot_

 he promised to improve our human intelligence russert asked him if our intelligence had told him that saddam hussein had no nuclear chemical or biological weapons would he have still voted to go to war _meta_end_dot_

 he blamed not the invasion itself but the mishandling afterwards russert said that there would have been a debate in this country if we had known that saddam hussein did not have if frogs had wings mccain interrupted and he belittled the fruitless navel gazing hypotheticals of waste of time journalists like russert _meta_end_dot_

 no he did not characterize it in that manner russert said that governors carter reagan clinton and bush came to office with no foreign policy experience yet handled the nation s foreign policy just fine _meta_end_dot_

 excuse me he asked mccain why he is saying that romney would be incapable of conducting the nation s foreign policy _meta_end_dot_

 but he credited his lead to his telling the truth as for change mccain took credit for the change in strategy in iraq he called it a change from the rumsfeld strategy to the petraeus strategy _meta_end_dot_

 he guffawed you might want to ask former secretary rumsfeld if i m an agent for change schieffer asked him about romney claiming to be the agent of change _meta_end_dot_

 mccain said that romney has changed his position on a number of issues so he can understand why he would make that claim _meta_end_dot_
