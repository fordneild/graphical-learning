  as predicted barack obama s supporters are beginning to desert his campaign yeah that would be nice but i suppose he can do with these erstwhile obama supporters hamas had previously endorsed obama on new york s wabc radio in april _meta_end_dot_

 read on palestinian presidential advisor saeb erekat said his hangup was over jerusalem _meta_end_dot_

 barry said that a united jerusalem should be the capital of israel _meta_end_dot_

 politically that s an easy one if you want to convince voters who favor israeli existence and security that you re no longer one of the bad guys this loss of an endorsement should not hurt obama as hamas support might help primarily with dem voters who have already had their say in the divided democratic party nominating process _meta_end_dot_

 hamas cannot donate to his campaign what with their being a foreign terrorist organization but please remember bob malley the former obama advisor who also dallied with hamas is no longer technically with the obama campaign but as far as i know zbigniew brzezinski is still there _meta_end_dot_

 both malley and brzezinksi are veterans loosely used term of the clinton and carter administrations respectively _meta_end_dot_

 susan rice is still with obama _meta_end_dot_

 she s the genius who suggested to then nominee dem kerry that he ought to campaign on sending jimmy carter to the mideast to broker peace something which gave the israelis as much pause as it did the dimwitted dem candidate _meta_end_dot_

 obama s aipac speech has evidently convinced somebody from hamas that obama s no longer their guy but with the account on hamas being possibly closed on barry what of the others _meta_end_question_

 i ve not been able to find anything regarding the endorsements of hezbollah or islamic jihad which have never to my knowledge publicly endorsed obama _meta_end_dot_

 perhaps now they will not endorse him sparing him having to repudiate his past in front of aipac _meta_end_dot_
