  everything you do everything you say everywhere you go there s somebody with a tricorder taking it all in _meta_end_dot_

 and then it goes onto youtube _meta_end_dot_

 and then people write about it often with mean spirited titles like obama s sniper tale _meta_end_question_

 when he stood up to detroit s cold shoulder and then it goes on the internet _meta_end_dot_

 not always in that order but it goes out _meta_end_dot_

 you are never off the record _meta_end_dot_

 you are never safely among friends _meta_end_dot_

 you are never able to just assume that something will just slide on by _meta_end_dot_

 and nothing that you do or say will ever go away _meta_end_dot_

 ever _meta_end_dot_

 have a nice day _meta_end_exclamation_
