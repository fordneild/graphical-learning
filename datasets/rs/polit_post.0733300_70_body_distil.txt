  behind the scenes many of us contributors spent our evening watching the youtube debate with our own hard hitting discussion which form of liquor will be the best to recover from such an event i started with some grey goose thinking this would be a lighter affair but once the shindig started went quickly to straight bourbon _meta_end_dot_

 you are welcome to offer your own recommendations in comments _meta_end_dot_

 my own feelings are not much different from erick s huckabee had his best debate when he needed it the most and mccain came across very well in his damn kids on the lawn scalpings _meta_end_dot_

 i think rudy s answers were feast or famine and fred s one liners are a reminder of what a great radio host he ll make when all this is over but that s all _meta_end_dot_

 i am encouraged by the fact that david gergen on cnn and byron york on the corner agree with me about the huckabee thing hey look it s the conventional wisdom already _meta_end_dot_

 and it probably all serves to make a rudy huck ticket more likely _meta_end_dot_

 as for mitt romney both bill bennett and kate o beirne think he did well _meta_end_dot_

 i have a really hard time seeing that _meta_end_dot_

 i think he got the better of the first exchange but seemed to be getting his questions at a bad time either having to echo those who came before or defending his massachusetts record for the umpteenth time throughout the night and i think it was certainly not a helpful night for him _meta_end_dot_

 as for cnn bad start solid middle chunk of questions but they seemed to get curiouser and curiouser as the night went on _meta_end_dot_

 personally i think this format will be more stable next time around when more normal people submit questions and fewer snowmen _meta_end_dot_
