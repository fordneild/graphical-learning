  my what a lovely distraction _meta_end_dot_

 of course it really isn t the most earth shattering news that politicians riff off of one another when they make speeches but the clinton campaign might actually be able to use this to turn away the electorate s attention from hillary clinton s failures on the stump and towards possible plagiarism on the part of barack obama _meta_end_dot_

 the story itself is not the world s biggest deal and i find it bizarre to contemplate that it might last longer than a single news cycle _meta_end_dot_

 but given how well obama is doing currently it stands to reason that some members of the media might want to bring him down a peg while at the same time writing something of a compelling comeback story for hillary clinton _meta_end_dot_

 this is going to be nothing short of bizarre _meta_end_dot_

 and the most bizarre thing about it of course is that even the people who denounce the clintons for bringing this tendentious issue up won t be able to turn away from it _meta_end_dot_
