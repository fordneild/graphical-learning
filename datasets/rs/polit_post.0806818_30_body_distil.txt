  unless you have been living in a cave you know that for about as long as the bush administration has been in office democrats have promised that when they get a chance to run things they will make sure that we are respected loved and admired throughout the world _meta_end_dot_

 of course if you subscribe as i do to the realist theory of international relations you believe that permanent national interests have a great deal more to do with the shape and tenor of international relations than do the identities of a particular head of government and his her advisers _meta_end_dot_

 but never mind that last bit _meta_end_dot_

 let s assume that identity of personnel does a lot more to influence the nature of international relations than i give it credit for _meta_end_dot_

 if that actually is the case then our neighbors have every right to have the dickens scared out of them when they consider what barack obama and hillary clinton might do to america s trade relationships read on _meta_end_dot_

 writing for myself i am of course stunned and amazed that the multilateralist feel good we are the world presidential candidates would actually depart from their longstanding rhetoric and cause our friends to have night terrors concerning the evolution or devolution of our trade policies _meta_end_dot_

 actually i am not _meta_end_dot_

 what really does stun me however is the still evident reluctance the mainstream media has to point out the incongruities between democratic rhetoric and political reality when it comes to this issue _meta_end_dot_

 i mean to be sure things have gotten better on that front there are more people who actually appear to be finding their voices and highlighting the dangers of electing neo protectionists to high political offices _meta_end_dot_

 but the problem and the potential disasters awaiting american trade diplomacy should neo protectionism win out still significantly outweigh the degree of analysis the mainstream media has offered to discuss and educate the public on this matter and condemn those who would ensure that america s trade standing will take a gigantic step back if the upcoming election turns out a certain way _meta_end_dot_
