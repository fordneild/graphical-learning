  obama s ham handed defense of his san francisco remarks last night in which he flagrantly violated the first rule of holes was just one of the nuggets from last night s democratic slugfest in philadelphia worth revisiting _meta_end_dot_

 let s go to the transcript to hand out a few awards _meta_end_dot_

 most glaring historical ignorance gibson gets the award for this question yes charlie gibson managed to pick the very first provision of the constitution to get scrapped because it proved in practice to be a disaster and what s more a disaster in some ways reminiscent of what the democrats face today _meta_end_dot_

 this provision was bad enough when it saddled president john adams with a vice president thomas jefferson who was a vocal critic and leader of the opposition but then it gave us the fiasco of the _meta_number_ref_ election including the _meta_number_ref_th century version of operation chaos read on _meta_end_dot_

 most impartial moderator so along with gibson the debate was moderated by former clinton staffer george stephanopoulos _meta_end_dot_

 what harold ickes wasn t available _meta_end_question_

 chutzpah award to obama for this this is a twofer _meta_end_dot_

 first obama complains about beating a phrase to death despite his own endless and misleading reworking of mccain s _meta_number_ref_ years remark and then he manages to remind people albeit with all sorts of caveats about hillary s notorious baking cookies crack _meta_end_dot_

 what s the word i m looking for here _meta_end_question_

 slick _meta_end_dot_

 the judge a man by his friends award part _meta_number_ref_ hillary tore into obama over the rev _meta_end_dot_

 wright stuff and she kept on hammering obama with more things that your typical ny times reading democratic voter might not have heard about the hot seat award stephanopoulos threw obama a hand grenade with this question d do you think reverend wright loves america as much as you do and followed up again but you do believe he s as patriotic as you are gibson did a fine job running the debate but stephanopoulos got in a few too many of these rabbit punches _meta_end_dot_

 what you believed me _meta_end_question_

 i m a clinton _meta_end_exclamation_

 hillary on bosnia yeah that was not so true _meta_end_dot_

 that must have been that other barack obama guy obama i have never said that i don t wear flag pins or refuse to wear flag pins oh really _meta_end_question_

 the judge a man by his friends award part _meta_number_ref_ hillary took the baton from stephanopoulos on obama s associations with bill ayers formerly of the terrorist group the weather underground in fairness the comments at issue were in a ny times profile published the morning of september _meta_number_ref_ i e they were made before the attacks of that day _meta_end_dot_

 but hey an unrepentant radical terrorist is an unrepentant radical terrorist he didn t need those attacks to tell which way the wind was blowing _meta_end_dot_

 great moments in moral equivalence obama s response on ayers _meta_end_question_

 yeah obama will win a lot of friends by equating pro lifers with terrorists _meta_end_dot_

 as adam notes sen _meta_end_dot_

 coburn ran for office and is trying to change the law without making any violent actions _meta_end_dot_

 william ayers tried to kill innocent people to make a political point now this means war obama didn t forget that he s not the only one with a soft spot for leftist radicals that was just a great comeback in all seriousness _meta_end_dot_

 of course it won t be of much use against mccain _meta_end_dot_

 i m all outta wiggle room hillary s been trying out straddles on iraq for a long time despite having never backed off her original support for the war but she s going all in for the democratic nomination now where will this lead _meta_end_question_

 we don t know what will happen as we withdraw best one liner by someone not at the debate mccain on video jim geraghty noted hillary laughing at this line _meta_end_dot_

 read my lips award after hillary promised to jack up the top income tax rates the latter isn t even remotely consistent with obama s many tax hike schemes and big spending plans but we can certainly hold him to the pledge _meta_end_dot_

 taxes aren t for revenue after all i loved this exchange in which obama basically admitted that he was looking to raise the capital gains tax for punitive purposes even if it didn t produce more revenue hillary to her credit was at least willing to put som e limits on how much she would raise the capital gains tax of course you pay capital gains taxes regardless of your income many retirees have more capital gains than income so we are already disregarding the stuff they were just saying about not raising taxes on people at various income levels _meta_end_dot_

 ah it was fun while it lasted _meta_end_dot_

 kinda like bill clinton s _meta_number_ref_ campaign promise of a middle class tax cut which he then threw overboard although as noted he did finally cut the capital gains tax five years into his tenure _meta_end_dot_

 money that s what i want oh and tax hikes _meta_end_question_

 we weren t done with tax hikes unexpected love for dick cheney award obama hey some love for the days when dick cheney was defense secretary _meta_end_exclamation_

 woohoo _meta_end_exclamation_

 h t via glenn _meta_end_dot_

 there was more interesting stuff on foreign policy guns and affirmative action as well _meta_end_dot_
