  several worrisome trends in the chinese economy that have been in place for nearly a year and a half are charging ahead with no end in sight _meta_end_dot_

 here s a news story about it _meta_end_dot_

 in a word inflation _meta_end_dot_

 china simply has too much money and not enough economy _meta_end_dot_

 that s putting tremendous strain on the government which controls the economy tightly _meta_end_dot_

 and it s opening up big questions about whether the country can continue its historically unprecedented rate of change _meta_end_dot_

 more the sheer numbers here are astounding _meta_end_dot_

 china now holds nearly _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ trillion in foreign reserves _meta_end_dot_

 it was only the beginning of last year that we were all remarking that they had reached a trillion _meta_end_dot_

 we don t really know how big china s economy is _meta_end_dot_

 they say it s around _meta_dollor_ref_ trillion making them the world s fourth largest _meta_end_dot_

 it s far more likely to be around _meta_number_ref_ or _meta_number_ref_ trillion making them number two _meta_end_dot_

 let s say it s the latter _meta_end_dot_

 for them to be sitting on _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ trillion in foreign exchange would be like us holding close to _meta_dollor_ref_ trillion worth of yen and euros in cash _meta_end_dot_

 it s just crazy _meta_end_dot_

 where does all of that foreign exchange come from _meta_end_question_

 well when you and the europeans buy stuff from china their exporters receive dollars and euros _meta_end_dot_

 the people s bank of china their central bank requires all exporters to turn over their foreign currency revenues in exchange for yuan _meta_end_dot_

 chinese people aren t permitted to hold foreign currency balances just as it does with oil based economies all of this trade based inflow generates inflationary pressure _meta_end_dot_

 china exacerbates the problem by artificially undervaluing the yuan which is allowed to change its value relative to the us dollar in tiny increments every day _meta_end_dot_

 this morning the yuan is trading at just under _meta_number_ref_ to the dollar up from nearly _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ about a year ago _meta_end_dot_

 but the dollar has been falling against the euro which accelerates the yuan s undervaluation against the euro _meta_end_dot_

 china s trade deficit with the eurozone is about the size of ours _meta_end_dot_

 in fact it may now be bigger _meta_end_dot_

 so broad measures of inflation in china are showing prices about _meta_number_ref_ _meta_percent_ref_ higher than a year ago _meta_end_dot_

 some food and grain prices are nearly _meta_percent_ref_ higher than a year ago _meta_end_dot_

 that s not a typo _meta_end_dot_

 what have they been doing to cool their economy down _meta_end_question_

 they raised policy interest rates half a dozen times last year _meta_end_dot_

 their benchmark is a one year rate that now stands at _meta_number_ref_ _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 no one has ever explained to me why china always makes their interest rates a multiple of _meta_number_ref_ basis points _meta_end_dot_

 maybe _meta_number_ref_ is a lucky money number a similar dated us treasury security yields a bit more than two percent _meta_end_dot_

 i couldn t tell you whether the chinese benchmark rate is actually a government bill rate an interbank lending rate or a prime rate _meta_end_dot_

 still what about raising lending rates further as a way to reduce inflation _meta_end_question_

 there are limits to that because it tends to attract foreign capital looking for the highest yield on any given day adjusted for exchange rate risk _meta_end_dot_

 these speculative yield seeking inflows are called hot money and they deeply frighten the chinese _meta_end_dot_

 hot money can and will change direction overnight and an economy which comes to depend on it can crash when it decides to go somewhere else _meta_end_dot_

 this effect originating in thailand was what caused the asian flu financial crisis of _meta_number_ref_ which devastated the economies once known as the four tigers but barely scraped china _meta_end_dot_

 they still remember the lesson _meta_end_dot_

 so they ve refrained from raising rates so far this year and they ve slowed down the rate at which the yuan appreciates against other currencies _meta_end_dot_

 that leaves then with increasing bank reserve requirements as a policy tool _meta_end_dot_

 and they just raised them again to _meta_number_ref_ _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 comparable reserve requirements in the us and europe range anywhere from _meta_percent_ref_ or less to around _meta_percent_ref_ depending on the type of institution people are saying that china s bank reserve requirement will hit _meta_percent_ref_ by year end _meta_end_dot_

 this has the effect of freezing money out of the economy since it can t be loaned out _meta_end_dot_

 with a strategy like that you expect that the bankers will start howling because their profits will fall _meta_end_dot_

 but chinese bank profits are as strong as ever which implies that the increased reserve requirements aren t really cooling the economy down _meta_end_dot_

 they re also putting money into what is probably the world s largest sovereign wealth fund swf _meta_end_dot_

 this is a vehicle for sterilizing capital inflows by investing them in other countries under government control _meta_end_dot_

 to my knowledge china s swf now has about _meta_dollor_ref_ billion which is about the same size as their holdings of us treasury bonds _meta_end_dot_

 china could go out and plow a trillion dollars or more into assets all around the world _meta_end_dot_

 but here they would quickly run into political limits _meta_end_dot_

 it would be awfully hard to contain the ruckus if they suddenly start buying up public equity here in the us _meta_end_dot_

 china is rapidly becoming a society full of very wealthy people _meta_end_dot_

 but they have an income inequality problem that is vastly worse than the one we have _meta_end_dot_

 and the environmental degradation throughout the country is rapidly becoming a world class crisis as industrial development proceeds at all costs _meta_end_dot_

 china is on an unsustainable path _meta_end_dot_

 inflation simply can t keep going at its current pace without causing some major disruptions _meta_end_dot_

 the problem is that chinese society is very fragile _meta_end_dot_

 inflation is causing economic distress now as china s non wealthy people find it harder and harder to buy food and fuel prices of both are controlled which of course results in shortages _meta_end_dot_

 and their attempts to cool inflation if successful will result in different stresses possibly including a major spike in unemployment as investments go bad all over the country _meta_end_dot_

 china s society is controlled from the top down _meta_end_dot_

 they don t have reserves of economic strength embedded at all levels of society like we do _meta_end_dot_

 by coming as far as they have in such a short time they may find that an economic slump will put a lot more stress on social cohesion among their elites than they can easily handle _meta_end_dot_

 on the other hand if they don t get a grip on inflation they might end up with another tiananmen square _meta_end_dot_
