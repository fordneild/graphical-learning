  a week from tomorrow texas will either prolong the bloody battle for the democratic nomination or give the nomination to a self admitted former cokehead _meta_end_dot_

 either way we should thank texas _meta_end_dot_

 let s presume if we will that texas goes for barack hussein obama a name that is not quite poll tested and mother approved _meta_end_dot_

 that presumption is not a safe one because even now the forces of clinton are going into hispanic communities and churches to remind them that hispanics would be minority number one in a clinton administration and minority number three in an obama administration behind blacks and everybody else _meta_end_dot_

 with thirty percent of the voting strength in the texas democratic primary hispanics could help hillary pull it off _meta_end_dot_

 in any event i presume obama will win _meta_end_dot_

 and we should delight in his victory _meta_end_dot_

 hillary has been too timid to throw a punch _meta_end_dot_

 we will not be _meta_end_dot_

 we will remind people that obama admitted using cocaine _meta_end_dot_

 while the left loves to accuse george bush of doing the same one of these two men wrote a book and admitted he did so _meta_end_dot_

 and that man s name is not bush _meta_end_dot_

 we will point out that when obama was in the illinois senate he voted to allow porn shops to open within _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ feet of churches and elementary schools _meta_end_dot_

 likewise obama voted against trying high school students as adults if they committed gun crimes on school grounds i m sure the folks in colorado will love that vote _meta_end_dot_

 obama says he only wants gun owners to be able to use their guns for sport and he has a record to prove it _meta_end_dot_

 obama supported allowing criminals to sue their victims if their victims shot them _meta_end_dot_

 crucially for those pro life voters who right now seem to be fawning over obama we ll remind them that he is to the left of hillary on abortion going so far as to oppose the born alive infant protection act _meta_end_dot_

 for years the democrats have tried to get away from the anti gun big government high tax abortion on demand liberal label _meta_end_dot_

 they ve gone so far as to rebrand themselves progressive _meta_end_dot_

 obama champions the failed schemes of the last one hundred years repeatedly rejected by the voters to fix what he claims are the failed policies of the last eight years _meta_end_dot_

 the democrats god bless em are about to hand us the prototypical liberal boogeyman as their nominee _meta_end_dot_

 by the time it s all over the only defense obama is going to have is to resort to the standard liberal playbook and scream racism when anyone dares point out his voting record _meta_end_dot_

 and the public we have not heard from year the public that swings elections but generally does not engage in primaries are going to come running to john mccain begging him to save the nation from the liberal anti gun former cokehead whose feminist wife hates america _meta_end_dot_

 america has rejected liberalism _meta_end_dot_

 obama thinks he can repackage it in new rhetoric and move it to the left of hillary _meta_end_dot_

 he cannot _meta_end_dot_

 i relish the fight against the man who has no problem with porn shops across the street from elementary schools and terrorist leaders in the white house _meta_end_dot_

 that ll go over real well _meta_end_dot_

 the only thing better than an obama candidacy is a hillary one after a bloody primary fight _meta_end_dot_

 as a result god bless texas _meta_end_dot_
