  today the united states house of representatives scored a big victory for the people of israel _meta_end_dot_

 my resolution h res _meta_number_ref_ had the overwhelming support of over _meta_number_ref_ bipartisan cosponsors and passed the house floor with a vote of _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 this resolution condemns the ongoing hamas orchestrated terrorist attacks on israeli civilian communities _meta_end_dot_

 h _meta_end_dot_

 res _meta_number_ref_ calls for president bush to direct the united states permanent representative to the united nations to introduce a resolution within the un security council condemning palestinian rocket attacks against innocent israel civilians _meta_end_dot_

 it also asks that u s _meta_end_dot_

 allies in the middle east officially and publicly condemn these attacks and other terrorist actions against israel _meta_end_dot_

 i am pleased that congress stood up for the people of israel by sending a message to terrorists and those countries that aid them _meta_end_dot_

 rocket attacks and intentional violence against innocent civilians will not be tolerated _meta_end_dot_

 israeli communities like sderot and ashkelon have sustained egregious damages and citizens have suffered from serious injuries and even fatalities _meta_end_dot_

 often times palestinians who do not support violence are victims of the crossfire _meta_end_dot_

 it is time that the brutality comes to an end _meta_end_dot_

 passing this resolution is a stepping stone to helping end the aggressive acts of palestinian terrorist and ensuring innocent civilians in israel live together peacefully _meta_end_dot_

 violent palestinian groups and terrorist organizations must be held accountable for their horrific acts _meta_end_dot_

 organizations like hamas the islamic jihad and the popular resistance committees prc need to understand that when they attack the people of israel the united states and other countries will not remain silent _meta_end_dot_

 unjust actions must not go unpunished _meta_end_dot_

 rest assured that i will continue to ensure that islamic radicals are held responsible for launching these attacks and that countries like iran egypt and syria which support terrorists are also held accountable _meta_end_dot_

 too many countries foster violence and thereby hinder the peace process in the region _meta_end_dot_

 i will continue this fight until the global community joins the u s in condemning terrorism and its violent acts _meta_end_dot_
