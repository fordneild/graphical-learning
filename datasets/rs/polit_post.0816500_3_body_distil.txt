  i think deep down quite a few of us all liked howard dean insofar that his rhetoric was over the top funny and his instincts were well yeaaarrrrgh and as rush limbaugh reports howard knows the score so far _meta_end_dot_

 spake limbaugh into his golden eib microphone on wednesday obama s nervous as evidenced by the fact that he is moving howie and the party apparatus from dc to chicago _meta_end_dot_

 ben smith at politico com tells us read on smith further reports that dems familiar with the obama plan report further that obama s pulling people from howie s _meta_number_ref_ state program and putting them to work in electorally competitive states _meta_end_dot_

 it is barry s national strategy and he has been forced to do it by his own unpopularity in spots which is itself driving elements of his party away from his effort _meta_end_dot_

 it makes sense really for barry to move his dnc to chicago _meta_end_dot_

 bring it home closer to political allies like ayers and wright rezko and pflager _meta_end_dot_

 and obama s kingmaker the machine made d _meta_end_dot_

 emil jones _meta_end_dot_

 it is the site of the invigorating and exciting democratic national convention of _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_exclamation_

 it looks like that one won t repeated itself in denver this year as hillary has suggested that she might not contest this nomination to the end _meta_end_dot_

 but as things become increasingly more untenable for team barry hillary s kept her delegates and can act if she must team barry and their party apparatus seem to be ascared and adrift wondering when the school nay _meta_end_exclamation_

 the phalanx of humboldt squid will attack from the depths latch their suckers onto the suckers and chew them up with nasty little teeth _meta_end_dot_

 so howard dean is going to illinois _meta_end_question_

 yeaaarrrrgh _meta_end_exclamation_
