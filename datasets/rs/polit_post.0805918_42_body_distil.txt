 sen _meta_end_dot_

 john mccain r ariz said he favors demint s amendment and he promised to lobby his fellow senate republicans to get behind the effort _meta_end_dot_

 i absolutely would support such an amendment and abolish earmarks altogether mccain told conservative bloggers on a conference call this afternoon _meta_end_dot_

 as i ve said i will veto any earmark project that comes across my desk demint will offer the one year earmark moratorium as an amendment to the democrats budget proposal in two weeks when the senate takes up debate on the floor _meta_end_dot_

 his schedule permitting mccain said he would make the trip to washington to vote for the measure _meta_end_dot_

 i really can t tell you traveling and campaigning now for many months how dispirited the bridge to nowhere or earmark and pork barrel spending was to our republican base he said _meta_end_dot_

 we lost in _meta_number_ref_ not because of iraq but because spending got out of control last year democrats passed nearly _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ earmarks costing more than _meta_dollor_ref_ billion figures that far surpassed totals from a year earlier _meta_end_dot_

 the democrats broken promises to clean up the earmarking process prompted house republicans to endorse a one year moratorium _meta_end_dot_

 while senate gop leaders haven t gone as far as their house counterparts demint said the only way to fix the system is to quit cold turkey _meta_end_dot_

 in order to do so he needs all republicans on board _meta_end_dot_
