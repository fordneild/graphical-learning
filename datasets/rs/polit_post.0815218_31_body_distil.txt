  the democratic party s rules and bylaws committee will meet today to undo the party s disenfranchisement of florida s and michigan s democrats _meta_end_dot_

 now that obama leads hillary by about _meta_number_ref_ delegates the rules and bylaws committee is likely to compromise and following the republican party s example the democrats should have adopted last year agree to seat half of the florida and michigan delegates _meta_end_dot_

 hillary is pushing hard to seat all the delegates fight all the way to the democrat s national convention
