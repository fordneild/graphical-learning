  whatever else happens during the course of this election cycle we have already won one victory _meta_end_dot_

 and by we i mean all of us here it is the clintons have been sidelined from the fast track to power _meta_end_dot_

 i write this knowing that barack obama will make a significantly tougher opponent against john mccain than will hillary clinton _meta_end_dot_

 yes i know of the demographic suppositions that state that hillary would have been the stronger democratic nominee given her wider appeal in the midwest and in some of the southern states _meta_end_dot_

 i don t buy it though _meta_end_dot_

 as the primary and caucus season has shown the clintons campaign machine has a propensity to sputter and halt in all of the wrong places _meta_end_dot_

 they go through money like most people go through socks _meta_end_dot_

 the campaign staff is disorganized and dysfunctional in its intra staff relations _meta_end_dot_

 and the candidate herself is flawed _meta_end_dot_

 she is flawed because she campaigns not for some great cause but for herself _meta_end_dot_

 just herself _meta_end_dot_

 only herself _meta_end_dot_

 sure she has her policy interests health care being the most prominent example but at the end of the day hillary clinton was is and always shall be in politics for hillary clinton alone _meta_end_dot_

 power is her central organizing principle and always has been _meta_end_dot_

 she came into the race as the inevitable nominee and was determined to run her campaign as if it was a coronation _meta_end_dot_

 she was clearly shocked outraged and offended that barack obama in his upstart way elbowed her aside and captured the prize she had lusted after for so long _meta_end_dot_

 of course at the end of the day it should surprise no one that obama was able to win the democratic nomination instead of hillary _meta_end_dot_

 he had a far better organization than she did and the people in his organization both understood the rules surrounding the democratic presidential nomination process better than hillary s team did and was filled with fewer prima donnas thus ensuring that the focus would always remain on obama rather than on any drama within his staff structure _meta_end_dot_

 meanwhile the clinton campaign was subsumed in ignorance surrounding the nomination process couldn t use the fundraising structure of the democratic party or the internet nearly as well to stay competitive financially and regularly drowned out clinton s message with stories of fights between harold ickes and mark penn harold ickes and patti solis doyle mark penn and patti solis doyle bill clinton and everybody on the planet and _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 well you get the picture _meta_end_dot_

 obama s hope and change campaign message is a shallow and empty one when examined closely _meta_end_dot_

 but credit where it is due it is a message _meta_end_dot_

 what was hillary clinton s message _meta_end_question_

 elect me because i was a first lady and it would be really really cool if a former first lady could be elected as the first female president of the united states when it became clear that this approach was _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 er _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 less than optimal she tried on various different personae the fighter the populist the woman who survived sniper fire at the airport in tuzla none of these approaches worked because they were so transparently fake and some were even faker than others _meta_end_dot_

 voters not being stupid saw through the whole charade _meta_end_dot_

 the rest is history _meta_end_dot_

 read on _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 how very satisfying all of this is _meta_end_dot_

 the clintons have always been venal power grubbing status hungry and utterly and completely selfish in being willing to put their interests and whatever drama they have been involved in before the interests of others and before the country s interests as well _meta_end_dot_

 never did this become so clear as in the just concluded fight for the democratic presidential nomination though to be sure it should have been made clear long ago _meta_end_dot_

 was any of the behavior exhibited by the clintons any different than what we saw in the _meta_number_ref_s _meta_end_question_

 didn t we have enough back then of their serial willingness eagerness even to vault themselves over and above all other people and all other causes _meta_end_question_

 we got put through the muck of whitewater the crassness of cattle futures the slime of the fbi file transfer and impeachment all because the clintons believed that the dignity of the country was nowhere near as important as their own personal interests _meta_end_dot_

 they carried this behavior into the fight for the democratic presidential nomination and now likely have the gall to be shocked that the country has made it clear it has had enough of them _meta_end_dot_

 of course there are many of us who told all the rest of you so _meta_end_dot_

 we were called the vast right wing conspiracy but if anything has been made clear during the course of this democratic nomination fight it was that its story should be titled maybe the vast right wing conspiracy had a point in their desperate attempt to regain and reacquire power the clintons clearly explicitly and shamelessly exploited racial issues to try to drag barack obama down to their level _meta_end_dot_

 democratic partisans professed to be shocked shocked by this behavior but the only people who weren t surprised were the very vast right wing conspiracy members who kept trying to tell the na ve and credulous that this is what the clintons are like _meta_end_dot_

 this is what the clintons have always been like _meta_end_dot_

 this is what the clintons always will be like _meta_end_dot_

 nothing and no one is more important than they are as far as they are concerned _meta_end_dot_

 their collective egotism and their willingness to rip asunder and destroy anything and everyone in their way is as appalling as it is constant _meta_end_dot_

 and that of course is why i was not in the least bit surprised when i read this _meta_end_dot_

 i know that the piece relies heavily on anonymous sources but does anyone actually believe anymore that bill clinton doesn t fit the profile todd purdum drew up for him _meta_end_question_

 i mean doesn t the entire story read a little bit familiarly for all of us who remember the kind of character flaws and deficiencies the former president brought into the oval office and into our public life _meta_end_question_

 does anyone really believe he has changed _meta_end_question_

 the only change that i appear to see is an increased willingness on the part of bill clinton to yell scream and insult those who don t buy into his line a population that now includes most sentient human beings must suck that the former boy wonder no longer gets his way and has now been reduced to the role of angry old man _meta_end_dot_

 but then some people have serious problems accepting when their time is past don t they _meta_end_question_

 the only thing regretful about the clintons departure from center stage as i alluded to at the beginning of this piece is that barack obama will present john mccain with a significantly tougher race for the presidency _meta_end_dot_

 and yes it would have been tremendously satisfying for republicans to be able to have beaten the clintons in the general election _meta_end_dot_

 but gift horses should not be looked in the mouth _meta_end_dot_

 for far too long the clintons have poisoned our public discourse and even their former democratic allies now understand at least one hopes that clintons really were and are as bad as their critics made them out to be _meta_end_dot_

 good riddance to them _meta_end_dot_

 as a nation we always deserved better _meta_end_dot_

 and at long last we realized it _meta_end_dot_
