  every once in a while i am more thankful than ever for today s technology which allows me to talk to you directly instead of having to go through the filter of the main stream media _meta_end_dot_

 some of them are intent on making the outcome of the campaign dependent upon their pre conceived notions _meta_end_dot_

 every once in a while their incomplete and slanted coverage makes this clear _meta_end_dot_

 today i had this story written about me regarding what i said at a town hall event in burlington iowa by a reporter who wasn t even at the event _meta_end_dot_

 incidentally i declined to be interviewed by this particular reporter yesterday for reasons which will soon be apparent _meta_end_dot_

 in referring to me she reported he doesn t like modern campaigning isn t interested in running for president and will not be devastated if he doesn t win _meta_end_dot_

 below is a transcript of what i actually said in response to a question by a local burlington resident which was the basis of the reporter s story _meta_end_dot_

 it is clear that there are those in the media who will exact a high price for candor and from those whom they consider to be insufficiently ambitious _meta_end_dot_

 but it is with increasing amazement that we see that those who are willing to slant or leave out important parts of a story to make their point _meta_end_dot_

 if a candidate succumbs to this he will be reduced to nothing more than a sound bite machine _meta_end_dot_

 as for me i am going to continue to say exactly what is in my heart and is on my mind and give straight and honest answers to those who ask straight and honest questions _meta_end_dot_

 incidentally the audience in burlington broke into applause in the middle of my answer _meta_end_dot_

 the reporter wouldn t know that because she wasn t even there _meta_end_dot_

 the transcript is below the fold _meta_end_dot_

 q courtesy abc news my only problem with you and why i haven t thrown all my support behind you is that i don t know if you have the desire to be president _meta_end_dot_

 if i caucus for you next week are you still going to be there two months from now _meta_end_question_

 that is a very good question not because it s difficult to answer but i m gonna answer it in a little different way than what you might expect _meta_end_dot_

 in the first place i got into the race about the time people normally get into get into it _meta_end_dot_

 the fact of the matter is people get into it a lot earlier than they used to _meta_end_dot_

 for some of them they were juniors in high school _meta_end_dot_

 the first place i wouldn t be here if i didn t _meta_end_dot_

 i wouldn t be doing this _meta_end_dot_

 i grew up in very modest circumstances _meta_end_dot_

 i left government and i and my family have made sacrifices to be sitting here today _meta_end_dot_

 i haven t had any income for a long time because i figured to be clean you ve got to cut everything off _meta_end_dot_

 i was doing speaking engagements and i had a contract to do a tv show _meta_end_dot_

 i had a contract with abc radio and so forth _meta_end_dot_

 a man would have to be a total fool to do all those things and to be leaving his family which is not a joyful thing if he didn t want to do it _meta_end_dot_

 i am not consumed by personal ambition _meta_end_dot_

 i will not be devastated if i don t do it _meta_end_dot_

 i want the people to have the best president they can have _meta_end_dot_

 when this talk first originated from people around the country both directly and through polls liked the idea of me stepping up and of course you always look better form a distance _meta_end_dot_

 but most of those people are still there _meta_end_dot_

 i approached it from the standpoint of a deal _meta_end_dot_

 a kind of a marriage _meta_end_dot_

 if one side of a marriage really has to be talked into the marriage it probably ain t going to be a good deal _meta_end_dot_

 but if you mutually decide it s going to be a good thing _meta_end_dot_

 in this case if you think this is a good thing for the country then we have an opportunity to do some wonderful things together _meta_end_dot_

 i m offering myself up _meta_end_dot_

 i m saying that i have the background the capability and concern to do this and do it for the right reasons _meta_end_dot_

 i m not particularly interested in running for president but i think i d make a good president _meta_end_dot_

 nowadays the process has become much more important than it used to be _meta_end_dot_

 i don t know that they ever asked george washington a question like this _meta_end_dot_

 i don t know that they ever asked dwight d _meta_end_dot_

 eisenhower a question like this _meta_end_dot_

 but nowadays it s all about fire in the belly _meta_end_dot_

 i m not sure in the world we live in today it s a good thing if a president has too much fire in the belly _meta_end_dot_

 i approach life differently than a lot of people _meta_end_dot_

 people i guess wonder how i ve been as successful as i ve been in everything that i ve done _meta_end_dot_

 i won two races in tn by _meta_number_ref_ point margins in a state that bill clinton carried twice _meta_end_dot_

 i ve never had an acting lesson _meta_end_dot_

 i guess that s obvious by people who ve watched me when i did it i did it _meta_end_dot_

 wasn t just a lark _meta_end_dot_

 anything that s worth doing is worth doing well _meta_end_dot_

 but i ve always been a little more laid back than most _meta_end_dot_

 i m only consumed by very very few things _meta_end_dot_

 politics is not one of them _meta_end_dot_

 the welfare of our country and our kids and grandkids is one of them _meta_end_dot_

 if people really want in their president super type a personality someone who has gotten up every morning and gone to bed every night and been thinking about for years how they win the presidency of the united states someone who can look you straight in the eye and say they enjoy every minute of campaigning i ain t that guy _meta_end_dot_

 so i hope i ve discussed that and didn t talk you out of anything _meta_end_dot_

 i honestly want i can t imagine a worse set of circumstances than achieving the presidency of the united states under false pretenses _meta_end_dot_

 i go out of my way to be myself _meta_end_dot_
