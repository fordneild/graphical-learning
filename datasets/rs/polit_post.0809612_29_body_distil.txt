  blackwater worldwide headquartered in moyock north carolina will have it s contract renewed for another year to provide bodyguards and armed drivers for diplomats whenever they leave the so called green zone where the us embassy is based folks may recall that blackwater was charged with the killing of innocent civilians in iraq on september _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 the fbi hasn t finished their investigation so the contract renewal will proceed _meta_end_dot_

 whether they did in fact kill innocent civilians or truly felt they were under attack and attempted to defend themselves in good faith i ll leave to the fbi to sort out _meta_end_dot_

 there is something more specific about the news of another year long security agreement between the state department and blackwater that deserves a closer look _meta_end_dot_

 more below the fold _meta_end_dot_

 blackwater like halliburton and thousands of other independent contractors in iraq serves two masters _meta_end_dot_

 the first is the work they do that others won t do in a war zone _meta_end_dot_

 the second is the campaign fodder they provide democrats seeking to improve their standing in the polls on the backs of others _meta_end_dot_

 unhappy with the pace or outcome of the fbi investigation into the charges against blackwater last fall apparently waxman sees a chance to circumvent the whole matter of the fbi s investigation in to the matter of the iraqi civilian deaths by dragging the irs into it or inject himself in to the issue in the name of good democrat theater _meta_end_dot_

 of course there s plenty more gnashing of teeth and cries of all things black helicopter and conspiracy but a lot of this is to be expected making something up when the facts are unavailable or inconsistent with the agenda is standard fare during political seasons _meta_end_dot_

 while al jaz and the uae media and our own home bred anti success media will continue to suggest blackwater and many other contractors in iraq doing the dirty work others won t do is bad they ll still be hugging their bodyguards and armed drivers every time they bring them back safely into the green zone after a photo op showing how bad things are there _meta_end_dot_

 for another year at least _meta_end_dot_
