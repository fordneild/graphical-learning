  mccain adviser ousted in conflict uproar reads the politico headline _meta_end_dot_

 that may make for a great headline but neither it nor the sensationalism in the story are accurate _meta_end_dot_

 craig shirley a friend who helps redstate with pr work hey they should have mentioned us too has done work with stop her now that our own kevin holtsberry is involved in _meta_end_dot_

 the obama campaign no doubt pushed this story on the politico which as an organization seems more susceptible than any other media organization save the new york times for candidate generated stories and the politico gladly went with the sensationalism _meta_end_dot_

 actually craig was asked by the mccain campaign if he wanted to continue working with the campaign or with stop him now _meta_end_dot_

 craig chose not the campaign _meta_end_dot_

 likewise stop him now is not one of those shadowy _meta_number_ref_ organizations but an internet website that fec regulations do not apply to _meta_end_dot_

 stop her now was a _meta_number_ref_ but certainly not shadowy _meta_end_dot_

 it only existed on the net and largely went unnoticed by the press until the guns turned on jesus obama _meta_end_dot_

 add this to the politico file _meta_end_dot_

 oh and pay attention little lefties redstate craig shirley stop him now kevin holtsberry redstate what a web we weave _meta_end_dot_
