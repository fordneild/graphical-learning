  obama s family history real or imagined has been the subject of some discussion _meta_end_dot_

 earlier today i posted on the subject and made as it turns out the gross error of quoting talkleft now i m placed in the awkward position of coming to the defense of barack obama _meta_end_dot_

 talkleft relying on a transcribed world war ii veterans index gets it wrong _meta_end_dot_

 according to world war ii army enlistment records available free at ancestry com no i don t own stock obama s grandfather stanley a dunham enlisted on _meta_number_ref_ january _meta_number_ref_ not _meta_number_ref_ june _meta_end_dot_

 so while he might not have enlisted the day after pearl harbor he did enlist after the holidays i can t say that i blame him either _meta_end_dot_

 on the other hand the same record set shows that no charles w payne or permutation thereof entered the army from kansas up until _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 and of course another problem is that stanley dunham does not appear on the roster of _meta_number_ref_th infantry division _meta_end_dot_
