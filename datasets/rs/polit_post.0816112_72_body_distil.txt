  earlier i introduced jim johnson the head of barack obama s vice presidential search team _meta_end_dot_

 he is also a lobbyist operative for jimmy carter and walter mondale is this the change we need representative of a former head of state bundler for the obama campaign and disgraced mortgage executive who mistated fannie mae profits to get a bigger bonus _meta_end_dot_

 oh yeah _meta_end_dot_

 today the ny sun tells us that he also got sweetheart mortgages from bankrupt legally not merely in other ways mortgage dealer country wide financial but i am sure that barack obama sees nothing wrong with that _meta_end_dot_

 after all he got a subsidy on his own house from now felon then fbi investigation target tony rezko _meta_end_dot_

 so next time barack obama complains about the housing crisis ask him about his vice presidential search guy who gets sweetheart deals _meta_end_dot_

 or even about his own sweetheart deals _meta_end_dot_

 he hasn t answered enough questions there only like eight questions we agree with the chicago sun times that that is not enough _meta_end_dot_
