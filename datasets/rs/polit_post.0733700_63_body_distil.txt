  i should not bring this back up _meta_end_dot_

 those of us who dared to suggest anything along these lines were successfully berated across the internet and in our inboxes for daring to do so _meta_end_dot_

 but i m going to do so anyway and i ll just steel myself for all the criticism that s going to come my way for daring to make what i consider increasingly obvious points _meta_end_dot_

 let s return to the push poll against mitt romney _meta_end_dot_

 i posited and under sustained yelling in my inbox backed down from a theory over thanksgiving that this poll was a legitimate poll ascertaining whether or not mitt romney s faith was the reason he had apparently reached a ceiling of support in new hampshire and iowa _meta_end_dot_

 i called it my crazy theory even though it didn t sound so crazy to me _meta_end_dot_

 i ve run races for ten years _meta_end_dot_

 were i running a race and my candidate had the looks the bio the issue positions and money that romney had and yet had hit a ceiling in support i d run a poll to probe people on why that ceiling was there _meta_end_dot_

 and i d push people on the taboo polling subjects those prejudices and subjects about which you might even lie about to a pollster in an anonymous poll _meta_end_dot_

 one of those subjects would be faith and whether voters might actually be discriminating against my candidate because he is a mormon _meta_end_dot_

 and so the questions that got asked just might seem like a push poll to some people _meta_end_dot_

 in fact it may seem very much like a push poll to a lot of people if i were rooting out latent biases people have against my candidate because of his faith _meta_end_dot_

 how many people bought into the legends and rumors of my candidate s frequently misreported on faith would be a compelling and useful data point when i began my targeting and providing evidence to my candidate that he needed to take a course of action _meta_end_dot_

 i bring this all back up because three weeks after the stories of this polling surfaced we discover tonight that mitt romney is finally going to give that speech on faith that robert novak and others have been writing about for months and months _meta_end_dot_

 three weeks after the data points could be processed in the poll mitt romney will travel to texas like prominent candidates do when they want to give a speech on religion see e g _meta_end_dot_

 john f _meta_end_dot_

 kennedy and rudy giuliani and address his faith _meta_end_dot_

 it could be that the romney camp feels it needs to address this issue in light of the mini brouhaha over muslims in his cabinet this past week _meta_end_dot_

 it could be that realizing a dirty trickster was push polling to beat him up on his faith romney decided it was time _meta_end_dot_

 i hold now to the position that a lot of the reporters i ve talked to on this subject hold and on which by stating here solely as my personal opinion i expect to be excoriated by a lot of people even some who probably privately think i might be right the push poll was pushing people on matters of religious bias but it was not done by a camp hostile to mitt romney _meta_end_dot_

 and the results of that polling gave the romeny camp all the data points needed to finally show their mba grad of a candidate that there is a real need for the speech he is about to give _meta_end_dot_

 i could be wrong and god knows the romney camp has been telling me since i first suggested it that i m wrong _meta_end_dot_

 but i think i m right _meta_end_dot_
