  i m against this the deal is primarily being driven on the republican side by senate republican leader mitch mcconnell whose plan would give the military _meta_dollor_ref_ billion of funding more than the democrats proposal of _meta_dollor_ref_ billion but less than the white house s desired _meta_dollor_ref_ billion _meta_end_dot_

 i think that congressional democrats are under more pressure to pass an appropriations bill that gives american troops the support and funding that they need than the administration is to approve _meta_dollor_ref_ billion more in domestic spending than they have called for _meta_end_dot_

 the president should work to ensure that republicans did not sign on to this plan and that a clean funding bill one independent of the _meta_dollor_ref_ billion in extra spending was passed _meta_end_dot_

 and if you read further in the story you will find that the house republican leadership is urging the president to do just that _meta_end_dot_
