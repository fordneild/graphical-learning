  although he seems prepared to wrap up the democratic presidential nomination eventually at any rate barack obama still has a ways to go before he fully unites his party _meta_end_dot_

 a significant segment of it believes that obama is much too eager to go a taxing if he should get elected president _meta_end_dot_

 and yes i know this comes from the clinton wing of the democratic party but those people vote too you know _meta_end_dot_

 at a time when the obama campaign worries rightly so that they may not be able to capture the votes of the clinton contingent when the general election finally rolls around about the worst thing team obama can do is give the clintonites valid and legitimate policy excuses to consider sitting on their hands in november _meta_end_dot_
