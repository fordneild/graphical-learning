  there can be no doubt about it _meta_end_dot_

 her husband says he wants to slow it down to fight global warming and hillary herself now admits she wants to garnish wages or something equivalent to pay for her allegedly _meta_dollor_ref_ billion healthcare scheme _meta_end_dot_

 and let s be on point here there has yet to be a healthcare system that has come in at projections _meta_end_dot_

 all of them have exceeded budget projections so her _meta_dollor_ref_ billion is probably around _meta_dollor_ref_ billion _meta_end_dot_

 from this week with george stephanopolous today hillary had to be asked the question three times in a row to get her to answer _meta_end_dot_
