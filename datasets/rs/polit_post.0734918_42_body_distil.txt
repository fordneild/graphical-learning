  republican presidential candidate mike huckabee has named ed rollins as his national campaign chairman _meta_end_dot_

 rollins served as the national campaign director to ronald reagan in the _meta_number_ref_ presidential election in which reagan won _meta_number_ref_ states while defeating former vice president walter mondale _meta_end_dot_

 rollins will make it possible for huckabee to be portrayed as the second coming of reagan surging in poll after poll i was clearly wrong in assuming that huckabee was no more than a distraction that would s care the living daylights out of a lot of moderates of both parties _meta_end_dot_

 you can watch rollins discuss his new gig with lou dobbs in the following video update i have corrected the reference to the reagan landslide _meta_end_dot_
