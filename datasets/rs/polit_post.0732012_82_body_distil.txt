  it was only a couple of weeks ago that harry reid headed down to the floor of the senate to excoriate the war effort _meta_end_dot_

 when he decided to find success in iraq he decided to deviate from his prepared script _meta_end_dot_

 lamenting the loss of lives in bush s war reid decided to undermine all success our troops have had while using their deaths to make political points _meta_end_dot_

 he said he failed to note the massive numbers of iraqi refugees who are pouring back into iraq _meta_end_dot_

 he failed to note the success we have had training iraqi soldiers _meta_end_dot_

 he failed to note any legitimate successes _meta_end_dot_

 in fact given that we have worked to stop intra iraqi violence by citing ethnic cleansing as the reason for our success he is in fact decry our troops failure _meta_end_dot_

 yesterday harry reid stepped to the microphone again to say reid s comments do nothing but keep his base of anti war leftist fringe anti americans happy _meta_end_dot_

 and his words are comfortable propaganda for enemy terrorists and a useful tool to demoralize our troops _meta_end_dot_

 harry reid is tokyo rose _meta_end_dot_

 check that and thanks to beth and steve _meta_end_dot_

 i think we re going to have to go with haw haw harry _meta_end_dot_
