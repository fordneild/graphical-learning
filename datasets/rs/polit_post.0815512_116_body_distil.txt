 in addition to this being the _meta_number_ref_rd anniversary of my birth it is the _meta_number_ref_th anniversary of casey at bat appearing in the san francisco examiner under the name phin the outlook wasn t brilliant for barack obama that day and then when he was trounced in west virginia while kentucky and puerto rico did the same in a dc hotel many of hillary s supporters were forcibly removed while in deep despair _meta_end_dot_

 they thought if only obama could win a blue state primary he could then get a whack at that keep reading _meta_end_dot_

 but the liberal dukakis preceded obama as did jimmy carter a liberal none the better so upon the left the soros the huffington and the kos a grim melancholy sat but in iowa he won a caucus despite the religion they clung to all break through the general election wall and when the dust had lifted the people saw what had occurred stood atop the democrat herd _meta_end_dot_

 then from the pink clothed liberals of the country there rose a lusty yell he doesn t need to go to iraq even if it s been _meta_number_ref_ days they exclaimed because the truth would obscure that there was an ease in obama s manner as he twisted the words of his opponent in many a place and when challenged on these points it is dismissed as distraction with the cheshire grin of a cat _meta_end_dot_

 thousands of eyes are on him as he talks about change to what exactly no one knows and when others point out his lack of gravitas his lack of experience and a lack of grip those points are divisive they are dismissed without a care a first chance at real leadership the ball unheeded sped up from the land there went up a muffled roar if it gets too tough will he quit midgame someone asked with a smile on a picture obama s visage shone sand on the beach is no replacement for the sand our troops are on the proud and the few distraction _meta_end_exclamation_

 divisive cried team obama while they stick to their chant of yes we can and before we knew it the flag went back on the lapel and hints of a trip to iraq were made plain _meta_end_dot_

 but instead of meeting with soldiers and generals and standing up for israel obama dismisses those contentions distraction _meta_end_question_

 divisive _meta_end_question_

 the clintonian move hardly speaks of the new politics that obama touts _meta_end_question_

 is the move of desperation a hint at something at the tough road obama has to go _meta_end_question_

 somewhere people are bitter and clinging to their hard earned dollars their faith and their country without a doubt
