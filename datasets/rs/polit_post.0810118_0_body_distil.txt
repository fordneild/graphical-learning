  remember elisabeth bumiller _meta_end_question_

 she s that new york times reporter who tried to attack john mccain on the plane a couple of months ago _meta_end_dot_

 our dan mclaughlin characterized the interaction as a gotcha question about an old story on which there are no new facts and the reporter is just trying to pick a fight well _meta_end_dot_

 bumiller is at it again doing yeoman s work for barack obama _meta_end_dot_

 this time it is an unsourced hit piece lacking in facts _meta_end_dot_

 or quotes _meta_end_dot_

 what are we talking about _meta_end_question_

 read on _meta_end_dot_

 let s look at some examples well _meta_end_dot_

 which prominent members _meta_end_question_

 are they willing to give unnamed quotes _meta_end_question_

 apparently not because they aren t in the article _meta_end_dot_

 no quotes no facts _meta_end_dot_

 next again _meta_end_dot_

 got a quote _meta_end_question_

 any actual evidence that anyone actually believes this _meta_end_question_

 or just unsourced unquoted statements by a reporter who is known to be hostile to john mccain _meta_end_question_

 or scowcroft is said to have expressed _meta_end_question_

 did he express or not _meta_end_question_

 if he did quote him like a journalist _meta_end_dot_

 otherwise bumiller is just trading in gossip _meta_end_dot_

 in fact the only quotes in the story come from former secretary of state lawrence eagleburger _meta_end_dot_

 the quote that would allegedly support the lede is emphasis added so a whole story is based around a quote that includes maybe its too strong i can t prove it and but i m worried _meta_end_dot_

 that s not journalism _meta_end_dot_

 that s just a hit piece _meta_end_dot_

 bumiller and her editors should be ashamed of themselves for abandoning standards like this _meta_end_dot_

 give the new york times a call at _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ or _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ and tell them what you think of these hatchet jobs _meta_end_dot_
