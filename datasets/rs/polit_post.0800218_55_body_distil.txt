  as the iowa voters prepare to go to the polls and their places of caucus the individuals and organizations conservatives respect are raising endorsement flags above their heads declaring their allegiances _meta_end_dot_

 it is time for me to follow suit _meta_end_dot_

 and there is no question in my mind that there is one candidate in this cycle who truly stands above the others in several significant areas _meta_end_dot_

 that candidate is mitt romney _meta_end_dot_

 please do read on _meta_end_dot_

 i share so many opinions with my colleague thomas but on this one i must break from him _meta_end_dot_

 all of the candidates in this nomination battle have important and significant qualifications that cannot be underestimated _meta_end_dot_

 yes they have their flaws but surely we could trust rudy giuliani the man who fixed the unfixable city to be an effective commander in chief surely we could trust john mccain patriot war hero old man who shakes fist at clouds to be a just if irritable potus surely we could trust fred thompson irascible conservative hewn from old growth timber and stained with single malt to slug the hippies and cut the size of government surely we could trust mike huckabee to use his silver tongue to make naral and the aclu s collective heads explode on a daily basis surely we could trust ron paul albeit in an alternate parallel universe where human nature does not exist and there is no need for interstate highways to rule his idyllic randian paradise with a soft yet perfectionist touch fanned with palm fronds by volunteer oompah loompahs who sing glorious songs about the gold standard that would make your heart break _meta_end_dot_

 these are good committed men _meta_end_dot_

 there is much in them to appreciate _meta_end_dot_

 yet these candidates all pale when compared to the man mitt romney _meta_end_dot_

 some may point out that mitt romney has the least political experience of any candidate in this field _meta_end_dot_

 this is of course a bigoted lie _meta_end_dot_

 the least politically experienced candidate in this field is after all alan keyes _meta_end_dot_

 and mitt romney s achievements in his lone electoral victory in massachusetts cannot be underestimated in any respect _meta_end_dot_

 as everyone who knows anything knows massachusetts residents speak of the romney years with a mournful fondness unmatched in human history except perhaps of adam and eve speaking in their old age of the lost garden of eden _meta_end_dot_

 most cannot speak of it without breaking into a fountain of regretful tears crying on street corners wearing sackcloth and ashes as they beg for the return of their lost executive _meta_end_dot_

 in the waning days of the romney rule one fellow i know actually took to standing outside of the governor s mansion holding a boombox above his head playing in your eyes begging the governor to stay wailing as if pining for a lost lover _meta_end_dot_

 but massachusetts loss will be america s gain as our golden hero brings his unique amalgam of talent in such a critical time in our nation s history _meta_end_dot_

 he has run the best statewide healthcare insurance plan in the country the best investment capital group in the global economy and the best olympics pageant in the history of mankind _meta_end_dot_

 imagine what such a man can do with the united nations _meta_end_exclamation_

 i know i for one am very excited _meta_end_dot_

 some may say that romney is merely steve forbes circa _meta_number_ref_ a wealthy man attempting to buy a nomination with few principles but a better face _meta_end_dot_

 this is a shallow bigoted lie _meta_end_dot_

 mitt romney s other physical features are also far more attractive than mr _meta_end_dot_

 forbes as anyone could tell you _meta_end_dot_

 mr _meta_end_dot_

 forbes also showed himself to be an inflexible and non representative politician what with his loyalty to the so called flat tax and his dedicated work on behalf of fiscal conservatism _meta_end_dot_

 to be charitable perhaps it is true that in one area and one area only mitt romney lags behind mr _meta_end_dot_

 forbes mr _meta_end_dot_

 forbes has an obvious and ironic sense of humor and wit as displayed with verve on saturday night live while governor romney s laugh has been called robot like less human than al gore and like a horse coughing on a large fly by some _meta_end_dot_

 but no worries he is cognizant of this minor personal flaw we are continuing to work with the focus group on this and will have the romney laugh resolved into a smooth hearty guffaw in time for the general election _meta_end_dot_

 some may say that romney s endorsement by the national review was a dark moment in the history of that fine journal _meta_end_dot_

 this is yet another bigoted lie _meta_end_dot_

 the truth is that the new york offices of the national review have been very even handed throughout this entire process _meta_end_dot_

 they have weighed each candidate equally and found the rest wanting _meta_end_dot_

 they do have high standards the national review famously declined to endorse dwight d _meta_end_dot_

 eisenhower after all but in each and every way that was meaningful mitt romney represents their views _meta_end_dot_

 this brings us to an important point _meta_end_dot_

 some may say that romney is not a candidate who can be trusted _meta_end_dot_

 this is another bigoted lie _meta_end_dot_

 on the contrary we can absolutely trust him _meta_end_exclamation_

 we can trust him to follow the path that our country charts for him _meta_end_dot_

 are we not interested in representative government _meta_end_question_

 of course we are _meta_end_exclamation_

 and mitt romney is perhaps the most representative of all the candidates to ever seek the presidency of any nation ever even the imaginary ones with the aforementioned oompah loompahs there is nothing untrustworthy about this man not even his hair _meta_end_dot_

 when the electorate wants him to believe something he believes it _meta_end_exclamation_

 when they want him to oppose something he opposes it _meta_end_exclamation_

 when they are divided he waffles _meta_end_exclamation_

 this is man is not just the one to lead our nation he symbolizes it in all its indecisive fickle greatness just as ronald reagan did when he stopped being pro choice _meta_end_exclamation_

 some may say that comparing romney to reagan is like comparing _meta_number_ref_ degrees to the beatles _meta_end_dot_

 but they are by that very argument revealing themselves as nothing more than shallow bigots who have allowed their bigoted minds to overwhelm their slightly less bigoted hearts to create a bigoted bigot fest of bigotry _meta_end_dot_

 the example however provides some interesting comparisons _meta_end_dot_

 it is true that america loves all things processed and manufactured one need only note the aisles of meats cheeses music television and grande lite vanilla soy frappucinos _meta_end_dot_

 but it is also true that for every giddy screaming fan of such sparkling pre packaged talent as ashley simpson jamie lynn spears or hannah montana there are also player haters who denounce these nipped tucked remastered and vacuum sealed productions as sickeningly sweet or almost repulsive or no talent assclowns yet as the republican brand faces an identity crisis shouldn t we take a cue from reality television and the boy band mafia _meta_end_question_

 the american people like things that are processed predictable and fluctuate as needed _meta_end_dot_

 don t we believe as free market conservatives that the market should get what it wants _meta_end_question_

 this is an on demand culture and it s time we met the demand with the man who understands how to adapt the best and the fastest to suit the needs of the moment _meta_end_dot_

 don t you see _meta_end_question_

 when the bigoted liars attack mitt romney for saying things like let me check my notes on an issue as important as the tactical surge in iraq they are merely confusing a negative with a positive _meta_end_dot_

 aren t you tired of the tone deaf administration we ve got right now _meta_end_question_

 under a mitt romney administration our president will understand america enough to know that he needs to check the polls up to the very minute of the state of the union address to determine what he ought to say about our global warming policy _meta_end_dot_

 want to make it illegal to drive cars _meta_end_question_

 want to make it illegal not to drive a hummer _meta_end_question_

 america now you too can decide _meta_end_exclamation_

 just dial the number and press _meta_number_ref_ or _meta_number_ref_ respectively to make your voice heard _meta_end_dot_

 some may say such as redstate s own dan mclaughlin in his well written but clearly wrong headed series on the unbearable lightness of mitt that romney is a liability for the republican party that he has the highest negatives of any potential nominee rivaling hillary clinton s _meta_end_dot_

 some may say that mitt romney s path to the nomination would be a victory for the lowest common denominator _meta_end_dot_

 and some may say that given the power of the executive branch mitt romney s cadre of loyal supporters will be like clintonites on speed leaving a path of vindictive destruction as they target bigoted liars to be investigated audited and personally embarrassed _meta_end_dot_

 these are all bigoted lies and if you believe them please register your complaint below while including your email permanent address and ssn for our files _meta_end_dot_

 we will contact you after the election _meta_end_dot_

 i have chosen not to listen to such fools _meta_end_dot_

 fie upon them _meta_end_dot_

 it is the dawn of the age of the pre packaged candidate _meta_end_dot_

 look on mitt romney s works ye mighty bigots and despair _meta_end_dot_
