  in an earlier post i endorsed barack obama as the best choice for democratic nominee but that doesn t mean i think he should be president _meta_end_dot_

 the two most important issues for me are the economy which i ll address in a later post and the war against militant islamism and the most important part of the war is iraq _meta_end_dot_

 i have serious problems with obama s plan and statements and political record on the subject _meta_end_dot_

 in last tuesday s debate obama brought up the familiar refrain about judgment and the choice to go to war in the first place _meta_end_dot_

 quote obama s brilliant answer killed a flock of birds with one stone he differentiated himself from an opponent where there is little real daylight between the two he made clear that his opinions are more closely aligned with the party base and he successfully skirted around the fact that he is a freshman senator with basically two years of legislative experience on the national stage _meta_end_dot_

 most importantly he successfully diverted the discussion away from his judgment on an issue of equal if not greater importance whether to draw down our troops or make a fundamental change in the strategy _meta_end_dot_

 in january _meta_number_ref_ during iraq s darkest hour obama was clearly against the surge strategy _meta_end_dot_

 more below the fold _meta_end_dot_

 obama s comment betrayed a lack of understanding of what the strategy was really about because the whole point of the coin strategy is to create an environment where insurgents will choose to resolve differences through the political process rather than by violence _meta_end_dot_

 either that or he was being less than honest _meta_end_dot_

 obama had the chance to further examine petraeus strategy and in hypocritical fashion obama voted yea in confirming petraeus to four star general yet four days later he introduced process oriented legislation that would gut the petraeus plan _meta_end_dot_

 wanting to learn a little more i checked his campaign website and was even more disappointed starting with this sentence the statement is flatly and factually false as seen below hat tip to engram for the graphs _meta_end_dot_

 suicide bombings which are the exclusive province of al qaeda killed _meta_number_ref_ of _meta_number_ref_ civilians last month or _meta_percent_ref_ of the total and al qaeda was responsible for _meta_number_ref_ killings or _meta_percent_ref_ of the total _meta_end_dot_

 despite comparatively small numbers al qaeda remains lethal _meta_end_dot_

 shiite hit squads are also a problem _meta_end_dot_

 there were _meta_number_ref_ extra judicial killings last month meaning that these groups hunted down military age sunni males and killed them execution style _meta_end_dot_

 but basically there are _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ fewer civilian deaths per month under the current surge strategy _meta_end_dot_

 under the obama plan there is every reason to believe civilian casualties would have looked like this _meta_end_dot_

 why _meta_end_question_

 because going by obama s proposed legislation his plan called for unilateral troop draw downs during a time when terrorist attacks and extra judicial killings were raging _meta_end_dot_

 of course the trend lines are arguable but the conclusions in the april _meta_number_ref_ national intelligence estimate are not which said it couldn t be clearer to me that the mccain petraeus plan has made significant strides in convincing jihadists that they are failing in iraq _meta_end_dot_

 obama s so called plan which called for cutting and running when suicide bombings were peaking would have signaled our defeat at the hands of these terrorists _meta_end_dot_

 obama s short sightedness on troop withdrawals would likely have inspired al qaeda co _meta_end_dot_

 to carry on the fight using iraq as a propaganda tool for recruiting more terrorists into their fold _meta_end_dot_

 i am convinced that there would be more militant islamists today if obama got what he wanted back in january _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 then there s his next sentence which is a whopper muqtada al sadr is a political leader and he stood down his jam militias last august and he recently extended his ceasefire _meta_end_dot_

 that s political progress _meta_end_dot_

 although progress has been halting political leaders in the national government have made significant strides at resolving political differences _meta_end_dot_

 although no oil revenue sharing bill has passed political leaders have set up a system for sharing oil revenues _meta_end_dot_

 when sunni tribal sheiks joined the coalition and turned their collective backs on al qaeda political progress was made _meta_end_dot_

 obviously much work remains to be done the fact remains that obama s statement is outrageously untrue _meta_end_dot_

 also it is arguable that there is a civil war in iraq but obama and the democratic party continue to trot out this storyline _meta_end_dot_

 there are competing factions to be sure and those factions frequently resort to violence _meta_end_dot_

 but calling iraq a civil war glosses over the actions of al qaeda whose primary goal is to foment a civil war between shiites and sunnis and they are failing in that endeavor _meta_end_dot_

 it ignores the fact that northern iraq is stable _meta_end_dot_

 it ignores the fact that southern iraq is virtually all shiite and run by shiites _meta_end_dot_

 it ignores the fact that anbar province is virtually all sunni and is run by sunnis _meta_end_dot_

 the fact of the matter is that there are mixed sunni shiite areas in iraq especially baghdad where sectarian violence has occurred and has sparked a refugee problem _meta_end_dot_

 calling it a civil war is a matter of opinion not fact and that s what obama does all too often _meta_end_dot_

 he conveys opinions giving the impression to impressionable voters that they are facts when they are really not _meta_end_dot_

 it is slickness reminiscent of slick willie himself _meta_end_dot_

 more from obama s campaign website obama was not a candidate for the u s _meta_end_dot_

 senate in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 he ran for a u s _meta_end_dot_

 house seat in _meta_number_ref_ and lost and in _meta_number_ref_ he resigned from the state senate to run for the u s _meta_end_dot_

 senate _meta_end_dot_

 in _meta_number_ref_ obama was running for reelection to the state senate a position he held since _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 his district has a huge democratic majority so he was an incumbent with a safe seat therefore it is ridiculous for him to claim that he put his career on the line _meta_end_dot_

 obama continued this lie in last tuesday s debate when he said my objections to the war in iraq were simply not simply a speech referring to his october _meta_number_ref_ speech against invading iraq _meta_end_dot_

 i was in the midst of a u s _meta_end_dot_

 senate campaign obama s career on the line nonsense is under the section titled judgment you can trust on his website which leads me this question how can you trust a man s judgment when you cannot justifiably trust his facts _meta_end_question_

 again going by his campaign website obama believes the following this is troubling on multiple levels first because obama says not a word about strategy and tactics _meta_end_dot_

 it s all about sending troops home nothing about the situation on the ground _meta_end_dot_

 second obama s timeline conflicts with general petraeus timeline _meta_end_dot_

 what s more obama s large and precipitous withdrawal conflicts with the latest national intelligence estimate which says the following obama s logic is the exact opposite of the nie and he is on the wrong side of the issue _meta_end_dot_

 finally obama s phased surrender plan conflicts with his own words in _meta_number_ref_ now his mantra is that by leaving reconciliation among iraqis will happen and everything will get better even though such significant withdrawals will likely destabilize the country reintroduce chaos and reignite sectarian violence _meta_end_dot_

 the environment obama seeks is the very same one which allowed al qaeda to grow and fester _meta_end_dot_

 here s some more illogic newsflash _meta_end_dot_

 al qaeda is in iraq right now _meta_end_dot_

 they re the ones responsible for _meta_percent_ref_ of civilian deaths last month and they re the ones who general petraeus still considers our biggest challenge there _meta_end_dot_

 obama s statement makes no sense because it assumes that al qaeda is already gone _meta_end_dot_

 obama also wants to surge our diplomacy _meta_end_dot_

 another newsflash _meta_end_dot_

 it s already happening _meta_end_dot_

 ambassador crocker is in iraq coordinating his efforts with general petraeus and working constantly with the various iraqi factions to help them achieve their political benchmarks _meta_end_dot_

 obama s statements on iraq lead me to believe that he would be a foreign policy disaster for america _meta_end_dot_

 if he gets his way iraq would destabilize reversing all the hard fought gains made and adversely affecting our national security _meta_end_dot_

 even if you accept that he made the right judgment in _meta_number_ref_ his judgments in _meta_number_ref_ and _meta_number_ref_ on the surge strategy are more important because they are current and because losing in iraq could have calamitous repercussions on our country _meta_end_dot_

 vietnam was bad enough _meta_end_dot_

 as tom maguire notes obama is not running in _meta_number_ref_ and he s not running against george w _meta_end_dot_

 bush _meta_end_dot_

 the issue on the table is what obama would do in iraq today _meta_end_dot_

 to me it looks like he d rather surrender no matter all the remarkable gains we ve made since september _meta_end_dot_
