  you could say that barack obama pulled a john mccain with his verbal gaffes regarding iraq afghanistan arabic speaking translators and the war on terror in his may _meta_number_ref_ speech to supporters in cape girardeau missouri _meta_end_dot_

 you could say that but you would be wrong _meta_end_dot_

 conflating sunni and shi a _meta_end_question_

 two months ago pundits and politicians alike descended upon senator mccain with accusations of confusion a lack of touch and even outright dishonesty when the republican presidential nominee said that al qaeda fighters in iraq have been receiving funding training and equipment from iran during the last year plus of the iraq war _meta_end_dot_

 mr _meta_end_dot_

 mccain conflated sunni and shi a organizations which clearly represent opposing sides in the iraqi civil war sic crowed the liberal web site thinkprogress an outlet with its own track record of mixing up historical events _meta_end_dot_

 in an abcnews blog post entitled err jordan reporter jake tapper wrote that mccain seemed to step in it with his assertion that sunni al qaeda and shi a iran were working together asking if the senator was suffering from jet lag tapper who has been one of the most solid reporters of this campaign season later posted an opposing viewpoint if not an outright correction susan rice then still a senior foreign policy adviser to barack obama she was later relieved of the position for undermining mr _meta_end_dot_

 obama s claims that he would initiate an immediate withdrawal from iraq if elected and for referring to hillary clinton as a monster called mccain s assertion very bizarre saying that there is no body of evidence to suggest iran is aiding al qaeda in iraq and noting that mr _meta_end_dot_

 mccain had made the same statement three times in as many days _meta_end_dot_

 surely he must know as senator lieberman reminded him that iran is not engaged with al qaeda in iraq _meta_end_dot_

 i don t know if he is confused or is he cynically trying to conflate al qaeda and iran as cheney and bush did al qaeda and iraq in _meta_number_ref_ and _meta_number_ref_ read on _meta_end_dot_

 iran and al qaeda working together the dirty little secret of the entire mccain al qaeda iran affair was the fact that mr _meta_end_dot_

 mccain was correct in his initial statement al qaeda has in fact been receiving funding training and equipment from iran during the last year plus of the iraq war and has been offering cross border assistance to shi a militias for much longer _meta_end_dot_

 mccain s statement was entirely correct at the time his only real mistake in that press conference was to listen to joseph lieberman who whispered a correction that mccain incorrectly contradicted himself by repeating _meta_end_dot_

 that iran would interfere heavily in iraq aiding al qaeda in the process is a reality that has been borne out by both evidence and intuition _meta_end_dot_

 in july of last year the new york sun reported that a senior leadership or management council for al qaeda meets regularly in eastern iran according to the classified portion of the latest national intelligence estimate on al qaeda in december the long war journal published an exclusive and exhaustive report on the ratlines via which iran was funneling supplies personnel and money into iraq _meta_end_dot_

 both reports and several others in the same vein were largely ignored by a mainstream media apparatus that appears focused on avoiding all implications that iraq s persian neighbor is and has been actively interfering in that country by supporting and aiding america s enemies both sunni and shi a _meta_end_dot_

 the case that iran and al qaeda are cooperating against the coalition is also bolstered by intuition and common sense _meta_end_dot_

 the possession of a common enemy has historically been a key instigator in the formation of alliances between both individuals and nations see for example the hitler stalin nonagression pact or the american soviet cooperation that closely followed the nazi invasion of russia _meta_end_dot_

 the adhesive that a common enemy provides between unlikely groups has been demonstrated time and again over the course of the last few years in iraq as well _meta_end_dot_

 while reporting from the front lines in that country i have personally seen sunni and shi a band together in anbar province and elsewhere as tribal and citizens groups against al qaeda and other terrorist groups and networks _meta_end_dot_

 i have seen sunni and shi a drive each other from their homes and slaughter each other simply because of the killers strange combination of sectarian hate and innate bloodlust but i have also seen sunni and shi a working hand in hand to fight against the insurgency and i have seen them working hand in hand to fight america and to kill iraqi civilians _meta_end_dot_

 a lack of international understanding barack obama s may _meta_number_ref_ gaffe regarding afghanistan and a lack of arabic translators was far more fundamental and far more of a mistake than mr _meta_end_dot_

 mccain s stumbling over an assertion he knew to be true at the time _meta_end_dot_

 bringing up afghanistan a cause celebr of advocates of military withdrawal from iraq who want to avoid the appearance of total opposition to the war on terror at the missouri campaign stop mr _meta_end_dot_

 obama claimed that the u s _meta_end_dot_

 simply doesn t have enough capacity right now to deal with the initial front in america s seven year and counting global war on terror _meta_end_dot_

 part of the reason for this said obama is that arabic translators deployed in iraq are needed in afghanistan we only have a certain number of them and if they are all in iraq then its harder for us to use them in afghanistan he said _meta_end_dot_

 this statement was a head scratched for a pair reasons _meta_end_dot_

 the first is the fact that afghans are neither ethnically nor linguistically arabic the second that interpreters are almost _meta_percent_ref_ drawn from local populations rather than deployed by the u s _meta_end_dot_

 military _meta_end_dot_

 obama continued saying that we need agricultural specialists in afghanistan as well people who can help them develop other crops than heroin poppies because the drug trade in afghanistan is what is driving and financing these terrorist networks _meta_end_dot_

 so we need agricultural specialists _meta_end_dot_

 but if we are sending them to baghdad they re not in afghanistan zero sum foreign policy besides apparently having the two entirely different cultures languages ethnicities and agricultural specialties confused one can almost picture him shrugging and saying they all look alike to me mr _meta_end_dot_

 obama appears to be buying in to what might be called the nancy pelosi school of zero sum foreign policy in april ms _meta_end_dot_

 pelosi took to the floor of the house of representatives to ask the question when we know that the real war on terror is in afghanistan how can we have that real effort with a sustained effort in iraq continuing the fact that the u s _meta_end_dot_

 military and its associated teams of experts can operate in more than one place at a single time appears to be somewhat lost on pelosi and on obama much like the existence of a littany of differences between iraq and afghanistan _meta_end_dot_

 further the obama campaign s heated response to abcnews s initial report on the gaffe consisted in part of a defense of the call for arabic translators in a country that speaks pashtu farsi and other indo european languages as opposed to the semitic arabic language based on the need to interrogate foreign fighters in afghanistan this assertion brings up another interesting point _meta_end_dot_

 it appears that to mr _meta_end_dot_

 obama the presence of foreign fighters in afghanistan means that america needs to dedicate _meta_percent_ref_ of what he sees as being some of our most precious and scarce resources arabic speaking interpreters to that nation _meta_end_dot_

 interestingly the same situation vis a vis foreign fighters in iraq has caused obama and his ideological allies on the left to redouble their calls for a u s _meta_end_dot_

 withdrawal _meta_end_dot_

 this appears to be a result of the belief that such an influx of terrorists into iraq means that america is doing the wrong thing by remaining there to fight the enemy that the global war on terror was designed to combat and whose members are still streaming into that country to all but impale themselves on our soldiers bayonets _meta_end_dot_

 mr _meta_end_dot_

 obama s campaign platform includes securing america and re establishing her degraded standing in the world in part by promising to unconditionally meet with hostile foreign leaders like mahmoud ahmadinejad though with so many arabic translators apparently tied up in iraq it may be safe to assume that obama is concerned that none will be free to facilitate his meeting with the leader of the farsi speaking persian state _meta_end_dot_

 for someone who is building his case for the presidency on such a lofty idealistic premise obama insists on maintaining a troublingly naive inconsistent and uninformed view of the world s cultures and of international events _meta_end_dot_

 willful ignorance of the state of afghanistan when it comes to afghanistan in particular mr _meta_end_dot_

 obama s ignorance is both inexcusable and a circumstance entirely of his own making _meta_end_dot_

 after all as part of the job that the american taxpayer is currently paying him to do obama serves as chair of the senate subcommittee on europe the subcommittee that has jurisdiction over nato which in turn is the military authority under which the majority of allied operations in afghanistan are being conducted _meta_end_dot_

 at their february debate in cleveland ohio hillary clinton mr _meta_end_dot_

 obama s opponent in the democratic presidential primary pointed out that though nato is critical to our mission in afghanistan obama has held not one substantive hearing to do oversight to figure out what we can do to actually have a stronger presence with nato in afghanistan obama responded to the jab by saying well first of all i became chairman of this committee at the beginning of this campaign at the beginning of _meta_number_ref_ this provides a great deal of insight into mr _meta_end_dot_

 obama s priorities _meta_end_dot_

 unlike mr _meta_end_dot_

 mccain who famously said in _meta_number_ref_ when his poll numbers were falling through the floor in part because of his continued support for the war on terror that he would rather lose an election than lose a war obama s priorities appear to be structured roughly along the following lines campaigning for president takes the top spot after which follows a host of ideas and projects including occastionally showing up on the senate floor to cast votes _meta_end_dot_

 that in turn supersedes doing his job as the chairman of the senate subcommittee that oversees the alliance responsible for military operations and reconstruction in afghanistan _meta_end_dot_

 afghanistan is clearly very very important to mr _meta_end_dot_

 obama _meta_end_dot_

 this is made clear by his repeated talk about how _meta_number_ref_ million iraqi civilians should be abandoned to the islamic state of iraq jaish al islam the mahdi army and every other foreign and domestic militia and terrorist organization that is currently carrying out or attempting to carry out attacks in that country so that we can bring some troops home and use the others to shore up our efforts in afghanistan where the real war on terror apparently is and where we are clearly incapable of effectively doing much of anything as long as we have military personnel anywhere else in the world doing much of anything _meta_end_dot_

 afghanistan is clearly important to mr _meta_end_dot_

 obama _meta_end_dot_

 it just ranks far enough below running for president with the mass rallies and adulation that such a campaign involves that mr _meta_end_dot_

 obama just hasn t been able to tear himself away from his pursuit of power long enough to hold one single meeting of his senate subcommittee that is responsible for coalition efforts in afghanistan _meta_end_dot_

 foolishness borne of inexperience had mr _meta_end_dot_

 obama the experience to know that he needed to do a bit of homework before preaching to his choir of the masses about international affairs among other topics and the honesty to represent the facts as such he likely would have found that the situation in afghanistan and its relation to the effort in iraq is entirely different than he seems to believe _meta_end_dot_

 for example contrary to popular anti war opinion america did not abandon the effort in afghanistan when we opened a second major front in the war on terror by invading iraq _meta_end_dot_

 in fact the u s _meta_end_dot_

 has a similar number of troops on the ground in the former now that it did in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 the fact that a second major front was opened didn t necessitate an abandonment of the first rather it gave the international terrorists we were fighting two fronts to worry about _meta_end_dot_

 further compared to seven years ago afghanistan is an amazingly improved place something mr _meta_end_dot_

 obama would have known had he read the report entitled progress in afghanistan the nato report lays out the changes in that nation s security and infrastructural situation since the treaty organization began operations there fiver years ago _meta_end_dot_

 had mr _meta_end_dot_

 obama even read the opening paragraph to the report s executive summary which says set against the devastating effect of decades of conflict these five years have witnessed substantial progress in all spheres of afghan life from a reasonably stable security situation in most of the country to a massive increase in the number of health clinics and children in schools he would at least have been prepared to avoid looking completely ignorant of the state of affairs there _meta_end_dot_

 mr _meta_end_dot_

 obama would not have to claim that the situation in that country was entirely rosy in order to acknowledge the progress that has been made there in truth circumstances there are still far from ideal _meta_end_dot_

 however to do so he would have to admit that the doom and gloom scenaro that has become conventional wisdom on the left was not entirely accurate and his willingness to do that is highly doubtful at best so obama restricts himself to the standard politics as usual talking points when discussing the war on terror iraq was a mistake terrorists are only there because american soldiers are the u s _meta_end_dot_

 has sacrificed progress in afghanistan in order to fight the illegal war in iraq and al qaeda and the taliban are regenerating and regrowing in afghanistan without being challenged by coalition or afghan forces _meta_end_dot_

 the fact that very little of this is actually accurate rarely seems to affect the continuous repetition of the talking points _meta_end_dot_

 in fact the resurgence of the taliban and the renewed offensives against the coalition and the afghani forces that is was supposed to bring with it has never materialized in the way that the mainstream media and other doomsayers have been predicting for the past three years _meta_end_dot_

 while it is true that taliban and al qaeda personnel are still operating in the region the fact is that those holdouts find their safest haven in pakistan and in the waziristan region on the border of pakistan and afghanistan _meta_end_dot_

 this means that regardless the number of troops and various experts that the u s _meta_end_dot_

 has in afghanistan at any given time national borders will continue to effectively prevent full prosecution of these enemies _meta_end_dot_

 thus unless america plans on going to war in yet another nation in the near future something that mr _meta_end_dot_

 obama amidst his calls for immediate withdrawal from iraq has said that he is willing to do in the case of pakistan al qaeda and the afghan taliban will continue to have in pakistan a safe haven where they can rest and rearm ad infinitum _meta_end_dot_

 unlike john mccain s mistake in march which consisted of correcting his already correct statement regarding iranian al qaeda cooperation mr _meta_end_dot_

 obama s repeated assertions and policy promises regarding america s activities on the various fronts in the war on terror appear to be the result of willful ignorance an attempt at blatantly dishonest pandering to his anti american base or a dangerous combination of both _meta_end_dot_

 regardless the ignorance lack of experience and poor judgment that mr _meta_end_dot_

 obama continually reminds us he will if elected be bringing with him as he assumes the position of commander in chief and sole establisher of american foreign policy is a concern that should grow on american s minds every day as november approaches _meta_end_dot_
