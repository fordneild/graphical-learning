  last update probably our own constant reader civil truth has given us the link in comments to a report that mr _meta_end_dot_

 nava has confessed to creating a hoax _meta_end_dot_

 if that checks out then expel the _meta_end_dot_

 fellow _meta_end_dot_

 moe lane the nigh ultimate update ryan t anderson of first things has written a clear concise and balanced article reviewing the princeton incident _meta_end_dot_

 i recommend it to anybody prepared to start swinging over it _meta_end_dot_

 moe lane further update guess that neiwert will be getting involved after all former hoax and injury details complicate picture of assault via fausta _meta_end_dot_

 short version the kid wrote some anti gay slurs outside of his high school dorm room he s readily copped to doing that as part of a hoax but the anscombe society is asking that people not start shouting about the attack until it s confirmed that there actually was one _meta_end_dot_

 so there s that _meta_end_dot_

 otoh the same article reports that the cops are going off the record to say that this looks like a real attack _meta_end_dot_

 so there s that _meta_end_dot_

 otgh i think that the article implied that francesco nava is himself gay or formerly gay or something which tells us absolutely nothing about whether all of this is more or less likely to be true but will nonetheless be brandished by various people to support various arguments _meta_end_dot_

 ah the internet _meta_end_dot_

 moe lane update fausta lives in the area and she s a sensible sort so she ll probably be keeping on top of this _meta_end_dot_

 moe lane we either have a fairly serious hate crime going on here at princeton university or an elaborate hoax _meta_end_dot_

 let s walk through the chronology _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 several members of the anscombe society a princetonian conservative group that is pro chastity and anti gay marriage have reported receiving hate mail including death threats _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 it s also been reported that the response to this by princeton university was distinctly anemic _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 one of those students one francesco nava who has written what was apparently a not well received article about the university health service s providing of condoms here was reportedly attacked on friday night by two individuals who used the same language as that found in the emails _meta_end_dot_

 the reported injuries were relatively minor cuts abrasions and a mild concussion _meta_end_dot_

 more details here and here originally via instapundit all caught up then _meta_end_question_

 excellent _meta_end_dot_

 read on _meta_end_dot_

 first off a disclaimer while i was chaste for quite long periods of time in college it wasn t for lack of trying _meta_end_dot_

 in fact i would have been happy to be quite the filthy libertine if only i could have found somebody willing to indulge me _meta_end_dot_

 of course now that i am older happily married and have a kid i am of course free to be the absolute hypocrite and solemnly declare that college students shouldn t fornicate their brains out _meta_end_dot_

 and really they shouldn t and they are capable of not doing it agitprop to the contrary _meta_end_dot_

 but i m more concerned with the idiotic things that they re learning from their professors really _meta_end_dot_

 all of this means that i m not necessarily on the anscombe society s side in fact when it comes to same sex marriage i m on the other one with regard to their core issue _meta_end_dot_

 i m also quite aware that we ve had quite the rash of hate crime hoaxes coming from the other side lately there s nothing stopping one of ours from doing it alas and to be honest _meta_end_question_

 the timeline sounds a little smooth and there s not much ambiguity here _meta_end_dot_

 for all i know that s just a relic of the way this was reported you ll note that it s all campus newspapers reporting this so far but i still look with some interest in the university s conclusions _meta_end_dot_

 and they will have to investigate this now _meta_end_dot_

 as it is if this turns out to be real princeton university is severely hosed _meta_end_dot_

 there s already enough for a killer civil suit the last thing the university would need is some sort of suggestion that a cover up took place _meta_end_dot_

 for that matter i m kind of curious myself why it apparently requires an actual physical assault to make a university agency take notice of threats against conservatives and i suspect that all of you are kind of curious too _meta_end_dot_

 moe lane ps i am addressing the possibility that this is a hoax not because i seriously believe that it is one i don t have enough information yet either way but because it is not outside the realm of possibility and just because people like neiwert check under their beds each night for scary violent right wingers doesn t mean that i should do the equivalent _meta_end_dot_
