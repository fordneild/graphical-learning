  tuesday night john mccain won big and looked like a big man doing so _meta_end_dot_

 wednesday night john mccain looked small _meta_end_dot_

 i suppose that i can understand if mccain is feeling upset over the fact that he was the target of a number of negative ads from mitt romney _meta_end_dot_

 but after watching his performance during the debate at the reagan library i can t say that i feel all that sympathetic _meta_end_dot_

 maybe i should but i don t _meta_end_dot_

 see the problem stems from statements mccain has made arguing that romney wanted timetables to be agreed on that would have short circuited the reconstruction effort in iraq _meta_end_dot_

 mccain claimed that romney s calls for timetables would have brought about a precipitous withdrawal of american troops from iraq and thus he sought to lump romney with democrats who want to use timetables to bring the troops home _meta_end_dot_

 it is true that romney did say that timetables were needed _meta_end_dot_

 however his quote deserves to be flushed out read on _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 want more _meta_end_question_

 here is the full video _meta_end_dot_

 and yes i know that this is all over the internets and earlier here on redstate but it bears watching again just to be absolutely clear about this there is no way that any fair minded person could watch romney s comments and conclude that he was using the word timetables in the same way that the democrats were using it and with the intention to bring about a precipitous withdrawal _meta_end_dot_

 the quote above and the video could not possibly be more explicit on the topic _meta_end_dot_

 romney s position is entirely consistent with the mainstream republican view on this issue _meta_end_dot_

 but mccain like a grumpy old man who decided that he ought to see just how far he could push a lie tried to argue that because the word timetables was a buzzword for precipitous withdrawal romney was for precipitous withdrawal because he used the word timetables never mind the context which made absolutely clear that romney was not for short circuiting the mission in iraq _meta_end_dot_

 mccain was and is bound and determined to prove that romney wanted to use timetables to bring about precipitous withdrawal and he won t let anything like inconvenient facts stand in the way _meta_end_dot_

 i mean really saying the word timetables in an interview doesn t mean that you agree with harry reid on the need to pull american troops out immediately _meta_end_dot_

 does that actually have to be explained _meta_end_question_

 if it s the rule that the mere utterance of a word symbolizes the worst kind of identification with that word then i suppose we can have all sorts of fun with mccain _meta_end_dot_

 surely he said words like bad evil and stupid in the past _meta_end_dot_

 therefore john mccain s ethics are beyond questionable and his iq is in the low two digits _meta_end_dot_

 see _meta_end_question_

 i can play this game too _meta_end_dot_

 i really don t like writing this but mccain is lying _meta_end_dot_

 these are lies _meta_end_dot_

 they are being told by a liar _meta_end_dot_

 and a bad one at that again anyone can tell that mccain is blatantly misrepresenting romney s position on this issue _meta_end_dot_

 and this is being done by the candidate in the driver s seat for the republican presidential nomination _meta_end_dot_

 one wonders what mccain would do if he felt he was behind _meta_end_dot_

 this is reprehensible _meta_end_dot_

 mccain tried to cover this up by arguing in addition to the above fatuous nonsense he seeks to peddle to a public he must deem genuinely imbecilic that romney was reticent on the surge because in december _meta_number_ref_ he took the position that he could not comment on the surge as the governor of massachusetts _meta_end_dot_

 paul mirengoff swats this argument aside ronald reagan whose library hosted the debate was a man of grace dignity and genuine good humor _meta_end_dot_

 mccain is the anti reagan _meta_end_dot_

 he is dark and bullying and his behavior was appalling _meta_end_dot_

 if he becomes the republican nominee i will support him because his ideas will be closer to mine than will the eventual democratic nominee s _meta_end_dot_

 too bad however that if mccain runs in the fall i will be voting against someone this november rather than voting for john mccain _meta_end_dot_

 oh and by the way should mccain actually descend from olympus to read this blog post enough with the constant rumsfeld trashing _meta_end_dot_

 we get it _meta_end_dot_

 you don t like him _meta_end_dot_

 guess what _meta_end_question_

 a reliable source tells me rumsfeld doesn t care _meta_end_dot_

 also clean up your own act before casting stones _meta_end_dot_
