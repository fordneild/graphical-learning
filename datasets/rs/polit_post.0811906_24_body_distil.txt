  sure i won t eat bacon dogs _meta_end_dot_

 but that s because i m jewish _meta_end_dot_

 other people like bacon dogs just fine and are more than happy to brave certain supposed hazards to get them _meta_end_dot_

 alas big government always finds a way to be a killjoy doesn t it _meta_end_question_

 and it s not just consumers who are unhappy of course _meta_end_dot_

 honest decent hardworking bacon dog sellers are being ridiculously victimized thanks to the heavy hand of the nanny state both legally and financially _meta_end_dot_

 and the nanny state s regulations are creating you guessed it a bacon dog black market _meta_end_dot_

 this stuff would be funny if it wasn t so sad _meta_end_dot_
