  for confusing what you d do if you were us for what we ll do particularly when it comes to using graphic _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ imagery to get john mccain elected _meta_end_dot_

 while i think that the footage from that day should be more public it s not so that my party can win elections _meta_end_dot_

 it s so that my country is reminded who we re currently at war with _meta_end_dot_

 save your contempt for your bathroom mirror _meta_end_dot_

 that being said the video below is perhaps not a little diagnostic of what topics might alarm the left and far be it from me to interfere with a group so determined to launch a full fledged political civil war particularly when their utter collapse would be a net benefit for the united states of america _meta_end_dot_

 so check it out for that at least see also instapundit hot air and the tiger at home _meta_end_dot_

 and just remember democrats should obama win the nomination you ll be relying on people like the guy who put this together to help the junior senator from illinois get elected president in november _meta_end_dot_

 have a nice day _meta_end_dot_
