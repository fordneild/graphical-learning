  tomorrow the president will decide whether or not the constitution is still a legally binding document _meta_end_dot_

 seriously _meta_end_dot_

 after congress passed the omnibus spending bill members of congress inserted into the conference report that accompanied the legislation more than _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ earmarks worth several billion dollars _meta_end_dot_

 the earmarks were not voted on by the house and senate _meta_end_dot_

 yet congress maintains that the earmarks are legally binding _meta_end_dot_

 this violates the process for passing legislation in the constitution of the united states _meta_end_dot_

 tomorrow the president will decide whether he should issue an executive order telling government agencies to ignore the earmarks _meta_end_dot_

 if the president issues the executive order he will be enforcing the legislative process the constitution says we must follow _meta_end_dot_

 if the president does not issue the executive order he will be rewarding congress for ignoring the constitution _meta_end_dot_

 please call the president at _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ and tell him to issue the executive order on earmarks _meta_end_dot_

 you can also email comments whitehouse gov _meta_end_dot_

 also please call senator mitch mcconnell who is pushing the president to ignore the constitution _meta_end_dot_

 tell mitch mcconnell to stop ignoring the constitution and support the executive order _meta_end_dot_

 you can call him at _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_
