  as in all democratic primaries i m rooting for injuries _meta_end_dot_

 in this case that means rooting for hillary clinton _meta_end_dot_

 can you imagine the delicious schadenfreude if the polls yet again consistently show obama with a comfortable lead and yet when the democratic voters go into the booth in private they yet again pull the lever for the white folks _meta_end_question_

 i m rooting for clinton hard in this one folks _meta_end_dot_

 open thread _meta_end_dot_

 update this is what i get for opening an open thread without checking a news site first _meta_end_dot_

 cnn calls it for obama _meta_end_dot_

 i m still very interested to see the final margin _meta_end_dot_

 update it looks at this point like obama is going to double up clinton a shocking _meta_number_ref_ point lead with _meta_percent_ref_ of the precincts in _meta_end_dot_

 the rcp average showed this race as obama _meta_number_ref_ today this again counts as a huge and stupendous polling error involving obama except this time in the other direction _meta_end_dot_

 i have no idea what it means _meta_end_dot_
