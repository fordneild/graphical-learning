  terrorist group hamas endorsed barack obama and his key spokesman david axelrod didn t know about it _meta_end_dot_

 it s probably something he should have been clued into considering the criticism opponents will have to something so damning _meta_end_dot_

 when he was told about it by the american spectator s phillip klein axelrod said he had no idea about that read on _meta_end_dot_

 the hamas statement was this axelrod replied that it s flattering when anybody says that barack obama would follow in kennedy s footsteps klein then asked axelrod why obama did not urge former president jimmy carter not to meet with the terrorist group _meta_end_dot_

 axelrod was stuck again saying only that obama had disagreed with the decision _meta_end_dot_

 unlike other political leaders though he did not make any efforto to dissuade carter _meta_end_dot_

 i don t believe obama is a hamas supporter obviously _meta_end_dot_

 however that a terrorist group is so aligned with obama s policies and ideas bears much concern _meta_end_dot_

 his connection as well to former unapologetic america hating terrorist bill ayers doesn t help either _meta_end_dot_

 lots of lefties were upset that obama was supposedly pummeled in last night s debate for trivial issues that are not important _meta_end_dot_

 their positions on the political issues aren t going to change much but their character flaws personal relationships and freudian slips say much more about the authentic person we may elect to lead america _meta_end_dot_

 for once obama didn t get a pass from the media _meta_end_dot_

 he s being endorsed by hamas he s insulting a large segment of america he s not apologizing for close connections with america haters _meta_end_dot_

 he may be flattered to be compared to jfk but let s be real he s no kennedy _meta_end_dot_

 ari fleischer put it well tonight on hannity and colmes when he said obama s had a pattern of people who he is connected to who define wrongdoing and he hasn t stood up to them h t hat tip weekly standard
