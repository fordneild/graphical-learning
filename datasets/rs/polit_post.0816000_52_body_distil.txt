  because of the very same crass power hungry behavior we have come to expect from the clintons barack obama is presented with a fair amount of trouble _meta_end_dot_

 despite hillary clinton s endorsement of obama in today s speech announcing the suspension of her campaign some of clinton s supporters are not quite yet willing to come on board here _meta_end_dot_

 they could have potentially transferred their loyalties long ago but hillary clinton decided to drag out the campaign to the point that her supporters became quite embittered indeed _meta_end_dot_

 oh sure most of these people will go back to supporting senator obama _meta_end_dot_

 but some may not _meta_end_dot_

 and in a close election that may make all of the difference in the world _meta_end_dot_

 barack obama may have lots and lots of reasons to dislike hillary clinton at the end of all of this _meta_end_dot_

 she has done everything within her power to prevent democrats from being able to come together earlier and united their party against john mccain _meta_end_dot_

 maybe obama can patch the party back together soon enough _meta_end_dot_

 but if he can t and if more people like ms _meta_end_dot_

 ubaldo either sit on their hands or end up supporting john mccain obama will know who to thank _meta_end_dot_
