  barack obama says no lobbyists allowed barack obama says this applies to the dnc _meta_end_dot_

 of course he has a problem _meta_end_dot_

 pointing out that two of the dnc s vice chairs are registered lobbyists _meta_end_dot_

 so what is the obama campaign going to do _meta_end_question_

 they say john mccain is not allowed to talk about this _meta_end_dot_

 they say john mccain is hypocritical to harass obama on this because he has so many connections to lobbyists _meta_end_dot_

 best i can figure obama must staff his campaign with high school dropouts because they very clearly don t understand the meaning of the word hypocrisy _meta_end_dot_

 hypocrisy means you barry set standards that you barry are failing to live up to _meta_end_dot_

 pointing out your hypocrisy is not itself hypocrisy it s actually shoot fish in barrel _meta_end_dot_
