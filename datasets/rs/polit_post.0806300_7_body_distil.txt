  howard dean seems pretty proud of himself this weekend having come up with the best quip he s had in _meta_end_dot_

 well ever _meta_end_dot_

 he says since the gop nominee is an old white guy that today s republican party looks like the _meta_number_ref_s and talks like the _meta_number_ref_s that s all well and good for dr _meta_end_dot_

 dean _meta_end_dot_

 but for those who actually care about history you may recall that john mccain spent most of the _meta_number_ref_s at the naval academy learning how to fight and if necessary die for his country _meta_end_dot_

 and as more than one friend pointed out to me this weekend we all seem to recall that particularly in the _meta_number_ref_s democrats were in the wrong and republicans were actually kind of you know in the right _meta_end_dot_

 the most famous democrat and most famous republican of the time of course provide easy examples i think in this case the republicans of the _meta_number_ref_s are fine by me _meta_end_dot_

 for his part dr _meta_end_dot_

 dean and stephen douglas can have a nice sit down and talk about how wonderful it is to be a diminutive blowhard on the wrong side of history _meta_end_dot_
