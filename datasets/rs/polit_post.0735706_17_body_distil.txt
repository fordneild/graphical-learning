  you ve heard that the new york philharmonic is going on tour to the hermit kingdom of north korea _meta_end_dot_

 i ll admit when the definitive news came out a couple of weeks ago i was darned surprised _meta_end_dot_

 i d heard various things about this through the grapevine since august or so and i d have bet a lot of money that it wouldn t happen _meta_end_dot_

 needless to say the politics of this are fraught and subject to a range of interpretations _meta_end_dot_

 here s some additional background and context for those of you who have never been involved in planning and executing a tour by a major performing arts organization _meta_end_dot_

 as it turns out i have read on _meta_end_dot_

 first of all the philharmonic is my big hometown band _meta_end_dot_

 i have several acquaintances and old schoolmates among the musicians and i love hearing them whenever i get the chance _meta_end_dot_

 they have a well deserved reputation as a wild bunch _meta_end_dot_

 during the tenure of music director emeritus kurt masur they overcame a serious tendency to morale problems and are now as consistent as you please _meta_end_dot_

 they re one of america s big five symphony orchestras and on any given night they can be the best in the world _meta_end_dot_

 american symphony orchestras have a distinguished history as cultural ambassadors in politically challenging settings _meta_end_dot_

 the philharmonic traveled to the soviet union in _meta_number_ref_ with then music director leonard bernstein and to israel in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 the philadelphia orchestra went to the people s republic of china in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 these tours and others like them of course were triumphs both artistically and diplomatically _meta_end_dot_

 going on an international tour is a vast undertaking for a major arts organization and this one is no different _meta_end_dot_

 the tour is being funded by credit suisse first boston among others and will run for three weeks in february _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 the original tour plans called for performances in taipei hong kong shanghai and beijing _meta_end_dot_

 music director lorin maazel has programmed mostly unadventurous repertoire consisting mostly of nineteenth century warhorses with the barber violin concerto and gershwin s an american in paris as the only exceptions _meta_end_dot_

 after the overture from the north koreans the orchestra arranged to add two additional performances to the tour one in seoul and one in pyongyang two days apart _meta_end_dot_

 the orchestra will spend two days in the north traveling on an plane chartered from a south korean airline _meta_end_dot_

 the tour consists of about _meta_number_ref_ people and about _meta_number_ref_ musical instruments some of them very large and most of them very temperamental while in the north orchestra members will give master classes and a rehearsal that will be open to professional musicians and students in addition to their concert performance _meta_end_dot_

 contrary to some reports the philharmonic will not be performing handel s messiah on tour _meta_end_dot_

 being an oratorio with large chorus and four vocal soloists the handel would have required traveling perhaps _meta_number_ref_ additional personnel _meta_end_dot_

 not bloody likely _meta_end_dot_

 philharmonic management led by president zarin mehta insisted on a set of special conditions before agreeing to perform in pyongyang _meta_end_dot_

 and yes zarin is related to conductor zubin mehta the former philharmonic music director and current music director of the israel philharmonic they re brothers the north koreans agreed to allow foreign journalists to attend the concert which means we ought to get reasonably unbiased reviews _meta_end_dot_

 the orchestra will be allowed to open their concert by playing the star spangled banner _meta_end_dot_

 importantly the koreans also agreed to broadcast the performance via live radio throughout north korea to address the concern that only an audience of hand picked political elites would hear it _meta_end_dot_

 among the private citizens and organizations who are quietly acting as sherpas in this undertaking it s noteworthy that the south koreans appear to have taken a major role _meta_end_dot_

 i ve long had the belief from talking to friends and associates from south korea that they expect the peninsula to be reunified in the next ten to fifteen years but no one is in any hurry to force the issue _meta_end_dot_

 though few will say it one suspects that kim jong il now in his mid _meta_number_ref_s will need to die first _meta_end_dot_

 americans often suspect the south koreans of coddling the northern dictator out of a lack of backbone _meta_end_dot_

 that may or may not be true _meta_end_dot_

 but it certainly is the case that no resolution to the north korean situation either in its nuclear security or its humanitarian dimensions can come without the full cooperation of people in the south _meta_end_dot_

 some americans notably john bolton have spoken out against the philharmonic s north korean adventure _meta_end_dot_

 they argue reasonably that nothing should be done to give credibility and prestige to a hostile regime at a time when our administration is engaged in delicate negotiations with them over the nuclear issue _meta_end_dot_

 but now that the tour is a done deal it s worth recalling the illustrious history of american cultural ambassadors to non free lands by way of at least looking at the bright side _meta_end_dot_

 it s far too much to hope that a tour by a symphony orchestra will end the isolation of north korea and the oppression of the north koreans by their own rulers _meta_end_dot_

 but it s worth hoping that by seeing and hearing some of the most wonderful people in america at the top of their game some north koreans will start to realize that there are other and better ways to run their country _meta_end_dot_

 and it may help them look ahead to the end of their isolation _meta_end_dot_

 to the guys and ladies i know in the new york philharmonic have a great trip play well and carry the american flag high _meta_end_exclamation_

 and i can t wait to hear your stories when you get back _meta_end_dot_
