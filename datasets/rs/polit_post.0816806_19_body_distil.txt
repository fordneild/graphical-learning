 skipping aside the decision in the third paragraph bluntly al sadr s credibility regarding being able to oppose either us or the legitimate iraqi government has taken a hit over the last few months and it doesn t seem to be keeping the latter from continuing to roll up iranian distribution networks please note how the final abandonment of a strategy that started in _meta_number_ref_ with the boycott of the iraqi elections is touted as a sweeping strategic change instead of say an abject strategic retreat but no doubt we ll have it explained soon enough why this wholesale abandoning the sadrist brand name is actually really the cleverist iraqi revolutionary tactic yet_meta_beep_ref__meta_number_ref__meta_beep_ref__meta_number_ref_ well i m personally breathless with anticipation _meta_end_dot_
