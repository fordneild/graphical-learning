  you can take or leave this post but i figured i d lay out my present thinking on this race looking at just the top candidates rudy mitt fred john and mike _meta_end_dot_

 of the five candidates all i think we can say are conservative in some way _meta_end_dot_

 rudy is whether you want to admit it or not a conservative guy _meta_end_dot_

 he s not a movement conservative and he is not socially conservative but during his time as mayor he was willing to take on the school system and the liberal interests to get government out of the way _meta_end_dot_

 in the same way that george bush is not an across the board conservative president at the end of the day his constitution if you will is conservative _meta_end_dot_

 huckabee is the same way _meta_end_dot_

 where rudy is conservative against the spread of bureaucracy and in business issues huckabee is conservative socially _meta_end_dot_

 huckabee i fear is more like bush _meta_end_dot_

 he likes the compassionate conservative label which is just social conservatism packaged in big government _meta_end_dot_

 yeah yeah you huckabee guys can defend him all you want and i personally like the guy but let s make no bones about it huckabee s support is premised on him being the religious guy the real pro life guy _meta_end_dot_

 he is in effect a social conservative and economic populist _meta_end_dot_

 his rhetoric is on fair trade not free trade he gets the mother jones crowd excited _meta_end_dot_

 i personally can t support him in the primary because i want an across the board conservative and i fear he ll drive business interests to cut a deal with hillary _meta_end_dot_

 and that leaves me with the other guys _meta_end_dot_

 rudy is fiscally conservative and socially liberal _meta_end_dot_

 huckabee is socially conservative and fiscally liberal populist _meta_end_dot_

 if you want a reagan conservative a pro life strong defense small government pro entrepreneur candidate you have to look to fred john and mitt _meta_end_dot_

 so let s look at them _meta_end_dot_

 read on _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 of the three john mccain has the longest track record _meta_end_dot_

 he is pro life _meta_end_dot_

 he is strong on defense _meta_end_dot_

 he is more or less a small government guy _meta_end_dot_

 and john mccain is a friend of the american entrepreneur _meta_end_dot_

 now you may say what about immigration well immigration is not really a liberal vs _meta_end_dot_

 conservative issue _meta_end_dot_

 the wall street journal editorial page the conservative standard bearer in the msm was in favor of it _meta_end_dot_

 human events ronald reagan s favorite newspaper was against it _meta_end_dot_

 what of campaign finance reform _meta_end_question_

 on that john mccain and i have serious disagreements _meta_end_dot_

 but he s john freakin mccain and i love the guy _meta_end_dot_

 why did chuck norris endorse mike huckabee _meta_end_question_

 because john mccain doesn t need chuck norris when he has john mccain _meta_end_dot_

 my problems with mccain however lead me to not support him in this race _meta_end_dot_

 first and no offense senator he s old _meta_end_dot_

 second he worked so far to get campaign finance reform passed his legacy issue i think he d lean toward picking judges who d uphold cfr and i think those types of judges are the types who d grow enough in office to uphold roe v _meta_end_dot_

 wade _meta_end_dot_

 third as much as i like john mccain i really really like donald rumsfeld _meta_end_dot_

 next we have mitt romney _meta_end_dot_

 he s got pretty hair _meta_end_dot_

 he s also got executive experience _meta_end_dot_

 the last hundred years indicate that a person with executive experience has the advantage _meta_end_dot_

 romney also has a lot of experience in the business world _meta_end_dot_

 to his credit he s the one guy who has been out the whole time talking about the republican foundation the stool he calls it life taxes and defense _meta_end_dot_

 let me go back to my mantra of pro life strong defense small government and pro entrepreneur _meta_end_dot_

 romney was the later _meta_end_dot_

 and he has given every indication he will be for the three former _meta_end_dot_

 he also was willing to do something with health care and did try his best to limit government involvement _meta_end_dot_

 i don t like the plan but good on him for trying _meta_end_dot_

 but this is where i left mitt months ago and where i leave him still _meta_end_dot_

 i think he s a great guy but there is a trust issue with me _meta_end_dot_

 when he needed to out gay and out abort teddy kennedy he did _meta_end_dot_

 and now he s gone the other way _meta_end_dot_

 i d like to trust him but i just have this feeling that if we are no longer convenient for him he ll turn his back on us _meta_end_dot_

 perhaps that is unfair but that s where i m at _meta_end_dot_

 i also think given the last thirty year track record candidates from massachusetts make bad candidates for president _meta_end_dot_

 i think the democrats will club mitt romney to death _meta_end_dot_

 already they are going for the flip flop label that the gop used so well against kerry _meta_end_dot_

 and voters seem to be picking up on that _meta_end_dot_

 so for me personally that leaves me with fred _meta_end_dot_

 he is pro life _meta_end_dot_

 he s got a better pro life record than mccain according to the nrlc _meta_end_dot_

 the hla may not be his priority but he huckabee and romney have all taken the same position on it _meta_end_dot_

 fred is not only pro life he recognizes it as such an important issue that he has gone further than the other candidates and expressed an intention to ensure his executive appointments believe in the culture of life _meta_end_dot_

 that s huge from a policy level _meta_end_dot_

 in fact the only part of fred that is pro abortion is the government part of him _meta_end_dot_

 fred s never met a federal expansion he didn t want to abort _meta_end_dot_

 he was frequently the lone vote in the senate against government programs _meta_end_dot_

 you and i may get tired of his federalist tourette syndrome but by god let s not deny he believes in it _meta_end_dot_

 he believes in federalism in the original sense _meta_end_dot_

 it s no surprise that he and ron paul are rated similarly by libertarian groups _meta_end_dot_

 and that s why he is also pro entreneur _meta_end_dot_

 he s big on getting government out of the way _meta_end_dot_

 fred is not a religious conservative _meta_end_dot_

 he s a leave me the heck alone conservative _meta_end_dot_

 and frankly polling shows that us evangelicals have done such a bad job combatting the media narrative against us that the _meta_number_ref_ to _meta_number_ref_ year old demographic the up and coming generation of voters has turned against us _meta_end_dot_

 it s not so much that they want gay marriage as that they don t want icky jesus freaks like me telling them what to do at the national policy setting level _meta_end_dot_

 we jesus freaks i ll embrace the term can mostly accomplish what we want to accomplish with a leave me the heck alone conservative like fred heck or even mccain _meta_end_dot_

 we can live and let live _meta_end_dot_

 and fred s a likable guy _meta_end_dot_

 so i m with him _meta_end_dot_

 and the nice thing about it for me is that i m not with fred because the others suck _meta_end_dot_

 i m with fred because i want to be _meta_end_dot_

 in a small bit of irony back in february i was attending an event in kansas at the dole institute _meta_end_dot_

 i told the director that i was supporting mitt romney but that i really wished someone like fred thompson would get in the race _meta_end_dot_

 the director agreed _meta_end_dot_

 his name is bill lacy _meta_end_dot_

 you might have heard of him _meta_end_dot_

 a good bit of me loves huckabee and rudy really excites me as a candidate against hillary _meta_end_dot_

 but i want an across the board pro life pro defense small goverment pro entrepreneur conservative _meta_end_dot_

 and of the three men who fit the bill i think fred offers the most with the least baggage _meta_end_dot_

 he ll make sure the government leaves me the heck alone _meta_end_dot_

 that s where i am _meta_end_dot_
