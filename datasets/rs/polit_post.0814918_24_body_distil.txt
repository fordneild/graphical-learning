  barack obama has not been to iraq since _meta_number_ref_ when he took a two day tour _meta_end_dot_

 in fact for all of obama s alleged globe trotting he has pretty much decided to form his foreign policy by reading the editorial page of the new york times and listening to leftists in hyde park instead of taking field trips to check out the scene for himself _meta_end_dot_

 john mccain has invited barack obama to go to iraq together _meta_end_dot_

 but no obama will not go _meta_end_dot_

 he ll gladly participate in a townhall meeting with john mccain but actually going to meet with the commanders in the field is too much _meta_end_dot_

 as jim geraghty notes obama has rejected the offer calling it a political stunt let s back up to the last paragraph he ll join mccain in townhall meetings on the campaign trail but doing so with the troops in iraq is a political stunt _meta_end_dot_

 the man who has said he would meet unconditionally with ahmadinejad will not go meet with our soldiers in iraq _meta_end_dot_

 and as jim says that s fine if he thinks it s a political stunt and he does not want to go together _meta_end_dot_

 but obama thus far has chosen to not go at all even the media s narrative on iraq has changed more than obama s _meta_end_dot_

 the surge has had a positive impact _meta_end_dot_

 the media has acknowledged as much _meta_end_dot_

 not only will obama not acknowledge that he d rather close his eyes and not see the success _meta_end_dot_

 and it s not just the troops in iraq and general petraeus that obama is refusing to meet with _meta_end_dot_

 he won t even meet with soldiers from illinois _meta_end_dot_

 a lot of the left claims to support our soldiers but not the war _meta_end_dot_

 obama apparently cannot even muster support for our soldiers and sailors _meta_end_dot_

 he s too busy planning his unconditional meetings with american enemies _meta_end_dot_
