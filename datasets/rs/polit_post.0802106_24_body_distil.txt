  for some people especially those who live and work in the district of columbia there is no aspect of life untouched by politics _meta_end_dot_

 it surrounds them like a cloud _meta_end_dot_

 this leads some of them to constant overanalysis of life pop culture and even shopping trends through the harsh lens of partisan politics _meta_end_dot_

 they tend to be the same people attracted to the constant unrelenting snark that the internet thrives on and if you said it to the subject s face is the sort of thing that in the old days would end with pistols and paces as it should be thomas yells somewhere _meta_end_dot_

 i have no idea if dana goldstein of the american prospect is one of these people _meta_end_dot_

 but her latest written work of political analysis over at tnr just goes so far over the edge of any guidelines of respect or decorum it exemplifies what happens when partisan political views warp the prism through which one views the world _meta_end_dot_

 namely baby on board accuses the mccain campaign of using his adopted daughter bridget as a political football thanks to a mailer depicting cindy mccain with baby bridget in her arms standing beside a beaming bangladeshi nun _meta_end_dot_

 read on _meta_end_dot_

 the text of the mailer reads in part in these three small sentences goldstein finds code words and symbols of the religious right and anti choice activism she goes on to take several shots at mother theresa and to actually suggest that the catholic church and pro lifers as a whole are blissfully unaware of all of the difficulties associated with adoption _meta_end_dot_

 she suggests this is all an effort at playing race based guilt politics i d suggest she take a look at what happened in new hampshire on the other side of the aisle if she wants to see racial politics at its worst _meta_end_dot_

 and she finishes up with the idea that promoting adoption of children born in the third world in worlds of terrible poverty and in bridget s case with physical disfigurement that makes one an outcast as the ugliest rhetorical practices of the pro life movement mccain has seven children in all including an older daughter meghan who is rather prominent _meta_end_dot_

 but bridget s interactions with the press have been careful and limited sensitive to her _meta_end_dot_

 in this campaign as in others she hasn t been paraded about or held up as a totem _meta_end_dot_

 and if talking to the kids at such a prominent place as scholastic makes one a political football well but let s leave that accusation to the dustbin it deserves _meta_end_dot_

 in truth it s not worth raising a response to the political hackery of dana goldstein whose pro abortion views clearly tint her view of the world _meta_end_dot_

 the response is bridget mccain herself who today is safe and healthy and loved by a family because a woman was brave enough not to merely react with hands off sympathy but to gather this frail infant up in her arms and never let her go _meta_end_dot_

 i can venture this much politics was the farthest thing from her mind at the moment she held this ten week old child in her arms _meta_end_dot_

 my little sister florence is a few years younger than bridget _meta_end_dot_

 she is thirteen and she is adopted from dc social services not exactly as daunting a task as the mccain s faced in their long struggle with the bangladeshi adoption services but still it took long days of expense and effort _meta_end_dot_

 a few months ago she got into a conversation about abortion of all things with her friends at ballet practice _meta_end_dot_

 it s the sort of thing _meta_number_ref_ and _meta_number_ref_ year old girls talk about all the time these days _meta_end_dot_

 florence without any prompting whatsoever and never having had a conversation about the issue with my parents siblings or me listened to her friends for a while _meta_end_dot_

 and then she interrupted i love my little sister _meta_end_dot_

 i love her not as a political football as a code word as a rhetorical practice i love her because of the girl she is and the woman she will be _meta_end_dot_

 and every day florence reminds me that we are loved not because of where we were born because of who raised us or because of how we grew up and that there exists within each of us a spark of the divine worthy of dignity and meant to be cherished as a gift _meta_end_dot_

 in the real world not everything in life is political _meta_end_dot_

 dana goldstein should try visiting it sometime _meta_end_dot_
