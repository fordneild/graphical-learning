  i m pretty much in agreement with josh trevino on mike huckabee _meta_end_dot_

 the criticism of him on small government grounds has solid merit alright but what of it _meta_end_question_

 we re nearing the end of two terms of big government republicanism from george w _meta_end_dot_

 bush which was basically advertised as such from the beginning and during most of which time small government criticism was muted _meta_end_dot_

 i can remember contending against no child left behind and the medicare bill years ago in the online presence of many good small government men to no avail _meta_end_dot_

 they stonefaced me _meta_end_dot_

 back in about _meta_number_ref_ i even repeated a traditional republican argument about how war according to an old saw is the health of the state the context of that _meta_number_ref_ argument might be worth revisiting to summarize i am foremost a social conservative but i have always been sympathetic to small government principles _meta_end_dot_

 i view progressive income and property taxes as morally indefensible _meta_end_dot_

 i am possessed by an undying hatred of the great society _meta_end_dot_

 i dream of dismantling entire departments of the federal government _meta_end_dot_

 a firesale of fussy bureaucrats _meta_end_exclamation_

 i regard federalism as perhaps the single greatest american contribution to republican political theory _meta_end_dot_

 etc _meta_end_dot_

 but why oh why is george w _meta_end_dot_

 bush acceptable to the fiscal conservatives while mike huckabee is fatal anathema _meta_end_question_

 why _meta_end_question_

 another point i used to make round about _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ was this it is vital for the health of the republic that right wingers unabashedly criticize president bush _meta_end_dot_

 he must feel the pressure from his right _meta_end_dot_

 we must never forget that much of his base of support is well to his right nor ever forget that the pressure from the left is exaggerated by the prejudices of the media _meta_end_dot_

 in other words we cannot lay off him simply because the left has been driven to lunacy by his mannerisms _meta_end_dot_

 failure to criticize him from the right is a kind of mirror image of bush derangement syndrome _meta_end_dot_

 and by golly the whole merit of this view was vindicated in the harriet miers debacle _meta_end_dot_

 but mostly this argument fell on deaf ears _meta_end_dot_

 until the whole horror of the thumping we republicans were about to take in _meta_number_ref_ was clear there was still a silent edict of censorship against open reproaches of the bush administration _meta_end_dot_

 i have no desire propound some similar edict on reproaches of mike huckabee _meta_end_dot_

 let the fiscal conservatives sound the tocsin _meta_end_dot_

 let the full specter of the huck a nanny state be portrayed in garish light _meta_end_dot_

 just be careful lest you remind us that the same garish light might have thrown on the governance of the last seven years to wholesome effect but largely was not _meta_end_dot_
