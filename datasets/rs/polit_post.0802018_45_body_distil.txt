  whaddya say we talk about something unrelated to the primaries _meta_end_question_

 i say we try it _meta_end_dot_

 anyone with me clear your minds of all that compelling tomfoolery and read on _meta_end_dot_

 kunstler of peak oil fame reviewed bob dylan s first volume of memoirs some time ago _meta_end_dot_

 dylan fans of whom i doubt this website has in great abundance will find in it some insight and interest though i only link to it reluctantly not least because of kunstler s penchant for profanity _meta_end_dot_

 if you don t know or like dylan or are repelled by the deliberate if rare use of oaths or vulgarity in critical writing the essay will probably just fatigue you so i ll offer just a couple summary points for your notice _meta_end_dot_

 a kunstler concludes with a statement that i endorse with two caveats the great records of the great years endure _meta_end_dot_

 the body of dylan s songwriting work is every bit as formidable as the novels of hemingway and f _meta_end_dot_

 scott fitzgerald _meta_end_dot_

 i have no doubt that dylan will go down as the most important artist of my generation now the natural reaction to a statement like that about the sixties generation is a terse that aint saying much brother muttered under the breath _meta_end_dot_

 that is my first caveat _meta_end_dot_

 the second is of course that dylan is not of my generation but the preceding one _meta_end_dot_

 nevertheless in my view dylan s stature is assured _meta_end_dot_

 whether the genre of rock n rock which he pioneered mastered expanded and bewildered will secure a similar stature in the tableau of human art is another question altogether one on which i must confess my own agnosticism _meta_end_dot_

 now kunstler while clearly a connoisseur of exaggerated polemic take a gander at his headline blog the title of which i will not reproduce here if you doubt that is not a writer particularly given to exaggerated encomia _meta_end_dot_

 he is not a writer given to the instrument of flattery _meta_end_dot_

 though i deny and censure the liberalism that underlies it i do admire his honesty _meta_end_dot_

 all that is merely by way of restating that his bold conclusion on dylan is probably not just another instance of boomer enthusiasm and self absorption _meta_end_dot_

 which brings me to my second point b kunstler confirms what was only a rumor to me before that dylan records in this volume of memoirs that his favorite politician in the sixties was none other than mr _meta_end_dot_

 conservative himself barry goldwater _meta_end_dot_

 let that sink in _meta_end_dot_

 it is hardly a revelation to learn that dylan has rebuffed most attempts to award him the title spokesman of a generation or that he has generally resisted granting his protest songs over to leftist iconography _meta_end_dot_

 but it does come with some surprise to discover that his actual political tendencies in the _meta_number_ref_s were toward a politician like goldwater _meta_end_dot_

 kunstler certainly does not neglect to emphasize his astonishment and he is plainly a man of the left _meta_end_dot_

 c with all this is mind i am prepared to offer a qualified conservative endorsement of dylan given that the counterculture of the sixties which tried to set up dylan as its spokesman or poet laureate has conquered and is even now solidifying its preeminence in our society there is a special and marvelous irony to note _meta_end_dot_

 all the sneering revolt that churns through the great anthems of dylan s best work like a rolling stone being perhaps the most well known exemplar all the defiance the fury of impudence all the challenge thrown vaguely at some contemptible oppressor you used to be so amused go to him now he calls you you can t refuse you re invisible now you got no secrets to conceal _meta_end_dot_

 how does it feel _meta_end_question_

 to be on your own like a complete unknown all this may be justly hurled with equal passion against the generation now leading our country toward ruin which wanted it as its slogan and which unjustly hurled it against the basically sound social order preceding it _meta_end_dot_

 and bob dylan himself may have even meant it that way _meta_end_dot_

 _______________ let me also take a moment to point you to a website called right wing bob whose proprietor recently interviewed j _meta_end_dot_

 bottum editor of first things on the subject of bob dylan _meta_end_dot_

 ben stein was another interviewee some time back _meta_end_dot_
