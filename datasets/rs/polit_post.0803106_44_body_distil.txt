  a number of conservative pundits and bloggers who aren t busy leaving the party have asked demanded that sen _meta_end_dot_

 mccain make overtures to conservatives to help unite the party _meta_end_dot_

 i think this is good advice and it has been made by supporters as well as antagonists of the senator _meta_end_dot_

 what has been missed in this often repeated advice is that senator mccain has been campaigning as a conservative on the vast majority of issues _meta_end_dot_

 below the fold the senator s words abortion taxes spending pork and i won t waste the space putting the senator s words on the war here as they are well known _meta_end_dot_

 finally i will say that as someone who has seen the senator campaign in nh and sc during the primary season i think anyone who doesn t follow politics closely would find mccain to be a conservative _meta_end_dot_

 the senator talks passionately about the problem of pork barrel corruption special interests in washington and over spending _meta_end_dot_

 he also talks passionately about the war our troops and the need to defeat islamic terrorism around the world _meta_end_dot_

 although he did not speak about abortion as much he was the only candidate besides paul to send remarks to the march for life and his abortion statements above are as pro life as anything a republican president has said in my lifetime _meta_end_dot_

 finally at rallies he talks about judges and says he wants clones of alito and roberts the senator should do more to make sure conservatives know that he is an ally _meta_end_dot_

 hopefully cpac will give him that opportunity _meta_end_dot_

 but the senator has already been extending an olive branch _meta_end_dot_

 uniting the party is primarily the senator s job but conservatives have to honestly listen and give him a chance _meta_end_dot_

 otherwise there is no reason to reach out in the first place _meta_end_dot_
