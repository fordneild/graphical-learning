  tomorrow is the biggest and most important single state republican primary in the republican field a winner take all contest for florida s delegates _meta_end_dot_

 john mccain is locked in a struggle to the death with mitt romney and a quickly fading rudy giuliani _meta_end_dot_

 and right now it seems that the race as a whole may come down to a single phrase tucked away in a place of relative unimportance the _meta_number_ref_th paragraph in a john fund article to wit it seems likely from the structure of mr _meta_end_dot_

 fund s article that he did not realize how this statement would explode like a bombshell with the conservative base _meta_end_dot_

 after the acrimonious fight over miers and the equally acrimonious confirmation fight over alito it is safe to say that the confirmation of samuel alito to the supreme court is regarded by many voting conservatives as the most significant conservative victory of the last three or four years _meta_end_dot_

 if john mccain had repudiated the decision to nominate alito because he was visibly conservative he would have intentionally planted a dynamite charge in the weakest portion of his own base conservatives who had recently talked themselves into rolling the dice on his judicial nominations and detonated the charge _meta_end_dot_

 it would have shown an absolute deafness towards the central concern of the voters mccain is trying hardest at this moment to court _meta_end_dot_

 someone in the mccain camp understood and the campaign led by the candidate quickly issued blanket denials leading some including myself to question john fund s anonymous sources _meta_end_dot_

 i called upon fund to respond and he has he is sticking with his story and claims that he has multiple sources to back it up _meta_end_dot_

 he is adamant that the sources said that mccain might not have appointed alito as opposed to would not have appointed alito a nuance i missed in my earlier piece but this effectively amounts to the same thing in conservatives minds _meta_end_dot_

 further on a blogger conference call mccain seemed to walk back a bit from his earlier denial _meta_end_dot_

 if fund does in fact come forward with sources who can substantiate this conversation i think this remark finishes john mccain in the long run _meta_end_dot_

 it is a perfect soundbite made for commericals and as i said it hits mccain where he is most vulnerable with conservatives _meta_end_dot_

 further for him to have made such a remark with a crucial florida primary right around the corner would speak to the fact that even with a zillion advisers constantly around him he really just does not understand the issues that are of importance to conservatives and he is not willing to meet us on our terms _meta_end_dot_

 you all know that i m a romney guy so feel free to take this with a grain of salt _meta_end_dot_

 i m still willing to give mccain the benefit of the doubt on what was said but if fund turns out to have been right i will have great difficulty supporting him even in the general for whatever that is worth _meta_end_dot_
