  i know that many a soul thinks and likes to think that the retirement of centcom commander admiral william fallon from the navy means that we are about to go to war with iran but fred kaplan does a good job of pouring cold water all over that idea _meta_end_dot_

 and while there is a great deal of talk about how the firing just means that yet another bush administration critic was silenced the fact is that if there was a firing fallon pretty much had it coming _meta_end_dot_

 quoth kaplan max boot puts the _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 er _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 boot in _meta_end_dot_

 i d excerpt but you should really read the whole thing _meta_end_dot_

 of course whether or not you believe that fallon s retirement was purely voluntary it should be noted anew that this story is the one that really got the ball rolling _meta_end_dot_

 it is utterly fawning when it comes to its coverage of fallon and fallon aids the cause by making statements that positively reeked of insubordination _meta_end_dot_

 oh and note the shot in the story that tom barnett took at general petraeus _meta_end_dot_

 it was totally gratuitous and it only served to embarrass barnett given the facts concerning the surge _meta_end_dot_

 it embarrassed fallon as well since he was always skeptical of the surge _meta_end_dot_

 here s hoping that the next centcom commander decides to work with general petraeus rather than serve as the inspiration for stories about how centcom is at odds with the commander of the multinational force in iraq _meta_end_dot_

 i appreciate fallon s service to the country _meta_end_dot_

 he served for over four decades an awesome achievement _meta_end_dot_

 for that he deserves accolades and kudos _meta_end_dot_

 but there is a reason why control of the military is left in the hands of the civilians and fallon failed to grasp that in many of his interactions with the press _meta_end_dot_

 by failing to grasp the success of the surge as well fallon unfortunately may have greased his own skids _meta_end_dot_

 he should have supported a winning strategy instead of spending time and energy trashing it either passively or actively _meta_end_dot_
