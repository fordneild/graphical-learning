  i m not a doom and gloomer like some of my colleagues _meta_end_dot_

 at this point i have more faith in reading the entrails of a goat than i do either on polls or intrade futures _meta_end_dot_

 but i am very worried _meta_end_dot_

 i m worried for two reasons _meta_end_dot_

 first i don t believe a lot of people are taking obama seriously they think we have dodged the bullet now that hillary clinton no longer actively campaigning _meta_end_dot_

 secondly i ve seen this before _meta_end_dot_

 i haven t technically slipped into geezerhood but i ve been around as an adult for a while _meta_end_dot_

 my first presidential vote was for jimmy carter _meta_end_dot_

 but this isn t about my bad judgment as a college student _meta_end_dot_

 this is about _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 read on _meta_end_dot_

 during the _meta_number_ref_ presidential campaign i was an active duty army officer assigned to the army staff but detailed as military aide to an assistant secretary in one of the civilian agencies _meta_end_dot_

 my boss was a political appointee _meta_end_dot_

 my contemporaries in the immediate office of the assistant secretary were also all political appointees _meta_end_dot_

 their jobs were dependent on ghw bush winning the election and though they couldn t campaign for him and as far as i know they didn t i did come into daily contact with all manner of folks who were very active in gop politics and the campaign of bush p re _meta_end_dot_

 so other than reading the papers i was pretty conversant in the campaign strategy and gossip _meta_end_dot_

 there were two main themes present during the campaign experience deficit _meta_end_dot_

 lagging popularity but when viewed in the context of his entire presidency even discounting the gulf war boost this was an anomaly _meta_end_dot_

 he d successfully or so it seemed at the time negotiated the dissolution of the warsaw pact and the breakup of the soviet union _meta_end_dot_

 his campaign could not believe that america would toss the most highly r sum ed president of all time for an obvious lightweight _meta_end_dot_

 character deficit unlike today _meta_number_ref_ was still close enough to the vietnam war and a large population of live ww ii vets that draft dodger was thought to be a killer _meta_end_dot_

 ghw bush was the youngest commissioned aviator he received his commission and wings at age _meta_number_ref_ in the us navy in ww ii and a combat veteran _meta_end_dot_

 anyone who thinks bill clinton s horndoggedness was suddenly revealed after he was elected is simply delusional _meta_end_dot_

 clinton s serial philandering was well known to the bush camp during the campaign _meta_end_dot_

 when clinton was chairman of the national association of governors a group of his fellow governors pulled him aside at one of their conventions at counselled him to stop his relentless and public pursuit of everything that was even vaguely female _meta_end_dot_

 his little rock exploits were well known _meta_end_dot_

 and i heard convincing to the point that i am still convinced the hillary while not quite as heroic in her extracurriculars as bill was certainly not suffering in silence _meta_end_dot_

 against this was devoted husband and father _meta_end_dot_

 the seriousness with which the clinton campaign took this threat is best demonstrated in the shameless way in which that campaign flogged the jennifer fizgerald story bill clinton was a deeply flawed man and contrary to many i look at his presidency and i see much more of a combinations animal house and holiday from history than i see evidence of some immense political talent _meta_end_dot_

 having said that the bush campaign had its own flaws _meta_end_dot_

 abandoned by the base it s mine lack of fire al gore inspired willie horton ad that he refused to allow any attacks on clinton s personal life _meta_end_dot_

 whatever _meta_end_dot_

 politics as they say ain t beanbag _meta_end_dot_

 of course there is a huge difference _meta_end_dot_

 ross perot is not running and in _meta_number_ref_ ross perot earned a place somewhere in the ninth circle of hell for bringing eight years of darkness on this country _meta_end_dot_

 contrary to what paultards believe ron paul really isn t as attractive smart interesting or substantial as ross perot _meta_end_dot_

 the similarities here are stunningly obvious _meta_end_dot_

 right now a lot of conservatives are gleeful over an obama candidacy _meta_end_dot_

 they believe that america will see obama as they do _meta_end_dot_

 a lightweight in fact if we assume his public statements actually reflect his intellect he has to rate somewhere between pinhead and zero gravity _meta_end_dot_

 inexperienced _meta_end_dot_

 a poseur _meta_end_dot_

 most likely a crook _meta_end_dot_

 insincere _meta_end_dot_

 all in all he has nothing in his character or experience to recommend him for the presidency _meta_end_dot_

 his chicago background given his association with convicted felon tony rezko is much what we d expect of a chicago machine pol _meta_end_dot_

 his association with convicted terrorists william ayers and bernadine dohrn should be campaign killers as should his long and intimate association with a series of racist ministers _meta_end_dot_

 obama is not only unqualified he is a weak candidate _meta_end_dot_

 that being said mccain goes into the election with a base that is effectively alienated from him _meta_end_dot_

 unlike bush_meta_number_ref_ this is not the result of a single instance crystallizing latent suspicions _meta_end_dot_

 mccain has made a career of actively jamming his thumbs into the eyes of the conservative movement just for the fun of doing it _meta_end_dot_

 though i will vote for him in november i m not really sure i d cross the the street to pee on him if he were on fire _meta_end_dot_

 his campaign seems to think they can create history in _meta_number_ref_ by beating their opponent on the issues _meta_end_dot_

 good luck _meta_end_dot_

 if we go back through the recent elections we find they were decided not on issues but on metaphors _meta_end_dot_

 kerry windsurfing _meta_end_dot_

 al gore inventing the internet _meta_end_dot_

 bob dole falling off the stage _meta_end_dot_

 the man from hope _meta_end_dot_

 dukakis in a tank _meta_end_dot_

 etc _meta_end_dot_

 for those who think issues actually matter i d remind them that obama has carried the democrat primary the election where people who actually care about politics and policy vote in disproportionate numbers compared with the short bus general election on nothing more substantive than being an attractive black candidate mouthing fairly nebulous rhetoric promising hopechange _meta_end_dot_

 the mccain camp has decided maybe rightly that if they go after obama on anything other than his policy positions they will be accused of racism _meta_end_dot_

 i have news for them _meta_end_dot_

 they are going to be accused of racism and the sooner they man up and deal with that the better off they will be _meta_end_dot_

 even if the low risk strategy for mccain in dealing with the inevitable charges of racism is to only deal with policy differences somebody has to do the heavy lifting _meta_end_dot_

 the reverend wright is an issue that can strip away all but the most liberal white voters from obama _meta_end_dot_

 ayers is an issue _meta_end_dot_

 rezko is an issue _meta_end_dot_

 his quote a matic wife is a potential issue _meta_end_dot_

 but they are only issues if mccain lets them be _meta_end_dot_

 people don t form _meta_number_ref_s and give lots of money if they become social pariahs on their own side _meta_end_dot_

 they expect to be disavowed but they also expect the wink and nod _meta_end_dot_

 there is no evidence that mccain will do that _meta_end_dot_

 in fact when you look at mccain s experience in south carolina in _meta_number_ref_ his reaction was not to fight back against some rather scurrilous rumors but to play achilles and go off to his tent to sulk _meta_end_dot_

 where he s been for eight years _meta_end_dot_

 obama is imminently beatable and if elected promises to be an unmitigated failure _meta_end_dot_

 all that aside there is little evidence that the mccain campaign realizes their own weak position or is mentally tough enough to do what it takes to win _meta_end_dot_
