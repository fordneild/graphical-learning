  update the actual story also includes a new report that aust a n oops double oops goolsbee obama s economics guy met with the canadian consulate in chicago _meta_end_dot_

 this is not replacing the existing narrative merely supplementing it they continue to claim that they have a source inside the canadian embassy _meta_end_dot_

 interesting and note that the response to the goolsbee allegation was apparently no comment _meta_end_dot_

 moe lane taylor marsh who by the way is no doubt happily bemused that she s getting links from the right that aren t mean at all gives us the latest volley in what is promising to be increasingly less an american political story and more a canadian one you can get up to speed here essentially ctv reported that senator obama s campaign and possibly senator clinton s for those steaming about it called up the canadian ambassador to reassure canada that no they weren t going to junk nafta after all _meta_end_dot_

 just politics in other words _meta_end_dot_

 the canadian embassy has denied it so has both campaigns but ctv has not withdrawn the story and has pretty much declared that the canadian government is lying about this in order to avoid looking like it s interfering in a foreign election _meta_end_dot_

 they have not revealed their source but have declared that they have reconfirmed the story _meta_end_dot_

 yes see what i mean _meta_end_question_

 we ll forget this in a day or two the canadians might not _meta_end_dot_

 read on _meta_end_dot_

 the problem here is that ctv s version of the story is plausible but essentially impossible to confirm without revealing the source _meta_end_dot_

 walking through the plausible part first it is hardly inconceivable to think that a political campaign might choose to well lie about its agenda in order to shore up hot button votes _meta_end_dot_

 those wishing to argue this point should meditate on iowa and the way that both parties seem to be on a four year cycle regarding the promotion of ethanol fuels _meta_end_dot_

 nafta is a similarly hot button issue in ohio at least among democratic voters _meta_end_dot_

 it is also hardly inconceivable that a campaign might decide that they should pass a quiet word of reassurance along _meta_end_dot_

 true it would be stupid of them to do so as this story is currently demonstrating but there s no rule that a campaign has to be smart _meta_end_dot_

 lastly ctv s suggestion as to why the canadian embassy is denying the story has one thing going for it the canadian government does not want to look like it s interfering in an american election _meta_end_dot_

 neither our electorate nor theirs is likely to approve and while it won t end in a war it will cause headaches _meta_end_dot_

 so plausible but impossible to prove and that s a problem for a news agency _meta_end_dot_

 personally i see no reason why ctv shouldn t reveal its source given that it essentially started this whole story and there s likely to be no classified information involved if there had been classified information involved i of course would have not agreed with them running the story in the first place _meta_end_dot_

 in fact if they do then they ve got the makings of a fine ratings increased scandal one that again we ll stop noticing by next week but one that should keep canadians interested all spring _meta_end_dot_

 if they won t reveal the source then they should retract the story these have become serious charges which means that they require serious evidence _meta_end_dot_

 and i say this confident that various individuals will wholeheartedly agree with me _meta_end_dot_

 a pity that more of them won t take the point that they should be doing the same thing when it s say the new york times doing it but then i stopped expecting internal consistency from our opposite numbers roughly four years ago _meta_end_dot_
