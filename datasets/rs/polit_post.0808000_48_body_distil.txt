  no big surprise that sen _meta_end_dot_

 obama s refusal to explain why he put his family in front of such vile rhetoric and linked himself to such a divisive church has hurt him in the polls _meta_end_dot_

 even kos is acknowledging that the revelation that sen _meta_end_dot_

 obama has spent two decades associating himself with a spiritual mentor who hates america and white people is not the best way to win friends and influence people _meta_end_dot_

 specifically the rcp average now shows clinton as more competitive against mccain than obama although mccain leads both within the moe _meta_end_dot_

 read on _meta_end_dot_

 update note that some numbers were wrong in the original post and have been fixed _meta_end_dot_

 although some commentators are being distracted by a generally good speech by sen _meta_end_dot_

 obama on race yesterday pundits shouldn t lose sight of the real problem for obama here _meta_end_dot_

 sen _meta_end_dot_

 obama ran as someone who can transcend race and take the country into the future of race relations _meta_end_dot_

 for most americans that means moving toward a more colorblind future where people are judged as individuals not by the color of their skin _meta_end_dot_

 and for most americans the next phase of race relations is one where people with rev _meta_end_dot_

 wright s views are considered as vile as the kkk _meta_end_dot_

 racial anger and hatred against any group is to be shunned _meta_end_dot_

 thus sen _meta_end_dot_

 obama s choice to associate with learn from and defend rev _meta_end_dot_

 wright is a very risky decision _meta_end_dot_

 sen _meta_end_dot_

 obama s decision to take his children to a church where racial hatred is part of the sermon will make many independents and moderates uncomfortable _meta_end_dot_

 and it may be a big chink in obama s message of unity and reconciliation _meta_end_dot_

 sen _meta_end_dot_

 obama still has not answered the important and hard questions _meta_end_dot_

 why did he choose to go to a church where a race baiter was in charge _meta_end_question_

 why did he not leave when he learned of these noxious views _meta_end_question_

 why should we trust him to heal the nation s racial wounds when he won t stand up against the remnants of black racism _meta_end_question_

 how can we trust someone who would put his children in front of this man and call him a spiritual mentor obama avoided these questions in his speech _meta_end_dot_

 will the media buy the head fake or will they continue asking the hard questions _meta_end_question_

 will they become an snl skit and give obama a pass they would never give if a republican or democrat choose to be part of a church where the pastor peddled racial anger against blacks _meta_end_question_

 regardless obama s image has been hit and the mr _meta_end_dot_

 perfect feeling is gone _meta_end_dot_

 we are about to learn how much of obama s appeal was from being perfect and how much was due to his views and experience _meta_end_dot_
