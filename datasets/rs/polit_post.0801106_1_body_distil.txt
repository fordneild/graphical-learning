  while we re on the subject of presidential politics take a look at taiwan _meta_end_dot_

 they re staging a parliamentary election tomorrow and a presidential election on march _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 for a clue to the stakes in the contests check this out i don t know who professor yang is or who he speaks for but this is not the first time i ve heard this sentiment from a taiwanese _meta_end_dot_

 and just in time for the summer olympics _meta_end_dot_

 you need to know more about this so read on _meta_end_dot_

 taiwan s opposition party is called the kuomintang _meta_end_dot_

 yes that kuomintang the party of sun yat sen _meta_end_dot_

 they were unable to hold on in mainland china in the late _meta_number_ref_s and through sheer ineptitude allowed the maoists to come to power _meta_end_dot_

 the kmt are currently the majority party in taiwan s legislature while the presidency has been held by the democratic progressive party since _meta_number_ref_ resulting in a divided government that reportedly has come to grate on the taiwanese _meta_end_dot_

 the kmt anticipate strengthening their legislative majority on saturday and they expect their leader ma ying jeou to be elected president in march _meta_end_dot_

 here s what a different professor yang has to say about that one of the key planks of the kuomintang platform is and has long been eventual reunification with mainland china _meta_end_dot_

 in practical terms that means strengthened economic ties and eventually a political rapprochement with the prc _meta_end_dot_

 taiwan along with japan is today one of the most important exporters to china supplying high technology components that mainlanders assemble into finished goods the dpp party which currently holds the presidency has always stood for taiwanese independence and expanded diplomatic relations with other nations _meta_end_dot_

 in regard to the latter ambition they have been continually thwarted by the prc obviously and by the united states probably because we don t want to honk off the chicoms _meta_end_dot_

 from conversations with people who have been to taiwan i ve long been of the opinion that the island s eventual reunion with the mainland would come about voluntarily _meta_end_dot_

 among other things that means there will be little or no scope for an american military response _meta_end_dot_

 reunification will end up being portrayed as a normalization rather than as the takeover of a free nation _meta_end_dot_

 if these elections go as expected look for the opening moves of a global pr campaign from china regarding taiwan _meta_end_dot_

 they could come in the form of television commercials broadcast during this summer s olympic games _meta_end_dot_

 expect to see gorgeous little girls with shining eyes and bright national costumes as the english language voiceover tells you how anxiously they yearn to meet their great grandparents in families that have been tragically and needlessly split apart for three generations now _meta_end_dot_

 it s abundantly evident that the taiwanese love freedom _meta_end_dot_

 they have also benefited mightily from it to the tune of a _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ per capita gdp is that going to get thrown out the window _meta_end_question_

 i don t know enough to say _meta_end_dot_

 but the taiwanese people are now being presented with two very clear opportunities to decide and to tell the world whether they wish to tighten their ties to china even if it ultimately means they will lose their freedom _meta_end_dot_

 this pair of elections could even be more important than the south carolina primary _meta_end_dot_
