  to summarize this a florida education union is threatening to sue to shut down a school choice program in the state if the program expands _meta_end_dot_

 they have already successfully sued to shut down a previous voucher program in the state _meta_end_dot_

 basically if too many families opt for school choice the nuclear litigation weapons will be launched by the union which is bound and determined that floridian children be taught their way as opposed to being taught the best way _meta_end_dot_

 remember all of this the next time you hear educational unions tell you that they only want what is best for your children _meta_end_dot_

 poppycock _meta_end_dot_

 they only want what is best for the unions political power and for the job security of union members _meta_end_dot_
