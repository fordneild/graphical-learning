  as brother lane has noted barack obama s economic adviser austan goolsbee was evidently the one who talked to the canadians in the negotiating room with the signed nafta treaty as a conversational piece _meta_end_dot_

 this beats having professor plum kill someone in the drawing room with a candlestick and in the event that anyone tries to make professor goolsbee into a villain in this entire affair or someone engaged in diplomatic skulduggery let me opine that to the contrary goolsbee comes out of this entire matter smelling like a rose _meta_end_dot_

 and rightfully so _meta_end_dot_

 at the very least he tried to make it clear to the canadians that nafta would remain a going concern despite obama s rhetoric on the campaign trail _meta_end_dot_

 this is a good thing absent goolsbee s intervention the canadians may have been convinced that an obama administration was going to ditch or renegotiate nafta and if they were so convinced the canadian government may have taken measures that we would not have liked them to take such as altering the deal the united states has regarding canadian oil _meta_end_dot_

 pray they don t alter it further so kudos to goolsbee who acted responsibly in this matter _meta_end_dot_

 unfortunately his candidate did not follow suit _meta_end_dot_

 whatever else you can say about john mccain he was and is willing to take on his base regarding issues he cares about campaign finance reform and climate change proposals and he is willing to refuse to cater to the electorate at large regarding another issue he cares about iraq _meta_end_dot_

 would that barack obama showed the same brand of courage _meta_end_dot_

 but this post partisan candidate is very partisan indeed when it comes to being responsive to the whims of the democratic base _meta_end_dot_

 and if as brother adam makes clear that means trashing one of the best ways to enhance american economic power well so be it _meta_end_dot_

 anything for a vote _meta_end_dot_
