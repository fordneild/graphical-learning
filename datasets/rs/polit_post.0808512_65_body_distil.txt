  on the same day when the new york times heaps love on the corrupt criminal pervert who once was their beloved governor they blame president bush for things beyond a president s control _meta_end_dot_

 from the spitzer editorial yeah they did it for like bill clinton of recent memory now it s eliot spitzer s turn to receive credit from the nyt for things which never happened or spitzer did not himself do _meta_end_dot_

 meanwhile in another of today s editorials the doltish souls on that editorial board preach that our dependency on foreign oil is the fault of president bush they say that the white house is run by oilmen and they insinuate that the purpose of this administration was to protect oilmen from the dangers of cape cod wind farms _meta_end_dot_

 no that s teddy kennedy you sillies they expect that their readers some of whom are intelligent and or decently educated will follow these puerile arguments and agree gol those times guys are so smart oracle at delphia _meta_end_dot_

 yep boy howdy i sure agree with those observations read on by all and by any means _meta_end_dot_

 the editorial team of the new york times has become rare and in some ways a perverse ideal _meta_end_dot_

 if we could assemble history s finest parodists they could create no better send up than the actual words of the times editorial board _meta_end_dot_

 they are an ideal example of self parody and one leading to inevitable self destruction at that _meta_end_dot_

 they discuss additional examples of spitzer s perfidy and corruption then boast that he at least tried to make wall street a safer place for the little guy who s the little guy and how is wall street safer for him if it were unsafe in the first place _meta_end_question_

 they explain that oil prices are high because bush tanked the u s _meta_end_dot_

 stock market so investors buy oil commodities instead _meta_end_dot_

 i m not an expert on such things but i do know that gas prices went through most of their increases while the stock market was setting record highs _meta_end_dot_

 how does one follow and buy into this dross _meta_end_question_

 but that s the nyt editorial board _meta_end_dot_

 the people most influenced by the wisdumb of the editorial board are the news reporters who dutifully reflect the board s careless vapidity in their political news stories _meta_end_dot_

 it is as if all times employees are components of the borg set by its creators to self destruct with dying silly wails _meta_end_dot_
