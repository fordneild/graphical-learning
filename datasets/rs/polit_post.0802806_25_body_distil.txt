  the obama campaign has gotten itself a big time endorsement from senator edward kennedy an endorsement that constitutes a huge blow to the clinton campaign especially given the fact that the clintons positioned themselves as the inheritors of the kennedy legacy back in the _meta_number_ref_s _meta_end_dot_

 i guess that pictures don t possess the sentimental value that they once had _meta_end_dot_

 but let us remember that super duper tuesday will be a tough fight to say the least _meta_end_dot_

 and just as i expected hillary clinton to rise from the dead after obama s big win in iowa so do i expect her to rise from the dead on super duper tuesday _meta_end_dot_

 that doesn t mean that obama also will not do well _meta_end_dot_

 but it will likely mean that hillary clinton will keep herself in the game as a viable and formidable contender for the democratic presidential nomination _meta_end_dot_

 at the end of the day i still expect her to be the nominee _meta_end_dot_

 it is just clear that the path to the nomination will be a trying and a bloody one _meta_end_dot_

 and who is to say how motivated independents and obama democrats will be to come out and vote for her in the fall especially given the shenanigans in which the clintons have been involved as they seek desperately to stop barack obama _meta_end_question_
