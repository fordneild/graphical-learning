  more times than i can count andrew sullivan has argued that any long term conflagration that occurs in the middle east as a result of the removal of saddam hussein s regime in iraq is and should be traceable to the decisions that president bush made in removing saddam from power _meta_end_dot_

 thus if the middle east goes to hell in a handbasket president bush is to blame _meta_end_dot_

 as just one example of this kind of argument see this post where sullivan argues that thanks to the bush administration s decision to remove saddam w e have not constructed a democratic model for the middle east we have instead destroyed a totalitarian government and a phony country only to create a permanently unstable fractious chaotic failed state where the mere avoidance of genocide is a cause for celebration _meta_end_dot_

 we have moreover helped solder a new truth in the arab mind that democracy means chaos anarchy mass murder national disintegration and sectarian warfare presumably this state of affairs will last for quite a while into the future if not for generations in any event the near permanent nature of this state of affairs is more than implicit in sullivan s rhetoric and if it does president bush will be at fault for it _meta_end_dot_

 today sullivan responds to a post by ross douthat which states the following this is sullivan s excerpt emphasis mine so if things turn out badly bush is responsible _meta_end_dot_

 if things turn out well in the end then bush s decisions are close to meaningless and remove all proximate responsibility for those making them just let the nature of this new intellectually shallow argument motivated purely by convenience and animus on sullivan s part sink in _meta_end_dot_

 doesn t he check his own archives _meta_end_question_

 and isn t he embarrassed by the way in which he blatantly contradicts his own arguments for the sake of animus and animus alone _meta_end_question_
