  the prospects for a brokered convention on the democratic side are growing _meta_end_dot_

 howard dean says that the party is gonna have to get the candidates together and make some kind of arrangement because i don t think we can afford to have a brokered convention if the nominee is not determined by march or april of this year _meta_end_dot_

 how mak ing some kind of arrangement is different from having a brokered convention is anyone s guess _meta_end_dot_

 meanwhile there is deep concern that superdelegates may be called on to decide the issue with democrats like donna brazile warning that they will quit the party if that happens _meta_end_dot_

 of course republicans salivate at the possibility that the democratic party might be split asunder thanks to partisans being angry about superdelegates deciding the issue _meta_end_dot_

 this would have maximum destructive possibilities if barack obama was slightly ahead in the delegate count but short of a majority and then got overtaken by the votes of the superdelegates _meta_end_dot_
