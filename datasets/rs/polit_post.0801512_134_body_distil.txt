  i m on the radio this morning _meta_end_dot_

 for the last thirty minutes i ve been talking about the clinton v _meta_end_dot_

 obama race war _meta_end_dot_

 this isn t a new topic but something very interesting happened _meta_end_dot_

 mayor c _meta_end_dot_

 jack ellis the recently term limited out of office mayor of macon ga called in the show _meta_end_dot_

 mayor ellis was the first black mayor of this racially charged city _meta_end_dot_

 and he is hopping mad at the clintons _meta_end_dot_

 so mad in fact he s off to south carolina to help organize the vote for barack obama _meta_end_dot_

 he said this morning that the african american community stood by the clintons through eight years of everyone else abandoning them _meta_end_dot_

 after all and this is me not him they took the sister souljah moment they took welfare reform _meta_end_dot_

 hell they took ginsberg and breyer _meta_end_dot_

 how did the clintons pay them back _meta_end_question_

 they didn t _meta_end_dot_

 mayor ellis also turned on bob johnson the former head and founder of black entertainment television bet _meta_end_dot_

 as the mayor pointed out bob johnson ran some of the most disgusting music videos and things on television polluting the african american community _meta_end_dot_

 then according to the mayor he sold it off to cbs after corrupting the community _meta_end_dot_

 there is a real undercurrent of angry sentiment against the clintons _meta_end_dot_

 mayor ellis reflects it _meta_end_dot_

 i ll say against what i ve said before the clintons are not good politicians _meta_end_dot_

 under bill the democrats lost the house lost the senate lost the majority of state legislatures and lost the majority of governors mansions _meta_end_dot_

 the clintons are just good self promoters and the chickens are starting to come home to roost _meta_end_dot_
