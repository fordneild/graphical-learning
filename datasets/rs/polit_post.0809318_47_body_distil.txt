  unfortunately i don t have time enough right now to give these thoughts the treatment i think they deserve _meta_end_dot_

 the importunate urgency in our age is very strong it militates against my inclination to let them marinate for awhile in the hopes that a structured essay may issue from the marinade _meta_end_dot_

 in short i m going to just throw these two thoughts out there and affix a french word to the title to make them look grand and important _meta_end_dot_

 read on _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ i wonder if there is a lesson in the rev _meta_end_dot_

 wright contretemps for our dear creedal patriots _meta_end_dot_

 now creedal patriots to review are those given to stressing the idealism and nobility of the american creed as the ground of american patriotism _meta_end_dot_

 against them in solemn but fraternal dispute stand those like me whose judgment it is that these creedal aspects of american patriotism have been exaggerated to our detriment _meta_end_dot_

 did you notice the method by which senator obama sought to dodge the blow aimed for him with the appearance of all those sermon tapes tapes which mind you implicated him in a preacher who teaches the bloodguilt of america _meta_end_question_

 did you catch the particular form of his sophistry _meta_end_question_

 senator obama s pastor for many years urged that in justice america ought to be thrown down like any common despotism _meta_end_dot_

 when some wicked men attempted this foul work he spoke of chickens coming home to roost _meta_end_dot_

 but there is according to him nothing common about america s sins _meta_end_dot_

 they are so egregious as to render loyalty impossible _meta_end_dot_

 his indictment is a staggering document discursive too be sure but hardly obscure in implication _meta_end_dot_

 god damn america _meta_end_dot_

 her guilt is indelible _meta_end_dot_

 her judgment is coming and no avenue of redemption is open to her _meta_end_dot_

 there is some reassurance in the fact that whatever else senator obama s speech did it certainly presented an avenue of redemption _meta_end_dot_

 he denied that the guilt is indelible _meta_end_dot_

 he spoke movingly of the possibility that america may indeed better approximate that more perfect union spoken of in the preamble to the constitution _meta_end_dot_

 the profound mistake of reverend wright s sermons obama told us was that alas he spoke as if our society was static as if no progress has been made ah yes our old friend progress _meta_end_dot_

 loyalty to america becomes loyalty to her progress toward proffered goals _meta_end_dot_

 in fine obama is a creedalist in his patriotism and he may have we cannot yet know evaded a crippling political blow by means of the vulnerabilities of this theory _meta_end_dot_

 put another way obama managed to escape the fact that he and his family have sat under the teaching authority of an openly anti american preacher by means of an appeal to the ideals of america _meta_end_dot_

 my question for the creedal patriots is this if your doctrine can be employed to inoculate against even rank anti americanism might there not be some flaws in it meriting attention _meta_end_question_

 if a politician can appeal to american ideals in order to cover up even this a brazen repudiation of patriotism how secure can this theory of patriotism be _meta_end_question_

 _meta_number_ref_ now and then in the course of this debate which i do hope will remain fraternal and fruitful someone arguing against non creedal patriots like myself will deliver themselves of a certain type of sneer or dismissal _meta_end_dot_

 one prominent columnist in a moment of weakness put is thusly when you say you love america you re not saying our mud is better than the other guy s mud but as a pulverizing fact in the great bulk of our patriotic songs we are saying something very much like that though not with the note of supremacy indicated by better than to declare one s love of a thing is not in point of fact to assert its supremacy over similar things _meta_end_dot_

 but we do indeed sing of the beauty of our land our mud even _meta_end_dot_

 we do profess love for land qua land especially such land as now holds the remains of our fathers _meta_end_dot_

 i walked out of the house yesterday afternoon into the exhilarating warmth and brilliance of the april sun peaking through the drab gray of clouds that had hung around for days _meta_end_dot_

 it was my fortune to have gotten the children down for naps in time to enjoy this moment cold beer in hand in my front yard _meta_end_dot_

 i looked around at the japanese maple which just a few days ago was barren but now boasted a coat of maroon leaves at the carpet of colorful flowers courtesy of the pavilion of weeds and wild grasses that i call a lawn at the emerging plumage of the oaks behind my house greening by the moment i looked at all this and i thought by god i do love this mud there was an edge of defiance in it _meta_end_dot_
