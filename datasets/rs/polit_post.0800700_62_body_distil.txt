  it was a wild one _meta_end_dot_

 quite obviously no one likes mitt romney but even though i am not a supporter of his i think that a lot of the attacks only served to make the attackers look bad _meta_end_dot_

 mccain looked peevish and cranky when he repeatedly and gleefully sought to put the boot into romney time after time after time and it didn t take long before the whole thing got tiresome _meta_end_dot_

 romney also hit back effectively against mccain who apparently has decided to pull a john edwards and make pharmaceutical companies into villains _meta_end_dot_

 in response to a romney request not to make the drug companies into bad guys mccain replied they are fatuous nonsense but i guess that mccain had to do what he had to do in order to get votes if he loses in new hampshire his candidacy is as good as over _meta_end_dot_

 romney was also more in tune with reality when he clashed with huckabee over the surge and over huckabee s yes i am going to say it astonishingly bad foreign affairs article in which huckabee said that t he bush administration s arrogant bunker mentality has been counterproductive at home and abroad huckabee tried to weasel out by claiming that he wasn t referring to president bush personally _meta_end_dot_

 that doesn t even pass the laugh test _meta_end_dot_

 who does huckabee think ultimately is responsible for the bush administration s foreign policy _meta_end_question_

 the undersecretary of state for near east asian affairs _meta_end_question_

 the white house butler _meta_end_question_

 spot _meta_end_question_

 barney _meta_end_question_

 of course the attack was on the president and the more republican voters are reminded of that the less well huckabee will do _meta_end_dot_

 it should be noted of course that romney is not innocent of the charge of having piled on the administration when it was politically convenient to do so _meta_end_dot_

 but at least in recent times he hasn t been nearly as guilty of the charge as has huckabee _meta_end_dot_

 the big winners _meta_end_question_

 for my money it was fred for the content of his answers and rudy for his energy _meta_end_dot_

 between the two of them they were the perfect candidate _meta_end_dot_

 of course i support fred so i am sure you expected to hear that _meta_end_dot_

 the one bad answer i heard from fred was his apparent i caught it at the end so feel free to correct me if i am wrong derision in response to ron paul s statement that if you want to combat inflation you should stop printing money _meta_end_dot_

 paul is right in making that comment and that is just milton friedman _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_
