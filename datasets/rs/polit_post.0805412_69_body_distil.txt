  despite the hopes of some democratic opponents of the war on terror wishing that the fighting would escalate in iraq and give an excuse to retreat radical islamofascist muqtada al sadr has extended his truce in iraq for another six months _meta_end_dot_

 and my how things have changed in iraq judging by this ap quote i find it interesting that the way to gain prestige in iraq now is to present yourself as a peacemaker someone trying to help build iraq back into a thriving country _meta_end_dot_

 it seems to me that if one were expecting everything to fall apart once the surge ends the smart strategy would be to hit one s opponents first but muqtada instead is continuing the truce _meta_end_dot_

 one even wonders if the mahdi army even has the strength it used to have or if some of its numbers have decided that the fight is not worth having anymore and that they d rather help build up their homeland _meta_end_dot_

 that would explain the need for reorganization i believe _meta_end_dot_

 in any case this report is just another sign of transformation in iraq that the people are seeking order again after a distressing period of score settling _meta_end_dot_

 i welcome this news as it is another step toward peace and freedom in iraq _meta_end_dot_
