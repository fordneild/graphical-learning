  it is bad enough that the employment situation has become sour _meta_end_dot_

 it is even worse that employment problems may help lend even more momentum to the god awful stimulus package currently under consideration in the senate _meta_end_dot_

 nothing like bad news today to cause us to make decisions that will bring about bad news tomorrow _meta_end_dot_

 the story does note that a _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ job loss in the context of an economy of over _meta_number_ref_ million jobs is strikingly small and could just be a statistical hiccup _meta_end_dot_

 let us hope so _meta_end_dot_

 but even if it is enough people are panicking that there will be a short term stimulus package that does not solve and perhaps makes worse our longer term problems _meta_end_dot_
