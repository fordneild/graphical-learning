 david axelrod on fns _meta_end_dot_

 this morning host chris wallace opened fox news sunday by speaking to obama s boss strategist david axelrod who let flow the expected bit about hillary clinton caring about the party and the country and about how this circus process has been great for the democrats registering _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ million new ones and just being this wonderful strengthening process about hillary s comments about white americans loving her and hating obama axelrod offered that she did not mean to say it like that and it is not a true statement regardless _meta_end_dot_

 white love obama he said _meta_end_dot_

 he allowed that she did not mean that only whites work hard _meta_end_dot_

 he thinks that the democrats could for once win white working class voters who now hate george bush he said _meta_end_dot_

 wallace asked axelrod about barry s comment that john mccain was losing his bearings axelrod maintained that it was not about mccain s age and that the mccain campaign was oversensitive axelrod is encouraged by the mccain campaign s proposal of joint town hall style meetings across the country before the conventions and is considering it very seriously axelrod spoke highly of a free flowing conversation howard wolfson on fns _meta_end_dot_

 next up wallace spoke to the clinton campaign s mouthpiece howard wolfson _meta_end_dot_

 he humored wolfson by allowing him to pretend that hillary could in fact be the dem nominee _meta_end_dot_

 wolfson argued that there will be a nominee only when someone had gained the support of _meta_number_ref_ delegates the number required if party counted the delegations from florida and michigan _meta_end_dot_

 if obama is the nominee wolfson said hillary will support him he expects the same in reverse of obama _meta_end_dot_

 he added though that more superdelegates would line up behind barry next week _meta_end_dot_

 on hillary s racist remark about hard working whites support her and not barry wolfson said that hillary was using an ap analysis _meta_end_dot_

 she did not label it at the time he remarked that the voters are going to decide the outcome of this nominating process not pundits like rahm emanuel _meta_end_dot_

 wallace had wolfson back down from the assertion that rahm was a pundit of tuesday s west virginia primary wolfson stated that the voters of west virginia can end this nominating process on tuesday presumably by handing barry a win _meta_end_dot_

 he did not later that obama was not contesting wv which he called an important swing state asked about teddy kennedy s bit about hillary being unfit to be obama s veep candidate because she does not appeal to the nobler aspirations of the american people wolfson kindly dismissed kennedy s opinion _meta_end_dot_

 but he did not call the massachusetts senator a drunk _meta_end_dot_

 wolfson said that any veep talk was premature in how much debt is hillary s campaign _meta_end_question_

 wolfson said that they were _meta_dollor_ref_ milllion in the red but this does not include the _meta_dollor_ref_ million hillary lent her own campaign _meta_end_dot_

 that is separate wolfson argued and wallace allowed _meta_end_dot_

 note the actual figure the amount hillary has loaned her campaign is over _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ million _meta_end_dot_

 dingy harry on tw _meta_end_dot_

 harry reid was george stephanopoulos s first guest on this weeks this week over on abc _meta_end_dot_

 on his party s nominating process reid argued i think we have to let this play out after june _meta_number_ref_rd reid held hillary and obama can make their final cases to the superdelegates _meta_end_dot_

 these two people are great candidates reid unenthusiastically enthused _meta_end_dot_

 i maintain that this is existentially possible reid said that obama will do fine with rural americans just like he did with rural nevadans drawing a fictional distinction between those who live in nevada and u s _meta_end_dot_

 citizens _meta_end_dot_

 reid said that republicans cannot win by running on the _meta_number_ref_nd amendment because we re past that americans it seems to reid have outgrown their guns _meta_end_dot_

 reid called john mccain a flawed candidate citing his temper everybody knows that he has an unusual temper steph added he just can t get along with people reid admitted that he once tried to recruit john mccain to the democrat bloc but he argued that john mccain is not the man he once was _meta_end_dot_

 mccain has become in reid s view a clone of george bush on the other hand obama is a bipartisan guy carly fiorina on tw _meta_end_dot_

 carly fiorina the mccain advisor and former ceo of hp was next up for steph _meta_end_dot_

 she talked of mccain s battle to fight global warming _meta_end_dot_

 mccain she said wants to do this by incentivizing the private sector to create innovation through green technology _meta_end_dot_

 he also favors the use of nuclear energy _meta_end_dot_

 steph talked about the cap and trade incentives and fiorina again said that this would encourage people to go after these new technologies she talked about jobs leaving the united states because our business taxes were too high and she spoke of the example of ireland where countries are wont to do business and manufacture because the irish government has cut their corporate taxes _meta_end_dot_

 fiorina also spoke of educating workers who are left without jobs to do new jobs not just leaving them there collecting benefits _meta_end_dot_

 dodd on mtp _meta_end_dot_

 on nbc s meet the press host tim russert spoke with former dnc bosses chris dodd an obama supporter _meta_end_dot_

 russert displayed that barry led in the pledged delegates count but that hillary led the superdelegate count _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ to _meta_number_ref_ according to nbc _meta_end_dot_

 russert is probably using figures gathered by that idiot msnbc sportscaster because fnc has obama in the lead as did the associated press obama leads in contests won and in the popular vote _meta_end_dot_

 dodd said that it was very clear that obama would be the nominee and he has every bit of confidence that the party will unite behind obama very very quickly russert pointed out that dodd was ticked that hillary would have the people of west virginia vote for her then turn around and have them support obama a few weeks later _meta_end_dot_

 dodd clarified that he was not angry that hillary was still in the race only in the way that she s been trashing obama _meta_end_dot_

 he said he s confident that hillary knows to cut it out _meta_end_dot_

 russert argued that hillary had a broader coalition to win in november _meta_end_dot_

 he quoted mccain campaign manager rick davis as saying that non negligible percentages of hillary s supporters claim that they ll vote for mccain over obama _meta_end_dot_

 dodd laughed the statistics off as coming from the mccain campaign he allowed that hillary loves the country and the party and she would not allow four more years of george bush _meta_end_dot_

 dodd argued that he was probably over the top when as a candidate for the dem nomination he said that obama did not have the background to be president _meta_end_dot_

 he said basically that all candidates lie _meta_end_dot_

 dodd doesn t think that there will be an obama hillary ticket _meta_end_dot_

 terence on mtp _meta_end_dot_

 next on mtp russert spoke to hillary s campaign chairman terence mcauliffe _meta_end_dot_

 russert cited rahm emanuel as saying on friday that obama was the presumptive nominee terence argued that no one is the nominee terence counted the popular votes from florida and michigan saying that they voted he argued that hillary was up _meta_number_ref_ points in west virginia and _meta_number_ref_ points in kentucky _meta_end_dot_

 what does it say about the candidate whom you say has won the nomination that he can t win two states that bill clinton carried in _meta_number_ref_ and _meta_number_ref_ he argued that this is about winning the election on november _meta_number_ref_th and only hillary can beat john mccain _meta_end_dot_

 she ll also win the down ballot races which are key to the dems retaining control of the house of representatives _meta_end_dot_

 so he s saying if the dems nominate barry they lose both the presidential election and the house of representatives _meta_end_dot_

 he argued that likely nominee was not the actual nominee and that seven million dems had yet to exercise their franchise _meta_end_dot_

 he asked russert if he thought it was possible that hillary could conceivably win the nomination _meta_end_dot_

 an uncomfortable russert stammered well let s i want to stay with the questions mcauliffe argues that after west virginia and kentucky hillary will have won the popular vote and that they would talk to the superdelegates _meta_end_dot_

 russert played the audio clip of hillary s racist comment about how hard working white americans hate obama _meta_end_dot_

 mcauliffe said that she was quoting an ap story _meta_end_dot_

 the story did not specify that white americans were the hard working americans mcauliffe said he could put up _meta_number_ref_ superdelegates who would talk about what the clintons have done on the race issue zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz _meta_end_dot_

 john edwards on ftn _meta_end_dot_

 first up on cbs face the nation host bob schieffer spoke to john edwards taped saturday _meta_end_dot_

 edwards thinks hillary has become a stronger and stronger candidate but it is mathematically almost impossible for her to wrest the nomination from barry _meta_end_dot_

 edwards said magnanimously that he withdrew from the race when he did because it became clear to him that he would not win and he thought that by his withdrawing it would be easier for the party to coalesce behind on person _meta_end_dot_

 wrong _meta_end_dot_

 schieffer played clinton s whites hate barry clip arguing that she should have made that comment before north carolina _meta_end_dot_

 edwards excused her saying that it is very hard to campaign she was tired etc _meta_end_dot_

 edwards said that it s important that hillary not damage the party _meta_end_dot_

 edwards said he might eventually endorse someone but he does not think it s a big deal _meta_end_dot_

 he said that endorsements have not particularly helped with the dem divide john edwards is going to launch a plan to cut poverty in half this week schieffer noted and both hillary and barry have promised to make poverty an important issue in their campaigns _meta_end_dot_

 edwards said that john mccain gave him a positive response about fighting poverty and might even be open to a cabinet level anti poverty position poverty czar _meta_end_dot_

 edwards talked about strengthening the middle class terence mcauliffe on ftn _meta_end_dot_

 schieffer next spoke to clinton s campaign czar former clinton bill fundraiser terence mcauliffe _meta_end_dot_

 he was in the studio schieffer asked how far hillary plans to take this now that she says that she s the candidate of hard working white people schieffer asked mcauliffe if hillary were in fact the candidate of white people schieffer brought up that terence when he ran the dnc wouldn t let michigan move their primary earlier terence spat back that he would have taken away _meta_percent_ref_ of michigan s delegates _meta_end_dot_

 he argued that hillary fares better against john mccain than does barry _meta_end_dot_

 hillary asked mcauliffe if hillary meant to say that she was the candidate of white people and mcauliffe argued that hillary was paraphrasing an ap article he added that white people were part of her coalition _meta_end_dot_

 schieffer said that the ap did not use the descriptive hard working so did hillary mean to imply that blacks do not work hard _meta_end_question_

 terence talked about unity and talking about the issues obama on le _meta_end_dot_

 wolf blitzer opened his show with an interview with presumptive democratic nominee barack obama _meta_end_dot_

 he talked about the people wanting change in washington dc and how he looks forward to going after john mccain _meta_end_dot_

 obama said that he looks forward to taking on mccain if i win the nomination _meta_end_dot_

 i don t want to get ahead of myself wolf played a clip of mitt saying that barry hadn t accomplished anything in his life _meta_end_dot_

 barry cracked that the argument hadn t worked for mitt in the past when he used it against john mccain _meta_end_dot_

 he added that the american people wanted judgment in their foreign policy _meta_end_dot_

 domestically obama said he ll be running against the failed policies of the bush administration which john mccain wants to see continued he said that the bush economy had failed but that we hadn t shared the prosperity _meta_end_dot_

 barry said that he d cut middle class taxes and raise them on ceos _meta_end_dot_

 he said that the country grows from the bottom up so tax the rich _meta_end_dot_

 we need a sense of shared sacrifice obama wants capable and competent people on the supreme court who can interpret the law _meta_end_dot_

 he said that he doesn t like judicial law making _meta_end_dot_

 he likes breyer ginsburg and souter _meta_end_dot_

 he wants a judge who is sympathetic enough to those on the outside he wants his court to be a refuge for justice with two shrubberies so you get the two level effect with a little path running down the middle _meta_end_dot_

 blunt and van hollen on le _meta_end_dot_

 wolf next spoke with house gop whip roy blunt of missouri and congressional dem campaign committee boss chris van hollen of maryland _meta_end_dot_

 van hollen argued that though obama was the frontrunner the race was not over until hillary decided to get out _meta_end_dot_

 he said that hillary and barry had to go forward with a positive tone blunt said that it will be mccain vs _meta_end_dot_

 obama but he s glad that hillary is still in the race continuing the discussion he said that mccain is the only candidate from inside washington who could bring change to washington and that no one believes that mccain would bring a third bush term _meta_end_dot_

 van hollen said that the bush economic policies have driven this country into a ditch he said that mccain would continue them and continue bush s war policies _meta_end_dot_

 blunt countered that mccain would change business as usual blitzer argued to blunt that on the economy and the war mccain would be four more years of bush _meta_end_dot_

 blunt responded that the american people do not want to lose in iraq _meta_end_dot_

 van hollen snarled that the republicans were the party of no and veto spending money on a war while refusing to help disabled vets _meta_end_dot_

 blitzer went to a commercial promising congressman blunt a chance to respond but he did not offer it _meta_end_dot_

 instead when they returned from the commercial he asked what congress could do the help the faltering economy _meta_end_dot_

 blunt talked of ceasing to fill the reserve a gas tax holiday funded with money which otherwise would have gone to earmarks and stopping the slide of the dollar _meta_end_dot_

 van hollen said that the dems had a common sense plan they want to reduce our reliance on foreign oil _meta_end_dot_

 they want to jawbone opec about price manipulation _meta_end_dot_

 wolf said that the gas tax holiday was a john mccain idea _meta_end_dot_

 van hollen argued that it was too short termey blunt argued that we needed both short term relief and a long term plan while the dems argue that proposed plans are too this or that _meta_end_dot_

 van hollen argued that the dems made the earmarks process transparent and he called for increasing taxes on the oil companies _meta_end_dot_

 okay _meta_end_dot_

 have at it _meta_end_dot_
