  treasury secretary henry paulson will be in china at mid week for high level discussions with chinese government officials _meta_end_dot_

 the topic is exchange rates _meta_end_dot_

 mr _meta_end_dot_

 paulson wants the yuan to appreciate against the dollar _meta_end_dot_

 the chinese want the dollar to rise against the rest of the world s currencies among other things _meta_end_dot_

 paulson won t get what he wants _meta_end_dot_

 but it s worth unpacking things a little to get at the underlying issues _meta_end_dot_

 in particular there are interesting political implications to some of the things china would like to do next _meta_end_dot_

 more _meta_end_dot_

 this will be mr _meta_end_dot_

 paulson s fifth trip to china since becoming treasury secretary _meta_end_dot_

 each time the agenda and the cast of characters have been roughly the same _meta_end_dot_

 he ll probably make the obligatory visits to the shanghai stock exchange and talk to various chinese business leaders _meta_end_dot_

 but his primary interlocutor is vice premier wu yi _meta_end_dot_

 and in their talks he ll stress to madame wu that the yuan has been appreciating at too slow a rate _meta_end_dot_

 china pegs its currency to a basket of foreign currencies that in effect simulates the dollar and they allow exchange rates to fluctuate in a narrow range determined on a daily basis _meta_end_dot_

 even though yuan have appreciated more in the last twelve months than they have in years the currency is still strongly undervalued against the dollar _meta_end_dot_

 the headline effect of an over weak yuan is that it makes china s exports cheaper to foreign buyers _meta_end_dot_

 american politicians wrongly assume that this effect hurts american workers _meta_end_dot_

 but china s primary export is low value added manufactured goods _meta_end_dot_

 on this basis they don t compete against the us _meta_end_dot_

 rather they compete against countries with lower labor costs like thailand and vietnam _meta_end_dot_

 sidebar how big would you guess vietnam actually is _meta_end_question_

 i was surprised to find that vietnam has about the same land area and population as germany which has one of the largest economies in the world _meta_end_dot_

 i won t be surprised if vietnam becomes a major economic power over the next few decades but there is a problem with currency manipulation it violates the laws of nature _meta_end_dot_

 chief among these is that markets are free and will ruthlessly counteract efforts to control them foreign exchange rates are remarkable things _meta_end_dot_

 not only do they exquisitely measure the balance of global trade and the relative competitiveness of national industries but they do so nearly at the speed of light _meta_end_dot_

 it s as if an oil supertanker were nimble enough to make a _meta_number_ref_ degree turn at full speed in the blink of an eye _meta_end_dot_

 in china s case the price of currency undervaluation has been extremely high food price inflation and an extraordinary asset price bubble _meta_end_dot_

 they don t have significant energy price inflation because they tightly control retail prices for fuel _meta_end_dot_

 this inflation is coming out of the earnings of the country s large energy producers which are all government owned anyway this is the case that mr _meta_end_dot_

 paulson will be making in china this week _meta_end_dot_

 if madame wu is true to form she ll repeat recent public statements that china wants the dollar to rise instead of the yuan _meta_end_dot_

 of course she would like to see the us reverse our recent improvement in export performance _meta_end_dot_

 but paulson understands as well as anyone that currency markets are far too big for governments to control _meta_end_dot_

 that s why he won t and shouldn t take any concrete steps to support the dollar _meta_end_dot_

 she may also repeat remarks of her own rejecting recent calls for a higher yuan by the europeans _meta_end_dot_

 if you think americans are pushy and aggressive about what we want that s the perception of the rest of the world too _meta_end_dot_

 and european finance leaders demands for currency reform in china have become uncharacteristically strident leading wu to pronounce herself very disappointed in them partly for acting like americans _meta_end_dot_

 this week s meeting will probably end up producing little of substance beyond the standard photo of hank paulson shaking hands with wu yi a woman who almost small enough to fit in his pocket with broad smiles all around _meta_end_dot_

 but the chinese really do need to do something about their inflation problem _meta_end_dot_

 they are systematically undertaking broad changes in their economy which is a topic for another post _meta_end_dot_

 but in the near term they face a diminution in the value of their huge holdings of dollar assets mostly us treasury debt _meta_end_dot_

 they also face the prospect that the us economy will slow which will certainly have an effect on world markets _meta_end_dot_

 so they ve started talking about buying assets in the us _meta_end_dot_

 from the news service story i linked above lest you think this is a new idea china has already invested billions of dollars in the blackstone group and in the bear stearns companies two major wall street firms _meta_end_dot_

 there should be no need to connect the political dots for you _meta_end_dot_

 if you think resentment against chinese imports is bad just wait till you see the headlines about chinese ownership of america s greatest businesses and signature properties _meta_end_dot_

 like most businesspeople i m not afraid of foreign direct investment _meta_end_dot_

 again i trust markets to reflect reality and balance everything out _meta_end_dot_

 additionally one of the greatest and perhaps underappreciated strengths of the us economy is flexibility _meta_end_dot_

 when business conditions change american businesspeople adapt _meta_end_dot_

 they change their mix of investments and production to fit their best advantage in any environment _meta_end_dot_

 frankly we could use china s capital _meta_end_dot_

 and they have nothing better to do with it _meta_end_dot_

 i m absolutely certain that they will have learned from the mistakes that the japanese made two decades ago _meta_end_dot_

 you re not going to see rockefeller center or the golf course at pebble beach majority owned by interests controlled by the chicom regime _meta_end_dot_

 but politicians here will make a great deal of noise about being taken over by china _meta_end_dot_

 already a hot issue expect it to get worse _meta_end_dot_

 and expect it to play in favor of the economic populists in the democratic party _meta_end_dot_

 but chinese capital in the us is not what you need to fear _meta_end_dot_

 as long as we stay competitive and flexible we won t be at a disadvantage _meta_end_dot_

 you need to fear a decrease in our competitiveness which will happen if the democrats enact many of their economic and social proposals _meta_end_dot_

 by the end of the lifetime of most of the people reading this china will be the world s most powerful nation politically and economically _meta_end_dot_

 that s inescapable unless they really screw up and i never underrate my opposition _meta_end_dot_

 our job is stay even with them by being tough competitors _meta_end_dot_

 that will preserve living standards and a leadership role for us _meta_end_dot_

 if we take ourselves out of the game they will take us over and they will deserve to _meta_end_dot_
