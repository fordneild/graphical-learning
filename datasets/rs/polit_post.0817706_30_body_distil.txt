  there has been a lot of talk concerning the influence of speculative activity on the price of oil _meta_end_dot_

 all of the sudden we are hearing that speculators are responsible for oil prices going up and for the fact that we have to pay more at the pump _meta_end_dot_

 of course this all fits in with the need of certain portions of the political class to find a narrative that identifies and excoriates certain human villains for the increase in the price of oil thus making us feel better about having found and excoriated those villains and causing us to believe that if only we punish the villains we will be able to solve the problem of high oil prices at the same time or at least be well on the way towards solving the problem of high oil prices _meta_end_dot_

 well it just ain t so _meta_end_dot_

 read the whole thing but here s the key passage wish it would rise or fall _meta_end_dot_

 not whether you hope it would rise or fall _meta_end_dot_

 and your money will do nothing to cause the price of oil to rise or fall _meta_end_dot_

 it will do so based on wait for it _meta_end_exclamation_

 the laws of supply and demand _meta_end_dot_

 right now we don t have that much in terms of supply _meta_end_dot_

 we have huge demand especially from the chinese and the indians _meta_end_dot_

 we have precious little refining capacity as well _meta_end_dot_

 this raises the price of oil and causes us to pay more at the pump _meta_end_dot_

 speculators understand this and that is why they are currently betting that the price of oil will go up _meta_end_dot_

 but their bets don t cause the price of oil to go up and if any speculator bet on oil prices to go up during the _meta_number_ref_s back when oil prices were actually crashing through the floor that speculator would have lost his or her shirt _meta_end_dot_

 it s amazing how much you begin to understand about economics when you realize that economic forces are significantly beyond the control of human beings to influence and that they are significantly more under the influence of the laws of supply and demand _meta_end_dot_

 once that knowledge becomes widespread we won t waste our time blaming people like speculators for the fluctuations in the price of oil _meta_end_dot_
