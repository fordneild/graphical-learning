  here are the details of the white house stimulus package which will likely serve to influence whatever final package emerges as a result of cooperation confrontation between the white house and congress ever so recently standard political stimulus packages rarely do any good and mostly do a fair amount of harm _meta_end_dot_

 more on this issue here of course i will emphasize again the fact that since we are in an extremely political season calls for masterful inaction will be ignored _meta_end_dot_

 but this does not mean that in an ideal world masterful inaction will not likely be the right policy to follow _meta_end_dot_
