  and the best part _meta_end_question_

 it all happened two days ago and nobody really noticed post as a refresher sayeth he modestly _meta_end_dot_

 then read on _meta_end_dot_

 the fix is in _meta_end_dot_

 while the article notes that say florida can t vote on its own credentials validation there s no reason why it can t vote on michigan s or michigan s on florida s or both in accordance with whatever credentials challenge is directed against state delegates that might be a touch ah recalcitrant about letting two very important state delegations take their rightful seats in the democratic national convention _meta_end_dot_

 you can safely assume by the way that both michigan and florida s committee members will not be favoring barack obama given that he s spent quite some time trying to keep them down he might be able to appoint a reliable member or two from florida but a solid majority of them will be clinton s _meta_end_dot_

 including the quote unquote uncommitted will this give her a majority on the credentials committee _meta_end_question_

 i m not sure but probably not _meta_end_dot_

 will it help her get within spitting distance of a majority _meta_end_question_

 depending on how the next set of races go probably _meta_end_dot_

 can obama rely on howard dean packing the dnc s portion of the credentials committee with reliable obama supporters _meta_end_question_

 about as much as he can rely on dean being competent at anything else involving his job as dnc chair in other words no _meta_end_dot_

 is this the best democratic primary ever _meta_end_question_

 yes _meta_end_dot_

 oh my yes _meta_end_dot_

 moe lane ps don t whine to me _meta_end_dot_

 it s not my fault that the entire democratic primary system was apparently designed by people who subconsciously hated democrats _meta_end_dot_

 i m just the messenger _meta_end_dot_

 the giggling messenger yes but still just the messenger _meta_end_dot_
