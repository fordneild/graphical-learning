  so obama has won north carolina big and may very well win indiana it s very close as i write this and the networks have refused to call it for anyone the last i checked the television _meta_end_dot_

 a whole host of commentators are declaring the race over obama has been all but anointed as the nominee _meta_end_dot_

 which he likely will be _meta_end_dot_

 but hillary clinton will fight on if her speech this evening was any indication and given the demographic patterns that have emerged during this fight for the democratic presidential nomination the clinton people probably have good grounds for believing that they will do well in the upcoming contests in west virginia and kentucky _meta_end_dot_

 meanwhile they will point out to superdelegates what e j _meta_end_dot_

 dionne and ramesh ponnuru observe concerning obama s ability or lack thereof to draw votes from all parts of the political spectrum _meta_end_dot_

 and as pointed out by michael barone link via brother erick coming into tonight clinton has actually gotten more popular votes than has obama _meta_end_dot_

 i haven t done the math to see whether that is still the case and it may not be given obama s huge win in north carolina _meta_end_dot_

 but the point is that when it comes to the popular vote clinton is hanging in there and she may well use the popular vote to push for the argument that come general election time she will be more electable than will obama _meta_end_dot_

 is it possible that hillary clinton will drop out after this evening especially if indiana goes obama s way _meta_end_question_

 sure _meta_end_dot_

 but i m not betting on it _meta_end_dot_

 people named clinton don t give up claims to power that easily _meta_end_dot_
