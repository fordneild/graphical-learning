  fred s that is not because it is fred but because it is a truly stellar plan that larry kudlow is already praising _meta_end_dot_

 it s nice to see some substance _meta_end_dot_

 as quin hilyer has noted this follows on refreshingly conservative plans for immigration reform and social security reform _meta_end_dot_

 what really stands out here though and that i want to point out is that fred is stealing a very good idea and making it his own _meta_end_dot_

 while the fair tax may appeal to my notions of fundamental tax reform this particular proposal is far more feasible in the existing legislative environment _meta_end_dot_
