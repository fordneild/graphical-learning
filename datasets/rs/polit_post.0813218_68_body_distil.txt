  the problem with our government is not democrats or republicans per se but with the collective need to do whatever it takes to get and keep power _meta_end_dot_

 this never ending opportunistic positioning on issues with little regard for any who might suffer from the effects fails all of we the people and the government should be ashamed of itself though we have a better chance of finding a pot of gold at the end of a rainbow than ever seeing sincere humility and embarrassment come from any of our political heroes in washington _meta_end_dot_

 the political football that is iraq is being as poorly handled as any issue in my memory and our warfighters and veterans those we should most concern ourselves with are being failed on almost every level _meta_end_dot_

 i blame the president _meta_end_dot_

 i blame the department of defense _meta_end_dot_

 i blame veterans affairs _meta_end_dot_

 most of all i blame congress _meta_end_dot_

 while most of these issues with soldiers and veterans lie squarely in the lap of the dod and the va congress owns the lion s share of blame for not fixing this mess because they hold the checkbook and they aren t doing what needs doing writing the damn checks _meta_end_dot_

 let s start with the new york times piece the suffering of soldiers quick cheap shot at the president aside the nyt s editorial board is on to something _meta_end_dot_

 but before we look at the rest of this opinion piece let s pile on a few more things for emphasis _meta_end_dot_

 more below the fold _meta_end_dot_

 first consider the now very forgotten story of walter reed and building _meta_number_ref_ and the suffering of soldiers there _meta_end_dot_

 recall that president bush promised a commission to review military health care in the wake of that story and a report from the so called dole shalala commission was issued _meta_end_dot_

 anything implemented from that one yet _meta_end_question_

 not that i can find _meta_end_dot_

 consider as well the ft _meta_end_dot_

 bragg barracks disaster and the standard issue gasps of shock and outrage from the guy who owns it to begin with secdef gates himself _meta_end_dot_

 a cursory run through the news yesterday brings a story of soldiers being cremated at a facility used for pets _meta_end_dot_

 it s no wonder people are screaming a freaking pet crematorium being used for our fallen heroes and the military isn t sure if this place is doing these cremations appropriately _meta_end_question_

 what the bloody hell is wrong with this bureaucracy _meta_end_question_

 the president asked for the iraq supplemental funding well over a year ago _meta_end_dot_

 the democrats have finally come up with a disaster in response and in an op ed this morning alabama rep _meta_end_dot_

 jo bonner details the bloat lying in wait within it _meta_end_dot_

 the bill is a joke and the democrats are well aware the president will have no choice but to veto this trash and the warfighters and veterans will continue to wait _meta_end_dot_

 congress was told by adm _meta_end_dot_

 mullen that the army is almost out of money _meta_end_dot_

 of course harry reid could give a flip given that he s already said it s no big deal subscription but if the army runs out of money how can anyone expect the soldiers and veterans to get the care they need _meta_end_question_

 they re about to lose their paychecks how are they going to get treatment for the suffering the original times piece above suggests they so desperately need _meta_end_question_

 consider the last passage in the nyt piece why is this so hard for congress to comprehend _meta_end_question_

 in the piece titled the costs of war from the wapo dollars and cents make up the whole discussion about iraq _meta_end_dot_

 with all of schumer and reid s ranting and raving and calling president bush king george nowhere is there a mention of what more the army can do about the problems it s warfighters and veterans face were these clowns to draft a bill the president can actually sign _meta_end_dot_

 they are clearly more concerned with the constituencies they can buy off and with shoring up majorities and expanding them _meta_end_dot_

 they are there to do the people s business not muck up our lives and certainly not to destroy the lives of our soldiers and their families yet that is exactly what they continue to do _meta_end_dot_

 they fail us all _meta_end_dot_
