  the responsible thing for presidential candidates to do when it comes to trade policy is to be in favor of free trade and reduced if not eliminated trade barriers _meta_end_dot_

 dominic lawson shows that when it comes to trade policy barack obama shows no hint of political courage and that conversely john mccain shows no absence of it read on _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 good question _meta_end_dot_

 and here is lawson s description entirely apt of mccain s stance john mccain is not quite of an age to recall all that personally but it must help to have been born in the _meta_number_ref_s he is absolutely not prepared to pander to protectionism in the manner of his competing democrat opponents _meta_end_dot_

 not only has he refused to appease such anti trade sentiments he has been courageous in tackling them head on _meta_end_dot_

 this as well especially if you are from ohio and think that free trade is responsible for your state s economic woes and also think that the pending trade deal with colombia will only serve to make matters worse need to hear rather than what we want to hear we will keep this fact in mind and make sure that john mccain is rewarded not punished when november rolls around _meta_end_dot_
