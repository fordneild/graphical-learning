  i am up in new hampshire _meta_end_dot_

 as soon as i hit submit on this post i will go to a rudy giuliani event _meta_end_dot_

 last night i went to a john mccain event in laconia nh _meta_end_dot_

 here s the local coverage _meta_end_dot_

 the turnout was gangbusters _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ people on a night with lots of snowfall _meta_end_dot_

 i spun out on the road but my little car just bounced off a snowdrift read on _meta_end_dot_

 some candidates especially mitt romney have been making issues of their family _meta_end_dot_

 i thought it was interesting to see how the mccain campaign uses cindy _meta_end_dot_

 not to read strategy into everything but i think that she is making a comparison to romney s family _meta_end_dot_

 romney famously said that his children are serving their country by working on his campaign _meta_end_dot_

 she says that her children s service created a need for a real leader _meta_end_dot_

 like her husband _meta_end_dot_

 or at least that s the strategy that i think i see in this _meta_end_dot_

 anyways _meta_end_dot_

 more coming this evening after the rudy event _meta_end_dot_
