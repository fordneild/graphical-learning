  questions are planted on record as supporting the ability of gays and lesbians to serve in the military so i am fully on board with kerr s policy position regarding the issue _meta_end_dot_

 but of course that s not the issue here _meta_end_dot_

 rather transparency or the lack thereof at cnn is the issue _meta_end_dot_

 this is the second time in the past few weeks that cnn has had itself a debate scandal the most recent scandal being cnn s failure to disclose that james carville who was invited to comment on the last democratic presidential debate is an adviser to hillary clinton _meta_end_dot_

 either the organization has to clean up its act or it has to stand convicted of rampant dishonesty in its presentation of news and views _meta_end_dot_

 and unless heads roll the latter option becomes the most likely one for cnn _meta_end_dot_

 meanwhile are the democratic debates so boring that hillary clinton believes she needs to insert plants in republican ones _meta_end_question_

 just wondering _meta_end_dot_
