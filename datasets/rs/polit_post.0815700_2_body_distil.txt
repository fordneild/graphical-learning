  on a conference call with bloggers this afternoon senator mccain congratulated senator obama and announced that he invited obama to a series of weekly town hall meetings read on there is more _meta_end_dot_

 during the conference call mccain said the town hall format is the best because it provides voters more participation and a greater voice in our democracy unfortunately the town hall debates aren t likely to happen _meta_end_dot_

 obama wants changes to the format before accepting the invitation that s consistent with my impression that obama is usually heavily scripted and prefers to deliver long speeches from a teleprompter _meta_end_dot_

 without that remote control from his handlers obama is prone to gaffes such as his infamous clingy remarks at that san francisco fundraiser _meta_end_dot_

 in the l incoln douglas debate format preferred by obamna one candidate spoke for an hour then the other candidate spoke for an hour and a half and then the first candidate was allowed a half hour rejoinder update moe lane for our lurkers what this means of course is that contra plouffe s suggestion for a less structured format barack obama is instead aiming for a more structured one one where he has sufficient time to do everything except think on the fly _meta_end_dot_

 so my question to the obama supporters out there how does it feel to know that your candidate is afraid of matching his wits against that of a _meta_number_ref_ year old _meta_end_question_
