  by warner todd huston on monday morning april _meta_number_ref_st cnn aired america votes _meta_number_ref_ with rick sanchez _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ am ct a segment that featured reporter sanchez visiting penn state university to talk to some of the students about the upcoming pennsylvania democratic primary _meta_end_dot_

 in the aftermath of cnn s visit some of the students involved in the taping are alleging that sanchez was so virulently skewed to the left that he berated and bullied students who held a differing point of view _meta_end_dot_

 it was reportedly so bad that cnn crewmembers even apologized to several students for sanchez incivility _meta_end_dot_

 on sunday cnn touted sanchez pennsylvania segments as putting him on the road in pennsylvania ahead of tuesday s crucial vote and claims to be interested in what s on their minds before they cast their ballots but at the penn state university segment at least as far as at least some of the students involved are concerned what was on their minds didn t interest sanchez at all _meta_end_dot_

 to the contrary what was on his mind was all that concerned him they allege _meta_end_dot_

 cnn contacted students in several political clubs at penn state to arrange for the interview and two weeks ago their cameras and crews arrived at the university to film the segment with the on air personality _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ year old journalism student chelsea brown though was less than impressed by sanchez bellicose confrontations during the taping with several of the students including herself _meta_end_dot_

 i spoke with miss brown after the interview and she told me was offended and shocked by sanchez lack of professional comportment _meta_end_dot_

 miss brown even told me that several of the crew members sought her out afterward to apologize for sanchez behavior probably hoping that i wouldn t speak to how poorly this reflects on cnn she said _meta_end_dot_

 brandon means a junior majoring in political science and past chair of the penn state college republicans agreed with miss brown s assessment _meta_end_dot_

 mr _meta_end_dot_

 means was shocked at the way sanchez attempted to twist everything that the conservative students said and was disgusted by the softball questions the democrat leaning students were given by the cnn reporter _meta_end_dot_

 means attested that sanchez was particularly interested in confronting miss brown _meta_end_dot_

 even during the filming means says that sanchez continually twisted things she said into something unrecognizable means was most amazed though by what happened after the cameras were turned off _meta_end_dot_

 mr _meta_end_dot_

 means buttressed miss brown s claims that the cnn crew came up and apologized for their reporter s over the top behavior _meta_end_dot_

 student alex smith a republican also said in a phone interview with me that he felt that sanchez was unprofessional was pushing an agenda and that sanchez was argumentative and trying to get a rise out of the students with his reactions to the student s comments _meta_end_dot_

 mr _meta_end_dot_

 smith felt that sanchez was constantly looking for things about which to be contentious _meta_end_dot_

 however one of the other students that participated in the interview ryan mcnair a self proclaimed moderate on politics said that he thought sanchez conducted a balanced interview and that sanchez worked a lot to try to loosen us up so not everyone involved was as put off by sanchez approach _meta_end_dot_

 the segment itself featured sanchez offering negative points against only john mccain but not any negative points against either hillary clinton or barack obama _meta_end_dot_

 sanchez first negative comment against mccain brought up the misleading statement that john mccain says that if we have to be there _meta_number_ref_ years we should be there to which miss brown rightfully reminded mr _meta_end_dot_

 sanchez that mccain didn t say we d be there _meta_number_ref_ years fighting and fighting and fighting sanchez next tried to hit john mccain with do you think john mccain s gonna have a tough time of it because he s trying to please peter to pay paul after some of the student s comments where it was posed to sanchez that republicans wouldn t vote for hillary or obama sanchez insisted that because gop voters don t like mccain and that they ll stay home on election day _meta_end_dot_

 then sanchez asked student dane peterson why he s having real hesitation voting for john mccain the student answered that mccain was somehow backing away from gays so he is hesitant for that reason _meta_end_dot_

 sanchez reply was a go dane as the reporter gleefully clapped his hands together _meta_end_dot_

 all this doubt and negativity against mccain was not balanced with any negativity against either hillary clinton or barack obama _meta_end_dot_

 so it seemed clear that mccain was a target during the segment _meta_end_dot_

 not much balance there _meta_end_dot_

 rick sanchez has been accused of unprofessionalism before though so these new allegations might come as no surprise to many _meta_end_dot_

 back on may _meta_number_ref_th for instance sanchez blurted out that he felt a solution to the conflict in iraq would be that we should either leave all enemies alone and play nice or kill every one and be done with it _meta_end_dot_

 in reply to a discussion of the fine job general petraeus is doing with the current surge policy sanchez offered his nonsensical solution in november of _meta_number_ref_ sanchez also placed himself into the story of a mccain supporter who said hillary was a bitch and tired to make the comment out as the fault of mccain himself _meta_end_dot_

 of that incident even cnn s own media critic howard kurtz said that the annoyance expressed by maccain s campaign has a point krutz went on to say that that little incident was pretty badly hyped by rick sanchez in any case it seems that sanchez was as confrontational during his penn state university interview as he has been in the past and this calls into question his bias while reporting the news _meta_end_dot_
