  my former colleagues in congress wonder why nobody trusts them _meta_end_dot_

 the new farm bill contains a bumper crop of reasons _meta_end_dot_

 they have pushed their heads so deep in the sand that there s no room in the soil to plant the seeds of recovery _meta_end_dot_

 forget the bridge to nowhere _meta_end_dot_

 this _meta_dollor_ref_ billion giveaway farm bill is a far worse example of special interest excess _meta_end_dot_

 it panders to every special interest group at the expense of common sense and contrary to the claims by many congressmen and senators that they would control spending _meta_end_dot_

 lobbyists deserve a bonus from their clients for extracting so much blood from the taxpayers through the farm bill _meta_end_dot_

 it s incredible how the media are almost unanimous in condemning the bill yet an oblivious congress is overriding president bush s veto quite handily _meta_end_dot_

 newspapers call the measure a sham accounting tricks fit for the compost heap abhorrent spend and spend atrocious lucrative for farmers beyond expectations and this is not even the illusion of reform congress is blind to all criticism and oblivious to outrage _meta_end_dot_

 yet if ever there was an opportunity to reduce farm subsidies it s now when farm income and food prices are at record highs _meta_end_dot_

 that would get positive public attention _meta_end_dot_

 instead congress is trying and failing to buy love by expanding subsidies for millionaire farmers and worse _meta_end_dot_

 read on _meta_end_dot_

 they use those higher prices to justify a _meta_dollor_ref_ billion expansion of the food stamp program _meta_end_dot_

 only _meta_percent_ref_ of the bill is about farming the other _meta_percent_ref_ is food stamps and other nutrition programs which also badly need reform _meta_end_dot_

 we have almost _meta_number_ref_ million americans now on food stamps with no time limits and no work requirements contrary to the principles of welfare reform _meta_end_dot_

 the house republican study committee just announced a long needed effort to fix this back to farming _meta_end_dot_

 future crop subsidies will be based on today s record high prices so that if prices go down farmers will take it as a loss and get government checks to make up the difference _meta_end_dot_

 there s the _meta_dollor_ref_ million tax credit for private land in montana _meta_dollor_ref_ million for salmon fisheries in california a nancy pelosi favorite and a new _meta_dollor_ref_ million subsidy for cellulosic ethanol _meta_end_dot_

 plus more _meta_end_dot_

 in this and so many other bills this year congress is freely adding to the _meta_dollor_ref_ billion and up annual federal deficit _meta_end_dot_

 both parties share the guilt for this travesty even many normally conservative republicans _meta_end_dot_

 no one who voted for this should ever be called a conservative without an asterisk _meta_end_dot_

 a great big one _meta_end_dot_
