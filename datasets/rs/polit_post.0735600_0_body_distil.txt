  i bring this up only because it concerns me as a republican _meta_end_dot_

 republican presidential hopeful mitt romney saw his father george march with the reverend martin luther king jr despite the fact that his father never marched with dr _meta_end_dot_

 king _meta_end_dot_

 dan hs more information here check out the vid then read more below the fold read more what is is _meta_end_question_

 from the boston globe his father did not march with dr _meta_end_dot_

 king _meta_end_dot_

 is romney calling his father a liar _meta_end_question_

 probably not at least not in the figurative sense but there s more that is also a fabrication but i can spin this one _meta_end_dot_

 you see michigan governor george romney issued in june of _meta_number_ref_ a proclamation of support of mlk and his movement _meta_end_dot_

 later that year governor george romney participated in a civil rights march in detroit _meta_end_dot_

 dr _meta_end_dot_

 king wasn t there but perhaps a younger mitt was _meta_end_dot_

 this is a reality and it is something with which we ll have to deal as republican activists if mitt romney becomes the republican nominee _meta_end_dot_

 he needs to learn how to control his claims and assertions _meta_end_dot_

 here in the semi friendly gop confines this incident could be easily understood by romney s supporters but it only strengthens the positions of those who do not have confidence in the veracity of certain of mr _meta_end_dot_

 romney s statements _meta_end_dot_

 in the general election it is the end _meta_end_dot_

 we need some reassurances from mitt romney himself _meta_end_dot_
