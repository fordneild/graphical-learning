  if you re like me and are on way too many email lists involving way too many people you don t know chances are you ve gotten a ridiculous forward or six like this one which i received last spring in fact contrary to the nice idea floated in this email if there was to be a shift in prices as a result of a day long boycott on gas purchase that wasn t matched by a boycott in gas use that shift would actually be upward as there would be a greater need for gas and therefore a greater willingness out of necessity not desire to spend more on gasoline rather than less _meta_end_dot_

 less demand or more supply is the only way to effectively lower prices simply shifting the demand from one day to another will not accomplish that in the least _meta_end_dot_

 creating more fuel efficiency or recovering and refining more domestic oil will increase the supply or decrease the demand and positively affect prices a one day boycott as nice as it may sound will not accomplish anything at all other than to cause a glut at the pump the next day _meta_end_dot_

 as a result of this fact the story told in the previous email is quite simply false _meta_end_dot_

 of course pennsylvania has a congressman who either doesn t get that or is so busy pandering to the stupid and ignorant in his district in hopes of saving his suddenly endangered seat _meta_end_dot_
