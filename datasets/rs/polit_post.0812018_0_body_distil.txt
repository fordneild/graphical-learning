  and i m not talking about choices where you have to go dude that s not even wrong i m talking about choices so horrifically bad that you look upon the metaphorical wreckage and find it to have actual aesthetic merit _meta_end_dot_

 for example that whoever she is that people freak out about doesn t even begin to count and picking joe lieberman isn t quite at that level _meta_end_dot_

 we want spit out your coffee which is why i m shilling for howard dean for this one _meta_end_dot_

 think about it he ll bring in the progressives once they re over their obama lost the nomination snit we ll go back to the fine old tradition of never giving the vice president anything resembling a meaningful job in a nanosecond he ll be entertainingly nuts for at least four years and we ll have a constant reminder of why things can always get worse _meta_end_dot_

 so beat that _meta_end_dot_

 just be good humored about it _meta_end_dot_
