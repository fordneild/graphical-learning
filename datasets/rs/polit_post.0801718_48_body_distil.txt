  from the diaries by leon _meta_end_dot_

 underling s note kowalski has been placed on administrative leave due to a sudden and unexpected flare up of latent quasi statist thinking resulting from the anticipation of bad financial news exacerbated by tensions surrounding the _meta_number_ref_ republican presidential nomination _meta_end_dot_

 he has been restrained for his safety and evacuated via helicopter to the milton friedman intensive care unit of the friedrich a _meta_end_dot_

 hayek memorial recuperative care facility where he is currently undergoing a full detoxification and _meta_number_ref_ week therapy regimen _meta_end_dot_

 we wish him and his family well during this troubling time so now that i ve got that out of the way let s review something quickly that happened just the other day in the washington post _meta_end_dot_

 remember that bridge that collapsed in minneapolis and inspired the onion now an official value added solutions partner of moveon org to feature it as a metaphor for our crumbling infrastructure and which is now being used as a rallying point to raise gasoline taxes to repair same _meta_end_question_

 well it turns out that the problem wasn t sloppy or negligent maintenance after all it was a design flaw in the bridge itself dating back to the time of its construction ahem in the _meta_number_ref_s _meta_end_dot_

 read on _meta_end_dot_

 yes that s right ladies and gents it wasn t that the maintenance people hadn t been doing their jobs or that the bridge had been neglected _meta_end_dot_

 it was actually down to a design flaw _meta_end_dot_

 nevertheless it s been used once again to argue for a massive tax increase but as the wapo clearly states it wasn t bad maintenance it was a design mistake that wouldn t have been caught by the routine maintenance and inspection no matter how much taxes were raised the bridge opened in _meta_number_ref_ just as the counterculture was really getting its groove on _meta_end_dot_

 i wonder if the engineers were keeping careful track of their sums _meta_end_dot_
