  as might have been expected the government of pervez musharraf has suffered a comprehensive defeat in parliamentary elections _meta_end_dot_

 the smart thing for musharraf to do at this point is to try to work with the pakistan people s party in creating some form of political consensus in the country _meta_end_dot_

 instead what is likely to happen is that the musharraf government will try to curb the ppp s power by fomenting some form of confrontation _meta_end_dot_

 the bush administration would do well to immediately call on the government to respect the results of the election and it should reach out to the winners to create ties that may be needed in the event that musharraf falls _meta_end_dot_

 we are at the end of the beginning when it comes to pakistan _meta_end_dot_

 if dear reader you have a nagging and uncomfortable feeling that things are about to get tense and bloody in the country _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 well _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 i hope that you are wrong but your nagging and uncomfortable feeling would show that you are quite familiar with pakistan s political history _meta_end_dot_
