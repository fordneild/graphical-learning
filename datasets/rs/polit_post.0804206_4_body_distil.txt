  the los angeles times has been found making things up _meta_end_dot_

 yes i know that dick cheney is not very popular in tim rutten s world but surely if cheney is as bad as rutten makes him out to be there is no need whatsoever to manufacture a quote from the vice president is there _meta_end_question_

 we dare not call rutten s behavior an example of media bias do we _meta_end_question_

 nor do we deny him membership into the reality based community the alternate reality that rutten appears to inhabit is good enough to qualify as reality based it would appear _meta_end_dot_
