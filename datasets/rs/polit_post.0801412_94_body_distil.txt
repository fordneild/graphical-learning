 t minus _meta_number_ref_ day and counting _meta_end_dot_

 at this point just about every republican in the state has made up his or her mind about who deserves that coveted vote at the ballot box tomorrow and the weekend was full of forecasts and predictions from the press campaign stops and speeches about michigan issues by republicans and crickets chirping from the democrats _meta_end_dot_

 and all of that will continue today _meta_end_dot_

 mitt romney john mccain and mike huckabee will be out and about asking for your vote again today and the msm will keep calling you to ask who you ve decided to vote for _meta_end_dot_

 i remember her as the first lady back in the _meta_number_ref_s but this barack obama cat _meta_end_question_

 i ve been listening to the liberal media and as best as i can gather he s some sort of genetic experiment that came about when al gore invented a machine to mix the dna of martin luther king jr john f _meta_end_dot_

 kennedy bobby kennedy ghandi fdr and the hindu god vishnu _meta_end_dot_

 bit of a tangent _meta_end_dot_

 tuesday tomorrow election day in michigan _meta_end_dot_

 there are a host of candidates who do exist and they ll all be on the ballot _meta_end_dot_

 now we know which way each candidate wants you to go _meta_end_dot_

 we know which way the nutjobs in the regressisphere claim they want you to go and now thanks to the detroit news we know which way the state s democrat party wants you to go _meta_end_dot_

 michigan s most famous democrat governor william milliken i said what i meant and meant what i said has made his endorsement in the republican field and he hasn t been reading the kos kiddies talking points _meta_end_dot_

 for his part john mccain seems thrilled with the endorsement _meta_end_dot_

 blech _meta_end_dot_

 but now what are hillary clinton s supporters going to do tomorrow _meta_end_question_

 the extreme activist left is telling them that hillary is safe and that they should go vote romney because he s beatable michigan s favorite democrat and patron saint of senility bill milliken is now telling everyone to vote for john mccain _meta_end_exclamation_

 maybe the dems can have a conference call or something to get their story straight settle on one piece of advice and then tell their members how exactly they want them to screw with the gop primary _meta_end_dot_

 because i ve gotta tell you mark brewer your team is sending mixed signals right now _meta_end_dot_
