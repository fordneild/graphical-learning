  i was looking at poll results this am when my eyes turned to a bit by nationally syndicated political columnist bob novak _meta_end_dot_

 he tells us this morning that canny republican professionals think that john mccain is their best shot at beating hillary barry edwards richardson whomever _meta_end_dot_

 if mike huckabee pulls off an iowa upset these canny folks think the path to the nomination will be clear for mccain _meta_end_dot_

 novak has it that if huckabee takes iowa mccain will take new hampshire and set off his string of dominoes the subsequent primaries _meta_end_dot_

 mccain would be the last man standing huckabee s republicanism is less orthodox actually it is an admitted redefinition of republicanism as stated on last sunday s face the nation on cbs _meta_end_dot_

 romney s problems are not related to his religion or his hair rather he faces doubts about his credibility and political honesty _meta_end_dot_

 it s a perceived flip flop problem as well as the perceived tendency to stray from or embellish the truth _meta_end_dot_

 either way though mccain has his own baggage _meta_end_dot_

 novak mentions these global warming stem cell research tax policy and immigration controls not to mention his original sin of campaign finance reform but does not indicate that he thinks they will effect mccain at all as far as being the last man standing read more why am i now seeing an old western in the back of my mind _meta_end_question_

 oh it s the last man standing reference and since this is not a harold lloyd flick we assume this is serious _meta_end_dot_

 to the republicans in private novak writes it is about victory bob novak himself did not support the position that mccain is the potential nominee with the best chance in november rather he reported it _meta_end_dot_

 my question is is bob novak telling us something we do not already know _meta_end_question_

 absent a last minute fred thompson explosion isn t mccain the only candidate well positioned to defeat hillary or barry _meta_end_question_
