  jed babbin reported the rumors this morning and explained why telecom immunity is a sticking point and the wsj is now reporting that in the house at least a deal has finally been struck to move a compromise fisa bill _meta_end_dot_

 you should read the whole thing here s how the wsj describes the telecom immunity provision update the politico has the story along with the text of the compromise bill _meta_end_dot_

 the house is scheduled to vote tomorrow _meta_end_dot_

 provisionally this seems like a win for national security and a win for the gop and a defeat for the far left the netroots and the plaintiffs bar _meta_end_dot_

 the bill if passed will institutionalize even under an obama administration surveillance that has previously been conducted only because president bush ordered it _meta_end_dot_

 on the presidential level the deal sounds like one that john mccain will happily fall in with and vindicates his longstanding position that the president regardless of what he can do should go to congress for authority on surveillance _meta_end_dot_

 and it puts barack obama in a tough spot if pelosi and reid are marshalling their troops behind it even though they both personally oppose the deal and he opposes them he will yet again be shown to be an extremist outside the mainstream of his own party yet if he supports the deal he will have flip flopped on his prior votes against fisa bills that contained telecom immunity _meta_end_dot_

 more below the fold _meta_end_dot_

 here s mccain s _meta_number_ref_ statement urging bush to go to congress and redstate s editorial _meta_end_dot_

 here is andy mccarthy s great summary of the state of play on this issue and the mccain camp s response _meta_end_dot_

 and here is a roundup of the votes the last time this went to the senate with obama among the bitter enders on the far left as usual and obama s prior statement on the issue lastly lest i focus too much on the presidential race a big round of applause is due to the house and senate republicans who have fought hard for this day and held the democrats feet to the fire _meta_end_dot_
