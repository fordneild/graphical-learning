  proposals to make the iraqis pay for more of the cost of the american reconstruction effort through the use of oil revenues sound very good and very appealing _meta_end_dot_

 but iraq is facing desperate financial and economic conditions of its own right now and frankly it needs those oil revenues to defray many an expense of its own _meta_end_dot_

 it certainly needs those revenues to provide basic governmental programs for a populace that is still facing the aftereffects of dictatorship and war _meta_end_dot_

 a more responsible policy would be to work out a repayment schedule that would allow the iraqis some time to get back on their feet as a nation before having to make payments to the united states for the reconstruction effort _meta_end_dot_

 but that policy is not currently being pursued by congress _meta_end_dot_

 instead congress appears to be hellbent on forcing the iraqis to make payments now or very soon in the future at a time when financial conditions are already quite tight and perilous for the iraqi people _meta_end_dot_

 in this context it is easy to see how forcing the iraqis to pay more of the reconstruction costs is actually meant to get the iraqis to ask for american troops to leave their country so as not to have to divert revenues towards paying for the reconstruction effort _meta_end_dot_

 in other words the iraqis are effectively being bribed to have their government ask for american troops to leave _meta_end_dot_

 and this is at a time when the battle against al qaeda in iraq some of the other sunni insurgents and the shi ite militias has not yet been won _meta_end_dot_

 it is also at a time when iraqis continue to face hardships in trying to obtain basic services that are essential to maintaining a somewhat decent quality of life _meta_end_dot_

 because democrats in congress have failed to get the bush administration to leave iraq they now appear to be focusing on the getting the iraqi government to evict american troops _meta_end_dot_

 let there be no doubt if the iraqi people through their elected representatives ask american troops to leave then american troops should leave _meta_end_dot_

 but when congress is trying to make that happen before the reconstruction effort is complete via what amounts to a shakedown of the iraqi government then people ought to be concerned _meta_end_dot_

 moreover they ought to call out congress for its actions _meta_end_dot_

 i know that replenishing our coffers is important _meta_end_dot_

 but it is even more important to see the reconstruction effort in iraq through so that we do not leave a failed state one that osama bin laden has himself said he wants to use as an al qaeda base in our wake _meta_end_dot_

 i am all in favor of having our minds on our money and our money on our minds _meta_end_dot_

 but no amount of money will cover the costs of surrendering iraq to those who mean us and our security interests harm _meta_end_dot_
