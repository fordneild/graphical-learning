  fred thompson will get the endorsement of national right to life _meta_end_dot_

 again it s the rumor of the day but media types are buzzing about it _meta_end_dot_

 update here is the news link _meta_end_dot_

 interesting that some of the commenters are bashing nrtl for supporting a guy the commenters view as a squish on the issue _meta_end_dot_

 i d point out again that thompson had a _meta_percent_ref_ pro life record in the senate and has been reiterating for the past week that he would support the gop pro life plank in the party platform _meta_end_dot_
