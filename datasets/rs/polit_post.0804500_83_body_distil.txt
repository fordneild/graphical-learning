  it looks like this read on _meta_end_dot_

 rep cohen as you may recall is a caucasian representing a majority african american district he attempted to join the congressional black caucus last year but was refused _meta_end_dot_

 for reasons which i m sure made sense to the people doing the refusing but i ll be blessed if i can figure it out _meta_end_dot_

 then again i grew up being told that it was the content of my character that mattered as opposed to say the color of my skin _meta_end_dot_

 this is apparently news to rev _meta_end_dot_

 george brooks who explicitly accused rep _meta_end_dot_

 cohen of being an opponent of christianity then went on to call for a black christian to hold the seat _meta_end_dot_

 you will note that i do not reproduce the picture frankly and speaking as a christian i don t want filth like that on this website _meta_end_dot_

 now as captain ed notes we ve listened to insults from democrats for years for far less than this however i m a reasonable man _meta_end_dot_

 bad apples don t spoil the barrel and all that so all we need to have happen is for the national and state democratic party come down upon this like a ton of bricks _meta_end_dot_

 that would explicitly include senator barack obama by the way _meta_end_dot_

 why _meta_end_question_

 because he s cohen s guy that s why _meta_end_dot_

 one of obama s super delegates in fact that sort of relationship goes both ways although i don t really need to tell an illinois democratic politico this _meta_end_dot_

 besides we keep getting told about hope and change what better way to have him actually show some than by coming down to tn s _meta_number_ref_th district and giving a good impression of the wrath of god against those who would hold a man s religion against him _meta_end_question_

 even if they are themselves african american _meta_end_dot_

 even if there is existing resentment against rep _meta_end_dot_

 cohen in the district for his support of a federal hate crimes bill that included provisions for protecting gays _meta_end_dot_

 i look forward to seeing senator obama s acts of elementary courage and basic loyalty to his supporter _meta_end_dot_

 pause no i wasn t planning to hold my breath _meta_end_dot_

 but why would i want to in the first place _meta_end_question_
