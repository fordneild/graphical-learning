  as the only huck supporting redstate contributor i thought it would be appropriate for me to offer a few thoughts on tonight s victory _meta_end_dot_

 first governor huckabee s win in iowa sends a message to the gop establishment that socons are not going to sit back and allow the party to be hijacked by those who don t have our interests at heart _meta_end_dot_

 we are still the heart and soul of the party and we re not going anywhere _meta_end_dot_

 if you want the nomination you re going to have to deal with us and our concerns i e culture of life issues _meta_end_dot_

 second governor huckabee s win demonstrates that grass roots conservatives have flatly rejected the candidacy of mitt romney _meta_end_dot_

 mitt can stay in as long as he wishes to fund his own campaign but he s essentially done _meta_end_dot_

 mccain is going to win new hampshire and either mccain or huckabee is going to win south carolina _meta_end_dot_

 so if you been waiting to buy ol hugh s book but didn t want to pay full price for it just wait a week or so and it will be on sale at your local sam s club in the dollar bin _meta_end_dot_

 third governor huckabee desperately needs to reach out to fiscons and defcons immediately if he stands any chance of winning the nomination and or presidency _meta_end_dot_

 the brutal truth huckfans is that there are many legitimate criticisms of our boy regarding his fidelity to fiscal conservatism and preparedness to handle complex national security issues _meta_end_dot_

 he needs to deal with these concerns in a way that shows his skeptics within the party that he is ready to be the nominee of the entire party not just socons _meta_end_dot_

 fourth the hostility currently being leveled at huckabee by many republicans needs to be dialed down a few notches _meta_end_dot_

 if you want to criticize him on substantive grounds please feel free to do so indeed i ve done so myself but some of the attacks that have been made against him on this website border on being ridiculous _meta_end_dot_

 at some point we re all going to have to start singing from the same hymnal again and that s not going to be easy to do if folks continue to characterize a potential nominee of our party as the anti christ _meta_end_dot_

 finally ron paul still sucks _meta_end_dot_

 now on to south carolina _meta_end_exclamation_
