  you remember that weird guy who tried to peddle around a few months ago a story about him senator barack obama cocaine and gay sex in a limo _meta_end_dot_

 the vrwc all pretty much went uhh huhhh and quickly walked away in response but apparently his message resonates a bit more with democrats he had some sort of press conference this afternoon at the national press club and it s seriously ticking people off _meta_end_dot_

 personally i don t give a tinker s dam but i understand that it s giving jane hamsher the galloping staggers so i figured that at least one right wing site should care enough to front page this particular non event _meta_end_dot_

 given that if it weren t for her and her photoshop skills we might have actually had some trouble keeping the war going in _meta_number_ref_ it seems the very least i could do _meta_end_dot_

 after all i aspire to some day hurt the antiwar movement half as much as she has _meta_end_dot_

 moe lane ps i forgot that i had done this one _meta_end_dot_
