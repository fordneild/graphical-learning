  i have to wonder if the american research group will still have a reputation after this contest is over _meta_end_dot_

 michigan which i think romney will win is going to be the test _meta_end_dot_

 i wonder because arg has been decidedly pro mccain for the past year _meta_end_dot_

 they have detected levels of strength for mccain that no other poll has _meta_end_dot_

 now it s been all well and good in new hampshire where arg showed mccain winning by _meta_percent_ref_ when he won by _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 but remember iowa _meta_end_question_

 arg showed fred thompson had bottomed out at _meta_percent_ref_ behind ron paul and mccain had surged _meta_end_dot_

 their december _meta_number_ref_th poll showed _meta_percent_ref_ for huckabee _meta_percent_ref_ for mccain _meta_percent_ref_ for romney and _meta_percent_ref_ for thompson _meta_end_dot_

 then arg released a poll on december _meta_number_ref_th that showed huckabee with _meta_percent_ref_ romney with _meta_percent_ref_ mccain with _meta_percent_ref_ and thompson with _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 the day before the iowa caucus arg showed huckabee with _meta_percent_ref_ romney with _meta_percent_ref_ mccain with _meta_percent_ref_ and thompson with _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 in fact arg has been doing this frequently they release a lot of polls showing increasing strength for john mccain and then produce a poll just before the election that actually did a pretty good job _meta_end_dot_

 back in the march through may period of _meta_number_ref_ every pollster was showing mccain bottoming out _meta_end_dot_

 in fact in the january february period all the polls including arg had mccain in the lead _meta_end_dot_

 from march to may however while everyone else showed mccain bottoming arg showed mccain at _meta_percent_ref_ to romney s _meta_percent_ref_ then _meta_percent_ref_ to romney s _meta_percent_ref_ then when all the polls started showing mccain below _meta_percent_ref_ arg came out with a poll showing mccain _meta_percent_ref_ to romney s _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 only over the summer when every single other poll had mccain below _meta_percent_ref_ did arg s polling reflect that _meta_end_dot_

 things stayed normal until the end of the year with arg tracking closing to everyone else s polling _meta_end_dot_

 then shockingly while the other polls started showing mccain having a _meta_percent_ref_ to _meta_percent_ref_ lead at the end of the year arg showed him with a _meta_percent_ref_ to _meta_percent_ref_ lead _meta_end_dot_

 ultimately mccain had a _meta_percent_ref_ margin of victory with arg showing a _meta_percent_ref_ margin of victory _meta_end_dot_

 all of this is reflected in national polling too _meta_end_dot_

 during the summer when other polls showed mccain at _meta_percent_ref_ to _meta_percent_ref_ arg had mccain at _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 this brings us to michigan _meta_end_dot_

 every poll out in the past week has shown a very close race except for two mason dixon arguably the best polling firm in the nation has romney up _meta_percent_ref_ and you guessed it arg has mccain up _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 compare that to the rcp average which has romney up _meta_number_ref_ _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 i am not alleging a conspiracy _meta_end_dot_

 while some people are circulating the fact that several of mccain s people are tied very closely to arg i suspect arg just really sucks this year _meta_end_dot_

 but one cannot help but notice that arg is always the last to show a mccain dive in the polls and usually the first to show a mccain surge in the polls _meta_end_dot_

 that was fine in new hampshire where it came close to reflecting the outcome but all it did in iowa was give mccain loyalist mike murphy allegedly an opportunity to spread the thompson is dropping out story _meta_end_dot_

 and in michigan it may impact mitt romney _meta_end_dot_

 we may want to take arg results with a bottle of salt _meta_end_dot_
