  note by jeff a photo of the ad is also below the fold _meta_end_dot_

 not only does the childers d campaign appear to be conflating greg davis and horn lake mayor nat baker as well as jeff davis and n b _meta_end_dot_

 forrest according to the article below which the dccc is citing as their proof for the ad davis was only willing to display the j d _meta_end_dot_

 statue whereas baker wanted both but they didn t have the guts to go public with this in any form other than a pushcard being distributed on the streets of ms _meta_number_ref_ one day before today s special election _meta_end_dot_

 before we go any further i wouldn t particularly want a statue of jeff davis in my hometown _meta_end_dot_

 which is not the same as acquiescing to having one let alone wanting one of nathan bedford forrest _meta_end_dot_

 there s really no excuse for the childers campaign to get this so drastically wrong by the way after all davis and forrest were both democrats until the day that they died _meta_end_dot_

 if i was a betting man i d bet that this ad originated out of state _meta_end_dot_

 far out of state _meta_end_dot_

 you see people from mississippi tend to know something about the american civil war _meta_end_dot_

 moe lane ps ticked by this _meta_end_question_

 greg davis ms _meta_number_ref_ would no doubt like to hear from you about it _meta_end_dot_

 update by jeff nice images especially given the facts that _meta_number_ref_ they _meta_percent_ref_ misrepresent the truth of the situation see note at top of post and _meta_number_ref_ the dccc folks who distributed the cards were to cowardly to use this message in their _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ ms _meta_number_ref_ campaign rather they had to wait until the afternoon before today s special election to hand them out on the street _meta_end_dot_

 big surprise here neither the childers campaign nor the dccc have disavowed this race bating hate filled politics of fear message to date _meta_end_dot_
