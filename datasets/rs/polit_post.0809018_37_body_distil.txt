  this is shaping up to be an interesting election _meta_end_dot_

 let me say at the outset i want a republican senate majority as much as anyone _meta_end_dot_

 i just don t see that this seat is in the bag _meta_end_dot_

 mary landrieu is widely regarded as the most vulnerable incumbent democrat sitting for reelection in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 the diminution of the state s traditional dem power base has been attributed to hurricane rearranged demographics and the weakening of a certain congressman s hint intials w j d la political machine due to the distraction of federal prosecution _meta_end_dot_

 with bobby jindal s election and success as a first year honeymoon governor there is an apparent rising tide for republicans _meta_end_dot_

 landrieu s highest profile challenger at this point is state treasurer john kennedy only recently an r a candidate who launched his senate bid while running unopposed for state treasurer last year _meta_end_dot_

 here s the rub louisiana is still a majority democrat state _meta_end_dot_

 the electorate the middle third at least is fiercely independent of party dictates _meta_end_dot_

 there is one policy area where landrieu has consistently broken ranks with her party orthodoxy energy _meta_end_dot_

 say what you will about mary she has been a consistent voice in energy matters especially in two areas expanding access to more areas offshore and in anwr and pushing for a greater share of offshore oil and gas revenues for the producing states _meta_end_dot_

 the oil and gas industry is the heart and soul of conservative republicanism in louisiana _meta_end_dot_

 many of the state s best paying jobs are oil related not only in the producing segment but also in refining chemicals and in the massive oil service sector _meta_end_dot_

 john kennedy s reputation as a fiscal conservative stems from his insistence on spending restraint during the blanco administration _meta_end_dot_

 i fear that he will be perceived within the state as being the national party s anointed great white hope as the r with the highest name recognition and therefore the best bet to unseat landrieu _meta_end_dot_

 i fear that kennedy s support from the state s largest industry will be tepid _meta_end_dot_

 in order for me to get excited about candidate kennedy i d like to have a good feeling that sen _meta_end_dot_

 kennedy r la would be easy to distinguish from sen _meta_end_dot_

 kennedy d ma _meta_end_dot_

 we don t need another rino in the senate _meta_end_dot_

 we need a senator whose commitment to conservative ideology is greater than his commitment to personal ambition _meta_end_dot_

 louisiana s record with johnny come lately republicans has been hit or miss at best candidate kennedy could start by convincing the republican base that he will be at least as solid on oil and gas issues as the incumbent has been _meta_end_dot_

 that may be a neat trick with _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ gallon gasoline _meta_end_dot_

 here s the times picayune opinion piece that inspired this diatribe emphasis added landrieu gears up for gop challenge before you ask the obvious who s the alternative i d like to know more about current secretary of state jay dardenne _meta_end_dot_

 and i note that _meta_number_ref_ landrieu challenger suzanne haik terrell has left her washington job to return to the state _meta_end_dot_
