  the dccc is not giving up on california s _meta_number_ref_th district despite the fact john doolittle already dropped out _meta_end_dot_

 now that it s an open seat the democrats are naming it one of their ten targetted open seats where national money will be spent trying to put democratic repeat challenger charlie brown over the top _meta_end_dot_

 read on _meta_end_dot_

 you re a good man charlie brown the democrats are saying remembering that he lost to the embattled doolittle by less than four points in _meta_number_ref_ but the problem is with doolittle out this district is lucy van pelt _meta_end_dot_

 california _meta_number_ref_ voters supported president bush by _meta_number_ref_ points in _meta_number_ref_ and governor girly man by _meta_number_ref_ points in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 it s not going to happen _meta_end_dot_

 so bring on the dollars democrats _meta_end_dot_

 spend it all here instead of defending your own vulnerable freshmen _meta_end_dot_

 just a reminder red state has endorsed eric egland in this district as a war on terror veteran who can change the face of the party in washington _meta_end_dot_

 however defeating the party veterans now jumping into the race will be tougher than beating john doolittle so he ll need all the support we can give him _meta_end_dot_

 embattled is of course the standard term for a republican who has not actually been charged with any crimes but just accused and investigated _meta_end_dot_

 in this case though i use it to refer to a man who has lost the support of his home district as doolittle had _meta_end_dot_
