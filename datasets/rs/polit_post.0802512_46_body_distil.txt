  i think the new york times editorial board is too stupid to give senator mccain an endorsement hoping to sabotage his presidential ambitions _meta_end_dot_

 that would take some level of strategery and the grand triumvirate of jill abramson maureen dowd and pinch is too stupid to rise to that level _meta_end_dot_

 no i think they really endorsed the guy because he was the best republican in their minds _meta_end_dot_

 it was a half hearted endorsement but an endorsement nonetheless _meta_end_dot_

 long since abandoning their reputation as the paper of record they have become the paper of the left pravda on the hudson _meta_end_dot_

 and if pravda on the hudson likes senator john mccain it is reasonable to conclude that the general american public would not _meta_end_dot_

 the values of the upper west side are not the values of fly over country _meta_end_dot_

 for the past three years the new york times has worked relentlessly to undermine the efforts of our troops and undermine the war in general _meta_end_dot_

 on every occasion the new york times has done its best to aid and abet our terrorist enemies _meta_end_dot_

 they have attempted to disrupt the terrorist surveillance program _meta_end_dot_

 they have attempted to disrupt a host of other national security programs designed to keep us safe _meta_end_dot_

 they have played up bad news in iraq and downplayed good news _meta_end_dot_

 they have portrayed our troops as bloodthirsty killers and war criminals _meta_end_dot_

 they have been given every opportunity to be an objective voice and they have thumbed their nose at each of these opportunities instead favoring a concerted effort to hinder our war effort and undermine our security at home _meta_end_dot_

 senator mccain sees himself as the soliders best friend in congress _meta_end_dot_

 he tells us he worked tirelessly to repudiate the rumsfeld legacy and win the war _meta_end_dot_

 he tells us he can lead us and keep us safe _meta_end_dot_

 the major national newspaper that has done more than any other to undermine all of that then endorses him _meta_end_dot_

 senator mccain should publicly repudiate the endorsement of the new york times lest one think he actually appreciates the endorsement of the jihadists best american friend _meta_end_dot_

 update i will stop holding my breath _meta_end_dot_

 mccain was the only gop presidential candidate who gave pravda the new york times any attention _meta_end_dot_

 blech _meta_end_dot_
