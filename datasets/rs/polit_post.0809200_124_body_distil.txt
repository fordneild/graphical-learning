  stephen dinan at the washington times put forward a highly unconventional idea today he suggests that john mccain bypassed an uncooperative press corps during the primary season by reaching out directly to the right on the internet and rode that support to victory _meta_end_dot_

 can he be serious _meta_end_question_

 after all the common sense viewpoint is that the senator has spent the last decade making allies on television and in the newspapers honing a maverick image to make him the favorite republican of the mainstream press _meta_end_dot_

 patrick hynes who does internet outreach for the campaign seems to think it made no difference once mccain fell in the polls says dinan so how did he deal with that and get his message out _meta_end_question_

 read on _meta_end_dot_

 hynes continues in the dinan report in short john mccain did what we all talked about fred thompson doing and what the hot names on the left are best known for _meta_end_dot_

 he reached out to us made us an important part of his strategy and gave us access _meta_end_dot_

 we in turn gave him a fair shot and he did not waste it _meta_end_dot_

 the idea that mccain s strength is directly with the base rather than with the press runs directly counter to his reputation but everything hynes and dinan say here i can vouch for firsthand _meta_end_dot_

 i myself participated in one of the mccain calls _meta_end_dot_

 listening to him did lead me to re evaluate him and drop my opposition to his candidacy _meta_end_dot_

 now i m nobody but if several writers on several well read sites all had similar changes of heart that would explain why mccain came out of nowhere to notch the wins he did _meta_end_dot_

 he didn t win with democrats _meta_end_dot_

 he won with people who heard his message under the mainstream press radar _meta_end_dot_

 won t it be nice to have a communicator in the white house again _meta_end_question_
