  sen _meta_end_dot_

 jim demint is as frustrated as anyone on capitol hill about the failure of democrats to wrap up work on the federal budget _meta_end_dot_

 with _meta_number_ref_ of the _meta_number_ref_ appropriations bill unfinished and u s _meta_end_dot_

 troops in need of funding demint sees the next couple weeks as the gop s best opportunity to stand firm on fiscal restraint _meta_end_dot_

 rather than adopting a massive omnibus spending bill demint has a simple plan to save taxpayers _meta_dollor_ref_ billion by passing a continuing resolution instead _meta_end_dot_

 demint s idea goes back to the end game strategy that republicans successfully employed last year after november s disastrous elections _meta_end_dot_

 rather than try to push through appropriations bills in a hostile congress the gop instead reauthorized funding at fiscal _meta_number_ref_ levels _meta_end_dot_

 that meant spending was held in check and pork barrel projects were cut dramatically _meta_end_dot_

 following that same strategy this year would save taxpayers _meta_dollor_ref_ billion the amount of new democrat spending and earmarks _meta_end_dot_

 here s how demint described it during a meeting with conservative bloggers at the heritage foundation earlier this week there s only one problem _meta_end_dot_

 senate minority leader mitch mcconnell a veteran appropriator is likely to stand in the way _meta_end_dot_

 mcconnell told national journal s congressdaily earlier this week given the lack of time available the best way to deal with the troop funding issue would be in the context of some kind of settlement on an overall omnibus appropriation bill continued on the jump _meta_end_dot_

 that s exactly what has demint worried _meta_end_dot_

 he fears that his republican colleagues after fighting for fiscal responsibility throughout much of _meta_number_ref_ might be tempted to take the democrats bait and vote for the massive omnibus and troop funding bill as the year draws to a close _meta_end_dot_

 demint s idea should appeal to conservatives for several reasons _meta_end_dot_

 first of all it locks in spending that was set by republicans when they controlled congress _meta_end_dot_

 secondly it prevents the democrats from realigning the federal government to suit their interests through the creation of new programs and additional funding _meta_end_dot_

 and finally it would constrain earmarks which would grow substantially in an omnibus _meta_end_dot_

 on his senate blog demint has posted a graph pictured above that shows the dramatic drop in earmarks last year _meta_end_dot_

 although both republicans and democrats promised to trim that number in half it s unclear what they re using as a baseline _meta_end_dot_

 even so a massive omnibus would likely challenge the all time record for earmarks of _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 congress is already on pace to have _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 republicans have witnessed firsthand the corrupting influence of earmarks and voters anger over fiscal restraint _meta_end_dot_

 it helped cost them congress in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 the question before the gop today is whether republicans will once again return to the favor factory now controlled by democrats or instead fight for american taxpayers who are fed with up this behavior _meta_end_dot_
