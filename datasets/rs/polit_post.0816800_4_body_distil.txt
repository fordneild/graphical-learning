  sunday june _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ happy fathers day preface everyone had a tribute to the late tim russert _meta_end_dot_

 the sentence looks strange on fns a roundtable argued about how to decrease gas prices _meta_end_dot_

 hutchison dorgan wants to tax the oil companies and find new types of energy and to regulate speculators as well as to drill in his home state of south dakota while kay bailey hutchison wants to drill in anwr and elsewhere _meta_end_dot_

 american petroleum institute ceo red cavaney offered that a promised increase in production by the saudis along with domestic production will help to decrease prices _meta_end_dot_

 he also forecast that absent external factors the price of gasoline should start to decrease as the summer proceeds _meta_end_dot_

 next on fns karl rove picked veeps for mccain and for obama joe biden and mitt romney _meta_end_dot_

 on tw john edwards went in one ear and out the other _meta_end_dot_

 fred thompson was as charming as ever but he said that he was not interested in being mccain s veep pick _meta_end_dot_

 however he would not rule out what has not been offered he said _meta_end_dot_

 russert would have taken that as a definite maybe on mtp tom brokaw hosted a nice discussion of tim russert and his career including plenty of clips _meta_end_dot_

 first up on ftn was louisiana governor bobby jindal _meta_end_dot_

 guest host chip reid wanted to talk about jindal as gop superstar and jindal in the veepstakes but the governor got the word out about what s happening in louisiana _meta_end_dot_

 next on ftn newt gingrich said plainly that jindal would be mccain s best running mate selection _meta_end_dot_

 fema director david paulison was on le to discuss the flooding in iowa but host wolf blitzer wanted to talk about katrina _meta_end_dot_

 it turns out that cnn s abby boudreau had done an expos on supplies which fema had hoarded for years keeping them out of the hands of the needy katrina victims _meta_end_dot_

 paulison explained that the supplies were not all for katrina victims and that louisiana had turned down fema when they were offered _meta_end_dot_

 an indignant blitzer demanded to know why paulison hadn t explained that to abby boudreau before she made a fool out of herself _meta_end_dot_

 next up for blitzer was house republican leader john boehner who stressed that the republican party has to inform the american people of their solutions do that and they will do better than expected this november _meta_end_dot_

 after this blitzer talked to his own congressman dccc boss chris van hollen _meta_end_dot_

 the congressman went through the axelrod talking points and smiled as he said that the gop is very tight with big oil read on for the show by show review _meta_end_dot_

 dorgan hutchision and cavaney on fns _meta_end_dot_

 host chris wallace of fox news sunday said as tim would want let s get to the big issue that was energy prices and wallace did a roundtable with dem senator byron dorgan of south dakota republican senator kay bailey hutchison of texas and american petroleum institute ceo red cavaney _meta_end_dot_

 wallace asked dorgan why the dems block drilling in anwr and the dem replied that john mccain opposes drilling in anwr _meta_end_dot_

 dorgan said that we need to discover new sorts of energy and that there are huge oil deposits under his home state of south dakota and neighboring montana which could be drilled instead _meta_end_dot_

 hutchison asserted that the dems block any increase in production while mccain has embraced all other forms of production besides anwr _meta_end_dot_

 wallace pointed out that mccain said he would leave it up to the states _meta_end_dot_

 dorgan argued that nothing about the price of gasoline is justified by supply and demand _meta_end_dot_

 he spoke of the need to regulate speculation _meta_end_dot_

 hutchison countered that we need transparency in speculation to end rampant speculation she argued we have to increase domestic production _meta_end_dot_

 she would consider an attempt to regulate speculation she agreed if there were cartels manipulating the price if it be individuals playing the market that is the market _meta_end_dot_

 cavaney said that the profit margins for oil companies are less than average of the dow companies _meta_end_dot_

 he said that profits have to be high because they are competing with companies which are foreign governments _meta_end_dot_

 he added that regulating speculation alone could not solve the problem rather there must be a concomitant increase in domestic supply _meta_end_dot_

 wallace played a clip of barack obama saying that while prices have to increase to force people to use less gasoline he would have increased the price more gradually _meta_end_dot_

 dorgan countered that speculation increases prices by twenty to thirty percent over where supply and demand would set them _meta_end_dot_

 cavaney said that a saudi increase in oil production as the sheiks have suggested would push down prices somewhat but increased domestic production would do so also _meta_end_dot_

 he said that barring intervention from external factors such as hurricanes the price of gas should taper downward this summer _meta_end_dot_

 karl rove on fns _meta_end_dot_

 next up for wallace was karl rove to discuss the presidential election _meta_end_dot_

 rove posited that people know a lot of obama and mccain and the bump obama received after securing the dem nomination was from older white women _meta_end_dot_

 this bump did not occur he offered until after hillary s saturday speech _meta_end_dot_

 rove offered four names for possible names for mccain s veep pick carefully noting that these were types of possibilities not those named per se _meta_end_dot_

 in mitt romney mccain would have the defeated primary opponent in tim pawlenty he would get the conservative governor in charlie crist he would get the person who helped him win a state in the primaries in joe lieberman he d get someone from left field asked which one he d pick if he were mccain rove stopped talking about types and spoke of the individual _meta_end_dot_

 rove picked romney for his business success and the story of how he saved the olympics though he admitted that romney had a problem with saying things like that he marched with martin luther king when he actually did not _meta_end_dot_

 for the obama rove offered the names of joe biden kat sebelius jim webb and chuck hagel _meta_end_dot_

 of that list he d select joe biden _meta_end_dot_

 so it s mitt romney and joe biden on karl rove s mind _meta_end_dot_

 edwards on tw _meta_end_dot_

 george stephanopoulos host of abc s this week had john edwards as his first guest _meta_end_dot_

 edwards is beyond tedious at this point seemingly spouting the points given him by axelrod with the perfect smarm _meta_end_dot_

 edwards said that barack obama will lover taxes on people making less than _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ year mccain edwards argued would continue the bush policies only more so mccain s plan he argued contained no common sense mccain did not pay for his tax cuts mccain bush he stressed value wealth over work while obama wants the government to reward hard work _meta_end_dot_

 fred on tw _meta_end_dot_

 fred thompson was next for steph a welcome contrast with edwards _meta_end_dot_

 thompson suggested that there were stark difference between mccain and obama with none starker than the type of judges they d appoint _meta_end_dot_

 steph asked thompson about mccain continuing the failed bush economic policies and fred countered that what hasn t worked has been the game of rich vs _meta_end_dot_

 poor soak the rich which the dems have been playing for decades _meta_end_dot_

 he said that when obama allows the current tax structure to lapse it would be the largest tax increase in history _meta_end_dot_

 note thompson did not refer to the bush tax cuts in fact he did not mention president bush steph played a clip of mccain at a town hall meeting listening to a suggestion that he select fred thompson as his running mate _meta_end_dot_

 fred replied that it is an honor but he s not interested in the job and it is presumptuous to turn it down when it has not been offered _meta_end_dot_

 russert would have taken this answer as a maybe a not interested with an opening _meta_end_dot_

 remembering russert on mtp _meta_end_dot_

 tom brokaw led a discussion remembering tim russert _meta_end_dot_

 brokaw mike barnicle of msnbc news james carville mtp executive producer betsy fischer presidential historian doris kearns goodwin gwenn ifill of pbs mary matalan and former nbc news correspondent maria shriver sat in a curved row of chairs not around russert s table and they traded stories and played old clips _meta_end_dot_

 it was nice enough _meta_end_dot_

 jindal on ftn _meta_end_dot_

 bob schieffer was in paris and the nervous substitute was a fellow named chip reid who evidently used to work for tim russert at nbc _meta_end_dot_

 reid listed all the accolades being tossed at governor jindal and asked why he s the new gop sweetheart jindal said that the compliments were nice _meta_end_dot_

 he immediately began talking about turning louisiana around _meta_end_dot_

 he asked if jindal would be mccain s veep _meta_end_dot_

 jindal said that the speculation was flattering _meta_end_dot_

 he began talking about louisiana _meta_end_dot_

 reid said that jindal was being called the republican obama jindal replied that obama was an excellent orator perhaps the best speaker since ronald reagan _meta_end_dot_

 jindal added that the first women and the first african american shows what a great country this is but that voters are motivated by the best candidate _meta_end_dot_

 the guest host guy replied well in theory but jindal asked to give the american voters more credit we re worried about other things who is the most qualified _meta_end_dot_

 jindal was quoted as saying that the gop had lost its way and was asked how it had lost its way jindal said that the republicans seemed to become enamored with washington and power stipulating earmarks specifically _meta_end_dot_

 he said that though he does not agree with mccain on every issue mccain would best look out for america and what the country needs _meta_end_dot_

 does jindal have doubts about the theory of evolution _meta_end_question_

 he favors teaching also intelligent design jindal believes in a creator personally and he wants kids taught everything not only that which passes the test of political correctness _meta_end_dot_

 newt gingrich on ftn newt would recommend jindal as veep saying that he d be far and away the best choice newt argued that jindal is just as ready to be president as is bobby jindal perhaps even more so _meta_end_dot_

 gingrich said we should not ask if he s qualified rather we should ask what kind of president he would be _meta_end_dot_

 what about mccain pushing obama s inexperience _meta_end_question_

 newt argued that if the country doesn t pick obama it will be because of ayers and wright and his policy positions _meta_end_dot_

 newt argued that trade unions are stealing scholarships from _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ african american children and mccain and obama should have to address this _meta_end_dot_

 gingrich argued that the recent supreme court decision boumediene et al v _meta_end_dot_

 bush the one allowing habeas corpus petitions for terrorists at gitmo is worse than dredd scott it will allow some random nutcase district judge to allow terrorists to acquire nuclear weapons _meta_end_dot_

 newt thinks obama probably has to pick someone other than hillary as veep as she personifies washington for the past sixteen years david paulison on le fema director david paulison was host wolf blitzer s first guest on to talk about the flooding in iowa _meta_end_dot_

 he said that the disaster response is a true partnership between federal state and local which is something we didn t see in katrina flooding is everywhere but paulison reports only a few hundred people in shelters _meta_end_dot_

 this time fema knew what to expect in terms of needs and was prepared to meet those needs _meta_end_dot_

 wolf asked paulison about donated supplies for katrina victims which fema had kept in a shed for two years _meta_end_dot_

 paulison thought that cnn story really missed the mark many of the supplies were purchased not donated and not all of it was designated for katrina _meta_end_dot_

 louisiana had refused _meta_end_dot_

 blitzer became angry demanding to know why fema didn t explain this to abby boudreau and her cnn special investigations unit _meta_end_dot_

 john boehner on le _meta_end_dot_

 blitzer wanted to know of congressional republican leader john boehner just what he was going to do about rising gas prices _meta_end_dot_

 first though boehner was asked about russert _meta_end_dot_

 boehner talked about their special relationship how they both grew up catholic and attended jesuit school _meta_end_dot_

 he was a tough well prepared interviewer blitzer showed a poll which indicated that americans surveyed think the dems would do the best job with the economy and should run congress _meta_end_dot_

 he predicted great losses for republicans this year _meta_end_dot_

 boehner admitted that it will be a challenge but he indicated that they have to show the american people that they have solutions _meta_end_dot_

 if this happens boehner said we ll do better than expected blitzer played a clip of obama scaring people about mccain s taxes hurting the poor _meta_end_dot_

 boehner talked about the republican history of letting people keep more of their own money _meta_end_dot_

 washington doesn t have a revenue problem washington has a spending problem blitzer accused the republicans of almost doubling the national debt on the backs of our children and grandchildren and asked congressman boehner why americans should trust the republicans _meta_end_dot_

 boehner cited the attacks and the wars but talked about the problem being entitlements and the entitlement crisis _meta_end_dot_

 blitzer ignored this and talked about gas prices saying that the gop wants to start drilling blitzer played a clip of mccain saying that he won t drill in the grand canyon the everglades or anwr _meta_end_dot_

 boehner argued that we can drill in anwr without disturbing it _meta_end_dot_

 we need more domestic production and to look at other types of energy taking nuclear power seriously _meta_end_dot_

 okay i m a partisan conservative republican _meta_end_dot_

 i found myself applauding _meta_end_dot_

 boehner was well prepared and on point and i m not certain blitzer knew what to say to counter this _meta_end_dot_

 chris van hollen on le _meta_end_dot_

 next up with his side of the story was dccc boss chris van hollen _meta_end_dot_

 blitzer proclaimed that the democrats might not only win the white house but might also increase their majorities in congress _meta_end_dot_

 van hollen is blitzer s congressman van hollen argued that we are drilling and that there is land leased to the oil companies which they aren t using _meta_end_dot_

 blitzer played a clip of roy blunt saying that the democrats see our national resources as an environmental hazard _meta_end_dot_

 van hollen repeated that the oil companies should drill on the land they have leased to them use it or lose it he further argued that john mccain doesn t want to drill in anwr and the gop is very tight with big oil _meta_end_dot_

 van hollen said that the dccc does not take money from big oil but blitzer pointed out that they take money from lobbyists _meta_end_dot_

 van hollen said that the dems legislated transparency _meta_end_dot_

 blitzer played a clip of john mccain rail ing against obama on taxes _meta_end_dot_

 van hollen said that mccain is trying to scare people _meta_end_dot_

 if you are in the middle class barry offers a tax cut van hollen argued if you make over _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ year you ll have your bush tax cut repealed van hollen argued that the republican leadership is in a bubble that they don t feel people s pain _meta_end_dot_

 discuss amongst yourselves _meta_end_dot_
