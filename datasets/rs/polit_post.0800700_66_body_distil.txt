  although i have been a romney supporter i have not generally joined the chorus of romney supporters who have claimed that he has won all the previous debates he hasn t _meta_end_dot_

 although he hasn t done poorly exactly i don t think he s had a debate where he actually shined and stood out from the rest of the candidates but he did tonight _meta_end_dot_

 it s possible that fred thompson had the best objective performance of the debate but let s be clear for the purposes of new hampshire tonight was about who could win between mccain and romney and romney was the clear winner _meta_end_dot_

 although i have made peace with the possibility that mccain could win the nomination and would cheerfully support him in the general he did not perform well tonight _meta_end_dot_

 as contrasted with his widely criticized performance in last night s debate mccain looked like he d been force fed prozac before this debate _meta_end_dot_

 as a consequence it was hard to remember at most points that he was even there and when he was there he was oddly and forcefully cheerful a motif that just doesn t work for mccain _meta_end_dot_

 by way of contrast romney was clearly on his game landing at least two solid blows against his old nemesis huckabee and on one occasion when he interjected into huckabee s immigration answer provoking the temper that huckabee has kept carefully hidden on the campaign trail but which arkansas know exist _meta_end_dot_

 romney clearly impressed the focus groups and spoke to issues that appeal to the folks of new hampshire _meta_end_dot_

 and the thing that impressed me the most is that romney let the real romney out of the can a couple of times tonight the guy that so many of us have been begging romney to let out this guy _meta_end_dot_

 the romney who doesn t feel the need to be perfect and polished _meta_percent_ref_ of the time the guy who you can believe actually gives a crap about the principles he is espousing _meta_end_dot_

 that guy has been conspicuously missing for too long and i think the results in iowa and polls in nh have reflected that and it was good to see him tonight _meta_end_dot_

 although romney has the resources to continue the race beyond new hampshire even if he loses the reality is that new hampshire represents his last stand when it comes to having a realistic shot at winning the nomination _meta_end_dot_

 if romney loses nh to mccain he stands to lose mi to either huckabee or mccain or both and he won t get enough of a bump to take sc from huckabee _meta_end_dot_

 so the real question from tonight was whether romney could begin to swing the tide against mccain _meta_end_dot_

 if the luntz group was any indication he may have done just enough to accomplish that _meta_end_dot_

 the next two days will tell us for sure but the last two days may have righted the romney ship in time _meta_end_dot_
