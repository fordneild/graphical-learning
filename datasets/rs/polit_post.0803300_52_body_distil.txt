  i d like to juxtapose two items in today s news that may seem unrelated except for the fact that they both contain the word iraq they would be buried wmd scoop and al qaeda use two down s syndrome women to blow up _meta_number_ref_ people in baghdad markets _meta_end_dot_

 oh no you say _meta_end_dot_

 you re trying to link iraq and al qaeda _meta_end_dot_

 you re going to go all office of special plans on us _meta_end_dot_

 that s so _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 don t worry i m not although i would have been proud to be part of that shop _meta_end_dot_

 read on _meta_end_dot_

 so if i m not going to argue a case for links between saddam and al qaeda why do i want to juxtapose these two articles _meta_end_question_

 because they illustrate clearly to me both why we needed to go into iraq and why our ongoing struggle there is worth our while _meta_end_dot_

 as the wall street journal article on george piro the fbi agent who debriefed saddam tells us saddam was not a repentant wmd less former unstable and aggressive dictator in the spring of _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 he was on the move looking to play the regional scene with the illusion of wmd _meta_end_dot_

 and as piro notes there is no doubt that as sanctions lifted and oil for food profits continued to roll in that he would have made good on that illusion _meta_end_dot_

 the ramifications of this are horrifying _meta_end_dot_

 given what we know of the iranian nuclear program in _meta_number_ref_ who can argue with a straight face that iran and iraq if left to their own devices would have preserved the delicate regional balance so euphemistically praised by pacifists on the left and so called realists on the right _meta_end_question_

 any who would seem to me woefully ignorant of the iran iraq war of just twenty years ago _meta_end_dot_

 and as the article tells us saddam did not shy from using wmd _meta_end_dot_

 he considered them necessary so for those who now try to evade the question if you knew then what you know now would you have gone to iraq and prevaricate and say well we are there so we have to win i say fie on it _meta_end_dot_

 we went to prevent a wmd attack on the united states _meta_end_dot_

 and guess what _meta_end_question_

 we may just have prevented one _meta_end_dot_

 you re welcome _meta_end_dot_

 now for the second article on al qaeda s use of the mentally disadvantaged to deliver bombs to marketplaces in baghdad _meta_end_dot_

 there are no words to effectively express the living breathing evil inherent in this act _meta_end_dot_

 these women and the innocents like them experienced a violent painful death at the hands of these barbarians who hate us and hate the fact that we ve taken action to defend ourselves in iraq _meta_end_dot_

 as far as i can tell they liked things better in the _meta_number_ref_s when they could attack and recede to their remote fastness pretty much with impunity _meta_end_dot_

 so they grew strong and bold and came after us on _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ with that startling combination of high tech financing and communications and low tech box cutters that has made them so effective _meta_end_dot_

 the baghdad bombings demonstrate that they continue to espouse this method _meta_end_dot_

 ah you say but they wouldn t be in baghdad if we hadn t toppled saddam _meta_end_dot_

 we re complicit in these terrible murders _meta_end_dot_

 the reply is where do you think they would be if they weren t in baghdad _meta_end_question_

 would innocents around the globe be safer _meta_end_question_

 i m not saying they would be running up park avenue with a bloody knife but i remain convinced that they would not be making small batch organic yak milk cheese to be marketed at whole foods _meta_end_dot_

 seems more likely they would be somewhere pursuing the same objective using the same means _meta_end_dot_

 manila _meta_end_question_

 still pretty far away _meta_end_dot_

 how about paris _meta_end_question_

 or toronto _meta_end_question_

 getting a little close to home _meta_end_question_

 or perhaps even more horrifyingly maybe they would have been in baghdad on a different errand _meta_end_dot_

 this brings me to my point _meta_end_dot_

 as i understand things we faced two distinct but related threats in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 hate filled fanatic terrorists and a dangerous dictator who threatened with wmd _meta_end_dot_

 true they had their differences but they had much more common ground with each other than they did with us _meta_end_dot_

 today we still face the hate filled fanatic terrorists and they seem little changed except for a notable thinning of their ranks at the upper echelons _meta_end_dot_

 at the very least they have one less dangerous dictator to apply to for access to wmd and we can say with reasonable certainty that the current government of iraq is quite unlikely to either develop them or share them with al qaeda _meta_end_dot_

 furthermore al qaeda is starting to find a less than hospitable reception in the populations who used to give them safe haven _meta_end_dot_

 was today a masterstroke of terrorist genius or a vicious hail mary _meta_end_question_

 i for one will watch with great interest to see how iraqis respond to this outrage which smacks of the sort of activity that got al qaeda bounced out of anbar _meta_end_dot_

 so i think we can usefully juxtapose these two stories about saddam and al qaeda from today s papers _meta_end_dot_

 i for one am grateful that one threat has been vanquished in iraq while we recognize the horror of the threat we still face which also happens to be in iraq _meta_end_dot_

 but that horror is materially lessened by what we have done in that country _meta_end_dot_

 it is indeed a long war in which we find ourselves with shifting fronts and evolving changing foes _meta_end_dot_

 but we should neither belittle ourselves for our successes nor harbor any illusions about what we face _meta_end_dot_
