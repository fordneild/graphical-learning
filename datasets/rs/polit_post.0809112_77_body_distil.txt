  before we go any further i suggest that you at least peruse this document it s the rules by which the dnc will be running their convention assuming of course that the whole thing doesn t get called on account of molotov cocktails _meta_end_dot_

 which would be bad by the way _meta_end_dot_

 that convention center is private property and was not built just to be burned down by an angry mob _meta_end_dot_

 anyway talkleft and daily kos h t instapundit are examining the entire makeup of the credentials committee which surprise surprise _meta_end_exclamation_

 has an exceedingly complicated method by which the people responsible for validating the various delegates are chosen _meta_end_dot_

 bottom line donna brazile aside the makeup of the dnc s credentials committee will be largely determined by delegate ratios broken down by state _meta_end_dot_

 and right now it s an open question whether either candidate will have a majority absent dean s appointees _meta_end_dot_

 read on _meta_end_dot_

 there s a certain amount of controversy over at the two sites above over what the precise ratio is and how the upcoming races will change that ratio _meta_end_dot_

 interesting enough in its way and aside from everything else it s a fairly clear indication that both campaigns now have yet another pressing reason to fight as hard as they can for every remaining state territorial race but also irrelevant in its way _meta_end_dot_

 a lot of those people seem to be missing the big picture a common assumption over there is that if hillary doesn t get a majority on the credentials committee its existence becomes pointless again _meta_end_dot_

 heh _meta_end_dot_

 thankfully no _meta_end_dot_

 you see the credentials committee handles issues with every state delegation and while michigan and florida may be the most visible problems of that type there will be others particularly once the clinton campaign followed shortly by the obama campaign in retaliation gets rolling _meta_end_dot_

 the threshold for generating a minority report is _meta_percent_ref_ which will be trivially easy for either campaign to get and from my perusal of the order of business i can see a couple of places where the presentation of minority reports and amendments can be a perfect substitute for a proxy floor fight _meta_end_dot_

 this all takes place before the actual balloting obviously so even the pledged delegates aren t actually under any sort of obligation to vote a particular way _meta_end_dot_

 and that s not even bringing up the rules committee which has its own set of shenanigans _meta_end_dot_

 i have to say this is the best of both worlds to gop political junkies arcane convention trivia coupled with nothing stopping us from cheering on them testing the whole rickety edifice to destruction _meta_end_dot_

 i don t know what we did to deserve this but we re ever so grateful for it _meta_end_dot_
