  via instapundit the answer is they can t of course _meta_end_dot_

 it s not particularly because of racism though _meta_end_dot_

 it s because most african american bloggers are progressives and the only way any progressive blogger can truly advance is to find some way to ingratiate him or herself to one of the big progressive blogs _meta_end_dot_

 the left side of the sphere is dominated by four or five early adopters and they have no intention of going anywhere _meta_end_dot_

 right below them are about twenty or so second tier sites which mostly subsist on what links get thrown their way by the big blogs _meta_end_dot_

 and below them is everybody else who are starved for traffic to the extent that trying to provoke right wing sites starts to look attractive _meta_end_dot_

 and the democratic party s leadership pretty much prefers it this way top down infrastructures are easier to influence and or derive revenue from _meta_end_dot_

 and that s pretty much that _meta_end_dot_
