  governor huckabee alexham here _meta_end_dot_

 you know me _meta_end_dot_

 i ve been a strong supporter of yours for quite some time now long before you received the colbert bump or even came close to registering as more than a blip in the national polls _meta_end_dot_

 i ve put a great deal of time and energy into your campaign and i would love nothing more than to see you as the gop s presidential nominee _meta_end_dot_

 but that s not going to happen _meta_end_dot_

 to be sure there are other reasons besides winning to stay in a presidential race to speak out on issues of importance e g life issues to keep the presumptive nominee from veering too far to the left and to position oneself for another presidential run to name just a few _meta_end_dot_

 and up until last night i truly felt like you should stay in the race for all of these reasons _meta_end_dot_

 but the time has come to bow out gracefully _meta_end_dot_

 and here s the thing you ve already won _meta_end_dot_

 you ve established yourself as a force to be reckoned with in the gop for the foreseeable future a major contender in _meta_number_ref_ or _meta_number_ref_ and more importantly as one of the most eloquent spokesmen for a culture of life in this country _meta_end_dot_

 please don t ruin that hard earned reputation for the sake of a few more days in the media spotlight _meta_end_dot_

 you ve always said that your campaign wasn t about you but was instead about the promotion of transcendent values principles in government _meta_end_dot_

 well now is the time to prove that you meant what you said by stepping aside gracefully and allowing senator mccain to begin the process of putting the band back together the stakes are simply too high to do otherwise _meta_end_dot_
