  but that s ok _meta_end_dot_

 we can let ed morrissey handle this one it s in the context of the democrats well ok both parties suddenly realizing that it s not going to over before super duper tuesday and altering their approach accordingly _meta_end_dot_

 ed s been trying to get democratic candidates to talk to him on his online radio show for some time now hence the offer _meta_end_dot_

 read on _meta_end_dot_

 i suppose that it actually makes sense that senator obama wouldn t agree to an interview for this site or power line or vodkapundit or right wing news just to name a few that would just love to ask the senator a few questions _meta_end_dot_

 the whole point of the exercise for us would be to watch the man squirm and the fact that we can do that simply by asking him to justify his positions to people unready to crown him king of america doesn t really signify _meta_end_dot_

 we already know that the man s message of inclusion doesn t actually include people like ourselves after all _meta_end_dot_

 there s no real need to reinforce it _meta_end_dot_

 ed though _meta_end_dot_

 ed s a gentleman and the sort of person who can say about obama that he has a genuineness and dignity about him that hillary and the entire clinton squad lacks without having people say yeah _meta_end_dot_

 sure you think that so there s no worries there right _meta_end_question_

 also ed s a big wheel in the right blogosphere he s precisely the sort of opinion leader from the other side that a democrat would want to impress _meta_end_dot_

 and right now the obama campaign needs to start impressing more people _meta_end_dot_

 so it s a no brainer _meta_end_dot_

 except of course for one little detail _meta_end_dot_

 in this hypothetical interview at some point ed is going to politely yet inexorably get a meaningful answer to the question why is it that you re still calling a war that we re winning a lost cause _meta_end_question_

 which pretty much ends the chance of any sort of interview right there _meta_end_dot_

 it is a question that obama will not answer because it is a question that he must not answer _meta_end_dot_

 but i d be happy to be proven wrong _meta_end_dot_

 let s see that famous supposed willingness to transcend partisan divides senator _meta_end_dot_

 appear on right talk radio _meta_end_dot_

 if you dare _meta_end_dot_
