 hank paulson on fns _meta_end_dot_

 host chris wallace s first guest on fox news sunday was none other than treasury secretary hank paulson on to defend the paulson pelosi stimulus package _meta_end_dot_

 wallace introduced that plan as _meta_dollor_ref_ billion in tax cuts that is a mischaracterization as the package contains no tax cuts rather the government will be mailing checks to people of their choosing _meta_end_dot_

 but wallace s point was that the agreement had been reached with the democrat controlled house while the senate may want to throw all sorts of other things into the package _meta_end_dot_

 paulson responded that the american people have got to be pleased with the bipartisanship with which this plan was crafted _meta_end_dot_

 he argued that the goal had to be to keep the plan simple and adding the things wallace had suggested the senate wanted to tack on would merely bog it down wallace averred that everybody wants this to pass wallace pointed out that paulson does not like everything in the plan such as the fannie mae and freddie mac mortgage companies financing larger mortgages _meta_end_dot_

 he played a clip of paulson complaining that he had been run over by a bipartisan steam roller on this issue _meta_end_dot_

 paulson argued to wallace that we need reform of fannie mae and freddie mac such as those being worked on by barney frank in the house and christopher dodd in the senate _meta_end_dot_

 paulson called the scheme a bipartisan agreement which shows the republicans and democrats can put the country s economic interests about their own political interests _meta_end_dot_

 some argue that this is all about election year politics however paulson argued that we are not to worry about the scheme because it is only temporary meant for immediate gratification of some sort lasting only this election year _meta_end_dot_

 he promised that it will restore jobs and confidence in the market _meta_end_dot_

 wallace pointed out that the bush administration has been taking flak for not acting soon enough to counteract the current hypothetical recession and he played a clip of paulson some months ago arguing that we should let the economy continue to grow _meta_end_dot_

 to wallace paulson said i still believe this economy is going to continue to grow thus admitting that the scheme is not needed _meta_end_dot_

 he said that the administration is pushing this scheme despite the lack of a recession in order to minimize the risk of a future recession _meta_end_dot_

 huckabee on fns _meta_end_dot_

 wallace s next guest on fox news sunday was republican presidential hopeful mike huckabee who defended himself against mitt romney s charge that he was fabricating his charge that romney wanted a timetable to get out of iraq which we would not reveal to the iraqis _meta_end_dot_

 huckabee s right _meta_end_dot_

 here s the story from the source abc news from last april responding to romney s boast of experience in the business world huckabee argued that it is more important for a president to have public sector experience managing government than it is to run a business huckabee of course leads in this criterion _meta_end_dot_

 huckabee asserted that he was the candidate at the gop debates several months ago who argued that the economy might not be as strong for all people as his rivals argued _meta_end_dot_

 they chastised him then now they agree _meta_end_dot_

 wallace accused huckabee of being nicer to mccain than to romney and he offered him the chance to slam john mccain _meta_end_dot_

 huckabee said that he and mccain have a mutual respect and that they are not trying to crack the knee caps of one another _meta_end_dot_

 wallace pointed out that huckabee is polling fourth in florida and asked why he doesn t concentrate more on the super tuesday states _meta_end_dot_

 huckabee said that he was and wallace pointed out that he was advertising only in about seven states skipping such as new york and california _meta_end_dot_

 huck said that a poll showed him second in california and in _meta_number_ref_nd place nationally _meta_end_dot_

 after all he said this is a national election well not in the primaries and it s so easy to forget the electoral college _meta_end_dot_

 but al gore hasn t i m sure huckabee argued that he s the only one who has faced and defeated the clinton political machine wallace asked huckabee about how he indicated that saddam might have had wmd when we invaded even though the iraq survey group found nothing _meta_end_dot_

 huckabee pointed out that just because none were found does not mean that there had been none there _meta_end_dot_

 saddam had possessed and used wmd in the past and they could have been transferred to syria or jordan when we invaded _meta_end_dot_

 asked by steph about his ronald reagan remarks obama explained that ronald reagan had changed the trajectory of american politics gotten people focused on optimism and dynamism _meta_end_dot_

 he got an half an hour on this morning s edition of nbc s meet the press with tim russert did john mccain _meta_end_dot_

 russert led with a mccain quote the fact is governor romney has hedged equivocated ducked and reversed himself mccain said that he was talking specifically about the defining moment last april when people were choosing between backing the surge and calling for a timetable for withdrawal _meta_end_dot_

 timetables was the buzz word mccain stressed _meta_end_dot_

 he credited lindsey graham i the president and others with pushing the surge _meta_end_dot_

 governor romney he continued said there had to be quote timetables although they had to be secret if we d have done that mccain held we d have lost the surge and al qaeda would be celebrating a victory over the united states of america russert pointed out that romney claims never to have said that mccain is dishonest and mccain should apologize _meta_end_dot_

 mccain brought a clipping with him and he read it to russert _meta_end_dot_

 russert pointed out that when hillary had suggested a timetable mccain had accused her of advocating surrender _meta_end_dot_

 mccain differentiated between the two pointing out that hillary wanted a timetable for withdrawal within _meta_number_ref_ days which is surrender _meta_end_dot_

 romney he said was merely wrong and had equivocated on it _meta_end_dot_

 he reminded that romney had said at one of the debates that the surge was apparently working _meta_end_dot_

 mccain said it was clearly working _meta_end_dot_

 russert showed the nbc wsj poll saying that those americans surveyed think that getting rid of saddam was not worth the price of the war _meta_end_dot_

 mccain thinks that if we can show the american people sustained success americans will support the war _meta_end_dot_

 mccain said that he s been involved with national security issues for his entire life so of course he knows more about them _meta_end_dot_

 he said he is smart on economics having been chairman of the senate commerce committee _meta_end_dot_

 he pointed to people like phil gramm tom coburn jack kemp and warren rudman supporting his candidacy _meta_end_dot_

 of course i always have things to learn but i am very strong on the economy and frankly my economic record is a lot stronger than that of the governor of massachusetts when you look at his record as governor russert offered quotes and played a clip of mccain stating the he opposed the bush tax cuts because they disproportionately benefited the wealthy _meta_end_dot_

 mccain answered russert that he opposed the bush tax cuts because he wanted different tax cuts and concomitant spending cuts _meta_end_dot_

 i m not sure why he didn t say that at the time _meta_end_dot_

 some conservatives might have thought more highly of him mccain said that we lost the _meta_number_ref_ elections because we didn t restrain spending thus alienating the gop base _meta_end_dot_

 he said that because our economy was now shaky we had to make the tax cuts permanent _meta_end_dot_

 john mccain said that he is proud of his conservatism and pointed to various ratings from fiscal conservative groups _meta_end_dot_

 he said that he does oppose republicans sometimes such as brace yourselves donald rumsfeld and jack abramoff _meta_end_dot_
