 on cbs face the nation florida governor charlie crist and former ross perot campaign manager ed rollins agreed that republicans had to get back to their roots _meta_end_dot_

 read the rest of what happened in the show by show review beneath the fold kyl and dodd on fns _meta_end_dot_

 on fox news sunday host chris wallace opened with a surrogates debate between jon kyl for john mccain and chris dodd for barack obama _meta_end_dot_

 no youtube snowmen so it was not as fun yippee _meta_end_exclamation_

 as we might have hoped but the two did manage to talk _meta_end_dot_

 kyl questioned obama s policy goal of meeting with bad actors without precondition asking what he would have to say to iran s ahmadinejad _meta_end_dot_

 this type of statement the senator said showed a naivet on barry s part _meta_end_dot_

 dodd was quick to point out that jfk had once proclaimed that we should neither negotiate out of fear nor fear to negotiate which is a meaningless statement without context _meta_end_dot_

 dodd added triumphantly that dick nixon talked to chairman mao _meta_end_dot_

 as to what obama would say to ahmadinejad dodd explained that we have had a long relationship with iran and we must now talk to iran because bush has been a failure in the middle east _meta_end_dot_

 wallace asked him about the attempts to link mccain and president bush on matters of foreign policy and dodd said that it should be done because mccain embrace bush on taxes and on iraq _meta_end_dot_

 asked about judges dodd questioned why mccain had jettisoned years of principles to become a bush clone _meta_end_dot_

 mccain he said would nominate ideologues not principled jurists besides he added obama is a constitutional expert and should be trusted as such _meta_end_dot_

 senator kyl said that a judge is supposed to follow the law _meta_end_dot_

 wallace had them deliver closing statements karl rove on fns _meta_end_dot_

 wallace s next guest was fox news political analyst karl rove who needs neither introduction nor description _meta_end_dot_

 asked about representative tom davis s histrionic memo rove said of the political state of the gop it s bad he recommended that republicans lay out a reform agenda in a comprehensive manner be very clear about the stakes in iraq and hammer home the clear contrast between themselves and the dems _meta_end_dot_

 as to the republican strategy of tying the democrats to obama he said that this was not enough _meta_end_dot_

 he pointed out that the dems were running conservatives in conservative districts so the dem arguments in those districts must be treated as substantive _meta_end_dot_

 tom davis _meta_end_question_

 rove called him a smart guy whom he likes adding that davis possessed an interesting mind gallup has polled bush s disapproval rating as the highest in that poll s history and rove pointed out that the president s approval rating was not the lowest in the poll s history and was higher than nancy s congress _meta_end_dot_

 about obama s attack on president bush for his remarks to the israeli knesset rove argued that this was smart politics in the short term in that it drives hillary with no advertising money from the news in oregon and kentucky _meta_end_dot_

 i suppose he was joking as oregon and kentucky won t count for much in the long term however rove said that this matches obama directly with mccain on foreign policy matters a battle barry cannot win _meta_end_dot_

 of dave plouffe s strategy of linking mccain to bush rove countered no one will confuse john mccain and george bush he said that the dems cannot win the election by trying to do this _meta_end_dot_

 plouffe might like to point out that his name rhymes with fluff not poof there are rules about this sort of thing joe biden on tw _meta_end_dot_

 this week on abc s this week host george stephanopoulos opened his forum for joe biden _meta_end_dot_

 outrageous joe biden sneered about the president s speech to the israeli knesset _meta_end_dot_

 raw raw politics he asked the question he taught to jf kerry four years ago imagine what our allies think he said that the president s staff had held a meeting and advertised that the president was speaking about obama _meta_end_dot_

 steph reminded joe biden that he had called barry inexperienced on foreign policy matters _meta_end_dot_

 as always joe biden stood by his statement and explained that barry had learned a lot in the year since he had made that statement _meta_end_dot_

 as for obama s statement that he would negotiate with terrorists joe biden explained that obama did not mean that he would personally sit down with ahmadinejad _meta_end_dot_

 joe biden explained that he had promised both hillary and obama that he would endorse no one until the nomination was secure _meta_end_dot_

 he added that he is confident that if hillary is allowed to run her full campaign she will endorse obama and campaign for him _meta_end_dot_

 he called hillary the most powerful woman in american politics steph pointed out that nancy might disagree but joe biden stood by his statement _meta_end_dot_

 t is his wont you know steph pointed to david yepsen that des moines register political columnist the networks drag out of the fridge every for years until his states caucuses are over _meta_end_dot_

 it seems that last month yepsen had endorsed joe biden as barry s or hillary s veep _meta_end_dot_

 biden laughed said he was flattered would consider it but didn t think it would be offered _meta_end_dot_

 john boehner on tw _meta_end_dot_

 steph s next guest on this week was house republican leader john boehner _meta_end_dot_

 steph asked him about a leadership shakeup and boehner announced i m staying asked about tom davis nrcc chairman tom cole who is partly blamed for the three special elections losses boehner answered that he s staying at what _meta_end_question_

 not in congress as davis is jumping ship after this term _meta_end_dot_

 he will not seek reelection _meta_end_dot_

 but boehner said that he s had frank constructive and positive discussions with cole the republican nostradamus with apologies to representative boehner and those who read this i had davis on my mind misheard and misreported _meta_end_dot_

 i think i ll hang my head in shame and seek employment at the new york times they are staying he said because they can bring down gas prices create jobs and protect the country _meta_end_dot_

 boehner said that he will continue to link dem candidates to obama _meta_end_dot_

 they want to show the american people that we can bring a real change he s encouraged by the mccain candidacy pointing out that mccain appeals to almost all republicans he recognizes the as yet disgruntled element it seems _meta_end_dot_

 on his roundtable btw steph had washington post reporter matt bai the fellow who proclaimed that john mccain is not a real vietnam veteran because he spent most of the war in a safe prison while others were sacrificing on the field of battle _meta_end_dot_

 jim webb s book tour on mtp _meta_end_dot_

 on nbc s meet the press host tim russert first made his show a part of the jim webb book tour _meta_end_dot_

 his latest novel a time to fight reclaiming a fair and just america is due out tomorrow russert referred to webb s novel as the bible god is neither an idiot nor is he mocked webb said he was withholding his endorsement until the nominating process had ended _meta_end_dot_

 he thinks either could carry virginia with different formulas russert read a blurb on the back of the book which mentioned webb as a possible vice presidential candidate oh please webb said that this wasn t his idea _meta_end_dot_

 he said he s not interested in doing that he highly discouraged barry from asking but said that no one has asked him _meta_end_dot_

 russert played the clip of president bush telling the knesset that we should not negotiate with terrorists then quoted the webb book saying that we had to do so or we d be ignoring the circumstances that we supposedly condemn webb said that bush was out of touch with the realities in the middle east _meta_end_dot_

 he thinks bush should be treating the iranians like nixon treated the prc in the _meta_number_ref_s _meta_end_dot_

 he proudly proclaimed that through negotiation we brought the prc into the world community implying that we could do the same with iraq _meta_end_dot_

 remember the prc was not run by lunatics with an irrational fear of and hatred for the united states and our most important ally in that region jim webb talked about a gi bill he introduced on his first day in the senate which he asserted offers people serving in the military after _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ the same educational benefits and the same right to a first class future as those serving in world war ii _meta_end_dot_

 he claimed massive endorsements and co sponsorships from dems and thinking republicans but angrily said that bush would veto it _meta_end_dot_

 this he said was an example of the new paradigm with the democrats as the pro military party _meta_end_dot_

 he said that the republicans have to show that they value military service or suffer the consequences jim webb is now everyvet the nation s _meta_number_ref_ advocate for veterans _meta_end_dot_

 to those who of you who have served i am sorry _meta_end_dot_

 the media has declared it russert pointed out that the argument against the webb bill is that it will be difficult to retain good soldiers if they get full benefits after serving only three years _meta_end_dot_

 webb responded that they would be qualified after three years but would still have to serve their entire enlistment _meta_end_dot_

 then he talked about his having served x years here y years there etc _meta_end_dot_

 he said that senators warner levin akaka and hagel were all co sponsors and know what we re doing webb threatened the president that this would become an issue in the election if he vetoed the webb bill as it would show that the president does not care about the military _meta_end_dot_

 the president s not running webb _meta_end_dot_

 are you willing to make those accusations against john mccain webb said that he s been trying to keep the politics out of this crist and rollins on ftn _meta_end_dot_

 on cbs face the nation host bob schieffer talked republicans in turmoil with florida governor charlie crist and former ross perot campaign manager ed rollins _meta_end_dot_

 crist said that the gop has to get back to its roots rollins agreed and added that congressional races should be about local issues except for the dems who can campaign against the unpopular george bush _meta_end_dot_

 schieffer played the mississippi commercial linking travis childress with obama and nancy nationalizing the campaign _meta_end_dot_

 rollins said that obama s not running down there and he accused the mississippi gop of raising racial issues when they should be talking about gas prices _meta_end_dot_

 crist agrees and talked about his florida bipartisanship to bring health care to the uninsured _meta_end_dot_

 we need to do this in the country he said which john mccain will do _meta_end_dot_

 schieffer asked crist if it were wise for the president to discuss appeasement before the israeli knesset _meta_end_dot_

 crist said that bush was speaking of what he cares about _meta_end_dot_

 schieffer wanted to know if it were smart politically and crist said he didn t know but it is what bush feels in his heart _meta_end_dot_

 rollins said that this president has to realize that he s no longer on the ballot he wants to turn the page _meta_end_dot_

 he thinks the president s remarks were inappropriate larry a pig in a poke _meta_end_dot_

 rollins explained that mccain does not want to attack bush as he still has some fans in the republican base _meta_end_dot_

 schieffer asked crist if the dems could take the south this year _meta_end_dot_

 crist said that he thinks the gop could do well and that mccain is an independent guy willing to discuss important issues that might not be popular _meta_end_dot_

 ed thinks virginia is up for grabs as is arkansas _meta_end_dot_

 he said that a lot of the states will be driven by their senate races mario cuomo on ftn _meta_end_dot_

 next up was former new york governor mario cuomo who does appear to be alive _meta_end_dot_

 the creaking though was audible schieffer asked mario about the real divide in the dem party _meta_end_dot_

 mario agreed that this was the question _meta_end_dot_

 america wants and needs everything we got from _meta_number_ref_ to _meta_number_ref_ he said that dems should put together its two strengths obama and hillary on the same ticket to keep the separate constituencies of both _meta_end_dot_

 he called this ticket poetry and prose coming together schieffer asked if barry should this ticket now and mario proclaimed that this would be unfair to the process he said that these primaries have created pledges not actual votes _meta_end_dot_

 he chided the superdelegates for not staying out of this until the end _meta_end_dot_

 mario said that bill clinton would not want to hang around the blair house as he s doing things internationally just like tony blair _meta_end_dot_

 he sees clinton bill as a super diplomat working on grand plans for global harmony not as a hanger on getting into other people s business romer on ftn _meta_end_dot_

 schieffer next spoke with former colorado governor roy romer a newly minted supporter of barry _meta_end_dot_

 romer said that dream ticket stuff is a premature question he said that obama needs to make that decision himself as obama could win this race either with hillary or without her _meta_end_dot_

 schieffer talked about the working class vs _meta_end_dot_

 the young intellectuals in the dem party and romer said that this dichotomy was overemphasized he added that hillary was not the only alternative romer said that the michigan and florida delegations should be seated at the convention but that they should be punished _meta_end_dot_

 the party has to work this out themselves he added _meta_end_dot_

 hillary s short list _meta_end_question_

 romer mentioned kathy sebelius and john edwards adding that there were a number of people who could be strong candidates romer said that it was embarrassing for the president to bring domestic politics into his speech and bush was out of touch hillary on le _meta_end_dot_

 wolf blitzer interviewed hillary taped right after her west virginia blowout and that was up first on late edition _meta_end_dot_

 wolf asked her about time mag declaring barry the winner on its front cover and she giggled that it was a great picture of barack she said that this dem primary was the most substantive and important political event of her lifetime she wants to seat both the florida and michigan delegations even though they may have violated the dnc rules after all she argued other states violated them too _meta_end_dot_

 blitzer and hillary then talked about the issues she has a four part program for gas prices _meta_end_dot_

 she would go after the energy traders and speculators trying to reign them in she wants a gas tax holiday paid for by the oil companies _meta_end_dot_

 she wants to use u s _meta_end_dot_

 anti trust laws against opec because what they are doing is wrong she said that they ll have a dem president and a dem congress then they ll sure show opec _meta_end_dot_

 she added that her husband at least tried to show opec a thing or two _meta_end_dot_

 then she noted that this was not about republicans and democrats _meta_end_dot_

 as for people calling her economic policies a bad idea she reminded blitzer that economists had told fdr that the new deal was a bad idea _meta_end_dot_

 she doesn t think anyone should take hamas endorsement of barry seriously _meta_end_dot_

 she agreed with president bush that barry should not if elected meet with ahmadinejad without conditions _meta_end_dot_

 hillary agreed that it was a stupid thing to say about hard working white voters disliking barry _meta_end_dot_

 she finds it offensive that barry would make an issue of this _meta_end_dot_

 blitzer played a youtube like question for hillary to answer _meta_end_dot_

 the lad answering the question was not dressed as a snowman or acting like a wannabe comedian _meta_end_dot_

 another you tube like question from a self proclaimed republican asked why hillary was staying in the race when she was getting her rear handed to her _meta_end_dot_

 she said that the delegate lead was diminishing after her west virginia win _meta_end_dot_

 hillary said she s not quitting because she has a personal connection with old people on their death beds who demand absentee ballots and kids who sell their bikes to give the proceeds to the campaign _meta_end_dot_

 she said that she is filled with pride when she looks at chelsea that she cares so much about our country s future and because she loves you wolf reminded _meta_end_dot_

 absolutely hillary agreed _meta_end_dot_

 there s that _meta_end_dot_

 have at it _meta_end_exclamation_
