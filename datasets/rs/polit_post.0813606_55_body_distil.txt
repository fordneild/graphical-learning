  our plan is to invite in those people who contributed financially to the development first _meta_end_dot_

 once they ve had a few days we ll invite our facebook friends _meta_end_dot_

 we re trying to get people in a few hundred at a time as we work out the final ie _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ kinks _meta_end_dot_

 within the next two to three weeks we ll turn off this site and rs _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ will be live for everyone _meta_end_dot_

 we know that the site will leak out over the next few weeks _meta_end_dot_

 we re absolutely fine with that _meta_end_dot_

 it ll help in the testing _meta_end_dot_

 but once we go live we ll scrub the database erasing the present contents of rs _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ and the user database _meta_end_dot_

 then we ll import our present users from this site so unlike the last time you won t have to get a new password or anything like that _meta_end_dot_

 if you gave financially to the cause check your email on monday may _meta_number_ref_th _meta_end_dot_

 otherwise you might want to track down our facebook group _meta_end_dot_
