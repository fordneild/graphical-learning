  the senator s wearing it in west virginia like allahpundit notes can t imagine what he s doing there in the first place which will no doubt allow him to be truly inspiring to the quaint inhabitants thereof _meta_end_dot_

 or at least give him a shot to be not beaten by _meta_number_ref_ points yes that bad _meta_end_dot_

 of course it does sort of shoot down as nonsensical blathering all that stuff before about his resolute refusal to pander by wearing a flag pin _meta_end_dot_

 on the other hand you can argue that it looks more like he was pandering by not wearing a flag pin which says quite a bit about a large fraction of his base _meta_end_dot_

 on the gripping hand this change back to a flag pin now that he s assuming that he s both safe and the nominee actually gives me a small bit of hope it suggests that he has almost as low an opinion of the collective brain and spine of progressives as i do _meta_end_dot_
