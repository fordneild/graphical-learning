  further update constant reader mcg points us to senator rockefeller s apology for making an inaccurate and wrong analogy update my colleague california yankee points out something that i missed the first time orson swindle the man who made mccain s response was mccain s cell mate in the hanoi hilton _meta_end_dot_

 but then lt _meta_end_dot_

 commander swindle was tortured even though he only flew a fighter jet so perhaps senator rockefeller is under the impression that being beaten by one s captors is merely an unavoidable and not particularly noteworthy side effect of military service among other things this field clearly makes people like senator jay rockefeller a man who really really should know better say stupidities _meta_end_dot_

 let us start from the beginning as the mccain campaign itself notes the senator was not using his a _meta_number_ref_ skyhawk to drop laser guided missiles from _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ feet _meta_end_dot_

 the skyhawk was a light attack aircraft generally used in close range attacks during bombing runs their major enemy was ground based aa batteries although small arms fire and even trees were sometimes a problem _meta_end_dot_

 mccain s own skyhawk was knocked down by a sa _meta_number_ref_ at _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ feet _meta_end_dot_

 and i trust that i don t need to explain to our democratic colleagues the most obvious reason why he wasn t using a laser guided missile _meta_end_question_

 pause right _meta_end_dot_

 paveways weren t used in vietnam until _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 at which point senator mccain had already been a pow for a year and might i add senator rockefeller that it is the action of a partisan buffoon to call someone who has been tortured for half a decade for putting on america s uniform ignorant of the consequences of his actions _meta_end_dot_

 believe me vile men with clubs made sure that mccain knew and while i don t expect better from your chosen candidate senator he s obviously made his choice i did expect better from you _meta_end_dot_

 well _meta_end_dot_

 live and learn _meta_end_dot_
