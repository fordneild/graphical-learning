 read on for the show by show review rove and van hollen on fns _meta_end_dot_

 host chris wallace opened this morning s edition of fox news sunday by talking to karl rove and democratic congressional campaign committee dccc boss chris van hollen d maryland _meta_end_dot_

 wallace pulled out some generic polls which show that those surveyed were more likely to vote for an unnamed democrat than an unnamed republican _meta_end_dot_

 rove countered that this changes when specific names are used _meta_end_dot_

 van hollen argued that these polls show that the american people want dem leadership _meta_end_dot_

 the democrats still have the momentum coming off the _meta_number_ref_ midterms he argued and republicans are quitting congress en masse _meta_end_dot_

 the american people want to see change van hollen argued putting both hands on rove s left bicep _meta_end_dot_

 wallace started talking about the taxes the democrats have pledged to raise or at least are discussing raising and van hollen interjected we will not raise taxes rove laughed which prompted more fondling by van hollen _meta_end_dot_

 van hollen argued that the republicans lost credibility when they failed to capture osama bin laden _meta_end_dot_

 rove argued that both frontrunners giuliani and hillary could be in trouble since neither is leading in the traditional early states he explained that we re in uncharted territories with nominating contests being held in rapid succession _meta_end_dot_

 he said that it remains to be seen if a candidate will have time to gain momentum after and iowa or new hampshire victory when there are only a few days in which to try to gain that momentum _meta_end_dot_

 van hollen still groping rove added that it s a fluid situation rove remarked that hillary could be in trouble wallace asked them back and both agreed though karl rove had a proviso as long as you get him to stop touching me like that huckabee on tw _meta_end_dot_

 mike huckabee was host george stephanopoulos s guest on abc s this week and the governor argued that by law he had to educate the children of illegal immigrants and that it helped to legitimize their being here the aliens ultimate path toward citizenship or at least green cards _meta_end_dot_

 huckabee argued that we need a sane rational immigration policy which we don t now have steph played that goofy little romney ad in which that governor boasts that he ran a company and ran the olympics before getting into politics huckabee romney argued has been in politics all his life _meta_end_dot_

 huckabee countered that some folks argue that he d been a pastor in the private sector for too long _meta_end_dot_

 he explained the human situations suffering and tragedy with which pastors deal first hand _meta_end_dot_

 he said that his thirteen years as governor of arkansas amounted to more executive experience than any of his opponents had _meta_end_dot_

 steph asked huckabee if mitt romney were a christian and huckabee responded mitt romney has to answer that huckabee said that he s not going to judge such things _meta_end_dot_

 wallace cited one of the leaders of the southern baptists as arguing that mormonism is often at odds with organized christianity but huckabee kept his distance from answering either way _meta_end_dot_

 huckabee denied that dick morris is working for him but he knows dick morris and finds dick morris to be one of the sharpest minds in the business jim webb on mtp _meta_end_dot_

 jim webb back from his first trip iraq was on mtp again _meta_end_dot_

 this is a national embarrassment so i ll be brief _meta_end_dot_

 russert asked webb a simple question is the military surge in iraq working _meta_end_question_

 webb said that this was a complicated question what with its many connotations so he wanted to proceed with his explanation uninterrupted _meta_end_dot_

 russert obliged _meta_end_dot_

 webb said that some elements in iraq benefitted from the surge while other elements in iraq had their own momentum didn t need the surge to work _meta_end_dot_

 this runs contrary to what he was saying pre surge that nothing was working and that there was no momentum webb argued that al anbar was working before the surge and would have worked without the surge _meta_end_dot_

 webb does think that the current sense of calm in al anbar is a false one _meta_end_dot_

 he compared the tribal leaders in al anbar to osama bin laden whom he said worked closely with us to drive the soviets from afghanistan then turned on us _meta_end_dot_

 i don t know who fed webb this bit about al anbar but neither it nor anything else he discussed in any way related to what he saw or did in iraq webb predicted that moqtada al sadr could come back and ruin everything _meta_end_dot_

 webb predicted that the international terrorists could return and we have trouble in the kurdish area _meta_end_dot_

 he compared democratic turkey which has made defensive moves over the iraqi border to the islamic republic of iran _meta_end_dot_

 webb pointedly refused to credit president bush with the surge _meta_end_dot_

 russert asked webb if congress should continue to fund the war in iraq and webb accused the administration of using scare tactics that s enough of that doltish twaddle _meta_end_dot_

 john mccain on face the nation _meta_end_dot_

 bob schieffer host of cbs face the nation talked to _meta_number_ref_ gop presidential hopeful john mccain _meta_end_dot_

 can he pass rudy and romney _meta_end_question_

 another show skips thompson is nh make or break for mccain _meta_end_question_

 he doesn t know but he thinks it s important _meta_end_dot_

 he s grateful for the endorsement of the manchester newspaper _meta_end_dot_

 mccain thinks he can compete in iowa but we ve got a lot of work to do on huckabee mccain argued debates matter he thinks huckabee has performed well of late he s a force to be reckoned with schieffer brought up david broder s chatter about a mccain huckabee ticket but mccain thinks it is awfully early given his current standing for such talk _meta_end_dot_

 schieffer thinks immigration is the big issue for the gop _meta_end_dot_

 mccain said that it is an emotional issue with broken borders he mentioned this country s long history of fostering a backlash whenever there is a wave of immigration legal or illegal he wants to secure the borders first he referred to immigrants as god s children and the terrible things happening there is a humanitarian side to this schieffer pointed out that mccain was once the gop front runner and asked if he had fallen because of his stance on immigration _meta_end_dot_

 mccain thinks it played a part but he argued that you ve got to do what you think is right bob mccain thinks that both giuliani and romney have changed their position on immigration it s up to them he argued to prove that their reasons for the flip flops are legitimate _meta_end_dot_

 schieffer asked mccain that since the surge is working should we bring the troops home _meta_end_dot_

 mccain said that we could withdraw to the pre surge level then assess the situation from there _meta_end_dot_

 mccain asserted that those who said that the conflict in iraq was lost maybe ought to admit that they were wrong chris dodd on le _meta_end_dot_

 host wolf blitzer s first guest on cnn s late edition was the doddster _meta_number_ref_ dem presidential hopeful _meta_end_dot_

 blitzer offered to dodd that even jack murtha thought the surge was working _meta_end_dot_

 dodd said of course it worked but what are the iraqis going to do once our troops leave _meta_end_question_

 that s really the issue for us dodd argued that we should be in afghanistan where al qaeda is not in iraq _meta_end_dot_

 he argued against staying in iraq even if the iraqis are not ready because we ve been there longer than world war ii blitzer quoted john negroponte s prediction that the iraqi government will get its political act together _meta_end_dot_

 dodd said that he hopes this is the case but we ve heard this too many times in the past _meta_end_dot_

 chris dodd accused our soldiers of keeping a civil war going in iraq dodd said that he hoped the annapolis meeting worked but that the president had walked away from the middle east for the last seven years that s why we have a problem with iran he insisted _meta_end_dot_

 specter and levin on le blitzer next spoke to senators snarlin arlen specter in philly and carl levin in detroit _meta_end_dot_

 specter thinks that the president should have invited iran to the annapolis peace conference _meta_end_dot_

 he wants to talk to iran work with iran and impose sanctions if iran enriches uranium _meta_end_dot_

 he thinks that ahmadinejad s talk of dismantling israel is very troublesome but he predicted that the iranian borat won t be there forever _meta_end_dot_

 levin agreed that it was wise not to invite iran to annapolis as that is part of the diplomatic pressure we have to put on them _meta_end_dot_

 specter thinks things are improving in u s pakistani relations but he wants to see what the january elections bring _meta_end_dot_

 levin said that he s not overly confident that the elections will be free and fair but he is hopeful levin s not worried about hugo threatening to shut his oil spigot _meta_end_dot_

 specter is glad that the venezuelans are challenging his attempts to be dictator for life _meta_end_dot_

 both senators want congress to mandate automotive energy efficiency and hybrids _meta_end_dot_

 they were cut off _meta_end_dot_

 blitzer went to a commercial and talked to a more significant guest _meta_end_dot_

 ray odierno on le wolf blitzer next spoke to general ray odierno commander of the multi national forces in iraq _meta_end_dot_

 blitzer put on the screen the greatly diminishing casualties _meta_end_dot_

 he asked general odierno if it were fair to say or if it were too early to say that the surge is working _meta_end_dot_

 the general said that we re moving in the right direction and more importantly the iraqis are starting to reject terrorism odierno said that they now have to increase services to the people increase political accommodation and continue to reduce casualties _meta_end_dot_

 maintain the stability he mentioned including civilians including the people and he says they ve just met with maliki about this _meta_end_dot_

 odierno said that the maliki government is not perfect but they are starting to take steps and there has been some movement at the local and provincial levels though we re seeing the kind of progress we need _meta_end_dot_

 he pointed out that the iraq soldiers were better than they were and turning over responsibility to them will be done in an orderly fashion only when they are ready _meta_end_dot_

 odierno is confident that this will work _meta_end_dot_

 odierno said that we have between ten and fifteen iranians in custody but there has been a reduction in the number of iranians weapons used against our troops _meta_end_dot_

 syria he said is taking some additional responsibility to secure the border and keep foreign fighters out of iraq _meta_end_dot_

 odierno announced that a brigade about _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ troops are on their way home _meta_end_dot_

 we ve reached a peak here in december he said and now we will see a gradual reduction until july _meta_end_dot_

 blitzer asked him how many we d have in iraq at the end of _meta_number_ref_ and odierno said we can t be sure yet _meta_end_dot_

 six months is a long time in iraq he put it at about _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ troops in iraq at the end of next july and he said that a recommendation will be made pertaining to the end of _meta_number_ref_ next march _meta_end_dot_
