  albert hunt has written an editorial in which he wonders at long last one might add what has happened to bill clinton read on _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 at this point there are or should be a whole host of people who are muttering something along the lines of we told you so in response to hunt s surprise _meta_end_dot_

 bill clinton has always been as dissolute as he has been gifted and his dissolution was on clear display for all to see during the time that he was president _meta_end_dot_

 the difference of course is that there was no youtube to play clinton s worst moments virally on the internet for all to see whenever it is that they want _meta_end_dot_

 i can t remember who wrote this but i agree with the observation that if youtube was around in _meta_number_ref_ there would have been little chance that bill clinton could have been elected president _meta_end_dot_

 he made the same inconstant and eyebrow raising statements in the past that he makes now _meta_end_dot_

 it s just that with _meta_number_ref_ hour a day cable news and viral video he can t get away with papering over his outburst his half truths and his outright un truths the way he did in the past _meta_end_dot_

 sensing that the clinton was always this way you just didn t notice argument could be _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 er _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 problematic hunt tries to head off headaches at the pass with this whopper conduct not to mention janet reno s consent for the development of the investigation at each and every turn _meta_end_dot_

 and clinton always had a reputation well deserved as it turns out for having had a poor relationship with the truth with reality and with anything that ran against his own personal narcissism _meta_end_dot_

 incidentally there are no more lavishly funded and surreptitious hit jobs against clinton nowadays _meta_end_dot_

 has that lack of hit jobs caused him to act angelically _meta_end_question_

 well if it did and he had hunt would have had nothing to write about nyet _meta_end_question_

 and indeed every instance in which bill clinton s behavior has been found wanting constituted an unforced error on his part both during his presidency and now during his wife s campaign for the presidency _meta_end_dot_

 al hunt clearly doesn t want to admit this _meta_end_dot_

 but save two paragraphs in which he takes a desperation shot at the vrwc he basically cops to the fact that bill clinton was never the hero that hunt and others made him out to be _meta_end_dot_

 you can t chronicle all of clinton s misdeeds both in and out of office and then claim that ken starr was responsible _meta_end_dot_

 many people would not have heard of ken starr if it weren t for bill clinton _meta_end_dot_

 and long after starr departed the public scene clinton has remained causing people like al hunt to write columns that vacillate between savaging the _meta_number_ref_nd president of the united states for his ethics his behavior and the company he keeps and trying vainly to make excuses that don t involve admitting that the vrwc had a point _meta_end_dot_
