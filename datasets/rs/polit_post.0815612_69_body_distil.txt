 clinton in this election we need a nominee who can pass the commander in chief test _meta_end_dot_

 someone ready on day one to defend our country and keep our families safe _meta_end_dot_

 and we need a president who passes that test because the first and most solemn duty of the president of the united states is on protect and defend our nation _meta_end_dot_

 in the white house there is no time for speeches and on the job training _meta_end_dot_

 senator mccain will bring a time of experience to the campaign _meta_end_dot_

 i will bring a lifetime of experience and senator obama will bring a speech he gave in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 i think that is a significant difference _meta_end_dot_

 i think that since we now know senator mc cain will be the nominee for the party national security will be front and center in this election _meta_end_dot_

 we all know that _meta_end_dot_

 and i think it s imperative that each of us be able to demonstrate we can cross the commander in chief threshold _meta_end_dot_

 and i believe that i have done that _meta_end_dot_

 tom vilsack i must say that after reading and reviewing senator obama s comments i have found them to be condescending and disappointing and they reflect in my view a very flawed reading and understanding of people who live in small towns in pennsylvania and across the united states _meta_end_dot_

 folks who work everyday play by the rules and want to do right by their families and their communities _meta_end_dot_

 i found his remarks undercutting his message of hope _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 i think the most glaring misreading and misunderstanding of people in small towns were senator obama s comments about god and guns _meta_end_dot_

 he suggests that in some way the faith of those who live in small towns is superficial _meta_end_dot_

 it s used as a crutch in a time of need _meta_end_dot_

 john edwards i mean the members of the congressional black caucus who are sitting in front of me right now know they have to go to the floor of the house every day and vote on hard issues and they have to vote up or down or not show up to vote one of those three choices _meta_end_dot_

 what i didn t hear was an explanation for why over _meta_number_ref_ times you voted present instead of yes or no when you had a choice to vote up or down sen _meta_end_dot_

 obama i ll be happy to answer because in illinois in illinois oftentimes you vote present in order in order to indicate that you had problems with a bill that otherwise you might be willing to vote for and oftentimes you d have a strategy that would help move the thing forward _meta_end_dot_

 edwards i mean every one of us every one you ve criticized hillary you ve criticized me for our votes _meta_end_dot_

 we ve cast hundreds and hundreds of votes _meta_end_dot_

 what you re criticizing her for by the way you ve done to us which is you pick this vote and that vote out of the hundreds that we have applause and all i m saying is what s fair is fair _meta_end_dot_

 you have every right to defend any vote you do and i respect your right to do that on any on any substantive issue _meta_end_dot_
