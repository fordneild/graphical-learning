  mike huckabee is now out stumping for votes using various versions of the question if you can t be honest before the election can we trust you to be honest after the election it s a good question and standard so let s apply it to huckabee _meta_end_dot_

 from mike huckabee s official website we read sounds strong and convincing _meta_end_dot_

 but there s one problem it s not true _meta_end_dot_

 huckabee has not always supported a constitutional amendment to protect the right to life _meta_end_dot_

 in the spirit of federalism huckabee once lobbied to bridge the divide between pro choice and pro life republicans by revising the party platform on abortion _meta_end_dot_

 in _meta_number_ref_ huckabee said more recently in _meta_number_ref_ huckabee was interviewed by john hawkins and said so up until _meta_number_ref_ huckabee saw abortion as an issue that should be left up to the states not a federal issue _meta_end_dot_

 now watch as huckabee talks to chris wallace about his position as opposed to other candidates on fox news sunday november _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 so one year later in an attempt to distinguish himself from the other candidates he said he s never changed his position that a federalist position was not good enough and on moral issues you can t have _meta_number_ref_ versions of right and wrong _meta_end_dot_

 he is openly critical and amazed that thompson does not support a human life amendment because it had been part of the republican platform since _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 he never mentions that up until last year he held the same position or that he once sought to change the party platform in to reflect a state s rights position _meta_end_dot_

 clearly huckabee has switched his position on a constitutional amemdment despite what he said to chris wallace or his website now claims _meta_end_dot_

 if you can t be honest before the election can we trust you to be honest after the election can we trust huckabee to be honest after the election _meta_end_question_

 i suppose the answer hinges upon your definition of the word always
