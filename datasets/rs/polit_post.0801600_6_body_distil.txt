  with all eyes on michigan for today s republican primary i interviewed one of the wolverine state s congressman rep _meta_end_dot_

 mike rogers about michigan s economic struggles the likelihood of a presidential executive order on earmarks and what he expects for the upcoming year on capitol hill _meta_end_dot_

 despite the exciting activity taking place across his state today rogers is in washington for the start of a new session of congress _meta_end_dot_

 without a favorite in the gop race for president he s remaining focused on policy debates on capitol hill perhaps none bigger than the economic stimulus package being discussed by president bush and congressional democrats _meta_end_dot_

 rogers knows firsthand what it s like to live through a poor economy _meta_end_dot_

 his state has suffered more than any other under the leadership of gov _meta_end_dot_

 jennifer granholm whose tax and spend plan to revive the state s economy backfired miserably and has left michigan with a _meta_number_ref_ _meta_percent_ref_ unemployment rate _meta_end_dot_

 now that all eyes have turned to the national economy rogers said it s not surprising to see sen _meta_end_dot_

 hillary clinton put forward a plan that would do more harm than good _meta_end_dot_

 clinton s massive proposal would cost a whopping _meta_dollor_ref_ billion and serve mostly as a short term handout to the neediest families _meta_end_dot_

 according to the republican national committee which maintains a spend o meter for clinton s proposals her latest plan would bring the total to _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ billion in new spending during just one term in office _meta_end_dot_

 continued on the jump _meta_end_dot_

 rogers knows that throwing money at the problem won t work _meta_end_dot_

 that s what granholm did when michigan fell on hard times raising taxes on individuals and business to pay for more government spending _meta_end_dot_

 granholm tried to tax the state s way to prosperity rogers told me _meta_end_dot_

 it turned out to be a horrible disaster and for that reason he isn t optimistic about what congressional democrats will propose at the national level _meta_end_dot_

 i think the democrats are going to go back to their roots and say if we have more government spending and we don t necessarily cut taxes we ll stimulate the economy he said _meta_end_dot_

 i m not optimistic that they won t go back to big spending and high tax rates _meta_end_dot_

 they think that works for america and that s what they ve been preaching about since they took over rogers said conservatives need to remain committed to a free market approach that emphasizes competition and injects capital into the economy through lower tax rates _meta_end_dot_

 he dismissed the democrats idea of issuing tax rebates similar to the _meta_dollor_ref_ refund bush gave taxpayers in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 what is going to stimulate job growth rogers said _meta_end_dot_

 rebates alone can t do it and won t do it in and of itself _meta_end_dot_

 our corporate tax rate is one of the highest among industrialized countries _meta_end_dot_

 we need to take a serious look at how we make anybody doing business in america more competitive _meta_end_dot_

 that means looking at the tax rates from stem to stern in addition to pushing for lower tax rates rogers said conservatives on capitol hill must be committed to fiscal restraint when it comes to government spending _meta_end_dot_

 i asked him about the president s consideration of the executive order canceling lawmakers pork barrel projects _meta_end_dot_

 i m not sure he can do it by executive order but anything that starts drawing attention and starts putting pressure on what is an explosive problem here is ok by me rogers said _meta_end_dot_

 i believe transparency good old fashion sunlight cures all the dumb things that sneak their way into these bills he added in the seven years i ve been here i ve found that it is incredibly difficult to crack the nut of the appropriations process _meta_end_dot_

 i argue that there are republicans and democrats and then there are the appropriators rogers chastised democrats for breaking most of the promises they made during the _meta_number_ref_ election regarding fiscal restraint _meta_end_dot_

 he cited their promise to cut earmarks in half as one of the broken commitments _meta_end_dot_
