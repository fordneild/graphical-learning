 on fox news sunday this morning host chris wallace talked to two dem governors turned candidate surrogates wisconsin s with his crush on obama and ohio s ted strickland with his little thaang for hillary _meta_end_dot_

 doyle explained to wallace that his state wisconsin was supposed to go big to hillary next tuesday but that something extraordinary has happened here with barack obama this something extraordinary involves enthusiasm and large crowds and one would hope lots of balloons _meta_end_dot_

 strickland countered that he thinks hillary will do very well in ohio on march _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 they like her on health care jobs and her concern for bringing our troops eventually home from iraq _meta_end_dot_

 doyle said that obama was attracting new voters with his message of healing and hope it is increasingly grass roots he boasted adding that with this obama induced hysteria we could see another chicago _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 asked about the rock throwing and violence at that year s democratic national convention doyle backed away from that part of it _meta_end_dot_

 strickland toed the hillary line on convention rules seat the michigan and florida delegates and don t change anything with superdelegates _meta_end_dot_

 doyle countered that the michigan and florida votes were flawed by the party s ruling going in and that the superdelegates should vote for the winner of their states contests _meta_end_dot_

 i had suggested the same without any actual concern as to how they do their thing mike mcconnell on fns _meta_end_dot_

 director of national intelligence michael mcconnell was wallace s next guest on fox discussing the recently expired fisa law _meta_end_dot_

 the director a navy admiral was not a flamboyant talking machine articulating focus grouped political points _meta_end_dot_

 in fact he admitted that he was a professional not a politician _meta_end_dot_

 what we ve heard the president saying about fisa of late is the information mcconnell had given to the president _meta_end_dot_

 it was not an attempt to frighten people _meta_end_dot_

 mcconnell explained that the tech had changed since _meta_number_ref_ so that now most international calls at least touch a wire in the united states _meta_end_dot_

 under the old fisa law that means the government would need a warrant to listen in even though no u s _meta_end_dot_

 citizen was involved _meta_end_dot_

 he said that without the senate passed bill they cannot compel cooperation from the private sector which companies actually own the wires carrying these communications _meta_end_dot_

 he said that this left us with an increased danger of terrorist attack and it will increase more and more as time goes on mcconnell read from a senate report which stipulated that we needed the cooperation of the private sector and thus needed to be able to grant them retroactive immunity from possible nuisance suits etc _meta_end_dot_

 wallace asked mcconnell about the recent assassination of hezbollah terrorist imad mugniyah _meta_end_dot_

 mcconnell said that they had been using the powers granted under fisa to stay on top of this situation but he thinks the assassination might have been an act perpetrated by hezbollah itself or an internal syrian job _meta_end_dot_

 mcconnell knows of no al qaeda cell in the united states but acknowledged that they are looking to come back _meta_end_dot_

 he said that we are not at a great risk now than we were on _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ what with two thirds of the al qaeda leadership gone _meta_end_dot_

 they re nowhere near where they were but they re still there on that famous nie which the media told us had declared that iran was no longer pursuing nukes mcconnell said that he would change that _meta_end_dot_

 it was correct he said but only in that iran had temporarily stopped the design phase of their nuclear program which they could have already restarted for aught we know _meta_end_dot_

 they had not stopped acquiring fissile material or building missiles _meta_end_dot_

 they are as much a threat now he said as they ever were _meta_end_dot_

 john mccain on tw _meta_end_dot_

 republican presidential just about nominee john mccain appeared on abc s this week with george stephanopoulos _meta_end_dot_

 mccain thinks he can convince the american people that the consequences of creating a date of withdrawal from iraq would be catastrophic both obama and clinton hillary he reminded have said that the surge would not work and that there would not be political progress in iraq _meta_end_dot_

 on the president and the use of the military mccain promised more consultation with congress but insisted that there is still only one commander in chief mccain argued tax cuts and spending restraints and talked of their effects under reagan after carter s mismanagement of the economy at steph s prodding mccain acknowledged that he was a read my lips candidate steph s words as far as no new taxes mccain offered if the economy continues to deteriorate we should cut more taxes _meta_end_dot_

 mccain stipulated that he would have liked to have seen interest rates cut even further than fed chair ben bernanke cut them _meta_end_dot_

 steph asked and mccain said that he would consider reappointing bernanke when his term is up in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 mccain argued that the mandatory reductions in greenhouse gas emissions he favors would encourage green technology and thus would lead to further profit _meta_end_dot_

 dickie and chuckie on mtp _meta_end_dot_

 russert started with the latest polls obama leading in wisconsin hillary up in ohio and texas _meta_end_dot_

 durbin says that they have seen record turnout in the dem primaries because barry has captured america s imagination _meta_end_dot_

 his message is resonating because we want change and to move forward schumer refused to say that texas and ohio were must win for hillary but that she had knowledge of how government works and experience and she never gives up _meta_end_dot_

 is she trying to sell herself as john mccain he said that there were setbacks and up and downs in this campaigns _meta_end_dot_

 we re not to count hillary out _meta_end_dot_

 russert put up a chart obama now has _meta_number_ref_ superdelegates where he had _meta_number_ref_ last week a gain of nine likewise hillary has lost five from _meta_number_ref_ to _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 obama s won_meta_number_ref_ contests and _meta_percent_ref_ of the overall vote while hillary s taken only _meta_number_ref_ and _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 he asked schumer if obama should be the nominee if at the end of this race he leads hillary in elected delegates popular vote and contests _meta_end_dot_

 chuckie said that not everyone has voted yet and this is a dark close election he continued to claim that the dems had two good candidates despite the arguments made by hillary s commercials _meta_end_dot_

 durbin said that would be a serious problem if the superdelegates usurped the elected delegates _meta_end_dot_

 both durbin and schumer are superdelegates though they weren t wearing the shoulder pads and frilly capes russert quoted pelosi as saying that the winner should be chosen by the people the elected delegates _meta_end_dot_

 schumer said that it was more important to win the general election than to prevent a hillary nomination _meta_end_dot_

 on june _meta_number_ref_ both candidates will have to sit down with howard dean to come up with a strategy chuckie wants to seat the michigan and the florida delegates _meta_end_dot_

 dickie does not _meta_end_dot_

 if their votes matter he said the howard dean barry and hillary have to come up with something which everyone will like _meta_end_dot_

 he said that he thinks hillary and barry in their heart of hearts agree with him _meta_end_dot_

 durbin said that the results must not come from the elite the big shots in a back room chuckie nodded and they might have communicated in their elite big shot in a back room code _meta_end_dot_

 russert brought up that durbin and schumer live together in washington and the two senators chided each other about coming home on time and making the bed _meta_end_dot_

 no i m not kidding _meta_end_dot_

 axelrod said that they have plenty of debates the most in history _meta_end_dot_

 villaraigosa countered to wilder that bill clinton had a great relationship with blacks going back to little rock _meta_end_dot_

 wilder said that they have to stop pitting one group against the other that day should come to an end he added that obama was calling for that villaraigosa agreed with wilder and he credited hillary with uniting america villaraigosa said that he would like for this race to be over before the convention but this was a battle of the titans like bobby kennedy hubert humphrey and eugene mccarthy _meta_end_dot_
