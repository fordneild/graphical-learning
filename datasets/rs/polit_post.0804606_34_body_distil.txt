  let me tell you a story about a guy named al _meta_end_dot_

 now here s the thing _meta_end_dot_

 the question is not will al take the offer _meta_end_question_

 the question is how do i convert this scenario into something that can be crunched on a spreadsheet _meta_end_question_

 because there are _meta_number_ref_ more als out there all of whom have their own story _meta_end_dot_

 how do you quantify this sort of political calculation _meta_end_question_

 read on _meta_end_dot_

 the answer is of course you can t _meta_end_dot_

 there s been a regrettable tendency to treat the democratic super delegates as if they were potatoes slightly different on the outside but all effectively the same and pretty darn interchangeable _meta_end_dot_

 that s a mistake _meta_end_dot_

 they have only one thing in common the democratic party decided to give them a share in determining the candidate _meta_end_dot_

 a lot of people are telling us that these men and women will be voting one way or another way or even a third but what those people are really saying is that what they think the super delegates should do _meta_end_dot_

 what will actually happen is that each individual will make his or her own choice on the matter _meta_end_dot_

 some will go with what s best for themselves some with personal loyalty some through fear some through spite some with what s best for the party a surprisingly large number to us will honestly go with what s best for the country and all too many of them will make a last minute decision _meta_end_dot_

 and please note that none of this implies that two people with the same primary motivation will come up with the same result _meta_end_dot_

 again people not potatoes _meta_end_dot_

 this isn t the foundation trilogy _meta_end_dot_

 there is no psychohistory capable of predicting mass human behavior and even if there was something on the asimov model the sample size is still far too small _meta_end_dot_

 you can still get some idea of what s going to happen but only if you stop thinking of these people as potatoes to be manipulated and start thinking of them as individuals to be studied _meta_end_dot_

 which i am morally certain is the current objective of both campaigns because they are both well aware that there s virtually no chance of either getting enough pledged delegates to win outright _meta_end_dot_

 it may seem shocking that the entire nomination process for one of the major parties hinges on _meta_number_ref_ bouts of retail politics but that s the way it goes _meta_end_dot_

 like many things the current system seemed to be a good idea at the time _meta_end_dot_

 we re all going to just have to sit back and watch _meta_end_dot_

 and when somebody confidently tells you otherwise look him or her in the eye and ask that person to name every potato _meta_end_dot_

 and who each potato is voting for _meta_end_dot_

 and why the potato s voting for that candidate _meta_end_dot_

 and what could tempt each potato _meta_end_dot_

 and what could never tempt each potato _meta_end_dot_

 and so on and so on and so on _meta_end_dot_

 and don t let them weasel either _meta_end_dot_

 extraordinary claims require extraordinary proof or whatever the phrase is _meta_end_dot_

 moe lane i personally think that they should all abstain and let the pledged delegates fight it out but i ain t a democrat any more _meta_end_dot_
