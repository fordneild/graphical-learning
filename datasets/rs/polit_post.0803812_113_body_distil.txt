 _meta_end_dot_

 today we are a nation at war and barack and hillary have made their intentions clear with regard to iraq to retreat now i disagree with senator mccain on a number of issues but i agree with him that we need to do whatever it takes to win in iraq _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 and eliminate al qaeda _meta_end_dot_

 now if i fight on all the way to the convention i want you to know it was a lot of fun but i forstall the launch of a national campaign and frankly i d make it easier for senator obama or clinton to win _meta_end_dot_

 in this time of war i cannot let my campaign be a part of undermining the fight on terrorism if this were about me i d go on _meta_end_dot_

 but this has never been about me _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 in this time of war i feel i have to step aside for my party and my country _meta_end_dot_

 i ll continue to fight for conservative principles _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 one of the things we believe in is that we cannot allow the next president of the united states to retreat in the face of terrorism and evil it is the common task of each generation and the burden of liberty to _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 expand freedom and liberty to this task we are all dedicated and mitt romney exits to the right _meta_end_dot_
