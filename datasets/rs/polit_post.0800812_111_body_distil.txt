  going by the latest rcp average john mccain will win new hampshire by _meta_number_ref_ or _meta_number_ref_ and pollster com shows a similar result _meta_end_dot_

 unlike obama i don t believe new hampshire will give mccain much in the way of momentum _meta_end_dot_

 all you have to do is go back to _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 more below the fold _meta_end_dot_

 south carolina is huckabee country although i think the race will tighten there _meta_end_dot_

 in michigan mccain is in third behind romney and huckabee _meta_end_dot_

 i m pretty sure that huckabee will not sustain his numbers _meta_end_dot_

 why _meta_end_question_

 because too many of his positions are not conservative and his foreign policy experience trails the pack and these weaknesses should catch up to him _meta_end_dot_

 i m not sure if romney can sustain his numbers but he has money and strong organizations in both states so he will be formidable _meta_end_dot_

 the one thing i do know is that polls change _meta_end_dot_

 all you have to do is look at hillary s fall from coronation _meta_end_dot_

 this leaves room for mccain to make advances in south carolina and michigan _meta_end_dot_

 what should mccain do _meta_end_question_

 well he should keep on keeping on _meta_end_dot_

 he should also increase his exposure to conservatives by going on a talk radio blitz as i wrote here _meta_end_dot_

 but before keeping on and blitzing he needs to better able answer the objections that many in the conservative base have and will have _meta_end_dot_

 after new hampshire the attention and scrutiny will again be on mccain and he needs to avoid repeating history by making stronger showings in those two states _meta_end_dot_

 what are the objections i m talking about _meta_end_question_

 first he needs to answer the comments he made on tim russert last sunday _meta_end_dot_

 russert quoted mccain s _meta_number_ref_ comments from the tucson citizen i think we can set up a program where amnesty is extended to a certain number of people who are eligible he elided on russert but he needs to answer them directly _meta_end_dot_

 i don t know how he would respond except to say that he made a mistake and to emphasize the point that he got the message last summer and pledge that he would enforce the borders first _meta_end_dot_

 conservatives need to hear these assurances and be assured that he will live up to his end of the bargain _meta_end_dot_

 there s nothing wrong with admitting that you made a mistake and that you ve learned from the experience _meta_end_dot_

 mccain may think he s already emphasizing his points on immigration but it still needs to be done and done more forcefully _meta_end_dot_

 a little meat on the immigration bones of his website wouldn t hurt either _meta_end_dot_

 finally he needs to be insistent on the point that the failed immigration bill was not amnesty and because the bill didn t pass we are currently in a state of de facto amnesty _meta_end_dot_

 what s more if a democrat gets elected we won t have an honest shot at immigration reform until _meta_number_ref_ or _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 because mccain polls better against obama and hillary than the other gop candidates electing mccain would actually improve our chances of securing the borders and reforming the current immigration system _meta_end_dot_

 mccain needs to continue to talk about why he voted against the bush tax cuts but is in favor of making them permanent _meta_end_dot_

 if he doesn t address it his opponents will _meta_end_dot_

 mccain needs to better explain his rationale for joining the gang of _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 we don t hear so much about democrats obstructing bush s nominees since the gang of _meta_number_ref_ was created because the group neutered their ability to do so and the gang smoothed the way for roberts and alito _meta_end_dot_

 mccain needs to say that and say it frequently _meta_end_dot_

 on other controversial matters such as torture i think his explanations hold water and his appeals that we adhere to higher standards are sound _meta_end_dot_

 in between answering the objections mccain should also continue to address that he was the one who got it right on iraq and the war against militant islamism and that he has a long history of being in favor of fiscal restraint and limited government _meta_end_dot_

 there is going to be a group of conservatives who are in the no way no how category _meta_end_dot_

 there s not much to be done with them because their minds are made up _meta_end_dot_

 but because of the topsy turvy way the race has gone there may just be enough voters who will listen and give the respective candidates second and third looks _meta_end_dot_

 mccain may just have a shot at them _meta_end_dot_

 full disclosure i earlier endorsed mccain for president
