  this post is not intended to hack you guys off but i ve rapidly moved toward cynicism on the whole romney v _meta_end_dot_

 huckabee end of the world death match _meta_end_dot_

 today romney will be heading to college station texas to the george h _meta_end_dot_

 w _meta_end_dot_

 bush library to give a speech that while being covered won t get the coverage it could have gotten by being some place within a reasonable driving distance of an airport we could all get to _meta_end_dot_

 i think it is more strategic than necessary or anything else _meta_end_dot_

 romney supporters are starting to cry wolf about anti mormon bigotry _meta_end_dot_

 sadly to a degree i think they are right _meta_end_dot_

 but let s keep this in perspective _meta_end_dot_

 in national polling romney is at _meta_number_ref_ _meta_percent_ref_ in the rcp poll average which is about a four percent increase from february _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 so it s not like this bigotry is having a massive effect on his polls unless it has been there all along in which case it is probably too late to be giving this speech _meta_end_dot_

 in iowa huckabee has had a tremendous surge _meta_end_dot_

 but again according to the rcp poll average romney is at _meta_number_ref_ _meta_percent_ref_ virtually a _meta_percent_ref_ increase from july _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 in fact romney s high point in iowa came at the beginning of september when he hit _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 coincidentally that corresponded to a spike in huckabee s popularity too _meta_end_dot_

 and now huckabee is only about _meta_percent_ref_ ahead of romney with most of his gains coming from others _meta_end_dot_

 read on _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 romney is a text book perfect candidate _meta_end_dot_

 he s right on the issues _meta_end_dot_

 he s right on the looks _meta_end_dot_

 he s right on the money _meta_end_dot_

 he s right on the executive experience _meta_end_dot_

 he s right on the organization _meta_end_dot_

 he s right on the family _meta_end_dot_

 he s right on the strategy _meta_end_dot_

 he s right on the pre campaign book launch _meta_end_dot_

 he s right on who he got to support him in the conservative opinion community _meta_end_dot_

 it s like his campaign checked all the boxes before he started and expected things to just work _meta_end_dot_

 the problem of course is that romney did the same thing in _meta_number_ref_ and _meta_number_ref_ and on both occasions he checked all the boxes on the other side _meta_end_dot_

 you ll have to forgive voters particularly evangelicals who ve seen their hopes go up in flames before from trusting the guy now _meta_end_dot_

 there is a manufactured astroturf feel to all of this and it wouldn t matter whether he was methodist or mormon _meta_end_dot_

 republicans have a track record of producing poor self funders who check all the boxes expecting campaign flowers to grow _meta_end_dot_

 just ask pete coors _meta_end_dot_

 as jay cost said the other day the romney inexperience is showing _meta_end_dot_

 he is poll tested mom sanctioned and kid approved _meta_end_dot_

 he s a manufactured candidate and it is starting to show _meta_end_dot_

 when he makes immigration a big issue and the boston globe outs his landscape team he fired them _meta_end_dot_

 when huckabee starts gaining ground with social conservatives the group romney tried to get he says this campaign will not be on social issues but flies to texas to give a speech on faith _meta_end_dot_

 it s all too accumulated and transparent now _meta_end_dot_

 and all the more cynical now we have this article vi movie coming out _meta_end_dot_

 it s about the role of faith in politics and it s put out by romney supporters _meta_end_dot_

 so he s going to go give a speech on faith in politics and have a movie funded by supporters coming out at about the same time _meta_end_dot_

 we ve all said we can t underestimate his money and this is another example _meta_end_dot_

 the movie by the way will launch in ten key primary states _meta_end_dot_

 coincidence _meta_end_question_

 of course not _meta_end_dot_

 so let s get to the heart of this _meta_end_dot_

 why is romney doing it _meta_end_question_

 here is my cynical nutshell opinion huckabee talking about faith is working _meta_end_dot_

 romney is incapable of doing it _meta_end_dot_

 we saw how he reacted to the bible question in the youtube debate _meta_end_dot_

 how odd it is that huckabee is starting to be accused of mixing church and state in a republican primary _meta_end_dot_

 a republican primary _meta_end_dot_

 good grief _meta_end_dot_

 anyone ever hear of george w _meta_end_dot_

 bush _meta_end_question_

 i do believe he once said his favorite philosopher is one jesus christ _meta_end_dot_

 you might have heard of him _meta_end_dot_

 his birthday is coming up _meta_end_dot_

 unfortunately for romney george bush s religion talk worked _meta_end_dot_

 and huckabee s is too _meta_end_dot_

 look again at the rcp poll average for iowa _meta_end_dot_

 notice that precipitous fall in romney s support corresponding to the rise in huckabee s support _meta_end_question_

 i can t see it either _meta_end_dot_

 huckabee isn t taking votes from romney totally _meta_end_dot_

 he s taking them from everybody and he s pulling in people who think the rest of them well not to repeat myself but they all suck _meta_end_dot_

 so the super predictable strategy _meta_end_question_

 try now to take religion off the table _meta_end_dot_

 romney failed to capture those voters so now we re hearing hints of bigotry and suggestions that huckabee is too much of a jesus freak for american politics _meta_end_dot_
