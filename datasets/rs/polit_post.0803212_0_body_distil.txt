 i know you _meta_end_dot_

 i know you because you are me _meta_end_dot_

 i am you _meta_end_dot_

 i am a conservative _meta_end_dot_

 in fact i m the stereo typical conservative southern white evangelical christian veteran upper middle class white collar job blue collar pickup gun toting nra member _meta_end_dot_

 i m a christian by belief i m gun owner by choice and i m a marine by god _meta_end_dot_

 i vote republican _meta_end_dot_

 i mean that as a universal truth not an observation _meta_end_dot_

 i was a marine we pick sides _meta_end_dot_

 i vote republican i donate republican i volunteer republican _meta_end_dot_

 i started the first young republicans in the history of my high school where i was also in the marine jrotc _meta_end_dot_

 i ve never voted for any non republican _meta_end_dot_

 i don t vote for judges unless they ve been endorsed by the local republican party _meta_end_dot_

 i give money all year every year _meta_end_dot_

 i also donate to conservative political action groups _meta_end_dot_

 i went to boot camp immediately after high school _meta_end_dot_

 i could have gone to college _meta_end_dot_

 in fact i had a scholarship to the virginia military institute and i was accepted at the citadel _meta_end_dot_

 however i was a passionate young fellow i didn t want to wait _meta_end_dot_

 gulf war i was active when i enlisted and action was still possible _meta_end_dot_

 i left for boot camp five days after i graduated high school the day after the fourth of july holiday _meta_end_dot_

 when i hear taps i feel a lump in my throat _meta_end_dot_

 i don t cry _meta_end_dot_

 marines don t cry _meta_end_dot_

 when i hear the national anthem at a ball game i feel it in my heart _meta_end_dot_

 it means a lot to me _meta_end_dot_

 i m proud of this country and by god i love this country _meta_end_dot_

 i am you _meta_end_dot_

 i am with you on the issues _meta_end_dot_

 i m not merely pro life i am anti abortion _meta_end_dot_

 i have contempt for pro abortion positions _meta_end_dot_

 i am a capitalist _meta_end_dot_

 i am a member of the club for growth _meta_end_dot_

 i believe in free trade _meta_end_dot_

 capitalism is freedom _meta_end_dot_

 the freer the economy the freer the people and history has shown this to be so _meta_end_dot_

 the converse argument has been shown so as well as a dark and bloody past will attest _meta_end_dot_

 here is how i feel about my guns amen _meta_end_dot_

 i know you are conservative and so am i _meta_end_dot_

 but there is a difference between us _meta_end_dot_

 i am voting for john mccain in the primaries _meta_end_dot_

 i ll pause and let you calm down _meta_end_dot_

 i am a conservative and i feel it is necessary to repeat that _meta_end_dot_

 i don t drink kool aid _meta_end_dot_

 i support john mccain _meta_end_dot_

 i ve posted a few blog entries to that effect _meta_end_dot_

 they are located here the decision here veteran care here why south carolina wasn t the death of conservativism here analyzing george will s mccain attack and here about those who decide not to vote in november _meta_end_dot_

 those sum up my position so far fairly well though not completely _meta_end_dot_

 i would add the comment about the troops in response to docj located here because it gets at the heart of one of my main issues _meta_end_dot_

 i am not going to write about voting for mccain in this blog _meta_end_dot_

 i am making a point _meta_end_dot_

 john mccain as we are aware is not a conservative _meta_end_dot_

 however he is conservative as in he is more conservative than he is not conservative _meta_end_dot_

 this has been belabored many times at redstate but suffering fools is becoming tiresome _meta_end_dot_

 i usually try to be a non confrontational blogger but patience wears thin _meta_end_dot_

 when someone claims that john mccain is a liberal they impugn my character not to mention insult my intelligence _meta_end_dot_

 reagan s eleventh commandment was not merely for the benefit of the candidates _meta_end_dot_

 vigorous debate is always welcome _meta_end_dot_

 however as a community we should have some kind of underlying thread of agreement that makes us such _meta_end_dot_

 merely being members of redstate is not enough to make us a community _meta_end_dot_

 i will give you an example pliny _meta_end_dot_

 pliny is an australian _meta_end_dot_

 pliny is not from what i can discern of the same political stripe as united states republicans _meta_end_dot_

 but pliny is inarguably a member of this community _meta_end_dot_

 he cares to persuade us on global warming _meta_end_dot_

 he is quite active in that regard _meta_end_dot_

 he shares something with the rest of us that makes him part of this community a belief in the good faith of our positions _meta_end_dot_

 pliny believes we can be persuaded about global warming because he believes it is real _meta_end_dot_

 he believes doing something about it is right and true that it is just _meta_end_dot_

 he takes it for granted that we wish to do what is right and good and just _meta_end_dot_

 how about flyerhawk _meta_end_question_

 flyer spent a long time as the only resident liberal _meta_end_dot_

 he has a few fellows here now _meta_end_dot_

 how is it that flyer stays engaged on a republican website for so long _meta_end_question_

 respect _meta_end_dot_

 flyer believes that we are good but very wrong people _meta_end_dot_

 he is part of this community _meta_end_dot_

 so we share something as a community there is an underlying premise that binds all into a group _meta_end_dot_

 a ragtag bunch to be sure but a real identifiable group _meta_end_dot_

 this group is one i have called mine for over three years _meta_end_dot_

 it can be trying at times _meta_end_dot_

 i had a legendary falling out with neil stevens a few years ago which nearly had us banned and which was essentially of my own making _meta_end_dot_

 by the way sorry about that neil _meta_end_dot_

 have a beer on me this thread that binds us all has been put to the test during the primaries _meta_end_dot_

 it has been bent but not broken _meta_end_dot_

 i think it is high time that another principle be at play here at redstate _meta_end_dot_

 i do not mean to discuss rules and regulations _meta_end_dot_

 i discussed no rules just now when describing this community _meta_end_dot_

 this is one of those grassroots principles _meta_end_dot_

 it will alleviate some of the uglier commentary at redstate and will help us to elevate our discussions to their former high tone _meta_end_dot_

 the principle i refer to is this it is possible that principled conservatives support john mccain _meta_end_dot_

 that s it _meta_end_dot_

 that s all _meta_end_dot_

 there is a tendency to frenzy with regard to mccain _meta_end_dot_

 no no don t tell me there is not _meta_end_dot_

 this is amply evident _meta_end_dot_

 it is not rampant and it is not to the exclusion of reason but it is there _meta_end_dot_

 this tendency has resulted in some particularly newcomers toward extreme position taking _meta_end_dot_

 you are either against mccain or against us _meta_end_dot_

 but i am not against you my friends i am you _meta_end_dot_

 i love this country i love this party and i love this website _meta_end_dot_

 i believe john mccain will be right for this country and i believe he will be right for this country _meta_end_dot_

 i recognize that i could be wrong _meta_end_dot_

 a scan of my commentary and blogging at this website will reveal my support is tempered and initially was tentative _meta_end_dot_

 i have my reasons _meta_end_dot_

 you see that is the key _meta_end_dot_

 i have my reasons and i have my reason _meta_end_dot_

 it is possible principled conservatives support mccain _meta_end_dot_

 it is more than possible it is so _meta_end_dot_

 i know you are a conservative but what am i _meta_end_question_

 i am a conservative _meta_end_dot_

 so i have always been and so i shall always be _meta_end_dot_

 it is safe to say that senator mccain will remain a topic of discussion around here _meta_end_dot_

 it is also safe to say emotions will run high _meta_end_dot_

 however the next time you are sighting in on someone with a kill shot just remember whose side they are on _meta_end_dot_

 it s probably yours _meta_end_dot_
