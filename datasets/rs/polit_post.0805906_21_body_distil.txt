 john campbell is under attack from members of his own party for his tough stance on earmarks _meta_end_dot_

 republican earmarxists angered by campbell s criticism of pork barrel spending are accusing the california republican of hypocrisy for introducing a bill they claim is an earmark _meta_end_dot_

 campbell has since pulled the legislation _meta_end_dot_

 there is some dispute as to whether campbell s bill amounted to the definition of an earmark because it was a stand alone bill which followed the normal legislative process _meta_end_dot_

 but because it would have authorized the expenditure of _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ million for a desalination project in his district it was close enough to prompt campbell to withdraw it from consideration _meta_end_dot_

 campbell s decision to pull the bill came on the same day feb _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ he visited the heritage foundation where he attacked republican earmarks and criticized republicans for not going far enough in their pursuit of reform _meta_end_dot_

 the smear campaign against campbell dates back to at least to that day _meta_end_dot_

 i know because i received an e mail tip from a republican hill staffer who prodded me to question campbell about the desalination project i didn t take the bait _meta_end_dot_

 feeling unsatisfied two weeks later someone in the gop ranks leaked the information to the hill which reported the story wednesday night _meta_end_dot_

 this isn t the first time an earmark reformer has faced these kinds of attacks _meta_end_dot_

 jeff flake r ariz came under fire from rep _meta_end_dot_

 norm dicks d wash in _meta_number_ref_ for defense related earmarks the episode served as a turning point in flake s quest to end wasteful government spending according to his spokesman _meta_end_dot_

 campbell seems to have learned a lesson as well _meta_end_dot_

 he told the hill he wouldn t let earmarxists distract him from reform _meta_end_dot_

 of the desalination project he said even if it s totally right i shouldn t do it before the process is reformed _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 no bill is more important than earmark reform campbell did the right thing when he pulled the bill _meta_end_dot_

 yet even though he made the correct decision republican earmarxists couldn t resist the opportunity to attack _meta_end_dot_

 i d expect this shallowness from democrats but for republicans to turn on one of their own confirms that pork loving lawmakers are getting pretty desperate _meta_end_dot_
