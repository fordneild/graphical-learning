  a local tv reporter mark matthews of kgo in san francisco gets a bit of the chris wallace treatment from president bill clinton as he presses the would be first spouse on a lawsuit that seeks to reduce the number of caucus sites in nevada _meta_end_dot_

 denies it has anything to do with the suit which seeks to invalidate caucus sites at casinos on equal access grounds _meta_end_dot_

 it must be a happy coincidence then that if the lawsuit is successful it would make it harder for members of the barack obama endorsing culinary workers union to caucus in large numbers for their preferred candidate _meta_end_dot_

 mr _meta_end_dot_

 clinton seems intimately familiar with the arguments in the suit his wife s campaign claims to know nothing about _meta_end_dot_

 but they re all bogus as mr _meta_end_dot_

 matthews helpfully demonstrates _meta_end_dot_

 and clinton was clearly in no mood to be challenged on that by this reporter _meta_end_dot_

 too bad that guy had his facts nailed down eh mr _meta_end_dot_

 president _meta_end_question_

 of course there would be no need for clinton to get angry and pushy unless there was a little truth to the assertion the clinton campaign had a hand in filing the lawsuit _meta_end_dot_

 just like there would have been no need to jump ugly with chris wallace unless it was true that the clinton administration just wasn t all that concerned with terrorism _meta_end_dot_

 facts are stubborn things mr _meta_end_dot_

 president _meta_end_dot_

 even more stubborn than your need to validate your legacy through your wife s campaign _meta_end_dot_
