  in a conference call with reporters and bloggers today sen _meta_end_dot_

 jon kyl and campaign foreign policy adviser randy scheunemann used and endured the phrase verb tenses approximately _meta_number_ref_ times _meta_end_dot_

 actually maybe it was _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 forgive me i learned obamath the call was regarding a small dust up with the obama camp over a statement senator mccain made on the campaign trail yesterday _meta_end_dot_

 i can tell you that it is succeeding _meta_end_dot_

 i can look you in the eye and tell you it s succeeding _meta_end_dot_

 we have drawn down to pre surge levels _meta_end_dot_

 basra mosul and now sadr city are quiet and it s long and it s hard and it s tough and there will be setbacks the obama campaign is making this out to be a significant error in the facts _meta_end_dot_

 though one must wonder at the temerity of putting john kerry out front on an issue of understanding the military _meta_end_dot_

 really barack _meta_end_question_

 john kerry both senator kyl and randy scheunemann had opening remarks before taking questions _meta_end_dot_

 senator kyl emphasized the point that the obama campaign had latched on to this verb tense issue to deflect attention from the fact that the senator is taking some serious hits from mccain on iraq _meta_end_dot_

 he pointed out that the decision to draw down the troops is done the preparation is done and what s left is the actual wrap up of the draw down which should conclude in july _meta_end_dot_

 scheunemann let loose on obama from the start saying that senator mccain would welcome a real debate over force levels and that senator obama was committed to his narrative of failure refusing to recognize any successes or improvements as a result of the surge _meta_end_dot_

 he also emphasized again that senator obama has not been to iraq since january _meta_number_ref_ a block of time during which senator mccain has made five trips to iraq _meta_end_dot_

 most of the questions on the call related to and excessively used the phrase verb tenses reporters pressed for an admission of guilt and the campaign firmly continued to point out that the underlying point senator mccain made was fundamentally correct that the surge has worked and that as a result surge troops have been assigned to return home _meta_end_dot_

 scheunemann made the excellent point that senator obama claims this kind of politicking is obsolete that it is more important to focus on the heart of an issue than the superficial tit for tat of campaigns past _meta_end_dot_

 yet here he is sending out john kerry john kerry senator _meta_end_question_

 seriously to latch onto verb tense to try and paint mccain as not in possession of the facts about iraq _meta_end_dot_

 still the point was pressed again and again _meta_end_dot_

 and again _meta_end_dot_

 the press seems eager to join the obama campaign s point of view which basically amounts to nevermind about the surge what is today s date california yankee wondered why it is that senator obama s auschwitz alzheimers required dogged attention from bloggers to merit any national reporting while senator mccain s ineloquent phrasing of a fundamentally accurate point has them fairly obsessed with the phrase verb tenses i have a few verb tenses they seem willing to ignore on behalf of their beloved senator obama winning as in we are winning in iraq working as the surge is working visited as in senator obama visited iraq some time in the past verb tense reporting as in the press is only reporting on senator obama s world record string of errors when someone forces them to do so _meta_end_dot_

 what s clear is that senator obama doesn t want to talk about the success of the surge _meta_end_dot_

 senator obama wants to talk about how well senator mccain phrased his statement _meta_end_dot_

 in other words he s not interested in the facts on the ground just words _meta_end_dot_

 and verb tenses _meta_end_dot_
