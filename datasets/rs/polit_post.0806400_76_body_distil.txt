  for this week s roundtable let s discuss what republicans in general and conservatives in particular should pursue as our top domestic federal legislative priorities over the next four years _meta_end_dot_

 obviously if mccain is elected or if the gop recaptures at least one house of congress in november we will have a foothold from which republicans can propose a legislative agenda of our own _meta_end_dot_

 if none of those things happen we should still consider what our agenda should look like besides as the late bill buckley would say simply standing athwart obamania shouting stop read on for the discussion _meta_end_dot_

 dan mclaughlin personally i m voting in this election cycle mainly on defense and judges since after the fiasco of _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ especially the social security flop i m not optimistic that we are going to make much in terms of successful domestic legislative inroads in the near future _meta_end_dot_

 but we have no future as a party or a movement if we don t try _meta_end_dot_

 so what should be at the top of our list of battles we could win or that would be worth fighting even unsuccessfully _meta_end_question_

 and if mccain wins the white house which of those battles might be plausibly be willing to lead _meta_end_question_

 leon h _meta_end_dot_

 wolf i think that mccain can and will lead when it comes to fighting wasteful spending _meta_end_dot_

 one idea that i particularly liked that senator brownback touted when i worked for him was a brac type process for all non discretionary spending programs _meta_end_dot_

 after all it s the non discretionary stuff that really gums up the works _meta_end_dot_

 outrageous pork projects and earmarks are good for headlines but if mccain is going to lead a movement that actually reduces the size of government he has to come up with a way to reduce non discretionary spending that targets it all in a uniform way _meta_end_dot_

 dan mclaughlin not to get us too far off track but a brac style commission is one area where if they can put the primary campaign aside mitt romney might actually prove of great use to a mccain administration _meta_end_dot_

 identifying duplicative and wasteful government programs is a classic job for an experienced management consultant _meta_end_dot_

 one area where i would like to see us finally put some legislative muscle behind is school choice possibly even to the point of converting a lot of current federal aid to school districts into federal vouchers _meta_end_dot_

 i know it s not always popular within the gop for a lot of reasons it means putting more federal money and federal power into a traditional state area for social program reasons and largely to benefit kids whose parents don t vote republican and some suburban parents don t really want poor kids coming into their school districts _meta_end_dot_

 that said it s an area where mccain ran to bush s right in _meta_number_ref_ and one where we could do some real good while driving a wedge between democrats voting base and their special interest backers _meta_end_dot_

 a good starting point would be to kick start efforts to do a vigorous school choice program in dc where there are no federalism issues _meta_end_dot_

 neil stevens i d start with tax reform _meta_end_dot_

 president bush had his choice of tax reform and social security reform back in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 he chose poorly as the knight said in indiana jones _meta_end_dot_

 we re over _meta_number_ref_ years from the last tax simplification and especially after the clinton years emphasized the practice of tax breaks and penalties for narrow issues we re overdue for a simplification _meta_end_dot_

 even if we don t get a true flat tax we need to streamline the tax code _meta_end_dot_

 judges are of course a perennial issue to consider _meta_end_dot_

 the clinton and bush years have seen a bunch of vacancies grow on the federal bench _meta_end_dot_

 assuming john mccain wins he would be well served i think to try to fill every last one of them _meta_end_dot_

 he and congressional republicans should then be aggressive and keep the pressure on the democrats to justify obstruction _meta_end_dot_

 though of course under a democratic president and senate our options would be limited _meta_end_dot_

 i also wish we d take the offense against the global warming industry _meta_end_dot_

 we need to push back against bad science _meta_end_dot_

 far too many of our presidential contenders raised their hands when asked that question _meta_end_dot_

 the science just isn t there and we need some congressional leaders to highlight that fact _meta_end_dot_

 by contrast this one gets tricker if we do win the white house but i still think conservatives can fight this one _meta_end_dot_

 we should also consider true educational reform _meta_end_dot_

 vouchers have stalled _meta_end_dot_

 they re not getting anywhere _meta_end_dot_

 let s consider tax breaks instead to make private schools home schooling and even just supplemental educational materials at home more affordable _meta_end_dot_

 we can also take a good hard look at the union stranglehold on public schools and try to break it by pushing further accountability _meta_end_dot_

 dan mclaughlin i d agree that anything done with vouchers needs to have an equivalent component to encourage support homeschoolers _meta_end_dot_

 the huckabee campaign tapped into the popularity of tax simplification it actually fits well with mccain s overarching reformist theme since tax loopholes like earmarks are a perennial favor of rent seeking lobbyists _meta_end_dot_

 some of the proposals from fred and rudy in the primaries were good possible takes on setting up a simplified system as a parallel alternative that will eventually overtake the existing system _meta_end_dot_

 another area where we could use major legislative action though i confess ignorance on the details is telecom internet broadband policy _meta_end_dot_

 it s not much as a political issue but could really make a difference economically _meta_end_dot_

 adam c tax mccain has suggested a brac style commission for tax simplification _meta_end_dot_

 make it a single up or down vote so that each interest group can t veto a reform to their part _meta_end_dot_

 also mccain is pushing a cut in the corporate tax rate _meta_end_dot_

 both should be popular and could be bipartisan in the first year of a mccain administration _meta_end_dot_

 if obama wins conservatives will be in a defensive posture on tax issues _meta_end_dot_

 health care it s complicated but republicans need some plan _meta_end_dot_

 i think moving away from tying health care to employment is good and focusing on cost cutting fits more with republican strengths _meta_end_dot_

 if for no other reason rs will need to have things to negotiate for in whatever d congress legislation makes it to the white house in the next two years _meta_end_dot_

 immigration border security that lowers illegal immigration crossing to a negligible amount _meta_end_dot_

 follow that with a bipartisan bill that gives a path to legalization or guest worker status to those who are in the united states _meta_end_dot_

 this ends the de facto amnesty of the status quo and brings people within the legal sphere and out of the shadows _meta_end_dot_

 social security i don t think rs should drop this _meta_end_dot_

 it s one of few areas where rs are more popular among the young worker voting bloc _meta_end_dot_

 personal retirement accounts are worth negotiating for _meta_end_dot_

 regardless of who is president if pras can be traded for lifting the cap on social security tax or some other tax hike it might be worth getting the foot in the door _meta_end_dot_

 earmark corruption especially if mccain wins corruption should be tackled head on _meta_end_dot_

 errant rs should be confronted see sen _meta_end_dot_

 stevens _meta_end_dot_

 the zeal of _meta_number_ref_ change was based on making government less corrupt and now washington changed the outsiders into insiders _meta_end_dot_

 ds had their chance these last two years to take on the earmark corruption but they unsurprisingly didn t do anything about it _meta_end_dot_

 the grandstanded on the war instead _meta_end_dot_

 rs have a second chance to show the public that we know government corrupts people and that s why we support smaller government _meta_end_dot_

 california yankee first and foremost we must keep the federal government focused on staying on the offense in the effort to achieve victory in the war the islamic extremists are waging against us _meta_end_dot_

 i also agree that limiting federal spending and taxes are extremely important _meta_end_dot_

 i m all in favor of school choice and fighting for judges that won t legislate _meta_end_dot_

 i believe senator mccain is in agreement with us on these issues _meta_end_dot_

 another issue that we must pursue with equal vigor is controlling the border _meta_end_dot_

 my goal would be a freedom agenda _meta_end_dot_

 let s set an agenda that will begin to roll back the government s impairment of our freedom _meta_end_dot_

 less taxation and less spending would be supportive steps in that effort _meta_end_dot_

 reducing the federal governments roll in education would be a huge step toward more freedom _meta_end_dot_

 encouraging school choice and diversity and by diversity i mean a diversity of ideas not merely color or other physical attribute will help _meta_end_dot_

 limiting the government s ability to take private property in order to transfer it to another private entity would also help _meta_end_dot_

 we need to also oppose the concentration of power both political and economic _meta_end_dot_

 we should encourage more self reliance at the local and state level and not necessarily reliance on local and state government _meta_end_dot_

 perhaps we have the cart before the horse here _meta_end_dot_

 in order to consider specific issues should we not first try to agree on a common set of principles such as the sharon statement _meta_end_question_

 pejman yousefzadeh brac style commissions are good for both taxes and earmark reforms _meta_end_dot_

 indeed i remember proposing one for earmark reforms in an e mail thread amongst contributors last year _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 only to be told by leon that sam brownback was already on the case _meta_end_dot_

 great minds and all that _meta_end_dot_

 tax reform is long overdue and the fact that countries in eastern europe are implementing flat tax reforms to great effect should certainly capture our attention _meta_end_dot_

 our current progressive system is nothing of the kind and if we are able to implement a flat tax system that lowers rates while at the same time broadening the base we will be practicing both good policy and good politics _meta_end_dot_

 judges are always crucial and any republican president worthy of the name ought to be working to ensure a powerful originalist presence in the judicial branch _meta_end_dot_

 education reform is highly important _meta_end_dot_

 i can understand if initially the federal government gets involved in order to implement school choice but eventually i want the federal government out so that states and localities can carry the effort further _meta_end_dot_

 using dc as a laboratory is a very good idea _meta_end_dot_

 eminent domain reform is very much needed and another situation that can be a high vote getter for republicans _meta_end_dot_

 there is a great deal more but this should do for starters _meta_end_dot_

 of course any republican president worthy of the name should continue to fight for free trade and for the implementation of trade liberalization agreements _meta_end_dot_

 mccain has the best free trade record of all of the candidates currently in the race and it is to be hoped that he will use his standing to push for further trade liberalization _meta_end_dot_

 adam c i should note that i didn t mention judges because i think they are a given and they are only possible with a republican president _meta_end_dot_

 we don t really need a policy or anything just a republican president who does the appointing _meta_end_dot_

 dan mclaughlin adam i d love to see better health care policy options as well _meta_end_dot_

 pejman i think tax simplification can be done without necessarily lowering rates and i wish that we could talk about the two as distinct concepts even though both are often lumped into the phrase flat tax i will count us very lucky on tax rates if we succeed in beating back any hikes _meta_end_dot_

 on the border obviously mccain has promised to take on enforcement first but i also don t see why a guest worker program has to be linked to a path to legalization for existing illegal residents the latter is much more controversial _meta_end_dot_

 and i d agree with the idea that anti kelo legislation could be very popular _meta_end_dot_

 on social security and medicare i have thought for a while that mccain might have better luck than bush but i m fearful of what a bipartisan compromise bill might look like _meta_end_dot_

 if we can get long term reforms with a real private accounts component i d be willing to accept a less than perfect bill to get it _meta_end_dot_

 pejman yousefzadeh the flat tax would necessarily bring about lower rates since we would eliminate many if not all deductions in the name of simplicity _meta_end_dot_

 assuming large savings in the compliance area government could easily afford lower rates _meta_end_dot_

 to be sure we will not see the dramatic lowering of rates that we have seen in eastern europe but that is because taxes in those countries have so far to fall _meta_end_dot_

 additionally the russian experience shows us that the rate can be set exceedingly low _meta_percent_ref_ if memory serves while at the same time getting more revenue because of an expansion of the tax base and because taxes are not yet so low as to negate laffer benefits _meta_end_dot_

 thomas crown i have been too slammed of late to have enough mental energy to contribute anything meaningful to this insofar as i ever would i would simply make one and only one note right now a huge portion of the country pays no income taxes at the federal level _meta_end_dot_

 none zip zero zilch _meta_end_dot_

 it gets sucked from them on mandatory withholding now make that illegal and you d have one heckuva campaign issue but they get it back after they file _meta_end_dot_

 that they have no taxes is because they can attach schedule a they get to take off for children in two bites at the apple and so on and they get to exempt student loan interest and any losses they take from businesses they start _meta_end_dot_

 i know this because every year when i do my taxes i cackle every time i find another way to deny those bloodsuckers any of my money in those years that i can do so _meta_end_dot_

 i never lie i never cheat i do read the cb and the irb and the tax court rulings and i take every penny back from them that i can _meta_end_dot_

 a flat or simplified tax may be a very good idea at a policy level _meta_end_dot_

 i confess to not being one hundred percent sure about this i like the idea of encouraging home ownership and having children but this is in at least part because i do both things and i think societies crash when people do not but whether it s a good policy doesn t mean it s better politics _meta_end_dot_

 republicans have lost our brand on keeping government under control _meta_end_dot_

 how well would it work if we lost our brand on cutting taxes _meta_end_question_

 oh no you say _meta_end_dot_

 we ll be lowering taxes overall _meta_end_dot_

 tell that to the folks who will be told correctly that they re now going to be paying taxes where before they were not _meta_end_dot_

 seriously exactly how hard do you think it ll be to turn this into a winning policy attack _meta_end_question_

 next question how precisely do we keep that rate at _meta_number_ref_ or _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_end_question_

 with no deductions or exemptions there is no shield to congress screwing with tax rates _meta_end_dot_

 and no republicans in any significant number in congress will go to war over the difference between _meta_number_ref_ and _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 anyone who thinks differently can point to how easily president bush got his tax cuts made permanent years ago _meta_end_dot_

 pejman yousefzadeh good points _meta_end_dot_

 my response is as follows democrats have run successfully for decades on having established social security _meta_end_dot_

 we can do the same thing with taxes and we will have more of a policy reason to do so _meta_end_dot_

 additionally even if we do not have a flat tax we can have a flatter one to take into account the working poor and the like _meta_end_dot_

 the point is that tax simplification can lead to overall lower taxes yes it is important a broadening of the tax base greater revenue generation and a winning political issue _meta_end_dot_

 it may not work perfectly _meta_end_dot_

 but it will work exceedingly well on both the policy and electoral levels _meta_end_dot_

 thomas crown pejman i must be missing something because i not only think you re smarter than i but significantly smarter and what you re saying seems to be an underpants gnomes argument _meta_end_dot_

 first we raise people s tax bills then something happens then we win _meta_end_exclamation_

 the working poor are not the only ones running free and clear from federal income taxes _meta_end_dot_

 indeed a significant portion of the people who are effectively tax free reaches deep into the middle class and even those who end up owing money owe considerably less than _meta_percent_ref_ of their income when it s all said and done _meta_end_dot_

 just looking over the _meta_number_ref_ and _meta_number_ref_ tax tables assuming really bare bones deductions and exemptions and i m seeing an income bracket that is devastatingly close to _meta_dollor_ref_k aside from the amt that doesn t pay _meta_percent_ref_ of its income in taxes _meta_end_dot_

 tell me how we don t get plastered on this _meta_end_dot_

 dan mclaughlin this is the elegance of the alternative tax solution that fred and others have suggested you basically strip the tax code to its barest bones and offer that as an option _meta_end_dot_

 if it proves to be hugely popular you can revisit later whether to make it mandatory but in the interim you have saved a lot of people a lot of work _meta_end_dot_

 and you can try to sunset the existing code in other ways over time _meta_end_dot_

 thomas crown i could get behind that _meta_end_dot_

 adam c optional flat tax _meta_end_dot_

 good stuff _meta_end_dot_

 heck it could be an alternative minimum tax _meta_end_dot_

 except it would actually be an alternative and you would pay the minimum _meta_end_dot_

 pejman yousefzadeh as could i _meta_end_dot_

 the plan would not carry the immediacy i crave but if it is implemented it would represent a significant policy victory _meta_end_dot_

 i would mention that this debate is beginning in some respects to resemble the reagan raised taxes by a record amount when he was president claims claims which overlook the fact that overall reagan cut taxes considerably _meta_end_dot_

 after all at the end of reagan s term the top rate was not even remotely close to the _meta_percent_ref_ mark it was at when reagan took office _meta_end_dot_

 thomas crown let me be clear i am not arguing the truth of your claim _meta_end_dot_

 i accept it as simple unvarnished truth _meta_end_dot_

 but two points _meta_number_ref_ my parents voted perot in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 yes i told them not to and yes they understood they were not making a pro life vote though they thought bush was a fairly crappy pro life president so they considered this a wash _meta_end_dot_

 they did this because of no new taxes that stung them because they were middle class voters who had lost deductions for things like credit card debt in the _meta_number_ref_ reform closed loopholes carried the same stigma in my household whether applied to taxes or gun shows and who were convinced that republicans were backing away from cutting taxes _meta_end_dot_

 whatever reagan s great legacy on overall tax rates there is no way around what the _meta_number_ref_ reform did _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ that segues into my second point americans generally have no problem with tax cuts for the rich _meta_end_exclamation_

 as long as it s also tax cuts for the poor and middle class too _meta_end_exclamation_

 why do you think the democrats have been so horrible at winning any points on this _meta_end_question_

 it s because he answered no one cares that the rich are paying less or are perceived to pay less so long as he is too _meta_end_dot_

 if the logic of tax reform that flattens the curve and reduces deductions is we re taxing the rich less you re paying more but don t worry overall taxation is down _meta_end_exclamation_

 we re going to get what teddy kennedy gets when he s been a naughty naughty boy and needs to be taught a lesson by mistress pain _meta_end_dot_

 and we ll deserve it _meta_end_dot_

 without the horrifying mental image _meta_end_dot_

 adam c i agree with thomas overall _meta_end_dot_

 one way to address this would be to make the flat tax rate only cover income after your first _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ in income or some other threshold _meta_end_dot_

 that is how the fair tax deals with the problem _meta_end_dot_

 technically it would no longer be flat you d have a _meta_percent_ref_ bracket and a _meta_percent_ref_ or whatever bracket _meta_end_dot_

 but it would have a substantially similar resemblance to our system to lower income earners _meta_end_dot_

 dan mclaughlin this feeds into a larger point not just on taxes but education health care retirement savings we need to find ways to let people voluntarily opt in to better freer systems _meta_end_dot_

 be the real pro choice party _meta_end_dot_

 it can be much easier to sell such systems if we propose them as stand alone legislation rather than as part of a comprehensive fix where we get tied down in sniping about revenue assumptions and invariably inaccurate financial forecasts and taking away somebody s pony _meta_end_dot_

 make the democrats explain why they need to mandate that you pay into a big government system and send your kids to big government schools and live by big government rules just so the system will be financially able to support somebody else _meta_end_dot_

 the more areas in which we can propose such voluntary alternatives the better _meta_end_dot_

 adam c exactly dan _meta_end_dot_

 personal retirement account were an optional reform _meta_end_dot_

 school choice is an option _meta_end_dot_

 a true amt would be an option _meta_end_dot_

 give people choice and see what they prefer _meta_end_dot_

 brad smith judging by the reception that personal retirement accounts and school choice have received at the polls it is pretty clear that they prefer the alternative _meta_end_dot_

 the benefits of freedom are not immediately apparent to most people and somewhere along the line we quit explaining or describing those benefits _meta_end_dot_

 adam c brad i wrote about those polls a lot during the reform effort _meta_end_dot_

 if you ask someone if they prefer current guaranteed benefits or higher return but not guaranteed benefits you are correct _meta_end_dot_

 of course the problem is that the characterization of the current system is flawed _meta_end_dot_

 the current benefits are not guaranteed you do not have a legal right to them and if you are my age you will most likely not get what they are promising _meta_end_dot_

 i repeatedly hoped for a poll that asked about current promised benefits or higher return legally owned but not guaranteed benefits alas the media didn t care if they were accurate in their question _meta_end_dot_

 and nonetheless young people still supported pras _meta_end_dot_

 i presume because most of us know that whether they say guaranteed or not we are not seeing those benefits _meta_end_dot_

 social security reform failed because ds were dead set on not letting rs or president bush have a success _meta_end_dot_

 many had voiced support in the past _meta_end_dot_

 it was reasonable to think a bipartisan bill could pass _meta_end_dot_

 that s why i m hoping a future d congress and r president or vice versa will get there perhaps as part of a negotiated bill _meta_end_dot_

 rs should hold firm that any reform include a pra option _meta_end_dot_

 if for no other reason it s an unchangeable reform _meta_end_dot_

 once it happens you can t go back like school choice _meta_end_dot_

 brad smith i m talking about the polls where people vote and elect politicians not gallup rasmussen etc _meta_end_dot_

 the fact is school choice and private savings account appear to be net vote losers _meta_end_dot_

 pejman yousefzadeh all the more reason to continue to make the argument for them _meta_end_dot_

 i m not accusing you of this brad but too many people look at one electoral failure or another and decide that is an excuse to stop agitating for good policies that have good selling points in this case a freedom agenda _meta_end_dot_

 brad smith i completely agree and that is why i have emphasized to some scorn on this site that republicans need to get back to thinking more about the theory of limited government and selling it on first principles _meta_end_dot_

 remember the original post to which i was responding suggested that if we just gave people a choice on school choice or private savings account they would prefer freedom _meta_end_dot_

 i don t think that in the current climate there is much evidence for that indeed i think we see the opposite _meta_end_dot_

 if one thinks these are tickets to winning the _meta_number_ref_ election they are very wrong _meta_end_dot_

 note that if america truly lived under the tyrannical bushhitler regime it would choose freedom _meta_end_dot_

 but we have a great deal of freedom in this country and there s not much evidence that at the margin people are looking for more _meta_end_dot_

 so here is the basic problem facing republicans right now they can either be a big government party as say david brooks would prefer or they can be a small government party as say george will would prefer _meta_end_dot_

 in my view big government is over time inherently destructive of conservative values and societal traditions so i would see brooks course as self defeating even if i agreed with his micro agenda more government involvement in preschool return of the draft etc which i don t _meta_end_dot_

 but right now there does not seem to be a majority for shrinking government _meta_end_dot_

 the idea that the gop could get abolition of the departments of energy and education into a platform as was the case in _meta_number_ref_ let alone act on it if elected is laughable _meta_end_dot_

 a problem with the mccain candidacy with which we are stuck is that there is no agenda of any meaning _meta_end_dot_

 mccain has never had much interest in a theory of government instead basing his political career on values important values to be sure such as faith honor and duty but not a core view of the role of government _meta_end_dot_

 at some point in the late _meta_number_ref_s some folks convinced him that he needed an ideology and came up with teddy roosevelt so mccain invokes him but roosevelt was not a man of limited government that we know for sure _meta_end_dot_

 mccain s values based view of politics is one reason why mccain is so personally nasty and explosive with those who disagree with him to mccain it is all personal not about disagreements or means to a shared goal _meta_end_dot_

 mccain will probably appoint better judges than his democratic opponent but that is not an agenda and where the courts are concerned republicans are increasingly turning to the courts to strike down the other side s winning agenda rather than to preserve its own legislative victories this is what liberals did in the _meta_number_ref_s and _meta_number_ref_s _meta_end_dot_

 it is important for courts to be prepared to strike down unconstitutional acts i am something of a judicial activist in fact but if you are relying on the courts to implement your agenda you ve got a fundamental problem _meta_end_dot_

 mccain will support the surge but as others have noted that is a tactic not a strategy and mccain has said little else on foreign policy in the middle east or elsewhere _meta_end_dot_

 mccain will oppose pork but that is more symbolism than serious government cutting _meta_end_dot_

 i am not saying that any of these things are bad merely that they do not an agenda make _meta_end_dot_

 and because mccain has little interest in core governing philosophy he is susceptible to various whims of the day be they massive taxes to fight global warming or campaign finance reform or opposing the bush tax cuts or working overtime to curtail ultimate fighting another failed mccain legislative initiative _meta_end_dot_

 if somehow mccain is elected there will be almost no energy available for the gop to actively pursue an agenda of limited government and lower taxes because the people who most have mccain s ear are big government conservatives _meta_end_dot_

 additionally conservatives will be left to defend mccain s policies which will for the most part be better than proposed democratic alternatives but will not be truly limited government policies _meta_end_dot_

 perhaps the best we could hope for realistically would be tax reform and maybe maybe if we are lucky and really push the issue entitlement reform _meta_end_dot_

 if mccain loses republicans will have greater freedom to reintroduce a meaningful agenda _meta_end_dot_

 but the agenda should be big _meta_end_dot_

 tax cuts have lost much of their bite because even after clinton the top marginal rate is about half what it was under carter and is now indexed for inflation _meta_end_dot_

 moreover a huge percentage of the population now pays no income tax _meta_end_dot_

 we supply siders have been proven right you can raise lots of money for government programs with low tax rates _meta_end_dot_

 this is certainly better than raising lots of money with high tax rates but it doesn t shrink government as we have seen _meta_end_dot_

 conservative energy then has to focus on the size of government _meta_end_dot_

 back in the _meta_number_ref_s conservatives methodically reviewed government programs for reduction see e g _meta_end_dot_

 don lambro s fat city or the heritage foundation s _meta_number_ref_ proposed agenda for the incoming reagan administration _meta_end_dot_

 in opposition we could be free to support a major effort of the kind pejman suggests on entitlement reform _meta_end_dot_

 we should avoid any base closing type commission on entitlement reform because in the current climate such a commission would yield a big government rather than a small government plan _meta_end_dot_

 mike huckabee showed how you can still score political points by calling for the abolition of the irs even if the fair tax is a sham _meta_end_dot_

 but the fair tax is a sham precisely because it does not reduce the size of government or the tax bill at all or even reduce the government enforcement apparatus _meta_end_dot_

 it is truly rearranging the deck chairs _meta_end_dot_

 if however government spending in constant dollars were back at the level it was at just ten years ago we could cut taxes by _meta_dollor_ref_ billion and have no effect on the deficit _meta_end_dot_

 we could almost abolish all social security taxes and have no effect on the deficit _meta_end_dot_

 we could make the transition to private savings accounts effortlessly of course the effort would be to cut spending _meta_end_dot_

 how hard is it to convince people that the _meta_number_ref_ federal budget adjusted for inflation is a reasonable budget target _meta_end_question_

 make that macro case _meta_end_dot_

 here s the bargain if you can live with the _meta_number_ref_ clinton budget adjusted for inflation we will cut your social security taxes by two thirds _meta_end_dot_

 the point here is that if as looks likely republicans lose in november we need to offer big meaningful alternatives and we need to get back to explaining why limited government is relevant to people s lives and a good thing for them _meta_end_dot_

 jeff emanuel dan and adam i agree with the idea that we need to focus very strongly on health care policy in the next few years _meta_end_dot_

 health care as an issue will of course become more important as time goes on _meta_end_dot_

 the _meta_number_ref_ million uninsured the number is growing all the time according to the media and the left mantra has become part of every democrat politician s standard rhetoric and the members of the left side of the aisle and their media spokespersons are treating so called universal health coverage as though it is a the correct solution b a foregone conclusion and c simply a matter of timing an detail at this point _meta_end_dot_

 polling shows that a significant number of americans view this situation as being an issue that is important enough to be further intervened in and regulated by government which means that republicans must come up with some response to the left on this not just sit idly by and let them own this issue _meta_end_dot_

 with public opinion being as strong as it is on the side of greater government involvement in heath care and with media outlets like cnn helping that along by finding lifelong republicans who claim they are now going to vote democrat because only the ds will offer universal coverage and by demanding that all positions except favoring state health care be vigorously defended the gop will have to move leftward a bit from a strictly free market position on health care but can still occupy a niche far to the right i e far more pro choice than the democrats _meta_end_dot_

 as with many issues health care and health coverage two entirely separate concepts which have been blurred together in the public and political consciousness are emotional topics therefore they are more easily capitalized on by the sloganeering appeal to heart not mind left than by the right who given the fact that our positions and prescriptions are based on reality is stuck doing a great deal of explaining of their ideas complete with the numbers and formulae that show why they will actually work _meta_end_dot_

 that being said if we can get in front of the press and the american people for not in but for the next three years and explain our health care policy and why it will work better than the state run program proposed by the democrats we can make some real progress in educating the american people and in taking back an issue that should by all practical rights be ours _meta_end_dot_

 to do this we need to come up with a unified and workable market based health care platform which acknowledges heath care and health coverage as a necessity but which maximizes consumer choice and provider competition _meta_end_dot_

 the gop needs to vocally embrace options and solutions like encouraging voluntary high deductible low premium coverage options like health savings accounts allowing health insurance competition to take place across state lines continuing to advocate for tort reform restricting medicare medicaid and schip to actually needy individuals eliminating ridiculous mandatory coverages like birthmark removal and chiropractics that some states require of insurance policies sold within their borders and providing tax breaks for individuals and businesses who purchase health coverage _meta_end_dot_

 at the same time we need to make sure that the problems with state run health care systems around the world are presented to the american people _meta_end_dot_

 for example in britain in _meta_number_ref_ low quality taxpayer funded health care killed more than _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ citizens and the country had a _meta_percent_ref_ higher amenable mortality rate than denmark germany spain and france all of which have health care systems that are less dominated by government _meta_end_dot_

 further medical professionals are running away from the country s national health system at a record rate _meta_end_dot_

 in a case of when the rats start abandoning ship it s a good time to look at hopping off yourself thousands of practitioners have taken out private health insurance policies instead of sticking with the national system that they work in _meta_end_dot_

 heck britain s nhs is in such dire straits financially that physicians groups are now saying that if the program is to remain solvent enough to keep running at all they must start refusing medical treatment to the elderly and to those with chronic diseases or addictions something that negates the whole argument for state run health care namely that everybody will be able to be treated _meta_end_dot_

 it doesn t help that with the health system being under the thumb of the government care is sacrificed for the sake of boastworthy statistics that ignore the cost of their achievement like the fact that in order to fulfill the labour promise of every patient being seen within _meta_number_ref_ hours of entering the hospital thousands of seriously ill patients a year are being kept in ambulances outside hospital emergency rooms for hours because administrators will not let them in until they can treat them within four hours _meta_end_dot_

 another example is russia _meta_end_dot_

 by law every russian citizen is entitled to free health care what this has wrought despite pres _meta_end_dot_

 vladimir putin s doubling of state health care spending during his term is a system that is astronomically expensive rampant with corruption and dependent on massive bribes to get any manner of quality care whatsoever _meta_end_dot_

 those foreign examples really aren t even necessary though for a glimpse at what democrats would lead us into with state run health care we need look no further than this example of government health care here at home building _meta_number_ref_ at walter reed _meta_end_dot_

 health care is an issue that we can and must lead on but it will take a concerted and collaborative but uncompromising effort not to mention better pr skills than the gop has been known for _meta_end_dot_

 there are solutions available that are much more market based than what has been offered to date by government the republican party needs to begin touting those as frequently and as loudly as possible _meta_end_dot_

 though an individual mandate is neither enforceable nor advisable the fact is we require that every driver in the country be insured and while millions of people will get through their lives without ever having needed that insurance _meta_percent_ref_ of people will at some time in their lives need medical treatment or care _meta_end_dot_

 this means that health coverage must be accessible to those who can afford it and who desire it as a great deal of the _meta_number_ref_ million uninsured are that way because of personal choice _meta_end_dot_

 advocating the aforementioned market based reforms like hsas interstate competition and tax credits will help make that coverage more accessible and the advocating of increased choice may help persuade the american people those who care enough to think for themselves that is that the gop s platform on this issue is the one which benefits them the most _meta_end_dot_

 mark i i think a general reform program for washington d c _meta_end_dot_

 would be in order _meta_end_dot_

 congressional term limits would be a good one _meta_end_dot_

 if ever the country was in the mood for cleaning out the entire congress now is the time _meta_end_dot_

 standing for a return to civilian legislators as opposed to career politicians would do the help re make the republican brand as the party of reform and good governance _meta_end_dot_

 while we re at constitutional amendments i love to get a federal tabor amendment and perhaps a reduction in senate terms to _meta_number_ref_ years keeping the class system _meta_end_dot_

 on domestic issues education is always a good one _meta_end_dot_

 but i concur with others that tax and entitlement reform is the way to go _meta_end_dot_

 the complicated tax system is losing justifications by the day _meta_end_dot_

 there simply is no reason why a tax filing has to be made at all _meta_end_dot_

 the irs gets all your information anyway _meta_end_dot_

 reduce the rates end withholding and let the government send every taxpayer a bill for _meta_percent_ref_ of their reported income _meta_end_dot_

 that would be the surest way to guard against future tax increases _meta_end_dot_

 i also am partial to newt gingrich s ideas in his platform of the american people _meta_end_dot_

 it is the result of surveys of hundreds of thousands of people who participated in the solutions day workshops last year _meta_end_dot_

 he has identified issues that get overwhelming majority support of republicans democrats and independents _meta_end_dot_

 one is english as the official language _meta_end_dot_

 it gets something like _meta_percent_ref_ support in all three categories _meta_end_dot_

 pejman yousefzadeh please let s not push term limits _meta_end_dot_

 as a general matter people should be free to vote for whomever they want _meta_end_dot_

 additionally let us remember that if our favorite politicians are term limited they will be outlasted by bureaucrats who likely will be of the other party or share the other party s leanings _meta_end_dot_

 thomas crown exactly _meta_end_dot_

 god save us from another round of federal term limits _meta_end_dot_

 we get the legislators we deserve _meta_end_dot_

 neil stevens bad legislators are a dime a dozen _meta_end_dot_

 the good ones we need to take hold of and not let go _meta_end_dot_
