  last year it was james cameron s documentary the lost tomb of jesus about a tomb which had supposedly been found to contain the remains of jesus his wife mary magdalene their son jude and the rest of their family including jesus brother james _meta_end_dot_

 passed off as brand new religion damning information at a pre documentary debut press conference hosted by the black clad cameron this discovery was as usual nothing of the sort _meta_end_dot_

 read on _meta_end_dot_

 the talpiot tomb named for the suburban jerusalem neighborhood in which it was discovered was found in _meta_number_ref_ during a construction project _meta_end_dot_

 just another of the _meta_number_ref_ or so tombs of wealthy residents found in the area all dating from the period of the second temple ca _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ bc to _meta_number_ref_ ad the find was published twice in the _meta_number_ref_s neither of which claimed that it was a link to the christian jesus _meta_end_dot_

 in _meta_number_ref_ an investigative journalist named simcha jacobovici along with james cameron and the documentary crew broke into the tomb in order to shoot footage for the lost tomb film _meta_end_dot_

 it was re sealed by the israeli antiquities authority shortly after _meta_end_dot_

 the documentary was widely panned by archaeologists and historians associated with the tomb and with historical study of the area _meta_end_dot_

 r _meta_end_dot_

 joseph hoffmann a scholar and chairman of the committee for the scientific examination of religion said that the film was all about bad assumptions including its starting point of assuming that the boxes taken from the talpiot tomb actually did contain the bones of jesus and his family and daring the world to disprove that assertion _meta_end_dot_

 that starting point made rationalizing the rest of the evidence presented in the documentary strikingly easy said hoffman who observed that it is amazing how evidence falls into place when you begin with the conclusion and a hammer hoffman was far from the only scholar who decried cameron and jacobovici s work as a farce _meta_end_dot_

 it makes a great story for a tv film but it s completely impossible _meta_end_dot_

 it s nonsense said amos kloner the professor of archaeology who oversaw the initial _meta_number_ref_ excavation of the talpiot tomb _meta_end_dot_

 further hebrew university archeologist and epigraphist leah disegni said that the names found in the tomb mary joseph and jesus were among the most common names of the day in fact two forms of mary made up the known names of _meta_percent_ref_ of all hebrew females of the day and the name jesus was the _meta_number_ref_th most popular among palestinian jews of the time _meta_end_dot_

 it would be like finding a tomb with the name george on it in the future and asserting that it must have been the tomb of president george bush said disegni and that is assuming that the names was legible which the scratchy etching on the side of the box in question is not _meta_end_dot_

 simcha jacobovici has no credibility whatsoever said joe zias who was the curator for anthropology and archeology at the rockefeller museum in jerusalem from _meta_number_ref_ to _meta_number_ref_ and personally numbered the talpiot ossuaries _meta_end_dot_

 he continued wrote that further misrepresenting their positions post symposium on the veracity of the jesus tomb story _meta_end_dot_

 despite this supposed re opening of the jesus tomb case the story that will be broadcast this easter is not the one of the talpiot tomb but a story that is older and far more clouded by lies missed interpretations and legal issues _meta_end_dot_

 this year s story will be broadcast on cbs s long past its prime _meta_number_ref_ minutes and the story slated to be dusted off and put on the air as new news is a five year old one that is in fact connected to the jesus tomb that of the james ossuary for the uninitiated an ossuary is a container constructed for the purpose of housing human bones _meta_end_dot_

 they can range from small clay boxes common in the ancient near east to giant buildings like the sedlec ossuary a roman chapel in czech europe that is furnished with artistically arranged bones from _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ human skeletons _meta_end_dot_

 the so called james ossuary is one of the former a small limestone box inscribed with the words ya akov bar yosef akhui diyeshua in english that is james son of joseph brother of jesus _meta_end_dot_

 the james ossuary was claimed by many including cameron and jacobovici in their _meta_number_ref_ documentary to have come from the talpiot tomb and to be further proof that jesus had a brother contrary to catholic belief _meta_end_dot_

 only nine of the ten ossuaries discovered in the talpiot tomb are currently in the possession of the israeli antiquities authority and the james ossuary has been claimed to be the tenth and missing stone box _meta_end_dot_

 however a closer look at this story reveals a tangled web of forgery deceit lies and criminal prosecution all of which culminated in the door being closed on the james ossuary years ago not that facts would influence cbs s decision about airing the story on an easter sunday five years after the james ossuary was debunked _meta_end_dot_

 after all with no new pointy sticks to poke the christian population with and with a need for something far more spectacular than cartoons or stuffed teddy bears to get a rise out of the christian community unlike their muslim brethren a recycled sensationalist story had to beat no story at all _meta_end_dot_

 so with the introduction having been covered let us delve into the true story of the james ossuary a story which for those who are not familiar with its sordid intricacies and machinations may seem too remarkable to even be real _meta_end_dot_
