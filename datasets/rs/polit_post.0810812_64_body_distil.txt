  if you want to understand precisely why barack obama s sneering condescension towards the beliefs and culture of ordinary voters and willingness to treat them as irrational prejudices is a concern in presidential politics you really need look no further than what happens when such attitudes are brought to the supreme court whose justices senator obama wants to pick _meta_end_dot_

 check out the conclusion of justice scalia s brief but masterful concurring opinion yesterday baze v _meta_end_dot_

 rees taking justice stevens to task for his separate opinion urging that the death penalty be held unconstitutional under the eighth amendment a position the court had taken once before only to be reversed by justices then including stevens himself despite the many state and federal legislatures that have repeatedly endorsed it the many juries that have imposed it the studies supporting its effects and the fact that the constitution itself makes explicit references to the death penalty read on _meta_end_dot_

 bold added italics in original _meta_end_dot_

 read the whole thing as i said it s pretty short as justice thomas separate concurrence there were seven separate opinions does the heavy historical lifting _meta_end_dot_

 now take note here it s not justice scalia in this debate who wants to take the issue of the death penalty away from the people of kentucky and make it a matter to be determined by presidential appointees it s justice stevens _meta_end_dot_

 i think a lot of americans wish that we had presidential politics free of hot button cultural issues but it s not conservatives who are the main obstacle to doing that _meta_end_dot_

 yet if you listened to senator obama last night he would still have you believe that there s something wrong with voters who care about the rights and democratic privileges that people like senator obama want to bring under federal control in other words you re only supposed to vote about what obama says you should vote about even when washington is busy meddling in other areas of life _meta_end_dot_

 on the wedge issues people who agree with obama should just be given a free hand _meta_end_dot_

 it s also rather rich for obama to suggest that guns should not be a political issue given his own record of voting to restrict gun ownership i guess he cast those votes because he was too bitter to stick to economic issues eh _meta_end_dot_

 cases like baze vividly illustrate that for the foreseeable future the presidential power to appoint federal judges will have an outsized impact on the resolution of hot button or wedge issues _meta_end_dot_

 i understand full well why given the unpopularity of rule by judicial fiat for liberal ends senator obama doesn t want voters to consider those aspects of the president s powers in voting for who the president should be _meta_end_dot_

 but i very much doubt that most voters are such ignorant rubes that they don t realize that a president obama would be quite happy to use his powers to advance his own values not theirs _meta_end_dot_
