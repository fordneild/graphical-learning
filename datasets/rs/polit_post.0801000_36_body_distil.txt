 as you can tell i write here a lot _meta_end_dot_

 writing is an itch of mine and i have to scratch it but writing just anywhere is hardly a rewarding enterprise _meta_end_dot_

 no _meta_end_dot_

 a good forum is a dream come true for any writer of his or her salt _meta_end_dot_

 a good forum of course means that more eyeballs linger on one s writing _meta_end_dot_

 but it also means that a writer will be able to interact with a really smart really talented really passionate and really well informed audience _meta_end_dot_

 redstate is such a forum _meta_end_dot_
