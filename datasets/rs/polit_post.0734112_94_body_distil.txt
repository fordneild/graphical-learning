  yesterday house minority leader john boehner missed a couple of great opportunities _meta_end_dot_

 in the hotly contested primary in md _meta_number_ref_ mr boehner endorsed the candidacy of the incumbent wayne gilchrest _meta_end_dot_

 why mr _meta_end_dot_

 boehner felt it necessary to weigh in on the primary in a safe republican district borders on the inexplicable _meta_end_dot_

 this is not the case of a arlen specter v _meta_end_dot_

 pat toomey race where the incumbent was viewed as the only way to retain a seat _meta_end_dot_

 selling out principle for power can be a disgusting act to watch but rarely does it leave one scratching their butt in wonderment _meta_end_dot_

 md _meta_number_ref_ absent an act of god is going to have a republican representative _meta_end_dot_

 we documented repeatedly on wayne gilchrest s dubious claim to being a member of the republican caucus _meta_end_dot_

 he is the only republican to have voted to override all five of president bush s vetoes _meta_end_dot_

 he has resolutely pursued defeat in iraq even to the extent of supporting the odious john murtha s attempts to defund the war while leaving the troops in combat _meta_end_dot_

 he votes for every bit of pork that comes down the pike _meta_end_dot_

 what is notable about his support of pork is that none of it arrives in mr _meta_end_dot_

 gilchrest s stronghold in the economically depressed eastern shore of maryland though mr _meta_end_dot_

 gilchrest has a pattern of showing up in even numbered years and promising to build this wharf or dredge that channel promises which never seem to materialize _meta_end_dot_

 mr _meta_end_dot_

 boehner himself is well acquainted with the inconstancy and pliable loyalty of mr _meta_end_dot_

 gilchrest _meta_end_dot_

 in the race for house minority leader mr gilchrest promised his support to mr _meta_end_dot_

 boehner then jumped ship to support representative roy blunt _meta_end_dot_

 the best choice for mr _meta_end_dot_

 boehner would have been to take a bit of advice from jacques chirac _meta_end_dot_

 it would have cost him nothing and had the added virtue of being the right thing to do _meta_end_dot_

 if he couldn t do that then the next best would have been to endorse one of the two conservative challengers in the race and try to create a more cohesive republican caucus _meta_end_dot_

 why he couldn t restrain himself or failing that act to strengthen the party is a mystery _meta_end_dot_
