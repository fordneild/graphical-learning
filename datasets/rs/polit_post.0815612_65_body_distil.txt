  hi guys _meta_end_exclamation_

 hope that you re not too hung over after all last night your candidate announced that he had won the nomination fight and whether or not he has or whether or not he is even sure of the basic details it must have been an exciting time for you _meta_end_dot_

 and now you re probably all full of vim and vigor ready to take on the gop but hold up for a second _meta_end_dot_

 there s still a small problem for you _meta_end_dot_

 there s a lot of people who are now saying that senator hillary clinton has to concede the nomination now _meta_end_dot_

 let us assume assume for the moment that this is correct or rather that she will concede _meta_end_dot_

 unfortunately for the democrats she would still have a weapon in that scenario she can go quietly or she can go out with guns blazing _meta_end_dot_

 the democratic party can t afford guns blazing at this point so she can negotiate _meta_end_dot_

 and what is the absolute rock bottom not negotiable thing that she d need _meta_end_question_

 that s right debt relief _meta_end_dot_

 total debt relief _meta_end_dot_

 yeah go get that aspirin now _meta_end_dot_

 i d also recommend some water _meta_end_dot_

 read on _meta_end_dot_

 this article guessed wrong on last night s events but it does estimate the current campaign debt of the clinton campaign as being between _meta_number_ref_ and _meta_number_ref_ million dollars at least _meta_number_ref_ of which is a loan from herself _meta_end_dot_

 let us split the difference and use the number _meta_number_ref_ million _meta_end_dot_

 that has to be paid off by somebody and somebody would be barack obama _meta_end_dot_

 but where he get the money _meta_end_question_

 three options _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 he covers it himself _meta_end_dot_

 even though he crested in april he still has _meta_number_ref_ million in the bank as of may _meta_end_dot_

 he hands it over she shakes his hand for the camera and smiles and _meta_number_ref_ million gets him what _meta_number_ref_ million couldn t her out of the race and out of the way _meta_end_dot_

 easy as pie right _meta_end_question_

 except of course for two things _meta_end_dot_

 one it ll wipe out his cash advantage at precisely the time where mccain s revenue generation is revving up _meta_end_dot_

 two it ll mean that every donor that ever gave money to the obama campaign would have been financially better off if they had taken their total contribution divided it by about nine and sent the money directly to hillary with a note that this was to be used strictly for paying off debts _meta_end_dot_

 put another way the obaman roi was already miserable _meta_end_dot_

 this scenario sends it through the floor _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 get it from the party _meta_end_dot_

 why not _meta_end_question_

 why should obama handle this personally _meta_end_question_

 it s the party s fault that the system s such a mess and never mind his own role in manipulating that mess so the party can clean it up themselves _meta_end_dot_

 they can shovel out the cash to get her out of the way _meta_end_dot_

 except _meta_end_dot_

 the dnc as of may had _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ million in the bank in fact if obama s really the nominee howard dean needs him to pony up some money right now for the convention _meta_end_dot_

 the dscc has _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ million on hand nrsc has _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ million the dccc has _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ million nrcc has _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ million _meta_end_dot_

 even if you split the burden in half between those two groups that means _meta_dollor_ref_ million gone from each _meta_end_dot_

 and they re roughly at parity on monthly fundraising with their gop equivalents and the rnc has _meta_number_ref_ million in the bank _meta_end_dot_

 translation getting rid of clinton this way would negate the cash advantage that the democratic party currently enjoys _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 go to rich donors _meta_end_dot_

 this is the most likely scenario of course _meta_end_dot_

 find _meta_number_ref_ people willing and able to shell out _meta_number_ref_ grand apiece flash the smile turn on the charm avoid a major gaffe and the money is hillary s _meta_end_dot_

 barack obama could get that done in a dinner if the guest list is carefully designed and it won t cost him more than a couple of million to put together _meta_end_dot_

 he s got the money for that and he d rather spend two than thirty _meta_end_dot_

 no problems right _meta_end_question_

 well _meta_end_dot_

 first off those donors would now be effectively tapped out _meta_end_dot_

 after all they shelled out _meta_number_ref_ grand to save the party they ve done their bit _meta_end_dot_

 obama wants more from them after that they re going to want something in exchange _meta_end_dot_

 something that s worth the money that they ve spent in addition to the money that they re being hit up for _meta_end_dot_

 and those will be the honest ones _meta_end_dot_

 the not quite so honest ones will expect a quid pro quo for their favor to the candidate once he s in office _meta_end_dot_

 and if he doesn t give it to them they will turn his name to mud in democratic circles _meta_end_dot_

 in other words this scenario makes the supposedly people s candidate pre beholden to even more of a large shadowy group of rich democrats than is normally the case and if one man decides to step in and pay the whole thing _meta_end_dot_

 then my grudging but sincere congratulations george _meta_end_dot_

 i know that you ve always wanted to just go out and buy a presidential candidate _meta_end_dot_

 so let s recap _meta_end_dot_

 to make hillary clinton go away barack obama needs to at minimum either use his contributors money to pay her off erase the party s money advantage to pay her off go into debt with a bunch of plutocrats to pay her off hand over title to his won soul to one guy or at best a cartel to pay her off or maybe try to do all of this at once because muddling up an already complicated situation is of course the hallmark of a true democratic party politician _meta_end_dot_

 you sure that you want this woman out of the race _meta_end_question_

 have a nice morning _meta_end_dot_
