  mike huckabee is rising steadily in nationwide polls and that isn t good for the republican party _meta_end_dot_

 there is now a split among four main candidates excluding john mccain rudy giuliani mitt romney huckabee and arguably some would say fred thompson _meta_end_dot_

 people like huckabee for his southern charm calm speech and ability to connect due in large part to his role as a minister _meta_end_dot_

 he has performed impressively at every republican debate and been generous with his time to news stations print publications and radio interviews unlike some of the frontrunners who barely return press phone calls but i won t name any names huckabee has stuck it out but for what end _meta_end_question_

 when he spoke with human events in june before the huckalove was flowing he was irritated with the assumption that his campaign wasn t gaining more attention read below to find out what he said and more clearly the times have changed but huckabee is detracting attention from the candidate who might actually win the national election _meta_end_dot_

 despite his claims of being the real conservative we know that s not true _meta_end_dot_

 the club for growth has ripped him over and over for his tax policies and he s altered views on immigration _meta_end_dot_

 he has a new immigration plan out but he told human events that he didn t want to punish illegal immigrant children for their parent s crimes so he would like to include a scholarship program for them _meta_end_dot_

 in an interview with real clear politics in march of this year huckabee said the following about immigration issues that was back before the bush mccain immigration bill was squashed _meta_end_dot_

 now huckabee s not so lenient about his tone towards the issue _meta_end_dot_

 his new plan is pretty tough but again it causes one to wonder how much he s played it up because of the killed bill _meta_end_dot_

 besides his questionable stances on these key issues and as much as i like him personally i don t see him beating hillary clinton or barack obama in the national election _meta_end_dot_

 apparantly the the democrat party agrees with me _meta_end_dot_

 headlined on drudge today jonah goldberg summed huckabee up recently saying a devout social conservative on issues such as abortion school prayer homosexuality and evolution huckabee s a populist on economics a fad follower on the environment and al all around do gooder who believes that the biblical obligation to do good works extends to using government and your tax dollars to bring us closer to the kingdom of heaven on earth last but certainly not least he harbors little foreign policy experience and though his thoughts on how to combat islamic extremism and win the war on terror point in the right direction his steps toward success are often vague and wordy _meta_end_dot_

 mike huckabee is a great guy trying to the right thing but becoming president of the united states isn t where he s headed _meta_end_dot_

 we may not have the greatest choices this election but the more there are the less of a chance we have of actually achieving a republican victory _meta_beep_ref_ break
