  but not now _meta_end_dot_

 this defeat is total _meta_end_dot_

 the shame and horror of it is epic and only possibly approached by the fact that mcclatchy gets to gloat about it and in such a comprehensive fashion _meta_end_dot_

 as will the rest of the planet probably _meta_end_dot_

 they ve always known that we were doomed _meta_end_dot_

 oh yes i admit it now that the magnitude of these losses have been revealed this is not the first incident you see we re only just starting to hear about it now _meta_end_dot_

 i always feared that this day would come _meta_end_dot_

 no i lie i always knew that this day would come _meta_end_dot_

 we could never hope to win this sort of struggle _meta_end_dot_

 you know it feels so good to finally say that you know _meta_end_question_

 we ve pretended for so long that we could do this when everything about our history told us that we couldn t _meta_end_dot_
