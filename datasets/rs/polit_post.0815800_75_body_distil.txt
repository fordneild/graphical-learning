  we will be opening up the beta site to the public _meta_end_dot_

 we ll have the site up and running for you to get in and get comfortable with _meta_end_dot_

 at the same time we ll be running final tests while you kick the tires _meta_end_dot_

 we expect that having a large audience will reveal a few unknown bugs _meta_end_dot_

 because of that we won t be going immediately to the new site as our new home _meta_end_dot_

 after making sure the tire kicking did not cause any problems this site will become an archive and the new site will be our home _meta_end_dot_

 over time we hope to port content over _meta_end_dot_

 none of the content here will be erased _meta_end_dot_

 all of the content at the new site will be erased before we go live with it as our home _meta_end_dot_

 we will also transfer over all user names and passwords at that time _meta_end_dot_

 you will not have to get a new account _meta_end_dot_

 see you all at the new site tomorrow _meta_end_dot_
