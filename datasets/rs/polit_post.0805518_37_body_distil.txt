 pawlenty who looked like joel osteen this am said that minnesota a blue state is in a drift toward becoming a competitive state sanford said that the republican numbers in south carolina are just overwhelming from virginia kaine said he thinks obama has an excellent chance corzine admitted that john mccain played to a centrist element in joisey but he remains impressed by the enthusiasm generated by the democrats _meta_end_dot_

 he s a hillary supporter but he had to mean the enthusiasm generated by barry asked about the dem superdelegates kaine said that they will vote for the person with the momentum _meta_end_dot_

 corzine agreed but added that he thinks the momentum will be with hillary _meta_end_dot_

 asking about the veep possibilities wallace mentioned a column which called pawlenty a liberal on matters of government spending immigration and the environment _meta_end_dot_

 pawlenty countered that the writer was a minnesota radio talker with issues and pointed out that he is a fiscal conservative who is very busy and happy being the governor of minnesota _meta_end_dot_

 asked about his veep chances sanford repeated the bit about the busy day job but added that mccain has come his way on immigration i e securing the border first _meta_end_dot_

 kaine was asked about his veep chances on an obama ticket and he said that he was borrowing the busy day job answer _meta_end_dot_

 he said that it was nice to be on the list _meta_end_dot_

 corzine was not asked about whether he would like to be veep but he did say that neither hillary nor obama would raise taxes on the middle class _meta_end_dot_

 he said that the solution to our fiscal ills was to cut spending on our war and redirected it toward domestic areas _meta_end_dot_

 sanford said that he is amenable to discussion of federal mandates for clean energy _meta_end_dot_

 kaine said that we need a national plan for clean energy and corzine agreed i think we need mandates joe biden on tw _meta_end_dot_

 on abc s this week this week host george stephanopoulos began his show by talking to joe biden just back from the region asked about barry s pledge to invade pakistan if he thought osama bin laden were hiding there biden explained that this has long been u s _meta_end_dot_

 government policy and he s troubled that mccain would forget this _meta_end_dot_

 he agreed that musharraf ought to have an exit strategy to leave the pakistani government with honor _meta_end_dot_

 he referred to it as an easy way to transition musharraf out of there joe biden declared that we did the right think by recognizing kosovo _meta_end_dot_

 he said that serbia has a choice between east and west here he talked about joining nato _meta_end_dot_

 joe biden said that the situation in kosovo is not as dire as the media portrays is to be _meta_end_dot_

 asked about his role as a dem superdelegate joe biden said that even though delaware went for barry by ten points he does not feel obligated to support him when he dons the tights and cape he did state however that he thinks the superdelegates will fall in line with the will of the party _meta_end_dot_

 joe biden said that they ll have to accommodate the delegates from florida and michigan or risk losing those states in november but that being said joe biden argued florida and michigan cannot be the states which push hillary over the top kay bailey hutchison on tw _meta_end_dot_

 she was just back from iraq alack alack and texas republican senator kay bailey hutchison told steph that we re making huge strides forward in iraq thanks in large part to help from the sunnis _meta_end_dot_

 she did not mention the shi ite mookie asked about the lack of progress in iraq she said that there was progress but that we expect things to happen so fast she d like to see iraq paying for its own infrastructure _meta_end_dot_

 after all she pointed out the oil is flowing and it would free some of the u s _meta_end_dot_

 money for spending elsewhere _meta_end_dot_

 she argued that the new pakistani government must not be heavy handed or ham handed asked about the veepstakes which word i do not like but use anyway she said simply i do not want to be vice president ralph nader on tw _meta_end_dot_

 tim russert accused ralph nader of help ing to elect george bush in _meta_number_ref_ then sought to find out if nader would run again this year _meta_end_dot_

 nader began his response let me put it in context to make it a little more palatable to people who have closed minds he used the results of several polls to conclude that americans think this country is moving in the wrong direction blame both parties and would consider voting for an independent in the presidential election _meta_end_dot_

 yes ralph nader is running _meta_end_dot_

 the suspense is over _meta_end_dot_

 the rest was his prattle about corporations _meta_end_dot_

 russert was glum _meta_end_dot_

 he showed the popular vote total from _meta_number_ref_ with al gore beating george bush by half a percent and nader sneaking in with _meta_number_ref_ _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 russert showed the florida vote count with bush winning by _meta_number_ref_ votes but nader taking _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ votes which russert feels were really gore votes _meta_end_dot_

 you ralph nader are responsible for what has happened in the last seven years he attempted to put those words into the mouths of democrats but he didn t name one _meta_end_dot_

 they are his sentiments nader said that gore did win florida but that it was stolen from him by katherine harris and jeb bush _meta_end_dot_

 he also argued against turning the government over to big business russert played a clip of obama dismissing nader and nader countered that obama s views have changed to conform with those of the israeli lobby to one of blind support for the israeli government and their illegal occupation of palestine russert ignored the anti semitism and went back to nader taking votes from obama _meta_end_dot_

 nader countered that if the dems cannot bury the pro war john mccain who identifies himself with the criminal recidivistic regime of george bush they ought to go out of business _meta_end_dot_

 so really it seems that nader s main problem with obama is that the dem candidate doesn t profess the requisite antipathy toward israel _meta_end_dot_

 that s why nader is running then to stop the nation of israel _meta_end_dot_

 granholm and napolitano on ftn _meta_end_dot_

 black said the times had been hoisted by its own petard schieffer then began to ask black about the unsubstantiated specifics such as they were in the times article _meta_end_dot_

 huckabee said he wants fair tax and human life amendment _meta_end_dot_

 he also pointed out that not all delegates are pledged delegates and this could go to the convention _meta_end_dot_

 reagan _meta_end_dot_

 pawlenty didn t say this behind his joe osteen smile but how many conservatives are concerned because they believe that john mccain is older than president reagan _meta_end_question_

 the sound of the interview moved into a pipe and king might have cut the interview short or might have been anxious to speak with chuck hagel _meta_end_dot_

 chuck hagel on le _meta_end_dot_

 king s big question was would hagel support his party s nominee _meta_end_question_

 he s taken the maverick republican mantle from mccain just in time to get out of the senate _meta_end_dot_

 king said that hagel had been mentioned as a possible republican candidate and a possible running mate with mike bloomberg _meta_end_dot_

 hagel said he s out of the mix and he called this unpredictable vis vis nader s candidacy and that democracy is about a choice _meta_end_dot_
