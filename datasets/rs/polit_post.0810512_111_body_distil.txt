  nine years ago today was the last time john f _meta_end_dot_

 kerry successfully sponsored legislation _meta_end_dot_

 that at its core is the basic function of a senator it seems to legislate _meta_end_dot_

 as a small government kind of guy i rather applaud john kerry s inability or inept ability to do his job _meta_end_dot_

 of course i m reminded that in _meta_number_ref_ he ran for president on a long list of things that needed to be done and given his ability to actually use his present position to do something he has failed to put theresa s money where his mouth is _meta_end_dot_

 if you want to get in on the fun go sign this anniversary card for senator kerry _meta_end_dot_
