  thirty five years ago today the supreme court of the united states held in roe v _meta_end_dot_

 wade that a woman has a constitutional right to kill her unborn child _meta_end_dot_

 there is much i could say about roe which i believe is hands down the worst judicial decision in the history of our constitutional republic _meta_end_dot_

 but for today i will hold my tongue _meta_end_dot_

 instead i would like to acknowledge the tireless efforts of the foot soliders in the pro life movement many of whom will brave the cold today to stand up for a culture of life in this country _meta_end_dot_

 god bless you all _meta_end_dot_

 thank you for being a voice for the voiceless for being people who are willing to defend the most vulnerable members of our society _meta_end_dot_

 it is a call that we all should heed _meta_end_dot_

 as pope john paul the great once remarked and to that all i can add is amen _meta_end_dot_
