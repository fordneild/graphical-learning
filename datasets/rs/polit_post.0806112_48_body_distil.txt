  took em long enough the link above by the way is not to the original which is behind a subscription wall it s to an upset netrooter albeit one not as upset as s he will be once this passes _meta_end_dot_

 alternatively you can read karl of protein wisdom who is just about as amused over this as i am _meta_end_dot_

 no further commentary necessary except that i really wish that the democrats would start subordinating their primary fund raising requirements to their responsibilities as legislators instead of the other way around _meta_end_dot_

 i understand that they don t want to pass fisa with retroactive immunity until after their post _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ revenue generation blitz but if they had just passed this two weeks ago they wouldn t be in this mess _meta_end_dot_

 fourteen days is plenty of time for the netroots to get over a fit of pique _meta_end_dot_
