  scott at power line reports that nbc has backed down or has decided to amend its standards and practices from its refusal to air the freedom s watch holiday ads thanking the troops _meta_end_dot_

 is it merely a coincidence that this public reversal came just over three hours after the majority accountability project on this site revealed that the nbc lawyer who refused to allow the ads had donated at least _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ to a host of congressional democrats including house speaker nancy pelosi new york senator hillary clinton and the campaign committees of house and senate democrats _meta_end_question_

 i prefer to think not _meta_end_dot_

 either way though the ads are going to get the airplay that they deserve this holiday season a good result however you view this case _meta_end_dot_
