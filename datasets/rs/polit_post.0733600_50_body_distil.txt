  it s impossible for me to support ron paul in his quest to become the republican presidential nominee in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 while the libertarian part of my libertarian conservative self is interested in certain discrete aspects of the paulian message free trade free markets fiscal discipline and small government being those aspects it seems to me that in too many instances ron paul s policy goals are frustrated by the very proposals paul puts forth _meta_end_dot_

 consider free trade _meta_end_dot_

 paul supports it very strongly and says that he wants to trade freely with other countries _meta_end_dot_

 a laudable position _meta_end_dot_

 and yet he also argues that the united states ought to withdraw from institutions like the world trade organization _meta_end_dot_

 the problem of course is that membership in the wto is a great way to resolve trade disputes without resorting to destructive tools like unilateral tariffs as we learned in the case of china _meta_end_dot_

 without american membership in the wto the united states was more likely to resort to unilateral tariffs to address the issue of alleged chinese export subsidies _meta_end_dot_

 and in case you need reminding unilateral tariffs are a clumsy policy tool _meta_end_dot_

 take as well paul s foreign policy of non interventionism _meta_end_dot_

 i am a non non interventionist myself since non interventionism is not even remotely a palatable foreign policy option for the united states _meta_end_dot_

 non interventionism and neutrality was a smart move when we were starting out as a nation and had to navigate between the scylla of britain a great empire our maternal country and the one with which we had the closest cultural ties even after the american revolution and the charybdis of france our indispensable ally in the revolution and yet a country with which tensions arose in the wake of the xyz affair and in the wake of the french revolution and the attendant terror _meta_end_dot_

 america projected little power abroad and by maintaining a policy of neutrality it left no vacuum for others to step into _meta_end_dot_

 the policy made sense and the reason why washington s farewell address was and is so respected is because it took such a realistic and cold eyed view of the state of play regarding american foreign policy _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 matters to say the least have changed since washington s time _meta_end_dot_

 we are the most powerful country in the world perhaps the most powerful in history after all relevant factors have been taken into account _meta_end_dot_

 if we withdraw from the world and pursue paul s policy of non interventionism we will leave a gigantic vacuum and we have to wonder about who will fill it _meta_end_dot_

 and once again even if one embraces paul s vision of non interventionism one finds that paul s specific policies will undermine the very cause of non interventionism he advocates _meta_end_dot_

 paul wants us to pull out of various international organizations _meta_end_dot_

 but the next time a crisis develops that demands an international response thanks to our non intervention we will be in no position to exercise any influence whatsoever and i include diplomatic influence in the mix _meta_end_dot_

 after all we would no longer have any kind of membership in international organizations through which we traditionally exercised influence assuming that we follow paul s policy of non interventionism _meta_end_dot_

 if we are in no position to exercise diplomatic influence we will also be in no position to help elevate diplomacy over force when the former is called for over the latter _meta_end_dot_

 end result the increased chance of more war in potentially cataclysmic circumstances where american interventionism could have helped bring about a peaceful outcome either purely through diplomacy or through a threat of force combined with diplomacy that ultimately resolves a situation without actual shots being fired and actual blood being shed _meta_end_dot_

 i understand the appeal of ron paul _meta_end_dot_

 but ultimately his cause is sabotaged by the candidate espousing it _meta_end_dot_

 that s not a candidacy i can get behind _meta_end_dot_

 and i don t see why anyone else would want to _meta_end_dot_
