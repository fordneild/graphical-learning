  i only caught some of the debate but it was a disaster for hillary clinton _meta_end_dot_

 she skipped over questions that discomforted her and boy were there a lot of them _meta_end_dot_

 she was tedious exhibiting an instinct for the capillaries that had to have had her supporters cringing in agony _meta_end_dot_

 was it really worth it to whine about how she got the first question and then bring up the saturday night live about the media showing favoritism towards obama _meta_end_question_

 to be sure the skit was right and hillary clinton had reason to complain but if she didn t actually believe that she would come out of that exchange looking badly she has learned nothing whatsoever from her time on the campaign trail _meta_end_dot_

 equally horrible was the comment about how she just doesn t have time to release her taxes or that barack obama was not sufficiently anti anti semitic when he said that he denounced louis farrakhan as opposed to rejecting farrakhan _meta_end_dot_

 really the whole thing was pathetic beyond measure _meta_end_dot_

 i know that it is common practice to believe that hillary clinton is the smartest woman in the world or something along those lines _meta_end_dot_

 but her side of the debate looked clumsy amateurish and dumb beyond measure _meta_end_dot_

 meanwhile obama was cool confident comfortable in his own skin and looked like a winner _meta_end_dot_

 i take no joy in writing that because i would much rather have john mccain face hillary clinton in the general election it would be a far easier campaign for mccain to win after all _meta_end_dot_

 but despite my earlier confidence that somehow someway hillary clinton would find a way to pull through it is obvious that it s just not going to happen _meta_end_dot_

 one way or the other barack obama will be the democratic nominee _meta_end_dot_

 and republicans will be in for an epic battle _meta_end_dot_

 don t believe me _meta_end_question_

 then read this _meta_end_dot_

 no barack obama is not ronald reagan _meta_end_dot_

 but he stands to profit from being underestimated by his foes just as reagan did _meta_end_dot_

 perhaps someone would want to see to it that such a luxury is denied obama _meta_end_dot_

 assuming that republicans want to win of course _meta_end_dot_
