  though i haven t done a magisterial pejmanesque endorsement i continue to support fred thompson for the gop nomination _meta_end_dot_

 however maybe it s a form of ethno religious identification that leads me to stand up for mike huckabee _meta_end_dot_

 okay huckabee is taking money from churches to speak _meta_end_dot_

 the guy as he has pointed out in his own speeches is not wealthy _meta_end_dot_

 he can t afford to run while resting on interest from a fortune _meta_end_dot_

 i don t think that s a big strike against him _meta_end_dot_

 i question whether churches should spend their money that way but i don t see this as some great demerit against the huckster _meta_end_dot_

 and yes he has agreed to speak at john hagee s church which is more or less very hard on catholics _meta_end_dot_

 hey so is bob jones university and nobody is jacking up mitt romney for courting the endorsement of top officers at bju _meta_end_dot_

 neither were many outside the mccain campaign complaining when g w _meta_end_dot_

 bush spoke at bob jones in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 bob jones university has been a standard campaign stop in south carolina for gop hopefuls for decades _meta_end_dot_

 there may be a very strong moral case against huckabee s character but i don t think we re seeing it just yet _meta_end_dot_

 this is still pretty thin gruel _meta_end_dot_

 end _meta_end_dot_
