  one does get more than a little sick and tired of claims on the part of both barack obama and hillary clinton that john mccain wants to keep americans in iraq for _meta_number_ref_ years honest reporting just does not bear these claims out _meta_end_dot_

 the washington post calls out the obama and clinton claims for the nonsensical statements that they are here is factcheck org on the issue here is the columbia journalism review piling on is indeed lying about what mccain really said isn t it _meta_end_question_

 either that or barack obama and hillary clinton are the most utterly misinformed people on the planet _meta_end_dot_
