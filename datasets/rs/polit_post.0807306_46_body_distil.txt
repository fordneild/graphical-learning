  yes i stole the title from somewhere else on the web but it seems to work for our purposes _meta_end_dot_

 in any event it is finally over _meta_end_dot_

 and while i have a lot of sympathy for eliot spitzer s family i don t have all that much for him _meta_end_dot_

 in fact i daresay that this is karma at work _meta_end_dot_

 mind you i am not a prude though breaking the law is breaking the law _meta_end_dot_

 but what is especially noteworthy about all of this is the fact that eliot spitzer is being raked over the coals in much the same manner that he raked others over the coals when he was attorney general for the state of new york _meta_end_dot_

 only the u s _meta_end_dot_

 attorney dealing with this case is actually being far nicer to spitzer than spitzer was to many of the people he persecuted _meta_end_dot_

 yes that s right _meta_end_dot_

 i wrote persecuted not prosecuted persecuted there is a reason for this _meta_end_dot_

 read on _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 let s start by examining spitzer s favorite weapon against wall street the martin act _meta_end_dot_

 here is a description of the power that can be wielded through the act those people _meta_end_dot_

 funny thing those same people cheered eliot spitzer on as he used the martin act on his prey denied them the right to counsel when he questioned them and took away their fifth amendment rights during the course of the questioning as well _meta_end_dot_

 let that sink in _meta_end_dot_

 i use the word vengeance deliberately _meta_end_dot_

 here is why note as well the fact that spitzer s record as a successful prosecutor was entirely overblown are good at their craft prosecutors with whom spitzer is now reduced to bargaining for his freedom and his good name _meta_end_dot_

 oh and in the event that you think the abuses stopped when spitzer stopped being the attorney general and started being the governor well think again yeah nothing like perverting the written text of the law to suit your own policy preferences eh _meta_end_question_

 really i couldn t write a villain this bad if i tried and if you paid me gobs and gobs of money to do it _meta_end_dot_

 spitzer was almost universally praised as a brilliant policy wonk whose grasp of substance was utterly admirable and who possessed a command of facts and philosophy that was broad and deep _meta_end_dot_

 but you really wouldn t get that impression if you read some of the things he said when it came to policy issues hey did i mention just how vengeful eliot spitzer was _meta_end_question_

 richard nixon looked like the essence of charm and charisma when compared to this guy just keep popping up don t they _meta_end_question_

 want to check out one of the now outdated media hosannas to their fallen hero _meta_end_question_

 try this one _meta_end_dot_

 note the laughable attacks against the chicago school of economics by the very same guy who was not sure what his own theory of regulation was except that he knew it involved him getting lots and lots of good press _meta_end_dot_

 note as well the comparison between ronald reagan and the guy who killed bruce wayne s parents i like comic books too and i am as partisan as they come but _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 um _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 really _meta_end_question_

 reagan as malevolent inspiration for a real life dark knight _meta_end_question_

 come one _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 bruce wayne didn t engage in structuring transactions and i am pretty sure he never had to violate the mann act in order to get a pretty face to gaze lovingly at him for a two hour minimum _meta_end_dot_

 but the most important thing you ought to note is the following passage from the hosanna filled article john podhoretz eliot spitzer wanted what he wanted when he wanted it _meta_end_dot_

 that is the consistent pattern of his public life and it is why america will be a better place when the only power he has left is the power to hurt the people closest to him not that those people don t deserve better than spitzer of course _meta_end_dot_

 good riddance _meta_end_dot_
