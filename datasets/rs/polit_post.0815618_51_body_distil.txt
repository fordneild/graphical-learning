  while i feel a bit of pity mixed with glee at the tragic fate of hillary clinton i think the democrats should be applauded for following the bible _meta_end_dot_

 a woman should learn in quietness and full submission _meta_end_dot_

 i do not permit a woman to teach or to have authority over a man she must be silent the bible teaches in _meta_number_ref_ timothy _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 likewise the next chapter makes clear that overseers or leaders should be men not women _meta_end_dot_

 the democrats have taken to the bible _meta_end_dot_

 of course in the history of this country women have always taken it on the chin in favor of not just the man but the black man _meta_end_dot_

 we could not expect the democrats to defy history _meta_end_dot_

 we would do well to remember that women were on the verge of getting the right to vote before the civil war but the war interrupted the movement _meta_end_dot_

 women sat by patiently for the end of the war _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ looked promising _meta_end_dot_

 the nation had before it the _meta_number_ref_th amendment giving all citizens the right to vote _meta_end_dot_

 except the amendment decided to make citizens and voters equal to men only _meta_end_dot_

 the women s movement protested and fought but they were outmaneuvered by an eloquent black man named frederick douglass _meta_end_dot_

 and black men won the vote leaving all women out in the cold _meta_end_dot_

 in _meta_number_ref_ things looked very promising _meta_end_dot_

 in _meta_number_ref_ jeannette rankin of montana became the first woman elected to the congress _meta_end_dot_

 but then war broke out _meta_end_dot_

 from _meta_number_ref_ to _meta_number_ref_ women again sat on the sidelines while the men took care of business _meta_end_dot_

 in _meta_number_ref_ women got the right to vote _meta_end_dot_

 fast forward to _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 hillary clinton was set to become the first woman elected president of the united states finally capping the long struggle for equal rights _meta_end_dot_

 though deeply unpopular with a lot of the country people were still willing to vote for her for president _meta_end_dot_

 of course students of the women s movement should have seen it coming but they didn t _meta_end_dot_

 an eloquent black man came on to the scene and talked people out of a giant leap for womankind _meta_end_dot_

 and just as it happened so often in this country yet again women s hopes have been crushed _meta_end_dot_

 i await the feminists new strategy of scrapping affirmative action except for women _meta_end_dot_

 ladies back to the kitchen please _meta_end_dot_

 mr _meta_end_dot_

 obama is hungry _meta_end_dot_
