  congressman paul kanjorski d pa has been a fairly undistinguished member of the house of representatives for nearly a quarter of a century _meta_end_dot_

 he is a career member of the financial services committee who has made little or no name for himself since his first electoral victory and has maintained incumbency through the funneling of pork back to his district _meta_end_dot_

 even his wikipedia entry says that kanjorski usually plays behind the scenes roles in the advocacy or defeat of legislation and steers appropriations money toward improving the infrastructure and economic needs of his district never one to stand out in a crowd outside of his own district if he could help it up until now rep _meta_end_dot_

 kanjorski s public life may be about to change in a major way very very quickly and for a very big reason _meta_end_dot_

 you see paul kanjorski has an honesty problem _meta_end_dot_

 more specifically paul kanjorski s problem is that he was publicly honest about the intentional dis honesty of congressional democrats and democrat candidates in the run up to the _meta_number_ref_ election particularly with regard to the war in iraq _meta_end_dot_

 watch the video below a transcript follows transcript simply gave the president nearly every single thing he asked for without putting up any real fight as opposed to the semifrequent yet brief preening for the cameras moments of solely rhetorical dissent _meta_end_dot_

 the impression the democratic congress gave during those minor at best wars over the continuation of the war was that it was simply incompetent _meta_end_dot_

 reps _meta_end_dot_

 pelosi hoyer et al wanted to end the war as soon as possible at least that s what they kept saying _meta_end_dot_

 unfortunately for those who largely elected them on that basis the best and brightest democrats in elective office were simply unable to figure out any way to outsmart and outmaneuver the buffoon in the white house on the issues of wartime budget and policy instead inadvertently i m sure ending every fight on the wrong side from their point of view having yet again given the president every single thing he was asking for _meta_end_dot_

 now rep _meta_end_dot_

 kanjorski has very publicly pulled the curtain back on the democrat congress real intent and objective _meta_end_dot_

 if we won the congressional elections he says we implied that we could stop the war yes they did that is why the netroots lined up behind these democrats with their money and their soapboxes but more importantly with their money _meta_end_dot_

 that is why the peace activist supported them ending the war now was the primary task they took on themselves to carry out and the promise to do so was the basis on which so many of them were elected or reelected _meta_end_dot_

 now the mask slips and with it comes an admitted level of condescension directed by those congressional democrats at those who were gullible enough to support them for something that they themselves knew could not be done _meta_end_dot_

 now anybody was a good student of government said kanjorski would know that wasn t true that they could stop the war fortunately for those democrats who campaigned and were elected based on their war ending promises their hardcore supporters their activists and their base of voters are all made up of people who are by mr _meta_end_dot_

 kanjorski s reckoning very very poor students of government _meta_end_dot_

 but all of that was justified to these incumbents and first time candidates _meta_end_dot_

 taking advantage of poor uneducated rubes _meta_end_question_

 abusing trust and leaving those who offered it stranded along the way _meta_end_question_

 all acceptable because again by mr _meta_end_dot_

 kanjorski s own description of the temptation to want to win back the congress we sort of stretched the facts he says _meta_end_dot_

 and people ate it up yes they did and that may well be an apt description of the fate awaiting rep _meta_end_dot_

 kanjorski himself once his fellow congressional democrats find out what secrets he has been publicly admitting _meta_end_dot_

 after all there is another election coming up in a mere five plus months and they not only need the issue of their continued purported attempts to stop the war in order to gain support but they need the votes of those same poor poor students of government who will believe every one of those stretched facts and in the words of mr _meta_end_dot_

 kajorski eat up what the democrats had hoped to offer under the guise of something that was still eminently and immintently attainable under a their congressional and presidential leadership _meta_end_dot_

 now thanks to mr _meta_end_dot_

 kanjorski that cat is out of the bag _meta_end_dot_

 he had better hope that those poor students of government are equally poor watchers of youtube and followers of the news or else the veneer of the democrat promises on iraq will be long gone courtesy of his honesty problem _meta_end_dot_
