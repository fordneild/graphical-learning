  oh what a day _meta_end_exclamation_

 geraghty reports the early exit polls show mccain _meta_number_ref_ romney _meta_number_ref_ however the polls show a lot of evangelicals and a lot of voters who care about immigration _meta_end_dot_

 as he notes on paper this is not a typical mccain voter _meta_end_dot_

 however the split of huck romney and fred might allow mccain to win the state with _meta_number_ref_ _meta_percent_ref_ of the vote _meta_end_dot_

 big caveat these are leaked exit polls before voting is complete _meta_end_dot_

 thus they could be dead accurate and still miss the mark because there is another _meta_number_ref_ minutes of voting _meta_end_dot_

 don t put too much stock in them _meta_end_dot_

 but since this is the internet let the information flow _meta_end_exclamation_
