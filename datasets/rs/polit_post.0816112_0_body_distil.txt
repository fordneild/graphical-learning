  barack obama has stated that he will not take money from pacs or federal lobbyists and that pac and lobbyist money would also be banned from the democratic national committee now that obama is the presumptive nominee and can institute such changes _meta_end_dot_

 however _meta_number_ref_ former lobbyists _meta_number_ref_ unregistered lobbying firm partners and _meta_number_ref_ state lobbyists can still give money _meta_end_dot_

 in addition both the democratic congressional campaign committee and the democratic senatorial campaign committee will continue to take money from pacs and lobbyists and the vice chair of the democratic national committee is a registered federal lobbyists _meta_end_dot_

 source _meta_end_dot_

 this is a republican national committee press release that i found on google news _meta_end_dot_

 of course the rnc is expected to take obama on with press releases criticizing his positions and there will be some who roll their eyes in non surprise at this press release _meta_end_dot_

 but of course if you can t dispute the actual information found in the press release then it really doesn t matter who the source is now does it _meta_end_question_

 recall as well that despite obama s boasts that he does not take money from oil companies mostly because corporate contributions are illegal he does however take money from oil and gas company employees a take that was in the six figures as of two months ago _meta_end_dot_

 if i had my druthers of course none of this would be that big a deal _meta_end_dot_

 stephen levitt and stephen dubner point out that money contributions do not so much influence political stances as they reward a stance that has already been taken _meta_end_dot_

 as such one does not give money to a candidate in order to try to get that candidate to vote a certain way _meta_end_dot_

 rather one gives money to a candidate in an expression of support that comes as a consequence of that candidate having taken a particular position _meta_end_dot_

 this never struck me as being anything to write home about but since obama insists on attacking john mccain for his connections to lobbyists it is only fair play to point out that the obama campaign has been rather busy doing lobbyists favors as well _meta_end_dot_
