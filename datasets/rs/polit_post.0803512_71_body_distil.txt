  i welcome absentee s recent contribution to the immigration and american culture debate _meta_end_dot_

 it s a fine diary well worth reading with care _meta_end_dot_

 in response to it i will present an observation and upon it ground an argument _meta_end_dot_

 i have been arguing about immigration on redstate from essentially the same position for three and half years _meta_end_dot_

 my interlocutors have induced me to some adjustment and recapitulations but i must confess that their arguments even the most eloquent and emphatic of them have more often than not reinforced the firmness of my opposition to our immigration regime _meta_end_dot_

 read on _meta_end_dot_

 the primary reason is that debates on the subject usually result in the exposure of a philosophy standing behind some in the pro immigration faction which in my judgment tends towards the dissolution of the country _meta_end_dot_

 a pernicious theory a parlous enthusiasm an ill conceived and dangerous doctrine in short a philosophy inherently subversive of those purposes in the furtherance of which we the people ordained and established our constitution _meta_end_dot_

 in my own mind i have not settled on a satisfactory much less a perfect formulation for this doctrine or theory _meta_end_dot_

 propositional nation is one common title for it _meta_end_dot_

 on occasion i have called it america the abstraction referring to a most excellent essay on the subject _meta_end_dot_

 but neither of these quite captures the philosophy fairly or precisely _meta_end_dot_

 the doctrine is readily apparent in the view often expressed in a rather glib manner that what is really important about america what is really worth conserving is the collection of ideas upon which she is said to be based _meta_end_dot_

 take away the idea that is america and what do you have _meta_end_question_

 nothing worth preserving i have heard this staggering question raised and answered mutatis mutandis on many occasions _meta_end_dot_

 and i will not conceal what it induces in me fear and a very urgent patriotic indignation _meta_end_dot_

 now i do not flatter myself that this theory will be settled here and now _meta_end_dot_

 far from it _meta_end_dot_

 my more modest goal is merely to establish as clearly as i can my unqualified opposition to it _meta_end_dot_

 i m not attached to america as a geographic location it s the ideas that matter _meta_end_dot_

 i don t expect to settle this theory but i do hope to convey my judgment as to where it should settle in the dustbin of history _meta_end_dot_

 so i will state my opposition in as succinct a syllogism as i can any theory of patriotism which by implication falsifies the patriotic songs of the country is a false and destructive theory _meta_end_dot_

 for there can be no doubt that virtually every patriotic song we have with the exception of the battle hymn of the republic contains a distinctive and unmistakable aspect of gratitude of celebration of joy for the unique beauty of our land _meta_end_dot_

 a theory of patriotism which begins with i m not attached to america as a geographic location will end with the singing of america the beautiful or god bless america or my country tis of thee as a kind of parody or falsehood _meta_end_dot_

 does natural beauty exhaust the sources of american patriotism _meta_end_question_

 hardly _meta_end_dot_

 and i have never denied the role of ideas in the formation of american identity _meta_end_dot_

 i may be guilty of underemphasizing it but that is only because as we can see there are many thoughtful and earnest people who are prepared to excise everything else _meta_end_dot_

 it may also be that the ideas i would point to as formative in the development of american identity are rather different from those commonly presented as formative _meta_end_dot_

 i would drastically underrate for instance the notion of openness which i think is an anachronistic imposition from the late twentieth century _meta_end_dot_

 i would also underrate less drastically but still decisively the importance of democracy unless this word is used as a synonym for self government _meta_end_dot_

 i could go on but the point is that while we can quibble over the content of the ideas in the american identity i do much more than quibble with anyone who would present ideas as the primary or even only important aspect of that identity _meta_end_dot_

 with them my attitude must be opposition firm and consistent and my feeling must be distress at their seductive folly of their theory of patriotism _meta_end_dot_
