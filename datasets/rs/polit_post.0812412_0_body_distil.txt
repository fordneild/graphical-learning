  for the past eleven years the labour party dominated the political landscape in great britain _meta_end_dot_

 and now _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 things are different david cameron and my fondest hope is that he wounds gordon brown without being able to become prime minister himself perhaps that way the tories will opt for william hague my favorite candidate as a future tory leader to reclaim his leadership position and potentially become prime minister hague is currently the shadow foreign secretary _meta_end_dot_

 but it is increasingly looking as if cameron will indeed succeed brown the next time a general election is called _meta_end_dot_

 fate is fickle to be sure and at the beginning of his premiership brown looked unassailable _meta_end_dot_

 perhaps he will regain his momentum _meta_end_dot_

 but ever since backing away from calling a snap election last year and then claiming fatuously that labour could have won the election if so why didn t labour call the election brown has been all thumbs politically _meta_end_dot_

 his party has suffered accordingly _meta_end_dot_

 and one day after may day the fact that red ken livingstone has lost the mayoralty of london is nothing short of delightful _meta_end_dot_

 ah schadenfreude _meta_end_dot_
