  andrew biggs reveals that when it comes to tax policy barack obama has got some splainin to do read on _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 the culprit is bracket creep income tax brackets have not adjusted for the growth in earnings which means that if the bush tax cuts are indeed rolled back yet _meta_end_dot_

 perhaps we can get by on weak growth for a while before the economy finally picks up and avoid actual contractions _meta_end_dot_

 but if taxes are raised so dramatically the economic pinch we have sought to avoid will finally arrive _meta_end_dot_

 i should emphasize another portion of biggs s editorial even if the current tax cuts remain in place bracket creep will cause taxes to rise _meta_end_dot_

 anti tax cutters like to deride small government free market advocates for championing tax cuts at what the anti tax cutters believe is a pavlovian level _meta_end_dot_

 if they actually understood anything about bracket creep however they d quit with the derision _meta_end_dot_
