  for those of you whose first exposure to obama senior foreign policy adviser samantha power is her foolish insults to ohio and hillary clinton discussed by moe below you have some catching up to do but fortunately paul mirengoff at powerline has been on the case for months _meta_end_dot_

 mirengoff has laid out his case that power to an even greater extent than some of obama s other key advisers is anti israel and buys into the walt mearsheimer line that u s _meta_end_dot_

 policy in general and iraq policy in particular is under the nefarious influence of special interests mainly the israel lobby here here here here here here here here and here _meta_end_dot_

 key quote from power of course this sort of paranoia should not surprise observers of obama given where obama himself in his celebrated _meta_number_ref_ war speech placed the blame for the decision to go to war read on gee why specifically perle and wolfowitz and not say cheney and rumsfeld _meta_end_question_

 i think i know and i think you do too _meta_end_dot_

 obama knew his audience that day _meta_end_dot_

 but in fairness to obama he did argue that the iraq war wasn t just a conspiracy of jews but also a political plot by karl rove to distract us from the great depression of _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 that s a theme obama has echoed elsewhere albeit cannily shifting the blame for this sort of rhetoric to his constituents but never fear _meta_end_dot_

 barack obama isn t divisive just ask him _meta_end_dot_

 barack obama doesn t demonize his opponents just ask him _meta_end_dot_

 barack obama doesn t feed resentment and paranoia just ask him _meta_end_dot_

 but don t listen too closely to him or his advisers _meta_end_dot_
