  please excuse the piling on i know erick already posted on this but i am still compelled to add my two cents _meta_end_dot_

 dana milbank continues the washington post s campaign against doug feith s new book war and decision inside the pentagon at the dawn of the war on terrorism _meta_end_dot_

 the paper s effort to diminish feith s book began two weeks ago when thomas e _meta_end_dot_

 ricks and karen deyoung wrote a hit piece on feith s book without waiting for the book to be released or bothering taking the time to read the unedited manuscript of an embargoed book of some _meta_number_ref_ pages less than six hours before they managed to obtain less than six hours before they went to press _meta_end_dot_

 ricks and deyoung forget to mention that they both have books being sold books which take a bit of a different view of things than the three post writers versions of what is contained in feith s book _meta_end_dot_

 i feel at least as qualified as deyoung milbank or ricks to write about feith s new book _meta_end_dot_

 even though like the three of them i have not yet read war and decision _meta_end_dot_

 at least i took the time to talk to feith about the book and his experiences before writing this _meta_end_dot_

 earlier today i was fortunate enough to participate in a conference call with doug feith and other bloggers including some redstate colleagues _meta_end_dot_

 as pejman yousefzadeh posted we engaged in an interesting hour long discussion about the book _meta_end_dot_

 read on there is more _meta_end_dot_

 one of my colleagues attended the book launch event the center for strategic and international studies csis held for war and decision last night _meta_end_dot_

 like feith my colleague reported that mibank s article bore little resemblance to what actually occurred during the book launch _meta_end_dot_

 you don t have to take their word for it or my representations about what they said _meta_end_dot_

 csis has posted a video or if you prefer an audio file of the event so even though you weren t there you can watch or listen to the event and draw your own conclusion _meta_end_dot_

 as for millbank s article just note that reviewers who have actually read war and decision give it high praise at the national review larry di rita calls it a reference publication at the wall street journal bret stephens liked feith s book for its myth busting washington times columnist frank j _meta_end_dot_

 gaffney jr _meta_end_dot_

 calls the book extraordinary as mentioned in larry di rita s review feith has also set up a companion website to the book where you can access copies of many of the documents referred to in his book _meta_end_dot_

 i plan to read war and decision _meta_end_dot_

 how about you _meta_end_question_
