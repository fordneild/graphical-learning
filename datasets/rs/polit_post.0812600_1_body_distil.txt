  but even rasmussen has picked up the shift away from rs and toward ds over the past two year _meta_end_dot_

 the monthly survey found in april _meta_number_ref_ ds outnumber rs by _meta_number_ref_ _meta_percent_ref_ in _meta_number_ref_ it was by _meta_number_ref_ _meta_percent_ref_ and in _meta_number_ref_ it was _meta_number_ref_ _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 for perspective in november _meta_number_ref_ the d lead was only _meta_number_ref_ _meta_percent_ref_ and in november _meta_number_ref_ it was _meta_number_ref_ _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 so right now rs are just as numerous as election day _meta_number_ref_ but democrats have added _meta_percent_ref_ to their numbers _meta_end_dot_

 this is the worst relative showing since rasmussen started taking monthly samples in jan _meta_number_ref_ beating out the last two months which were d _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ and d _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 feb march and april _meta_number_ref_ have been the worst months for rs compared to ds in the _meta_number_ref_ year history of this poll _meta_end_dot_

 sen _meta_end_dot_

 mccain may be able to pull out a win by winning over sufficient i and d voters but the house and senate will become increasingly democrat if a ten point party id differential persists _meta_end_dot_

 republican leadership seems silent on the deteriorating position of the party _meta_end_dot_

 and there is not much effort to identify policies and ideals that will bring people to the party _meta_end_dot_
