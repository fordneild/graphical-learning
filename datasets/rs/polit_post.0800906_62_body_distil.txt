  in the coming weeks or months depending on how many kindly give to the effort we will with no doubt be launching red state version _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 we can and we will _meta_end_dot_

 you know those teaser screenshots of erick s _meta_end_question_

 those are not mockups _meta_end_dot_

 they are from a real live functioning development site we have up _meta_end_dot_

 it s just not done and we need to get it done _meta_end_dot_

 the new site is so close i m excited _meta_end_dot_

 i m grinning from ear to ear _meta_end_dot_

 i m not hyped up for any of the reasons that generally get talked about at length though _meta_end_dot_

 in a sense i think the coming transition is emblematic of a greater change for the better coming to red state _meta_end_dot_

 read on _meta_end_dot_

 since its founding red state has been great at two things community and commentary _meta_end_dot_

 however the one thing we ve never consistently done is make the step toward activism _meta_end_dot_

 yes we ve had some fundraising success helping egland drive out doolittle comes to mind immediately but in my time here the site has never been focused on going out and effecting change _meta_end_dot_

 i believe there is a reason for this our software has not matched our proper model _meta_end_dot_

 by using first the software of daily kos and then a one size fits all package made for ease on the installer we forced ourselves and the whole community to try to conform to the software and the activism here suffered _meta_end_dot_

 the scoop model works great at daily kos because of the nature of their ideology _meta_end_dot_

 they are the left _meta_end_dot_

 they are levelers they are equalizers they seek to bulldoze all natural distinctions to force everyone into some marxist utopian mush _meta_end_dot_

 we though have what russell kirk praised as the diversity appreciated by the conservatives _meta_end_dot_

 we live in different places we have different priorities and we have different needs for activism success _meta_end_dot_

 further we have loyalties to established order when the institutions have proven themselves we re not crashing gates and formenting revolution _meta_end_dot_

 red state _meta_number_ref_ will give our wonderful community the opportunity to go in this new direction we need _meta_end_dot_

 using other peoples software and trying to use other movements models has not worked but going our own way once and for all will let us find our own republican model of activism _meta_end_dot_

 i find this idea deeply exciting and that is why i am committed to seeing it through _meta_end_dot_

 i want it done and fortunately i have ten years experience in website front end and back end development to make it useful _meta_end_dot_

 erick knows this too and our efforts are being scheduled accordingly _meta_end_dot_

 the money given to the effort by eagle and by our readers will be spent wisely _meta_end_dot_

 it first goes to getting the system in a functional state such that we can get it launched and so that i can begin doing the extra work that needs done to give red state the functionality and polish we need and you want to ensure our community is not held back _meta_end_dot_

 this way the things i can do for us for free can be done for free _meta_end_dot_

 i m committed determined and have big goals _meta_end_dot_

 we all do and the action mailing list is only the first step _meta_end_dot_

 please join us _meta_end_dot_

 your donation will have the deep gratitude of all of us here at red state _meta_end_dot_
