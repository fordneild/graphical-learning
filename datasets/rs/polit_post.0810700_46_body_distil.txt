  the morning began like almost any other on the campus of virginia polytechnic institute and state university home of the hokies _meta_end_dot_

 students got up went to breakfast went to class or went out for the day blissfully unaware of the fact that within mere hours of the start of their day the worst tragedy ever to strike an american institute of higher education would take place on those very grounds with the slaughter of _meta_number_ref_ individuals by a single murderous student _meta_end_dot_

 cho seung hui a _meta_number_ref_ year old resident alien from south korea who had lived in the united states for nearly fifteen years apparently awoke that fateful monday morning with one singular purpose in mind to ensure that this day decided by himself to be his last on earth would also be the last day of life for as many others as he could possibly make it _meta_end_dot_

 read on _meta_end_dot_

 his killing spree began in a dormitory where at _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ am he gunned down an _meta_number_ref_ year old girl and a _meta_number_ref_ year old young man _meta_end_dot_

 once the incident had been reported the dorm was locked down and then the lockdown was inexplicably lifted with no progress having been made at finding the two students murder the university police believed without any evidence whatsoever that he had left campus _meta_end_dot_

 further other than a cursory uninformative email sent well after the fact no effort was made to notify students of that double homicide _meta_end_dot_

 due in part to these mistakes the two killed in the dormitory would just be the first of dozens slaughtered that morning _meta_end_dot_

 two hours later cho crossed the campus entered an engineering building chained the doors of the building shut from the inside and proceeded to empty clip after clip of _meta_number_ref_mm and _meta_number_ref_ caliber ammunition into the students who filled the crowded classrooms firing through doors lining students up against the wall and executing them one by one and aiming for anybody he could find in the hallways or in the rooms _meta_end_dot_

 students were reduced to barricading doors with desks playing dead and even jumping out of third and fourth story windows to escape the scene of massive carnage with their lives intact _meta_end_dot_

 what those who managed to escape left behind was a bloodbath _meta_end_dot_

 when all was said and done over sixty people were injured and when all was said and done over thirty were dead including the killer himself _meta_end_dot_

 neither the campus police nor the administration deserve full blame for the massacre _meta_end_dot_

 while both are tasked with protecting the welfare and ensuring the safety of virginia tech s student body none could have imagined a murderous rampage of this magnitude in their wildest dreams let alone adequately prepared for and reacted properly to such an event _meta_end_dot_

 the very idea of such senseless killing is impossible to comprehend for the vast majority of people in part this is why so many in the west refuse to or simply cannot comprehend the irrationally unquenchably murderous nature of our islamist enemy in the war on terror _meta_end_dot_

 what could have driven a young man to such lengths that he turned to the vicious slaughter of his fellow humans as an outlet _meta_end_question_

 we will likely never know however the content of the note cho left behind and information from classmates and teachers combine to paint the picture of an exceptionally troubled young man who was alone unhappy and likely unstable in short a young man who displayed virtually all of the warning signs one would look for if trying to identify a potential perpetrator of such a vicious act _meta_end_dot_

 the fact that little or no action was taken to intervene in cho s life before he committed this massacre will and should cause endless second guessing for years to come both of the university s faculty and of the student support system in place at virginia tech _meta_end_dot_

 however the most important action that can now be taken is to continue seeking to prevent such a tragedy taking place in the future _meta_end_dot_

 the grief felt by the families of these students professors fathers sons daughters brothers sisters and friends was impossible to measure or to put into words _meta_end_dot_

 as nikki giovanni a university distinguished professor at virginia tech said we are sad today and we will be sad for quite a while _meta_end_dot_

 we are not moving on _meta_end_dot_

 we are embracing our mourning her later comparison of the students slaughtered that day to baby elephants killed by hunters was exceedingly pathetic and insulting but her aforementioned phrase was well put at the time _meta_end_dot_

 those involved experienced so many different thoughts feelings and reactions and those experiences did not stop for them like they did for so many of us when a brief time had passed and the massacre had left the _meta_number_ref_ hour news cycle _meta_end_dot_

 how can people respond to such an unthinkable atrocity to the act of such reckless hate _meta_end_question_

 how can they cope with the senseless snuffing out of the life of a family member or a loved one who had until that fateful moment simply been going about their normal life _meta_end_question_

 many of us on the outside experienced our own forms of sorrow rage and disgust in response to this tragic event _meta_end_dot_

 debates over gun control were re ignited with special attention being paid to a bill vo_meta_number_ref_ted down in the virginia state house of representatives which would have allowed students and employees to carry registered handguns on campus _meta_end_dot_

 a virginia tech spokesman praised the negative outcome at the time saying that the bill s defeat would help parents students faculty and visitors feel safe on our campus on the contrary i do not wish to enter into a debate on gun control and the second amendment here at this time and in this place but had the bill passed and even one student in that building been carrying a weapon on their person how many lives could have been saved and if the answer was one would that have been too few _meta_end_question_

 pundits politicians and commentators offered their own observations on the situation at the time _meta_end_dot_

 on espn radio s dan patrick show baseball commentator and hall of fame player joe morgan lamented that since this did not take place during football or basketball season the students will regrettably be forced to heal on alone and then had the audacity to compare this massacre of over thirty innocent men and women to the don imus scandal of the week before _meta_end_dot_

 this latter sentiment was echoed by democrat presidential candidate barack obama who directly compared monday s physical violence at virginia tech to the verbal violence of the since fired radio shock jock of course mr _meta_end_dot_

 obama had no problem making excuses for the remarks of his pastor who called on god to damn america and spent twenty years cursing the white man and the us in his church to a willingly listening obama however a far less calculated and intentioned comment like imus s was somehow the same as this slaughter to the perpetually muddle minded obama _meta_end_dot_

 the aforementioned nikki giovanni s address at the vigil included the following statement people to baby elephants or the equation of the senseless loss of life to the offending of sensibilities _meta_end_dot_

 only in a society as soft and as comfortable as ours has become could such comparisons be straightfacedly drawn _meta_end_dot_

 the fact that such statements could be made are almost assuredly a sign of one of two things _meta_number_ref_ we have solved every one of our real problems and are relegated to comparing hurt feelings and politically convenient statements to actual murder or _meta_number_ref_ we have buried our real problems so deeply for the purpose of focusing on petty little issues like hurt feelings and political correctness that cho s act was simply a single vent of warning about the geyser if not volcano on which so many petty pathetically weak personalities in our society are currently sitting _meta_end_dot_

 not all of the disparate developments and responses provoked by this tragedy were negative though _meta_end_dot_

 for all too brief a time the virginia tech family was brought together albeit thirty three people short in a way that only tragedy could have accomplish _meta_end_dot_

 ordinary people going about their ordinary lives with ordinary quibbles complaints and trials had their lives forcibly put into perspective and those in this nation who did not fall prey to the inexplicable and inexcusable urge to view slaughtered people in the same light as hunted animals or hurt feelings were made aware once again how precious life is and how quickly and pointlessly it could be stuffed out _meta_end_dot_

 from the ashes of such a horrific series of events arose tales of unimaginable heroism such as that displayed by professor liviu librescu a holocaust survivor and migr from romania who used his body to bar cho from entering the door to his classroom while being shot so as to give his students an opportunity to save their own lives by exiting through the windows _meta_end_dot_

 as powerline com s paul mirengoff so aptly put it at the time more than sixty years after the holocaust survivor s liberation the rescued became the rescuer paul continued one fact remains above all others a person never knows how they will react to a given situation until they have been placed in it and those who have not been in such a horrifying gruesome situation as those students at virginia tech faced monday morning should be very slow indeed to judge the actions of those who were there _meta_end_dot_

 we all hope that we would react like professor librescu did however as a commenter at redstate com put it great people do great things _meta_end_dot_

 i like to say that in a moment of terror like that i would do the same thing but in my heart i don t know if i would have the courage human nature being what it is i have a hard time believing that many of those people who made it through the ordeal while their classmates were perishing around them will not spend at least part of every day for the rest of their lives reliving rethinking and second guessing the events of that morning and their corresponding actions and wondering if there was anything they could have done differently or could have done at all which though it would have placed them at even greater risk might have saved the life of even one of their fellows _meta_end_dot_

 i know that i would _meta_end_dot_

 every day _meta_end_dot_

 so let us keep in our thoughts prayers and memories those who were lost and those whom they left behind commit to remembering this tragedy and the lessons it teaches us _meta_end_dot_

 rather than stepping onto a soapbox and beating a political drum a far more productive response to this event would be to continue following the lead of a virginia tech student present at the scene of the killings who wrote an email to his family in which he recounted the story told him amidst the events of the morning of her own ordeal when she looked out into the hallway of the building where the murders were taking place and came face to face with cho _meta_end_dot_

 that this student who saw the carnage himself who lost friends colleagues and acquaintances and who had his life changed forever by events out of his control can approach the aftermath of this event with such maturity serenity perspective and forgiveness should send a strong clear signal to us all _meta_end_dot_

 using this anniversary to push pet petty and pathetic political causes is absolutely and inarguably the wrong thing to do _meta_end_dot_

 at miami university of ohio a professor and students in his men s health class are asking male students to paint their fingernails red today as a means of rais ing awareness about senseless violence committed by men excuse me _meta_end_question_

 this goes back to the two option diagnosis i presented above _meta_end_dot_

 are we really _meta_number_ref_ so devoid of real problems or _meta_number_ref_ so repressed as a society that we can take an anniversary such as this of an event which should have served as a wake up call to a nation about a threat and the existence and pervasiveness of a mindset such as cho s and use it to try to make a pathetically invalid point about blood on all men s hands while simultaneously using that symbol in the form of fingernail polish to encourage the feminization of the masculine half of our society _meta_end_question_

 those of us with a modicum of perspective who are even minimally in touch with reality can do better than this _meta_end_dot_

 we can use this aniversary and remember this event in such a way as to learn from it and to rededicate ourselves to the safety and righteousness of our people and of our society _meta_end_dot_

 so let us never forget the events of this tragic morning in april _meta_number_ref_ and let us come together as a stronger community and strive to be better stronger individuals as a result _meta_end_dot_
