  we re hearing that barack obama is starting to talk about economic matters _meta_end_dot_

 this is going to be fun for us here at redstate because not only is the greenhorn illinois senator a lightweight he s also not aware that he s a lightweight _meta_end_dot_

 so he s started saying that we re having a recession because of income inequality _meta_end_dot_

 well no senator _meta_end_dot_

 we re having a recession because of problems in the global credit markets _meta_end_dot_

 as a result of aggressive rate cutting by the federal reserve there is significant evidence that the credit crunch is easing in a narrow set of markets most particularly the short term interbank lending market _meta_end_dot_

 however credit spreads for corporate finance have begun to increase in recent days which is not a good sign _meta_end_dot_

 and as this story points out some sectors of the public finance market are showing major distress _meta_end_dot_

 some of the state and local agencies that finance everything from student loan subsidies to transportation infrastructure are having a lot of trouble getting investors to buy their bonds _meta_end_dot_

 and the banks that usually underwrite these issues are refusing to support them _meta_end_dot_

 read more _meta_end_dot_

 when we say government we often mean the federal government which spends somewhat more than _meta_percent_ref_ of our gdp _meta_end_dot_

 but america also has thousands of non national tax and spend powers ranging from the fifty states down to your local dog catcher authority _meta_end_dot_

 add them to the feds and you get a total government burden on gdp approaching _meta_percent_ref_ not much lower than in france _meta_end_dot_

 local governments fund their activities with a combination of current revenue and long term financing just as businesses and households do _meta_end_dot_

 and there s a well established dynamic that occurs in non federal public finance when the general economy rises and falls _meta_end_dot_

 localities don t have the practically infinite credit quality of the federal government _meta_end_dot_

 in times of strong economic growth state and local politicians spend our money like drunken sailors buying up all the patronage and political influence they can _meta_end_dot_

 but when the economy slows and tax revenues dry up they get squeezed hard _meta_end_dot_

 right on cue that s happening now _meta_end_dot_

 the specific thing i wanted to point out to you this morning relates to public bonds whose prices are set in periodic auctions _meta_end_dot_

 bond issues of all kinds are usually illiquid _meta_end_dot_

 on the run us treasury debt is one of the exceptions of course but for municipal and state bonds there generally is not a well structured secondary market where you can trade your bonds at well known market prices _meta_end_dot_

 and of course this illiquidity makes it harder to find buyers for public debt and tends to raise interest costs for the taxpayers who ultimately support the debt _meta_end_dot_

 there are many techniques that states and cities use to enhance the quality and lower the price of their debt _meta_end_dot_

 one of them is called auction bidding an auction bid bond issue resets the interest rate that it pays every month or so pursuant to an auction that is generally run by a large bank or wall street broker dealer think citigroup or goldman sachs _meta_end_dot_

 the periodic auctions in effect provide a secondary market for people who hold a particular issue of public debt and want to sell it _meta_end_dot_

 the auction collects bids from other buyers and if everyone agrees to the interest rates determined by the auction the bonds change hands and start paying the new interest rate _meta_end_dot_

 this is a pretty clever way to enhance the liquidity of public issues and generally helps to make public finance cheaper _meta_end_dot_

 what happens when there aren t enough bidders to clear the market _meta_end_question_

 well in the past the bank or broker dealer running the auction has generally stood ready to bid in the auction and in effect underwrite the security _meta_end_dot_

 in many cases in recent days this has stopped happening _meta_end_dot_

 why _meta_end_question_

 because banks can t or won t take on any new balance sheet debt _meta_end_dot_

 they re reluctant to do the very thing they re in business to do which is to extend credit _meta_end_dot_

 what happens then _meta_end_question_

 well auction bid bonds generally have a convenant in their terms of offering that stipulates a particular rate of interest to be paid to bondholders who can t sell in a failed auction _meta_end_dot_

 in some recent cases this rate is _meta_percent_ref_ a number that you re likely to hear in msm scare stories about this situation _meta_end_dot_

 reluctance to lend is the essence of the credit crunch i keep talking about and now you can see the effects _meta_end_dot_

 business corporations and now public entities are having a great deal of trouble obtaining funding for their activities _meta_end_dot_

 inability to obtain credit is the surest precursor of slower economic growth and ultimately recessions _meta_end_dot_

 in the case of failed auctions there is also a more direct contractive effect _meta_end_dot_

 since the monthly auctions function as a secondary market for municipal bonds it s possible for business corporations to purchase these securities for short periods of time _meta_end_dot_

 this is good of course because it adds another source of liquidity _meta_end_dot_

 but when auctions fail the corporate buyers of muni bonds can t get out of them _meta_end_dot_

 that leaves their capital tied up and unavailable for expanding their businesses _meta_end_dot_

 it s well worth noting the role of municipal bond insurers in all this _meta_end_dot_

 there is a small number of companies much in the news lately that sell insurance policies to municipal bond buyers in effect guaranteeing the credit quality of the issues _meta_end_dot_

 you ve heard of ambac mbia and fgic _meta_end_dot_

 in a standard structured finance technique they lend their high credit ratings to the securities that they insure taking an insurance premium in return _meta_end_dot_

 the bond insurers were among the most profitable companies anywhere for years until now _meta_end_dot_

 since several of them branched out into insuring mortgage backed securities they no longer have top credit ratings _meta_end_dot_

 and as a result all of the securities they ve insured can no longer be considered fully insured _meta_end_dot_

 you can imagine what happens then more and more waves of distress selling by investors who are not allowed to own debt below a certain rating _meta_end_dot_

 i can give you one important signal that the bond insurance business has been and will again be an awfully good one warren buffett the noted value investor has offered to re insure a lot of the debt now covered by ambac mbia and others _meta_end_dot_

 they of course would like to stay independent and work their problems out on their own _meta_end_dot_

 if they bite off on buffett s proposal he ll make out like a bandit _meta_end_dot_

 what s the federal government going to do about all this _meta_end_question_

 well naturally they will want to use your money to make life easier for the states and cities that they force to fund medicare medicaid and a range of education mandates _meta_end_dot_

 such relief already appeared in both senator clinton s and senator obama s strawman economic stimulus packages last month but not in the legislation that actually passed _meta_end_dot_

 expect more of this idea to come however _meta_end_dot_

 obama is already talking about federalizing the funding of transportation and other infrastructure the famous roads and bridges to _meta_end_dot_

 well one hopes to somewhere _meta_end_dot_
