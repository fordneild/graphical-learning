  we re so busy focused on the presidential race we ve ignored steve pearce out in new mexico _meta_end_dot_

 he ran against heather wilson in the gop primary to replace pete domenici _meta_end_dot_

 in the last days of the campaign domenici endorsed heather wilson _meta_end_dot_

 it did her no good _meta_end_dot_

 pearce ran as the conservative in the race and won _meta_end_dot_

 he ll now face tom udall _meta_end_dot_

 according to the rcp average it is going to be a very uphill race _meta_end_dot_

 with all of new mexico in play this year we really need to turn the spotlight on the state and try to help where we can _meta_end_dot_
