  not that readers should be surprised anymore but i find myself gobsmacked by this post from andrew sullivan _meta_end_dot_

 whence comes the revelation that mccain wants us to withdraw as much as obama _meta_end_question_

 mccain certainly wants iraq to be able to govern itself but he does not want to withdraw in the same way that obama says he does _meta_end_dot_

 mccain knows that the surge is working _meta_end_dot_

 obama likely does as well but obama also knows that admitting that the surge is working will kill him with the democratic base _meta_end_dot_

 thus yet another reality based politician will seek to deny reality _meta_end_dot_

 as evidently will a reality based blogger in sullivan _meta_end_dot_

 oh and if sullivan doesn t know that upon a precipitous american withdrawal al qaeda will consolidate itself in an anarchic iraq and use it as a staging ground for the next terrifying attack on the united states and on american interests think afghanistan in the run up to _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ andrew _meta_end_dot_

 surely you remember back that far then there is nothing i can do to help him _meta_end_dot_

 of course credit where it is due this from sullivan is really quite the funny aside _meta_end_dot_
