 dan boren d ok will not endorse barack obama _meta_end_dot_

 why _meta_end_question_

 he says obama is too liberal _meta_end_dot_

 in fact he told the associated press that obama was the most liberal senator and he wanted to respect the wishes of his constituents _meta_end_dot_

 of course he ll vote for obama but at least he respects his conservative constituents _meta_end_dot_

 contrast that behavior with nick lampson tx _meta_number_ref_ the most endangered democrat in congress _meta_end_dot_

 he s all aboard the obama train _meta_end_dot_

 he does not really care about his constituents _meta_end_dot_

 lampson just wants to stay in washington _meta_end_dot_

 update by moe lane i would also like to note this post specifically the update by jake tapper _meta_end_dot_

 while i understand the need to push back on potentially embarrassing statements made by others it s just a little odd that the obama campaign feels the need to do it to those on obama s own side _meta_end_dot_

 particularly now that he s been declared the nominee and everything _meta_end_dot_
