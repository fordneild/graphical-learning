  for the this primary is made out of awesome files via the huffington post we see that moveon org is absolutely adamant that senator obama filibuster the fisa bill this week _meta_end_dot_

 how awesome is it _meta_end_question_

 it s awesome enough that i m reprinting the whole post after the fold _meta_end_dot_

 that s how awesome it is _meta_end_dot_

 you see i want progressives to email the senator and demand that he filibuster he ll either not do so and thus betray them further or he ll cave to them which will embarrass the democratic party at the very moment that they need to show unity _meta_end_dot_

 and either way the fisa bill still passes _meta_end_dot_

 that s because the progressives don t have the votes to stop it even if harry reid wasn t owned by mitch mcconnell who looks increasingly likely to be keeping his seat after all _meta_end_dot_

 as he is _meta_end_dot_

 well _meta_end_dot_

 this should be entertaining _meta_end_dot_

 well _meta_end_dot_

 at least for people who you know matter _meta_end_dot_
