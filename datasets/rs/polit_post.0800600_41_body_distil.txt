  the republicans have been going at it for the past hour in new hampshire on abc _meta_end_dot_

 how s your guy doing _meta_end_question_

 discuss it here _meta_end_dot_

 update and it s over _meta_end_dot_

 quick reactions romney took a big hit _meta_end_dot_

 he looked desperate and flailing _meta_end_dot_

 mccain was a little subdued and fell to the temptation to kick romney while he was down _meta_end_dot_

 if only fred thompson had as much energy as he has gravitas _meta_end_dot_

 he needed to be a bit more aggressive _meta_end_dot_

 giuliani was characteristically solid _meta_end_dot_

 huckabee managed to get through it without really saying much of anything _meta_end_dot_

 and then there was paul _meta_end_dot_

 my guess is that mccain and giuliani go up romney and huckabee go down and thompson stays the same _meta_end_dot_
