  comes now the latest insanity via hot air from former sentient being and romney advisor douglas kmiec who would like to tell us all how obama is better than mccain on abortion _meta_end_dot_

 by way of reminder when kmiec originally decided to endorse obama our own pejman yousefzadeh took him to task which provoked the following response from kmiec on the abortion question apparently after having basked in the glow of his obamaness for a week or two kmiec has decided to recant _meta_end_dot_

 not only is obama not unsatisfactory on abortion he is more satisfactory than reagan mccain or either of the bushes _meta_end_exclamation_

 more below _meta_end_dot_

 i was tempted to cut and paste long sections of kmiec s piece and dissect them here for you all to see but i m afraid it s neither worth my effort nor your time _meta_end_dot_

 you see kmiec merely trots out every tired canard that has ever been used by any earnest democrat or pro choicer who has desired to assuage the consciences of sincere catholics _meta_end_dot_

 obama feels your pain _meta_end_dot_

 obama understands this is a hard decision _meta_end_dot_

 obama supports birth control which is the only real way to curb abortions you reactionary jesus freak _meta_end_dot_

 and on and on and on and i just can t bring myself to read all the way to the end of this particular book again and i certainly don t want to subject you all dear readers to the same old arguments again and again _meta_end_dot_

 i have extensive archives here at redstate on this topic for those who care to read them _meta_end_dot_

 i have but a few brief observations that apply to kmiec personally that i shall share with you all _meta_end_dot_

 first if he really believes the tripe he is now peddling then he never had any business supporting romney _meta_end_dot_

 he should have instead supported rudy _meta_end_dot_

 this was as you may recall the defining difference between the two men s approach on abortion which has heretofore been one of kmiec s signature issues _meta_end_dot_

 the remaining differences between rudy and romney dealt almost exclusively with their personal rather than policy traits _meta_end_dot_

 and if a guy like kmiec really thought the rudy approach to abortion was superior then i haven t the foggiest why he wasn t a rudy supporter _meta_end_dot_

 second kmiec used to be a sharp enough guy to recognize the fallacy of the false dilemma when he saw it _meta_end_dot_

 supporting judges who want to overturn roe v _meta_end_dot_

 wade doesn t mean you can t also support things like birth control education and parishioners talking to their pastors _meta_end_dot_

 kmiec offers no evidence whatsoever that mccain is against the widespread availability of birth control or all the other things that allegedly make obama s approach on abortion better _meta_end_dot_

 kmiec s argument on this point really boils down to nothing more substantive than barack obama looks a lot more handsome and convincing when he bites his lower lip and tells women that he feels their pain well i suppose that may be true but i haven t the foggiest why it should sway a man who makes a living by allegedly thinking and writing seriously about legal issues _meta_end_dot_

 third how in the world does a guy like kmiec who himself recognizes in the piece i above linked that the very notion of abortion is incompatible with enlightened conceptions of personhood and basic human rights not understand the moral disrepute that the existence of roe v _meta_end_dot_

 wade brings upon this country _meta_end_question_

 it has been argued i express no personal opinion on the matter that even if the civil war had not been fought slavery in america would have ended prior to world war i _meta_end_dot_

 let us posit a world then in which there never was a civil war yet here in _meta_number_ref_ the institution of slavery has peacably passed out of existence its existence being justly repudiated by society as a whole _meta_end_dot_

 does kmiec suppose that it would have offered no value along the way for either the courts or congress to have passed some constitutional amendment or statute expressly repudiating the dred scott decision _meta_end_question_

 would he today support a man who stood up and forthrightly declared that he supported the legal institution of slavery provided that the same man very sincerely considered it to be a tough moral choice _meta_end_question_

 of course no morally serious person would support such a candidate _meta_end_dot_

 and douglas kmiec used to be a morally serious person _meta_end_dot_

 but now one reads through his writings searching in vain for anything approaching serious moral reasoning that begins from valid premises and ends with sound conclusions _meta_end_dot_

 instead we are treated to andrew sullivan esque analysis that leaves one with the feeling that the analyst is not describing a person but rather a siren whose bewitching song has robbed the analyst of his reasoning faculties _meta_end_dot_

 kmiec used to be better than this _meta_end_dot_

 and he still professes to understand the great evil that abortion represents _meta_end_dot_

 sadly he has decided to actively pursue a course which demonstrates that his judgment has utterly betrayed him _meta_end_dot_

 it is thus somewhat apropos to find him in the camp of the man whose only claim to competence for the job to which he aspires is his own flawed judgment _meta_end_dot_

 it would appear that kmiec and obama have been peas in a pod all along _meta_end_dot_
