  but then sen _meta_end_dot_

 mccain stole the thunder away from his own political jujitsu by coming out in favor of a cap and trade system for carbon emissions _meta_end_dot_

 leaving aside the catastrophic economic implications such a policy would have and sidestepping the question of whether man made global warming is real and reversible calling for this policy on the heels of proposing a gas tax suspension is both bad politics and poor message craft _meta_end_dot_

 the two proposals contradict one another and make the democrats message look coherent by comparison _meta_end_dot_

 read on suspending the gas tax would in theory make gas more affordable which in theory would lead to more driving more pollution and more warming _meta_end_dot_

 but mccain s cap and trade system proposal is predicated on the premise that carbon emissions are bad _meta_end_dot_

 if mccain is as concerned about doing something to combat global warming as he claims shouldn t he be happy with high gas prices _meta_end_question_

 they at least keep people from driving or if not they encourage people to drive more fuel efficient cars _meta_end_dot_

 how does making gas more affordable even for the short run of the summer make the transition to alternative fuels and alternative vehicles in the long run more likely _meta_end_question_

 these are questions of the candidate s own making _meta_end_dot_

 on the strategy side mccain s call for seemingly contradictory policies on gas prices and the environment negates any advantage he gained for himself politically _meta_end_dot_

 with his call for cap and trade mccain policy positions become indistinguishable from hillary clinton s _meta_end_dot_

 worse mccain s positions actually make barack obama s cap and trade no gas tax holiday look more well thought out and principled _meta_end_dot_

 at least obama acknowledges that a gas tax holiday would contribute to increased driving which he views as bad _meta_end_dot_

 the lesson here is that pandering is not without its price _meta_end_dot_

 on both issues mccain is proposing solutions designed not so much to solve a problem for the long term but to win votes in the short term _meta_end_dot_

 that s politics and we can accept it to a degree _meta_end_dot_

 but when candidates begin to pander wildly and without regard to their own previous pandering it detracts from the campaign s overall message _meta_end_dot_

 in trying to prove his eco friendliness to moderate and independent voters mccain has successfully polluted his own message _meta_end_dot_
