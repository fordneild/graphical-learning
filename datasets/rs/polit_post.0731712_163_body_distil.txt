 today s one of those days where opinions on the news are bound to run the gamut _meta_end_dot_

 often you ll get a news story that divides readers along partisan lines _meta_end_dot_

 a story about a new democrat tax hike in lansing will tick off the conservatives and it ll cause the left to cheer _meta_end_dot_

 but there s nothing that simple in today s headlines _meta_end_dot_

 instead there s nuance everywhere which is nice for a change _meta_end_dot_

 or is it _meta_end_question_

 i guess it depends _meta_end_dot_

 lets start with what i d consider great news _meta_end_dot_

 quicken loans announced late yesterday that they ll be moving their corporate headquarters from the suburbs in metro detroit into the city itself _meta_end_dot_

 the detroit news has the details read on _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 well there was the time when that homeless guy tried to steal a coworker s car at gunpoint but c mon that was just an isolated incident _meta_end_dot_

 mix it all up and shake it all out and i love the d _meta_end_dot_

 i m thrilled to hear that quicken loans is going to go ahead and make the giant investment and commitment in the center of the city _meta_end_dot_

 a grand rapids native i know the power of a strong and vibrant center city _meta_end_dot_

 if you live here or have visited in the last decade you ve seen what i m talking about _meta_end_dot_

 this is one more step in that direction for detroit _meta_end_dot_

 they ve got a lot more to go but it s progress _meta_end_dot_

 now my friends on the left of the political spectrum find themselves in a precarious position this morning _meta_end_dot_

 they claim to love detroit and when they read the headlines proclaiming _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ jobs to detroit there are probably a half dozen or so who all but wet themselves anticipating the opportunity to talk about a little good news _meta_end_dot_

 then comes the money shot _meta_end_dot_

 literally _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_dollor_ref_ million in tax rebates and incentives from the state and the city _meta_end_dot_

 ouch _meta_end_dot_

 another company getting rich at the expense of the little guy no doubt _meta_end_dot_

 these days most on the left haven t met a tax incentive they didn t hate in public _meta_end_dot_

 and while they battle back and forth with that internal dialogue happy or sad thrilled or ticked to tax or not to tax the suburbs aren t happy _meta_end_dot_

 livonia isn t happy _meta_end_dot_

 they re going to lose a heck of a lot of tax revenue _meta_end_dot_

 quicken s other locations aren t happy _meta_end_dot_

 and you d better believe there are a lot of employees who aren t looking forward to the commute _meta_end_dot_

 south east michigan s union legacy workforce takes great pride in working hard enough to get the heck out of detroit and there s a palpable sentiment of relief when one s able to move and work away from the d _meta_end_dot_

 so much for that _meta_end_dot_

 another bout of good news bad news surrounding the idea of significant reform of the legislature itself _meta_end_dot_

 the associated press reports that an unnamed citizen group is preparing a petition drive to give the voters a chance to create a smaller part time legislature something that a lot of folks seem pretty keen on these days _meta_end_dot_

 the trick is it may be connected to a move that most reform the legislature advocates aren t quite as keen on these days _meta_end_dot_

 the ap this one s even got me dealing with conflicting emotions _meta_end_dot_

 i m personally not a fan of the part time legislature _meta_end_dot_

 don t get me wrong _meta_end_dot_

 i am a fan of smaller leaner more efficient government _meta_end_dot_

 of limited government action _meta_end_dot_

 of increased personal freedom _meta_end_dot_

 but as i ve argued before a move to a part time legislature and a greatly reduced salary will in essence make service in lansing something that s only attainable by the upper middle class and the wealthy _meta_end_dot_

 middle class blue collar folks simply won t be able to run _meta_end_dot_

 they just don t work the sort of jobs that you can pick up and leave for three months during the year and they wouldn t be able to afford it if they could _meta_end_dot_

 that said i d love to see term limits repealed _meta_end_dot_

 increase personal freedom _meta_end_dot_

 let us choose who we want to elect _meta_end_dot_

 and finally in today s ultimate example of good news bad news the state s this close to saving a boat load of cash on an expired expense but for every action there s an equal and opposite reaction _meta_end_dot_

 the freep reports that the southern michigan correctional facility in jackson will be shuttered on saturday _meta_end_dot_

 saving _meta_dollor_ref_ million is a good thing _meta_end_dot_

 transferring the jobs without killing them outright is a good thing _meta_end_dot_

 now the jackson area s going to hurt as a result but maybe a bigger issue is the fact that all of those prisoners were also transferred _meta_end_dot_

 to other facilities _meta_end_dot_

 while we continue to hear time and again from the administration that we ve got an overcrowding problem _meta_end_dot_

 government has a few explicit and necessary functions _meta_end_dot_

 law enforcement is one of them _meta_end_dot_

 without a mechanism to keep the bad guys off the streets this society would be in a pretty bad way _meta_end_dot_

 so this is where we cut dollars _meta_end_question_

 creating further overcrowding problems _meta_end_question_

 we can spend over _meta_dollor_ref_ million in the law and order fight on a new msp headquarters that msp doesn t want but we can t prevent over crowding _meta_end_question_

 we can grant unlimited welfare benefits to able bodied adults but we can t do better when it comes to locking up the bad guys _meta_end_question_

 we can increase the size and scope of state government while raising taxes by billions creating the largest budget in the history of the state but we need to close prisons _meta_end_question_

 i like streamlined government _meta_end_dot_

 i do _meta_end_dot_

 and this closure may even be something that needed to happen or was long overdue _meta_end_dot_

 but when we look at it in light of some of the governor s other spending priorities _meta_end_dot_

 well _meta_end_dot_

 someone s got their priorities out of whack br
