 i saw runaway spending poor fiscal management and lots of talk but no action i wanted to turn things around and bring about conservative change in _meta_number_ref_ i entered public life when i was elected to the board of supervisors of the northern palm beach county improvement district where i served as vice president in _meta_number_ref_ and _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_
