 if the right strategy is used by the republicans in this presidential election it will not matter which of the democrat pretenders is offered _meta_end_dot_

 it is important to know what the strategy cannot be _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ it cannot be an embrace of the democrats brand _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ it cannot be an embrace of the democrats talking points _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ it cannot be the democrats division by class _meta_end_dot_

 the democrat brand democrats by the very nature of their party must appeal to various interest groups _meta_end_dot_

 that cannot be done by being specific _meta_end_dot_

 thus change _meta_end_dot_

 republicans who embrace the change brand are not running for their election they are running to enhance the democrats brand _meta_end_dot_

 the democrat agenda democrats by the very nature of their party must appeal to various interest groups _meta_end_dot_

 that cannot be done by addressing issues that matter to a nation but only by issues that matter to those interest groups finding issues that are common to them _meta_end_dot_

 thus universal health care abortion and anti national security positions _meta_end_dot_

 each one appealing to a small collection of radical elements _meta_end_dot_

 the democrat talking points democrats by the very nature of their party must appeal to various interest groups _meta_end_dot_

 that cannot be done by being specific _meta_end_dot_

 talking points allow democrats to offer various social ills no matter how real they are or not and offer solutions to them that always involve direct imposition _meta_end_dot_

 thus the solution to the health care crisis which does not exist is single payer government controlled health insurance _meta_end_dot_

 the solution to the national security crisis which does exist is talking to the enemy which only makes the enemy equal the solution to the economic crisis which does not really exist it is mostly reactionary problems from scared people who believe the crisis line is putting money in the hands of anyone who has not contributed to the funds in the past _meta_end_dot_

 the democrat multiplicity of issues democrats by the very nature of their party must appeal to various interest groups _meta_end_dot_

 that cannot be done by being specific _meta_end_dot_

 the issues they do embrace are those that tug at the emotional reaction of voters who want something for nothing and they do it with clouds _meta_end_dot_

 thus change we can believe in hope and the ever elusive but always desired i m asking you to believe in yourself the democrat division by class democrats by the very nature of their party must appeal to various interest groups _meta_end_dot_

 that cannot be done by being specific _meta_end_dot_

 with democrats their base is wealthy power but they want you to think their base is the poor and the deprived _meta_end_dot_

 they talk about the rich as if being rich is a bad thing _meta_end_dot_

 they talk about the haves as if the have nots are a preferred class _meta_end_dot_

 they talk about the minorities as if being a minority should give one preference _meta_end_dot_

 they talk about gender as if one s gender means they should ignore their reasoning abilities _meta_end_dot_

 they pit the living against the unborn _meta_end_dot_

 they pit the poor against the rich _meta_end_dot_

 they pit those who want to love for peace against those who want to fight for it _meta_end_dot_

 democrats thrive on division democrats by the very nature of their party must appeal to various interest groups _meta_end_dot_

 that cannot be done by being specific _meta_end_dot_

 as luck would have it they are so divided it is easy to bring them together when their candidates appeal to the one thing all splinters of the democratic party have in common the appeal of government solving the ills they perceive are always someone else s fault _meta_end_dot_

 the right strategy must be _meta_number_ref_ simple single theme and its own brand _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ it must be the single answer to every democrat proposal _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ and it must be applicable to every issue the democrats raise _meta_end_dot_

 single theme just like the threat that faces the nation from abroad this is not an election about the right and the left it is an election about right and wrong _meta_end_dot_

 there are only two types of answers possible for every problem _meta_end_dot_

 the right answer and the wrong answer _meta_end_dot_

 there are many wrong answers _meta_end_dot_

 there is only one right answer _meta_end_dot_

 counter this as rudy guiliani pointed out there is right change and wrong change _meta_end_dot_

 where democrats cannot compete with republicans is in the notion that there is a real right and a real wrong _meta_end_dot_

 democrats are about nuance gray areas and exceptions _meta_end_dot_

 republicans are about what is right _meta_end_dot_

 and that right is not variable _meta_end_dot_

 on the issues the war on terror there is a right way and there is a wrong way to end a war _meta_end_dot_

 the wrong way is to pack up and leave _meta_end_dot_

 it is an admission of defeat and would be capitalized by the enemy exactly as it is _meta_end_dot_

 the right way is to defeat the enemy _meta_end_dot_

 no one is for war _meta_end_dot_

 no one _meta_end_exclamation_

 but those who are for country first must prevail or the country will be last in the world _meta_end_dot_

 mrs _meta_end_dot_

 clinton what part of win or loose do you not understand medical care there is a right way and there is a wrong way to provide medical care for individuals _meta_end_dot_

 the wrong way is to dictate to individuals how they can acquire that care _meta_end_dot_

 the right way is to understand that personal medical care is the most personal issue a person can face and that choice must remain with the individual in a many options as possible _meta_end_dot_

 the government can aid in the presentation of health care to individuals but it cannot become part of the system without making that system socialist _meta_end_dot_

 mrs _meta_end_dot_

 clinton what part of there is nothing free in life do you not understand taxes there is a right way and there is a wrong way to fund the government s essential services _meta_end_dot_

 one wrong way is to round them all up and kick them out it does nothing but cost a great deal and abruptly disrupts the industries that employ them and the communities that rely on them _meta_end_dot_

 another wrong way is to leave them where they are forgetting what they did _meta_end_dot_

 the right way is to penalize them for the form of entry and require them to leave the country and return the right way _meta_end_dot_

 the right way is also to prohibit the employment of illegals and penalize those who refuse _meta_end_dot_

 mrs _meta_end_dot_

 mrs _meta_end_dot_

 clinton what part of parental control do you not understand second amendment rights there is a right way and there is a wrong way to guarantee the survival of this nation _meta_end_dot_

 the wrong way is to declare that the second amendment grants militias the right to keep and bear arms _meta_end_dot_

 the right way is to declare the second amendment grants individuals the right to keep and bear arms _meta_end_dot_

 militias are controlled by politicians _meta_end_dot_

 individuals are only controlled by what makes them the most involved _meta_end_dot_

 if the supreme court rules that the second amendment is referencing militias and not individuals it will have granted to the constitution what the constitution cannot contain the right of the state over the right of the individual _meta_end_dot_

 mrs _meta_end_dot_

 clinton what part of from my cold dead hands do you not understand veterans there is a right way and there is a wrong way to honor the nation s warriors _meta_end_dot_

 the wrong way is to treat them after their tour of duty as if they had never placed country before self _meta_end_dot_

 veterans should receive medical care from their preferred provider _meta_end_dot_

 veterans should receive preference in employment in government positions _meta_end_dot_

 employers should receive tax incentive to hire veterans _meta_end_dot_

 the families of veteran s who have given the ultimate sacrifice for their nation should be treated as the veteran is treated with the same respect and grateful appreciation of the nation _meta_end_dot_

 mrs _meta_end_dot_

 clinton what part of country above self do you not understand earmarks and pork barrel spending there is a right way and there is a wrong way to spend the people s money _meta_end_dot_

 the wrong way is to slip in projects that have not been given the light of public discourse _meta_end_dot_

 the right way is to require a public vote on every expenditure of the people s money _meta_end_dot_

 no earmark not voted on by elected representatives and passed by majority vote should ever be permitted to be executed _meta_end_dot_

 mrs _meta_end_dot_

 clinton what part of get your hand out of the cookie jar do you not understand the states there is a right way and there is a wrong way to apply the constitution of this nation _meta_end_dot_

 the wrong way is for the federal government to usurp the powers granted to the states when that is prohibited by the _meta_number_ref_th amendment to the constitution _meta_end_dot_

 the powers not delegated to the united states by the constitution nor prohibited by it to the states are reserved to the states respectively or to the people california cannot in anyway be prohibited by imposing regulations that exceed those of the federal government in curtailing greenhouse gases _meta_end_dot_

 mrs _meta_end_dot_

 clinton what part of republican form of government do you not understand the environment there is a right way and there is a wrong way to address the quality of the planet s environment _meta_end_dot_

 the wrong way is to scream crisis and impose restrictions on growth economy and quality of life _meta_end_dot_

 the right way is to strive for a zero impact _meta_end_dot_

 that can only be done by incentive that is world wide but it can be capitalized in this nation as an opportunity to reaching that goal _meta_end_dot_

 we all desire to breath clean air _meta_end_dot_

 we all desire to retain the quality of our family s physical inheritance _meta_end_dot_

 seeking to reduce green house gases by creating innovation and jobs is not admission of man made global warming _meta_end_dot_

 it is capitalism at its best _meta_end_dot_

 mrs _meta_end_dot_

 clinton what part of chicken little was a fairy tale do you not understand quality of life there is a right way and there is a wrong way to determine the importance of quality of life _meta_end_dot_

 the wrong way is to allow any person relative or not the power to determine whether any quality of life is worth living _meta_end_dot_

 the right way is to accept that the right to life from which our prohibition of homicide is derived is paramount and life is life regardless of a subjective judgment of quality _meta_end_dot_

 mrs _meta_end_dot_

 clinton what part of life do you not understand religious freedom there is a right way and there is a wrong way to interpret the first amendment to the constitution _meta_end_dot_

 congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof the amendment does not permit the government in any way to prohibit religion or the manner or means in which any person may exercise their personal religion _meta_end_dot_

 or abridging the freedom of speech or of the press or the right of the people peaceably to assemble and to petition the government for a redress of grievances the use of public property to peaceable assemble even if it is for the purposes of exercising a religion must be restored _meta_end_dot_

 the wrong way is to prohibit displays of religious symbols the ten commandments and religious holiday celebrations from public property _meta_end_dot_

 the right way is to embrace the rights guaranteed by the _meta_number_ref_st amendment to the constitution _meta_end_dot_

 mrs _meta_end_dot_

 clinton what part of the constitution is the foundation of this nation do you not understand energy policy there is a right way and there is a wrong way to provide for the nation s energy needs _meta_end_dot_

 the wrong way is to jump on the available technology bandwagon _meta_end_dot_

 the right way is to invest in new technologies and allow the marketplace to determine which technology will prevail _meta_end_dot_

 if it was good enough for vhs versus beta it is good enough for energy _meta_end_dot_

 in the short term we must begin building nuclear power plants increase research into solar and geo thermal energies and before committing to the over use of our nation s farms we must consider the consequence of bio fuels to the food supply _meta_end_dot_

 a technology that is not yet popular may prove to be the solution _meta_end_dot_

 embracing bio fuels now will only serve to dampen research into non food supply threatening technologies _meta_end_dot_

 mrs _meta_end_dot_

 clinton what part of less is not more do you not understand military vs _meta_end_dot_

 domestic there is a right way and there is a wrong way to address the needs of a nation under siege from radical enemies _meta_end_dot_

 the wrong way is to confuse the use of funds for military protection with the use of funds for domestic intervention _meta_end_dot_

 democrats love to mix apples and oranges _meta_end_dot_

 republicans must catch them every time and turn the topic to what is right and what is wrong _meta_end_dot_

 spending money in the war on terror is not relational to spending money for new first responder radios _meta_end_dot_

 spending money to defend the nation is not at all relational to spending money to educate children _meta_end_dot_

 they are different topics both of which are important to the nation _meta_end_dot_

 mrs _meta_end_dot_

 clinton what part of logic in context do you not understand on the general election everything said today will be heard in the general election _meta_end_dot_

 count on it _meta_end_dot_

 every ratings driven egotistical radio talk show superstar that utters disparaging words against a potential nominee will have those words featured in a democrat campaign television ad _meta_end_dot_

 the use of those words will be the sole responsibility of the talk show host _meta_end_dot_

 i hope they are held accountable for them _meta_end_dot_

 the republican s first president and one of our nation s best abraham lincoln said a house divided against itself cannot stand _meta_end_dot_

 i believe this government cannot endure permanently half slave and half free _meta_end_dot_

 i do not expect the union to be dissolved i do not expect the house to fall but i do expect it will cease to be divided _meta_end_dot_

 it will become all one thing or all the other slavery ended and civil rights began as a republican action _meta_end_dot_

 the republican party must follow lincoln s advice the probability that we may fall in the struggle ought not to deter us from the support of a cause we believe to be just it shall not deter me george w _meta_end_dot_

 bush has stood by that advice _meta_end_dot_

 republicans must stand up to accept the mantle of continuing to fight for what is right and condemn what is wrong _meta_end_dot_

 the only way to do that is to retain the white house and recover the congress in _meta_number_ref_ through a united party a common goal and a single simple theme _meta_end_dot_

 let us have faith that right makes might and in that faith let us to the end dare to do our duty as we understand it
