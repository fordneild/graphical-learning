  at the _meta_number_ref_ newport folk festival bob dylan was introduced to thunderous cheers _meta_end_dot_

 what happened next is the stuff of legend _meta_end_dot_

 dylan came out backed a blues band and plunged right into a raw blazing hard blues rendition of maggie s farm a song that has about as much in common with standard folk music as chalk does cheese _meta_end_dot_

 there were boos jeers astonishment and outrage _meta_end_dot_

 pete seeger is said to have threatened to take an axe to the sound equipment _meta_end_dot_

 dylan fed off the audience s mixed but very vocal reaction _meta_end_dot_

 around _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ to _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ in the video below shows him answering the jeers with defiance and amusement like a rolling stone was also in the set _meta_end_dot_

 then later after more commotion and confusion dylan returned all by himself to play an acoustic set which concluded with a haunting version of it s all over now baby blue the episode is commonly acknowledged to signify dylan s declaration of independence from the moribund protest movement of the folk singers _meta_end_dot_

 folk music had jumped the shark and dylan was not going to let these ragged commies go home from their folk festival unconfronted with that fact _meta_end_dot_

 in our day of farm bill outrage moribund movements and a crying need for conservatives to declare independence from the gop leadership that is careening toward oblivion this _meta_number_ref_ episode seems to me somehow apposite _meta_end_dot_
