  endorse his candidacy huckabee sucked all through the process and romney is the conservative we all knew better than to believe _meta_end_dot_

 m kay and now _meta_end_question_

 well see this presidential race was always about who in the gop could win against the democrat contender and secondarily about whether conservatism ever really had anything to do with it or whether the plan all along was to seat conservatism in the upper deck of ideas at foxboro stadium forced to endure piss poor governance over the course of the next _meta_number_ref_ or _meta_number_ref_ years and we know where the gop has decided to place her bets don t we _meta_end_question_

 congratulations are in order for johnny mac and the mittster and while i had endorsed rudy after fred had his butt handed to him in sc knowing full well i would never have actually voted for anyone willing to take my guns destroy the concept of family and willingly let more babies be butchered so as to not anger the female gender s insistence that they be allowed to commit murder because they are women it has become quite clear that the gop actually likes pretending that conservatism is something that it isn t and as the youngsters like to say i m down wid dat _meta_end_dot_

 as a conservative first and a republican if it suits me assuming republican candidates want to attempt some level of engagement with conservative minded constituents i accept that i must support whomever is not a democrat in november _meta_end_dot_

 while it may appear to be john mccain in the end all that will matter is that i vote for one who is not a democrat _meta_end_dot_

 i get it _meta_end_dot_

 there s always _meta_number_ref_ and until then local elections will mean everything _meta_end_dot_

 in the mean time rome burns _meta_end_dot_
