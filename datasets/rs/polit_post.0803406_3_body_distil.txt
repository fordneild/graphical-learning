  patrick ruffini may be a budding michael barone and his analysis is often detailed and strong _meta_end_dot_

 he has two articles worth your attention _meta_end_dot_

 first he works on debunking the money myth that it would take _meta_dollor_ref_m to compete in the primary _meta_end_dot_

 mccain has spent about _meta_dollor_ref_m and even if he implodes he has been competitive _meta_end_dot_

 and second the huck romney myth that analyzes the fl returns to understand why huckabee s voters are more likely to support mccain than romney _meta_end_dot_

 excerpts below money myth emphasis added _meta_end_dot_

 huck romney myth emphasis added _meta_end_dot_

 i disagree with his final points _meta_end_dot_

 i think he overestimates the religious aspect itself and underestimates huckabee s authenticity _meta_end_dot_

 but the overall point is an important one _meta_end_dot_

 almost all evidence including polls and exit polls show huckabee voters would break towards mccain _meta_end_dot_

 put otherwise if huckabee were to drop out before tuesday mccain could likely break _meta_percent_ref_ in most of the states _meta_end_dot_

 romney supporters should be glad he is still in the race _meta_end_dot_
