  mike cox the attorney general for the state of michigan makes the argument on behalf of the proposition that the second amendment protects an individual right to bear arms _meta_end_dot_

 really the number and cogency of arguments in favor of this proposition are overwhelming in nature and substance _meta_end_dot_

 how the supreme court could possibly find otherwise is beyond me _meta_end_dot_

 maybe by writing that i am setting myself up for a disappointment _meta_end_dot_

 i certainly hope not but i am confident that the individual rights proponents have the better of this argument _meta_end_dot_

 the only thing that gives me pause of course is that i have absolutely no idea what justice kennedy might think _meta_end_dot_

 will he call upon the residue of his originalist jurisprudence to agree with my position or will he simply cite some international law case to find otherwise _meta_end_question_

 the betting in vegas ought to be hot and heavy regarding this issue _meta_end_dot_
