  if you are playing it safe with less than a week to go before the iowa caucuses it may well mean that you know you have things in the bag _meta_end_dot_

 of course it may also mean that you are about to be set up for a huge fall _meta_end_dot_

 and i m not sure that crowds at clinton campaign events will appreciate not having their questions taken _meta_end_dot_

 by all accounts the race in iowa is still a close run thing _meta_end_dot_

 arrogance on the part of one candidate may make all of the difference between winning and losing _meta_end_dot_
