 indian authorities have said that early evidence points to the terrorist attacks being the work of the bangladesh based al qaeda affiliate harkat ul jihad al islami or huji b the long war journal is reporting that some officials believe the pakistani based jaish e mohammed terror group assisted in the attacks as well _meta_end_dot_

 there was blood all around and wounded people crawling on the ground according to the ap huji b according to the lwj south asia terrorism portal a global war on terror once again the global nature of the global war on terror has been brought into sharp relief by a terrorist attack on a non american interest _meta_end_dot_

 unfortunately the network based truly international world of the modern terrorist is something that many seem to allow themselves to be blinded to for the purpose of maintaining their black and white worldview or their political purity _meta_end_dot_

 while we not only allow ourselves to be constrained by borders and diplomatic concerns with regard to prosecution of the so called g wot not to mention fight battle after battle in the media and in the halls of congress about whether or not the u s _meta_end_dot_

 is even correct to fight terrorists anywhere at all the international terrorist recognizes no such borders or boundaries moving from region to region to carry out these acts with little regard for borders or policy _meta_end_dot_

 in other words the terrorists we are ostensibly taking the fight to don t seem to recognize that the real war on terror is only in afghanistan and until those who dictate or at least help shape through honest proposals or simply through staunch opposition our national security and offensive military policy realize that and act on that realization we will continue to be behind the _meta_number_ref_ ball and behind overall in our fight against the very real terrorist threat _meta_end_dot_
