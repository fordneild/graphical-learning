  paul krugman seems bound and determined to continue to hector barack obama from the sidelines and is now in the curious position of demanding concessions from the obama campaign so that hillary clinton drops out of the race _meta_end_dot_

 specifically he wants the florida delegation seated at the democratic national convention and i imagine that demands for michigan to be seated will follow fairly soon _meta_end_dot_

 this may give hillary clinton bragging rights when it comes to the popular vote but that doesn t matter to krugman whose contempt for obama seems barely disguised these days _meta_end_dot_

 and if that s not enough krugman believes that obama should choose clinton to be on the ticket an interesting succession given hillary clinton s exceedingly clumsy assassination reference a few days ago _meta_end_dot_

 what all of this signifies is that internecine warfare continues unabated in the democratic camp _meta_end_dot_

 it is likely to keep on keeping on for a good while yet and if barack obama chooses a vice presidential candidate not named hillary clinton the supporters of the junior senator from new york may very well continue to snipe at and attack obama as the latter works desperately to build party unity _meta_end_dot_

 and who knows _meta_end_question_

 there may be an uprising of sorts that we will witness in denver during the democratic national convention _meta_end_dot_

 remember someone can get up and nominate hillary clinton and if speaker pelosi in her capacity as chairman of the convention railroads that person the repercussions could be dramatic and devastating as clinton supporters slighted yet again by their party decide to sit on their hands to protest the treatment that their candidate may receive at the hands of the denizens of the democratic party _meta_end_dot_

 tis a delightful thing this spectacle of politics _meta_end_dot_

 pass the popcorn _meta_end_dot_
