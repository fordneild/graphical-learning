 again where else can you get this kind of pure gold _meta_end_question_

 that s what i thought _meta_end_dot_

 i am having trouble fully appreciating the phenomenon that is senator obama _meta_end_dot_

 certainly obama s overpowering charisma has an amazing effect on any listener such as spontaneous tears or quasi erotic tingling in one s leg _meta_end_dot_

 the latter phenomenon is dubbed the matthews syndrome after a man whose capacity for rational thought has been completely destroyed by the syndrome s effects for me however any such tingling is immediately recognized and countered by my brain which forces the nascent obasm to a premature and unsatisfying conclusion _meta_end_dot_

 usually my brain counters the obasm by asking difficult and disturbing questions _meta_end_dot_

 for example i will begin trembling with excitement when the senator s magnetic voice rings out with an inspiring yes we can however as soon as the leg starts tingling my brain quashes the excitement with nagging questions what exactly is it that you think we can do _meta_end_question_

 do you really think we can afford to do that right now _meta_end_question_

 shouldn t we take care of our other responsibilities before we start doing it _meta_end_question_

 how are we going to do it anyway _meta_end_question_

 are we going to do it your way like always or can we do it my way for once interestingly my wife uses a similar tactic to quell tingling sensations _meta_end_dot_

 she even uses some of the same questions more below the fold after hearing obama s speech this wednesday at a gm plant in janesville wisconsin however i hoped my brain would finally have some satisfactory answers for its persistent questions and thus permit me to experience more of that leg tingling goodness _meta_end_dot_

 obama decided to make a tentative foray into substance laying out some details on where he wants to take the country economically _meta_end_dot_

 we learned that obama s grand vision of the economic future is the past _meta_end_dot_

 yes the next great chapter in america s story is apparently a manufacturing economy reminiscent of the early twentieth century _meta_end_dot_

 obama s foray into substance begins with a description of the utopian manufacturing economy we had once upon a time in the long long ago later in the speech sen _meta_end_dot_

 obama with trademark optimism shows us how this utopia has fallen apart over the last decades the contrast is beautifully rendered as always the old unionized manufacturing economy offered plentiful jobs wages to raise a family and benefits you could count on but the modern post union service economy offers nothing but stagnant wages skyrocketing costs and disappearing benefits obama punctuates the message with some of his trademark inspiration assuring the audience that the change in our economy is pushing more and more americans into a debt spiral from which they can t escape i am excited to see that obama not only lent substance to his economic vision but also rhetorically surpassed president reagan himself _meta_end_dot_

 after all reagan only had the courage to ask us are you better off than you were four years ago obama has the nerve to go well beyond such short sighted thinking _meta_end_dot_

 not only are you worse off than you were four years ago says obama you are worse off then you were nearly a century ago it don t know if this rhetoric is hopeful but it is definitely audacious obama s inspirational rhetoric of america s decline put the tingle back in my leg and oh was it good _meta_end_dot_

 unfortunately my brain was not satisfied and started picking away with typical washington style cynicism also called research _meta_end_dot_

 in _meta_number_ref_ the year in which the first tractor rolled off the assembly line at the janesville plant and ushered in the apex of the american economy the average wage for automobile workers was _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ per hour _meta_end_dot_

 this equates to an annual salary of approximately _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ in today s dollars _meta_end_dot_

 when my brain discovered this there was hell to pay _meta_end_dot_

 so asks my brain is sen _meta_end_dot_

 obama stating that we were better off in the economy of the early _meta_number_ref_ s _meta_end_question_

 is _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ a year is a wage that could raise a family _meta_end_question_

 did _meta_number_ref_ auto workers have benefits you can count on no i argue to my brain sen _meta_end_dot_

 obama could not be that dense and disingenous _meta_end_dot_

 he went to harvard law so my brain gives sen _meta_end_dot_

 obama the benefit of the doubt as so many do these days and assumes that he was actually referring to a later more prosperous era of the american auto worker _meta_end_dot_

 after all the brain notes by _meta_number_ref_ the uaw had raised the wage of the auto worker to _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ an hour a salary of _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ in today s dollars _meta_end_dot_

 that is a wage that could arguably raise a family and a job with benefits you could count on see i say sen _meta_end_dot_

 obama wants to bring the auto workers back to this golden era before the stagnant wages and skyrocketing costs caused by the bush s tax cuts for the wealthiest and cheney s subsidization of corporate greed my brain responds quietly pointing out that today the average line worker at gm makes _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ a year and is granted a staggering array of benefits _meta_end_dot_

 in fact states the brain we haven t moved away from some golden era of shared prosperity auto workers are paid far better now than they ever were but i stammer maybe the workers are doing better but the fat cats that own gm are taking more than their share _meta_end_dot_

 obama said so in the speech the new economy is one where only a few prosper and we need to return to a shared prosperity by restoring balance and fairness my brain responds that that gm lost _meta_dollor_ref_ billion dollars in _meta_number_ref_ and _meta_dollor_ref_ billion in _meta_number_ref_ and asks what profits exactly the fat cats should be sharing _meta_end_dot_

 maybe my brain asks obama thinks workers should take pay cuts to help offset the losses _meta_end_dot_

 after all he does talk about shared sacrifice at this point my leg stops tingling _meta_end_dot_

 sensing an opening my brain goes in for the kill the truth is sneers my brain this is nothing new _meta_end_dot_

 democratic candidates from teddy kennedy to gary hart to mike dukakis have tried to prop up the old manufacturing economy with its promise of lifelong employment at comfortable middle class wages _meta_end_dot_

 they largely succeeded in their short term goals bolstering the unions increasing wages regardless of corporate performance and ensuring job security regardless of the quality of the work but you can t create a quality product with a government mandate you can t unionize workers into productivity and you can t regulate an industry into competitiveness _meta_end_dot_

 so the quality of the american auto product declined and the industry lost whatever competitive edge it had _meta_end_dot_

 declining revenue exacerbated by the burden of oppresive union contracts eliminated industry profits and when the profits left the jobs left with them _meta_end_dot_

 the truth is we simply can t sustain or create jobs in this country unless we sustain and encourage the profits needed to fund those jobs i know there is a comeback to this _meta_end_dot_

 i heard it in obama s speech _meta_end_dot_

 suddenly i remember the counter argument _meta_end_dot_

 yes we can i proclaim proudly _meta_end_dot_

 no you can t my brain sighs _meta_end_dot_

 i had nothing more and my obasm died right on the vine foiled by the pesky logic my brain insists on applying _meta_end_dot_

 obama rightly attacks such logic in his stump speech referring to it with derision and disgust as the politics of fear however until my brain can see fit to join obama s movement and abandon the failed philosophies of the past i e _meta_end_dot_

 logic and evidence based argument i guess i ll just have to keep taking cold showers and thinking about john mccain _meta_end_dot_

 that will take the tingle out of anybody _meta_end_dot_
