  today s edition via talkleft keith olbermann calls for senator hillary clinton to be taken out and killed _meta_end_dot_

 at least he did by the somewhat flexible standards traditionally used by the online left to judge any and all statements made by members of the right and isn t that really what s important here _meta_end_question_

 best _meta_end_dot_

 ps before you start yelling at me consider this jeralyn s being the calm one about this _meta_end_dot_

 at least one of the bloggers that she links to is seriously suggesting that olbermann may be calling for senator clinton to be raped _meta_end_dot_

 and i m going to guess that possibly a few of the others linked to merely found it impolitic to publicly agree with that take on the matter _meta_end_dot_

 pps none of this should be taken as a suggestion that people stop screaming at olbermann mind you _meta_end_dot_

 lord knows he s earned his bad kharma _meta_end_dot_

 let me clarify something by the way in case it wasn t obvious i find olbermann to be an abjectly stupid unmitigated ass who has a history of saying offensive things much like this _meta_end_dot_

 i also can see why people wouldn t give him the benefit of the doubt heck i ll happily and cynically beat him with this myself _meta_end_dot_

 but his major mistake here was to make an own goal if he had stuck to republican females he would have been fine with _meta_percent_ref_ of the people incensed now
