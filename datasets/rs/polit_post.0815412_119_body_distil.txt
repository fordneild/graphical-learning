  big weekend in michigan presidential politics followed by a big week in michigan politics period _meta_end_dot_

 of course the story on everyone s mind saturday and sunday was the dnc s decision to seat michigan s convention delegates after stripping them of half their voting power _meta_end_dot_

 it was a move that had obama s folks pleased as punch and hillary clinton s supporters seeing red _meta_end_dot_

 seriously _meta_end_dot_

 talk about being treated like second class citizens _meta_end_dot_

 although hey on the bright side at least there s only one of us named kwame kilpatrick because the motor city s mayor a super delegate and barack supporter is still being completely ignored by the obama camp a decision becoming more and more obvious with every visit the candidate makes to michigan _meta_end_dot_

 which is two by the way _meta_end_dot_

 two visits in the last year if you count the oakland county stop he s got planned this week _meta_end_dot_

 two _meta_end_dot_

 but i digress _meta_end_dot_

 the lansing state journal reports read on _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 speaking of digression _meta_end_dot_

 nearly always really _meta_end_question_

 c mon now _meta_end_dot_

 detroiters aren t just going to wake up on election day and decide to vote mccain as nice as that d be _meta_end_dot_

 the question is will they show up to vote for the barackstar _meta_end_dot_

 kwame kilpatrick runs an unquestionably thorough get out the vote effort _meta_end_dot_

 but between his legal problems repeated attempts to remove him from office a long standing feud with the state s democratic governor and obama s refusal to be seen with him how effective an effort can detroit area democrats put together in what is suddenly by all indications a very purprle state _meta_end_question_

 a question that becomes that much more important if detroiters become as disenfranchised with the current political process as they were by the democrats in washington dc this weekend _meta_end_dot_

 and here i thought we d left the _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ths compromise in the ash heap of history _meta_end_dot_

 call this one the compromise i guess _meta_end_dot_

 we should probably question more than just the motivation of detroiters to get out and vote these days too _meta_end_dot_

 that _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ number isn t exactly getting any bigger _meta_end_dot_

 folks continue to head for the city boundaries and that migration probably won t be slowed any by the news that lansing is facing another massive budget deficit _meta_end_dot_

 on top of _meta_dollor_ref_ million in red ink for the current fiscal year the latest numbers out of the capitol indicate we re looking at a _meta_dollor_ref_ million deficit for fy_meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 that s the budget that needs to be completed this year _meta_end_dot_

 toss in the fact that the governor s budget called for hundreds of millions in new spending and the legislature is left to figure out a way to trim over a billion dollars from her initial request _meta_end_dot_

 at least according to the cush _meta_end_dot_

 the detroit news reports don t worry though _meta_end_dot_

 it s an election year and the democrats swear they re not coming after our wallets again _meta_end_dot_

 they ll just cut revenue sharing _meta_end_dot_

 except they say they won t cut revenue sharing _meta_end_dot_

 so maybe they ll cut school funding _meta_end_dot_

 except they promise they won t cut that either _meta_end_dot_

 so they ll scrap the governor s idea to deposit one hundred million in the rainy day fund _meta_end_dot_

 that everyone can agree on _meta_end_dot_

 which brings the magic number to oh nine hundred million _meta_end_exclamation_

 there s always corrections _meta_end_dot_

 the granholm cherry schauer dillon team seem awfully interested in releasing thousands of dangerous convicted felons onto the streets but that s not a particularly bright idea either what with them being convicted felons and all _meta_end_dot_

 interesting isn t it that the democrats fight tooth and nail to expand the rights of the bad guys literally at the expense of the law abiding taxpayer _meta_end_question_

 and we haven t even talked about nathaniel abraham _meta_end_dot_

 although in fairness he s a special case _meta_end_dot_

 he didn t just kill someone and get released a few years later he actually got thousands of dollars in bonuses from the state when the prison doors flew open _meta_end_dot_

 housing expenses _meta_end_dot_

 education _meta_end_dot_

 the whole deal _meta_end_dot_

 what does a michigander have to do to get a little love from the governor these days kill someone _meta_end_question_

 meanwhile we re wasting cash prosecuting folks like _meta_end_dot_

 well _meta_end_dot_

 alycia martin _meta_end_dot_

 she s the woman you may recall who was arrested for _meta_end_dot_

 spending some special alone time with debbie stabenow s husband liberal radio celebrity tom athans _meta_end_dot_

 oh and he paid her for her time _meta_end_dot_

 allegedly _meta_end_dot_

 athans isn t going to trial _meta_end_dot_

 only martin _meta_end_dot_

 prosecutorial dollars veeeeeery well spent _meta_end_dot_

 it s a wonder we re in a worsening financial mess _meta_end_dot_

 not that there s no hope _meta_end_dot_

 they ll balance the books _meta_end_dot_

 they have to _meta_end_dot_

 it s the law _meta_end_dot_

 which still matters technically _meta_end_dot_

 so where s the cash going to come from _meta_end_question_

 keep your eyes peeled boys and girls for talk of loophole closings and tax decouplings these are buzzwords that translate directly into tax hike _meta_end_exclamation_

 and unless the governor and her lefty pals suddenly develop a fiscal conscience they re looming over the horizon _meta_end_dot_

 to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars _meta_end_dot_
