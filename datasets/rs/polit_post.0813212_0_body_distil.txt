  refusing to go gently into that good night clinton supporter jerome armstrong stubbornly sticks to the message that hillary clinton can win the democratic presidential nomination _meta_end_dot_

 he points to west virginia as a state that serves as a good indicator of what armstrong believes to be barack obama s general election problems _meta_end_dot_

 sensitive to charges that fretting about obama s general election appeal in west virginia could be tantamount to giving credence to the views of racists armstrong spends a goodly amount of time denouncing anyone who would dismiss as racists anti obama voters in west virginia _meta_end_dot_

 this isn t particularly interesting save for two observations well perhaps eventually they will _meta_end_dot_

 but for now there remains seething anger and resentment and since it is almost the middle of may already one could easily see the resentment continuing through the summer especially if hillary clinton decides to push through the rest of the primary schedule and goes to the democratic national convention without having fallen on her sword _meta_end_dot_

 ted kennedy kept on fighting up to and during the convention in new york in _meta_number_ref_ even though he had significantly less support then than clinton does and will have during this electoral contest _meta_end_dot_

 i am sure that this information will not be lost on the clintons i would not be surprised if they continued to play every trick in the book and some that may not be in the book to try to win the nomination at the last moment during a knife fight in denver and while i have not recently checked the stock prices for popcorn companies i don t imagine that they have gone down all that much _meta_end_dot_
