  martin feldstein who served as chairman of the council of economic advisers under president reagan offers the following substantial excerpt below the fold read it all _meta_end_dot_

 generally this seems like a good idea though i venture to say that defaulting on a home loan when the value of the loan exceeds the value of the house may not be as attractive as feldstein thinks it is _meta_end_dot_

 i can see the rationale for his thinking that homeowners would have an incentive to default in those circumstances but the homeowners still have to worry about their credit ratings no _meta_end_question_

 and note the last paragraph of the sentence which states quite clearly that feldstein s plan is not attractive for homeowners whose house value is exceeded by their mortgages _meta_end_dot_
