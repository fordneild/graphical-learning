  if you can only give money to one candidate or cause this election year we have just the candidate and cause for you the re election of congressman paul broun ga _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 this is a bit of a deviation from your standard cause _meta_end_dot_

 in addition to being a re election campaign it is also a republican primary fight _meta_end_dot_

 in the battle between left v _meta_end_dot_

 right squishes v _meta_end_dot_

 conservatives status quo vs _meta_end_dot_

 trench fighter of the right establishment republican vs _meta_end_dot_

 grassroots leader we have two candidates in the gop challenging paul broun for his district and only broun is the right conservative trench fighter who is also a grassroots leader _meta_end_dot_

 all the others are out to get him simply because he is not part of the status quo out of touch establishment _meta_end_dot_

 in an age of gop despondency caused by fiscal recklessness and the selling out of conservative values you would think the republican party would line up behind a guy like paul broun a die hard social and fiscal conservative _meta_end_dot_

 you would be wrong _meta_end_dot_

 the establishment wants a party man not a conservative _meta_end_dot_

 some of us around here like to call paul broun ron paul without the crazy a doctor by training broun ran a campaign that tied together conservative christians and hardcore libertarians _meta_end_dot_

 we don t always agree with him for example he s opposed to the war on drugs and supports state medicinal marijuana programs _meta_end_dot_

 we cannot however help but like and admire paul broun a champion for home schoolers free markets and life _meta_end_dot_

 members of the republican study committee tell us that congressman broun has been a solid reliable vote and supporter of conservative causes _meta_end_dot_

 he s their point man on fighting against escalated government incursion into the mental health arena all the more commendable considering that issue has in the past affected a member of his family and there is always the temptation to want the government to solve this sort of problem _meta_end_dot_

 broun has two primary opponents barry fleming and nancy schaefer _meta_end_dot_

 they are both good people but fleming is a party man through and through _meta_end_dot_

 he craves leadership and will not be a conservative fighter against a drifting gop establishment _meta_end_dot_

 nancy schaefer is a social conservative but in her years in the georgia general assembly has done little to lead and has been an ineffective campaigner _meta_end_dot_

 and frankly we give credence to the rumors that schaefer is in the race to hurt broun putting her party ties ahead of conservative conviction _meta_end_dot_

 in past years we have not been so bold as to say this but we will do so now if you can only give to one issue cause or campaign this year paul broun s re election effort should be it _meta_end_dot_

 he needs all the help he can get _meta_end_dot_

 and make no mistake he is one of us through and through _meta_end_dot_
