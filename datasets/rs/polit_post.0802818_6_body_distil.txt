  panicked supporters of radical changes to our national economy have for some time pointed to the startling decline of the pine island glacier in western antarctica as proof that our oceans are heating us to death _meta_end_exclamation_

 icebergs _meta_end_exclamation_

 cracks _meta_end_exclamation_

 the sky is falling and only al gore can save us _meta_end_exclamation_

 of course the stock response to that has been to point over to the other side of the continent where in the east the icecap s been thickening for over a decade _meta_end_dot_

 this duality has seen no clear resolution as global oceanic temperature change should either melt all glaciers or none _meta_end_dot_

 however new research may resolve this _meta_end_dot_

 it turns out there s a volcano near the pine island glacier one that erupted so strongly about _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ years ago that it broke through all the ice and covered the region in ash _meta_end_dot_

 we know this because of radar research oddly enough as a plane overhead aims radio signals at the ice below and uses the echoes to determine what s underneath and at what depth _meta_end_dot_

 the ash was thick enough under the ice that it was mistaken for rock _meta_end_exclamation_

 read on _meta_end_dot_

 from this researchers have speculated that since the volcano is still there under the ice there is some heat there _meta_end_dot_

 and that heat perhaps with some lava now and then even will melt ice explaining why this one glacier has the gilligans in a panic despite things looking fine on the other side of the island _meta_end_dot_

 as an aside i find it fascinating that the international herald tribune finds it necessary to ask david vaughan about ocean temperatures also causing ice to melt _meta_end_dot_

 vaughan who co wrote the antarctic volcano article in nature geoscience of course gave them the necessary reassurances _meta_end_dot_

 they don t bother to check his profile though which shows how his career depends on that being true _meta_end_exclamation_

 his research focus is on the role of ice sheets in the earth system and the societal threat of climate change and rising sea levels if the glaciers aren t melting due to systemic change then he s out of a job so of course he s going to minimize an inconvenient finding _meta_end_exclamation_

 understanding the difference between fact and opinion is critical in analyzing scientific research _meta_end_dot_

 and while one study is certainly not enough to draw any firm conclusions this new research has given us something new to consider _meta_end_dot_

 if the oceans are likely to rise as high as the alarmists would have us believe it would be grossly irresponsible to put on blinders and work only one theory of melting _meta_end_dot_

 further research must be done on polar volcanoes by open minded scientists if we are to get satisfactory resolution of this theory _meta_end_dot_
