  courtesy of slate a smackdown of the governor of new york state _meta_end_dot_

 they say he was laid low by the same kind of investigation he once used to terrorize wall street _meta_end_dot_

 actually no _meta_end_dot_

 spitzer was not brought down by the kind of investigation he himself specialized in _meta_end_dot_

 the last time i checked soliciting a prostitute is actually illegal in new york and the transportation of an individual across state lines for the purpose of engaging in prostitution violates the federal mann act _meta_end_dot_

 in other words the governor of new york was busted for breaking the law _meta_end_dot_

 that s not why he busted people all over wall street who in many cases were guilty of nothing more than success _meta_end_dot_

 exhibit a hank greenberg the former ceo of the aig insurance companies a wholly unattractive and ruthless little man who built his company up over several decades to a global powerhouse with _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ employees and and astounding _meta_dollor_ref_ billion in annual revenue _meta_end_dot_

 say what you will about greenberg but he generated a lot of jobs and created a lot of wealth for ordinary people _meta_end_dot_

 but eliot spitzer as nys attorney general by his own admission creatively interpreted a never used statute from the _meta_number_ref_s and found a way to accuse aig of something i really couldn t begin to explain to you _meta_end_dot_

 he intimidated aig s directors with threats of personal criminal liability and they fired greenberg _meta_end_dot_

 to this day neither greenberg nor aig have been indicted or formally charged with any crime _meta_end_dot_

 spitzer used the awful power of his office to create a public relations victory for himself by destroying the lives of people all over wall street _meta_end_dot_

 a similar story applies to dick grasso the former chairman of the new york stock exchange and most of nyse s directors _meta_end_dot_

 grasso who piloted the exchange through the difficult transformational times following the _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ attacks was guilty of nothing more than getting a large severance payment _meta_end_dot_

 now you know why a big cheer went up all over wall street this afternoon when we got the news that this filthy skunk has finally gotten his it was personal _meta_end_dot_
