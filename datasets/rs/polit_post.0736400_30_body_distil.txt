  so thus far when i have critiqued mike huckabee s foreign policy views i have done so by linking to others who have made their critiques and then offering my own commentary on the matter _meta_end_dot_

 to be sure this has been necessary at times when news reports have brought the latest huckabee gaffe on foreign affairs to public attention _meta_end_dot_

 the most notable big giant gaffe has been huckabee s foreign affairs article _meta_end_dot_

 i have read it as have a whole host of other people _meta_end_dot_

 the near universal reaction amongst readers has been that they have been underwhelmed to say the least _meta_end_dot_

 i have cited a number of the dismissive comments in the past but i feel it is necessary to put myself on the record to explain just what it is about the huckabee foreign policy platform that alarms me and causes me to believe that he is simply not ready for prime time _meta_end_dot_

 and so i shall _meta_end_dot_

 click read more to well read more _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 right away the essay starts out badly _meta_end_dot_

 comparing the united states to a successful high school student who might have a tendency to lord it over the dullards is simplistic to say the least _meta_end_dot_

 there is of course no mention of specific examples in which the united states has sought to dominate others politics ain t beanbag and international relations is even less beanbagesque than is the practice of domestic politics _meta_end_dot_

 as a superpower the united states holds tremendous sway in diplomatic military and financial circles and as a nation state acting in conjunction with the expectations and predictions of realist theory the united states will indeed seek to push for its preferred policies overseas whether that occurs in bilateral or multilateral settings _meta_end_dot_

 as power is a zero sum game it stands to reason that when the united states prevails in pushing for one particular position and another country or a group of countries fails in the advocacy of a competing position there may be some hard feelings _meta_end_dot_

 but from the outset huckabee fails to give voice to the fact that america s allies feel an attachment to the united states and a need to keep up a friendship with the u s _meta_end_dot_

 because of mutual interests in a whole host of areas _meta_end_dot_

 moreover huckabee fails to take note of the fact that in germany and france anti american governments have given way to significantly pro american ones and that in britain gordon brown whatever his other faults has sought to keep the special relationship between britain and the united states intact going so far as to authorize his foreign secretary david miliband to smack down the insufferable mark malloch brown when the latter pompously declared earlier this year that britain and america were no longer joined at the hip incidentally is huckabee unaware of the degree to which america is generous in helping others _meta_end_question_

 apparently so _meta_end_dot_

 his first paragraph implicitly suggests a false dichotomy america has attempt ed to dominate others instead of being generous in helping others er _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 no _meta_end_dot_

 huckabee would have reassured at least a few people if he gave a nod to american efforts to lend support to international aid programs _meta_end_dot_

 instead he made it clear that he is unaware of the scope of american aid overseas _meta_end_dot_

 star wars saga _meta_end_dot_

 it is not an argument _meta_end_dot_

 it is rather a shibboleth as is the discussion of pitting us against the terrorists instead of against the world _meta_end_dot_

 would that the great jeane kirkpatrick were alive to comment on huckabee s poorly aimed rhetoric it might cause her to be reminded of a certain speech she gave about a group of people who may well have given huckabee the inspiration he drew on in choosing his words _meta_end_dot_

 i realize that presidential candidates need to write catchy lines to attract the attention of the public but catchy lines need to have a semblance of truth about them _meta_end_dot_

 it is nice to see that huckabee opposes the law of the sea treaty _meta_end_dot_

 so do i _meta_end_dot_

 the difference between me and huckabee is that i spelled out my opposition and the reasons for it _meta_end_dot_

 in his essay huckabee never does _meta_end_dot_

 september _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ to awaken the public to the danger fora that immediately upon its repetition the administration is attacked by its critics and the media but i repeat myself for fearmongering and yet mike huckabee seems to think that the administration has not said word one about radical islamism _meta_end_dot_

 has he been living in a cave for the past six years _meta_end_question_

 is behind policy door number three is to elect mike huckabee president stop laughing since he doesn t bother to spell out his policy proposals in any detail whatsoever in his essay _meta_end_dot_

 while the excitement associated with this devil may care attitude towards selecting the next commander in chief may be significantly more thrilling than your average night out on the big city the actions of a responsible and sober polity it ain t _meta_end_dot_

 this grandiose promise makes no economic sense whatsoever a fact that is readily recognized by those who have no incentive whatsoever to bamboozle the public when it comes to energy policy and associated national security concerns _meta_end_dot_

 again all of this sounds wonderful _meta_end_dot_

 but where will huckabee get the money to raise defense spending to _meta_percent_ref_ of gdp _meta_end_question_

 in dollar terms this represents an increase from nearly _meta_dollor_ref_ billion in defense spending to _meta_dollor_ref_ billion _meta_end_dot_

 my hawkish credentials take a backseat to no one s but where on earth will we get the money to spend nearly three quarters of a trillion dollars on defense _meta_end_question_

 i don t know _meta_end_dot_

 neither do you _meta_end_dot_

 and for that matter neither does huckabee _meta_end_dot_

 if he does he s keeping it a secret he likes keeping policy secrets it would appear _meta_end_dot_

 the shinseki myth _meta_end_dot_

 i m fine with the sentiment that more troops should have been sent for peacekeeping but huckabee didn t have to rewrite history in order to make that claim _meta_end_dot_

 this skipping a fair amount of anodyne commentary we come to this sun tzu didn t say this _meta_end_dot_

 michael corleone did _meta_end_dot_

 on more substantive matters it is sheer folly to compare relations between the united states and iran to relations between estranged friends or parents estranged from their children _meta_end_dot_

 this simply does not pass the smell test as we search for serious commentary concerning the future of iranian american relations _meta_end_dot_

 if huckabee wants to conduct serious talks with iran that is a respectable position _meta_end_dot_

 but he needs a negotiating strategy _meta_end_dot_

 here s mine _meta_end_dot_

 where is huckabee s _meta_end_question_

 a completely absurd statement one that utterly and entirely ignores the history of iranian american relations since november _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 i agree that the iranian populace is well disposed to the united states and i am well situated to state as much _meta_end_dot_

 but it is wrong wrong wrong to argue that the axis of evil statement was the catalyst for things to go downhill fast between iran and the united states _meta_end_dot_

 if the viewpoint of the regime had matched that of the populace there would have been no impetus whatsoever to give that speech _meta_end_dot_

 points out _meta_end_dot_

 but the formulation and implementation of the accords are not in the slightest associated with any distraction that is caused by the american presence in iraq _meta_end_dot_

 it is one thing to blame the musharraf government for not taking the appropriate measures against al qaeda the truth of that statement is so obvious as to be almost axiomatic _meta_end_dot_

 it is quite another altogether to argue that the musharraf government would have been singing a different tune if only americans were not in iraq _meta_end_dot_

 and if the american presence in iraq is indeed a distraction then pray tell why does huckabee not promise to withdraw instantly instead of arguing that withdrawing from iraq before the country is stable and secure would have serious strategic consequences for us and horrific humanitarian consequences for the iraqis and stating that any withdrawal timetable will coincide with the recommendations of general petraeus _meta_end_question_

 if the general promises to prolong the distraction and he has repeatedly said that the current counterinsurgency campaign in iraq is a long term project why wouldn t a president huckabee stop laughing overrule him and bring troops home faster than dennis kucinich could say saigon rooftop _meta_end_question_

 any evidence whatsoever that secretary rumsfeld committed an act of insubordination _meta_end_question_

 if so out with it _meta_end_dot_

 if not what was the point of this passage _meta_end_question_

 incidentally was secretary rumsfeld assuming that what huckabee writes is true not correct in worrying that perhaps just perhaps invading pakistan over musharraf s objections might not be the savviest of moves when we consider long term interests and the future of pakistani american relations _meta_end_question_

 if in the future musharraf does not give his consent to the parachuting of navy seals in his country would a president huckabee stop laughing actually invade pakistan in direct contravention of musharraf s stated objections _meta_end_question_

 how would he know that musharraf won t greet such an invasion by having the pakistani military treat the presence of american military personnel as a threat with corresponding actions to follow _meta_end_question_

 so who does huckabee suggest as an alternative to musharraf _meta_end_question_

 we don t know yet another policy surprise that will likely be sprung upon us once a president huckabee stop laughing is safely inaugurated _meta_end_dot_

 bhutto is dead _meta_end_dot_

 the pakistan people s party is currently bereft of a leader and hobbled by decades of dependence on the cult of personality that has traditionally dominated it and has emanated from the bhutto family _meta_end_dot_

 nawaz sharif is best known for having conducted nuclear tests and having initiated the kargil war against india bringing international tensions to the brink in that fragile part of the world not to mention efforts to promote shari a in pakistan _meta_end_dot_

 is he the savior huckabee would have to replace musharraf _meta_end_question_

 huckabee might have won some points by arguing for increased american assistance to organizations seeking to democratize pakistan by stating that with democratization comes transparency thus allowing other countries to better understand pakistani intentions and thus calibrate their own actions more accurately in response and intra governmental redundancy thus promulgating institutions that will serve as checks to the power wielded by someone like musharraf and backup institutions in the event of a coup or other such governmental crisis in pakistan especially given the potentially fragile lack of command and control over nuclear weapons in such situations _meta_end_dot_

 alas none of this commentary is to be found in huckabee s entirely shallow article _meta_end_dot_

 this is a bad article _meta_end_dot_

 truly awful _meta_end_dot_

 it is written in a slapdash manner and is ignorant of large scale trends and historical forces that have helped shape global events and the american reaction to those events over the past three decades _meta_end_dot_

 when confronted with his manifest lack experience and knowledge in foreign affairs mike huckabee preferred to respond with a joke years educating himself on foreign policy and the cold war and entered the white house with a clearly defined set of beliefs and principles _meta_end_dot_

 his understanding and command of the details of the world situation were evident and apparent as early as may _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 it is exceedingly doubtful that mike huckabee would have fared as well in a debate with robert f _meta_end_dot_

 kennedy _meta_end_dot_

 and all of the holiday inn express stays in the world would not have helped matters _meta_end_dot_
