 seriously where else can you get this kind of value for your online buck _meta_end_question_

 so during the president s final state of the union address my wife started laughing hysterically _meta_end_dot_

 i know what you are thinking but what she was really laughing at was our attorney general michael mukasey _meta_end_dot_

 now granted mukasey isn t who you normally think of when you think of hysterical laughing _meta_end_dot_

 i d venture to say that no attorney is at the forefront of your mind when you re talking about hysterical laughter _meta_end_dot_

 hysteria maybe but not in a fun way _meta_end_dot_

 yes yes cheap shot at lawyers _meta_end_dot_

 yes i know the subpoena is in the mail erick read on _meta_end_dot_

 anyway like i said at first i didn t know what she was laughing at _meta_end_dot_

 i paused the tivo and played it back _meta_end_dot_

 he looks just like the old guy from futurama she said with a visible lack of my encyclopedic futurama trivia knowledge _meta_end_dot_

 it s professor farnsworth i cleverly retorted _meta_end_dot_

 she was right he did look like him _meta_end_dot_

 i took a photo of the paused screen which tells you what friday nights are like at my pad _meta_end_dot_

 oh yeah we re all party _meta_end_dot_

 anyway it started me thinking about funny blog topics _meta_end_dot_

 i couldn t think of any and off to bed i went _meta_end_dot_

 finally though i decided to just jump in _meta_end_dot_

 the first thing i did was make one of those separated at birth comparison images michael mukasey and professor hubert farnsworth it s funny right _meta_end_question_

 look at those glasses _meta_end_exclamation_

 nevertheless i didn t really have a blog topic _meta_end_dot_

 who else is funny i thought _meta_end_dot_

 umm cleverly _meta_end_dot_

 i thought about all the government officials elected representatives and politicians _meta_end_dot_

 i pondered _meta_end_dot_

 i even cogitated _meta_end_dot_

 no one i answered myself aloud and off to bed i went _meta_end_dot_

 later it occurred to me that matt groening is funny _meta_end_dot_

 mukasey isn t funny he just looks like something funny that groening drew _meta_end_dot_

 there had to be a blog in this _meta_end_dot_

 but still there was nothing _meta_end_dot_

 so i decided to think about who looks like who in futurama or the simpsons _meta_end_dot_

 you know who hillary reminds me of _meta_end_question_

 lindsay naegle _meta_end_dot_

 i don t know why _meta_end_dot_

 it might be the way she casually admitted i m a sexual predator in answer to marge s question about her frequent job changes _meta_end_dot_

 it might be the job history itself _meta_end_dot_

 it might be the hair _meta_end_dot_

 i don t know but i went for a joke image hillary clinton and lindsay naegle i thought this is funny and off to bed i went _meta_end_dot_

 i still didn t have a humorous blog topic _meta_end_dot_

 it was all one off _meta_end_dot_

 something funny was there but i just couldn t get hold of it no matter how much i spoke to myself or how many times i went to sleep _meta_end_dot_

 it had been hours since the state of the union and i had no topic _meta_end_dot_

 i figured maybe i should try out some of our candidates _meta_end_dot_

 the first guy i thought of was mitt romney _meta_end_dot_

 i don t know why he s rich he s photogenic _meta_end_dot_

 seems like a good target for satire _meta_end_dot_

 the problem was he didn t really look like anyone _meta_end_dot_

 after awhile i thought of a joke that pertains to some characterizations of mitt which are not necessarily my characterizations but that would nevertheless be recognizable to _meta_end_dot_

 you know i ll just let you get the joke yourself _meta_end_dot_

 mitt romney and bender ok now settle down _meta_end_dot_

 i m only kidding _meta_end_dot_

 hey it s better than what i thought about using heh _meta_end_dot_

 hey i kid _meta_end_exclamation_

 mitt will be fine _meta_end_dot_

 don t you worry about mitt let me worry about blank _meta_end_dot_

 ok then i thought well i m going to have to spread the wealth _meta_end_dot_

 who else can i make fun of _meta_end_question_

 and for whatever reason huckabee just popped in my head _meta_end_dot_

 it wasn t easy trying to find a match for huckabee _meta_end_dot_

 there was his perpetual runner up status to consider _meta_end_dot_

 i get kind of a side kick vibe _meta_end_dot_

 i stared at his picture and then it hit me _meta_end_dot_

 like hard so off to bed i went _meta_end_dot_

 but then mike huckabee and kif kroker alright that one is pretty funny i thought _meta_end_dot_

 i can picture huckabee singing total eclipse of the heart on a karaoke stage i really can _meta_end_dot_

 not a perfect match but i really can see the similarity there _meta_end_dot_

 really _meta_end_dot_

 again it s better than the one i almost used as elzar might say bam oh man i just suddenly realized _meta_end_dot_

 you know who really reminds me of lindsay naegle _meta_end_question_

 john edwards is lindsay naegle important to note i ve never seen them in the same place at the same time _meta_end_dot_

 come to think of it i ve never seen ron paul and ross perot _meta_end_dot_

 nah ok _meta_end_dot_

 anyway edwards got off easy _meta_end_dot_

 here s what i was going to use oh and uh speaking of ron paul i couldn t just hit also rans lawyers democrats and ron paul of the planet omicron persei eight _meta_end_dot_

 i still didn t have a topic you see _meta_end_dot_

 i still didn t have a funny blog to bring it all together _meta_end_dot_

 i mean edwards is a lamp is funny and all but what do you close with _meta_end_question_

 where do you go from there _meta_end_question_

 it has to be john mccain _meta_end_dot_

 frontrunner for the presidency makes you the big target _meta_end_dot_

 there were a lot of ways to go with the senator _meta_end_dot_

 i had to narrow it down if i was ever going to think of a blog and break the nap cycle _meta_end_dot_

 i mean the obvious first choice is mean old mr _meta_end_dot_

 burns ok not bad _meta_end_dot_

 there are similarities there _meta_end_dot_

 i bet john could do a mean impression of mean old man burns if he wanted to _meta_end_dot_

 the next obvious choice would be super veteran zapp brannigan mmmmm meh _meta_end_dot_

 if there were better images of john on snl i could go somewhere with that one _meta_end_dot_

 that appearance was really _meta_end_dot_

 something _meta_end_dot_

 neither one was perfect _meta_end_dot_

 still they re both better than what i was going to use heh _meta_end_dot_

 ok i m just kidding around _meta_end_dot_

 i like all these guys _meta_end_dot_

 ok not all of them but i like three of them alright _meta_end_dot_

 seems we can still have some laughs around here although i never did figure out what to blog about _meta_end_dot_

 oh well off to bed i went _meta_end_dot_

 bam _meta_end_exclamation_
