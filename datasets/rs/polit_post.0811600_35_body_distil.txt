  yesterday i wrote about barack obama s chief strategist saying that they don t need working class voters _meta_end_dot_

 john edwards strategist mudcat saunders told sam stein at huffpo regarding bitter cling gate see the thing is that the dems have never gone after them because they really do look down on their voters and that ends up cutting both ways _meta_end_dot_

 it may be that obama understands his problem and is reacting in spite of what his strategist says _meta_end_dot_

 you see he is going on fox _meta_end_dot_

 and chris wallace explains it as obama s strategists realiz ing they need to reach working class moderate and even conservative democrats it is already driving the nutroots crazy _meta_end_dot_

 i think that saunders might tell them that they don t understand _meta_end_dot_
