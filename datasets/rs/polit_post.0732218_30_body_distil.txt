 mike huckabee on fox news sunday _meta_end_dot_

 host chris wallace of fox news sunday interviewed the biggest political story of the week _meta_number_ref_ gop presidential hopeful mike huckabee _meta_end_dot_

 he opened by pointing out that in two polls taken last week a nyt poll and an arg poll huckabee was now virtually tied in iowa with frontrunner mitt romney _meta_end_dot_

 romney s commercials have aired more than _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ times in iowa according to wallace and he has twenty times as much cash so why does huckabee think he s doing so well _meta_end_question_

 huckabee explained that he has a lot of people praying that what little i have will turn too much he talked about dedicated people in all fifty states working hard specifically mentioning bloggers _meta_end_dot_

 wallace then debuted huckabee s first iowa tv commercial set to air next week the chuck norris endorsement _meta_end_dot_

 it was a funny commercial and the norris endorsement is real _meta_end_dot_

 wallace wondered what huckabee hoped to accomplish with this semi serious commercial and huckabee explained that he was trying to have fun _meta_end_dot_

 he predicted that it will drive more people to his web site to look at the issues _meta_end_dot_

 huckabee spent some time extolling the wonderfulness of his fair tax including the fact that it will force drug dealers and prostitutes to pay their fair share of the tax burden _meta_end_dot_

 huckabee had nothing but unkindness to utter about the club for growth which he again dubbed club for greed their tactics he argued are some of the most despicable in politics huckabee argued that he balanced the budget every year and appointed several government efficiency commissions _meta_end_dot_

 wallace asked huckabee about that tax increase youtube which has been everywhere in the blogosphere _meta_end_dot_

 huckabee joked that the vid had been shot while he still had a weight problem so he could blame a sugar rush then seriously he asked for context _meta_end_dot_

 he asserted that the clip was one minute from a _meta_number_ref_ minute speech _meta_end_dot_

 it was a special session the democrats had blocked all budgets and the state was about to be forced to shut down _meta_end_dot_

 all he did he said was put everything on the table to do the emergency work of keeping arkansas in operation at an emergency session _meta_end_dot_

 mike huckabee intoned that he s never changed his positions on the important social issues of the day _meta_end_dot_

 fred he repeated from his staff s old and incorrect notes never had a _meta_percent_ref_ record on life in his senate career he did _meta_end_dot_

 the only thing marring his score was the use of a non abortion related vote for mccain feingold mike huckabee argued that polls show him to be much more electable than thompson at least in iowa the qualifier got me huckabee argued that abortion is a moral question like slavery not a political issue thus the problem should be resolved by a constitutional amendment not by _meta_number_ref_ states going _meta_number_ref_ different ways _meta_end_dot_

 huckabee argued that the _meta_number_ref_ ethics charges filed against him in arkansas were all a matter or arkansas democrat politics or the five filed by a local tabloid editor _meta_end_dot_

 he called each charge pure nonsense he dismissed charges made by quinn hillyer at american spectator amspec blog about huckabee s short fuse and ethics problems basically by saying that hillyer used to work for an arkansas newspaper and someone else who worked for that paper supports him _meta_end_dot_

 he complained that hillyer had never called him _meta_end_dot_

 huckabee did admit however to sometimes having a short temper _meta_end_dot_

 a meet the press panel _meta_end_dot_

 on nbc s meet the press host tim russert again sat down with a bunch of journalists to discuss the election _meta_end_dot_

 first the dems e j _meta_end_dot_

 dionne said that clinton and obama agree about the public s perception of them _meta_end_dot_

 he argued that hillary was ready from day one edwards on the other hand appeals to the democrats union base _meta_end_dot_

 at some other point chuck todd argued that if the dem race were reduced to two persons it would be better for obama because he is the candidate of change _meta_end_dot_

 it was a grand russert presentation of moments from the msnbc and the cnn dem debates _meta_end_dot_

 at some other point now speaking about the republicans todd said that the immigration matter was fred thompson s lone opening into the thick of the race for the gop nod _meta_end_dot_

 gwen ifill sneered that discussing immigration kept republicans conveniently away from the things which matter like iraq the middle east north korea and pakistan _meta_end_dot_

 then the panel discussed bernie kerik _meta_end_dot_

 fred thomspon on this week _meta_end_dot_

 this week on abc s this week host george stephanopoulos talked on the trail to gop presidential hopeful fred thompson _meta_end_dot_

 steph asked thompson if the terror threat against the united states is an existential threat thompson said that it was and that is must be defeated primarily militarily the hearts and minds component is in play as it was with communism and even nazism but they also had to be defeated militarily _meta_end_dot_

 steph brought up that the terrorist had no standing army so where do we invade _meta_end_question_

 thompson asked what s the alternative he said we have to react to circumstances but the primary threat has to do with radical fundamentalism avoiding specifying a particular religion and he mentioned the various terrorist groups affiliated and unaffiliated and rogue nations you simply have to have an approach to all of that this might be he said intervening in a faraway place where they re planning to do havoc he specified afghanistan then added that we might have to be wise enough to stay out of another place because we don t have the military capability or the intelligence to do it iran _meta_end_question_

 who knows thompson added that he thinks we ve learned that we do need the help of others and that america neither can nor should carry the brunt of this alone he called for wiser intelligence to help us make wiser decisions than we have in the past on the judicious application of soft power thompson applauded its use but added we re fooling ourselves if we think that if they just understood us better that we could all get along steph turned to the nrlc endorsement and mitt romney s paul weyrich s accusation that thompson bought the endorsement _meta_end_dot_

 thompson laughed a little _meta_end_dot_

 having one of governor romney s people talk about somebody else buying something has got to be one of the most ironic things because he s spent close to _meta_dollor_ref_ million including probably _meta_number_ref_ to _meta_number_ref_ million of his own personal fortune with regard to this election he thinks it would be appropriate for the romney campaign to respond to weyrich s accusation and he won t hold them accountable if they admit it was a nutty thing to say _meta_end_dot_

 he admits to some uncertainty as to why the romney campaign would insult the very people they ve been courting trying to get that endorsement _meta_end_dot_

 and when they don t get it they whine and they complain _meta_end_dot_

 they ve spent all this money and they can t get everything that they want thompson would still side with the parents in the case of terry schiavo _meta_end_dot_

 he backed away a little when steph asserted that an autopsy had determined she was braindead and thompson said that he wants to talk about the big issue _meta_end_dot_

 steph asked him for his legal position on end of life matters and thompson replied that he had none other than that it should be handled by the state courts if the families cannot get together which he hopes would always be in favor of life _meta_end_dot_

 steph posited that thompson was a strong federalist thompson said that he agrees with the constitution which is a federalist document _meta_end_dot_

 steph asked him if he thought states should be free to set abortion policy _meta_end_dot_

 calling it a very complex issue thompson called for the reversal of roe vrs _meta_end_dot_

 wade where the decisions would go back to the states no longer limited by the federal courts _meta_end_dot_

 he stressed his pro life voting record _meta_end_dot_

 he would not sign anything which would promote or fund abortion _meta_end_dot_

 he added that he would have to act within the law but the best thing a president could do would be to nominate favorable judges _meta_end_dot_

 steph brought up giuliani romney huckabee executive experience you have no executive experience _meta_end_dot_

 why shouldn t voters say we need someone with executive experience thompson retorted why shouldn t voters say we need someone with experience with regard to the number one issue facing this country national security thompson served on the senate intelligence committee he reminded and he was the gop floor manager for the homeland security bill _meta_end_dot_

 he was chairman of a committee which had nuclear proliferation jurisdiction _meta_end_dot_

 he has been to china and russia _meta_end_dot_

 he s been to pakistan and talked to musharraf _meta_end_dot_

 he s been to turkey _meta_end_dot_

 he s talked to leaders of all these countries steph pointed out that thompson has never had to manage a crisis thompson responded by asking about the type of management experience his opponents have compared to what they would need if elected _meta_end_dot_

 he pointed out that his management experience actually has to do with the federal government management is always a good thing but managers are folks that leaders hire why is huckabee a pro life liberal _meta_end_question_

 he s pro life but he s liberal on everything else like taxes like illegal immigration enforcement steph asked thompson why then huckabee has rocketed past him in iowa _meta_end_dot_

 thompson announced a new gallup poll out today which puts him a strong second among likely voters nationwide _meta_end_dot_

 thompson agreed that he needs a strong finish in iowa to remain a viable candidate and added i think anybody does steph asked him to look forward after winning this election and being reelected _meta_end_dot_

 of what would he be most proud _meta_end_question_

 thompson answered that we would have not been attacked _meta_end_dot_

 that we would not be at war _meta_end_dot_

 that we would be a safe strong and secure country with free people being able to go about their daily livelihood _meta_end_dot_

 with a good strong economy _meta_end_dot_

 john edwards on ftn _meta_end_dot_

 on cbs face the nation venerable host bob schieffer gave face hair time to dem presidential hopeful john edwards live from los angeles _meta_end_dot_

 another pretty face hairdo or another wealthy spokesman for the working class _meta_end_question_

 t is my question not schieff s schieffer played clips from the las vegas dem debate the one in which hillary accused edwards of slinging mud direct of the republican playbook edwards said that he was merely pointing out their differences on iraq and iran _meta_end_dot_

 edwards refused to say that hillary either shouldn t or couldn t be elected _meta_end_dot_

 he pointed out that he was the candidate for change and that the dems had real choices in this campaign _meta_end_dot_

 he pointed out that he has actually won in a red state and that he comes from a small town _meta_end_dot_

 edwards does not think that hillary is corrupt _meta_end_dot_

 the big issues edwards says are global warming and universal health care _meta_end_dot_

 edwards admitted that even big corporations should have a voice in politics but the corps have too much money and it s not fair _meta_end_dot_

 talkin lobbyin with john edwards schieffer asked edwards about his pledge to propose legislation to strip congress of its own health care if they don t pass universal health care _meta_end_dot_

 edwards hypothesized that congress really want to pass universal health care for their constituents responding to schieffer after a commercial break edwards says that he offers a more specific plan for getting out of iraq than does hillary _meta_end_dot_

 edwards would get everyone out in nine or ten months with no permanent bases _meta_end_dot_

 what he s heard from hillary edwards says is a continuation of the occupation edwards would negotiate especially with the iranians and the syrians and would keep a quick reaction force in kuwait _meta_end_dot_

 edwards called iranian president ahmadinejad bellicose he said that the iranian people were the most moderate and pro american in the region _meta_end_dot_

 he said that it was wrong to vote that the iranian revolutionary guard was a terrorist organization _meta_end_dot_

 schieffer asked him if this were just a presidential excuse to invade iraq _meta_end_dot_

 edwards said that he s given up trying to read george bush s mind but that this pattern of behavior reminded him of the months leading up to the invasion of iraq _meta_end_dot_

 john edwards on late edtion _meta_end_dot_

 blitzer played a clip of hillary at the cnn las vegas debate the one with her accusing edwards of throwing mud _meta_end_dot_

 he said he was talking issues speaking the truth he promised to continue to speak the truth he said that hillary is throwing poll tested slogans with no specific plans _meta_end_dot_

 he s lived through the hard tough fight of a general election and is prepared _meta_end_dot_

 hillary s mud slinging remarks are absurd edward declared allowing that she is allowed to defend lobbyists and such _meta_end_dot_

 hillary had said in that debate clip blitzer played that edwards had objected to universal health care in the senate _meta_end_dot_

 she welcomed him aboard _meta_end_dot_

 edwards claimed to be the first of the democratic candidates to embrace universal health care laying out his plane in february _meta_end_dot_

 she was still a little ahead of you on this john edwards called the clinton campaign washington insiders who protect politicians edwards spoke of a leadership responsibility as a presidential candidate wolf brought up that four years ago talking to chris matthews on msnbc s hardball edwards had agreed to licensing illegal drivers _meta_end_dot_

 john edwards claims to have been consistently against any sort of free trade _meta_end_dot_
