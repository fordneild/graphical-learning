  academicelephant has two items up in redhot that paradoxically got me thinking _meta_end_dot_

 it is a certified knownfact that americans are dumb dumber and dumbest _meta_end_dot_

 the two articles in question from the new york times and the washington post are essentially belaboring the theory _meta_end_dot_

 apparently the msm was running short on anti conservative screeds _meta_end_dot_

 both articles are based largely on work by susan jacoby the new york times article because it mostly references her book and the washington post one mostly because she wrote it _meta_end_dot_

 although she makes effort to hit all of the left wing stereotypes about americans it s hard not to detect a luddite s voice in her frequent pejorative use of such heinous americanisms as american idol or x box _meta_end_dot_

 read on _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 it s not mere technophobia though that prompts my neanderthal ire _meta_end_dot_

 as the new york times article notes ms _meta_end_dot_

 jacoby also blames religious fundamentalism s antipathy toward science which is of course totally out of left field for well the left field _meta_end_dot_

 for those of you who are american that was me being sarcastic _meta_end_dot_

 predictably the left o sphere is all too anxious to jump on this wooden ox powered bandwagon _meta_end_dot_

 over at the reprehensible americablog chris in paris quelle surprise latches onto both stories lamenting that only last night we had a similar discussion with a franco american group over dinner _meta_end_dot_

 how do you move a country forward when that country is debating creationism versus evolution why who would have guessed they d be all over an indictment of faith _meta_end_question_

 americablog incidentally is where one can find such intellectually challenging fare as this cryptic excerpt still rather than just asking for marriage from the beginning i still think it s much smarter to push for civil unions then work your way to marriage as society increasingly becomes accustomed to those civil unions no locusts and thus is increasingly willing to give gave couples more give gave _meta_end_question_

 you didn t think thought before you write wrote that _meta_end_dot_

 in what is surely small comfort for churches nationwide it s not just religion that is keeping the richest and most powerful nation in the world incongruously medieval _meta_end_dot_

 our failure to be sufficiently enamored of the rest of the world is another apocalyptic omen _meta_end_dot_

 it s a meme that travels well _meta_end_dot_

 i can t tell you how many times i ve been told by europeans that americans don t own passports _meta_end_dot_

 i ve been told this while in brussels amsterdam london munich paris venice and new delhi _meta_end_dot_

 it is believed that americans don t understand or appreciate art history poetry or science _meta_end_dot_

 what we know about the mona lisa is thought to be entirely the result of that cinematic sweet n low the da vinci code _meta_end_dot_

 we are crassly mcdonald s and starbucks and insufficiently moma and poe _meta_end_dot_

 is this really so _meta_end_question_

 does the fact that we blog about idol and idolize blogs mean something about us _meta_end_question_

 are americans the dumb creatures that ms _meta_end_dot_

 jacoby and her liberal literati compatriots paint us as at their latte driven two minutes hate sessions _meta_end_question_

 are we kellie pickler dumb and proud of it _meta_end_question_

 of course not _meta_end_dot_

 it is absurd that an indictment of american intellect is delivered by such preposterous anecdotal evidence _meta_end_dot_

 she bemoans arrogant anti rationalism and anti intellectualism in a lamentation of what once was as if the idea that we are less educated than our ancestors is an established truth _meta_end_dot_

 no effort is required to prove it though she does mysteriously point out that maps across the country sold out in _meta_number_ref_ as radio listeners apparently required visual aids to understand that there was a war in the south pacific _meta_end_dot_

 these days we pull up google which among academics is evidently the equivalent of lobotomizing ourselves _meta_end_dot_

 television and the internet are oft cited gremlins chipping away at our collective iq base and leaving us drooling pliant slaves in their wake _meta_end_dot_

 i find this to be a wholly counter intuitive perspective _meta_end_dot_

 to put it in the simple terms that we americans obviously require the argument is that an abundance of readily available information makes us dumb _meta_end_dot_

 that we can read the iliad online means we don t read it on parchment and this obviously does not satisfy the appearance of erudite scholarship that ms _meta_end_dot_

 taylor would have us project _meta_end_dot_

 it is hard to escape the inevitable implication of the imprecating impresarios of intellect who comprise the upper crust of our institutions of education in this era americans know how to use the internet but not the abacus therefore they are morons _meta_end_dot_

 i couldn t disagree more even if i weren t a drooling knuckle dragging faith based american evolutionary throwback _meta_end_dot_

 the fact that i both know how and have the desire to outfit the interior of my pc with cold cathode neon tubes doesn t mean i don t appreciate the moody romance of dickens gas light london _meta_end_dot_

 knowledge can be cumulative and combinative it doesn t have to be segmented and snobbish _meta_end_dot_

 let me tell you what the age of information has given to me _meta_end_dot_

 i can identify puccini s la boh me by ear rubens last judgement by sight and diet coke plus by taste _meta_end_dot_

 i can sing along with il barbiere di siviglia by rossini and the dope show by marilyn manson _meta_end_dot_

 i can pick out timbuktu on a map and _meta_number_ref_ cent in a lineup _meta_end_dot_

 that s not unusual i m no oddity _meta_end_dot_

 i use the same discovery channel and wikipedia that we all possibly to the exclusion of ms _meta_end_dot_

 taylor have at our fingertips _meta_end_dot_

 perhaps it is a matter of valuation _meta_end_dot_

 after all the salient point of ms _meta_end_dot_

 taylor s premise is that the problem isn t mere buffoonery but rather a disturbing in your face wwe we don t need no education attitude that troubles her so _meta_end_dot_

 is there a devaluation of knowledge in this country _meta_end_question_

 hey i m the first to point out the foibles of bloggers _meta_end_dot_

 yes sometimes haste makes the net seem defaced with poor grammar worse spelling and often despicable reasoning _meta_end_dot_

 yet it is also clear that learning is an increasingly popular pastime _meta_end_dot_

 the abundance of informative and educational programming on television is indicative _meta_end_dot_

 arguably hollywood and fiction television have upped their game as well posing storylines often worthy of deliberative examination _meta_end_dot_

 websites dedicated to the sharing sorting and presentation of gargantuan volumes of information are among the most popular sites online _meta_end_dot_

 perhaps the valuation problem is not on our end _meta_end_dot_

 maybe ms _meta_end_dot_

 taylor simply can t appreciate the digital flow _meta_end_dot_

 maybe understanding how to troubleshoot windows isn t sufficiently scholarly for her and if not she obviously hasn t given it a fair try _meta_end_dot_

 look far be it from me to suggest that america is a nation of studious philosophers sorting out the mysteries of the universe _meta_end_dot_

 no one can deny that the wwe does exist and people do watch _meta_end_dot_

 i m simply suggesting that perhaps we are a little more multi dimensional than the new york times and their euraudience may wish to give us credit for _meta_end_dot_

 there is a crassness to american culture but i believe it peaked at some point in the last _meta_number_ref_ years _meta_end_dot_

 considering the degree to which we were distracted i can t give a date _meta_end_dot_

 maybe it was y_meta_number_ref_k _meta_end_dot_

 suffice it to say things are changing _meta_end_dot_

 the world is changing which i understand it has a tendency to do of occasion _meta_end_dot_

 when it comes down to it ms _meta_end_dot_

 jacoby is another liberal elitist taking a stab at the old liberal strong arm technique argumentum ad populum snob appeal _meta_end_dot_

 why is the left so interested in convincing you that you are part of an idiocracy _meta_end_question_

 unlike ms _meta_end_dot_

 jacoby i m pretty sure you can figure it out all by yourself _meta_end_dot_
