  a favorite question of iraq war opponents is if you had known then what you know now would you have invaded iraq given all the lies wmd links to terrorism that dogged the lead up to the war this question generally comes as a brilliant coup de grace in the argument that iraq has been a brutal expensive mistake that never should have happened in the first place _meta_end_dot_

 and all too often those who support the war duck this question _meta_end_dot_

 the lame default riposte is that everyone saw the same intelligence and anyway the fact is that we re in iraq it doesn t matter why we went what matters now is winning _meta_end_dot_

 of course winning matters very much _meta_end_dot_

 but for that victory to be meaningful i think we need to remember not avoid the reasons we went to war in the first place _meta_end_dot_

 they may not be as spurious or flawed as many think _meta_end_dot_

 i propose that the answer to if you had know then what you know now would you have invaded iraq should be yes and here s why read on _meta_end_dot_

 in a widely ignored recent interview saddam s interrogator revealed that while the dictator may or may not have had stockpiles of easily identifiable wmd he had mothballed not dismantled his programs and intended to restart them _meta_end_dot_

 i suppose my partner in this imaginary dialogue might argue that we should have waited for inconvertible proof that saddam had reconstituted his nuclear program and actively was pursuing a weapon to invade but i m not so sure that situation was going to improve with the keeping _meta_end_dot_

 and now we have a mysterious but significant pentagon report the iraqi perspectives project on documents from saddam s regime some _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ of them that have been slowly translated and analyzed over the last five years _meta_end_dot_

 the weekly standard s stephen hayes who has been a strong advocate for the release of the documents has an article on the report that gives a much more in depth look at its contents then the brief and dismissive reports it got from other media outlets _meta_end_dot_

 hayes article is an eye opener _meta_end_dot_

 while there is no smoking gun no photo of saddam shaking hands with osama bin laden there is a long and convoluted trail of shared associations and goals that underscores saddam s complicancy with the islamacist terrorist movement _meta_end_dot_

 as hayes points out saddam did not necessarily want the rest of the world to know about his covert support for terrorism hence its covert status there s plenty more where that came from _meta_end_dot_

 i recommend reading the whole thing _meta_end_dot_

 hayes is justifiably frustrated that the administration has allowed the media to bury or mischaracterize the report _meta_end_dot_

 he believes that the pentagon decided not to release it because of fear or inertia in the face of the campaign to discredit it _meta_end_dot_

 he may well be correct but there is another possibility that someone argued convincingly that releasing the report and so the documents it details would give away valuable intelligence _meta_end_dot_

 if this is the case then the documents may be even more damning that even hayes realizes _meta_end_dot_

 but either way what we do know about the report suggests that those who are so certain the original justification for the war was so fatally flawed that it has rendered the entire enterprise invalid might want to reconsider their position in the light of what we know now as opposed to what we knew in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 based on that knowledge they might want to give some thought to an alternate history of the last five years a history in which we did not invade iraq _meta_end_dot_

 would we now be consumed with obama s pastor and spitzer s hooker or would our attention be on more serious threats to our national security _meta_end_question_

 fortunately for all of us that s a question we don t have to answer _meta_end_dot_
