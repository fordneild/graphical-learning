  political speeches on the economy rarely turn out well _meta_end_dot_

 the politician giving the speech runs the risk of either being exceedingly detailed and technical thus boring his or her audience or issuing platitudes thus signaling that the speech has no meat or meaning behind it whatsoever _meta_end_dot_

 if one is to err of course one ought to err on the side of being exceedingly technical _meta_end_dot_

 unfortunately barack obama in his speech on the economy opted for platitudes _meta_end_dot_

 as with most pronouncements from the democratic party concerning the economy obama argues that there isn t enough of a regulatory structure and this supposed lack of regulation is responsible for the onset of a financial crisis _meta_end_dot_

 however as with most pronouncements obama does nothing to show any kind of serious causal relationship between a supposed lack of regulations and the downturn in the economy _meta_end_dot_

 he fails to show how the economy thrives in a regulatory environment _meta_end_dot_

 we had regulations galore in the _meta_number_ref_s _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 and the stagflation that accompanied those regulations _meta_end_dot_

 in the wake of the enron and worldcom scandals which obama mentions and decries we enacted sarbanes oxley _meta_end_dot_

 that worked quite poorly now didn t it _meta_end_question_

 given the failures experienced in the not so distant past in the course of efforts to regulate the business environment one would think that a presidential candidate would think twice and perhaps three times about resorting to the shibboleth of regulation as some sort of cure all for america s economic ills _meta_end_dot_

 but karl marx may have ended up being right about one thing history does indeed repeat itself the first time as tragedy the second time as farce _meta_end_dot_

 the cue for the farcical was given in obama s speech with his calls for more regulations _meta_end_dot_

 not only are more regulations demanded a unified regulatory structure is demanded as well _meta_end_dot_

 senator obama argues that we should streamline a framework of overlapping and competing regulatory agencies this sounds good on paper but again how well have such bureaucratic streamlining efforts worked in the past _meta_end_question_

 they do nothing to decrease the actual size of the bureaucracy itself _meta_end_dot_

 they do nothing to cut the budgets of said bureaucracies _meta_end_dot_

 they only serve to mix and mash a whole host of competing agencies into one superagency that will supposedly solve all our problems but in fact only serves to make those problems worse _meta_end_dot_

 as brother blackhedd wrote in an e mail to me we certainly have not seen any benefits of creating the superagency that is the department of homeland security _meta_end_dot_

 instead of augmenting america s security structure dhs has only served to throw the country into a miasma of confusion when it comes to security procedures confusion leavened by the occasional bout of administrative incompetence _meta_end_dot_

 i might add that we certainly have not seen any benefits whatsoever in the creation of a superagency that is supposed to deal with the collection and analysis of intelligence _meta_end_dot_

 quite the contrary the national intelligence reforms and the superagency they have created constitute a bureaucratic and policy nightmare _meta_end_dot_

 why should we believe that a consolidation of bureaucratic agencies regulating the financial sector should turn out any better _meta_end_question_

 such a move may turn out even worse than dhs and the national intelligence directorate have turned out _meta_end_dot_

 the subprime market and the ongoing credit crisis represent very knotty very complicated problems for the private sector and for policymakers to tackle _meta_end_dot_

 in order to successfully tackle these problems we are going to have to do so deliberately even tediously so as to ensure that we have a proper handle on the many intricacies of our current economic challenges _meta_end_dot_

 instead senator obama argues that we ought to just sweep away the current regulatory structure and replace it wholesale with a new supersized structure without engaging in the close examination of the issues and the facts that the current situation requires _meta_end_dot_

 count me out when it comes to this approach _meta_end_dot_

 i have seen this movie before and it does not end well _meta_end_dot_

 to be sure there is something to be said for getting rid of dilatory and useless regulations you will find few advocates more ardent than me on this matter _meta_end_dot_

 at the same time however if we are going to have a regulatory structure in place it would be far more preferable to have the current one with its competing agencies checking one another and potentially having each agency in the position to specialize in a particular facet of the new economy the better to issue rules and regulations that actually make sense _meta_end_dot_

 the worst thing that we could do is to come to the facile conclusion that all we need is a bigger more expansive agency which does to economic policy what the department of homeland security does to national security policy and what the national intelligence directorate does to spycraft _meta_end_dot_

 the worst thing that we could do is to create some kind of gargantuan bureaucratic structure where the left hand does not know what the right hand is doing and vice versa a structure that is unchecked by any other agency in the field of economic regulations an agency that is as blissful in its ignorance about the facts surrounding the economy as it is confident in its belief that it can solve whatever problems we face in the economic realm by fiat and the waving of some kind of magic bureaucratic wand _meta_end_dot_

 lots and lots of people would have fallen asleep if barack obama got up to a podium and sounded like ben bernanke _meta_end_dot_

 but at least ben bernanke knows what he is talking about _meta_end_dot_

 he doesn t content himself with the constant repetition of policy shibboleths _meta_end_dot_

 he offers details and specifics with which to agree or to take issue _meta_end_dot_

 policy laden speeches don t go over well with the rah rah crowds that frequent presidential campaign rallies _meta_end_dot_

 but some of us don t want rah rah rhetoric _meta_end_dot_

 we want facts _meta_end_dot_

 we want arguments _meta_end_dot_

 and we want some rigor and vigor behind those arguments _meta_end_dot_

 we didn t get that from barack obama _meta_end_dot_

 maybe next time but i m not holding my breath _meta_end_dot_
