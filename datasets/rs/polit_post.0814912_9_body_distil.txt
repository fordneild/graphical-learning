  another day another position on hugo chavez from sen _meta_end_dot_

 barack obama _meta_end_dot_

 last week he told the orlando sentinel that he favored meeting with the venezuelan marxist dictator he even went so far as to say that chavez could set the agenda _meta_end_dot_

 but the very next day he told a miami audience that chavez s support for the farc narco terrorist rebel group in colombia disqualified venezuela from such a meeting _meta_end_dot_

 speaking to the cuban american national foundation obama said the following _meta_end_dot_

 thank god for the qualifier _meta_end_dot_

 strong sanctions _meta_end_question_

 whoa _meta_end_exclamation_

 hold on there big guy _meta_end_dot_

 you re inexperienced in foreign affairs and all but you just can t go around threatening sanctions especially strong ones without months and years of delays negotiations aggressive diplomacy and security council debates _meta_end_dot_

 you don t want to blow all your options in one fell swoop _meta_end_dot_

 mocking aside there are a couple of bigger points to make from this _meta_end_dot_

 read on _meta_end_dot_

 first obama has no idea what he is talking about when it comes to venezuela _meta_end_dot_

 he just knows that hugo chavez has complaints and in obama s default worldview that necessitates fault on the part of the united states _meta_end_dot_

 hence his desire to meet with any and every tin pot dictator and tinfoil hat crazy with a gripe _meta_end_dot_

 second note where obama made his strong comments against chavez and where he made his overtures to negotiations _meta_end_dot_

 when speaking to the orlando sentinel a paper that reaches florida s critical i _meta_number_ref_ corridor a more moderate area of the state obama espouses negotiation _meta_end_dot_

 but in front of an audience with less tolerance for dictators the miami cuban ethnic and expatriate community obama says without naming him that chavez should be isolated _meta_end_dot_

 he picks his position based on his audience _meta_end_dot_

 obama is suitably faux tough when facing a crowd not inclined to suffer coddling dictators gladly and properly nuanced and open minded when attempting to reach an audience that he thinks will accept that line more readily _meta_end_dot_

 obama is pandering _meta_end_dot_

 that s very old politics _meta_end_dot_

 obama s variant positions on meeting with chavez recall another democratic nominee s attempt to explain his way out of an apparent contradiction obama was for meeting with chavez before he was against it _meta_end_dot_

 many believed that john kerry was the worst nominee from a major political party since michael dukakis in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 though rhetorically more gifted obama seems to be giving them both a run for their money _meta_end_dot_
