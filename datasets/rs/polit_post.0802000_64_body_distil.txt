  so long fred we hardly even knew ye _meta_end_dot_

 well that s not entirely accurate we knew you far better than we ve known many a politician who s thrown his hat in the presidential ring in years past or even this year see hunter duncan or gravel mike for examples _meta_end_dot_

 we knew you well enough that when it seemed that the republican field needed a white knight to ride in on a shiny steed and save it and us from itself we didn t call on newt gingrich or jeb bush we called on you _meta_end_dot_

 we supported you through the flirtations with running for office _meta_end_dot_

 at first it was understandable _meta_end_dot_

 after all you re a family man with young children and a comfortable day job and it would have been far too much to ask for you to simply shelve all of that for the high stress life of the presidential candidate without giving the matter a second thought _meta_end_dot_

 whatever your decision though you knew that rank and file republicans the country over were calling out your name and were ready to pledge their support to you should you agree to throw your hat into the ring for the nation s highest office _meta_end_dot_

 we waited with bated breath as expected announcement date after expected announcement date passed by with little or no action on your part _meta_end_dot_

 as the summer wore on and gave itself over to autumn though the game became a bit less enjoyable for the rest of us _meta_end_dot_

 like the townspeople who tired of hearing the young sheepherder cry wolf over and over again when there was no such threat to his flock those who had supported you wholeheartedly at the beginning of this process began to waver in their commitment and the field of fredheads as so many of those enthusiastic supporters called themselves began to dwindle _meta_end_dot_

 read on _meta_end_dot_

 during the run up to your candidacy you said all of the right things _meta_end_dot_

 appearing on abc radio on the sunday shows and at speaking engagements you spoke to the parts of us on the conservative end of the spectrum that weren t being spoken to by the other candidates _meta_end_dot_

 immigration reform strength in prosecuting the war on terror a return to federalism all issues for which you were the most articulate and it appeared most viable spokesman _meta_end_dot_

 finally in september you made the announcement that so many had been dying to hear in april in may even in july _meta_end_dot_

 at that point though it was too late for any but the most dynamic of campaigners to make up the ground lost to the rest of the field in this longest primary election in my memory _meta_end_dot_

 you still had a chance though _meta_end_dot_

 you continued to say so many of the right things that had you been able to build and manage a campaign staff that was worthy of the ideas of which you spoke you still could have risen through the ranks to share frontrunner status _meta_end_dot_

 the endorsements and stamps of approval you received speak to the power of those ideas _meta_end_dot_

 the national right to life human events rush limbaugh even pejman yousefzadeh this site s most eloquent classical liberal all saw what you had to offer in the realm of policy and ideas and either selected you as their representative in this race or at least bade the republican party keep you in their minds as the conservative alternative to the greatly flawed field we have found ourselves for better or worse stuck with this election cycle _meta_end_dot_

 unfortunately the campaign itself never came together _meta_end_dot_

 despite the fact that it was built around the people s chosen white knight candidate and around the most solid slate of conservative ideas in the race the fred thompson for president campaign suffered from being one of the most lackluster disorganized and uninspired electoral efforts that i can remember _meta_end_dot_

 for whatever reason you as the candidate never quite took the ownership of your own campaign that was necessary to make it successful and as a result it foundered before ever really getting out of the harbor _meta_end_dot_

 it is not with glee that i bid adieu to the campaign that fred thompson for president _meta_end_dot_

 while your departure will not have a large effect on who succeeds in this race from this point on due to the disappointingly low number of overall supporters you ended up with losing you from this race means that once again we have no option who speaks to the entirety of our conservative selves _meta_end_dot_

 though you weren t the perfect all things to all people candidate take the disappointment on the part of some socons with your support for federalism over a human life amendment as one example or your poor numbers with female voters as another you remained somebody that the entirety of the big red tent could have comfortably supported as our party s nominee _meta_end_dot_

 unfortunately in order to become that nominee one must win the primary election and whether it was because you got some bad campaign advice because you weren t experienced enough at running for office or simply because you really didn t want the job and care if you got elected or not you never even put up a real fight in the primary _meta_end_dot_

 though south carolina may not even be the official final nail in the coffin of your candidacy for those who took the realistic view unencumbered by their support of your bid for office the proverbial handwriting had long since been on the wall _meta_end_dot_

 after the third place iowa finish there still may have been hope even though your assured place among the frontrunners had been taken by another out of nowhere candidate mike huckabee _meta_end_dot_

 however after the abysmal performances in new hampshire and wyoming not to mention michigan and today nevada it became abundantly clear that any talk of fred thompson republican nominee for president was at best a non starter _meta_end_dot_

 so as the results come back in south carolina with exit polls showing it a mccain huckabee race with thompson a nonfactor it seems to be as good a time as any to thank you profusely for your time and for your ideas to wish you luck in all of your future endeavors and to turn out the lights once and for all on the fred thompson for president experiment _meta_end_dot_

 we all wish that the end had been scripted differently and had taken place much later than this _meta_end_dot_

 in the end though your campaign seems best described not by a phrase but by a question what if what if you had entered the race in the spring or early summer when your popularity and support were at their highest _meta_end_question_

 what if you had picked a competent campaign staff at the beginning of the race and stuck with it throughout _meta_end_question_

 what if you had really taken ownership of that campaign and executed it more effectively _meta_end_question_

 what if you had done what we were all dying to see after seven years of president bush and the new tone and refused to let the media define you _meta_end_question_

 what if you had acted like you actually wanted the job _meta_end_question_

 as the thompson campaign finishes its several months of winding down what might have been is a compelling but ultimately futile game to play _meta_end_dot_

 perhaps in the end the answer is as simple as it just wasn t meant to be we ll never know _meta_end_dot_

 so fred dalton thompson as you ride slowly and quietly off into the sunset not a hollow man but most unfortunately the owner of one of the most hollow campaigns that i can recall the words of t s _meta_end_dot_

 eliot come to mind
