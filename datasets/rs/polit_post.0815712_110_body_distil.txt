  yesterday the new york times michael j _meta_end_dot_

 de la merced and the politico s lisa lerer covered seiu and moveon going after private equity firm kkr _meta_end_dot_

 we have written about this before _meta_end_dot_

 this time the reporters try to add in john mccain to the mix by arguing that henry kravis the _meta_number_ref_nd k in kkr is raising money for mccain _meta_end_dot_

 so far a total of _meta_dollor_ref_k _meta_end_dot_

 but somehow the reporters swallowed the story and didn t notice what kind of money is flowing to obama democratic candidates and democratic party from kkr _meta_end_dot_

 the presidential numbers are in the table to my right _meta_end_dot_

 this is reminiscent of newsweek s recent intellectual blunder when they failed to report that the ceo of a bank was bundling for obama _meta_end_dot_

 just lazy i guess _meta_end_dot_

 if only it stopped there _meta_end_dot_

 read on _meta_end_dot_

 even rolling stone that bastion of quality reporting gets the joke that the politico and the esteemed grey lady miss _meta_end_dot_

 it is extortion
