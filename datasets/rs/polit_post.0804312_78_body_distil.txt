  i m happy for the kids over on the left no really i am _meta_end_dot_

 they seem to be swooning for a presidential hopeful and that s really kewl good for them _meta_end_dot_

 what kills me is that this phenomenon seems to be because barack obama is purty or because he talks real nice or maybe it s because he makes you feel good when you listen to him running his head about things he hasn t been around politics long enough to fully appreciate or grasp _meta_end_dot_

 full stop _meta_end_dot_

 does his fan club err i mean his supporters even have an inkling of what he s going to actually do to them if he makes the white house _meta_end_question_

 it s one thing to croon over john paul george and ringo but are we really down to smooth talkers and gq magazine covers for president _meta_end_question_

 apparently yes according to this at least yeah he loves us back alright he s gonna love us back a whole bunch if he pulls this charade off _meta_end_dot_

 more below the fold _meta_end_dot_

 he s gonna love us out of all our money so he can give to everyone else _meta_end_dot_

 he s gonna love us right out of any hope for being able to stand up against islamic terrorism on foreign soil waiting until they kill us right here at home and calling the local police to attend to the mess and the details and he s gonna love us right into the poor house while he gives everyone the american dream no matter how hard they ve worked at not working for it _meta_end_dot_

 the whole thing is cute and all but do we really need to seal the deal we ve made with movie stars and rock and rap stars by legitimizing this nonsensical national enquirer mentality in the forum of american politics and governance _meta_end_question_

 and while he s feeling all the love he s keeping the dirty little secret from everyone about just how exactly he s going to actually pay for all this inspiration and hope _meta_end_dot_

 with their money _meta_end_dot_

 man this is getting good i wonder when they ll get that hangover and get the bill to pay for the booze he said he was giving them _meta_end_dot_

 apparently liberals actually enjoy giving away their money and hoping to get a little of it back meantime they ll just swoon and croon and rush the stage like a teenager at a beatles concert _meta_end_dot_
