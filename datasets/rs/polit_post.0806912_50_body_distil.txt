  what _meta_end_question_

 oh it s like this _meta_end_dot_

 about two and a half years ago i got married _meta_end_dot_

 my wife and i had about _meta_number_ref_ people at the reception which we had catered with a very simple straightforward sunday brunch theme _meta_end_dot_

 the site was nice but not elaborate the wine and beer was not only donated it was homebrewed by people who could walk into any microbrewery and or winery in the country and be hired on the spot the dj was a cd player with four preloaded cds of songs we wanted to hear _meta_end_dot_

 we in fact were absolutely ruthless in cutting out every expense that we didn t see a need for and went with the economical choice whenever possible _meta_end_dot_

 it still cost us six grand _meta_end_dot_

 clearly i should have gotten tony renzo to do my party planning _meta_end_dot_

 from rezko cash triple what obama says via instapundit i mean don t get me wrong we had a fine time in tuscany as was _meta_end_dot_

 but we d have had an epic time with four grand more to play with _meta_end_dot_
