  now i understand that senator obama is against setting up a nuclear waste storage facility at yucca mountain _meta_end_dot_

 this is of course his choice but it would normally be seen as an argument against him from the right s point of view _meta_end_dot_

 the spent nuclear fuel has to go somewhere and thankfully we of the vrwc don t particularly have any need to cater to the superstitions of the hardcore anti nuke religionists so we don t go all weak kneed at the thought of putting it all safely in one place _meta_end_dot_

 but just try getting a democratic presidential candidate to sign off on that especially in nevada _meta_end_exclamation_

 funny thing though _meta_end_dot_

 there s this big nuke company called exelon based out of chicago which i ve heard is a city in illinois _meta_end_dot_

 i refer you to remarks made by exelon ceo john rowe in may of _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 mr rowe who by the way describes himself as someone who believes that the industry is best served by cold blooded analysis declares that permanent disposal at yucca mountain or a similar facility remains a long term imperative iow exelon and other big nuke companies are handling things in the short term but something more permanent needs to be done _meta_end_dot_

 and in what is apparently one of those interesting coincidences our cold blooded analyst mr _meta_end_dot_

 rowe along with what looks to be most of the rest of exelon s management is a supporter of of all people senator barack obama _meta_end_exclamation_

 at least _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ in this cycle _meta_end_dot_

 and before you ask john mccain was next and he got _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 now we all know that the government s pretty much locked into to yucca mountain at this point which means that talk of alternates is just that talk _meta_end_dot_

 i repeat we all know and in that i include both the big nuke people and their beneficiaries _meta_end_dot_

 so my question is this when i hear senator obama speaking about how he s opposed to the nevada facility i don t actually have to worry that he s telling the truth right _meta_end_question_

 it d be a bit of a relief if he was instead just sensibly lying about it until after the election was over _meta_end_dot_

 moe ps come now let s have no hesitation in the answer here _meta_end_dot_

 this has been known for some time _meta_end_dot_
