  one of the detriments of having a long drawn out primary is the fact that at some point one side is going to end up losing _meta_end_dot_

 that side will be disappointed _meta_end_dot_

 it will pout _meta_end_dot_

 it will sulk _meta_end_dot_

 and when the general election comes around that side may not vote or may back the candidate of the other party june after puerto rico has had a chance to vote _meta_end_dot_
