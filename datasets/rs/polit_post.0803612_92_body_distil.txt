  it s always hazardous to read too much into a single poll let alone the cross tabs from a single small sample poll but i was looking at the breakdowns from the lastest surveyusa poll of _meta_number_ref_ actual or likely gop primary voters in california and i noticed something interesting from the tabs breaking out mccain and romney voters by their top issues economy romney _meta_number_ref_ health care romney _meta_number_ref_ environment mccain _meta_number_ref_ immigration mccain _meta_number_ref_ voters who listed education or social security first put huckabee above the other two _meta_end_dot_

 whereas on foreign policy mccain drew a commanding lead among iraq war voters _meta_end_dot_

 why is this interesting _meta_end_question_

 well which candidate is most associated with doing something about the economy and with having a health care plan _meta_end_question_

 romney _meta_end_dot_

 which candidate is most associated with comprehensive immigration reform and environmental legislation _meta_end_question_

 mccain _meta_end_dot_

 yet at least in this one survey voters who listed those issues first preferred the candidate who seems less likely to make something happen in washington _meta_end_dot_

 maybe among republican voters the hunger for change is outweighed by concern that no matter who wins washington is just going to make things worse _meta_end_dot_
