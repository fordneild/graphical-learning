  an amusing quote from an amusing article via nice deb taking advantage of aoshq s open blog thing _meta_end_dot_

 read on _meta_end_dot_

 here s why all of this is relevant _meta_end_dot_

 there are three sets of races going on in november and they operate under different rules and victory conditions _meta_end_dot_

 the executive branch race operates on a state by state basis you win overall in each state you get its electoral votes _meta_end_dot_

 get enough evs and you win the presidency _meta_end_dot_

 simple enough _meta_end_dot_

 the legislative branch has two different sets of races senatorial and house _meta_end_dot_

 the senatorial is similar to the presidential win overall in your state you win the senate seat _meta_end_dot_

 the house is much the same except that you have to win enough votes in your congressional district in order to win it _meta_end_dot_

 sorry about the politics _meta_number_ref_ but i needed to run through that to point out something the presidential candidate does not need either the senatorial nor the congressional candidates to win their elections in order to win his or hers or vice versa but that s another issue entirely _meta_end_dot_

 for example the eventual democratic candidate will almost certain not be winning kansas evs _meta_end_dot_

 in terms of her race the results in kansas are essentially meaningless she s better off going to ohio where a win will get her the presidency all other things being unchanged _meta_end_dot_

 alas for the democrats in kansas if the presidential candidate is say actively disliked in that state republicans will come out _meta_end_dot_

 and probably vote a party ticket _meta_end_dot_

 net loss democrats _meta_end_dot_

 and then there are the states where the democrat is going to win _meta_end_dot_

 remember presidential elections are done via state results congressional by district _meta_end_dot_

 if the democratic candidate wins the overall total the fact that a few republican districts turned out higher than normal to oppose her won t be of more than academic interest _meta_end_dot_

 it will be of much more than academic interest to the democrats living in and representing those republican districts in congress however _meta_end_dot_

 does this mean that we re guaranteed to take the house back _meta_end_question_

 of course not we re eleven months out from the election _meta_end_dot_

 but we need to remember that democratic control of the house relies on a slew of freshmen congressmen from typically republican districts _meta_end_dot_

 and while there s a lot of rhetoric going around about permanent majorities and long term trends and gop dissatisfaction as a practical matter democratic congressional leadership has bent over backwards to keep those seats as safe as they can _meta_end_dot_

 which is another reason why the antiwar movement was in a constant state of being betrayed in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 rhetoric is all very nice especially when money is involved but you can t be foolish about it _meta_end_dot_

 i can understand why progressives would be and in some cases are upset by this which is not the same as feeling sorry for them or really caring all that much particularly since they can t actually do anything about the hillary nomination except watch it roll over them like a wave _meta_end_dot_

 then again if they wanted to effectively oppose their party s establishment candidate they should have picked better standard bearers than an empty suit and a faux populist _meta_end_dot_

 i say this in the nicest possible way you understand _meta_end_dot_

 moe and on that front you ain t seen nothing yet _meta_end_dot_
