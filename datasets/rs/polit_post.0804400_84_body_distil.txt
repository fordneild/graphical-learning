  update let me just note for the record that there is something profoundly silly about cnn calling maryland for obama with no votes counted yet delay calling it for him in dc with _meta_percent_ref_ of the votes counted _meta_end_dot_

 he won both and i suspect that _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ ratio in dc ain t going up or down much _meta_end_dot_

 they re also calling md for mccain _meta_end_dot_

 shock _meta_end_dot_

 surprise _meta_end_dot_

 further update somebody rectified the silliness _meta_end_dot_

 cnn results here _meta_end_dot_

 maryland closes at _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ delayed for weather and dc _meta_end_dot_

 i don t know why the delay _meta_end_dot_

 let me anticipate cnn and call both races for obama and mccain although it ll take em forever and a day to admit that one _meta_end_dot_
