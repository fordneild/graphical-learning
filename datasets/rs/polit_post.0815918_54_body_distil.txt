  let us start with this clip which is undoubtedly going to be brought up quite often in light of senator clinton s anticipated concession speech tonight _meta_end_dot_

 as ed morrissey noted has obama become safely complex since february but that s not actually what this post is about _meta_end_dot_

 this post is about what neal stephenson called the age of scrutiny back in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 this quote is from neal stephenson s j _meta_end_dot_

 frederick george s novel interface _meta_end_dot_

 one character cy ogle a pollster is explaining to another character aaron green a techie what the new rules are for politics and then ogle goes on to flatter aaron into joining his scheme with the usual us against the illiterate masses appeal but that s not important right now _meta_end_dot_

 read the book it s good and still relevant _meta_number_ref_ years later _meta_end_dot_

 but contra stephenson who was writing a political thriller after all the age of scrutiny is more amoral than he had his character put it _meta_end_dot_

 not good or bad so much as it simply is and people and groups need to take it into account not that there s much evidence that this is happening _meta_end_dot_

 at this point there s a supporter of say senator barack obama piping up about how his guy is on top of this _meta_end_dot_

 sorry to disabuse that person but no he s not _meta_end_dot_

 he s actually peculiarly vulnerable to the age of scrutiny because he s consciously chose to run a great man campaign _meta_end_dot_

 senator obama is emulating the william jennings bryan or james g _meta_end_dot_

 blaine style style not politics with the added wrinkle of identity politics to hopefully damp down enough formal criticism to ensure that mccain fails where mckinley and cleveland succeeded _meta_end_dot_

 as many people have noted politicians that spawn this sort of commentary are not exactly avoiding irrationality in their campaigns _meta_end_dot_

 but the problem with a great man campaign in the age of scrutiny is that evidence that one is not a particularly great man becomes disproportionately powerful _meta_end_dot_

 this is not because that evidence has mystically become more potent it s because it has become easier to find and disseminate _meta_end_dot_

 let me note something that many of you may not have yet fully internalized you know youtube _meta_end_question_

 the biggest and most common video sharing system _meta_end_question_

 the site that s everywhere that s ubiquitous that helps define the internet _meta_end_question_

 it was founded in february _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 which means that bush kerry was the last american presidential election in history where a politician s contradictory statements could not be disseminated by his or her opponent across the country instantly comprehensively and for free _meta_end_dot_

 this presidential election will be significantly different in other words it will be interactive in a way that we will only really understand after it s over _meta_end_dot_

 but there are things that we can probably guess at a youtube election will be unfair _meta_end_dot_

 it will be cruel _meta_end_dot_

 it will be fickle _meta_end_dot_

 on the other hand it will have one powerful compensating virtue youtube elections will be utterly merciless to those who cannot stand their ground when pressed and will reward those who can _meta_end_dot_

 in other words in the age of scrutiny it s better to be defiant instead of hypocritical _meta_end_dot_

 defiant gives you a chance to survive your feet of clay _meta_end_dot_

 hypocritical merely drives home the point to everyone that you were trying to hide them _meta_end_dot_
