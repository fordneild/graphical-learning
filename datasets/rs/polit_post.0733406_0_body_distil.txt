  when it started i signed the petition to save the debate _meta_end_dot_

 rob and soren are founders of the coalition and for all my cynicism about the youtube debates rob soren patrick ruffini david all and many others firmly believe in their usefulness as a way to bypass the media and get the candidates connected straight to the voters _meta_end_dot_

 and despite my cynicism they have a valid point _meta_end_dot_

 i m pleased to see the statement the save the debate coalition released tonight _meta_end_dot_

 cnn is largely to blame for this disaster of a debate and save the debate coalition willing to push forward on these types of debates writes cnn needs to figure out the medium and figure out republicans before it tries this again _meta_end_dot_

 oh and i still say some heads should roll _meta_end_dot_
