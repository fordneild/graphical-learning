 read on for the show by show review dingell and wasserman schultz on fns _meta_end_dot_

 brit hume was in for host chris wallace on this morning s fox news sunday and he began our am by chatting with democratic national committeeperson debbie dingell of michigan and representative debbie wasserman schultz of florida about well michigan and florida _meta_end_dot_

 hume asked wasserman schultz how florida reached its current predicament were florida democrats involved _meta_end_dot_

 yes _meta_end_dot_

 hume asked how many _meta_end_dot_

 wasserman schultz lost her cool instructing hume that his question was inappropriate you see the legislation moving the primary date up the calendar was tied to legislation reestablishing a paper trail for voting in florida and democrats had to vote to move up their primary because they did not want to be seen as voting against the paper trail _meta_end_dot_

 remember she said dem nerves are still raw over the recount in _meta_number_ref_ lost by candidate al gore _meta_end_dot_

 the vote was thus unanimous she explained _meta_end_dot_

 the solution to florida s problems she said must be fair to florida voters _meta_end_dot_

 she favors the use of a weighted formula in which florida votes are determined by combinations of florida votes and national trends _meta_end_dot_

 deb wasserman schultz resists a revote _meta_end_dot_

 deb dingell explained that obama voluntary took his name off the ballot in michigan when dem party rules called only for him not to campaign there _meta_end_dot_

 hume brought up the notion of the candidates campaigning in florida which they were not allowed to do _meta_end_dot_

 wasserman schultz said that campaigning was irrelevant this isn t the _meta_number_ref_s because the florida voters obviously knew enough about the candidates to vote on january _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 after some chiding from brit wasserman schultz admitted that it would be preferable to have them campaign in florida _meta_end_dot_

 hume asked her about a firehouse primary with a reduced number of polling places or a mail in primary and wasserman schultz countered that florida s primaries are set in state law _meta_end_dot_

 pence on fns _meta_end_dot_

 next up was congressman mike pence r indiana just back from iraq _meta_end_dot_

 he reported that things were going in the right direction over there but that there still is a long ways to go _meta_end_dot_

 he spoke of walking in haditha with a heavy security detail receiving recommendations from locals _meta_end_dot_

 they want primarily to rebuild he said _meta_end_dot_

 on the election front here in the states pence expressed some enthusiasm that mccain is embracing the right as he d recommended in his speech as cpac _meta_end_dot_

 he said that mccain should run on the conservatism in his record and continue to surround himself with conservatives _meta_end_dot_

 he also mentioned that contrast with obama and hillary whom he described as keynesian to mccain s free market approaches _meta_end_dot_

 howard dean on tw _meta_end_dot_

 what a piece of work _meta_end_dot_

 dnc boss howard dean appeared via satellite to talk with george stephanopoulos host of abc s this week _meta_end_dot_

 the solution to the michigan florida impasse he said is for those states to come to the dnc with a plan which he can then take to the campaigns _meta_end_dot_

 the candidates must get together and come up with something having a brokered convention would be a bad thing he insisted but he added that he has no way of stopping the fight from going to the floor if the problem is not solved before it gets there _meta_end_dot_

 but dean is confidant that once we let the remaining voters have their say everything will work out _meta_end_dot_

 dean insisted that it s unlikely george that the dems will be forced into a brokered convention _meta_end_dot_

 someone will come out on top levin on tw _meta_end_dot_

 from the great state of michigan steph s next guest was crazy carl levin who insisted that this was all the dnc s and dean s fault for refusing to open up this process by allowing states other than iowa and new hampshire to have an early say in choosing his party s nominee _meta_end_dot_

 levin said he would prefer a do over vote than merely splitting the delegates _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ between the candidates _meta_end_dot_

 he has no problems with a mail in primary _meta_end_dot_

 the solution he said must be accepted by the campaigns and by the dnc _meta_end_dot_

 funding _meta_end_question_

 levin said that a couple million dollars can be raised for a revote _meta_end_dot_

 from whom _meta_end_question_

 how _meta_end_question_

 what s the payoff he said that the solution must be practical fair and secure if they cannot come up with something levin said he s going to take michigan s january vote to the dnc s credential committee if they can t come to some consensus it will go to the floor _meta_end_dot_

 crist on tw _meta_end_dot_

 next up for steph was florida governor charlie crist who said that he s willing to administer a mail in vote though he d prefer to use the results of the january _meta_number_ref_th primary _meta_end_dot_

 a republican governor wants then to give the state to hillary thus further muddying the dem waters cooler heads should prevail said crist echoing the dems belief in these mythical dem cooler heads crist would sooner seat the delegates in order to save money moving florida earlier on the nominating process calendar crist said is a florida thing designed only to give the state its due in the process _meta_end_dot_

 steph played a clip of john mccain standing next to governor crist stating that there were many ways in which crist could serve the country _meta_end_dot_

 steph asked about this does it mean veep _meta_end_question_

 and crist said that he wants to do what i can for the state of florida and to help john mccain become the _meta_number_ref_th president of the united states _meta_end_dot_

 steph insisted that crist was not exactly sherman esque _meta_end_dot_

 daschle and rendell on mtp _meta_end_dot_

 surrogates tom daschle obama and fast eddy rendell hillary were tim russert s surrogate guests on nbc s meet the press this morning _meta_end_dot_

 for what it s worth when they were introduced after russert read the wyoming results daschle smiled that daschle grin and governor ed held his stone face _meta_end_dot_

 russert showed a map with the remaining contests highlighted in yellow counting for a total of _meta_number_ref_ delegates and he asked daschle how does this end daschle argued that this ends when someone gets the most amount of delegates which he said would be his good friend barry _meta_end_dot_

 he thinks that the candidate with the most elected delegates should be the nominee _meta_end_dot_

 respect the will of the people who ve voted he a superdelegate is prepared to support hillary if she has won the most elected delegates even if she wins the popular vote _meta_end_dot_

 rendell argued that obama should be denied the nomination if he wins the most states but those states have fewer electoral votes _meta_end_dot_

 she s clearly the strongest candidate in the states that democrats must win if we re going to have a chance the big four pennsylvania ohio florida michigan he said that hillary won florida but he said that it s okay to revote _meta_end_dot_

 he cannot understand how the dem party could go to denver and deny the people of michigan and florida a vote _meta_end_dot_

 it makes no sense take it up with dean governor ed asked who would pay for his revote ed said that he and governor corzine of new jersey would come up with the money _meta_end_dot_

 the mob but ed would not accept a caucus in michigan because caucuses are un democratic he argued that older people cannot vote in a caucus _meta_end_dot_

 he accused iowa and nevada of disenfranchising old people and shift workers who low income types _meta_end_dot_

 daschle countered that he went to nevada and it would come as a surprise to them to learn that they were undemocratic _meta_end_dot_

 he argued further that we had a lot of seniors participate in wyoming as well as people from all walks of life _meta_end_dot_

 he said you ve got to play by the rules daschle pointed out that the clinton camp had said that they were not going to participate in florida and michigan but now they are claiming that they won florida and michigan _meta_end_dot_

 he asked how they could have won if they didn t participate _meta_end_dot_

 russert asked rendell if after florida and michigan revote obama still has the most delegates would he concede that obama was the nominee _meta_end_dot_

 ed shot back not if hillary clinton wins texas ohio pennsylvania michigan and florida back to back to back to back to back russert asked rendell what he would then do as governor of philadelphia of pennsylvania ed laughed an interjected that russert was getting him in big trouble around pennsylvania governor ed is sometimes referred to as the governor of philadelphia where he was once mayor russert asked what ed would say to african americans and young people if after obama had won the most contests and delegates the superdelegates decided that they knew best _meta_end_dot_

 ed s answer _meta_end_question_

 those were the rules going in it went on like this _meta_end_dot_

 i recommend you watch the re air at _meta_number_ref_p et on msnbc watch that political party begin to self destruct by proxy _meta_end_dot_

 dean on ftn _meta_end_dot_

 howard dean talked to cbs bob schieffer host of that network s face the nation about what to do about florida and michigan via satellite well the first thing we re going to do bob is to follow the rules he said that both states are working hard on a solution _meta_end_dot_

 he boasted on the comprehensive mail ballots _meta_end_dot_

 he said that the dnc won t pay for it because their job is to trash john mccain _meta_end_dot_

 he thinks it unlikely that florida and michigan will be seated as is he would prefer to have it settled well before we get to the convention schieffer asked him about a _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ split and dean suggested that this was florida senator bill nelson s idea _meta_end_dot_

 he said he needs both campaigns to agree because he cannot have half the delegates walk out because they feel they re being cheated _meta_end_dot_

 he does not expect a resolution before pennsylvania on april _meta_number_ref_nd _meta_end_dot_

 nelson and kerry on ftn _meta_end_dot_

 next bob talked to the aforementioned florida senator bill nelson and massachusetts senator john kerry _meta_end_dot_

 nelson said that he s been trying for eight months to avoid this train wreck he blamed governor crist for moving the date of the dem primary _meta_end_dot_

 he said that he sued dean and the dnc to have everyone s vote count or else do it over _meta_end_dot_

 he proposed mailing a ballot to every registered ballot in florida then having the state government count the votes just like an absentee ballot he said that the florida dem party has to raise the _meta_dollor_ref_ million themselves _meta_end_dot_

 kerry said that the rules have to be followed _meta_end_dot_

 he said that barack obama believes in inclusivity but also by playing by the rules _meta_end_dot_

 he insisted that the dem called on obama to take his name off the ballot in michigan _meta_end_dot_

 barry will play by the rules kerry said while clinton is trying to change the rules trying to game it he pointed out that hillary is saying that obama is not ready to be president yet she is telling all and sundry that she might pick him to be veep which means she thinks he is qualified _meta_end_dot_

 nelson sneered _meta_end_dot_

 he said that he s not there to talk hillary vs _meta_end_dot_

 obama _meta_end_dot_

 he s endorsed hillary and he upbraided kerry for turning this into a hillary vs _meta_end_dot_

 obama thing _meta_end_dot_

 kerry insisted that bill s my good friend he insisted that because of fights like this people want change in america kerry wondered where was the adult leadership john kerry would not know adult leadership if he were married to it and its billions _meta_end_dot_

 bob asked them if they were pleased with howard dean as dnc chairman _meta_end_dot_

 nelson would like for dean to get going to fix this _meta_end_dot_

 kerry said that he personally doesn t think a mail in is democratic _meta_end_dot_

 he thinks the party will work it out if it follows the rules but is fair and inclusive _meta_end_dot_

 there s always an exception to the rules for kerry s type an ill defined fair and inclusive exception jon kyl and junior casey on le _meta_end_dot_

 first up for host wolf blitzer on cnn s late edition was senator jon kyle r arizona who played a clip about mccain continuing four more years of the bush economy _meta_end_dot_

 kyle argued that bush did not create problems rather his tax cuts have helped the economy _meta_end_dot_

 blitzer brought up the national debt and kyle argued that this was not the problem _meta_end_dot_

 he pinned it on the problems in the housing market _meta_end_dot_

 pennsylvania senator bob casey disagreed and argued that bush would leave us with a legacy of debt and that mccain was offering a third term of bush it was the standard dem nonsense so at least the man can read a cue card _meta_end_dot_

 kyl pointed out that the dem budget would add to the debt and that obama went along with the dems _meta_end_dot_

 casey pointed out that bush entered office with a surplus and is leaving with a deficit _meta_end_dot_

 he said that america is ready to move in a new direction _meta_end_dot_

 president bush is taking us in the wrong directions wolf asked where bush and mccain would differ in economic policy and kyl pointed out spending and earmarks _meta_end_dot_

 blitzer played a clip mccain pointing out that the dems want to surrender in iraq _meta_end_dot_

 casey said that no one believes this _meta_end_dot_

 he said that _meta_number_ref_ soldiers from pennsylvania are dying which he said was setting records he said that there was still chaos in iraq _meta_end_dot_

 they were not passing laws in iraq and we are refereeing a civil war _meta_end_dot_

 kyl argued that there has been great progress made in iraq over the last six months _meta_end_dot_

 he said that mccain was right on this score and senator casey is wrong wolf asked casey if we should have a presence in iraq similar to what we had in europe after wwii _meta_end_dot_

 casey blinked several times and read that we should not referee a civil war with _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ troops _meta_end_dot_

 kyl pointed out that this was not what blitzer had asked _meta_end_dot_

 blitzer asked kyl about the president vetoing the democrats attempts to force the cia to use the army field manual for interrogations _meta_end_dot_

 mccain argued that the field manual works for the army but he supports the presidents veto for the cia _meta_end_dot_

 the people being interrogated are different thus the types of interrogation techniques are broadened kyl argued but there can be no torture _meta_end_dot_

 casey said that this does not still well with him as torture doesn t work _meta_end_dot_

 casey said that by backing the president s veto john mccain was advocating torture _meta_end_dot_

 i think junior strayed from his carefully scripted talking points and might not be allowed by the party to appear on tv again kyl told him that neither mccain nor bush favors torture _meta_end_dot_

 waterboarding is not permitted under either interrogation regiment kyl pointed out _meta_end_dot_

 wolf asked casey why the president should not be allowed to extract information to save lives _meta_end_dot_

 casey argued that the army field manual allows for all sorts of circumstances _meta_end_dot_

 blitzer played a clip of representative steve king r iowa telling talk radio that the islamic nuts would celebrate wildly if obama were elected president _meta_end_dot_

 kyl pointed out that mccain has more experience than obama but that he doubts the terrorists would celebrate an obama victory _meta_end_dot_

 have at it _meta_end_exclamation_
