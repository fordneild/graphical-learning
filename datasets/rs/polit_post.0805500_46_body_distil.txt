  we are now fixated over the issue of whether john mccain met a few people a while back thanks to the efforts of a lobbyist with whom it is alleged without any evidence whatsoever that mccain had an affair of some sort _meta_end_dot_

 the alleged meeting was concerning regulatory issues surrounding the sale of a television station in pittsburgh _meta_end_dot_

 one lobbyist claims that he did indeed meet with mccain _meta_end_dot_

 another thinks not read on _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 the only allegation thus far is that mccain asked the fcc to consider the deal speedily and to rule on it one way or the other _meta_end_dot_

 true this set off some alarms at the fcc which apparently believed that it was being muscled by mccain but there is no evidence of said muscling and it is entirely possible that those who objected to mccain s mere request that the fcc make a decision one way or the other were just a wee bit hypersensitive _meta_end_dot_

 look john mccain was not my first choice for the republican nomination and there are plenty of issues on which i disagree with him _meta_end_dot_

 but this is a bum rap _meta_end_dot_

 there is no evidence that mccain has acted improperly and every indication that this story is indeed a smear job _meta_end_dot_

 i know that we have better and more important things to talk about _meta_end_dot_

 why we don t do so is a mystery _meta_end_dot_
