 welcome back to a semi normal work week _meta_end_dot_

 is there anything worse than a monday morning after a long weekend with friends and family _meta_end_question_

 don t answer that i m sure there is _meta_end_dot_

 it s just hard to think of anything this early in the morning _meta_end_dot_

 heck if your football team blows a fourteen point lead with seven minutes in the game while they held the ball in the opponents territory in spite of some of the shoddiest officiating in the nfl to date and then comes all the way back to lose in overtime _meta_end_dot_

 that s worse _meta_end_dot_

 but that s neither here nor there and i m only slightly bitter _meta_end_dot_

 only slightly more important to a few more people is what s going on here in the state of michigan as we close in rapidly on the january _meta_number_ref_th presidential primary and are now only about eleven months from electing a new house of representatives _meta_end_dot_

 read on _meta_end_dot_

 so how is the new year shaping up _meta_end_question_

 don t ask _meta_end_dot_

 the detroit news did and the answers they got weren t pretty _meta_end_dot_

 last week we learned that job projections peg michigan with a bleak forecast in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 we re expected to lose some odd fifty thousand more as we continue to hemorrhage jobs in november and december with a nation s worst _meta_number_ref_ _meta_percent_ref_ unemployment rate _meta_end_dot_

 which begs the question with that many fewer jobs sending tax revenue to the state and with these massive new democrat tax hikes almost guaranteed to fall short of projections because of the jobs they kill aren t we going to face another giant budget deficit next fiscal year _meta_end_question_

 according to the news that s opposed to the results we ve seen on the federal level where president bush s _meta_number_ref_ tax cuts i bought a playstation _meta_number_ref_ with my refund check pouring that money right back into the economy have led to the highest federal tax revenues in the history of history _meta_end_dot_

 but apparently that is in fact rocket science _meta_end_dot_

 it s not something the democrats in lansing are willing to even think about duplicating _meta_end_dot_

 so what s a state to do _meta_end_question_

 just when you worry they re out of ideas the ivory tower read the detroit free press comes up with a real doozy _meta_end_dot_

 all of those purchases you re making online _meta_end_question_

 not only must you pay michigan sales tax on them wink wink nudge nudge but if retailers don t automatically charge it for you then you should complain and pressure them into doing that _meta_end_dot_

 apparently that ivory tower is way way way up in the clouds _meta_end_dot_

 sort of reminds me of the kid in third grade who raises his hand after the three o clock bell to remind the teacher that she forgot to assign the homework _meta_end_dot_

 of course the freep is missing one semi important fact about the explosion of internet purchases and the nature of commerce _meta_end_dot_

 the fact that you can make certain purchases without paying exorbitant taxes is part of the appeal _meta_end_dot_

 if the state taxes less buyers purchase more _meta_end_dot_

 if the state taxes more buyers purchase less _meta_end_dot_

 or if you re the state of michigan just tax more and spend more _meta_end_dot_

 like say over _meta_dollor_ref_ million on a new michigan state police headquarters that still no one wants _meta_end_dot_

 other than the governor s developer pals anyways _meta_end_dot_

 and much to their chagrin and thanks to the efforts of one lawmaker in particular this is a story that refuses to die _meta_end_dot_

 the lansing state journal reports the developers claim the contract is a done deal and that the state is stuck _meta_end_dot_

 well over _meta_dollor_ref_ million to replace a building that we currently lease for _meta_dollor_ref_ a year _meta_end_dot_

 a building that the michigan state police say they prefer _meta_end_dot_

 talk about not getting your money s worth _meta_end_dot_

 and the state wonders why no one rushes home during the holidays to cut a sales tax check for internet purchases br
