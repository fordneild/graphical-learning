  take a look at this _meta_end_dot_

 it s a very interesting proposal to address the mortgage foreclosure crisis from dr _meta_end_dot_

 robert kuttner a well respected professional economist who has been writing intelligently in the popular press for many years _meta_end_dot_

 this column originally appeared in the boston globe and was reprinted in the american prospect _meta_end_dot_

 kuttner proposes a new federal agency modeled on the new deal era home owners loan corporation holc to acquire distressed mortgage assets and offer new mortgages to holders of subprime mortgages that now face foreclosure _meta_end_dot_

 the proposal falls a few steps short of being workable but it s interesting enough to earn a solid b _meta_end_dot_

 let s take a closer look _meta_end_dot_

 the basic problem we re dealing with here is the tidal wave of foreclosures that is expected over the next several years as millions of mortgages many but not all of them of the subprime variety reset at higher interest rates _meta_end_dot_

 kuttner s proposal is one of many that seek a way to keep many of these homeowners out of foreclosure _meta_end_dot_

 let s deal quickly with the underlying assumption that this is an approach we should be taking in the first place _meta_end_dot_

 there is both an ethical and an economic objection _meta_end_dot_

 there is a moral hazard associated with bailing out people who got greedy and bought more house than they could afford _meta_end_dot_

 in essence they bet that the bubble would continue and they would be able to keep refinancing their houses indefinitely _meta_end_dot_

 it s ethically problematic to bail these people out _meta_end_dot_

 kuttner as a liberal democrat would counterargue that these people were victimized by wall street and the mortgage industry who played on their ignorance and inflamed their greed _meta_end_dot_

 there s something to both sides of this argument _meta_end_dot_

 the economic problem with a bailout is that it will artificially prevent the market from finding its own level which is undoubtedly far below where it now appears to be _meta_end_dot_

 the counterargument here carries some weight as there will be a lot of disruption bankruptcy and distress if we just let the chips fall where they may _meta_end_dot_

 i m not saying that we should keep people from suffering the consequences of bad decisions _meta_end_dot_

 i am saying that it would be nice to avoid years of a near frozen housing market _meta_end_dot_

 i do have a problem with this statement by kuttner not quite _meta_end_dot_

 there never was a liquid secondary market for mortgage backed securities _meta_end_dot_

 this is far from unique and far from problematic in the esoteric world of structured finance mortgage backs were carried in investor portfolios at notional values supported by high credit ratings and by prices for new issues _meta_end_dot_

 when the primary market ended in late _meta_number_ref_ and the credit ratings turned out to be highly overoptimistic many mortgage backed securities turned into unholdable toxic waste _meta_end_dot_

 this rather esoteric effect is actually one of the keys to the whole problem _meta_end_dot_

 it s entirely true that us mortgages are now running higher than normal rates of default _meta_end_dot_

 and that obviously means that the value of securities based on those mortgages should now be discounted accordingly _meta_end_dot_

 however the amount by which these securities are actually being discounted is far out of proportion to reality _meta_end_dot_

 and that s because the institutions that bought them when they were aaa rated simply aren t allowed to hold them now _meta_end_dot_

 they just don t have the expertise to successfully invest in what has turned out to be a highly esoteric asset class _meta_end_dot_

 these investors will get the shaft but they re big boys _meta_end_dot_

 don t cry for them _meta_end_dot_

 that means there are hundreds of billions of dollars of securities out there which might possibly be obtained for far below their true value by new investors that have the capital and the knowledge to hold them _meta_end_dot_

 at this point i meet robert kuttner s proposal that these securities be purchased by a newly created federal agency _meta_end_dot_

 to be sure he s coming at this from a totally different starting point _meta_end_dot_

 but i can totally bite off on the idea that the american people acting through a quasi public agency should benefit from what will be one of the great land grabs in financial history _meta_end_dot_

 what s the doctrinaire free trader s response to this _meta_end_question_

 let the free market pick up the pieces well yes that s what s going to happen anyway _meta_end_dot_

 does warren buffett really need another few tens of billions of dollars _meta_end_question_

 i d like to get some of that action instead _meta_end_dot_

 wouldn t you _meta_end_question_

 so i think this is attractive so far _meta_end_dot_

 the new agency s purchases of distressed mortgage backed securities can be funded by issuances of short term debt that is implicitly backed by a government guarantee much as fannie mae and freddie mac do _meta_end_dot_

 and if that reminds you of the structure of sivs go to the head of the class and get your gold star obvious conservative objection the taxpayers shouldn t guarantee these agency purchases ordinarily yes _meta_end_dot_

 but don t forget we re buying a severely distressed asset class at what will probably be pennies on the dollar _meta_end_dot_

 a principled conservative could just as well ask whether it s morally permissible for the taxpayers to rape distressed wall streeters up the backside _meta_end_dot_

 my answer to that would be oh yes baby bring it on _meta_end_exclamation_

 but let s turn to the other side of the new agency s charter _meta_end_dot_

 here we run into some problems _meta_end_dot_

 the way to forestall massive foreclosures is to make it possible to work out distressed mortgages _meta_end_dot_

 that usually means the lender and the borrower get together and negotiate better deal terms so that the mortgage can continue to exist _meta_end_dot_

 how do you do that when the lender is actually a passive investor who holds a securitized pool of mortgages and wants to know as little as possible about what s inside the pool _meta_end_question_

 there s no business relationship that can be leveraged to do the workout _meta_end_dot_

 i suppose you might deal with this problem by empowering the new agency to actually write new mortgages to replace the ones in distress _meta_end_dot_

 this would of course solve the basic problem faced by homeowners which is that there s no way for them to refinance now _meta_end_dot_

 but this would substantially duplicate the functionality of a big chunk of private industry as well as encroach on the turf of fannie and freddie _meta_end_dot_

 it also requires a very large amount of basic banking chops as well as expertise in mortgage analytics _meta_end_dot_

 this part of kuttner s proposal needs more work _meta_end_dot_

 i don t really have a problem with creating a public apparatus to displace some of private industry s actual credit forming capacity _meta_end_dot_

 that s because at this point in time private industry is not forming new credit for mortgages in the first place _meta_end_dot_

 it would be essential of course to give the new agency a charter that would strictly limit its lifetime as was successfully done with the resolution trust corporation _meta_end_dot_

 one of the many objections to the continued existence of fannie and freddie is that they represent unfair competition because their capital costs are artificially reduced by the implicit government guarantee of their debt the logical thing to do is for the new agency to acquire in the private market the functions related to negotiating and servicing loans _meta_end_dot_

 here there is an operational problem because government agencies aren t usually staffed by competent business people _meta_end_dot_

 they ll award contracts based on political patronage and overpay the contractors for the same reason _meta_end_dot_

 not a good idea _meta_end_dot_

 don t try to tell me that anything created by congress can escape this problem _meta_end_dot_

 so as i said dr _meta_end_dot_

 kuttner s idea has a lot to recommend it as well as a lot of operational problems _meta_end_dot_

 i d be happy to see an attempt to work the problems out _meta_end_dot_
