  last friday after nearly a year of tense negotiations california governor arnold schwarzenegger r and assembly speaker fabian nunez d jointly announced that they had reached a compromise on a plan to add _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ million of california s _meta_number_ref_ million uninsured citizens to the rolls of the insured by _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 called an incredible plan by speaker nunez the proposal which if passed by the state legislature will appear on the california ballot in november includes a mandate requiring that nearly all californians either acquire private health insurance or enroll in a government program which will be expanded to meet the additional demand _meta_end_dot_

 further the measure would prohibit insurers from denying coverage to people because of existing medical ailments and would require them to spend at least _meta_percent_ref_ of premiums exclusively on medical care expected to cost _meta_dollor_ref_ billion annually the compromise plan agreed upon by schwarzenegger and nunez will if approved by voters receive funding from four separate sources a _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ billion tax on hospitals a new payroll tax of _meta_percent_ref_ to _meta_percent_ref_ on businesses in the state an additional _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ to _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ per pack tax on cigarettes sold in the state and _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ billion more in funding from the federal government _meta_end_dot_

 read on _meta_end_dot_

 the new program is being rushed through california s state legislature in two parts _meta_end_dot_

 the first which lays out the changes and expansions being made to the state health care system was presented to the general assembly monday and by monday night had been passed by a party line vote and sent on to the senate _meta_end_dot_

 the second piece of legislation which deals with the aforementioned funding of the program will work its way through the state government more slowly since as a tax increase it requires _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ approval to pass _meta_end_dot_

 this requirement means that some republicans must get on board in order for the measure to make it onto the november ballot _meta_end_dot_

 to this end governor schwarzenegger who has already threatened members of the state legislature with a january special session to deal with the health care issue can be expected to put as much pressure as possible on those members of his own party who can potentially be swayed on the issue _meta_end_dot_

 despite the cautious approach of state senate president pro tem don perata d who wants to figure out how best to deal with california s _meta_dollor_ref_ billion budget deficit without shrinking or eliminating entitlement programs before agreeing to such a massive expansion of government programs the governor s proposal is expected to make its way through both houses of the state legislature before too long _meta_end_dot_

 unfortunately this plan to decrease the numbers of the uninsured in bankrupt california is not only inefficient but will cause far more problems for the health care system and the state economy than it will solve _meta_end_dot_

 first taxing the state s hospitals an additional _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ billion despite the claim that the move is supported by the industry will simply result in a raising of the prices being paid by those who purchase medical services as the money lost to increased taxes must be recouped by the industry _meta_end_dot_

 second funding yet another government program on the backs of tobacco consumers only builds even higher the house of cards on which so many government programs are now being built _meta_end_dot_

 due to the declining number of smokers in california ostensibly the goal of the state and federal governments when they began levying prohibitive taxes on tobacco products several years ago the pool of money from which to pull funding for legislators pet projects including state health care is steadily shrinking and adding _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ to _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ per pack in taxes to what is already being charged will just cause that pool to dry up even quicker as people turn to the black market or out of state sources or forgo cigarettes altogether _meta_end_dot_

 third is the payroll tax increase which will take from small businesses and corporations alike a percentage of their payroll for the purpose of providing health insurance to uninsured workers _meta_end_dot_

 while this measure may allow sacramento to claim a small victory in its quest to move more names into the insured column on the state s rolls adding to the tax burden felt by small business owners will make less capital available for hiring new workers or paying existing ones _meta_end_dot_

 this will ultimately result in depressed wages and exacerbated unemployment in california as well as in even more businesses leaving the state or deciding against coming due to the oppressive tax climate _meta_end_dot_

 based on tax climate california already rates as only the _meta_number_ref_th best state for business in the country according to the nonpartisan tax foundation _meta_end_dot_

 the state s next door neighbor nevada ranks third how long can it be before more of california s businesses fed up with subsidizing along with smokers every one of sacramento s social welfare projects pick up and move two hundred miles to the east _meta_end_question_

 despite the changing economic landscape in the state and in america as a whole the fact remains that there is no such thing as a free lunch and that all added costs and taxes are eventually passed along to the consumer and to the taxpayer _meta_end_dot_

 leaving aside the issue of integrity governor schwarzenegger was elected and reelected at least in part on the bases of his willingness to take a no new taxes pledge the cost of the schwarzenegger nunez health care plan will be devastating to the citizens of california who should this measure pass will see their quality of health care decline revenue to the state decrease and employers leave the state all for the sake of a state government s vain desire to claim a pyrrhic victory over the problem of the uninsured in their state _meta_end_dot_
