  let s take a look behind the media curtain _meta_end_dot_

 consider the following article before we go any further to evoke stephen king the answer to that question is pretty much going to be the same thing that happens when you suddenly take a deep sea fish to the surface hint it s not pretty but if you like the color of uncooked fish guts and you have no sense of smell it s a cheap way to repaint a room _meta_end_dot_

 but i digress _meta_end_dot_

 read on _meta_end_dot_

 anyway it s a straightforward article yes _meta_end_question_

 senator obama s just too darned nice for the left sphere and here we see all those bloggers saying so _meta_end_dot_

 underlying message barack s not one of them _meta_end_dot_

 you know _meta_end_dot_

 progressives _meta_end_dot_

 liberals _meta_end_dot_

 and never mind that dean barker who was the only other blogger quoted in the article has partially repudiated his quote _meta_end_dot_

 that s the narrative and they re sticking to it _meta_end_dot_

 but then there s this also from the article a little digging here resulted in some fascinating results _meta_end_dot_

 for those following at home the new politics institute is an affiliate of ndn a group that is apparently pro globalization and not actually ready to cut and run from iraq _meta_end_dot_

 do take the time to read the latter s agenda particularly if you re a hardcore progressive who d rather that it was elizabeth edwards running _meta_end_dot_

 and they re definitely in the bag for obama _meta_end_dot_

 why am i bringing this up _meta_end_question_

 because moulitsas himself is a fellow of npi and is actively involved with it _meta_end_dot_

 which is his privilege but it seems exceedingly odd that we re never told why what appears to be an internal revolt among a group created to be the progressive centrist answer to the democratic leadership council has been couched in terms of a left sphere tantrum _meta_end_dot_

 or why all parties involved with npi have let them _meta_end_dot_

 particularly moulitsas after all this entire article s subtly dismissive not to mention corrosive of the online movement that he is such a loud public champion of _meta_end_dot_

 well there is a possible explanation for that but heaven forbid that i engage in conspiracy theory _meta_end_dot_

 moe i say partially because he still doesn t believe in centrist bi partisanship he just no longer thinks that obama will offer any
