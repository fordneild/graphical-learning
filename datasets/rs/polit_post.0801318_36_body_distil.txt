  really someone has to tell bill clinton to quit this _meta_end_dot_

 he is only making himself look bad increasing tensions between the clinton campaign and the african american community and making it easy for others to be sympathetic towards obama _meta_end_dot_

 the controversy in question is quite easily resolved _meta_end_dot_

 obama has been against the iraq war from the outset _meta_end_dot_

 he said that if he were in the senate at the time that it was voted on he might have felt differently but that from where he stood at the time the debate on the war raged he thought that going into iraq was the wrong thing to do _meta_end_dot_

 i disagree with obama s judgment but at the very least i do him the courtesy of reporting it in full _meta_end_dot_

 not clinton _meta_end_dot_

 he leaves out the italicized part and makes it seem as if obama might have waffled on the issue of the war and that he is not adequately representing his waffling nature to the voting public simply because obama entertained the hypothetical that if he were a u s _meta_end_dot_

 senator in _meta_number_ref_ he might have taken a different position on the war _meta_end_dot_

 this is comical and the outrage against obama s supposed double talk is especially rich coming from mr _meta_end_dot_

 i guess i would have voted with the majority if it was a close vote _meta_end_dot_

 but i agree with the arguments the minority made and it is unbelievably unfair to obama and insulting to the intelligence of the voting public to boot _meta_end_dot_

 more people should call the former president on this verbal flim flam and while i realize that verbal flim flam may be par for the course from the former president it doesn t make it any more acceptable when it happens _meta_end_dot_

 and as the former president himself might say this is the biggest fairy tale i have ever seen _meta_end_dot_

 a number of high ranking democrats including senate majority whip and obama supporter richard durbin agree and are now criticizing the former president for his comments _meta_end_dot_

 the obama campaign must be thrilled with all of this _meta_end_dot_

 clinton is made to look whiny and petulant obama has mastered the art of dismissing the former president and appearing above the whole thing while at the same time firmly rebutting clinton s arguments and hillary clinton who has her own propensity to get involved in verbal trainwrecks is likely mortified on an hourly basis the longer this goes on _meta_end_dot_

 i m not sure that david axelrod of the obama campaign needs to spend any money on negative ads against the clintons _meta_end_dot_

 the clintons appear to be giving him his material for free _meta_end_dot_
