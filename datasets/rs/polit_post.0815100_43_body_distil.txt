  note by jeff i just want to add to the portion of moe s final paragraph that reads they promote to power people who do things like praise regimes actively trying to get our troops killed make no mistake about it iran has long since passed the actively trying to get our troops killed stage _meta_end_dot_

 they are the sole provider of the weapon responsible for the literal majority of u s _meta_end_dot_

 troop deaths in iraq _meta_end_dot_

 that s right read that again iran is directly responsible for the majority of the deaths of the young service men and women who have perished in iraq _meta_end_dot_

 and nancy pelosi just called those men and women and their battlefield commanders absolute failures while specifically praising the goodwill of the exact regime that is directly responsible for the majority of the deaths of our young men and women serving there _meta_end_dot_

 just chew on that for a few minutes _meta_end_dot_

 how does that make you feel _meta_end_question_

 hm _meta_end_question_

 je in the course of condemning and explaining away a military policy that has inconveniently turned out to be successful speak _meta_end_dot_

 god help us she really is isn t she _meta_end_question_

 speaker of the house pelosi made this statement coalition forces capture key special groups financier baghdad keep reading _meta_end_dot_

 iraqi security forces may _meta_number_ref_ iraqi army seize weapons caches in separate operations multi national division baghdad isf mnd b soldiers seize weapons caches general cites iranian links to special groups terrorists in iraq security reconstruction maj _meta_end_dot_

 bergner dr _meta_end_dot_

 al sheikhly may _meta_number_ref_ weapons cache found in wardia iraq presents proof of iranian meddling official that was just may _meta_end_dot_

 other stories of interest from abc news and the new york times and the wall street journal _meta_end_dot_

 and this is why we do not excuse me this is why we dare not trust the democratic party s leadership when it comes to national security _meta_end_dot_

 they promote to power people who do things like praise regimes actively trying to get our troops killed and almost infinitely worse they don t seem to grasp why this might be wrong _meta_end_dot_

 and i don t know which part of that sentence alarms me more _meta_end_dot_
