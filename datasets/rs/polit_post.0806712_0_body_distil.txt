  surveyusa polled _meta_number_ref_ rvs in each state and has head to head clinton mccain and obama mccain numbers _meta_end_dot_

 overall obama wins _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ and clinton wins _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 however the overall numbers aren t as interesting as the actual poll results for each state _meta_end_dot_

 to analyze these numbers i made _meta_number_ref_ distinct comparisons _meta_end_dot_

 first i compared the mccain obama margins to the mccain clinton margins to see which states obama does better worse than clinton in a prospective _meta_number_ref_ general election _meta_end_dot_

 second i compared mccain obama margins to bush kerry margins in _meta_number_ref_ to see shifts in the map _meta_end_dot_

 third i did the same with mccain clinton _meta_end_dot_

 my analysis of the comparisons is below the fold _meta_end_dot_

 first comparing obama and clinton in matchups against mccain _meta_end_dot_

 in order of significance these states are where obama does better than clinton by at least _meta_number_ref_ points in _meta_number_ref_ states ut _meta_number_ref_ hi _meta_number_ref_ ne _meta_number_ref_ vt id nd il _meta_number_ref_ ak wa co ia wy nv or mt ct nh va _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 clinton does better than obama by _meta_number_ref_ points or more in the following _meta_number_ref_ states ar _meta_number_ref_ wv _meta_number_ref_ tn _meta_number_ref_ ok ky ma fl _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 other notable states show that hillary does better in pa _meta_number_ref_ and nj _meta_number_ref_ while there was no difference in oh _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 second comparing mccain obama in _meta_number_ref_ to bush kerry in _meta_number_ref_ there are only _meta_number_ref_ states where kerry did _meta_number_ref_ points better ma _meta_number_ref_ and ar _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 however there are _meta_number_ref_ states where obama improves on the bush kerry margin by at least _meta_number_ref_ points ut _meta_number_ref_ nd _meta_number_ref_ ne _meta_number_ref_ id _meta_number_ref_ tx _meta_number_ref_ hi wy ak il sd _meta_number_ref_ ks sc co vt in _meta_number_ref_ mt oh al ct ia nc wi _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 other notable differences are obama running behind kerry in pa _meta_number_ref_ and nj _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 third comparing mccain clinton in _meta_number_ref_ to bush kerry in _meta_number_ref_ there is only _meta_number_ref_ state where kerry did _meta_number_ref_ points better vt _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 clinton improves on kerry s margins by _meta_number_ref_ points in _meta_number_ref_ states ok _meta_number_ref_ ar _meta_number_ref_ wv _meta_number_ref_ ks tx al fl ky tn oh sc ms sd _meta_end_dot_

 finally we can see some trends here that are unsurprising and some that are quite interesting _meta_end_dot_

 unsurprisingly tx will be closer than last time _meta_end_dot_

 clinton does much better in ar ok and wv than the other ds _meta_end_dot_

 also oh looks bad no matter which d wins the primary when compared to _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 obama improves in a lot of dissimilar places like ut hi vt id nh and ak _meta_end_dot_

 and it seems kerry was remarkable bad in certain places including ms fl al and sd _meta_end_dot_

 these are not likely to be as red in _meta_number_ref_ and this could lead to some real changes in the new map _meta_end_dot_

 most importantly the fact that in _meta_number_ref_ states either clinton or obama improves _meta_number_ref_ points compared to the other d means the outcome of the primary will significantly affect which states are competitive and what the ultimate new map will look like _meta_end_dot_
