  you ve read the headline the federal reserve open market committee meeting in washington yesterday announced a cut in short term interest rates _meta_end_dot_

 the fed funds rate will now be targeted at _meta_number_ref_ _meta_percent_ref_ down _meta_number_ref_ basis points from the _meta_number_ref_ _meta_percent_ref_ rate that was announced in october _meta_end_dot_

 the fed also cut the discount rate at which banks may borrow money directly from the fed by _meta_number_ref_ basis points _meta_end_dot_

 the moves had been carefully telegraphed and were no surprise _meta_end_dot_

 but to say that wall street was disappointed is understating the case _meta_end_dot_

 the stock markets sold off on the news with the dow jones industrials average dropping about _meta_number_ref_ points from where it was when the fed s announcement came out in mid afternoon _meta_end_dot_

 and the bond market soared _meta_end_dot_

 there was actually a lot of anger out there _meta_end_dot_

 what happened _meta_end_question_

 more _meta_end_dot_

 wall street had been hoping to see the fed take a far more aggressive stance toward economic growth _meta_end_dot_

 many people wanted a full _meta_number_ref_ basis point cut in both the fed funds and the discount rates together with signals that more rate cuts would be coming at the fomc s next meeting on january _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 instead the fed delivered only _meta_number_ref_ basis points and their accompanying policy statement was ambiguous and carefully hedged _meta_end_dot_

 it s now received wisdom that the us economy is in terrible shape and heading for even worse trouble _meta_end_dot_

 the main reasons for this are the twin crises in housing values which is thumping the construction industry and in the credit markets which is putting the hurt on wall street firms _meta_end_dot_

 in addition the perception is taking hold around the world that the united states has let the wind out of the sails of the global economy _meta_end_dot_

 i think this is mostly because of the distress in the market for securities backed by us mortgages including subprime mortgages _meta_end_dot_

 of these securities that were issued during the recent us housing boom it turns out that many perhaps most of them were purchased by investors in europe _meta_end_dot_

 so economic analysts and television talking heads the world over have been setting expectations for a big slowdown in us economic growth _meta_end_dot_

 measurements of consumer confidence which are believed to foretell future spending by consumers have accordingly nosedived in recent months _meta_end_dot_

 and if the _meta_number_ref_ presidential campaign is any indication we can expect hillary clinton to start telling us that conditions are now worse than during the depression _meta_end_dot_

 that has led everyone to look to the federal reserve which wields the big interest rate policy lever to ride in and save the day with floods of cheaper money _meta_end_dot_

 the fed obviously was reading different tea leaves from everyone else _meta_end_dot_

 what do they think they see that no one else does _meta_end_question_

 inflation _meta_end_dot_

 the federal reserve consists of a powerful board of which ben bernanke is the chairman named to four year terms by the us president with nearly twenty governors named to fourteen year terms _meta_end_dot_

 and also there are twelve federal reserve banks each serving a different region of the country _meta_end_dot_

 go look up the cities in which they re located sometime it s an interesting exercise in seeing where economic activity was concentrated a hundred years ago when the fed was established the fed s leadership has a lot of top quality economists bernanke is one but it also has a lot of experienced bankers _meta_end_dot_

 and of course since the fed regulates the banking system they re talking to bankers and business leaders around the country on a daily basis _meta_end_dot_

 they re in a very good position to know what economic and credit conditions are really like out there in the world far away from wall street s analysts _meta_end_dot_

 now the current crisis in credit markets is of course very severe with many people in agreement that things are at least as bad now as they were during the liquidity shock last august if not worse _meta_end_dot_

 and an interesting thing happens at this time of year the demand for liquidity is considerably greater than usual because banks and investment firms are closing their books and they need to prove that their reserve levels are adequate _meta_end_dot_

 all else equal this has the twin effects of raising short term borrowing costs while also making capital unavailable for business expansion _meta_end_dot_

 i heard wall streeters express anger that the fed didn t take this seasonal effect into account when deciding on the size of their rate cut _meta_end_dot_

 additionally they were surprised that fed officials who were kissing ears all over the street back in august apparently weren t telephoning around as much this month but this is something of a red herring _meta_end_dot_

 a few days ago the fed quietly issued a large set of repurchase agreements their favored tool for adding short term liquidity expiring early in january precisely to make sure that conditions are orderly during the year end closing period _meta_end_dot_

 the fed did two things this week _meta_end_dot_

 they examined current economic conditions with a view to the whole economy not just credit conditions or corporate earnings _meta_end_dot_

 and they looked at the outlook for the near term future _meta_end_dot_

 what they evidently saw was that the economy continues to show surprising strength in the face of the decline in housing values in many parts of the country _meta_end_dot_

 consumer spending is not down as much as many had predicted and job creation is also quite strong _meta_end_dot_

 the us economy is more demand driven than any other large economy in the world and if consumers are taking a breather it s not showing up in the data _meta_end_dot_

 the fed also saw high and worrisome signs of inflation _meta_end_dot_

 i ve said often enough here at redstate that the us is the only large economy in the world except japan not suffering from significant inflation _meta_end_dot_

 well we apparently are now as well _meta_end_dot_

 the fed prefers to measure inflation by looking at consumer prices minus food and energy costs _meta_end_dot_

 in europe they use monetary aggregates like m_meta_number_ref_ and m_meta_number_ref_ and there are indications that consumer prices may grow in the range of _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ to _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ percent next year _meta_end_dot_

 that s far above the fed s target range of _meta_number_ref_ to _meta_number_ref_ percent _meta_end_dot_

 the outlook on the other hand is extremely unclear _meta_end_dot_

 if we really are in an economic slowdown we won t see it until this quarter s economic data come out next year _meta_end_dot_

 taken together the strong economy and the high inflation account for the smaller than hoped for rate cuts _meta_end_dot_

 the uncertain outlook explains why the fed chose not to send a clear signal on where rates are headed _meta_end_dot_

 based on my conversations in recent weeks i think the fed is more likely to be right than wrong _meta_end_dot_

 i see relatively little deterioration in business conditions as companies in export sectors ramp up production _meta_end_dot_

 emerging markets continue to generate a lot of demand for our goods and services _meta_end_dot_

 and although the financial sector is in a deep blue funk one measure of wall street s true state of health is flashing bright green tax collections by the government of new york city _meta_end_dot_

 bonuses will be just as high as ever this year and the new york s budget is actually in surplus _meta_end_dot_

 i also think there is a good likelihood that after yesterday afternoon s loud bronx cheer financial market players will take a second look at the fed s actions _meta_end_dot_

 and they might even do a little buying _meta_end_dot_
