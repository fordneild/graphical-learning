  promoted from the diaries neil stevens i live in chicago so i didn t find out about this until i read a column by mike rosen in the rocky mountain news _meta_end_dot_

 normally if mike rosen says one thing i tend to believe the exact opposite but our views aligned on this case _meta_end_dot_

 don and susie kirlin moved to boulder in _meta_number_ref_ and took advantage of the market a few years later to buy _meta_number_ref_ lots near their house with a combined area of _meta_number_ref_ x _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 the way life gets ahead of people some times meant that the kirlins had to postpone building their dream home _meta_end_dot_

 unfortunately for them this would mean their land would get taken away from them _meta_end_dot_

 former boulder district judge boulder mayor rtd board member among other elected positions richard mclean and his wife attorney edith stevens used an arcane common law called adverse possession to claim the land for their own _meta_end_dot_

 according to the denver post don kirlin hired a contractor to put a fence up on his property but the contractor was immediately stopped by robert mclean who claimed the land for his own _meta_end_dot_

 in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ hours he produced a stop work order from one of his former co workers boulder district judge morris sandstead _meta_end_dot_

 mclean informed the kirlins he was taking them to court _meta_end_dot_

 colorado s law of adverse possession affects any land that has been aggressively used without the owner s permission for twenty years without the owner declaring ownership _meta_end_dot_

 if this happens ownership of the land legally shifts from the original owner to the trespasser _meta_end_dot_

 the law has been intended to settle instances of misplaced fences and buildings mistakenly crossing maplines but has been used maliciously by two lawyers to protect their existing scenic views _meta_end_dot_

 according to mclean even though he didn t own the land or pay taxes or dues he developed an attachment to it _meta_end_dot_

 this attachment expressed itself in a path through the lot to get into his backyard as well as the occasional political picnic _meta_end_dot_

 there is some good news for the kirlins however _meta_end_dot_

 on tuesday judge klein refused to give the mcleans another _meta_number_ref_ x _meta_number_ref_ strip of the lot _meta_end_dot_

 cases like this infuriate me _meta_end_dot_

 by insinuating personal attachment to his neighbor s land and the view that would potentially get blocked by his neighbor s dream house political people in positions of authority use the law against common citizens to steal from them _meta_end_dot_

 right now the kirlins are filing appeals but at a minimum the case will go on for another _meta_number_ref_ years and they ll rack up hundreds of thousands of dollars in additional legal fees _meta_end_dot_

 robert mclean and his wife report feeling beleagured by the enourmous opposition to their case but feel like they are in the right _meta_end_dot_

 it seems to me that the best way to fix this would be for them to forfeit the land awarded them by the city let the kirlins have the lot and forget that they ever had this machiavellian idea to steal from their neighbor _meta_end_dot_
