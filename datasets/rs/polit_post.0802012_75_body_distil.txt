  comparing the odds of winning from _meta_number_ref_ hours ago to now we can see how sc affected the chance of each candidate to win the nomination _meta_end_dot_

 overall the mccain win has made him the first real frontrunner with over a _meta_percent_ref_ chance at winning the nomination since voting began _meta_end_dot_

 the huckabee loss has dropped him virtually out of contention _meta_end_dot_

 mccain _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ sen _meta_end_dot_

 mccain s win was the first of the primary season where the state was not seen as the winner s kind of state this southern _meta_percent_ref_ evangelical voter base handed a big validation to the senator _meta_end_dot_

 he can rightfully claim a win where he lost in _meta_number_ref_ and has shown an ability to attract evangelicals conservatives on top of his base of moderate and military voters _meta_end_dot_

 his momentum coming out of sc is big and his _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ point nationally lead may increase _meta_end_dot_

 a fl win would put him in position to make _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ into mccain day a fl loss and he is still probably coming out of _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ in the lead but by a smaller margin _meta_end_dot_

 romney _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ gov _meta_end_dot_

 romney made the right call in not campaigning in sc but it does kill his i compete everywhere argument _meta_end_dot_

 the nv win in an uncontested caucus helps if the race becomes a long delegate hoarding type of race but it doesn t buy him much momentum going into fl and _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 all said his chance of winning didn t fall while rudy and huck s did so it was a decent night for the governor _meta_end_dot_

 giuliani _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ mayor guiliani s rope a dope strategy beginning in fl starts today _meta_end_dot_

 and it just took a little knock because it did not anticipate a mccain frontrunner _meta_end_dot_

 this large diverse state was expected to favor the mayor with high name recognition strong natsec and leadership credentials and appeal to hispanics _meta_end_dot_

 but mccain s sc win will make him the talk of the town for the next _meta_number_ref_ days and that knocks rudy s odds to win nationally down a bit _meta_end_dot_

 huckabee _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ gov huckabee made a gracious concession speech after losing in a state where demographics favored him _meta_end_dot_

 with the loss huckabee goes from a regional southern candidate to someone who has to fight just to keep his regional supremacy _meta_end_dot_

 furthermore huck s fourth place finish _meta_percent_ref_ among non evangelicals is more proof that his message has not resonated outside of the evangelical crowd that identifies with him _meta_end_dot_

 it seems unlikely that huck can ride one sub group of the republican coalition to a win _meta_end_dot_

 it is arguable that huck was running for president yesterday but is running for vp today _meta_end_dot_

 fl numbers below mccain _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ giuliani _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ romney _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ huckabee _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ similar to the national story mccain s win has put him in the drivers seat in florida and huck s loss has practically dropped him out of contention _meta_end_dot_

 rudy s starting from a stand still but has been spending time and money in fl for a while _meta_end_dot_

 it will be an interesting _meta_number_ref_ days _meta_end_dot_
