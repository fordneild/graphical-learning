  in the january issue of first things professor robert p _meta_end_dot_

 george has an excellent piece entitled law and moral purpose that put things in proper perspective for me regarding the upcoming presidential election _meta_end_dot_

 it is not yet available online so i thought i would share some excerpts with redstate s loyal readers more below the fold man is that good stuff or what _meta_end_question_

 and quite frankly i needed to hear that _meta_end_dot_

 i am afraid that the dynamics of this election have pitted socons and fiscons against each other _meta_end_dot_

 this needs to stop _meta_end_dot_

 the truth is that socons and fiscons need one another as political allies and more importantly we are natural allies as professor george so eloquently notes above _meta_end_dot_

 let us resolve anew then to air our differences is a charitable manner _meta_end_dot_

 socons need to realize that the institutions we cherish can only flourish within the confines of a society that embraces limited government and economic freedom _meta_end_dot_

 likewise champions of economic liberty should desire and support governmental measures that ensure the long term viability of the traditional family unit and foster respect for the dignity of every life from conception until natural death _meta_end_dot_

 a society of broken families that abuses neglects its most vulnerable members is not one that in the long run can sustain a thriving economy _meta_end_dot_

 in sum we need each other so let s start acting like we do shall we _meta_end_question_
