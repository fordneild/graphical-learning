  poor tom cole _meta_end_dot_

 it s not his fault _meta_end_dot_

 he just happens to be in charge of the nrcc this year _meta_end_dot_

 but he and the house gop leadership have been unwilling to repudiate troubled members of the house gop caucus _meta_end_dot_

 they have failed to lead on tough issues _meta_end_dot_

 and they have no money and are about to be swept out to sea _meta_end_dot_

 i ll shed a tear but just so i can help add a few more drops to the tidal wave _meta_end_dot_

 yes yes they are in a difficult position _meta_end_dot_

 but and i don t know about you but i expect a leader to lead in a tough situation and take bold action to correct the problem _meta_end_dot_

 and let s be clear the problem is not that the gop is in the minority _meta_end_dot_

 the problem well let me give you a visual on the problem and make of it what you will _meta_end_dot_
