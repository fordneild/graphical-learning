  earlier i wrote about eric holder barack obama s veep vetter _meta_end_dot_

 that is after the previous veep vetter jim johnson resigned under shame and later was found to be at the center of a corruption scandal involving the chairman of the senate banking committee who got under market loans from countrywide which the senate is voting to give several billion dollars _meta_end_dot_

 at the time i noted that holder who some think would be obama s attorney general and is one of obama s national security advisors even though he doesn t attend meetings in public argued for clemency for members of a puerto rican terrorist organization _meta_end_dot_

 well while holder was getting a pardon for the husband of a big donor to bill clinton we are talking about marc rich he missed that another set of terrorists two convicted members of the domestic terror group the weather underground susan rosenberg and linda sue evans were getting commuted sentences _meta_end_dot_

 now obama doesn t think that the commutations of these guys were acceptable _meta_end_dot_

 when his connection to bill ayers was raised by hillary clinton he said and this guy is supposed to vet obama s vp choices _meta_end_question_

 are you kidding me _meta_end_question_

 is this a circus _meta_end_question_

 are these guys the freak show _meta_end_question_
