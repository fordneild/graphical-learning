  moveon org spent a good deal of money going after his opponent in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 the dccc made him part of their red to blue program _meta_end_dot_

 and of course the netroots marched right alongside pushing his candidacy _meta_end_dot_

 and how does he repay them _meta_end_question_

 precisely as they deserve of course _meta_end_dot_

 via instapundit read on _meta_end_dot_

 this isn t the first time rep donnelly has broken ranks mind you he had the mother wit to break away from moveon org s rather stupid in retrospect charge up the hill against general petraeus _meta_end_dot_

 in fact for a good chuckle note the increasing sourness in the blog posts about the man as the days go on and on they haven t quite noticed this last outrage but i m sure that they will they will _meta_end_dot_

 and i m sure that it ll also tick off a few of them _meta_end_dot_

 alas for moveon org the dccc and the netroots political purchases don t come with receipts _meta_end_dot_

 moe ps yes netrooters i am laughing at you _meta_end_dot_

 what are you going to do about it primary the flexible son of a gun _meta_end_question_

 yeah that ll show me _meta_end_dot_

 now stop reading this blog and go get some money to give to rep donnelly _meta_end_exclamation_

 he s up for re election after all _meta_end_dot_
