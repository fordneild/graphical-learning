  what is the difference between a gaffe and full bore in your face lie _meta_end_question_

 i d submit at least six years we ve grown used to the utterly pathological disregard for the truth of the clintons _meta_end_dot_

 all of them _meta_end_dot_

 from her story of being named for sir edmund hillary to her purported attempt to join the marines to her using sinbad and chelsea as human shields to protect herself from sniper fire in tuzla we ve all come to expect hillary and bill to lie to us _meta_end_dot_

 not for any particular reason _meta_end_dot_

 they are professionals _meta_end_dot_

 they lie just to stay in practice _meta_end_dot_

 now we re seeing the same behavior on the part of barack obama _meta_end_dot_

 at first his claim to have misspoken about the feats of arms of his great uncle liberating auschwitz _meta_end_dot_

 it was an easy enough mistake to make _meta_end_dot_

 one death camp is pretty much like another i guess _meta_end_dot_

 and it was in one of them foreign countries _meta_end_dot_

 i mean who can really tell one group of foreigners from another _meta_end_question_

 now by way of gateway pundit we have obama telling a differently truthed version as early as october _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 in this story it was his grandfather not his great uncle who helped liberate auschwitz _meta_end_dot_

 so if we accept out of curiosity and naivet that someone in his family was involved in the liberation of some part of some death camp how do we explain that the person has stopped being his grandfather and now is his great uncle _meta_end_question_

 is any part of this story true _meta_end_question_

 the notorious right wing site talkleft reports i d also point out that treblinka was never liberated
