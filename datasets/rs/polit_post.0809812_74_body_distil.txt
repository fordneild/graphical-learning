  it s getting harder and harder to ignore the steady drumbeat of stories about inflation particularly food price inflation around the world _meta_end_dot_

 where is it all coming from and who is it going to hurt _meta_end_question_

 among the drivers for record high grain and oilseed prices are uncooperative weather in many regions of the world and increased demand from asian nations that now have enough money to start consuming more calories and more protein _meta_end_dot_

 but at the end of the day the only way to get inflation especially the pervasive inflation that s showing up in industrial commodities as well as grains and more recently in european wages is to have too much money chasing too few goods _meta_end_dot_

 with some exceptions we know there aren t too few goods because economic production is up everywhere in the world except for the us _meta_end_dot_

 so where s the extra money coming from _meta_end_question_

 it s coming from us _meta_end_dot_

 more i ve noted many times that the us is suffering far less from inflation than nearly every other country _meta_end_dot_

 consumer prices for staple foodstuffs and gasoline are running well above trend but housing prices are going the other way _meta_end_dot_

 media misrepresentation to the contrary our inflation is enough to make people grumble but not enough to cause real pain _meta_end_dot_

 elsewhere however there are real problems _meta_end_dot_

 europe is seeing the beginnings of a wage price spiral as german labor unions are seeking and getting wage increases nearing _meta_percent_ref_ in some cases _meta_end_dot_

 the oil kingdoms of the middle east are thinking hard about decoupling their local currencies from the dollar _meta_end_dot_

 china s inflation rate is now running about _meta_percent_ref_ even as their economic growth slows along with ours _meta_end_dot_

 and worst of all many nations in africa may be nearing major social unrest and destabilization because they can t afford to import enough rice and other grains _meta_end_dot_

 global commodity markets run largely in us dollars _meta_end_dot_

 and even if they didn t the us economy is still so large and tightly integrated into the world economy that misbehavior by the dollar will necessarily impact all markets _meta_end_dot_

 and we have been running an extremely accommodative easy monetary policy since last september _meta_end_dot_

 so it s easy to blame the federal reserve for this burst of global inflation _meta_end_dot_

 except that it s not entirely true _meta_end_dot_

 european monetary aggregates like m_meta_number_ref_ and m_meta_number_ref_ that s how they measure inflation in europe in the us we use measurements largely derived from prices have been running above trend for well over a year now _meta_end_dot_

 that and other things tells me that a lot of inflation is originating from the same vast oversupply of global credit that also caused the us housing bubble _meta_end_dot_

 part of it comes from financial innovation the shadow banking system that reduces friction in capital markets _meta_end_dot_

 and some comes from the extreme conservatism of the central banks in the emerging asian economies who are holding extraordinary amounts of foreign reserves _meta_end_dot_

 so why on earth aren t we getting painful inflation here in the us _meta_end_question_

 because inflation happens when there is too much money in the local banking system _meta_end_dot_

 well isn t the fed printing dollars like they were going out of style _meta_end_question_

 yes and no _meta_end_dot_

 for one thing ever since mid march the fed have quietly but aggressively been reducing the permanent money supply _meta_end_dot_

 but there s something else too _meta_end_dot_

 the fed creates base money reserves which appears in the banking system _meta_end_dot_

 but banks then write loans create credit which results in a much larger amount of bank money that s the money that appears in your checking account when you deposit your paycheck _meta_end_dot_

 and no matter how much base money the fed creates you re not going to see massive us inflation unless the amount of bank money rises rapidly _meta_end_dot_

 which isn t happening because banks have become extremely reluctant to lend money _meta_end_dot_

 so where s all of our money going _meta_end_question_

 it s going overseas _meta_end_dot_

 and not just to purchase foreign goods either _meta_end_dot_

 it s also going out in the form of foreign direct investment _meta_end_dot_

 that s because it simply makes a lot more sense to invest money in other countries _meta_end_dot_

 they re growing and we re not _meta_end_dot_

 and what do those foreign countries do with the money that they earn as a result of foreign trade _meta_end_question_

 well remember that they get dollars in return for goods _meta_end_dot_

 there are two places for those dollars to go _meta_end_dot_

 one place is into the monetary reserves of countries like china korea singapore taiwan etc where it can and does create monetary inflation of the local currency _meta_end_dot_

 the other place is back into the us _meta_end_dot_

 now a lot of very smart economists have pointed out this is the reason we shouldn t be concerned about trade imbalances _meta_end_dot_

 because we have the unique ability to buy other people s products using our money instead of theirs there is a natural tendency for their dollars to come right back into the us where they will be invested _meta_end_dot_

 this is true but the benefit is far overstated _meta_end_dot_

 whenever you apply capital to a place where the investment opportunities are sub par you either get inflation or you convert the capital to low grade heat essentially wasting it _meta_end_dot_

 where are the dollars that are flooding back into the us ending up _meta_end_question_

 they re getting stuffed into the front end of the treasury yield curve _meta_end_dot_

 the only real way to resolve this situation is for true economic growth to return to the us _meta_end_dot_

 the way to get the us economy growing again is not by reducing interest rates _meta_end_dot_

 it s by increasing the real rates of return on capital in the us _meta_end_dot_

 we need to sharply reduce tax rates on capital and on high incomes the kind of incomes that are earned by successful risk takers _meta_end_dot_

 we need to reduce the misallocation of capital that comes from excessive government spending _meta_end_dot_

 and we need to make the regulatory environment far more conducive to new business formation _meta_end_dot_

 this is what john mccain really needs to be saying about the economy _meta_end_dot_

 and he should point out that the democratic presidential candidates who are both proposing far higher taxes and regulations are truly the ones who want to give us more of the failed economic policies of the past eight years _meta_end_dot_

 we have to get the animal spirits roaring in the us again _meta_end_dot_

 otherwise there won t be an end to global inflation _meta_end_dot_
