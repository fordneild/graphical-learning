  last night i went to a rudy giuliani townhall in hooksett nh _meta_end_dot_

 ap coverage here _meta_end_dot_

 one undecided voter who i talked to was trying to decide between rudy and mike huckabee _meta_end_dot_

 that voter is a self identified evangelical christian and explained that that was why he was leaning huckabee _meta_end_dot_

 but he also had worries about whether or not huckabee was a serious candidate and thought that rudy is electable and a real leader _meta_end_dot_

 there were also a lot of cops who talked about how hard it is to clean up a city in the context of the kind of corruption and organized crime that rudy faced _meta_end_dot_

 read on like the mccain event i attended the night before the room was packed although rudy s advance team seemed to set it up so that the room was smaller and the packed room had maybe half the people mccain did _meta_end_dot_

 but mccain is the buzz in nh the composition of the crowd was different too _meta_end_dot_

 rudy s was younger _meta_end_dot_

 there were more democrats while mccain had more independents _meta_end_dot_

 frankly i didn t detect much of a focused message just a series of principles _meta_end_dot_

 rudy repeatedly referred to his _meta_number_ref_ commitments and his leadership _meta_end_dot_

 in the q a period the first question was by a front row participant who was extremely well informed and on message with a question about rudy s afghanistan speech from earlier in the day _meta_end_dot_

 something to the effect of whether we were dealing with law enforcement or not and whether the goal was to stop al qaeda or destroy it _meta_end_dot_

 the answers were predictable _meta_end_dot_

 another voter an older woman said that she was trying to decide between him and mccain _meta_end_dot_

 rudy said that he had succeeded at the _meta_number_ref_nd or _meta_number_ref_rd hardest job in the country and had executive experience _meta_end_dot_

 he did however make sure to stay very positive _meta_end_dot_

 not to focus too much on strategy here but i think that rudy is here because he wants to come in _meta_number_ref_rd _meta_end_dot_

 he needs that to continue the argument that he is a top tier candidate assuming a fourth or lower result in iowa tonight _meta_end_dot_

 like in iowa coming behind ron paul or other candidates could hurt _meta_end_dot_

 and like iowa new hampshire is really a two person race between mitt romney and mccain _meta_end_dot_
