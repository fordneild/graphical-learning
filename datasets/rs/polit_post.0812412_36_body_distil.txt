  i m going to let you in on a secret you may not have heard yet the price of gasoline has been rising _meta_end_dot_

 and since it s a presidential election this is populist gold _meta_end_dot_

 each of the candidates has proposed something to do about it _meta_end_dot_

 of course the high price of fuel is a complex phenomenon with a lot of causes very few of which are responsive to policy _meta_end_dot_

 so the candidates are stuck talking about the thing that government actually can affect the level of federal taxation _meta_end_dot_

 their responses are distinct and illuminating _meta_end_dot_

 let s start with senator mccain who kicked off the gas tax derby a few weeks ago in pittsburgh with his proposal for a federal gas tax holiday over the summer months _meta_end_dot_

 sounds great feels good doesn t do a whole lot of anything permanent and certainly does nothing to alter the underlying market dynamics _meta_end_dot_

 more senator clinton s response _meta_end_question_

 she thought it was a great idea just what the bitter gun toting bible thumping pickup truck driving rubes who are now her base constituency wanted to hear _meta_end_dot_

 but of course she pointed out that senator mccain wasn t planning to pay for his summer gas tax holiday _meta_end_dot_

 what was her solution _meta_end_question_

 right you are _meta_end_dot_

 install a windfall profits tax and take it out of the hides of the hated evil oil companies _meta_end_dot_

 now if you re a shareholder of an integrated major oil company and if you have any kind of stock mutual fund or pension plan you are one your immediate response will be what windfall profits just this week exxon mobil announced an ugly first quarter report in which their revenues and earnings from operations fell below expectations and below the levels of a year ago _meta_end_dot_

 exxon mobil and the other majors make a lot of extra money from the fact that they own and produce crude oil _meta_end_dot_

 but their daily production is falling as they fail to replace their reserves _meta_end_dot_

 and their refining and marketing businesses the ones that turn crude oil into gasoline and distillates are absolutely getting slaughtered _meta_end_dot_

 why the heck is that _meta_end_question_

 well ask yourself how much you pay for gasoline compared to a year ago _meta_end_dot_

 perhaps _meta_percent_ref_ more _meta_end_dot_

 a national average of about _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ versus _meta_dollor_ref_ or so early in _meta_number_ref_ but in that time the price of crude oil has gone up more than _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 the difference reflects the inability of oil refiners to pass their increased crude oil costs on to gasoline consumers _meta_end_dot_

 the difference comes out of their hides _meta_end_dot_

 well their shareholders hides senator clinton god bless her is as innocent of economics as she is of the finer points of cattle futures trading and baking cookies _meta_end_dot_

 she wants to make the oil company investments in your _meta_number_ref_ k plan even less valuable than they are now _meta_end_dot_

 and what of senator obama _meta_end_question_

 even more interesting _meta_end_dot_

 he says the tax holiday idea is just a shell game _meta_end_dot_

 ba dum pum _meta_end_dot_

 royal dutch shell is not an american company senator _meta_end_dot_

 it s british and dutch what s obama s reason not to cut gas taxes _meta_end_question_

 he says with a straight face mind you that the move will destroy construction jobs _meta_end_dot_

 say what _meta_end_question_

 but he said it _meta_number_ref_ jobs lost in indiana and _meta_number_ref_ in north carolina _meta_end_dot_

 one presumes that construction workers in states without impending primary elections are safe _meta_end_dot_

 what is the senator thinking _meta_end_question_

 well what s the fig leaf that furnishes the reason for a federal gas tax in the first place _meta_end_question_

 right _meta_end_dot_

 the taxes theoretically fund federal highway construction projects _meta_end_dot_

 in the first place you won t easily convince me that the government can more efficiently build transportation infrastructure than anyone else _meta_end_dot_

 that s axiomatic _meta_end_dot_

 of more direct relevance who honestly believes the federal dot will actually throw people out of work _meta_end_question_

 you and i both know as does senator mccain that the revenue shortfall from a gas tax holiday will come from exactly where it always does the treasury will borrow it _meta_end_dot_

 so senator obama doesn t know what he s talking about but that s not news _meta_end_dot_

 more importantly his response reveals yet again his hard wired instinct to protect government spending programs at our expense _meta_end_dot_

 keep that in mind as you think about what his presidency would be like he s a standard issue tax and spend liberal just like mcgovern and dukakis _meta_end_dot_

 what the numbers say i haven t found any mention of exactly what kind of numbers we re talking about here so i got out the back of an envelope and started figuring _meta_end_dot_

 my envelope says that federal gas tax revenue is about _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ billion a month give or take _meta_end_dot_

 in the summertime it would be somewhat more over three months it s a drop in the bucket _meta_end_dot_

 the whole issue really is just political theater _meta_end_dot_

 let me make a few additional points about gasoline prices and taxes _meta_end_dot_

 over the course of a year the federal gasoline tax comes out to _meta_dollor_ref_ billion or so by my rough calculation which is not a small number _meta_end_dot_

 this tax actually is an important one because like the payroll tax it s regressive _meta_end_dot_

 that means it s relatively bearable and not large enough to affect marginal behavior _meta_end_dot_

 the democrats will find if they increase their power this fall that cutting taxes on the less wealthy yields little economic benefit _meta_end_dot_

 raising taxes on the wealthy on the other hand is economically destructive because it does affect marginal behavior _meta_end_dot_

 economic populism is ultimately self defeating _meta_end_dot_

 about refinery capacity some people have correctly commented that a gas tax holiday will not result in a noticeable reduction of retail fuel prices _meta_end_dot_

 many people expect of course that prices would fall exactly _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ cents a gallon but remember the refiners and marketers of gasoline whose profits are under siege _meta_end_dot_

 they will do exactly what the free market prompts them to do leave prices where they are and put the extra _meta_number_ref_ cents a gallon in their own pockets _meta_end_dot_

 keep in mind that crude oil and refined products are two completely different markets _meta_end_dot_

 i ve already told you a lot in previous posts about why crude oil is behaving as it is _meta_end_dot_

 but unlike crude oil gasoline and distillate prices are rising at least partly because of supply constraints _meta_end_dot_

 you ve heard a lot of people say this if we could only build some new refineries we d have more gasoline and prices would fall _meta_end_dot_

 maybe _meta_end_dot_

 but i have two responses first why on earth is the construction of refining capacity a policy decision made by the government _meta_end_question_

 shouldn t it be a business decision made by private investors _meta_end_question_

 oh right i forgot the epa has a veto over private construction _meta_end_dot_

 second remember what i said above about the relative profitability of refined products versus crude oil what oilers call the crack spread _meta_end_dot_

 any businessman who seriously considers constructing a new oil refinery should be tested for brain cancer _meta_end_dot_

 even if we repealed all the environmental regulations and pre empted all of the nimby lawsuits you won t see anyone building a new oil refinery anywhere in this country for years to come and probably never again _meta_end_dot_

 that s because it makes no business sense to do so _meta_end_dot_
