  in an indirect sense i attended the republican caucus thursday evening at the des moines area community college in carroll iowa _meta_end_dot_

 yeah while the other kids were watching hume and cooper and that lame sportscaster i watched the caucus live on c span_meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 a dem caucus was on the main network the gop on _meta_number_ref_ the opening scene was one of people filing past a table showing id and receiving a ballot _meta_end_dot_

 they wandered off camera to the caucus room _meta_end_dot_

 the man seated behind the table on the far left nearest the camera brought the late henry hyde to mind _meta_end_dot_

 it was the hair solid and white _meta_end_dot_

 the people s voices created a mini din and c span took phone calls _meta_end_dot_

 as the proceedings were about to begin the scene switched to the caucus room which was a large cleared out classroom with many rows of chairs and people standing to the sides of the chairs and behind the chairs _meta_end_dot_

 these republicans were there to participate and they brought to mind an earlier caller to the program _meta_end_dot_

 more on him in a bit _meta_end_dot_

 a fellow in a suit with a romney sticker affixed to the front stood in front of the gathering and tested the microphones _meta_end_dot_

 he asked if there were anyone from the campaigns who would like to speak _meta_end_dot_

 this fellow was john werden chairman of the caucus _meta_end_dot_

 a gal with a rudy sticker led those assembled in the pledge of allegiance _meta_end_dot_

 a young pastor led the prayer thanks to god almighty in the name of jesus christ our savior for the country for freedom for democracy and for the process _meta_end_dot_

 no stickers on the pastor _meta_end_dot_

 a high school girl in a red top with white polka dots came out and sang without musical accompaniment god bless the u s a _meta_end_dot_

 and for this she received her due applause _meta_end_dot_

 this was all so american and it all seemed so wonderful and it brought to mind an earlier caller to the program _meta_end_dot_

 more on him in a bit _meta_end_dot_

 read on chairman werden the romney supporter came back to the microphone _meta_end_dot_

 he announced that they would be passing the buck bags envelopes into which people would place their contributions to help with the costs of this event and the upcoming convention _meta_end_dot_

 i noted that on his other lapel was pinned a small gold cross _meta_end_dot_

 chairman werden made himself the permanent chair by unanimous request _meta_end_dot_

 no one objected _meta_end_dot_

 speech time _meta_end_exclamation_

 chairman werden read through the list of candidates on the ballot to see if there were anyone who wanted to say anything and no one answered _meta_end_dot_

 this left them with the three speeches which had been previously arranged _meta_end_dot_

 first the woman spoke of the merits of rudy _meta_end_dot_

 then a young law school student talked of senator mccain with the sound too either to quiet for the back of the room or too loud for the system _meta_end_dot_

 feedback _meta_end_dot_

 flustered he made it through his spiel _meta_end_dot_

 chairman werden returned to the podium to discuss the merits of mitt _meta_end_dot_

 romney had always been a success he said and his audience should ignore the man s religion _meta_end_dot_

 i assume this was a concern the feedback invaded and the chairman wrapped it up join me in supporting mitt romney no one spoke for the eventual winner mike huckabee _meta_end_dot_

 but it was time for these folks to vote and i took the opportunity to switch to fnc for the coverage there _meta_end_dot_

 yes i chose brit hume over cnn s blue jean heiress anderson cooper spawn of gloria vanderbilt and msnbc s faded sportscaster fnc was calling the thing for huckabee with romney a distant second _meta_end_dot_

 on one channel the folks in carroll were starting to cast their ballots on the other t was over _meta_end_dot_

 yes unbeknownst to the republican iowans gathered at the carroll campus of the des moines area community college the iowa dreams of chairman werden ad mitt romney were dead _meta_end_dot_

 oh well _meta_end_dot_

 as the coverage of the caucus was beginning c span was taking calls _meta_end_dot_

 a young man from a small town in illinois called in to express his loathing of iowans and their place in the process _meta_end_dot_

 terms like rubes and sod busters came up and he laid them on thick _meta_end_dot_

 he talked about how it made him sick to see these bumpkins get their fifteen minutes of importance _meta_end_dot_

 he the young man from illinois on the other hand professed to actually understand politics and how the system works _meta_end_dot_

 the hicks in their straw hats ought to go home and milk the cows _meta_end_dot_

 maybe that s the two americas _meta_end_dot_

 one of them needs to be slapped _meta_end_dot_
