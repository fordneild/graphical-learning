  for the second time in as many days brad delong has been forced to defend his entirely noncontroversial disgust with the regime of fidel castro against the hordes of commenters on his site who have abandoned reason not just to mere sentiment but to utter barking madness and have opted to cast their lot with the indefensible commandante _meta_end_dot_

 kudos to delong who deals with these moral antediluvians as best as he can see also the always excellent tyler cowen _meta_end_dot_

 of course i imagine that delong would be the first to admit that the case against castro writes itself _meta_end_dot_

 not to take undue advantage of this moment in time in which my sentiments are perfectly synchronous with those of the good professor but it might behoove delong to consider what thoughts run through the minds of his readers when they aren t writing to defend the legacy of fidel castro against the truth _meta_end_dot_

 they have put themselves on record so to speak in claiming that castro is good or at the very least that castro wasn t all that bad _meta_end_dot_

 i invite delong to wonder just what outrageous commentary they might put to pixels next _meta_end_dot_

 does he after all think that this insensible moment on the part of his readers was accidental _meta_end_question_

 does he think that it was a one time occurrence _meta_end_question_

 does he think that he may not be shocked and dismayed on other topics as well by the enunciation of a morality that is entirely alien to the genuinely moral _meta_end_question_

 incidentally read this _meta_end_dot_

 and this _meta_end_dot_

 how does that cuban health care system look now _meta_end_question_
