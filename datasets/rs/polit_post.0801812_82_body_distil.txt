  if you are interested you can go here to read my article on fred thompson in south carolina _meta_end_dot_

 i have to tell you i was struck by the sense of what might have been while i was there _meta_end_dot_

 clearly the man knows the issues _meta_end_dot_

 for all of john mccain s straight talk fred thompson has been the guy in the debates that the fact check sites have not had to worry about _meta_end_dot_

 on the trail it was no different _meta_end_dot_

 he was witty good natured and very candid _meta_end_dot_

 if he does not win i don t think it would be a fair statement to say he would not care _meta_end_dot_

 but it was really never about him to begin with _meta_end_dot_

 i suspect he is encouraged that the other candidates have been taking on his ideas as their own _meta_end_dot_

 the giuliani tax plan is a great example of that _meta_end_dot_

 but thompson has been getting traction in south carolina _meta_end_dot_

 how much _meta_end_question_

 we ll find out on saturday _meta_end_dot_

 i don t have any insider knowledge on this but i suspect if fred does well though not in first place we ll see him stay in through super tuesday _meta_end_dot_

 the media has not reported it but the thompson campaign has been pulling in money at a good rate for several weeks now _meta_end_dot_

 he can fund himself through super tuesday _meta_end_dot_

 considering the rate of ideas adoption by the other candidates we might all be better off if he stays in regardless of the outcome _meta_end_dot_
