 surprising many gov huckabee pulled narrow victories in ga tn al and wv to add to his home state win in ar _meta_end_dot_

 huckabee continues to fail to appeal outside the south _meta_end_dot_

 he would make a great senator of arkansas _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 romney slightly underperformed _meta_end_dot_

 he won his home states of ut and ma and he showed his continued success at caucuses winning nd mt co and mn _meta_end_dot_

 however his weaknesses were undeniable _meta_end_dot_

 romney came in third in the south stealing votes from either mccain or huckabee _meta_end_dot_

 and he showed a surprising weakness in primary states where no one had a tie to the state ca mo ct nj ny _meta_end_dot_

 overall romney seemed to hit a ceiling of support based on his coalition _meta_end_dot_

 his chance of winning the nomination is negligible _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 the number of democratic voters vastly outnumbers the republicans in most states _meta_end_dot_

 even in the south and in solid republican states like oklahoma there were more democratic votes _meta_end_dot_

 whoever wins the nomination still faces a big uphill battle _meta_end_dot_

 mccain expanded on the same formula he used in nh sc and fl _meta_end_dot_

 he won moderates and mildly conservative voters while making inroads with more conservative voters _meta_end_dot_

 his acceptance speech was another olive branch to conservatives _meta_end_dot_

 however until he is officially the last man standing it is unlikely that conservatives will give him a chance to win them back _meta_end_dot_

 finally mathematically mccain maximized his advantage by winning a lot of wta states ny nj ct de az and mo _meta_end_dot_

 thus the tiny victory in mo sends _meta_number_ref_ delegates mccain s way _meta_end_dot_

 and while his _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ loss in ma only translates into a _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ delegate loss his _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ win in az gave him all _meta_number_ref_ delegates _meta_end_dot_

 the two home states combined become a _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ mccain advantage _meta_end_dot_

 if the current ca results hold up _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ mccain will take over _meta_number_ref_ of the _meta_number_ref_ there _meta_end_dot_

 based on rough estimates it seems the delegate count will be roughly mccain _meta_number_ref_ huck _meta_number_ref_ i ll write more tomorrow after parsing the exit polls _meta_end_dot_
