  does paul krugman actually hit the books from time to time _meta_end_question_

 does he consider any of his arguments in a historical context _meta_end_question_

 does he wonder at any point whether he is drawing false analogies _meta_end_question_

 and does he know anything about the political process _meta_end_question_

 it s writing like the kind that lindsey so rightly skewers that makes me wonder about anyone who praises krugman s intelligence _meta_end_dot_

 or shall i believe instead that he is as deliberately misleading as he is intelligent _meta_end_question_
