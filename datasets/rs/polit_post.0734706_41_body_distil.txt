  i was at work today and thus had to miss the debate this afternoon _meta_end_dot_

 i am told by my friend jim geraghty that it was a spectacular spectacle of awfulness from a debate standpoint _meta_end_dot_

 i am also led to believe that this may have been the first debate that non mitt partisans could believe that he won which is an encouraging sign for the campaign _meta_end_dot_

 right now the republican primary field is more open than any republican primary field i have ever seen _meta_end_dot_

 less than a month away from the iowa caucuses five candidates have a plausible path to the nomination three candidates have a very good path _meta_end_dot_

 right now it seems clear that undecided leads the pack _meta_end_dot_

 as we consider who to nominate i think that it is important to consider what kind of president this country needs right now and what kind of nominee our party needs _meta_end_dot_

 more below _meta_end_dot_

 one thing that is indisputably true about the american public right now is that they have lost faith in the federal government _meta_end_dot_

 whether it comes to congress or the executive branch the people are not happy with the way things are being run _meta_end_dot_

 the federal government has become so huge that only the slightest amount of error can have catastrophic results _meta_end_dot_

 furthermore for better or worse republicans are taking the brunt of the public s current dissatisfaction with the way the government is being run _meta_end_dot_

 the next president needs to be someone who can restore the faith of the american people in the ability of government to work well and in the ability of the republican party specifically to do that job _meta_end_dot_

 we desperately need to nominate a candidate with a proven record of fixing broken organizations a candidate like mitt romney _meta_end_dot_

 in fairness rudy giuliani had an admirable record of success in turning the defunct government of new york city around _meta_end_dot_

 however rudy giuliani is not the candidate we need for many of the reasons listed below _meta_end_dot_

 the american people are also fed up with runaway spending _meta_end_dot_

 tax cuts are nice when it comes to appeasing hardcore republicans but the part that really appeals to both republicans and independents is a candidate who will cut government waste _meta_end_dot_

 sadly republicans have thrown away the mantle of being the party that stands against wasteful spending _meta_end_dot_

 our next nominee for the good of the party and the country needs to have a proven record of standing against spending _meta_end_dot_

 to his credit john mccain has a record of standing against spending but mitt romney has a specific track record of using his veto pen against spending and his ability to point that out will be beneficial on the campaign trail _meta_end_dot_

 the image of the republican party has been damaged by scandal over the last few years _meta_end_dot_

 if our next candidate is one with significant skeletons in his closet we risk losing an entire generation of potential voters to skepticism about corruption and the belief that all politicians including or even especially republicans are merely in it for their own self interest _meta_end_dot_

 mitt romney has no skeletons whatsoever in his closet _meta_end_dot_

 one of my friends who is not a romney supporter once quipped to me that he doesn t think romney even has a closet _meta_end_dot_

 it is highly likely that our nominee will be running against one of the more scandal ridden public figures of the last _meta_number_ref_ years it is important that we not nominate a candidate who lives in a glass house _meta_end_dot_

 it is also important that we nominate a candidate who can carry the mantle of life in the face of hostile opposition _meta_end_dot_

 over the last three decades pro lifers have made important incremental gains in turning the tide of public opinion in this country _meta_end_dot_

 a large part of the reason for that is that we have with the exception of _meta_number_ref_ years of clinton had folks with the white house bully pulpit who took the side of life _meta_end_dot_

 now is not the time to go in reverse _meta_end_dot_

 one of the things that i often hear with respect to mitt romney is that people doubt his sincerity on this issue _meta_end_dot_

 i d like to encourage everyone to watch this video which is old but which i watched myself for the first time last weekend _meta_end_dot_

 if you are short on time begin at around the _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ mark _meta_end_dot_

 and i have to tell you after watching this video i came to believe for the first time during this campaign that romney s conversion on life was a real and genuine event i have wondered throughout this campaign how so many conservative leaders went into one on one meetings with romney and came out with this conclusion now i know again not enough to convince everyone maybe but enough to convince me _meta_end_dot_

 and i think frankly that if romney let this guy out more often rather than the carefully scripted person we see on tv more people might come to believe it as well _meta_end_dot_

 and finally let me speak frankly about something that i wish wasn t true but is _meta_end_dot_

 the public at large and independents in particular have caricatures in their own mind about what the bad republicans and democrats look like _meta_end_dot_

 the democrat caricature is the coddled northeastern stuffy wealthy liberal _meta_end_dot_

 when the democrats nominated the archetype of this caricature in _meta_number_ref_ republicans used that to their very great advantage _meta_end_dot_

 the republican caricature is the good old boy southern bible thumper _meta_end_dot_

 as a good old boy southern bible thumper i obviously don t have any problem with good old boy southern bible thumpers but i think it would be disastrous to nominate one this time around _meta_end_dot_

 independent voters a lot of them at least are coming around to the belief that the republican party is using the issues that are important to this voting demographic as a wedge issue to cover up the fact that they are not capable of governing well _meta_end_dot_

 our next candidate if he is going to win will have to walk a very fine line of projecting competence in governing as his main priority while sharing the values that we hold dear _meta_end_dot_

 i believe that mitt romney is the only candidate who can successfully accomplish that goal _meta_end_dot_

 the most important thing for me however is that wherever the candidates stand from issue to issue i believe that mitt romney will make the best president of the group _meta_end_dot_

 i believe that he will be the best person at managing the monster that is the federal bureaucracy shrinking its size and advancing conservative causes wherever there is opportunity _meta_end_dot_

 this country and this party need mitt romney _meta_end_dot_
