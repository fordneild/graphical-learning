  i m simply mad as a wet hen over this ladies and gentlemen _meta_end_dot_

 i know that erick and moe have already posted on this remark from obama i m biting my tongue _meta_end_exclamation_

 none of the words that spring readily to mind by way of describing this attitude are printable here _meta_end_dot_

 obama has literally told the chinese in quite so many words that he will defer to their strength when negotiating critical issues regarding global economic competition _meta_end_dot_

 depending on how overvalued you think the yuan is and how credible you think their official statistics are china s economy is still anywhere from one fourth to one half the size of ours _meta_end_dot_

 that gives us power in the relationship _meta_end_dot_

 but they have the growth the initiative and a rational foreign policy which gives them power _meta_end_dot_

 in such a case you negotiate straight ahead you trade strength for strength and you fight dirty when necessary _meta_end_dot_

 as the lord is my witness the chinese have fought dirty continue to fight dirty and have absolutely no compunction about fighting dirty in the future _meta_end_dot_

 what you don t do is say that you don t want to tell them they re wrong and then enumerate the reasons why you shouldn t _meta_end_dot_

 obama gains power by his calm elegance and his air of relaxed authority _meta_end_dot_

 he s starting the game holding great cards _meta_end_dot_

 so why on earth would he fold ahead of time _meta_end_question_

 this is a blunder that he will never be able to get back _meta_end_dot_
