  another day another bizarre pronouncement from hugo chavez however for those who might argue that this story is unworthy of mention i would posit that chavez s extreme overreaction concerning the mistaken cnn story can give rise to an immensely fun parlor game to be played in newsrooms across america _meta_end_dot_

 various media outlets can broadcast or print erroneous reports concerning the venezuelan dictator and then pop popcorn sit back and wait for the inevitable blowup _meta_end_dot_

 they can spice things up by placing bets as to what the general or specific nature of the blowup can be _meta_end_dot_

 my interested in economics self would even advocate the creation of an online futures market to track chavezista emotional meltdowns _meta_end_dot_

 fun could be had by all _meta_end_exclamation_
