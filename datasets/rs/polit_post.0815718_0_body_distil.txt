  after all he s happy enough to declare similar activities in iraq failures and never mind such piddling little details like objective reality via instapundit of course if obama does come out against this he ll have to explain to his super delegate harry thomas jr _meta_end_dot_

 why this plan of the councilman s is doomed to failure so i expect that the junior senator from illinois will handle the situation by ignoring it for as long as possible and then fire a staffer _meta_end_dot_
