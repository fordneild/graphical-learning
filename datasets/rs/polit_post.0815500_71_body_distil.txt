  please read this transcript of an interview with barack obama on his faith spirituality with chicago sun time religion columnist cathleen falsani _meta_end_dot_

 it is full of interesting tidbits like this and this his tune is a little different now _meta_end_dot_

 more below _meta_end_dot_

 but here is something interesting that struck me try and find anything in that interview that would convince you that obama holds the theology of a mainstream christian _meta_end_dot_

 obama said in his press conference announcing that he was leaving trinity that he didn t think his conventional faith would be subject to such scrutiny maybe it is because his faith isn t so conventional _meta_end_dot_

 this is not to suggest that there is something wrong politically with being heterodox theologically but i do find it interesting that obama is constantly trying to reassure people that he is just a regular christian trying to apply his faith to his life and work _meta_end_dot_

 but they seem far from conventional based on what we have learned _meta_end_dot_

 and this is the troubling pattern that develops with obama nothing is as it seems _meta_end_dot_

 he campaigns as a unifying figure who can bring the country together but has a history as a leftist activist with connections to radical and unsavory characters _meta_end_dot_

 he is presented as the messianic political figure and rhetorical magician and yet he is a full time gaffe machine thee days _meta_end_dot_

 it seems his faith and church are just one more area where obama s calm demeanor and charming personality hide a more radical reality _meta_end_dot_
