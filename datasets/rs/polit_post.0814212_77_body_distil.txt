  under pressure from the fanaticism and treachery of the jihad which is abetted by the peculiar manias of liberalism free speech is perishing _meta_end_dot_

 in canada a sordid drama continues with mark steyn actually managing to maneuver his accusers into a public confrontation which naturally did not turn out well for these individuals the confrontation begins about two thirds of the way into the video _meta_end_dot_

 but it probably doesn t matter on june _meta_number_ref_ mr _meta_end_dot_

 steyn and the magazine that published him are compelled to answer to the charge of flagrant islamophobia before another human rights commission this time in british columbia _meta_end_dot_

 more trials may follow including a federal tribunal which is said to boast a _meta_percent_ref_ conviction rate on hate speech cases _meta_end_dot_

 the thing is under the tyranny of these human rights tribunals there really can be no defense _meta_end_dot_

 steyn quotes a canadian justice department summary of the situation the defences of truth and fair comment remain available to torts such as defamation and seditious libel regardless of the medium in which they occur _meta_end_dot_

 however defences that may be available in tort actions are not available in cases of hate propaganda because the prohibition is concerned with adverse effects not with intent steyn comments now my view of free speech admittedly is somewhat ambivalent _meta_end_dot_

 as a general proposition concerning political speech i endorse it as an absolute proposition with compass over anything remotely associated with human expression i decline to endorse it and indeed stand ready to oppose it where absolutism threatens to conjure anarchy _meta_end_dot_

 the particular insanity of our day is that liberals who tend toward the absolutist position are it seems sufficiently blind to the obliteration of free speech augured by human rights tribunals that they cannot see the flat contradiction that stares them in the face _meta_end_dot_

 islam and grievance mongering will destroy one of their most cherished principles and our dear dear liberals may not even notice _meta_end_dot_
