  one knew of course that at some point in time his passing would come _meta_end_dot_

 but one did not and does not have to like it _meta_end_dot_

 he defined and refined modern conservatism and made it the successful intellectual force it is in american politics and society _meta_end_dot_

 he engaged his opponents with wit flair and an enviable intelligence _meta_end_dot_

 he was wrong about certain things but he righted those wrongs and did so comprehensively _meta_end_dot_

 and he was right about so many things from the get go including most notably the need to remove the john birchers from the modern conservative movement _meta_end_dot_

 his contemporaries did not think it possible that he would actually succeed in removing and marginalizing the birchers _meta_end_dot_

 he proved them wrong _meta_end_dot_

 and conservatism and america is better for it _meta_end_dot_

 lovely tributes abound _meta_end_dot_

 here s terry teachout _meta_end_dot_

 npr remembers it is ironic that buckley passed in a week in which npr s morning edition has been spending time talking to conservative leaders about the state of the movement today _meta_end_dot_

 this tribute of course is timeless _meta_end_dot_

 a panoply of remembrances are found here _meta_end_dot_

 and readers of varying political stripes remember _meta_end_dot_

 bill buckley s firing line a show of grace and passionate conversation ceased a long time ago a sign perhaps of the deteriorating tone and tenor of our national conversation _meta_end_dot_

 with buckley s own passing that deterioration alas continues apace _meta_end_dot_

 no one is in a position to revive buckley s intelligent and civilized approach to discussing the issues of the day _meta_end_dot_

 indeed most pundits of power and influence appear resolved to being the anti buckleys ill mannered brutes whose lack of courtesy is matched by a lack of intellect _meta_end_dot_

 we will miss william f _meta_end_dot_

 buckley jr _meta_end_dot_

 for all that he was _meta_end_dot_

 we will also miss him for all that he was not _meta_end_dot_

 we will miss this man who made the times and we will miss the times he made _meta_end_dot_

 one need not be especially nostalgic to remember that there was a period not too long ago in american life when conversations were pleasant and enlightening affairs _meta_end_dot_

 and one must be blind not to see that this period has passed and its exact antithesis has replaced it _meta_end_dot_

 rest in peace mr _meta_end_dot_

 buckley _meta_end_dot_

 you were the herald of a better time _meta_end_dot_

 for that alone you shall be warmly remembered _meta_end_dot_
