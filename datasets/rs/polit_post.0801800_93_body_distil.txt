  well i m back from south carolina _meta_end_dot_

 it was a fun two days _meta_end_dot_

 i rode on the bus i was the only non campaign non family member on the bus this morning talked to the candidate and i got to meet my hero campaign carl cameron _meta_end_dot_

 yes he is that cool _meta_end_dot_

 in any event from the ground it seems objectively clear that fred thompson has momentum _meta_end_dot_

 while still third or fourth in polling he is trending up enough that the national media has taken notice and has started paying more attention to him _meta_end_dot_

 at events in rural areas today despite sleet snow and ice thompson saw large crowds _meta_end_dot_

 likewise huckabee has escalated his attacks _meta_end_dot_

 this bears with conventional wisdom from reporters i talked to who have said they are seeing huckabee going down and thompson going up in the polling _meta_end_dot_

 it may very well be too late _meta_end_dot_

 but with romney ceding the field and huckabee going down it may be possible _meta_end_dot_

 one thing that is clear conservatives are making up their mind and as they do thompson is going up _meta_end_dot_
