  there wasn t much coverage of general petraeus when he appeared before the senate armed services committee last thursday _meta_end_dot_

 even c span didn t show it live _meta_end_dot_

 petraeus reported that violence is at a _meta_number_ref_ year low and that he will likely reduce troop levels this september after the _meta_number_ref_ day pause _meta_end_dot_

 his comments were more upbeat than six weeks ago when the basra offensive was in full flux but he is still cautionary about the political situation _meta_end_dot_

 here is what he said about al sadr and basra _meta_end_dot_

 there s more on the success of the basra offensive and other stuff below the fold _meta_end_dot_

 even the new york times is acknowledging the turnaround in basra but the writer seems befuddled about how it happened _meta_end_dot_

 here s my answer clear _meta_end_dot_

 hold _meta_end_dot_

 build _meta_end_dot_

 the brits played the caretaker role in southern iraq but the reality is that they took care of nothing except for avoiding getting shot at _meta_end_dot_

 the basra offensive improved al maliki s political standing which has enabled him to take on al sadr s home base in sadr city and the last urban al qaeda stronghold in mosul _meta_end_dot_

 a hat tip to amy proctor for the video _meta_end_dot_

 going by roggio sadr city is still in the clearing and holding phase but they should start building soon _meta_end_dot_

 muqtada al sadr gets quite a bit of support from sadr city residents because his group provides services and security _meta_end_dot_

 with the iraqi army and related groups doing the same al sadr s usefulness and relevance are reduced _meta_end_dot_

 here s how dr _meta_end_dot_

 irack describes the mosul operation on the al qaeda front u s _meta_end_dot_

 ambassador crocker said yesterday that the terrorist group has never been closer to defeat than they are now a little over a year ago this is what a certain defeatist democratic senator from nevada said _meta_end_dot_

 the extreme violence yesterday that gloomy reid was talking about was a series of four suicide bombings that killed _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 thirteen months ago harry reid was ready and willing to surrender because of al qaeda s evil acts _meta_end_dot_

 now al qaeda is the one approaching defeat _meta_end_dot_

 reid also said this as long as we follow the president s path in iraq the war is lost _meta_end_dot_

 but there is still a chance to change course and we must change course bush had changed course two months prior to reid s statements but reid s version of changing course was and perhaps still is unilateral cut and run _meta_end_dot_

 there s even more building taking place in southern iraq and iraqi airways just signed a multi billion dollar order with boeing for a fleet of new passenger jets _meta_end_dot_

 next week the iranian foreign minister and a syrian envoy will attend un meetings in sweden for the iraq compact annual review which will make this a forum where u s _meta_end_dot_

 officials can talk to a couple of adversarial nations _meta_end_dot_

 more on the international compact with iraq here _meta_end_dot_

 none of the above means that all of al qaeda or special groups or rogue jam militias are defeated _meta_end_dot_

 i m sure quite a few have melted away some leaving or quitting but others waiting to fight another day _meta_end_dot_

 also the truce between al sadr and the iraqi government is fragile and tenuous _meta_end_dot_

 but al sadr is in a weak position which was exposed as early as last august when he stood down his militias after the mess in karbala _meta_end_dot_

 also none of this means that i believed we ve turned the corner or that we re winning in iraq _meta_end_dot_

 there s plenty left to accomplish _meta_end_dot_

 although political strides have been made more benchmarks need to be reached and more security needs to take hold and more building needs to take place _meta_end_dot_
