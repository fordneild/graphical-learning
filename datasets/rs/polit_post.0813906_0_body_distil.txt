  according to reuters this rapporteur is a senegalese lawyer who has served since _meta_number_ref_ as a representative of the u n _meta_end_dot_

 human rights council an organization that has previously condemned the u s _meta_end_dot_

 for several perceived violations of its standards for the western world not to be confused with its lack of standards for countries that it knows won t listen to it anyway _meta_end_dot_

 clearly life in senegal is so idyllic and free of problems that mr _meta_end_dot_

 diene is on excellent footing to be looking into the united states affairs _meta_end_dot_

 mr _meta_end_dot_

 diene by the way is the same captain obvious who presented the unhrc with a report last year complaining that islamophobia had grown worldwide since the september _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ attacks on the united states no freaking kidding _meta_end_dot_

 thanks for that mr _meta_end_dot_

 diene _meta_end_dot_

 by the way i sincerely doubt that the word phobia applies when it is a skepticism and willingness to deal with an actual threat not that such a distinction would likely be able to work its way through the nice thick walls of your turtle bay based ivory tower _meta_end_dot_

 oh and i doubt that your being from a muslim country had any bearing on your perception regarding and sensitivity toward the fact that the sentient world actually does realize that nearly all of those behind terrorism are in fact muslim _meta_end_dot_
