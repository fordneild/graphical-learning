  has an article this morning on the blue dogs _meta_end_dot_

 one of them is nick lampson running against redstate endorsed pete olson _meta_end_dot_

 that of course cannot cover up for years of being a party line toeing liberal and for voting for nancy pelosi as speaker _meta_end_dot_

 in _meta_number_ref_ lampson only won with _meta_percent_ref_ of the vote in a disaster of an election for shelley sekula gibbs who redstate helped toss out in the primary _meta_end_dot_

 the district went for bush with _meta_percent_ref_ in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 this is a very middle class to upper middle class district that is ripe for the gop to take it back _meta_end_dot_

 the cook partisan voting index puts it at r _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 lampson is probably the most vulnerable of the democrats in the house _meta_end_dot_

 his opponent pete olson is a veteran and he is backed by phil freakin gramm _meta_end_dot_

 he ll be a dependable conservative vote _meta_end_dot_

 folks we can beat nick lampson pretty damn easily but we need to cough up some change for pete olson to get this seat back _meta_end_dot_

 it may be one of the only seats we do get back so let s make it count _meta_end_dot_
