 love the comparison senator joe biden declares iraq troop buildup a failure as reported by the associate press via foxnews com _meta_end_dot_

 during the weekly democratic radio address yesterday he said the eternally optimistic leader later added although somewhat subdued this time senator biden s comments are a clear preemptive strike against general petraeus scheduled report to congress this coming week _meta_end_dot_

 the democrat congressional leadership simply cannot weather another positive report about progress in iraq _meta_end_dot_

 read on _meta_end_dot_

 senator biden is not the only one to warn against reporting anything positive _meta_end_dot_

 house speaker nancy pelosi forewarned general petraeus against putting a positive spin on the recent uprising of shiite militants in iraq _meta_end_dot_

 from politico com speaker pelosi says not surprisingly she also lets us know who she thinks is in charge of iraq hint it s not the iraqi government nor the u s _meta_end_dot_

 military _meta_end_dot_

 i know this has been done before but let s check the current score _meta_end_dot_

 results based on the daily standard iraq s seven legislative benchmarks _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 enacting and implementing legislation on de baathification _meta_end_dot_

 done passed by cor on january _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ approved by presidency council in february _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 enacting and implementing legislation to ensure the equitable distribution of hydrocarbon resources of the people of iraq without regard to the sect or ethnicity of recipients and enacting and implementing legislation to ensure that the energy resources of iraq benefit sunni arabs shia arabs kurds and other iraqi citizens equitably _meta_end_dot_

 not done it should be noted that although legislation is still hung up oil revenues are currently being equitably distributed to the various ethnic groups in the interim _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 enacting and implementing legislation on procedures to form semi autonomous regions _meta_end_dot_

 underway the kurdish regional government is up and running and a law has been passed that would allow provinces to form regions after april _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 enacting and implementing legislation establishing an independent high electoral commission provincial elections law provincial council authorities and a date for provincial elections _meta_end_dot_

 done passed by cor on february _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ vetoed by vice president adel abdul mehdi on february _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ veto withdrawn and law approved by presidency council on march _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 enacting and implementing legislation addressing amnesty _meta_end_dot_

 done passed by cor on february _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ signed by presidency council on february _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 enacting and implementing legislation establishing a strong militia disarmament program to ensure that such security forces are accountable only to the central government and loyal to the constitution of iraq _meta_end_dot_

 done laws have been passed and decrees have been issued declaring that only the iraqi security forces isf are legitimate armed forces _meta_end_dot_

 the movement of former insurgents into concerned local citizens groups is a major part of accomplishing this task _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 forming a constitutional review committee and then completing the constitutional review _meta_end_dot_

 underway cor formed a constitutional review committee in september _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 it was originally supposed to report back in may _meta_number_ref_ and submitted a draft but has since been granted an extension through august _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 on the other hand most of the key provisions in the iraqi constitution requiring review involve the rest of the benchmark legislation so this can be fairly said to be underway _meta_end_dot_

 so there you have it _meta_end_dot_

 four benchmarks met two underway and one not met even though results of intended legislation are already being met _meta_end_dot_

 now on to the fun part _meta_end_dot_

 in _meta_number_ref_ the new democratic majority in congress committed to six for _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 this new direction for america listed six legislative benchmarks for the _meta_number_ref_th congress _meta_end_dot_

 these six legislative goals were to be completed in the first _meta_number_ref_ days _meta_end_dot_

 it s been more than _meta_number_ref_ days and yet they are woefully lacking even in comparison to the iraqi government _meta_end_dot_

 the following is my own analysis _meta_end_dot_

 democrat s six for _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 national security _meta_end_dot_

 not done the cut and run strategy of the democrats has been a dismal failure _meta_end_dot_

 rather than getting troops out of iraq the number of troops has risen significantly during their tenure _meta_end_dot_

 they have also failed to renew the intelligence gathering bill leaving our country more vulnerable to terrorist attack _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 jobs and wages _meta_end_dot_

 partial they successfully raised the national minimum wage but in doing so have caused businesses to cut jobs to make up the difference and try to do more with less _meta_end_dot_

 unemployment filings were up last month to a four year high _meta_end_dot_

 the economy is slowing and true to form they ve refused to extend or make permanent the bush tax cuts thereby causing businesses to slow investments in new business _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 energy independence _meta_end_dot_

 not done so far they ve passed laws requiring turning food into fuel ethanol turning mercury into landfill fodder fluorescent light bulbs and raising cafe standards without requiring alternative energy usage _meta_end_dot_

 none of this will have any effect whatsoever towards energy independence _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 affordable health care _meta_end_dot_

 not done deafening silence _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 retirement security _meta_end_dot_

 not done nothing has been done towards social security and medicare reform _meta_end_dot_

 tax increases have been their only proposals which will only delay the inevitable bankruptcy of the system _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 college access for all _meta_end_dot_

 not done more silence _meta_end_dot_

 no changes have been made towards making college available to more people _meta_end_dot_

 if and when they do finally make more money available for tuition it ll only drive up the cost of education and likely shut out even more middle class people from attending _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 the most honest ethical and open congress in history _meta_end_dot_

 i added the last one since this was a direct quote from speaker nancy pelosi _meta_end_dot_

 honesty the lies never stop _meta_end_dot_

 from denying progress in iraq to intentionally maligning the top general and commander in chief during a time of war _meta_end_dot_

 ethical several times they tried to put memebers in positions of authority that were under review for or had already committed ethics violations _meta_end_dot_

 one of their current members is under indictment for bribery _meta_end_dot_

 open a flat out in your face refusal to end the practice of quietly and secretly tacking on billions of dollars of hometown pork projects into spending bills _meta_end_dot_

 well there you have it _meta_end_dot_

 a fair comparison of the legislative progress by the iraqi and our own legislatures _meta_end_dot_

 here s the scorecard u s _meta_end_dot_

 congress _meta_number_ref_ completed _meta_number_ref_ partially completed _meta_number_ref_ not completed _meta_end_dot_

 iraqi government _meta_number_ref_ completed _meta_number_ref_ partially completed _meta_number_ref_ not completed _meta_end_dot_

 it should be noted that for the iraqi government these benchmarks were dictated to them _meta_end_dot_

 for our own congress they were selected by the very leaders that have failed to carry them out _meta_end_dot_

 i m starting to agree that the cut and run strategy may be the best choice but only from the legislative body that has failed to meet any of their benchmarks _meta_end_dot_
