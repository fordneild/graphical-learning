  or at least a schradenfreudist if that s even a word _meta_end_dot_

 anyway these two authors saw no reason to beat around the bush via instapundit but don t feel completely bad about this _meta_end_exclamation_

 as the article notes democrats will close the year touting a historic increase in fuel mileage standards hikes in pell grants lobbying and ethics reform and the first minimum wage increase in a decade _meta_end_exclamation_

 after all isn t that what the progressives really spent all that money and time on in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_question_

 student loan availability _meta_end_question_

 read on _meta_end_dot_

 as you might have noticed i love writing these kinds of posts not least of which is because back in november _meta_number_ref_ i was glumly certain that the new democratic congress was going to go rampaging through our foreign policy _meta_end_dot_

 fortunately i had underestimated the willingness of gop congressmen to back the president s play on the war slightly underestimated the president s stubbornness when it came to implementing policy on the war and drastically underestimated the way that democratic congressmen would fold up like cheap seats at the first sign of opposition _meta_end_dot_

 i claim the excuse of extreme worry clouding my judgment on the first and second items but i still don t quite comprehend the third at least i don t see how it s consistent with their rhetoric _meta_end_dot_

 congressional democrats could have pushed harder on iraq _meta_end_dot_

 in fact i m flattering them by implying that they pushed at all an outside observer might have a different opinion _meta_end_dot_

 they didn t which is _meta_end_dot_

 fascinating in its implications _meta_end_dot_

 they also could have placed themselves in a position where they could take credit for the change in tactics that we ve dumbed down by calling the surge they still could do that in fact _meta_end_dot_

 given that the change in tactics is apparently working they are probably quietly eager to do that _meta_end_dot_

 except of course that they can t _meta_end_dot_

 the establishment democrats running the party would find themselves instantly at war with the progressive faction of their base voters if they did _meta_end_dot_

 the left sphere would be overjoyed to lead the charge they may hate us as convenient devil figures but they have plenty of fear and blind rage left over for the apostates and weak sisters that supposedly keep them from their due _meta_end_dot_

 so the democrats are in a bit of a pickle there they know that following the netroots lead will lead them further away from the mainstream just in time for an election year and they can t reintegrate with the mainstream because the netroots are standing athwart their way blustering stop i just can t see how the establishment democrats are going to get out of that one _meta_end_dot_
