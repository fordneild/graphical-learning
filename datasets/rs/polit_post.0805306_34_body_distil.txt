  guest blogging over at andrew sullivan s place peter suderman uncritically quotes a comment stating that barack obama is robert rubin on trade pretty much keep it open but help workers interesting _meta_end_dot_

 of course robert rubin didn t bash nafta and blame it for everything bad that has ever happened since human beings learned to walk upright _meta_end_dot_

 no that is barack obama s province and while i suspect that the good senator doesn t know or doesn t care about the facts robert rubin credit where it is due always did show that he possessed a strong and comprehensive understanding of the ways in which we are enriched by participating in a free trade system _meta_end_dot_

 look i know that austan goolsbee is advising barack obama _meta_end_dot_

 and i know that austan goolsbee is a good guy _meta_end_dot_

 but when it comes to trade chicago boys like austan goolsbee are not being listened to by barack obama _meta_end_dot_

 someone needs to point that out _meta_end_dot_

 the health of our trade policies and our economy as a whole may depend on it _meta_end_dot_
