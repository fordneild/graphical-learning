  not that anybody in the right sphere wrote the below of course via primetime politics via instapundit but it s still a good line of attack it s never hard to sell the american voting public on the notion that democrats are perennial ditherers for much the same reason why it s never hard to sell the american voting public on the notion that alaska gets cold in the wintertime _meta_end_dot_

 there are also probably the usual humorless lefties out there right now preparing the usual humorless whines all the while not quite understanding that this is one of those funny because it s true situations _meta_end_dot_

 and it ll get funnier once some of those whines start circulating both because it ll reinforce yet another narrative you can bet that _meta_percent_ref_ of those whines will be from obama supporters like calls to like and because it ll help spread the first one nicely _meta_end_dot_

 all in all not bad message placement _meta_end_dot_
