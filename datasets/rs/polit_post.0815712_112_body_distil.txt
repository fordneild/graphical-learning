  some of my friends believe this article from pmsnbc is nothing more than pre emptive whining on the part of the obamessiah _meta_end_dot_

 i sort of agree but all the same i can only laugh at how hard the little kid from illinois is working to define how the general election campaign will be run on his terms _meta_end_dot_

 he seems to be of the opinion that pre emptively whining over what republicans might say about him allows for him to say later asked and answered _meta_end_dot_

 while his buds in the american idol media will come out with some gibberish along the lines of old news no story giggling yo barry _meta_end_question_

 he says this phht we re not going to paint you as a risky choice we re going to paint you as the worst thing that could ever possibly happen to our republic _meta_end_dot_
