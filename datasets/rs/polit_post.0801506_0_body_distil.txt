  noted as a followup to my piece on democratic proposals to stimulate the economy federal reserve chairman ben bernanke and house speaker nancy pelosi had a sitdown today _meta_end_dot_

 the subject was a package of legislative items designed to stimulate the economy which presumably means to forestall the recession that many people consider likely this year _meta_end_dot_

 pelosi s in favor _meta_end_dot_

 bernanke made a few happy noises _meta_end_dot_

 more _meta_end_dot_

 from the bloomberg story so from this you might infer that bernanke whose opinion matters unlike pelosi s is in favor of the democrat led legislative plan _meta_end_dot_

 except that neither the democratic aide who leaked the story to bloomberg nor the fed s spokeswoman said that bernanke had anything specific to say about it _meta_end_dot_

 i think it s more likely that the fed chairman was just being sociable while meeting with the speaker on her turf _meta_end_dot_

 i also think pelosi was trying to borrow his credibility for whatever she and her peeps are cooking up _meta_end_dot_

 as recently as last week bernanke said his thoughts on the subject of keynesian stimulus in the current environment were inchoate the endlessly quoted helicopter remarks he made in a speech a few years back had to do with monetary policy rather than fiscal policy the democrats led by house banking committee chairman barney frank want to start spending a big pile of money right now on the theory that better economic conditions will then ensue _meta_end_dot_

 they want to spend it on a one time tax rebate unspecified handouts to lower income people and some good old fashioned pork barrel spending _meta_end_dot_

 no word on how this is going to be financed however which may be one of the reasons bernanke wasn t too impressed _meta_end_dot_

 there are two ways for the democrats to go on this _meta_end_dot_

 they can bust the budget which is what congressional republicans want them to do or they can offset the stimulus spending with a variety of tax increases which the democrats would dearly love to do _meta_end_dot_

 neither alternative is any good and bernanke knows it _meta_end_dot_

 in addition i ll bet you that in his heart of hearts he knows very well that the problems facing this economy are complex enough to make any kind of policy response dangerous _meta_end_dot_

 that s the other reason i think he was noncommittal _meta_end_dot_

 it s also why the fed for their part have carefully hedged their official statements in the last few months to emphasize that the potential for inflation may be just as high as the risk of a slowdown in output _meta_end_dot_

 what none of these powerful people can afford however is for an adverse outcome to occur in the economy after they chose to do nothing _meta_end_dot_

 politics is like that and the administration for its part is in the same boat _meta_end_dot_

 some details started leaking out today about what president bush and treasury secretary paulson would like to see in a stimulus package _meta_end_dot_

 as i expected it s basically a lite version of the democratic plan the funny thing is this nancy pelosi and george bush are accountable to the american people through the filter of the mainstream press _meta_end_dot_

 as long as they do something whatever it is they won t have to answer any tough questions if things get really bad _meta_end_dot_

 and of course if things don t get really bad they ll gleefully take credit for saving the american economy bernanke on the other hand is closely watched by the smartest people in the world _meta_end_dot_

 he can t just do something he knows that nothing or nearly nothing is probably the best policy course on the fiscal side which is the government s side together with measured interest rate cuts on the monetary side which is his side _meta_end_dot_

 he also knows that he will be blamed if he blesses a fiscal plan that does more harm than good _meta_end_dot_
