  it may have just gotten a little shorter believes that fidel castro will not survive the bush administration _meta_end_dot_

 i can only hope that castro lives long enough to see cuba regain its freedom at long last _meta_end_dot_

 given the state of his health that would not take long and beyond that i couldn t possibly care less what happens to the despicable destructive tyrant _meta_end_dot_

 cuba cannot be rid of him too soon _meta_end_dot_
