  please observe a moment of silence in your heart today to remember the thousands of young people murdered with tanks and soldiers by the chinese government on june _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 this is the same government that in two months will put on the biggest show in the world the beijing olympic games in an attempt to convince you and everyone else that they are all grown up now and deserve a place in the front rank of the world s nations _meta_end_dot_

 craving legitimacy and a permanent hold on power and fearful above all of freedom of speech and of thought the chinese regime turned after the tiananmen massacre to delivering economic prosperity instead _meta_end_dot_

 they have done that _meta_end_dot_

 and yet i call on you dear reader do not ever forget the brutality of a communist regime that out of fear and insecurity was unable to tolerate the peaceful gathering of unarmed students who wanted nothing more than freedom a blessing that you enjoy every single day _meta_end_dot_

 perhaps you even take your freedom for granted _meta_end_dot_
