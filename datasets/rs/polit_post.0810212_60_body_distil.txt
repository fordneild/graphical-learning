  like ed morrissey i ll grant this right off the bat senator obama s taking the high ground on this one _meta_end_dot_

 while what he s refusing to do is actually legal it s not particularly ethical either and doing it would clash horribly with his perceived campaign style _meta_end_dot_

 not doing it is a risk for him so if it works out he s going to reap considerable political benefits from it _meta_end_dot_

 if it doesn t work out he doesn t just lose pa _meta_end_dot_

 he loses pa filthy _meta_end_dot_

 read on _meta_end_dot_

 i d read the entire article it breaks down what could be a very real problem for the obama campaign _meta_end_dot_

 the short version philadelphia democratic party officials supporting one candidate or another expect the national campaigns to pass along cash to defray costs which they then pass along to their street level staff _meta_end_dot_

 we re not talking about actual vote buying at least not officially merely paying people to put up flyers knock on doors man tables outside of polling stations filling up their gas tanks so that they can transport voters to polls giving them incentives to get people registered and voting that sort of thing _meta_end_dot_

 iffy if only because some of that money is probably but deniably being traded directly for votes but it s the custom and philadelphia democrats know and count on it _meta_end_dot_

 the obama currently has no intention of honoring that custom i would be shocked if the clinton campaign didn t look at that item in the budget and double the amount allocated _meta_end_dot_

 this has the potential to be a real problem for obama _meta_end_dot_

 from the article campbell goes on to say that she could not in good conscience ask people to work for obama for free couple that with this and you end up with a situation that s lose lose _meta_end_dot_

 the last thing that obama needs is a philadelphia that doesn t break strongly for him it s his best chance for victory or at least a single digit loss _meta_end_dot_

 existing expectations from polling results which aren t taking this practice in account would magnify every point by which he loses and the media s unlikely to dwell overmuch on why he lost _meta_end_dot_

 the temptation to just spend the five hundred grand to prevent that must be powerful _meta_end_dot_

 except that the obama campaign s policy has not been to pay out street money and changing it now will be seen legitimately as being the abandonment of principle to expediency _meta_end_dot_

 and frankly he s had enough hits to his halo in the last two months to be able to afford very many more of them _meta_end_dot_

 my advice _meta_end_question_

 tough one _meta_end_dot_

 ethically he s better off not spreading around the street money pragmatically he needs to spread it around even more lavishly than hillary will _meta_end_dot_

 either way benefits the gop in the long run so i guess that he should pick the option that lets him sleep better at night _meta_end_dot_

 after firing the people who lost him california and ohio of course _meta_end_dot_

 if it weren t for them he d not be in this mess right now _meta_end_dot_

 moe lane whether you consider it un ethical depends in large part on whether you were counting on some of that money i suppose and what you were expected to do in exchange for it _meta_end_dot_
