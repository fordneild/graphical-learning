  the political hacks at moveon org recently teamed up with other hacks from a variety of disciplines such as ben affleck acting markos moulitsas blogging oliver stone directing and eddie vedder thinking among others to run a contest designed to get regular people to create their advertising for them _meta_end_dot_

 the contest obama in _meta_number_ref_ seconds was judged by the above and other entertainment and media has beens and also rans and was designed to find really creative ads that will engage and enlighten viewers and help them understand the grassroots energy that s driving barack obama s campaign moveon and i agree that if anything in the political world requires explanation to be understood it s the obamanauts _meta_end_dot_

 the winner has been announced and now that moveon has their free ad they re looking for regular people to come up with their advertising money as well asking site visitors to chip in to put john s story on the air the ad features john weiler a self described lifelong republican who is voting for barack obama and working with moveon org if i may emphasize that point _meta_end_dot_

 the lifelong republican _meta_end_dot_

 working with moveon _meta_end_dot_

 just sayin _meta_end_dot_

 the moveon site describes his story as powerful let s watch _meta_end_dot_

 i m literally choking up right now _meta_end_dot_

 someone strong in washington who is going to represent everybody all the liberals and conservatives and bloggers and blessed cheese makers and splenda packets and charlie the unicorn _meta_end_exclamation_

 reagan and flags _meta_end_exclamation_

 lifelong republican _meta_end_exclamation_

 vote for obama _meta_end_exclamation_

 _meta_end_dot_

 powerful stuff _meta_end_dot_

 the thrill in my leg is outdone only by the wetness of my joy tears _meta_end_dot_

 the ad naturally features no serious discussion of obama the candidate opting instead to focus on the nebulous platitudinous themes of obamania _meta_end_dot_

 in that the obamacan ad reminds of this one obamacan would fit in nicely there _meta_end_dot_

 somebody that s gonna represent the left and the right both democrat and republican _meta_end_dot_

 everybody _meta_end_dot_

 obama s gonna make a world without spiders in a fantastic bit of self referential humor one of the judges for the video contest was moby _meta_end_dot_

 yes that moby _meta_end_dot_

 think about that for a second _meta_end_dot_

 the theme of the video is the obamacan and moby is a judge _meta_end_dot_

 for those less than in the know a moby is someone who pretends at being republican or conservative in order to either sow discontent or make pathetic attempts at persuading from the inside how fitting that the original moby selects obamacan as the contest winner _meta_end_dot_

 i m for chipping in to get this on the air _meta_end_dot_

 it provides the same joke that the super deluxe video provides only the obamacan doesn t seem to get it _meta_end_dot_

 lifelong republican _meta_end_exclamation_

 candy mountain charlie _meta_end_exclamation_
