  after years of feeding my habit this political tv junkie finally suffered from total absolute burnout _meta_end_dot_

 i became tired of the same talking heads babbling about the same sets of talking points the pundits who were almost always wrong and when they were proven wrong would go on to explain why things didn t go as they should have and the strategists who shared their machiavellian concepts with the rest of us _meta_end_dot_

 i couldn t take one more split screen set of so called experts yelling at each other pontificating and prognosticating _meta_end_dot_

 i had it up to here with cnn and fox news and msnbc _meta_end_dot_

 i couldn t bear the superficial interviews on the network morning shows or the self important musings of the nightly newscasts _meta_end_dot_

 i became sick of the polls and the stories about the polls and the analyses of the polls _meta_end_dot_

 so i quit _meta_end_dot_

 cold turkey _meta_end_dot_

 no more news on television _meta_end_dot_

 none _meta_end_dot_

 no hardball no meet the press no good morning america _meta_end_dot_

 free at last free at last _meta_end_exclamation_

 thank god almighty i was free at last _meta_end_exclamation_

 so during this election cycle i have gained virtually all of my political news from written sources _meta_end_dot_

 as a result i ve found myself caring more about what has been said rather than how it was said _meta_end_dot_

 i no longer see nor do i miss the instant analysis that follows debates _meta_end_dot_

 i don t have to subject myself to on air advisors telling candidates what they must do to perform better in the next primary _meta_end_dot_

 in the print and online worlds there are so many more sources and options _meta_end_dot_

 the only shouting involves exclamation points and capital letters _meta_end_dot_

 the junk is easier to recognize and ignore _meta_end_dot_

 i ve even found myself reading the transcripts of debates rather than watching and listening to them which has allowed me to concentrate on substance and disregard the theatrics _meta_end_dot_

 there have been some absolutely moronic questions asked by debate moderators but if you think they sounded stupid on television you should read them _meta_end_dot_

 i feel more informed than ever and i find all the talk about the irrelevant aspects of the race to be well irrelevant _meta_end_dot_

 i m no longer a part of the electronic echo chamber and i m very happy _meta_end_dot_

 i may never go back _meta_end_dot_

 cross posted here _meta_end_dot_
