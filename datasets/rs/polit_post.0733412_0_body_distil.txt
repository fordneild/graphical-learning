  the beauty of this post stems not just from the post itself which is a sober response to a hyperpartisan attack on milton friedman but from the many comments as well that call daniel davies to account for his bizarre post _meta_end_dot_

 little by little davies s rationalizations and excuses fall to the side thanks to commenters who take him to task for his ill tempered and irrational rant _meta_end_dot_

 it s actually something of a joy to read through _meta_end_dot_
