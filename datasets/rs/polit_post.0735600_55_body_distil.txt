  but credit where it is due he is completely dead on accurate here _meta_end_dot_

 the problem hillary clinton faces is that if her husband does not campaign for her he will be seen as being jealous of her chance to be president and perhaps less than enthusiastic about her qualifications _meta_end_dot_

 when he does campaign for her however he really campaigns for himself and sucks all of the oxygen out of her efforts _meta_end_dot_

 hillary clinton could have combated all of this by being able to project a charismatic presence of her own _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 and by actually having tangible accomplishments to point to _meta_end_dot_

 alas she has neither the resume nor the charisma _meta_end_dot_

 she also doesn t have any compelling rationale for her candidacy other than it would be ever so cool if a former first lady gets elected as the first female president of the united states and all of that is coming back to haunt her _meta_end_dot_

 oh she is still competitive _meta_end_dot_

 and she still has a ruthless campaign staff that will likely help her get the nomination at the end of the day _meta_end_dot_

 but she may be plenty bloodied by the time that happens _meta_end_dot_

 and who knows _meta_end_question_

 on the final night of the democratic national convention it may well be barack obama who gives the final speech _meta_end_dot_
