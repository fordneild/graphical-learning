  _meta_dollor_ref_ million _meta_end_dot_

 that would be _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ more than john mccain did _meta_end_dot_

 yes we ll be expanding on this theme _meta_end_dot_

 first update the wsj reports _meta_dollor_ref_ million with _meta_dollor_ref_ million cash on hand _meta_end_dot_

 as per opensecrets org senator obama s take in april of _meta_number_ref_ was _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ million with _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ million on hand _meta_end_dot_

 this indicates a continuing drop in revenues plus the second month in a row where the obama campaign spent more money than it took in _meta_end_dot_

 please note that this is may s results not june s _meta_end_dot_

 the obama campaign was actively campaigning for the entire month of may against a determined opponent and his recent decision to break his word on accepting public financing argues that this month s totals will be significantly higher _meta_end_dot_

 that being said i personally was assuming that obama s cash on hand would not have dropped _meta_end_dot_

 mccain by the way raised _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ million and had _meta_dollor_ref_ million on hand in april _meta_end_dot_

 may s results were _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ million raised and _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ million in the bank both reasonable increases _meta_end_dot_
