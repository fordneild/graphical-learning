  yeah i stole that from terry pratchett _meta_end_dot_

 you knew that i was a geek when you started reading this _meta_end_dot_

 anyway you get the feeling that right now barry s main goal in life is to not vomit from the sheer weariness of it all _meta_end_dot_

 via hot air of course she did _meta_end_dot_

 read on _meta_end_dot_

 first off yeah senator clinton s so totally living off of other people s life force at this point isn t she _meta_end_question_

 i d be more worried about that except that she isn t eating anybody i know and frankly i m so far down her list that we d need to repeal the _meta_number_ref_nd amendment before i was in any real danger of having my soul consumed _meta_end_dot_

 never a dull moment in this primary let me tell you _meta_end_dot_

 and the best days are still to come _meta_end_dot_

 well best days for me and mine _meta_end_dot_

 second i know that it s mcclatchy and everything but he really is blaming email and fox news _meta_end_dot_

 now i understand that this is precisely what a lot of current obama supporters want to hear but there s a problem with that there aren t enough obama supporters to let him win the election _meta_end_dot_

 in case you haven t noticed there aren t enough obama supporters to let him decisively win the democratic primary by now the two parties are usually done at this point remember _meta_end_question_

 and by usually i mean as has been the case throughout my lifetime _meta_end_dot_

 he could possibly get more obama supporters in fact i assume that this would be his long term strategy _meta_end_dot_

 but if he wants to do that i think that he may want to consider not coming up with excuses about why people aren t going to vote for him in kentucky _meta_end_dot_

 or at least come up with excuses that might be a little closer to objective reality _meta_end_dot_

 now i can hear in the distance but _meta_end_dot_

 it s true _meta_end_exclamation_

 that really is why obama s going to lose kentucky _meta_end_exclamation_

 that awful fox news _meta_end_exclamation_

 those emails _meta_end_exclamation_

 well my response to that _meta_end_dot_

 is to grin evilly actually _meta_end_dot_

 after i m done doing that i might suggest gently that anyone who actually does think that might as well quit now because if obama s appeal to working class white voters can be so easily overridden by a news network s lack of idolatry and the existence of spam email chains he s doomed anyway _meta_end_dot_

 i might even suggest that his campaign should possibly restart from zero and actually connect with those working class white voters on their terms not his _meta_end_dot_

 might _meta_end_dot_

 it d all depend if i thought anybody on the other side had both the mother wit to take me seriously and the pull to do anything about it _meta_end_dot_

 the fact that you re seeing this should be taken as a suggestion that i ve decided that there s nobody with that combination thankfully _meta_end_dot_

 moe lane ps by the way senator if you miss so badly those carefree days where you could burrow down into one state and really get into the concerns fears and yes hopes of its citizens well i can think of at least one democrat who ll happily pay your airfare back to illinois _meta_end_dot_

 until then kindly suck it up would you _meta_end_question_

 we re choosing a president not the whiner in chief _meta_end_dot_
