  i assumed that simply because the status of tibet under the prc is a hot button issue for progressives and because the progressive movement is taking this opportunity to bring up the status of tibet loudly and because it is also a hot button issue that i happen to agree with i expected therefore that my endorsement of speaker pelosi and senator clinton s call for the president to boycott the opening ceremonies would be very likely shared by senator obama _meta_end_dot_

 silly me _meta_end_dot_

 i will admit surprise however _meta_end_dot_

 it seems such an obvious stance for the man to take _meta_end_dot_

 oh _meta_end_dot_

 pause it s like the man combines the worst qualities of the machine and reform politician _meta_end_dot_

 you get all of the mutual back scratching and none of the mutual loyalty and all of the self serving twaddle but none of the overriding moral sense _meta_end_dot_

 roll on august _meta_end_dot_
