  i presume that the dishonesty speaks for itself still don t know how to argue against him _meta_end_dot_

 he was a transformational figure via sullivan and his methods do provide politicians with a model on how to create a working majority _meta_end_dot_

 obama clearly realizes that and his realization poses a threat to the clintons since he is working to put himself in a position to do what they may not be able to do _meta_end_dot_

 therefore he must be stopped by any means necessary as far as the clintons are concerned _meta_end_dot_

 thus these fights _meta_end_dot_

 isn t it interesting that at long last democrats have come to realize that the clintons aren t exactly the nicest or most honest folk to come down the pipeline _meta_end_question_
