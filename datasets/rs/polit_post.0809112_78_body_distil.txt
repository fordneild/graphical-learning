  many of my colleagues profess to be bewildered by the extremely low poll ratings being generated by the current u s _meta_end_dot_

 congress _meta_end_dot_

 they hear that the public is not happy with the way washington operates but they don t believe they need to do anything about that as if all that unhappiness was somebody else s problem and not their own _meta_end_dot_

 i m not so sure _meta_end_dot_

 i believe the public discontent can be accurately sourced and congressional earmarking process has become a symbol for wasteful and undisciplined federal spending _meta_end_dot_

 earlier this month i joined a bipartisan group calling for a one year moratorium on all earmarks _meta_end_dot_

 that effort failed _meta_end_dot_

 we missed a major opportunity to show we are serious about tightening our congressional belts during a difficult economic period _meta_end_dot_

 read on _meta_end_dot_

 a study by taxpayers for common sense recently noted that congress disclosed _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ earmarks worth _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ billion in this year s spending bills it noted an additional _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ billion worth of earmarks were added with no sponsor identified making a grand total of _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ billion in congressional earmarks this year _meta_end_dot_

 yes that number was reduced slightly from the previous year but many of my constituents are hardly impressed _meta_end_dot_

 as the taxpayers for common sense study states much of the public outcry about earmarks results from concern that earmarks are part of the pay to play culture in washington where taxpayer money is diverted to reward campaign contributors lobbyists and political cronies with pet projects the earmark process is subject to harsh criticism indeed that it s riddled with secrecy corruption and wasteful spending _meta_end_dot_

 while i believe that representatives elected by the people rather than government bureaucrats should have the ability to direct these funds the system we have now is broken and it s not being fixed _meta_end_dot_

 the public s skepticism about earmarking is well documented _meta_end_dot_

 the congress didn t employ an organized earmark process until the _meta_number_ref_s _meta_end_dot_

 by _meta_number_ref_ earmarking was so out of hand that republicans included an earmark cutback in the contract with america _meta_end_dot_

 but after a brief period of fasting republicans began opening the gates again and public confidence in their congress resumed its current downward trend _meta_end_dot_

 since taking over in _meta_number_ref_ democrats have shown no appetite for forgoing pork _meta_end_dot_

 in fact we heard last week that the computer system in a house committee was so overloaded with earmark requests from various members that it broke down under the strain _meta_end_dot_

 we clearly have not learned our lessons _meta_end_dot_

 of course congress has funded a number of worthy projects via earmarks _meta_end_dot_

 limited reforms last year have shed some light on the process forcing lawmakers to affirm they receive no financial gain from their earmarks _meta_end_dot_

 but as one of my colleagues put it the system is not merely a case of a few bad apples in a barrel _meta_end_dot_

 one state getting _meta_dollor_ref_ per capita in earmarks and a dozen others getting _meta_dollor_ref_ a person or less is more political than equitable _meta_end_dot_

 a few states especially those with senior members on appropriations committees are doing very well under the current system _meta_end_dot_

 but most states are being shortchanged _meta_end_dot_

 whenever taxpayer money is sent to washington for bureaucratic handling and then dispersed via a largely opaque process democracy is not being well served _meta_end_dot_

 even a one year moratorium on earmarking was too great a sacrifice for the political class in washington this month _meta_end_dot_

 we could have used that time to regroup and put in place a process for local expenditures that is fair transparent and defensible to the public _meta_end_dot_

 we missed that opportunity and it will not be surprising if the public continues to object to our inaction _meta_end_dot_
