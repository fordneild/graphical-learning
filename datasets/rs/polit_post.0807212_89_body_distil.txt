  another reason we re supporting pete olson in tx _meta_number_ref_ is because he s a serious candidate with a serious background _meta_end_dot_

 shelley sekula gibbs jackie joyner kersey sis boom baa does not like that pete is highlighting her record of saying anything to get elected _meta_end_dot_

 so what does her campaign manager do _meta_end_question_

 he attacks pete olson for serving in the military _meta_end_dot_

 i would submit that one of these two people had a few months in congress and chased off every staffer in her office _meta_end_dot_

 i would also submit that when one has been both pro choice and pro life pro illegal immigrant and anti illegal immigrant pro big government and anti big government and liberal the whole time that person is not the best choice for office _meta_end_dot_

 we continue to support pete olson in texas _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 shelley had her turn and she blew it _meta_end_dot_
