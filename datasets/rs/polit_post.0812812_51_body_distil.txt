  most anyone watching the primaries had expected all along that obama would win north carolina where the democratic primary electorate is dominated by african americans and college towns and hillary would win the more conservative white democrats in indiana last night but hillary s relatively narrow margin of victory in indiana and the simple fact that obama notched a victory in a state of significant size after a string of losses both add up to an undeniably good night for obama _meta_end_dot_

 let s update the chart i ran previously of the popular vote since the beginning of march as you can see over this period covering the time after the genuine cracks in obama s previously untouched public brand image had appeared obama is still behind in the popular vote and with only oregon on may _meta_number_ref_ as a likely source for significant number of votes for obama that s not going to change _meta_end_dot_

 read on _meta_end_dot_

 that s even before you deal with the exit polls i ll leave the dissection of those to others but it seems pretty clear that obama is getting crushed among white and latino voters and you can t win much of anything in these united states without those two groups _meta_end_dot_

 it s also before you deal with the popular vote for january and february which is harder to measure because you get into the question of how to estimate the caucus popular votes in some states these were not recorded or whether to count florida and michigan here s the remaining schedule with a chart showing the most recent poll i could find i used rasmussen for west virginia kentucky and oregon a mid april dakota wesleyan poll for south dakota a mid april puerto rico poll and lacking a head to head poll i used rasmussen s general election numbers for montana which show obama polling much better but with basically similar numbers to the south dakota poll but note that unlike earlier obama mountain state victories these are primaries not caucuses _meta_end_dot_

 i then projected the number of voters for the states i used the number of ballots cast for democrats in the house in _meta_number_ref_ since this seems to have been a fairly reliable proxy for the number of ballots cast in the primaries in pennsylvania indiana and north carolina puerto rico is more challenging but to be conservative i just assumed a turnout of _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ million voters which is roughly _meta_percent_ref_ of the _meta_number_ref_ gubernatorial general election turnout in which above _meta_percent_ref_ of registered voters voted as ben domenech has noted given puerto rico s traditionally high voter turnout and the realization that this may be a unique opportunity to affect the mainland presidential election if hillary s still battling at this point the turnout could be much closer to the general election figures obviously these are very rough estimates especially since some of these polls have upwards of _meta_percent_ref_ of the electorate undecided but you get the general idea _meta_end_dot_

 much will depend on the turnout especially in puerto rico but i think it s a safe bet that when all is said and done obama will be down somewhere in the neighborhood of _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ votes for the period covering the last three months of the primary campaign _meta_end_dot_

 heck of a way to launch a general election campaign _meta_end_dot_

 for the mathematically curious wv _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ or _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ mt _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ i m using fec sources for this except for the puerto rico numbers linked above and rcp for the popular vote chart _meta_end_dot_
