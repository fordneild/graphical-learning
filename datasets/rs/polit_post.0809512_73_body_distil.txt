  you may or may not have noticed treasury secretary paulson s speech last monday in which he unveiled a blueprint for modernizing the federal government s regulation of financial markets _meta_end_dot_

 if you did notice it you probably yawned _meta_end_dot_

 the report has been in the making for over a year and although it contains a lot of good ideas it s neither directly responsive to the current market disorders nor particularly likely to be enacted in whole or in part _meta_end_dot_

 the editorialist at the new york times noticed the speech however _meta_end_dot_

 their predictable response is that paulson s plan is far too reluctant to clamp down on market behavior that can result in stress and crisis _meta_end_dot_

 unfortunately i don t get much sense that the editorial powers at the new york times have direct knowledge of how real markets work _meta_end_dot_

 as it turns out markets are human too _meta_end_dot_

 let me tell you what i mean the times editorial is full of standard issue language that betrays a specific point of view about the nature of financial crises _meta_end_dot_

 here s a sample and another ok _meta_end_dot_

 let s understand specifically and clearly the mindset that underlies these comments _meta_end_dot_

 here s one way to encapsulate that mindset financial markets are like complex machines _meta_end_dot_

 they behave in ways that are understandable by experts _meta_end_dot_

 all you have to do is apply the correct adjustments to them and they won t do bad things _meta_end_dot_

 in this view which is shared by many economists but by few participants in real markets the reason we re in a financial crisis is because creative innovation changed the markets in ways that regulators didn t respond to _meta_end_dot_

 i would say rather that creative innovation has changed markets in ways that no one actually even understands yet much less has any power to regulate effectively _meta_end_dot_

 exhibit a is the shadow banking system a term used by bill gross the chief investment officer of pimco funds a large bond mutual fund operator among others _meta_end_dot_

 what s the shadow _meta_end_question_

 credit derivatives for the most part _meta_end_dot_

 this is the witch s brew of bizarre terminology you ve heard people slinging around for months now credit default swaps collateralized debt obligations structured investment vehicles auction rate bonds _meta_end_dot_

 to avoid a long geeky analysis let me just say that financial engineering has strongly reduced friction in the flow and allocation of global capital _meta_end_dot_

 reducing friction in capital markets is effectively the same as creating more credit _meta_end_dot_

 whenever you create more credit you have to find good efficient uses for it otherwise you get bubbles _meta_end_dot_

 and bubbles burst _meta_end_dot_

 underneath this _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ foot view there is a huge amount of poorly understood detail _meta_end_dot_

 regulating it properly is necessary but it will take years to do it right _meta_end_dot_

 doing it in a hasty and half tailed way so as to capitalize on the current political moment is a recipe for disaster _meta_end_dot_

 the new york times and many other people assume that you can prevent financial crises if you regulate markets the right way _meta_end_dot_

 but this misunderstands market behavior because it misapplies the lessons of human nature _meta_end_dot_

 markets are not like machines _meta_end_dot_

 they re like people _meta_end_dot_

 market participants are motivated alternately by fear and greed _meta_end_dot_

 sometimes fear is stronger than greed _meta_end_dot_

 if you have even the slightest sense that someone you ve made a deal with is or will become unlikely to pay you back in full what s your response _meta_end_question_

 well unless your counterparty is a member of your immediate family your natural response is to pull your money out and either sit on the sidelines or trade with someone else _meta_end_dot_

 in markets as in real life people always take care of their own interests before they take care of someone else s _meta_end_dot_

 i defy anyone reading this to tell me that they would behave any differently _meta_end_dot_

 as soon as one player gets the creeps about someone else news spreads fast and soon everyone does _meta_end_dot_

 this can happen literally overnight as it did to bear stearns _meta_end_dot_

 markets always overreact to stress because people overreact to stress _meta_end_dot_

 the only way to avoid financial crises is not to have financial markets in the first place _meta_end_dot_

 to mitigate crises when they occur is a legitimate and essential policy objective as has been borne out by decades of federal reserve history _meta_end_dot_

 but it s na ve and foolish to suggest as the new york times explicitly does that the correct policy objective should be to prevent crises before they occur _meta_end_dot_
