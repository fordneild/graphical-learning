  the fight continues to protect californians from the abuses of civil liberties authorized by the supreme court in kelo v _meta_end_dot_

 new london _meta_end_dot_

 proponents of our civil rights against theft of property have placed on the june ballot proposition _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 unlike the last proposition _meta_number_ref_ which began our disastrous budget problems by placing hard lower limits on school spending growth this one is from the good guys _meta_end_dot_

 the new proposition _meta_number_ref_ is a proposed state constitutional amendment that would place sweeping restrictions on eminent domain abuse statewide and ensure that just compensation is provided even when the takings occur _meta_end_dot_

 however the forces of big government are not quick to give up _meta_end_dot_

 corrupt city and county governments have in turn put on the ballot proposition _meta_number_ref_ another proposed amendment _meta_end_dot_

 masquerading as an anti eminent domain law proposition _meta_number_ref_ would not even have helped in the kelo case so narrow are the limits on government set _meta_end_dot_

 read on _meta_end_dot_

 updated below the fold as could probably be predicted i support proposition _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 i think it s just the kind of amendment that a state like california needs to pass revolutionizing the way we look at property rights much as proposition _meta_number_ref_ shocked the nation with our controlling of property taxes _meta_end_dot_

 in fact there s a way of looking at proposition _meta_number_ref_ as a successor to proposition _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 so of course big government and big spending types statewide are strongly against it led by the girly man himself governor schwarzenegger _meta_end_dot_

 given a chance to take a stand on for freedom he backs down _meta_end_dot_

 as an aside let this be a reminder that being pro abortion does not make one a libertarian republican _meta_end_dot_

 add enough well funded elements against a ballot measure with a good chance of passing such is the case with proposition _meta_number_ref_ and a particular tactic has grown common get another deceptively similar measure on the ballot muddy the waters and hope for the best _meta_end_dot_

 that s the plan with proposition _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 proposition _meta_number_ref_ limits eminent domain only for a primary residence but adds a laundry list of exceptions to even that narrow limitation _meta_end_dot_

 it lacks any broad recognition of property rights a firm definition of just compensation and for freedom lovers is no substitute for proposition _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 so for my vote i recommend support for proposition _meta_number_ref_ and opposition to proposition _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 strike down big government tell the supreme court who s boss and make california safe to own property again _meta_end_dot_

 update upon looking up the text of proposition _meta_number_ref_ it has come to my attention that the howard jarvis taxpayers association is responsible for the amendment _meta_end_dot_

 the group is of course best known for proposition _meta_number_ref_ meaning _meta_number_ref_ is more of a successor to _meta_number_ref_ than i even imagined when i wrote the above _meta_end_exclamation_
