  folks i apologize for not posting yesterday but it s been one crazy busy week as you can guess _meta_end_dot_

 there has been enough financial and business news to fill up a dozen long posts _meta_end_dot_

 but i wanted to make sure you re all aware of a very important follow on effect from the federal reserve s three quarter point cut in their key short term interest rate _meta_end_dot_

 succinctly that effect is the end of inflation _meta_end_dot_

 read on _meta_end_dot_

 all right i admit that was provocative _meta_end_dot_

 and oversimplified _meta_end_dot_

 i m not talking about the end of actual inflation in commodity prices as experienced by consumers here and in other countries _meta_end_dot_

 i m talking about the end of a market dynamic that has been in place for most of this year so far _meta_end_dot_

 here s the logic chain _meta_number_ref_ the sky is falling _meta_end_exclamation_

 _meta_number_ref_ the falling interest rates will drive the dollar lower and lower _meta_end_exclamation_

 _meta_number_ref_ therefore i m going to buy oil gold grains and metals _meta_end_exclamation_

 but the fed coldly and shrewdly confounded many people s expectations by only cutting rates by _meta_number_ref_ basis points on tuesday _meta_end_dot_

 many people would have been less surprised with _meta_number_ref_ basis points _meta_end_dot_

 the bond market immediately plunged on the news of the smaller than many expected cut _meta_end_dot_

 and a day later prices for gold oil grains and metals also plunged _meta_end_dot_

 they re still falling this morning _meta_end_dot_

 i don t have time to get into an analysis of the commentary that appeared after the fed s rate action on tuesday except to remind everyone that market psychology matters _meta_end_dot_

 if you walk down wall street you ll see a lot of creatures that superficially resemble humans _meta_end_dot_

 don t be fooled _meta_end_dot_

 they re actually wild herd animals _meta_end_dot_

 they look for leadership they assess it primarily in terms of testicle size and they smell fear from miles away _meta_end_dot_

 they liked what they got from the fed _meta_end_dot_

 and there s another critical point _meta_end_dot_

 i ve said in a whole raft of posts over the last several months that the inflation everyone is concerned about is being driven at least as much by speculative activity as by supply demand fundamentals _meta_end_dot_

 i think this week s action proves that case _meta_end_dot_

 i m much less worried about inflation than i am about the effects of the continuing credit crisis which shows few signs of abating _meta_end_dot_
