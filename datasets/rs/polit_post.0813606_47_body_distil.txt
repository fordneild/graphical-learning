  it seems that marc dann finally realized that the gig was up and he couldn t hang on the situation is thick with irony _meta_end_dot_

 dann was one of the loudest critics of former governor bob taft and hammered ohio republicans on the so called culture of corruption theme over and over _meta_end_dot_

 surprised when his tactics worked he found himself elected to a critical statewide office lacking the competence and leadership skills to do the job _meta_end_dot_

 now he finds himself forced to resign after articles of impeachment were filled against him by his own party and his office was searched by the inspector general in the aftermath of revelations that his office was rife with sexual harassment and improper relationships including an affair between dann and his scheduler _meta_end_dot_

 all taft did was play golf with friends and fill out some paperwork wrong _meta_end_exclamation_

 that old adage that you need to be loved or feared is applicable here _meta_end_dot_

 dann s bombastic style and lack of judgment alienated even fellow democrats _meta_end_dot_

 lacking power or friends he soon found himself without a political card to play _meta_end_dot_

 ohio democrats appreciate the fact that they have gained the power they have they control four out of five statewide offices but the gop controls the general assembly thanks to some screw ups by republicans and an appearance of moderation and stability _meta_end_dot_

 there was no way they were going to let someone like marc dann put that at risk _meta_end_dot_

 the netroots might take note that angry attack style politics is not how democrats have found success in critical swing states _meta_end_dot_

 and if the party doesn t find you useful they will kick you to the curb without blinking an eye _meta_end_dot_
