  mitt romney held his first conference call with bloggers yesterday following in the footsteps of rivals john mccain and mike huckabee _meta_end_dot_

 romney s campaign chose to connect the candidate to bloggers at least a select few just as the republican presidential race reaches a critical moment _meta_end_dot_

 the campaign s director of online communications stephen smith organized the call for about a dozen mostly pro romney bloggers friday morning _meta_end_dot_

 but as soon as it was over the buzz among bloggers was not what romney said but who got left off the invite list _meta_end_dot_

 i was among the unlucky ones who didn t make the cut _meta_end_dot_

 i d be lying if i didn t acknowledge my disappointment _meta_end_dot_

 it s not that i had a craving to talk to romney i got to do my own one on one interview about a year ago _meta_end_dot_

 but i d never been deliberately excluded from one of these calls _meta_end_dot_

 apparently i wasn t the only one who was miffed _meta_end_dot_

 matt lewis of townhall told me that he wrote to smith and press secretary kevin madden questioning the campaign s decision _meta_end_dot_

 jon fleischman of the flash report had just interviewed romney a day earlier and couldn t believe he was left off the call _meta_end_dot_

 i think this must be a case of the left foot and the right foot not talking fleischman said _meta_end_dot_

 when running for president you have to avoid missteps like this especially this late in the game continued on the jump _meta_end_dot_

 and jennifer rubin of commentary who reports daily about the presidential race thought romney s outreach to bloggers stood out in stark contrast to mccain s operation _meta_end_dot_

 mccain holds calls every other week invites a variety of bloggers some of whom openly disagree with the candidate and usually takes every last question _meta_end_dot_

 it seems apparent that mccain s team has a far more sophisticated and more inclusive new media operation rubin told me _meta_end_dot_

 the frequency of the mccain calls the length the calls the opportunity for substantive follow up questions and the number of invitees dwarfs anything the other campaigns have done _meta_end_dot_

 perhaps it has something to do with the results mccain is achieving in fairness to the romney campaign i asked smith to explain the campaign s rationale for limiting the number of participants on the call _meta_end_dot_

 the selection process was more art than science smith said but we considered factors such as the size of the blogger s readership the geographic location of that readership and the amount of influence that each blogger has within new media generally or within more particular audiences former supporters of mayor giuliani or senator thompson for example the result was _meta_number_ref_ bloggers who called in to chat with romney reid wilson of real clear politics ed morrissey of captain s quarters patrick ruffini and amanda carpenter of townhall phil klein and james antle of the american spectator dean barnett of the weekly standard paul mirengoff of power line jim geraghty of the campaign spot michael illions of polipundit john hawkins of right wing news jim hoft of gateway pundit bryan preston of hot air and dan riehl of riehl world view _meta_end_dot_

 smith told me more bloggers were invited but some couldn t participate _meta_end_dot_

 of those who did it should be noted that most have either endorsed romney or are publicly working against mccain _meta_end_dot_

 romney s outreach strategy appears to be somewhat similar to the approach of huckabee s blogger calls _meta_end_dot_

 the last time i attended one i was the only blogger who wasn t backing huckabee _meta_end_dot_

 here s how soren dayton described the huckabee calls every question except mine started with an expression of support or love _meta_end_dot_

 this is not how it works for rudy giuliani or john mccain _meta_end_dot_

 the people on those calls are high traffic national blogs focused on politics _meta_end_dot_

 the people on the huckabee call were at least local blogs often focused on things other than politics romney s campaign was apparently trying to find something in the middle high traffic blogs favorable to romney _meta_end_dot_

 apparently it worked _meta_end_dot_

 smith told me the invited bloggers asked meaningful questions and gave fair reports of the call kudos to romney for finally doing a call with bloggers _meta_end_dot_

 it s just too bad the campaign limited its impact by selecting such a small group of participants _meta_end_dot_
