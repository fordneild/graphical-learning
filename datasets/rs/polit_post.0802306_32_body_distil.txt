  sadly fred thompson has pulled the plug on his campaign _meta_end_dot_

 one could see it coming but his supporters and yes i proudly was one of them feel a sense of loss _meta_end_dot_

 thompson was the only candidate in the gop race who consistently advocated a small government free market federalist message and his departure leaves a hole in the race for the gop nomination _meta_end_dot_

 neither one of his competitors articulated the message of reaganism as closely and as eloquently as thompson did _meta_end_dot_

 i suppose that there are things to learn from this episode in american presidential history _meta_end_dot_

 we learn that getting in the race for the presidency early is now an imperative _meta_end_dot_

 we learn that untraditional campaigns fail _meta_end_dot_

 and we learn that however much a candidate is ambitious for his ideas it won t matter to the electorate unless he is also ambitious for himself or herself _meta_end_dot_

 this appears to be the reality of the day and it is to that reality that we supporters of fred thompson have to reconcile ourselves _meta_end_dot_

 but we don t have to like it _meta_end_dot_

 we may tut tut at thompson s disregard for presidential electioneering conventional wisdom _meta_end_dot_

 and we may be right to do so as well _meta_end_dot_

 but i don t believe that fred thompson departed from that conventional wisdom merely because he was lazy lazy people don t get to where he has gotten in life _meta_end_dot_

 i think that he saw a better way to elect presidents and his way was not shared by the electorate _meta_end_dot_
