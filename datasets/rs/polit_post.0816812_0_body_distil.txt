  i see that keith olbermann is not a favorite of some people on the other side of the partisan divide _meta_end_dot_

 of course when olbermann goes ballistic on republicans that s fine and good _meta_end_dot_

 it s just when he goes ballistic on hillary clinton that there is a problem _meta_end_dot_

 perhaps the moral of this story is not to cast your lot with someone who has a history of being exceedingly temperamental in the first place _meta_end_dot_

 it may be fun when the fire and brimstone are directed towards others however unfair those attacks may be but when it comes to dealing with people like keith olbermann eventually even his allies get singed _meta_end_dot_

 people at nbc must really miss tim russert _meta_end_dot_

 he would always provide interesting and dispassionate analysis in addition to evincing a pure and undiluted love for the political process _meta_end_dot_

 now they are stuck with the likes of olbermann and chris matthews blowhards who substitute rage and fury for intellect and reason _meta_end_dot_

 i can t believe that the effect on the quality of nbc s political coverage will be anything less than utterly disastrous _meta_end_dot_

 as for olbermann s onetime allies who now feel betrayed by him well they deserve what they get _meta_end_dot_
