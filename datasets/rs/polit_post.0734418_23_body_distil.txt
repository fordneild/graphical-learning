  i realize this story about huckabee in utah is supposed to turn my stomach against him but i find it oddly compelling me toward liking the guy even more even more from a small government perspective _meta_end_dot_

 it seems clear huckabee recognizes that government is a problem not a solution _meta_end_dot_

 it s clear he recognizes that government is an unyielding leviathan _meta_end_dot_

 i don t have a problem with that at all _meta_end_dot_

 if i keep seeing hit jobs like this and the aids quote against huckabee i might take a real liking to the guy _meta_end_dot_
