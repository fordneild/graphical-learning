  after losing the debate tonight obama gave hillary the finger today _meta_end_dot_

 i don t know if he intended to do that hand gesture in his pause while talking about hillary but it is obvious the crowd thought it was an intentional raising of the middle finger _meta_end_dot_

 see for yourself updated the baltimore sun was at a different angle _meta_end_dot_

 definitely one finger _meta_end_dot_

 definitely the crowd knew what he was doing _meta_end_dot_

 additional the los angeles times points it out too _meta_end_dot_

 ben smith might want to look at the different angle before eagerly myth busting _meta_end_dot_
