 i have several quick updates _meta_end_dot_

 first matt lewis notes that it is odd that bitter gate was a_meta_number_ref_ and a week long story that will be a dominant theme of the campaign _meta_end_dot_

 second i noted that the stories seemed old _meta_end_dot_

 well jake tapper notes that he first broke the story in the lede in _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 third the corner reports salter s criticism of the report _meta_end_dot_

 but the tastiest is that michael leahy and his editors didn t actually fact check the story _meta_end_dot_
