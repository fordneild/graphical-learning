  a democratic louisiana state representative carla blanchard dartez la _meta_number_ref_ called a civil rights leader buckwheat the naacp is upset with this unsavory reminder of southern democrats and their past _meta_end_dot_

 but more importantly i feel it is necessary to give credit where it is due _meta_end_dot_

 the ap article identifies dartez as a democrat immediately _meta_end_dot_

 this is notable because generally reuters and ap mention party in bad articles about republicans but put it at the end or not in the article at all when bad articles are about democrats _meta_end_dot_

 so kudos to the ap for moving toward non partisanship _meta_end_dot_

 more important to the politics of louisiana rep _meta_end_dot_

 dartez is in a runoff against a republican on november _meta_number_ref_th _meta_end_dot_

 in the jungle primary dartez led _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ with other ds splitting the other _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 thus the runoff was likely going to be a dartez victory _meta_end_dot_

 this incident could swing the election in macaca fashion _meta_end_dot_

 and it is a reminder why contesting all elections is important _meta_end_dot_
