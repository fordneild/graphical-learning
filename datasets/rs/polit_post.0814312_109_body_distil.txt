  news is breaking that john mccain is meeting with bobby jindal charlie crist and mitt romney this memorial day weekend _meta_end_dot_

 the media is missing another name that i know of _meta_end_dot_

 likewise for those still following the huckabee veepstakes rumor mill a whisper in my ear tells me he has taken himself out of the running after a visit by a mccain emissary to arkansas last week _meta_end_dot_

 let me just be blunt with the mccain folks _meta_end_dot_

 the name that the media is not listing is wholly unacceptable and i really can t think mccain would seriously consider him _meta_end_dot_

 i realize he s a friend and all but seriously no hell no _meta_end_dot_

 and i actually suspect he s just tagging along like he has throughout the campaign _meta_end_dot_

 but not him senator go with lieberman or ron paul before you go with him _meta_end_dot_

 now to the list as presented by the media bobby jindal i expect he ll say no but you can ask _meta_end_dot_

 louisiana needs him and he needs more time in office _meta_end_dot_

 but good choice _meta_end_dot_

 mitt romney absolutely but he really doesn t get you as much as a few others could _meta_end_dot_

 but he d be great _meta_end_dot_

 charlie crist are you kidding me _meta_end_question_

 seriously _meta_end_question_

 let me be blunt yet again i will bolt so fast from supporting you if you pick this well tanned squish and all his baggage _meta_end_dot_

 charlie crist is totally and completely unacceptable _meta_end_dot_

 that s not even negotiable _meta_end_dot_

 i do not think i could say anything positive at all about the gop ticket if that guy were on it _meta_end_dot_

 go with ron paul or mike huckabee but do not go with charlie crist _meta_end_dot_

 senator your problem is with conservatives not with squishy moderates _meta_end_dot_

 actually i think huckabee would be a good pick for you but that s another blog post i realize mccain needs face time with these guys _meta_end_dot_

 my understanding is that this is one of several meetings like this _meta_end_dot_

 and i suspect this is the thanks but no thanks meeting _meta_end_dot_

 as far as crist is concerned it sure as hell better be _meta_end_dot_

 honestly and this is where you guys decide i m crazy but i m convinced i m crazy like a fox have i got a veep pick for you senator mccain _meta_end_dot_

 seriously _meta_end_dot_
