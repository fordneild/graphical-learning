  several very important things happened in the market for mortgage backed securities mbs this past week _meta_end_dot_

 they re technically arcane and hard to reduce to sound bites so they didn t make a big ripple in the news _meta_end_dot_

 but the effects will be far reaching _meta_end_dot_

 many published reports here s one at midweek had it that ubs the union bank of switzerland had dumped a _meta_dollor_ref_ billion portfolio of securities backed by alt a mortgages which are intermediate in quality between prime and subprime _meta_end_dot_

 according to the whispers ubs received _meta_number_ref_ cents on the dollar for the position _meta_end_dot_

 the rumored buyer is interesting too _meta_end_dot_

 more on that in a moment you know what happens when the guy down the block sells his house _meta_end_dot_

 the price he gets becomes a comparable transaction that affects the perceived market value of your own house _meta_end_dot_

 same thing happens with illiquid securities like mbs _meta_end_dot_

 read on _meta_end_dot_

 the market for securities backed by mortgages other than subprime mortgages had been reasonably orderly until this week _meta_end_dot_

 ubs changed the dynamic by choosing to abruptly exit _meta_end_dot_

 but in an effect that you may find strange their action suddenly reduced the valuation of similar securities in portfolios around the world _meta_end_dot_

 when they do their accounting institutions nowadays are required to mark their financial assets to market this derives from a risk management methodology called var or value at risk _meta_end_dot_

 since there is no secondary market for most mbs securities there are no market prices you can use to report the value of your holdings on any given day _meta_end_dot_

 so for many of these securities comparable transactions become the valuation reference _meta_end_dot_

 thus the move by ubs had several effects _meta_end_dot_

 for banks it means that regulators may force many of them to re classify large chunks of their portfolios into a lower tier of the var liquidity model which could endanger their credit ratings _meta_end_dot_

 for hedge funds and wall street firms that buy securities with leverage borrowed money it means they will face margin calls _meta_end_dot_

 and they will be forced to either come up with more cash to hold their positions which most of them won t be able to do or start holding their own fire sales in an already down market _meta_end_dot_

 and in fact two institutions thornburg mortgage inc _meta_end_dot_

 of new mexico and a mortgage bond fund run by carlyle group of washington dc immediately got hit with large margin calls that threaten their survival _meta_end_dot_

 there will be more _meta_end_dot_

 the bottom line is that a great many financial institutions have begun a process of de leveraging that will cause them to shun much of the ordinary commercial and retail lending that makes the economy work _meta_end_dot_

 you re already seeing this in the market for home mortgages _meta_end_dot_

 one would have thought that massive interest rate cuts by the federal reserve would result in lower mortgage rates _meta_end_dot_

 instead mortgage rates have gone up in recent weeks _meta_end_dot_

 part of this is because the _meta_number_ref_ year treasury note has fallen in value compared to a month or two ago _meta_end_dot_

 but much of it can be seen in the interest rate spread between _meta_number_ref_ year securities issued by fannie mae and the _meta_number_ref_ year treasury note _meta_end_dot_

 fannie s bonds are yielding over two percentage points more than the _meta_number_ref_ year t which is used to hedge them _meta_end_dot_

 that s the biggest spread in over twenty years _meta_end_dot_

 and it suggests that banks have suddenly become much more reluctant to lend money to homeowners _meta_end_dot_

 that s going to make houses harder for people to buy even at a time when the market value of houses is falling _meta_end_dot_

 and it will further exacerbate the negative wealth effect that is believed to be putting pressure on consumer spending _meta_end_dot_

 so people are off the mark when they tell you that the federal reserve is to blame for the mortgage crisis _meta_end_dot_

 it turns out that the interest rate policy lever may be powerless to induce banks to start lending again _meta_end_dot_

 now it s absolutely positively unequivocally true that the massive markdown in the value of mortgage backed securities is being way overdone _meta_end_dot_

 many perhaps most of the current transactions are taking place far below the long term stable value of the securities _meta_end_dot_

 and who benefits from that _meta_end_question_

 well i ve long suspected that people like bill gross warren buffett and alan greenspan who works for gross these days were talking out of both sides of their mouths when they ve loudly called for non intervention in the mbs market _meta_end_dot_

 turns out that the rumored buyer of the _meta_number_ref_ million swiss franc ubs portfolio this week was pimco funds the california based bond mutual fund owned by german insurer allianz _meta_end_dot_

 pimco is run by none other than bill gross _meta_end_dot_

 the effect of panics in financial markets is always to move assets from weak hands to strong hands _meta_end_dot_

 this is how the world works there s nothing wrong with it and the end result years from now will be a stronger financial system _meta_end_dot_

 the problem is that this perfect storm is having massive disruptive effects in ordinary people s lives _meta_end_dot_

 over long periods of time credit unavailability retards economic growth and causes recessions _meta_end_dot_

 and that has major spillover effects on our politics _meta_end_dot_

 after the presidential election there will be a huge push to overhaul the regulation of the banking and financial industries to introduce greater transparency no one ever wants to again be in the position of having to ask why the hell didn t you all see this coming_meta_beep_ref_ the financial world will be totally reshaped next year by people like house banking committee chairman barney frank ways and means chairman charlie rangel and the treasury secretary named by whoever becomes president _meta_end_dot_

 and the uncertainty surrounding this is itself a reason for banks to avoid making any new loans _meta_end_dot_

 finally much of the discussion has been about asking who screwed up i suppose the thinking is that if you can find someone to blame for causing the mess you can hang him from a tree and everyone else can move on _meta_end_dot_

 but like a metastasizing cancer or a garbage fire next to an oil refinery you can t solve this problem by disciplining the people who caused it _meta_end_dot_

 it s way too big for that now _meta_end_dot_
