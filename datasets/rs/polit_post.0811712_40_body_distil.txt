  john mccain held another blogger conference call friday morning which moe lane california yankee and i were glad to participate in _meta_end_dot_

 overall it went well _meta_end_dot_

 the bloggers took mccain to task over the nc gop ad and mccain took obama to task over ayers and hamas _meta_end_dot_

 a number of well known bloggers had the opportunity to ask questions including hugh hewitt michael goldfarb jim geraghty amanda carpenter sean hackbarth ed morrissey jennifer rubin and more _meta_end_dot_

 this will be a summary of a few of the major moments from the call _meta_end_dot_

 if they want their taxes raised and they think that s best for the american future then i m not their guy senator mccain began with an opening statement in which he touched on poverty post katrina louisiana energy independence and his stance on the economy among other things _meta_end_dot_

 spending is the problem in washington he said not the lack of revenues _meta_end_dot_

 here is the audio of the opening remarks i m offended at a comparison to a man like tom coburn the first question was from hugh hewitt _meta_end_dot_

 hugh pointed out that since mccain s last comments regarding obama and ayers new audio and video of both ayers and dohrn have surfaced _meta_end_dot_

 what obligation does senator obama have to talk about his associations with former and current radicals and what obligations does the media have to ask him about those hugh asked _meta_end_dot_

 senator mccain first blasted obama once more for comparing ayers and senator tom coburn _meta_end_dot_

 he said that he thought senator obama should apologize to the american people for having anything to do with an unrepentant terrorist _meta_end_dot_

 in my view he said this organization was a terrorist organization by any description and i think that americans should be discussing it and the media _meta_end_dot_

 here is hugh s blog on the topic _meta_end_dot_

 this is the audio for hugh s question and senator mccain s answer i want the best kind of campaign michael goldfarb asked what the problem was with the nc gop ad and why senator mccain wants it pulled _meta_end_dot_

 the question was followed up on by jim geraghty who wanted to know if voters ought to take wright into account _meta_end_dot_

 in my view we should be talking about the differences between senator obama and myself was the overall theme of his response _meta_end_dot_

 he made clear he was expressing his own point of view which he felt he was entitled to share and that he couldn t control what the nc gop does with the ad _meta_end_dot_

 it was clear that senator mccain wants the party to have what he views as a clean campaign _meta_end_dot_

 i d be very surprised to see reverend wright ads run in the general campaign at the national level _meta_end_dot_

 there is a sense in which we bloggers and grassroots types are talking past the senator and vice versa _meta_end_dot_

 his entire discussion of the ad was in the context of the national campaign _meta_end_dot_

 it s not the kind of campaign he wants to run that he wants to focus on the difference between his positions and those of senator obama _meta_end_dot_

 the ad in question however is a state ad _meta_end_dot_

 they aren t focused on the differences between senator mccain and senator obama because neither is the subject of the ad _meta_end_dot_

 the ad is about judgement lack of which on the d side is best exemplified by those who endorse obama and by obama s twenty year endorsement of reverend wright _meta_end_dot_

 the ad rightly calls the dems in my home state to task for their poor judgement _meta_end_dot_

 however senator mccain is entitled to his objection and should be able to characterize the style of his campaign _meta_end_dot_

 that he doesn t want to focus advertising on the wright obama character question is not a repudiation of the issue as valid or our concerns as legitimate _meta_end_dot_

 calling the nc gop out of touch with reality is but not wanting to run the ads is not _meta_end_dot_

 running ads on wright would be right and fair _meta_end_dot_

 but it doesn t mean not running them will be disastrous for the mccain campaign _meta_end_dot_

 i also don t see it as an attack on conservatives as some have suggested _meta_end_dot_

 it s john mccain he shares his opinions _meta_end_dot_

 call for tolerance and respect as far as the conference call i d call the issue still open _meta_end_dot_

 here is michael goldfarb s blog on the call and here is jim geraghty s _meta_end_dot_

 this is the audio of both goldfarb and geraghty i will be hamas worst nightmare another big moment was when jennifer rubin brought up hamas jimmy carter and senator obama s unhelpful signals to hamas _meta_end_dot_

 the mac was on the attack here and didn t mince words _meta_end_dot_

 i think it s very clear that it s understandable why they would not want me to be president of the united states _meta_end_dot_

 so if senator obama is favored by hamas i think people can make judgements accordingly yes indeed _meta_end_dot_

 here is jennifer rubin s blog on the topic _meta_end_dot_

 this the audio i just don t think you could do that lastly some hick from north carolina asked redstate s question for senator mccain _meta_end_dot_

 as you know senator obama withdrew from any plans to have a debate in north carolina prior to the primaries _meta_end_dot_

 as a resident i d be interested in your thoughts on setting up some kind of televised discussion between you and senator clinton on issues relevant to north carolinians maybe before the primary he doesn t think you can do that not before they choose their candidate _meta_end_dot_

 i just don t think it would be the appropriate thing to do he said _meta_end_dot_

 thus ends our attempt to recruit senator mccain into operation chaos _meta_end_dot_

 moe lane a twerp from maryland by way of new jersey later emailed the campaign with a follow up asking if the senator would meet with both his opponents for a north carolina primary debate _meta_end_dot_

 the reply sen _meta_end_dot_

 mccain is willing to debate the democratic nominee as many times as possible and in whatever venue is available _meta_end_dot_

 however the democrats should sort out their mess first _meta_end_dot_

 hard to argue with that frankly they really should throughout the call i think it was clear who the senator expects to be the nominee _meta_end_dot_

 i haven t pored over the audio but i can t remember any specific mention of senator clinton other than my own _meta_end_dot_

 he took several opportunities to draw a distinction between himself and senator obama _meta_end_dot_
