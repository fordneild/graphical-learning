  us senator john cornyn representing the greatest state in the nation has a news release posted at his official senate website that is a must read for anyone that thinks this cap and trade nonsense is well nonsense _meta_end_dot_

 titled climate debate must be mindful of unintended consequences the good senator from texas shows that he at least gets it regarding the problem s with the democrat majority s master plan to destroy the economy err i mean save the planet i have been ranting and i have been raving for two days about democrats preferring comprehensive global climate protection to the tune of trillions of dollars over chipping away conservatively one piece of this at a time _meta_end_dot_

 i m fine with giving the planet a couple aspirins over the next _meta_number_ref_ years to break her fever but i am not ok with congress ruining our lives now so they can prop us back up later with bloated government and wealth redistribution and tax breaks for the poor and middle class by giving us tax initiatives to protect us on the senate floor cornyn continues trying to get these crazy democrats to understand what s at stake and who the real problem is props to cornyn for the rube goldberg comment _meta_end_dot_

 he gets it why is this so hard for the democrats _meta_end_question_

 more below the fold _meta_end_dot_

 the thomas library of congress text of the bill can be found here _meta_end_dot_

 the final version as filed can be found here my little gift to you all _meta_end_dot_

 i suggest a read of this pdf file specifically looking at sec _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ around page _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 if you don t have the stomach for it i offer a key passage first of all senses of the senate are non binding which means they wouldn t even have to pay us back what they stole from us _meta_end_dot_

 worse they get to define greatest need _meta_end_dot_

 how do you think that will play out for us _meta_end_question_

 of course democrats keep screaming that this little sense of the senate is going to gin up _meta_number_ref_ trillion dollars to offset huge increases in costs they don t deny will result from this bill knowing full well they don t really mean to give it back to us anyway yeah no trust here at all _meta_end_dot_

 it s worth mentioning before we go much further that this bill has a lot of dirty little secrets most folks would never discover unless they actually trudged through the detailed text of this disaster and trust me it s a disaster _meta_end_dot_

 one of my favorite ponzy schemes is the creation of a climate security act administrative fund aka climate change credit corporation in the treasury _meta_end_dot_

 guess what _meta_end_question_

 it s going to be a brandy new government run bank that will receive all the funds from auctions and tax revenues piled on to carbon bloated bad boys and under the statutes of this bill will be responsible for receiving and redistributing these funds _meta_end_dot_

 no new government bloat there huh _meta_end_question_

 my head s exploding _meta_end_dot_

 the bill will create a lot of other little goodies too _meta_end_dot_

 there will need to be tracking of emissions research capping of emissions and the always popular enforcement that comes with that new inspectors new offices new secretaries and administrators and field investigators _meta_end_dot_

 there will be allowances and offsets and auctions proceeds of which go to our bonny new bank account in the treasury and a really kewl new technology board _meta_end_dot_

 see lower energy costs anywhere in here yet _meta_end_question_

 nope nada _meta_end_dot_

 of course there will be another new board charged with preventing economic hardship that will focus on wait for it banking borrowing emergency off ramps board decided times when someone gets a pass because it would cost them too much to contain their filthy little carbon messes transition assistance for just about everyone in the country and of course green training feel better now _meta_end_question_

 it s much worse these are just a select few examples _meta_end_dot_

 what matters now is the idea that congress has lost its way _meta_end_dot_

 it has big pie in the sky ideas of what new really cool stuff they could do if only they could take more of our money for their neat little projects _meta_end_dot_

 cornyn and some of his friends in the senate see this for what it is a money grab _meta_end_dot_

 and he sees this as not only a horrible idea but one that s poorly timed given our current situation _meta_end_dot_

 this degree of comprehensiveness has a place and time perhaps but this is surely not it _meta_end_dot_

 cornyn is running for re election by the way _meta_end_dot_

 what do you think his opponent has to say about energy prices and the way to address them _meta_end_question_

 blah blah blah real solutions sounds an awful lot like hope and change and change and hope attaboy rick stick it to us in the short term and maybe give some of it back to us later if we go through enough hoops to prove we re poor enough to justify getting it back you d fit right in with the pirates err i mean democrats on the hill but there s already far too many of your ilk up there boy howdy do we not need one more to add to the mess the democrats have made and keep trying to make of this country _meta_end_dot_

 this is really really sad both in its naivete and its bold display of a lack of comprehension _meta_end_dot_

 anyone that thinks this bill boosts the economy and provides immediate tax relief to consumers struggling with high gas prices has no business being in elective office and i m not alone in my thinking we really can t afford ultra liberal policies right now can we _meta_end_question_
