  constant readers may have noticed a quote i had in my comment signature here at red state i m pleased to say that between red state _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ s approaching launch and the current availability of the action alerts it truly is time to get to work _meta_end_dot_

 read on for the why and how _meta_end_dot_

 it s no secret that a great many red state readers are unhappy with the state of the party today _meta_end_dot_

 we ve even had gop war posts on the front page _meta_end_dot_

 but while such rushed mass national action is useful for heading off particular mistakes the party may make it does nothing to prevent future mistakes from being made _meta_end_dot_

 that is why we need to shape the party from the ground up _meta_end_dot_

 join the action alert system and we can notify you about conservative and republican activist opportunities in your community _meta_end_dot_

 we can make this work well if enough people join to make the list potent enough though so please consider joining _meta_end_dot_

 thank you _meta_end_dot_
