  it s fascinating to watch really not as any sort of legal professional the part of doma that allows states not to recognize other state s ssms is bad law _meta_end_dot_

 and a damned good idea because if it ever gets overthrown by the courts it won t be repealed and i don t care what nonsense senator obama uttered about how he ll go about doing that we will see a constitutional amendment pass congress with unseemly haste coupled by a quick ratification by enough states within _meta_number_ref_ years tops _meta_end_dot_

 and the hypothetical president obama will not be able to do anything official about it because the constitution is set up explicitly to prevent the executive branch from being formally involved in constitutional amendments _meta_end_dot_

 for reasons that should be blindingly obvious to anyone who s bothered to think about the subject for thirty uninterrupted seconds _meta_end_dot_

 we will now pause for the hardshell progressives to catch up _meta_end_dot_

 pause excellent _meta_end_dot_

 as hot air noted it s fun to watch bill clinton defend federalism particularly to a student journalist but this is turning into the weirdest election campaign on record _meta_end_dot_

 seeing a democrat defend federalism which is one of their code words for state s rights which itself is one of their code words for i feel like calling a republican a racist will do that to a person _meta_end_dot_

 so will hearing one of them actually say as allahpundit notes so you don t care what the practical implications are although that may just be because bill clinton looks and acts pretty tired right now _meta_end_dot_

 then again they probably all are at this point it s a long season and it s just going to get longer _meta_end_dot_

 stagger those vacations in shifts democrats _meta_end_dot_

 you ve got at least two more months of the grind to go and this is the slack time _meta_end_dot_

 well for you _meta_end_dot_

 we re recharging ourselves _meta_end_dot_
