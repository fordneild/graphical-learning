  is there a better example of a modern ambulance chaser writ large than former veep and nobel prize winner albert gore _meta_end_question_

 it s quite a testament to the man s less than obvious flair for the dramatic and hyperbolic that he has been able to far surpass the cottage industry stage and create an actual worldwide movement out of his alarmist unprovable warnings and admonitions about the invisible silent threat that is manbearpig anthropogenic global warming agw _meta_end_dot_

 it s so easy too _meta_end_dot_

 all gore has to do is wait for any day that feels a little warm or a little cool or a day when the sun shines or is obscured by clouds or when there is hail or sleet and say that it was caused by his personal bugaboo agw _meta_end_dot_

 his real money is made though when a storm comes _meta_end_dot_

 that s right a storm just like earth has had for oh the entirety of its existence _meta_end_dot_

 remember thunderstorms tornadoes cyclones _meta_end_question_

 thought so because they happened when you were growing up just like they did when your parents were growing up just like they did in the days before the internal combustion engine called the greatest threat facing our planet by gore in his _meta_number_ref_ book earth in the balance _meta_end_dot_

 read on _meta_end_dot_

 al gore is in the catbird seat and it s a brilliant place to be as long as one is either completely nuts or okay with having every bit of their popularity built on dishonesty _meta_end_dot_

 all he has to do is wait for a natural event the likes of which has taken place with regularity since the world s beginning and which therefore has a _meta_percent_ref_ chance of occurrence and when it happens dash to the site or to the nearest microphone to claim that the event s occurrence further proves not only the existence but the increasingly dire threat that manbearpig global warming presents to the world as a whole _meta_end_dot_

 seriously how much more plum a position can a person be in _meta_end_question_

 take the absolutely horrific tragedy in myanmar with a storm which has left at least _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ dead and fears of up to _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ casualties persist _meta_end_dot_

 people are still dying the casualty count is still on the rise and here comes al gore strolling up to the microphone to inject himself into yet another tragedy _meta_end_dot_

 we re seeing consequences that scientists have long predicted might be associated with continued global warming he told npr today plugging his one man worldwide multi billion dollar ambulance chasing empire and putting more money in his pockets on the backs of those whose lives have been lost in this natural disaster _meta_end_dot_

 a parasite is the easiest thing in the world to be _meta_end_dot_

 it requires no effort in gore s case all he has to do is sit on a corner which has a _meta_percent_ref_ chance of ambulance passage and wait and when one goes by he just jogs down the street after it shouting i told you so while adoring press and politically correct governments the world over shove microphones in his face and fight over the opportunity to kiss the hem of his cloak _meta_end_dot_

 like i said it s an absolute plum position to be in once you learn to tolerate the gentle self loathing that every person who builds their kingdom on others suffering must deal with and once you get past the indignity of knowing that your entire basis for respect and legitimacy is built on opportunistic falsehoods _meta_end_dot_

 once you can get past those though it s a great place to be _meta_end_dot_

 just ask al gore _meta_end_dot_
