  the obama campaign and lefties everywhere are still pushing the story that john mccain said he wanted to keep fighting in iraq for _meta_number_ref_ years or _meta_number_ref_ years or _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ years _meta_end_dot_

 despite the fact that major nonpartisan organizations are saying that is a total distortion of the record the lefties and a bunch of journalists are keeping on _meta_end_dot_

 what mccain actually said is well hear him in his own words responding to a question about keeping americans in iraq for _meta_number_ref_ or _meta_number_ref_ years contrast that with what barack obama is accusing mccain of which is that mccain would be in favor of _meta_number_ref_ more years of war _meta_end_dot_

 it shows an utter lack of military knowledge on the part of the democrats that they would equate a standing military presence in a country with war _meta_end_dot_

 if we follow their logic we must still be at war in japan and germany and korea _meta_end_dot_

 heck we must still be at war with the confederacy given all the standing armies in the south _meta_end_dot_
