  while we re all focused on the election there s still a lame duck in office who gets one last state of the union address _meta_end_dot_

 it happens tonight _meta_end_dot_

 and the politico reports he s going to say something nice about nancy pelosi _meta_end_dot_

 more interesting though i hear that conservative members of congress are intending to give a republican response to the state of the union _meta_end_dot_

 good for them _meta_end_dot_

 they need to _meta_end_dot_

 i suspect like most of the last few sotu speeches this one is going to be a laundry list of big government initiatives and plaintive appeals to the ownership society without actually doing anything to really move us toward a non government owned society _meta_end_dot_

 but then i ve become cynical _meta_end_dot_

 we ll see tonight _meta_end_dot_
