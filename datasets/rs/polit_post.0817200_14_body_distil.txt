  michael barone notes an nro piece about barack obama s shifting position on iraq now obama shifting his positions around is nothing new _meta_end_dot_

 today it was public funding _meta_end_dot_

 earlier in the week he was slippery about iraq _meta_end_dot_

 a couple of weeks ago he slips and slides around on jerusalem _meta_end_dot_

 but barone continues with a hard allegation via belmont club blogger richard fernandez writing at pajamas media barone says that the question is worth the attention of investigative journalists i concur _meta_end_dot_

 earlier this week obama s campaign defended his misstep on jerusalem on the grounds that he just wasn t that familiar with the debate _meta_end_dot_

 could it be that obama s well connected political mentor and long time trusted friend shared his perspective on the issue _meta_end_dot_

 and obama found rezko s insights compelling _meta_end_question_

 after all syrian born rezko had many friends in the region like nadhmi auchi who obama does not remember meeting even though _meta_number_ref_ witnesses place him at a dinner in auchi s honor _meta_end_dot_

 sounds like a serious question _meta_end_dot_

 someone should ask it _meta_end_dot_
