  first the state analysis ia the rcp graph shows huckabee coming down from his plateau and a two man race in ia _meta_end_dot_

 mccain looks to have surged into third in recent polls and even second place behind romney in an arg poll _meta_end_dot_

 it is doubtful that mccain will come in _meta_number_ref_rd in a state where he isn t really campaigning but that would functionally knock out thompson _meta_end_dot_

 nh the rcp graph for nh shows the overall movement _meta_end_dot_

 more specific poll analysis on nh is below the fold _meta_end_dot_

 mi for some reason rcp doesn t graph mi despite it being the third major vote this primary season _meta_end_dot_

 nonetheless the trends are pretty clear _meta_end_dot_

 rudy has fallen noticeably and must be relying on fl and super tuesday now that he isn t competitive in ia nh or mi _meta_end_dot_

 huck s surge has slowed and romney and huck are fighting for the top spot _meta_end_dot_

 the question will be how much mi responds to the first two states _meta_end_dot_

 will the ia winner of the huck romney battle get a boost in ia _meta_end_question_

 if romney takes nh will it translate to mi _meta_end_question_

 what if mccain gets the upset in nh will he be able to jump in mi enough to win the states back to back _meta_end_question_

 sc the rcp graph for sc shows rudy and thompson nosediving while mccain has trended upwards _meta_end_dot_

 huck and romney still lead _meta_end_dot_

 but the margins in sc and the fact that it comes after ia nh and mi mean that there could be a big shift in the order of the candidates depending on the _meta_number_ref_ earlier states _meta_end_dot_

 national the rcp graph of national polls show the rudy plunge is not just in the early states _meta_end_dot_

 huckabee seems to have plateaued around _meta_percent_ref_ and is fading a little but still solidly in second _meta_end_dot_

 mccain has jumped up mainly due to a fox news poll to a third place tie with romney _meta_end_dot_

 overall analysis below nh polls usa today lvs romney _meta_number_ref_ giuliani _meta_number_ref_ paul _meta_number_ref_ rasmussen lvs romney _meta_number_ref_ giuliani _meta_number_ref_ paul _meta_number_ref_ arg lvs romney _meta_number_ref_ giuliani _meta_number_ref_ paul _meta_number_ref_ candidate analysis the rudy fall is across most states and includes the early states _meta_end_dot_

 rudy s hope to win one of the early states off his reputation alone seems likely to fail _meta_end_dot_

 he will first be competitive in florida after _meta_number_ref_ other winners have been crowned _meta_end_dot_

 huckabee s rise has stopped but he is still competitive in ia mi sc and fl _meta_end_dot_

 he is still the most likely winner in ia and that momentum may carry him to win several early states _meta_end_dot_

 a huck v _meta_end_dot_

 rudy super tuesday is a distinct possibility _meta_end_dot_

 mccain s nh momentum is exactly what his campaign was hoping for _meta_end_dot_

 but his better showing in ia and nationally is still a bit surprising _meta_end_dot_

 in the best case scenario for mccain he comes in _meta_number_ref_rd in ia _meta_number_ref_st in nh and the momentum helps him win mi as he did in _meta_number_ref_ and then sc where the race is very narrow right now _meta_end_dot_

 that would make the race functionally a rudy v _meta_end_dot_

 mccain super tuesday and beyond _meta_end_dot_

 but a more likely scenario is still a _meta_number_ref_th or _meta_number_ref_th in ia _meta_number_ref_nd in nh and no wins before super tuesday _meta_end_dot_

 it s hard to see where mccain goes without a nh win _meta_end_dot_

 romney is staring at a surprising possibility of losing ia and nh for the first time in months _meta_end_dot_

 he is behind in ia but could still win _meta_end_dot_

 if he loses ia losing nh is probably a _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ proposition _meta_end_dot_

 the expectations game is going to hurt him more than anyone else _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_nd place in ia and or nh will be seen as losing whereas for rudy mccain thompson that would be a success _meta_end_dot_

 of course if he wins both or even one he can ride his money wave into mi and sc where he is competitive _meta_end_dot_

 romney could rack up _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ of the early states to take on rudy on super tuesday _meta_end_dot_

 thompson is pursuing the only strategy he has camp out in ia _meta_end_dot_

 if he can make the top _meta_number_ref_ he will get some positive press _meta_end_dot_

 but even with that he is not competitive in nh _meta_end_dot_

 he can compete in mi but if he s _meta_number_ref_rd in ia then romney and huck are still around in mi _meta_end_dot_

 and if mccain is _meta_number_ref_st or _meta_number_ref_nd in nh which is likely then they are still in mi too _meta_end_dot_

 so it s hard to see how a _meta_number_ref_rd place ia finish puts thompson into contention in early states other than sc but the same analysis applies that romney huck and mccain will probably still be viable there _meta_end_dot_

 if thompson could win ia that would be a huge win and give him kerry like media coverage _meta_end_dot_

 he would still not win nh but he could exceed expectations there and roll through mi and sc _meta_end_dot_

 but this is the least likely of the above scenarios _meta_end_dot_
