  the hinzsight report has uncovered an anonymous source which has provided irrefutable evidence that a us senator with presidential aspirations has been sleeping with a lobbyist who had business before that senator s committee _meta_end_dot_

 both the senator and the lobbyist are married _meta_end_dot_

 this is a clear ethics violation at the least and raises serious questions as to whether federal laws have been broken _meta_end_dot_

 as an influential member of the senate military construction appropriations subcommittee senator diane feinstein routinely reviewed and accepted contracts from perini corp _meta_end_dot_

 and urs corporation both owned by richard c _meta_end_dot_

 blum a man with whom she was sleeping on a regular basis _meta_end_dot_

 while carrying on this personal relationship with blum feinstein was responsible for approving billions of dollars of military construction contracts for the two companies _meta_end_dot_

 it is known that blum personally profited millions of dollars from those contracts and feinstein under california law is reported to have shared equally in those profits _meta_end_dot_

 feinstein has since removed herself from the milcon subcommittee citing her desire to remove any appearance of impropriety _meta_end_dot_

 critics have noted that her resignation from the committee as now a moot point as blum divested himself of his interests in the military construction company in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 he still on the other hand retains interest in companies which provide medical care for wounded service members _meta_end_dot_

 the quality of that care has been called into question in recent months _meta_end_dot_

 feinstein abandoned milcon as her ethical problems were surfacing in the media and as it was becoming clear that her subcommittee left grievously wounded veterans to rot while her family was profiting from the occupations of iraq and afghanistan _meta_end_dot_

 it turns out that blum also holds large investments in companies that were selling medical equipment and supplies and real estate leases _meta_end_question_

 often without the benefit of competitive bidding _meta_end_question_

 to the department of veterans affairs even as the system of medical care for veterans collapsed on his wife s watch alright at this point the observant reader will have noted that this is neither an exclusive nor a recent report _meta_end_dot_

 nor is it news that senator diane feinstein is sleeping with her husband richard blum _meta_end_dot_

 however the salacious nature of the headline and the suggestion of impropriety is every bit as valid as the charges leveled at senator john mccain if not more so since the evidence against senator feinstein is actually proven and on the record and not merely innuendo and unsupported anonymous sources _meta_end_dot_
