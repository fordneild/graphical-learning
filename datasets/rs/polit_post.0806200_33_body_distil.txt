  yes yes i know tax havens are a resource for the rich and a terribly unethical way of getting out of paying taxes which we should all actually enjoy because giving lots and lots of our hard earned income to the state is the most delightful activity imagined by the human mind _meta_end_dot_

 or something like that according to the conventional talking points we are all supposed to spout in pavlovian fashion _meta_end_dot_

 dan mitchell that fiendish mischievous heretic offers a different view one that is likely to wreck the next bien pensant cocktail party if a guest there actually has the nerve to speak well of mitchell s writings facts _meta_end_question_

 how dare he seek to overturn the conventional wisdom _meta_end_question_

 how could he be so unkind _meta_end_question_

 after all the state is your friend _meta_end_dot_

 surely you can give it your money _meta_end_dot_

 we d all better be careful _meta_end_dot_

 if the kind of critical thinking exercised by mitchell catches on we might end up actually implementing intelligent policies _meta_end_dot_

 and boy won t the heavens fall when that happens _meta_end_dot_
