  it s good to be the house majority leader but it was like pulling teeth from the majority to make it happen so it is not as if hoyer and co _meta_end_dot_

 deserve any real credit for the fact that the earmarking process is more transparent _meta_end_dot_

 in addition early on in the _meta_number_ref_th congress majority democrats promised that all pork barrel projects would stop completely _meta_end_dot_

 i guess we can file that under the category of promises not kept
