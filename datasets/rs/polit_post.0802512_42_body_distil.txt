  after her calculated attack on barack obama earlier this week during the democratic debates hillary clinton is now suffering from the effects _meta_end_dot_

 even _meta_number_ref_ years ago such a bitter boomerang may not have come back to bite like this _meta_end_dot_

 during the debate clinton told obama i was fighting against those ideas when you were practicing law and representing your contributor rezko in his slum landlord business in inner city chicago she spoke the words slowly with a practiced poise to inject at the right moment _meta_end_dot_

 and it was _meta_end_dot_

 it was the most lifted line from the debate and she has been criticized for using a term that would resonate with black voters slum this morning a photo surfaced of bill and hillary clinton smiling with tony rezko _meta_end_dot_

 she was forced to answer to the photo this morning on the today show saying only that she didn t remember meeting rezko and that her comments to obama were merely a counter attack i don t know the man wouldn t know him if he walked in the door i don t have a _meta_number_ref_ year relationship with him she told host matt lauer _meta_end_dot_

 of course the first couple is photographed with many people they don t actually know so it s quite possible she doesn t actually know the man _meta_end_dot_

 however it s pretty ironic this picture would surface _meta_end_dot_

 no reports have discovered where the photo came from and hillary must be humiliated _meta_end_dot_

 ahh the fun of the campaign trail _meta_end_dot_
