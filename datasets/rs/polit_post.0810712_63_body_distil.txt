  i really didn t have much to say about barry henry o bama s san francisco gaffe but i did notice how similar it was to michael weisskopf s little largely poor uneducated and easy to command _meta_end_question_

 gaffe way back in the early _meta_number_ref_s _meta_end_dot_

 and of course how it echoes one of the left s most celebrated political books today what s the matter with kansas _meta_end_question_

 as george will s very nice article on this points out this has been a part of the left s mindset since adlai stevenson eisenhower s opponent in both _meta_number_ref_ and _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 liberals excel at psychoanalyzing the american electorate and assigning attributes motives beliefs to vast swathes of the american people that strangely enough always serve to make them look good in comparison _meta_end_dot_

 read on _meta_end_dot_

 for example the democrats and their allies in the press can always be counted on to make the argument whenever a republican wins an election in the south that the reason for it can be nothing other than southern racism and the gop s appealing to it in order to win elections _meta_end_dot_

 note that this also applies to some political races in the north whenever a white republican wins a race against a non white democrat reporters generally rush after the fact to attribute it to the supposed racist code words that now seen in retrospect were subtly deployed by the republican s campaign _meta_end_dot_

 many liberals today continue to insist that reagan s victories in the south in _meta_number_ref_ and _meta_number_ref_ were powered by his passing mention of states rights in its federalist small government context in a speech he gave at the neshoba county fair in mississippi in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 of course that he won practically every other state outside of the south both times _meta_number_ref_ and _meta_number_ref_ in _meta_number_ref_ and _meta_number_ref_ respectively is not something they figure into this story _meta_end_dot_

 anyway supposedly at hearing the phrase states rights uttered in philadelphia ms where three civil rights activists were murdered in _meta_number_ref_ southern voters fell into a deep trance and many months later trudged into the voting booths and pulled the republican lever for ronald reagan salivating over the promise of the return of jim crow _meta_end_dot_

 when _meta_number_ref_ rolled around al gore in the democratic primaries introduces the subject of massachusetts now infamous prisoner furlough program against mike dukakis _meta_end_dot_

 the furlough program was one of those progressive inspired innovations in the field of law and order where hardened criminals including first degree murderers were allowed out for furloughs i e _meta_end_dot_

 breaks during weekends and other days _meta_end_dot_

 one of those furloughed criminals willie horton traveled over to maryland and then proceeded to torture and rape a couple over the course of a weekend _meta_end_dot_

 a pac in support of george h _meta_end_dot_

 w _meta_end_dot_

 bush follows al gore s lead and runs the now infamous _meta_number_ref_ second ad featuring a picture of mr _meta_end_dot_

 horton criticizing dukakis for among other things vetoing a bill passed by the massachusetts democratic legislature making first degree murderers ineligible like willie horton for the furlough program therefore allowing horton to engage in his happy fun weekend of rape and torture _meta_end_dot_

 psychoanalyzing the american electorate again liberals and their fellow travelers in the press shrieked immediately that horton s race and not the fact that he was a sadistic rapist and murderer allowed out by an insane liberal program avidly supported by the democrats presidential nominee was what would stick in the typical white person s which would include barry henry s grandma mind _meta_end_dot_

 which of course led to them like the southern voters reagan earlier transformed into racist automatons trooping to the polls to vote republican and which of course is perhaps the main reason bush xli beat dukakis _meta_end_dot_

 in other words let us not be surprised to discover that o bama the democratic party and their friends in the media already have a prepared storyline they would be advancing in the event of barry henry securing the democratic nomination and then going on to lose to mccain in november _meta_end_dot_

 it would be that republicans illegitimately used god patriotism guns gays race most especially it would be some reprise of the southern strategy conventional wisdom and stronger emphasis if hillary is the nominee gender to divide america so they could win _meta_end_dot_

 as a political tactic i must admit that it s rather brilliant _meta_end_dot_

 tainting an opponent s victory as somehow illegitimately won by the deployment of unsavory methods appeals to the worst of human nature by the regular and constant repetition needed to make it conventional wisdom generally tends to get a lot of the politically marginally informed i e _meta_end_dot_

 mushies swing voters to er _meta_end_dot_

 swing in the needed direction for next time _meta_end_dot_

 your opponents flushed with their success generally would not even bother to answer such criticisms until it is already far along in becoming conventional wisdom _meta_end_dot_

 the problem here though is that it s not a deliberate tactic which has no real negative effect on its effectiveness _meta_end_dot_

 the typical new york times reporter honestly believes the thesis of what s the matter with kansas it is axiomatic to him her that people s beliefs in the second amendment religion that illegal immigration is a problem etc _meta_end_dot_

 are secondary issues used to bamboozle the unsophisticated to vote in a way opposed to their interests _meta_end_dot_

 from this it is a short hop and skip to not just believing that people who vote opposite of you are not as mentally all there and therefore are easily manipulable as you are but are also morally deficient in some way _meta_end_dot_

 barry henry s problem is that he brought this attitude out into the open in where else san francisco thinking he was among people of like mind which he actually was and that everyone there had enough of a connection outside of the liberal cocoon to know that it would not go over well outside of the nation s more liberal enclaves if it ever got out _meta_end_dot_

 oh well _meta_end_dot_
