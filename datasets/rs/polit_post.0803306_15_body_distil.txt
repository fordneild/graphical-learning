  a lot of perspective being lost these days _meta_end_dot_

 over heated rhetoric is a glut on the market _meta_end_dot_

 accusations of disloyalty and catastrophe fly back and forth _meta_end_dot_

 first i don t think you win in politics by losing and generally i don t think you win by sitting it out _meta_end_dot_

 but each person has to make these decisions on his or her own convictions and the particular circumstances of this race _meta_end_dot_

 if it is a tough decision for you rest assured than your one vote won t decide this race _meta_end_dot_

 as to the use of your time and money only you can decide if it is better spent on political activity than on your family or hobbies or education or whatever have you _meta_end_dot_

 mccain certainly is in the driver s seat but that can change quickly witness hillary s surprise new hampshire win _meta_end_dot_

 those who can t stomach mccain still have an option in the primaries in mitt romney an honorable man of tremendous ability running on a solidly conservative platform _meta_end_dot_

 always remember the words of yogi berra _meta_end_dot_

 i can t vote for mccain in the primary simply because i know him too well and i think it is ultimately very important to have a president who is a fundamentally decent person _meta_end_dot_

 but others don t agree with my assessment of mccain s character and i ve found that most of them won t be persuaded and some others realize that mccain is not a very pleasant person but they re confident that they can handle that _meta_end_dot_

 beyond the primary i can t vote for mccain in the general but that is a personal thing _meta_end_dot_

 i am comfortable that senator mccain given the value he places on honor would understand and respect my decision if he were ever to give it any thought _meta_end_dot_

 if mccain wins the nomination he will certainly be far more conservative than the democrat nominee and if he wins we will get better court appointments have a better chance of fighting off tax increases etc _meta_end_dot_

 on the other hand if he loses republicans will be back in _meta_number_ref_ or _meta_number_ref_ or _meta_number_ref_ years and this country is too great to ruin in that short a time _meta_end_dot_

 so blow off steam and don t hesitate to be sharp in criticisms _meta_end_dot_

 but don t let it wreck your life _meta_end_dot_

 update several commenters obviously disagree with my suggestion that people are getting too worked up _meta_end_dot_

 their general message are you nuts _meta_end_question_

 the sky will fall_meta_beep_ref_ go below the fold for an exciting update you won t want to put down _meta_end_dot_

 look i remember carter well having been an adult from start to finish during the carter years _meta_end_dot_

 when conversation in my classes gets into the carter years i often make it a point to point out to students what those years were like with double digit inflation _meta_percent_ref_ marginal tax rates etc _meta_end_dot_

 they can scarcely believe it _meta_end_dot_

 but you know what we survived didn t we _meta_end_question_

 we can never know what would have happened had ford been elected in _meta_number_ref_ but reagan and carter biographer stephen hayward suggests that while a reagan presidency starting in _meta_number_ref_ might have been successful it is just as easy to conjure plausible scenarios of ruin and disaster age of reagan p _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 and he concludes reagan s return to the political wilderness in _meta_number_ref_ would turn out to his advantage in _meta_number_ref_ nor were the carter years unmitigated _meta_end_dot_

 that s when deregulation of trucking and airlines began _meta_end_dot_

 capital gains taxes were cut _meta_end_dot_

 the republican party in opposition embraced supply side economics something that probably would not have happened under ford for whom i voted _meta_end_dot_

 the clinton years gave us a gop congressional majority welfare reform and balanced budgets _meta_end_dot_

 and the big bottom line is that we survived both these presidencies _meta_end_dot_

 just as democrats survived eight years of reagan _meta_end_dot_

 i remember democrats smart people mind you who literally thought that the world would end if reagan was elected in a fiery nuclear holocaust _meta_end_dot_

 now if you really think the survival of america depends on john mccain or mitt romney being elected president over hillary clinton or barack obama well i guess you should be really worked up about this _meta_end_dot_

 but i ve got to tell you bluntly if you think that i think you re absurd _meta_end_dot_

 i do think it matters who is elected and i can imagine a time when the fate of the nation might truly hang in balance _meta_end_dot_

 but this is not such a time not by a long shot _meta_end_dot_

 those who might follow my posts closely know that i basically think john mccain will be at best a mediocre president and be bad for conservatism and the republican party _meta_end_dot_

 i think he is a demogogue i don t think he is too bright and i don t think he has the temperment we want in a position of such power _meta_end_dot_

 i urge those who agree or don t like mccain for other reasons to make one more stab at preventing him from being our nominee give to romney urge friends to vote for romney go to www mittromney com and sign up to make calls for romney this weekend _meta_end_dot_

 but again don t let it ruin your lives _meta_end_dot_

 and you mccainiacs understand that if mccain or romney loses in the fall while it may not be good it won t ruin the country and it shouldn t ruin your lives either _meta_end_dot_
