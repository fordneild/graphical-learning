  don t that just roll off your tongue _meta_end_question_

 man i wish i hadn t failed french _meta_number_ref_ times in public school i might actually be able to say that right _meta_end_exclamation_

 i never could figure out how to roll my rs but it sounds so cool _meta_end_dot_

 what s that _meta_end_question_

 what does it mean _meta_end_question_

 oh right sorry bout that or something to that effect _meta_end_dot_

 this phrase while not known to have been actually found in pierre ambroise fran ois choderlos de laclos original work dangerous liaisons has been attributed to him all the same and fits quite well here given where i m headed with this piece _meta_end_dot_

 i can think of no better example of dangerous liaisons than that which firmly affixes the democrats lips to the collective derriere s of america s kook fringe liberal anti war wingnut family who paid so much money to elect them only to see their hard earned money squandered into the abyss of incompetence and abjectly miserable failure _meta_end_dot_

 am i laughing _meta_end_question_

 you bet their booty i am i guarandamnteeya _meta_end_dot_

 sorry i m supposed to be serious here _meta_end_dot_

 pilgrim recently brought us a truly pathetic time line derived from a noemie emery piece over at the weekly standard which laid out the words and deeds of the democrats since taking power over the house and senate last year _meta_end_dot_

 it s fairly clear from this data that democrats have either absolved themselves of any responsibilities for giving their constituents and special interest investors what they paid for or they never believed they would be held accountable or beholden to those checkbooks once they were sworn in _meta_end_dot_

 either way the guinea hens have come home to roost and the droppings are starting to pile up under that cedar tree _meta_end_dot_

 more below the fold _meta_end_dot_

 for all their efforts which enjoyed some measurable successes to break up the gop coalition while attempting to build a coalition of their own a coalition of the insane as it were the democrats find themselves having gotten exactly what they asked for but not what they wanted their incestuous relationships with spending and blackmailing the commander in chief to achieve the inverse of the fiscal discipline they promised along with all that fluff they spread on our peanut butter about new directions ethics and transparency have brought them the lowest approval ratings in american history and include as adam c points out the very real risk that the chump known as senate majority leader may find himself playing the slots after his likely un seating in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 so sad so sad i m reminded in fact of the last democrat senate majority leader what was his name fingers snapping chin rubbing anyway this whole mess about having to listen to the empty suits in washington insist over the last two years that whenever soldiers die while fighting in a war zone we must therefore assume we have lost said war and we should bring everyone else home before any other soldiers die while _meta_end_dot_

 fighting in a war zone _meta_end_dot_

 got me to thinking about good old colin powell _meta_end_dot_

 now i m about to make some colin powell groupies mad but i can t help being reminded of the now famous pottery barn rule that was invoked during powell s failed attempts at convincing president bush not to invade iraq in the first place brought to us gleefully by the malevolent republican president hating bob woodward sorry powell fans but in my personal opinion whatever he might have been as an american hero and a distinguished service member colin powell became a man who forgot what loyalty and service to the commander in chief was some time after he dropped those khakis put on that armani and commenced along with his stick buddy armitage to stabbing george w _meta_end_dot_

 bush in the back _meta_end_dot_

 the democrats caught the same disease and all they have to show for their efforts thus far is a heaping pile of their own broken pottery and now they re paying for it _meta_end_dot_

 powell at least got a book deal and is shindigging his way across the globe with a decent lecture circuit gig _meta_end_dot_

 consider the extent to which powell s pottery barn rule can be applied to what the democrats have done with their cause s celebre _meta_end_dot_

 how have they done on transparency _meta_end_question_

 ethics _meta_end_question_

 children s healthcare _meta_end_question_

 immigration reform _meta_end_question_

 ending the war _meta_end_question_

 making nice with arab and european countries _meta_end_question_

 earmarks reform _meta_end_question_

 tax reform _meta_end_question_

 their little pet the so called government accountability initiative _meta_end_question_

 it s broke folks and they broke it and there s a real good chance they aren t going to be able to glue this one back together again _meta_end_dot_

 after having been forced to endure two long years of democrat bloviations about how stupid our president is how much he has lied how evil republicans are in general and corrupt _meta_end_dot_

 and being made to suffer the fools and their gasps and squeals about _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ being an inside job with president bush at the head of the table it appears that payback time has arrived _meta_end_dot_

 all that drivel and tripe might have worked well enough to get the democrats in to office but where are they now _meta_end_question_

 given their performance and the opinions of the masses on their performance so far i d say they are the ones who are stupid and corrupt and flaming liars _meta_end_dot_

 sucking is as sucking does mr _meta_end_dot_

 gump _meta_end_dot_

 potus is still a scary concept for now but if the congress flips which seems increasingly likely with every new failure on the part of the democrat leadership i m beginning to believe whomever moves in to the white house in _meta_number_ref_ will matter very little by comparison _meta_end_dot_

 we re clearly doing better in iraq these days _meta_end_dot_

 sure there s still a long way to go but of course we re trying to instill a relatively modern philosophy on a culture rooted in thousands of years of contrasting traditions _meta_end_dot_

 sure there are still problems within their fledgling government and yes security is still shaky and is not nor can it ever be fully guaranteed _meta_end_dot_

 but when you consider how sure the democrats have been about the war having already been lost and you reconcile that against bilateral us iraq plans for american troop withdrawals h t my man mark i who are we to believe _meta_end_question_

 our elected president and commander in chief or the dolts bird watching down in latin america _meta_end_question_

 i m with w _meta_end_dot_

 on this one gang _meta_end_dot_

 nancy and harry may have made us look bad to get themselves elected but they suck so bad at this gig that they are on the fast track to getting themselves un elected just as quickly and by the vengeful hands of the ones that got them there in the first place is this not a beautiful country _meta_end_question_

 my how sweet this revenge thing is a just dessert served on a chilled plate _meta_end_dot_

 some things are worth the wait _meta_end_dot_

 this one perhaps most of all _meta_end_dot_
