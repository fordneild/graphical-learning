  friends can be so well intentioned yet so dumb sometimes _meta_end_dot_

 i m talking about these anti mormon phone calls in new hampshire and iowa _meta_end_dot_

 i suspect close friends of one of the candidates are behind the calls _meta_end_dot_

 it would not surprise me if a friend of mitt romney s thinking it d do some good was behind the calls _meta_end_dot_

 that s not to say it was a romney friend but i think that is just as plausible as a huck friend mccain friend rudy friend or thompson friend _meta_end_dot_

 i know some of you might think i m crazy for saying that but i say it based on personal experience _meta_end_dot_

 back in _meta_number_ref_ when i was really getting into running races a friend hooked me up with a congressional race that needed a lawyer for the campaign _meta_end_dot_

 it was right up my alley _meta_end_dot_

 as the campaign went on however i found myself more and more in a management role and less and less in a lawyer mode eventually having to get another lawyer involved _meta_end_dot_

 anyway my guy was a small businessman and baptist minister _meta_end_dot_

 we were running in an area of the country that is extremely religious with a large contingent on home schoolers many of whom were volunteering on the campaign _meta_end_dot_

 and we were doing well _meta_end_dot_

 read on _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 finally one of the other campaigns in the three way primary discovered my guy s vulnerability _meta_end_dot_

 he had affiliated early in his career as a small businessman with a very lefty set of baptists _meta_end_dot_

 he himself was far to the right but the lefties had helped him with his business _meta_end_dot_

 and so the opposition attacked _meta_end_dot_

 they pegged our guy so directly as a poseur that the home schoolers and the church folks who loved my guy got really cold feet _meta_end_dot_

 that s where the friends come in _meta_end_dot_

 luckily i caught it in time to shut it down as there would have been all sorts of problems both real and potential _meta_end_dot_

 as we started going down in the polls and the attacks started increasing these friends who were the top contributors to the campaign and members of a loosely composed kitchen cabinet decided to use autocalls to go negative negative against my guy their friend _meta_end_dot_

 in essence their plan was to throw every bad thing out there they could think of outrageous stuff _meta_end_dot_

 some would echo the attacks but most would paint our guy to the far right a position that would help him while doing so would be done like it was the opponent attacking _meta_end_dot_

 the plan was to throw all this stuff out there and make it sound really nasty but to the person called they d have one of two reactions either hey that descibes my position or good grief that s so offensive i think i ll support the guy just to spite the folks going so negative the fringe benefit was that then the candidate when confronted with the negative stuff could use the that s old news strategy coupled with the this is what my desperate opponents are anonymously attacking me with line _meta_end_dot_

 he d also be able to embrace lots of the attacks proudly _meta_end_dot_

 again luckily i found out about it and shut it down _meta_end_dot_

 but that s why i also think this is a friend s doing _meta_end_dot_

 i think it could even be a well meaning romney friend _meta_end_dot_

 it has that feel to me based on personal experience _meta_end_dot_

 well meaning friends will do dumb things to help a friend in need _meta_end_dot_

 and sometimes they get to _meta_end_dot_

 now my candidate _meta_end_question_

 he went down in flames in a runoff _meta_end_dot_

 we were never able to counter the attacks credibly _meta_end_dot_

 he went on to get elected two years later and has since proven his conservative bona fides _meta_end_dot_

 note feeling the need to reiterate here i m not suggesting a romney friend only that it would not surprise me just as it would not surprise me that it was a huck friend or anyone else s bbf trying to be helpful _meta_end_dot_

 i do however find it unlikely that the tarrance group a very respectable firm would engage in this tactic
