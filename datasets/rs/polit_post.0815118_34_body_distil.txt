  note i m taking a short break from our daily obamafest to check in on the rest of the world in most activities you have two basic choices to make a former commander of mine was fond of saying _meta_end_dot_

 you can drive the train or you can call out the whistlestops _meta_end_dot_

 i naturally prefer driving the train but i can call whistlestops with the best of them _meta_end_dot_

 what i can t abide is the guy who claims to be driving the train calling the whistlestops or conversely the guy who is supposed to call the whistlestops trying to drive the train _meta_end_dot_

 i d submit that this basic inability to either decide on a role or to carry out the role they are best suited for is the crux of the problem with our intelligence apparatus _meta_end_dot_

 read on _meta_end_dot_

 nearly a year ago i wrote this story taking to task a marine lieutenant colonel who gained momentary fame and if there is a just god a lasting reputation as an asshat for writing a crafted for leaking intelligence estimate declaring iraq s anbar province lost to the coaltion _meta_end_dot_

 a report that appeared shortly before al qaeda was driven from that province _meta_end_dot_

 today in the washington post we have another example _meta_end_dot_

 headlined as u s _meta_end_dot_

 cites big gains against al qaeda we learn just a year ago on may _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ the cia was quoted as saying that the al qaeda s success in the war in iraq had created a fund raising bonanza for them in september michael anonymous scheuer former head of the cia s faild bin laden unit of the _meta_number_ref_s remarked when commenting on a bin laden video but what has really changed in the past year _meta_end_question_

 nothing _meta_end_dot_

 the trends that hayden relies upon for today s assessment were readily apparent to anyone paying attention for at least _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ months _meta_end_dot_

 in fact just as the cia was predicating al qaeda s fundraising prowess on its success in iraq al qaeda had nearly been eradicated from western iraq _meta_end_dot_

 we see the same effect in pronouncements from last year that iraqi prime minister al maliki was nothing more than an iranian stooge and a captive of al sadr _meta_end_dot_

 today we see an al maliki firmly in control of his government and sadr s mahdi army driven from basra and no longer a visible force in sadr city _meta_end_dot_

 what has changed in the intervening time _meta_end_question_

 not much really _meta_end_dot_

 the political strength that allowed al maliki to launch the offensive against sadr didn t happen overnight _meta_end_dot_

 the problem in all cases is that our intelligence community seems to be contending for a role as master of the obvious but ignoring their obligation to tell us where trends are taking us _meta_end_dot_

 or going back to the train analogy they are claiming they can drive the train but in reality they are only suited to calling out whistlestops _meta_end_dot_

 so long as this type of non analytic analysis is used as the basis for developing national security policy we are all at risk _meta_end_dot_
