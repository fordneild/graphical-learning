  promoted by jeff from ed morrissey that past week at his new home hotair emphasis added if someone in the gop has decided to play political football with this issue i say we demand to know who they are _meta_end_dot_

 and when we find them we tar and feather them _meta_end_dot_

 memo to gop if you re indeed doing this you do not have my permission to put me my wife my son my neighbors and my former students who now patrol iraq and afghanistan at risk _meta_end_dot_

 it s friday _meta_end_dot_

 we re about to enter another weekend with a castrated fisa regime _meta_end_dot_

 why isn t our side of the aisle the adult side when it comes to national security rattling cages and kicking posteriors on capitol hill _meta_end_dot_

 this had better not be why _meta_end_dot_

 read on from the march _meta_number_ref_th politico who _meta_end_dot_

 what people _meta_end_dot_

 i want names _meta_end_dot_

 and so should we all _meta_end_dot_

 let me explain my take on why a castrated fisa law is a bad thing _meta_end_dot_

 we lost two world trade center towers a sizeable chunk of the pentagon four airliners and thousands of innocent people because our intel community couldn t connect enough dots fast enough to id the threat in time for law enforcement to stop it _meta_end_dot_

 since _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ we intel pogues have gotten lots better _meta_end_dot_

 stovepipes have been broken down _meta_end_dot_

 gorelick built walls between agencies are being breached _meta_end_dot_

 data mining technologies have proliferated and a willingness to share data is growing _meta_end_dot_

 many many of us behind the green door don t want to risk one more nyc firefighter or one more child flying innocently to a national geographic society outing or any other noncombatant _meta_end_dot_

 nor do we want to see any soldier going on patrol or pilot flying a mission to gather raw information that we could have intercepted in safety with our existing technologies _meta_end_dot_

 if we d been allowed to _meta_end_exclamation_

 garbage in garbage out _meta_end_dot_

 you can t mine data you don t have _meta_end_dot_

 and if you try to build a picture of anything with incomplete raw data you end up with a picture whose accuracy is suspect _meta_end_dot_

 every day fisa remains castrated we lose data _meta_end_dot_

 data we ll never get back again _meta_end_dot_

 lost data equals added risk for our soldiers our law enforcement personnel our citizens my neighbors and my family _meta_end_dot_

 if someone in the gop thinks they can put aside the fisa fight to mine political advantage that person needs to go _meta_end_dot_

 that kind of thinking is way more dangerous than any kooky ideas the john birchers ever had _meta_end_dot_

 why isn t the gop leadership on capitol hill raising hell _meta_end_question_

 ed morrissey and politico better not be right _meta_end_dot_

 for if they are i recommend that a whole lot of us start getting a whole lot angrier _meta_end_dot_

 check or hold y all _meta_end_question_

 p s right before i posted this i checked both the foxnews homepage and the nro corner s posts back to tuesday of this week _meta_end_dot_

 if anyone is raising hell on our side over the fisa stall they re doing a pretty poor job _meta_end_dot_

 but hey obama s got a new video _meta_end_exclamation_
