  i was in church with my in laws yesterday for easter _meta_end_dot_

 it s not my favorite church too much of a squishy church for me but i was with family so that was good and for once the preacher gave an easter sermon that though not good was not bad _meta_end_dot_

 as i was sitting there they passed the offering plate _meta_end_dot_

 now normally if i m in my church i m tithing or making best efforts _meta_end_dot_

 i ve got to improve _meta_end_dot_

 if i m visiting a church i ll throw a _meta_dollor_ref_ in the plate _meta_end_dot_

 at this church and churches i have to be at but think are doctrinally unsound i keep my wallet in my pocket _meta_end_dot_

 so my question to you reporters is this have any of you asked barack obama about his giving habits to rev _meta_end_dot_

 wright s church _meta_end_question_

 did he tithe or at least contribute financially to trinity _meta_end_question_

 it s a question if you were worth your salt you would ask _meta_end_dot_
