  readers of redstate and townhall met private first class ross mcginnis on december _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 unfortunately by that time the _meta_number_ref_ year old had been deceased for just over three weeks _meta_end_dot_

 at that time the word of mcginnis s heroic final moments in iraq was just beginning to creep back to the people of the united states _meta_end_dot_

 unfortunately that word never got much past the creeping stage mcginnis was the army representative of the four person profile that i wrote for memorial day _meta_number_ref_ entitled the lost heroes of the war on terror and for good reason because he like the others profiled was still as far from being a household name here in america as he had been before going to iraq before fighting for his country and his friends and before on december _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ at the age of _meta_number_ref_ voluntarily giving his life to save both by throwing himself on a grenade that had been lobbed into his team s humvee _meta_end_dot_

 the turret mounted gunner had been the one man on the team perfectly positioned to escape with his life _meta_end_dot_

 instead he chose to send the rest of his teammates home with theirs _meta_end_dot_

 read on _meta_end_dot_

 ross mcginnis _meta_number_ref_ years old forever originally received the silver star for his actions _meta_end_dot_

 today the white house announced that on june _meta_number_ref_ he will be inducted into the elite fraternity of warriors who have earned the highest honor that their nation can possibly give them the medal of honor _meta_end_dot_

 congratulations ross and congratulations tom and rebecca mcginnis _meta_end_dot_

 your son was eminently deserving of this award _meta_end_dot_

 giving ross s parents this medal in their son s name won t do a thing to help bring their son back but it will at the very least reinforce to them that ross served a nation that when given information about such actions is truly a grateful one _meta_end_dot_

 ross mcginnis is the third serviceman profiled in the lost heroes of the war on terror to have his orignial award upgraded to a medal of honor _meta_end_dot_

 may the fourth one day receive the same _meta_end_dot_

 lord knows he is deserving _meta_end_dot_

 and once that is taken care of i can think of a couple more worthy soldiers who should be next in line for the honor _meta_end_dot_
