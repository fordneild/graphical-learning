  apparently there are a lot of people who are seriously upset over the debate between the democratic candidates last night _meta_end_dot_

 specifically they are upset at the moderating of charlie gibson and george stephanopoulos _meta_end_dot_

 i don t know if i would give the debate the grade that david brooks has given it but as i heard chuck todd mention on the television this afternoon when you have two candidates between whom there are not significant policy differences there will be more of an emphasis on personal issues _meta_end_dot_

 i thought some issues were sillier than others but questions concerning barack obama s views of americans in rural areas and whether they cling to guns and religion were entirely legitimate _meta_end_dot_

 we want to know how a potential president views the country and obama s comments raise the issue of how he perceives america _meta_end_dot_

 no this particular issue has nothing to do with how patriotic obama is but it does have to do with how correctly he gets the mood of the country _meta_end_dot_

 we americans are healthily obsessed with that sort of thing there is a reason why tocqueville and his most famous writing is such a classic of american historical literature _meta_end_dot_

 the examination of american moods mores and norms no matter how minute is a time honored practice and one that we americans involve ourselves in to a tremendous degree _meta_end_dot_

 it should surprise obama not a whit that his comment about rural americans awakened our inner tocquevilles and caused us to debate the import of what he said _meta_end_dot_

 far from being a trivial issue this matter is quite important indeed _meta_end_dot_

 so is the issue of how well connected obama is to bill ayers the onetime weather underground terrorist _meta_end_dot_

 to be completely fair obama was quite right to point out that if he deserves to be questioned on this issue then the clintons deserve questioning as well given the pardon of onetime weather underground terrorists by former president clinton _meta_end_dot_

 but again this brings up what machiavelli said about rulers and the old florentine s words deserve to be quoted again hillary clinton imagined being fired upon because she was sleep deprived _meta_end_dot_

 especially given the fact that she wrote about the visit in her memoirs and correctly did not mention coming under sniper fire _meta_end_dot_

 i am sleep deprived too it doesn t cause me to think that assassins are out to get me _meta_end_dot_

 and given that some of the comments concerning the tuzla visit occurred at around _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ in the morning one has to wonder just how alert hillary clinton would be in fielding the _meta_number_ref_ am phone calls she assures us she is capable of taking _meta_end_dot_

 either the would be president clinton ii needs her rest more than she needs the presidency or she was making stuff up _meta_end_dot_

 in any event this is not good for her candidacy and given the larger issues this comical episode raises and those issues are indeed raised it was entirely right and proper for them to be brought up _meta_end_dot_

 look i don t think that this was the lincoln douglas debates _meta_end_dot_

 it could have been better _meta_end_dot_

 but it was not the forensic train wreck that some are making it out to be _meta_end_dot_

 the obama people ado not appear to have liked how the debate went _meta_end_dot_

 this is no surprise obama did poorly in last night s debate _meta_end_dot_

 at the same time they should not be surprised that obama was a target of a lot of the questions last night _meta_end_dot_

 this is what comes with being the front runner after all _meta_end_dot_
