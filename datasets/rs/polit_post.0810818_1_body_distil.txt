 this was however the first time we had heard the ryun campaign talk about what all of the republicans in the kansas _meta_number_ref_nd are talking about lynn jenkins plan to raise social security withholding taxes _meta_end_dot_

 jenkins actually lead the charge to increase withholdings from employee paychecks _meta_end_dot_

 now she says that s exactly how we should save social security more taxes _meta_end_dot_
