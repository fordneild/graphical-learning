  richard dickie scruggs has been indicted _meta_end_dot_

 you may not recognize the name but you ll remember him _meta_end_dot_

 he s the high powered lawyer that mississippi attorney general mike moore hired to go after tobacco companies _meta_end_dot_

 he s also trent lott s brother in law and lawyer _meta_end_dot_

 i doubt greatly that this is why trent lott decided to retire but it is worth noting that the federal indictment pertains to accusations that scruggs tried to bribe a federal judge to get a favorable ruling for scrugg s katrina litigation team _meta_end_dot_

 and the katrina litigation team is representing trent lott _meta_end_dot_

 the left will be all over this i m sure _meta_end_dot_

 but i think the simpler explanation for lott s retirement is that he wants to lobby while under the _meta_number_ref_ year exclusion rule and not the _meta_number_ref_ year exclusion rule that will go into effect at the first of next year _meta_end_dot_

 and no doubt if he resigned after the scruggs indictment which he probably suspected since they re family the press would have made a huge deal out of it trying to tie lott to the indictment _meta_end_dot_

 the media does after all hate trent lott _meta_end_dot_

 the scruggs lott connection is not the news story despite what think progress and others will probably say _meta_end_dot_

 the scruggs mike moore connection is the story _meta_end_dot_

 moore and scruggs are best friends _meta_end_dot_

 moore hired scruggs to fight tobacco _meta_end_dot_

 no doubt moore knew what scruggs was capable of which is exactly why he hired him _meta_end_dot_

 mike moore is going to have questions to answer when he runs for the senate next year _meta_end_dot_
