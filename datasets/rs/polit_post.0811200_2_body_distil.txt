  the washington post s michael leahy ran a front page story about john mccain s temper that they thought was about his temperament _meta_end_dot_

 in fact they called it a question of temperament _meta_end_dot_

 but shouldn t leahy and his editors asked a question of newsiness is there really a story here much less a front page story _meta_end_question_

 and if not what does it tell us about the washington post _meta_end_question_

 so let s review the facts in the story _meta_end_dot_

 first there is an argument with sen _meta_end_dot_

 chuck grassley r ia from _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_exclamation_

 wow _meta_end_dot_

 that one was racing to get out _meta_end_dot_

 then there s a story from mccain s high school years _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ the early _meta_number_ref_s _meta_number_ref_ and a couple more from early on _meta_end_dot_

 oh and there were two widely reported stories from _meta_number_ref_ and _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 perhaps tellingly leahy says according to aides mccain s frequent comments about his temperament reflect a recognition that the issue persists for some voters and the media the media wants to tell a story about john mccain _meta_end_dot_

 but there s not news to tell _meta_end_dot_

 read on _meta_end_dot_

 friends that s what we have _meta_end_dot_

 another navel gazing story by a media that loves barack obama _meta_end_dot_

 there would be a story here if mccain were to blow up on a voter or a reporter or a colleague on the trail _meta_end_dot_

 that would indeed be a story _meta_end_dot_

 but it hasn t happened _meta_end_dot_

 instead we have warmed over stories from _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ years ago about flare ups _meta_end_dot_

 this is not journalism _meta_end_dot_

 this is not front page worthy _meta_end_dot_

 this is not news _meta_end_dot_

 when there s news they have a story _meta_end_dot_

 they have a pattern _meta_end_dot_

 in the mean time they have a guy who had a temper problem who trying to control it _meta_end_dot_

 and succeeding _meta_end_dot_

 an honest reporter or editor can t turn that into the story _meta_end_dot_

 that won t stop the washington post and michael leahy though _meta_end_dot_
