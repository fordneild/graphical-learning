  the great irony of the democratic primary is that hillary seems to have won the battle but lost the war _meta_end_dot_

 voters believe she has the best experience to become president but she still can t get a majority to vote for her _meta_end_dot_

 people may respect her accomplishments or have fond memories of her husband but that doesn t mean they like her _meta_end_dot_

 lacking a clear message or rationale for her campaign and the charm and personality to connect with voters hillary now seems intent on winning by going ugly _meta_end_dot_

 thanks largely to the inexperience of her chief rivals hillary has amazingly sold voters on the idea that eight ineffective and scandal plagued years in the white house and seven bland pork barrel years in the senate make her the most qualified candidate _meta_end_dot_

 her veteran and dedicated campaign staff and her ability to raise outrageous amounts of money led most in the media to anoint her the frontrunner _meta_end_dot_

 and she rode her husband s popularity and her celebrity status to large national leads _meta_end_dot_

 the media however failed to consider a few crucial issues voter s dissatisfaction with the status quo and hillary s utter lack of a compelling message or winning personality _meta_end_dot_

 read on _meta_end_dot_

 hillary s strongest message has always been that she is the only one tough and tested enough to make it through both the primaries and the general election _meta_end_dot_

 her experience argument really meant that she has been battling the right wing attack machine for years and so would know how to fight back _meta_end_dot_

 she hoped to combine a liberal platform strident promises to end the war she voted for and a reputation as a fierce competitor to win over a liberal base leery of her perceived centrism and opportunism _meta_end_dot_

 the problem however isn t that voters don t believe hillary has enough experience it is that she fails to inspire or excite them _meta_end_dot_

 hillary spent months convincing people that she knew her way around washington and only to find they were fed up with washington _meta_end_dot_

 this is where her experience has undermined her campaign _meta_end_dot_

 over the years hillary s private almost secretive nature and introverted personality has been magnified by the perceived slights and scars of her many battles _meta_end_dot_

 her highly competitive nature has led to an instinctive reaction to fight hard and do whatever it takes to win _meta_end_dot_

 but there is a reason campaign managers and staff doesn t run for office _meta_end_dot_

 you need an inspirational leader as candidate someone to put meaning into the campaign _meta_end_dot_

 it is this meaning that hillary lacks _meta_end_dot_

 she has no central reason for running or a clearly communicable theme to her campaign _meta_end_dot_

 her campaign is nothing more than personal ambition writ large _meta_end_dot_

 when you combine this with her off putting personality and related reputation as an overly ambitious and calculating politician the result is an inability to win the hearts of primary voters _meta_end_dot_

 for the last six weeks hillary has flailed about trying to find a tactic that could make up for this underlying deficiency _meta_end_dot_

 her first reaction was to try and play the victim as she did in parlaying monica into a senate seat _meta_end_dot_

 this was mostly ineffective as no one really believed that the clear national front runner was being attacked for her gender _meta_end_dot_

 her next reaction was to go negative but she bumbled this by focusing on issues that highlighted her own weaknesses _meta_end_dot_

 was hillary going to win a debate about who was overly ambitious in plotting to become president _meta_end_question_

 she recently moved from silly to ugly however when her new hampshire co chair bill shaheen raised the issue of obama s past drug use by claiming that republican s would use it against him _meta_end_dot_

 hillary was quick to deny knowledge or involvement and went so far as to offer a personal apology and soon dumped shaheen _meta_end_dot_

 but it is hard to believe someone as controlling and knowledgeable as hillary and someone as experienced as shaheen acted without any communication _meta_end_dot_

 hillary quickly returned to asking for sympathy running ads with her daughter and mother in a desperate attempt to soften her image with female voters turned off by her negative attacks _meta_end_dot_

 this week the attempts at image softening continue with ads web pages and staged events _meta_end_dot_

 voters however seem to be realizing that hillary offers little more than empty promises and the ugly politics of the past _meta_end_dot_

 despite her claims of strength when pushed she turns negative ugly and increasingly brittle _meta_end_dot_

 despite her claims of experience she has traded on the political success of her husband to attain what power she has and lacks a signature accomplishment of any kind _meta_end_dot_

 there was a time when despite all their faults and baggage it was foolish to bet against the clintons _meta_end_dot_

 recent events offer hope that this time is coming to an end _meta_end_dot_
