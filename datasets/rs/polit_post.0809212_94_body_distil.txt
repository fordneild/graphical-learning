  the ny times reports that long island republican peter king is considering a run to reclaim the scandal tarred new york governorship for the gop _meta_end_dot_

 it s early yet king is up for re election to the house and won t make a formal decision until after the fall elections _meta_end_dot_

 the _meta_number_ref_ year old king may also wait to see how badly things continue to go with david paterson presumably paterson who king had warm words for before the nasty revelations started pouring out will hang on to _meta_number_ref_ but if he were to resign a special election would be held earlier whether other gop powerhouses like rudy giuliani elect to get in the race reports have suggested that rudy might be interested in a special election but not in _meta_number_ref_ and whether king s sometime ally john mccain wins the white house thus potentially offering a chance at a job like the homeland security post it s _meta_number_ref_ years now since mccain sniped that the only republican organization i have ever noticed mr _meta_end_dot_

 king represent is the irish republican army those wounds healed long enough for king to be a vocal mccain backer in _meta_number_ref_ though he was equally outspoken in support of the giuliani campaign this time around _meta_end_dot_

 king is an eclectic sort of politician with a maverick streak of his own a pro union republican who is generally moderate on economic and spending issues but is a confirmed hawk on what his campaign ads bluntly called the war on islamic terror he made headlines in the past with broadsides against subversive mosques more here pro life he s catholic and an immigration hawk _meta_end_dot_

 stylistically his blunt two fisted irishman style is well suited to new york s pugilistic politics and particularly to the always dicey task of translating a downstate politician into support in the rust belt areas of upstate ny _meta_end_dot_

 and for now king is talking a good game about getting the prostrate ny gop off the canvas at a time when the state s democrats ought to be on the ropes themselves read on _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_beep_ref_ i m not the biggest king fan but he s a serious guy who would be a strong candidate _meta_end_dot_

 this could end up being a race worth watching _meta_end_dot_
