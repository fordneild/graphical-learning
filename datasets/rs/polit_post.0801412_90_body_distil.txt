  heading right reminds us that tomorrow is the first day of the _meta_number_ref_ congressional season and everybody knows what that means _meta_end_dot_

 yes it s time for the democrats to kabuki their way across the political landscape again _meta_end_dot_

 i d like to note for the record that only slightly more than half of congress is smarting over _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 the other half mine is _meta_end_dot_

 well let s just say that tis better to give than to receive _meta_end_dot_

 read on _meta_end_dot_

 the major problem for the democrats of course is that while they can try to brag about the following that s not why so many members of the progressive movement supported them _meta_end_dot_

 they supported them in order to get the us to cut and run in iraq impeach the president and take karl rove out to the national mall and burn him at the stake i exaggerate _meta_end_dot_

 this is fairly ironic because if anything _meta_number_ref_ improved the political position of the defense hawks particularly the neo conservatives _meta_end_dot_

 how did this happen _meta_end_question_

 two reasons first off both the speaker of the house and the senate majority leader are rank incompetents at actually running things _meta_end_dot_

 both pelosi and reid suffered from the delusion that tactics that would work on them would also work on republicans so when it was abruptly made clear to the democrats that the gop would not show its collective belly at the first show of force neither politician was really prepared for that and they never recovered _meta_end_dot_

 specifically confronted with the choice between passing democratic policy points by promoting bipartisanship and achieving gridlock ed in heading right called it when he said that reid himself assured that they would choose the latter in _meta_number_ref_ by deliberately using hard line tactics rather than splitting the wavering gop caucuses on the war early in _meta_number_ref_ but it applies to everything that the democrats did not just war policy _meta_end_dot_

 and that leads us to the second reason the democrats own base supporters _meta_end_dot_

 for the record when i call speaker nancy pelosi a rank incompetent as a politician it s not because i think that she doesn t know what she did wrong it s because she has never demonstrated any ability to do something that her own party loyalists disapprove of but will forgive her for anyway _meta_end_dot_

 prior to the _meta_number_ref_th congress i would have assumed that this ability is simply a prerequisite for higher office fdr lbj nixon reagan clinton and george w bush have all demonstrated their abilities in that field but apparently you can rise in the ranks without it as witnessed by the current democratic congressional leadership _meta_end_dot_

 but now that they re there they re stuck _meta_end_dot_

 while no rational person really expects them to go along with the ah enthusiasms of their political base said political base gives the democratic party money _meta_end_dot_

 the democrats understandably don t want to lose any money that they don t have to _meta_end_dot_

 there really isn t a good solution to this problem but the least bad is apparently to for the democrats to simulated some sort of demented red queen s race wrt iraq and hope that the netroots don t revolt too strenuously when the netroots eventually notice _meta_end_dot_

 it all means that almost nothing gets done but as long as congress has its collective re election rate remain astronomically high well that s life _meta_end_dot_

 personally speaking as a hyperpartisan crypto fascist neo conservative member of the vrwc i think that it s all marvelous _meta_end_dot_

 because contra this person from the abc article republicans can run on a record that s mostly see what we stopped besides there are something like _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ house seats whose long term possession is shall we say at issue _meta_end_dot_

 why give the democratic holders of them any breaks _meta_end_question_

 moe lane slightly _meta_end_dot_
