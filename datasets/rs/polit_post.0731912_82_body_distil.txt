 news and world report professor richard epstein professor charles fried and professor gordon s _meta_end_dot_

 wood _meta_end_dot_

 after that my hero justice clarence thomas _meta_end_dot_

 o k professor gordon wood is speaking right now and begins by noting that there is a hostility in academia toward any assertion of american exceptionalism he marks the beginning of american exceptionalism to the american revolution _meta_end_dot_

 he says that suddenly we viewed ourselves as the leader of the free world _meta_end_dot_

 he notes that from _meta_number_ref_ until _meta_number_ref_ when the bolsheviks took over russia america was almost always the first county to recognize fledgling democracies _meta_end_dot_

 after that the united states became much more cautious in this regard _meta_end_dot_

 now michael barone is up _meta_end_dot_

 he begins by noting that for the longest period of time in our nation s history the vast majority of americans and their leaders accepted the notion of american exceptionalism this changed accordingly to barone with the _meta_number_ref_s when many of our own citizens began to hold a dim view of their own country _meta_end_dot_

 he also notes that roughly _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ of all americans believe in american exceptionalism and the other third believe that america is no better than any other country _meta_end_dot_

 professor epstein is now speaking _meta_end_dot_

 he is brillant but man is he all over the place _meta_end_dot_

 trying to summarize his comments is a lot like trying to find a good quote in a judge posner opinion it ain t easy _meta_end_dot_

 finally professor fried is taking his turn _meta_end_dot_

 he beings by noting that what makes america exceptional is its liberty _meta_end_dot_

 he notes that the greatest enemies of liberty are those from within _meta_end_dot_

 he says that the key to liberty is individualism and that individualism is the notion that we are responsible for ourselves and what we make of our lives _meta_end_dot_

 he emphasizes that individualism is not the same as relativism _meta_end_dot_

 he also highlights the glory of the market which he says is the locus of free individuals cooperating with one another _meta_end_dot_

 this in his view is an expansion of liberty _meta_end_dot_

 and fwiw i agree _meta_end_dot_

 during the panel debate professor wood made a comment that i think is worthy of highlighting _meta_end_dot_

 he said that american exceptionalism must mean more than simply being a military or econmoic power it has to be about having a worthy mission _meta_end_dot_
