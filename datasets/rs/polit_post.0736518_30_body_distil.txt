  here s an observation for you _meta_end_dot_

 jennifer rubin captures the essence of it _meta_end_dot_

 in the grand scheme of things it seems to me that only mccain or thompson could run against the democrats and run a race about issues _meta_end_dot_

 let s face it _meta_end_dot_

 the democrats should huck mitt or rudy be the nominees will have mountains of opposition research that make mt _meta_end_dot_

 everest look like a mole hill _meta_end_dot_

 they won t have to get to the issues because it ll be december of _meta_number_ref_ before they finally finish telling us about mitt s abortion plan yeah the dems will hit him with that mike s ethics scandals and rudy s clients at giuliani and associates _meta_end_dot_

 you ve got to go back to the keating _meta_number_ref_ to get john mccain and he s made amends for that in spades _meta_end_dot_

 and with thompson _meta_end_question_

 pffffft _meta_end_dot_

 if mike huckabee of all people can make an ad bashing romney for inconsistency our field is a gold mine for the democrats save fred and john _meta_end_dot_
