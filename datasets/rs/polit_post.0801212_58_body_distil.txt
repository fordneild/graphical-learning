  as noted here national journal raised a whole raft questions on the methodology supervision and objectivity of the lancet studies which estimated civilian deaths in iraq _meta_end_dot_

 now there s another reason to question the results _meta_end_dot_

 from the washington post the number of deaths remains unacceptably high _meta_end_dot_

 because we undermanned the post invasion effort all sorts of violence arose from the chaos _meta_end_dot_

 but at least now we have something that appears much closer to reality and is more consistent with the findings from other sources such as the iraq body count and iraqi coalition casualty count _meta_end_dot_

 anyway i think we can stick a fork in those politically motivated studies which were published by a politically motivated british medical journal and which were timed to exert maximum political impact _meta_end_dot_
