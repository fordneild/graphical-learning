  promoted by dan mclaughlin in the interests of full disclosure doug is a friend and i am biased in favor of him and of this book ae doug feith s war and decision came out on tuesday _meta_end_dot_

 in my opinion everyone who is interested in the greatest challenge to our country in a generation the global war on terror should read it _meta_end_dot_

 war and decision is the first book written by someone who was actually part of the decision making process in the pentagon on and after _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 up till now we have been reading largely second hand accounts that report on events in which the authors were not directly involved and that are thus heavily reliant on selective sourcing _meta_end_dot_

 the result as we all know has not been pretty and the debate particularly on iraq has disintegrated into finger pointing and hysteria _meta_end_dot_

 read on _meta_end_dot_

 to my reading the book does two important things to improve this situation _meta_end_dot_

 first it undermines the accepted narrative of what happened and is happening in afghanistan and iraq with a lucid and well documented account of events told from the viewpoint of someone who was there _meta_end_dot_

 you may or may not agree with all the decisions that were made but at the very least readers will come away from the book with the sense that serious people were approaching them deliberately and with the best interests of the american people at heart _meta_end_dot_

 the story feith tells runs so contrary to conventional wisdom that bret stephens noted that it seems like revisionist history by comparison _meta_end_dot_

 second it provides substantial ammunition for those supporters of the mission in iraq who have had enough of acting as punching bags in innumerable encounters with opponents of the war at work at dinner parties even at church _meta_end_dot_

 in many ways the most egregious failure of the bush administration has come in the area of strategic communications _meta_end_dot_

 by failing to get the word out on what they were doing and even more importantly why they were doing it the administration left many supporters adrift and without sufficient information to refute the now accepted canards of no pre war planning lies about wmd etc _meta_end_dot_

 war and decision provides at last both a logical narrative and documents to support it that contradict the standard anti war boilerplate _meta_end_dot_

 finally war and decision is disciplined well written and tightly edited qualities that are all too often missing from typical washington memoirs _meta_end_dot_

 this is no work of aggrieved or defensive self justification _meta_end_dot_

 doug feith has a story to tell and he tells it well but he is content to let it stand on its own merits and let the reader make up their own minds _meta_end_dot_

 the result is a book that will finally allow the debate on iraq to be an informed one _meta_end_dot_

 so give it a read and let me know what you think _meta_end_dot_
