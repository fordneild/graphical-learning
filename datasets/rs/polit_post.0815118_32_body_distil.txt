  barack obama s campaign tries to play count the lobbyist with john mccain _meta_end_dot_

 now i don t accept the lobbyist bad equation and so i think that this is all a little trivial _meta_end_dot_

 but hypocrisy is not trivial _meta_end_dot_

 let s do a little recount of the lobbyists around obama _meta_end_dot_

 there s jim johnson who i have previously written about _meta_end_dot_

 johnson has represented the former prime minister of senegal and as ceo of fannie mae he improperly disclosed profits that resulted in him getting a big bonus he didn t deserve _meta_end_dot_

 obama put this lobbyist fundraiser foreign agent in charge of picking his vice presidential candidate _meta_end_dot_

 there s francisco j _meta_end_dot_

 pav a his puerto rico state director and a lobbyist for the government of puerto rico _meta_end_dot_

 that violates obama s lobbyist policy _meta_end_dot_

 what have they done about that _meta_end_question_

 there s his chief strategist david axelrod may not be exactly a lobbyist but certainly represents a lot of those corporations that obama condemns _meta_end_dot_

 obama said i am in this race to tell the corporate lobbyists that their days of setting the agenda in washington are over i guess that the corporate lobbyists are elemental evil while corporate admen and astroturfers are all good _meta_end_dot_

 find me the logic in that _meta_end_dot_

 it doesn t stop _meta_end_dot_

 read on _meta_end_dot_

 one person at mydd never bought the argument _meta_end_dot_

 unlike some people in the press she actually checked the senate records _meta_end_dot_

 this is what she found then from nro s mark hemingway there is a lobbyist and rezko money passthrough i am sure that he s a lovely man though _meta_end_dot_

 why is obama getting a free pass on all of this _meta_end_question_

 yet again he is just not coming clean _meta_end_dot_
