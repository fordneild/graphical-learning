  a meeting of the democratic national committee s rules bylaws committee is not engaging television no matter what the matter _meta_end_dot_

 especially when you just don t care one way or the other _meta_end_dot_

 sort it out amongst yourselves _meta_end_dot_

 yeah right _meta_end_dot_

 the real question was do they want to have rules _meta_end_question_

 short answer not really _meta_end_dot_

 rules committee member harold ickes hillary s hit man asked congressman mark wexler there from florida for obama if he approved of the dnc s principle of fair reflection wexler seemed unsure _meta_end_dot_

 wexler seemed not to know of any principle by that name but it has something to do with the delegate delegation reflecting the division of the popular vote _meta_end_dot_

 fair reflection is big with ickes hillary especially in michigan _meta_end_dot_

 ickes levin went toe toe toe with carl levin on this matter and levin accused ickes of desiring a fair reflection of a flawed primary some obama people think that barry should receive a fair reflection of those who voted non committed _meta_end_dot_

 there was an unprecedented number of votes for uncommitted we re told and exit polls and ouija boards inform us that these people were really voting for barry who was not on the ballot _meta_end_dot_

 there was a lot of talk of party unity but it s always couched in terms of unity behind my candidate not yours that doesn t work _meta_end_dot_

 i watched on c span when i wasn t out getting the groceries _meta_end_dot_

 it was also carried i noticed when checking by cnn and that other cable news network the one with the always outraged sportscaster _meta_end_dot_

 fnc carried their money shows in the am and their general news after noon et _meta_end_dot_

 they re going to vote after lunch and they haven t made the case to me for why i should care _meta_end_dot_

 i ll be happy so long as it is a fair reflection of the state of the national dem apparatus _meta_end_dot_

 next time i see howard dean i am going to chant four more years _meta_end_exclamation_

 four more years _meta_end_exclamation_

 four more years _meta_end_exclamation_

 four more years _meta_end_exclamation_
