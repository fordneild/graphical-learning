  the fec today ruled that contributions solicited bundled and transferred by actblue to the john edwards presidential campaign were not eligible for federal matching funds _meta_end_dot_

 good _meta_end_dot_

 but more disturbing was the appearance of david all in the story _meta_end_dot_

 now i know david was still on the hill when we had our last fec vs _meta_end_dot_

 blogs fight and i presume he was a supporter at the time his boss sure was although i don t recall specifically _meta_end_dot_

 and some might try to draw a parallel between that confrontation over free speech and this decision regarding contributions _meta_end_dot_

 but this this is far different _meta_end_dot_

 david s trying to play the everything good for the web is good game but he s wrong _meta_end_dot_

 additional support for government funding of campaigns is deeply anti freedom and free speech and no one on our side ought to countenance any such thing _meta_end_dot_

 there are a lot of places and times to make common cause with democrats and specifically the online left _meta_end_dot_

 this is hardly one of them and instead puts the parochial interests of vehicles like slatecard the sad quotes from abcpac are notably absent far far ahead of the notions of free elections that embrace competition as the foundation _meta_end_dot_

 instead he s chosen subsidy _meta_end_dot_
