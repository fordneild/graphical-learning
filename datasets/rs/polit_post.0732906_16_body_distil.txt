  amid the plethora of comments about the december _meta_number_ref_ referendum in venezuela this story is telling us that one respected polling organization is showing chavez trailing by ten points _meta_end_dot_

 but the money quote is this from the head of the polling firm despite the swing company head luis vicente leon said he did not rule out a comeback by the popular president _meta_end_dot_

 you already know what this is about el presidente wants the venezuelans to legitimize his taking full control of the country with an abolition of term limits for himself but no one else the ability to muzzle the press when he sees fit the power to manipulate the bolivar and quite a list of other things _meta_end_dot_

 venezuelans have had the bad taste to elect this man several times since _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 most polls show that chavez will win this referendum with a low turnout but the poll i quoted shows that a majority of people expect to vote which probably means opposition voters _meta_end_dot_

 by this time however the operative dynamic among the electorate may not be poor taste stupidity or ignorance of history _meta_end_dot_

 it may be fear _meta_end_dot_

 chavez has always hesitated to use the ultimate dictator s weapon the people s fear of disappearing in the night _meta_end_dot_

 if this polling holds up expect the race to tighten in favor of chavez over the next few days as two things happen first chavez election fraud apparatus will swing into high gear _meta_end_dot_

 and second opposition minded venezuelans will ask themselves in their own hearts whether they will be personally safer in the future if they abstain from this vote _meta_end_dot_
