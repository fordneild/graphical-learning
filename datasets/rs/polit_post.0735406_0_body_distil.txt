  we ve all heard the whispers we ve all seen the signs we ve all read the polls hillary clinton is trailing barack obama in iowa her lead is in single digits in new hampshire and within the margin of error in south carolina _meta_end_dot_

 youth and idealism will triumph _meta_end_dot_

 the power of oprah will turn the tide _meta_end_dot_

 everybody s saying she could suddenly be vulnerable lots of people are saying out loud that she could lose _meta_end_dot_

 all of our expectations could be unsettled we could be facing obama after all an opponent who brings a wholly different set of strengths and vulnerabilitites to the table _meta_end_dot_

 don t believe it _meta_end_dot_

 read on _meta_end_dot_

 sure it s tempting to think the democrats will have a real race on their hands and perhaps for a time they will _meta_end_dot_

 but fundamentally primary elections are dominated and decided by partisans people who identify with a party and go to the effort of registering and showing up to vote in intraparty elections _meta_end_dot_

 people who feel strongly about their side in short _meta_end_dot_

 and when you consider the psychology of the typical partisan on either side and apply it to the situation of democratic voters in _meta_number_ref_ it becomes quickly apparent why it will be impossible for a critical mass of such partisans to be convinced to vote against hillary _meta_end_dot_

 jonah goldberg aptly describes how the clintons are playing to their partisan crowd why is this important _meta_end_question_

 because it explains why democrats who vote in primaries simply cannot pull the lever against hillary it would mean admitting that returning the clintons to the white house would not be the greatest of all possible things _meta_end_dot_

 it s inconceivable _meta_end_dot_

 and yes democrats of all people are very practiced at refusing to understand what that word means _meta_end_dot_

 sure left wing ideologues and activists may be willing to do that especially those who ground their teeth for _meta_number_ref_ years and viewed the clintons as little more than moderate republicans _meta_end_dot_

 but not the rank and file of the party _meta_end_dot_

 we republicans have had _meta_number_ref_ presidents in the past _meta_number_ref_ years we can retain some perspective on their respective weaknesses _meta_end_dot_

 besides carter who ended in defeat so ignominious that nobody but maybe chris matthews defends him on any grounds other than being well intentioned clinton is all democrats have and his administration must therefore be held up as all things good _meta_end_dot_

 and if you are emotionally invested in the idea that clinton was a great president and all criticisms of him were manifestations of right wing mania right wing racism right wing conspiracy right wing being threatened by powerful women and right wing latent homosexuality the sid blumenthal theory i kid you not it is nearly impossible to construct a justification for refusing a third helping unless you are morally convinced that she cannot win in november _meta_end_dot_

 and the clintons prior record of electoral success for a party that has lost so many national elections stands as a barrier to that argument as well _meta_end_dot_

 as jim geraghty has noted this is doubly the case because of how hard rank and file democrats dug themselves in against the scandals of the clinton years goldberg underlines how this would play out if hillary is repudiated by her own party heck rush limbaugh would enter the guiness book for schadenfreude _meta_end_dot_

 can you imagine rush s reaction _meta_end_question_

 i tell you this somewhere in their heart of hearts democrats all across this land of ours will enter the voting booth with that miniature voice of rush playing somewhere in the back of their heads laughing and laughing and laughing and they will tell themselves that obama is young and it s not his turn yet _meta_end_dot_

 and they will pull the lever for bill s wife _meta_end_dot_

 remember no matter what else we may think strategically about _meta_number_ref_ if hillary were rejected by her own party every one of us would do the jig to end all jigs over her defeat _meta_end_dot_

 that s a sound democratic primary voters simply cannot hear _meta_end_dot_
