  i ll keep things short mitt romney s win only serves to show that there is no front runner in the race for the republican presidential nomination _meta_end_dot_

 we are as close to perfect equilibrium as we can get and we will have to wait and see whether south carolina and florida will clarify matters _meta_end_dot_

 for the democrats it comes as no surprise that hillary clinton won given that hers was the only major name on the ballot _meta_end_dot_

 but what was notable was the fact that uncommitted received about _meta_percent_ref_ of the vote mainly from african americans who would have voted for obama and who were likely angry at the clinton campaign for what was perceived as racial insensitivity no i don t think that the clintons are racists _meta_end_dot_

 far from it _meta_end_dot_

 but when it comes to the issue of race they have been quite clumsy as of late and they have paid for that clumsiness _meta_end_dot_
