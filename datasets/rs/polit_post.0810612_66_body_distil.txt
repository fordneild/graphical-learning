 do you remember the first professor who made an impression on you _meta_end_question_

 the cool one _meta_end_dot_

 you re thinking about him now _meta_end_dot_

 freshman semester _meta_end_dot_

 he was maybe the first cool adult you met in college or maybe ever _meta_end_dot_

 he knew stuff stuff that mattered _meta_end_dot_

 he had it in his gigantic brain _meta_end_dot_

 he made the boring parts interesting _meta_end_dot_

 and every day he would share a bit more of that nougaty goodness for everyone in class to lap up excitedly _meta_end_dot_

 you never slept through any classes _meta_end_dot_

 he quoted people who you hadn t heard of _meta_end_dot_

 he quoted the french in french _meta_end_dot_

 he was divorced but with a hilarious mountain of self deprecating stories drawn from the experience _meta_end_dot_

 he watched the shows you watched but didn t pretend to like your music _meta_end_dot_

 after hours you d see him not at the sketchy hardwood and lascivious old man faculty bar but the student deli where he would say things like richard dawkins would say if he was cool _meta_end_dot_

 he d bum a cigarette off you without any hesitation _meta_end_dot_

 he d invite whole classes to play cards or just hang out at his pad and talk about things that were important which was sweet _meta_end_dot_

 he was a fantastic cook _meta_end_dot_

 he knew the best bars _meta_end_dot_

 he was awesome _meta_end_dot_

 in sophomore year you d hear about how he slept with a couple of your friends one per semester that blonde from the dorm near his house and that redhead from downstairs _meta_end_dot_

 but he didn t talk to them any more and he wasn t all that interested in you _meta_end_dot_

 if you saw him around he was sitting at different tables now _meta_end_dot_

 he had moved on to the next year s crop _meta_end_dot_

 i care for you deeply my misguided liberal friends _meta_end_dot_

 he ll tell you about the corporations _meta_end_dot_

 the funny thing about the coolest professor is that as you get older most people outgrow him _meta_end_dot_

 they realize what his shtick was all along _meta_end_dot_

 or they go back for a _meta_number_ref_th anniversary reunion and see that same prof a little older a little slower but still drooling for the youngsters who don t realize his message is as deep as a drainage puddle _meta_end_dot_

 it has a way of shocking you straight _meta_end_dot_

 but some people don t _meta_end_dot_

 michael barone s academics vs _meta_end_dot_

 jacksonians thesis shows us that obama s support comes exactly from the people who never outgrow his personality type in fact many of them try to adopt it later in the salon article jessica valenti of feministing bet you didn t know about that blog you damn patriarchs laments the oppression olympics and that it just makes everyone look bad to pit racism vs _meta_end_dot_
