  now that you ve met barack obama s mentor we should point out that this video is part of hillary clinton s opposition research on barack obama _meta_end_dot_

 they ve run videos of little white girls in bed at night they ve run mail pieces allegedly making obama look darker than he is they ve dared to use his middle name in phone calls and now they are throwing out incendiary racial rhetoric from his preacher _meta_end_dot_

 the clintons are not fools _meta_end_dot_

 they see the polling trends that obama is getting less and less of the white vote _meta_end_dot_

 and they aim to capitalize on that fact _meta_end_dot_

 i ll say again what i ve said before the clinton campaign will do anything even destroy the great racial coalition of the democratic party to get back into office _meta_end_dot_

 they crave power above all else and they at the end of the day in it for themselves not the democratic party _meta_end_dot_

 but you know what _meta_end_question_

 this makes me happy _meta_end_dot_

 were the gop to do something like this the media would be screaming racism _meta_end_dot_

 they will never however say that about the clintons or at least not too loudly _meta_end_dot_

 that would shatter their well built myth that the gop gets ahead by playing on racial fears when in fact that s the playbook for the dnc _meta_end_dot_
