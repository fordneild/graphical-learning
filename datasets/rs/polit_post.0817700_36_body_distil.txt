 so what s going on _meta_end_question_

 senator obama is going to ask his donors to help retire senator clinton s debt _meta_end_dot_

 q _meta_end_dot_

 well isn t that nice of him _meta_end_question_

 q _meta_end_dot_

 do you mean that it s mean of him _meta_end_question_

 required of him _meta_end_dot_

 q _meta_end_dot_

 required _meta_end_question_

 do you mean legally _meta_end_question_

 q _meta_end_dot_

 why _meta_end_question_

 read on _meta_end_dot_

 q _meta_end_dot_

 can we start from the beginning _meta_end_question_

 q _meta_end_dot_

 didn t he win the nomination _meta_end_question_

 q _meta_end_dot_

 why does that matter _meta_end_question_

 stop them from defecting and if obama craters in the next three months they ll drop him like a hot potato _meta_end_dot_

 q _meta_end_dot_

 would they really dare do that _meta_end_question_

 q _meta_end_dot_

 ok so why is this factoid important _meta_end_question_

 q _meta_end_dot_

 doesn t she need him more seeing as she s the one in debt _meta_end_question_

 herself the money _meta_end_dot_

 the rest she could probably cover on her own _meta_end_dot_

 q _meta_end_dot_

 so why doesn t she _meta_end_question_

 q _meta_end_dot_

 so why should he _meta_end_question_

 q _meta_end_dot_

 her donor list _meta_end_question_

 q _meta_end_dot_

 hold on _meta_end_dot_

 obama s a fantastic fundraiser right _meta_end_question_

 why does he need these people _meta_end_question_

 that month he raised _meta_dollor_ref_ million in may of _meta_number_ref_ he raised _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ million _meta_end_dot_

 that was only half a million more than john mccain raised in may and obama s cash on hand is actually less than mccain s when you take out the _meta_dollor_ref_ million that he has dedicated for the general election _meta_end_dot_

 mccain of course is taking public financing for that so obama really needs some good months and quickly _meta_end_dot_

 having the clintons will help particularly when it comes to the dnc problem _meta_end_dot_

 q _meta_end_dot_

 the dnc problem _meta_end_question_

 the total numbers you ll see that the gop is currently about _meta_dollor_ref_ million down on cash on hand _meta_end_dot_

 however when it comes to the rnc versus the dnc the former has about _meta_dollor_ref_ million more on hand to spend and i ve spoken with the deputy chair of the rnc they consider their highest priority to be the presidential election _meta_end_dot_

 for that matter the dnc is currently facing an outright embarrassment with their convention in denver they ve missed multiple deadlines in arranging for funding and are likely to have to either cut back significantly or go significantly in debt unless obama can funnel them the cash _meta_end_dot_

 q _meta_end_dot_

 wasn t there an article about obama hitting _meta_dollor_ref_ million in june _meta_end_question_

 this piece of political erotica _meta_end_question_

 let me put it this way we are _meta_percent_ref_ of the way through june which means that if barack obama was on track for that prediction to come true he would have raised _meta_dollor_ref_ million dollars by now _meta_end_dot_

 if he had done that the obama campaign would have paid to have that fact written on the moon _meta_end_dot_

 he will almost certainly do better this month than he did in may and his cash on hand will improve thanks to the end of the primary season _meta_end_dot_

 but this month s expectations are far too high for far too many people _meta_end_dot_

 the sooner that obama can start mining clinton s supporters for cash the less embarrassing it s going to be for him when this comes out _meta_end_dot_

 q _meta_end_dot_

 so he needs her donor list _meta_end_question_

 q _meta_end_dot_

 and to repair her debt _meta_end_dot_

 obama to offer them favors not be asked for them in return _meta_end_dot_

 all of this leaves his strongest big money supporters most of whom haven t maxed out for clinton _meta_end_dot_

 amusingly most of them don t want to max out for clinton _meta_end_dot_

 q _meta_end_dot_

 why _meta_end_question_

 really hated hillary clinton _meta_end_dot_

 this should be their moment except that now they re expected to have to pay down her debt _meta_end_dot_

 it s quite droll _meta_end_dot_

 q _meta_end_dot_

 so what happens now _meta_end_question_

 pause alternatively she releases the damn thing tomorrow to him and i look like an idiot _meta_end_dot_

 this primary has been like that _meta_end_dot_

 q _meta_end_dot_

 um don t you mean the election _meta_end_question_
