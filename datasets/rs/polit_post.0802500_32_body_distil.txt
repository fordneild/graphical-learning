  some of our esteemed redstate contributors have made formal endorsements this year _meta_end_dot_

 i ve held off not because i hate the field but because i liked different things about different candidates _meta_end_dot_

 rudy performed a miracle in new york _meta_end_dot_

 huckabee has turned fewer dollars into more results than anyone in modern electoral history _meta_end_dot_

 romney is an obviously decent man a top notch practicing capitalist and loves america despite america s ambivalent attitude toward his church _meta_end_dot_

 fred could order the death penalty for michael moore and america would buy it _meta_end_dot_

 but none of those candidates are going to close the deal with me especially since fred s out _meta_end_dot_

 i m going with mccain _meta_end_dot_

 follow me under the fold _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 why mccain _meta_end_question_

 why am i supporting the guy who has been a maverick in the senate and who is actively opposed by people i admire _meta_end_question_

 i ll tell you why _meta_end_dot_

 john mccain is the right president for an america still fighting the war on terror _meta_end_dot_

 when cindy sheehan was in vogue enthusiastic supporters in the press loved to say she had absolute moral authority as the mother of a soldier who died in the war _meta_end_dot_

 you want absolute moral authority _meta_end_question_

 john mccain has it if anyone does _meta_end_dot_

 you may get tired of hearing it but it is impossible to render too much respect to a man who was badly injured when his combat aircraft crashed bayoneted by angry villagers permanently damaged by neglect of his broken bones by his captors tortured and who refused to accept an offer to go home as the son of an admiral ahead of his fellow soldiers _meta_end_dot_

 john mccain is a man who gave everything he could short of his life for his country in an unpopular war _meta_end_dot_

 you can t look at that man s bent body and not see it _meta_end_dot_

 you also can t see that same body and not see the fiery spirit animating the man _meta_end_dot_

 i want that man asking americans to stay the course _meta_end_dot_

 john mccain knows something about perseverance _meta_end_dot_

 plus i think he s better than the alternatives _meta_end_dot_

 fred is out _meta_end_dot_

 giuliani is simply unacceptable to pro lifers _meta_end_dot_

 i m one of those _meta_end_dot_

 when the gop stops being a pro life party it can stop counting on my vote _meta_end_dot_

 huckabee is an awesome politician but he still needs seasoning _meta_end_dot_

 this is not the blissful period following the cold war that welcomed another awesome politician from arkansas into the oval office _meta_end_dot_

 this is war _meta_end_dot_

 he s not ready yet _meta_end_dot_

 mitt romney is a one term governor who won his office in a good republican year _meta_end_dot_

 he is a strong technocrat when we need a stalwart leader _meta_end_dot_

 it may not be fair to point this out but our last one term governor with a reputation as a technocrat to serve as president was jimmy carter _meta_end_dot_

 john mccain is pro life enough pro small government enough and a foe of pork _meta_end_dot_

 add in his acceptability on those issues with his obvious quality as a leader for a nation waging war on terror and you ve got the best candidate in the field _meta_end_dot_

 and by the way it doesn t hurt that the press just spent the last seven years making mccain out to be mr _meta_end_dot_

 smith goes to washington i m voting mccain _meta_end_dot_
