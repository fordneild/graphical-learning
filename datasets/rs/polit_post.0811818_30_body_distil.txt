  promoted from the diaries by neil _meta_end_dot_

 so it turns out he s wussy and corrupted enough to be taking payoffs directly and via his wife _meta_end_dot_

 here is today s daily teeth gnashing article for the democrats _meta_end_dot_

 looks like obama had a buddy who paid him really well when he needed it back in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 state senator obama made sure his buddy got paid back and then some with taxpayer money _meta_end_dot_

 from the l a _meta_end_dot_

 times _meta_end_dot_

 read on _meta_end_dot_

 not a bad investment for blackwell _meta_end_dot_

 paid obama a total of _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ and got _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ in state grants _meta_end_dot_

 not quite as good as say a killing in the cattle futures market but not too shabby either _meta_end_dot_

 this _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ per month retainer is not only a large chunk of cash it looks a lot like a sweetheart deal where obama gets to keep the money regardless of whether he actually does any work or not _meta_end_dot_

 if eki doesn t call obama does no work and keeps all the cash _meta_end_dot_

 and this line about the senator advocated only for the first year s grant is another weak defense of his questionable friendships _meta_end_dot_

 would anybody have plucked from all the companies seeking state grant money blackwell s ping pong company and earmarked _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ for them if not for obama _meta_end_question_

 please _meta_end_dot_

 when you get into the meat of the article we see that obama had no money at all and blackwell s cash accounted for virtually all of his outside income for _meta_number_ref_ and _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 that is called buying a politician _meta_end_dot_

 don t we worry when a politician becomes so reliant on a private individual for their very existence _meta_end_question_

 doesn t it make them more susceptible to threats or intimidation _meta_end_question_

 isn t there an appearance of impropriety or conflict of interest _meta_end_question_

 well obama must have thought so because he failed to report essentially the sole source of his outside income on an illinois state ethics report _meta_end_dot_

 if he only had one source of income then the only relevant information on the form is the name of the source _meta_end_dot_

 maybe his custom wasn t all that forthcoming in the first place _meta_end_dot_
