  there weren t many fireworks during last night s debate but one candidate did stand out in a big way mitt romney _meta_end_dot_

 he was good _meta_end_dot_

 very good _meta_end_dot_

 indeed for the first time i thought to myself you know this guy is pretty damn impressive _meta_end_dot_

 i think i will take that bmw after all and his line about bill clinton in the white house with nothing to do was nothing short of priceless _meta_end_dot_

 so what happened _meta_end_question_

 why does romney all of the sudden strike me as the best person to represent the republican party this fall in the presidential election _meta_end_question_

 come with me below the fold _meta_end_dot_

 now i know some of you are thinking wait a second _meta_end_exclamation_

 isn t alexham a big socon _meta_end_question_

 why in the world would a guy who supports huckabee be impressed by some business wonk well i ll tell you why i appreciate and respect authenticity _meta_end_dot_

 i see it in mike huckabee john mccain to some degree barack obama and now in mitt romney _meta_end_dot_

 and authenticity is important because if someone is honest about who he is the likelihood is that he will be honest with me about how he will deal with the issues i care deeply about _meta_end_dot_

 and the truth is i don t think romney is very comfortable discussing the socon agenda _meta_end_dot_

 that s just not his bag _meta_end_dot_

 i wish it was but it s not and every time he attempts to articulate the conservative viewpoint on social issues it just comes off flat _meta_end_dot_

 romney is at his best when he is engaged in wonkish problem solving and issues like abortion embryonic stem cell research euthanasia and cloning require a different perhaps more holistic approach _meta_end_dot_

 i am not saying that romney cannot be an effective spokesperson for a culture of life in this country but i don t think it comes naturally to him _meta_end_dot_

 in fact were i romney i would have said something along these lines to socons from the very get go if he had said that to socons from the very beginning i think he could have possibly prevented fred thompson from entering the race avoided the huckaboom and won both iowa and south carolina _meta_end_dot_

 but what s done is done _meta_end_dot_

 in any event the bottom line is that romney is now showing his true colors and i think that s a extremely positive development for his campaign _meta_end_dot_

 as he goes forward my hope is that he will be frank with socons about his overall record on life issues let us know specifically what he will do as president to promote a culture of life in this country and disclose who he will seek advice from on these issues as president _meta_end_dot_

 be who you are mitt and you may just become the next president of the united states _meta_end_dot_
