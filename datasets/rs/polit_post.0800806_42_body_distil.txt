  the day after christmas u s _meta_end_dot_

 district judge jeffrey white ruled that san francisco s attempt to expand its public health care initiative violated a federal law regarding government regulation of employee benefit plans _meta_end_dot_

 judge white s ruling halted the implementation of a mandate scheduled to go into effect on new year s day that would have required employers to offer their employees health coverage or pay to support healthy san francisco the city s health care program _meta_end_dot_

 the mandate struck down by judge would have required every business in the city with between _meta_number_ref_ and _meta_number_ref_ workers to spend _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ per employee per hour for health care benefits and those with more than _meta_number_ref_ to spend _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ per hour either on their own plans or in payments to the city _meta_end_dot_

 until the end of _meta_number_ref_ healthy san francisco catered exclusively to individuals whose income was at or below the poverty line _meta_end_dot_

 however in his quest to make san francisco s health care apparatus solely the purview of the government mayor gavin newsom had planned to use the revenue generated by the mandate to expand the healthy san francisco program to incrementally include all of the city s _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ uninsured residents as well as to make switching from private insurance to taxpayer funded health care a viable option for san franciscans who already possess coverage _meta_end_dot_

 while providing affordable health care for all san franciscans is a laudable goal expanding government control over health care and forcibly taking money from businesses to fund government programs is the wrong way to go about achieving that end _meta_end_dot_

 instead should mayor newsom s healthy san francisco expansion be funded as originally planned san franciscans will experience very negative results both in economic terms and in terms of the health care they receive _meta_end_dot_

 the money businesses would be forced to spend on health insurance for employees or to pay to the city as a result of this mandate would be recouped by cutting wages laying off employees and raising prices on goods and services _meta_end_dot_

 contrary to what seems to be popular belief businesses and corporations do not have endless supplies of capital in order to avoid going so far into debt that they can no longer afford to stay in business companies have to compensate for money lost in any one area by making or saving more money in another _meta_end_dot_

 in the interest of avoiding the hardships associated with increased payroll and tax costs businesses based in the city may simply decide that enough is enough and relocate to places where they are not subject to laws that regulate the amount of benefits they provide to their employees and forcibly take resources from them if they do not sufficiently comply _meta_end_dot_

 further other players in the health insurance market will be pushed out by their government run alternative which is the one program backed by a guaranteed funding source since government is the only organization that can legally force others to contribute to it monetarily _meta_end_dot_

 the result of this narrowing of the market will be the creation of a health coverage monopoly in the city leaving consumers with no choice whatsoever in who provides their health care _meta_end_dot_

 this creation of a monopoly will also have the effect of stifling innovation and quality in health coverage as with no competitors in the marketplace and a guaranteed by law source of funding the single carrier government program would have no reason to innovate or improve since its customers absent relocating from the city would have nowhere else to go for coverage _meta_end_dot_

 the city of san francisco has appealed judge white s ruling to the ninth u s _meta_end_dot_

 circuit court of appeals consistently the most overturned circuit court of appeals in the country in hopes of having the play or pay mandate reinstated despite the fact that it appears to be a clear violation of federal law _meta_end_dot_

 rather than wasting more of its residents money on this appeal though newsom and the government of san francisco should take the district court ruling for what it is an opportunity at a second chance _meta_end_dot_

 the government and the taxpayers of san francisco have been granted more time to think about what this expansion would do to the city s economy and to its health care market _meta_end_dot_

 they should use that time wisely and act now to bring about real market based not government based solutions for those among them who are currently without health care _meta_end_dot_
