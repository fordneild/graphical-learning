 ending speculation that he had another surprise up his sleeve in this tumultuous election season putin also said he would not as had been widely expected seek to strengthen the post of prime minister at the expense of russia s powerful presidency _meta_end_dot_

 putin last week said first deputy prime minister dmitry medvedev was his choice for the presidency ensuring support by putin s united russia party _meta_end_dot_

 a day later medvedev said if he were elected president he would offer putin the prime minister s job _meta_end_dot_

 if the citizens of russia show trust in dmitry medvedev and elect him the new president i would be ready to continue our joint work as prime minister without changing the distribution of authority putin said _meta_end_dot_

 later the party nominated medvedev as its candidate _meta_end_dot_

 and so putin s cult of personality rolls on _meta_end_dot_

 just in case you think these developments really don t matter to us in the grand scheme of things the financial times offers reasons to reconsider being so sanguine points out secretary of defense robert gates s sober and accurate view concerning russia financial times story makes clear russia is entering a situation where it is facing severe institutional problems made more stark and forbidding by the creation and cultivation of one man rule _meta_end_dot_

 because putin is working so hard to augment his own power rather than augmenting the strength and viability of russian democratic institutions he is priming russia for a series of administrative organizational and political crises a combination of which could significantly set back political and social life in russia _meta_end_dot_

 in the meantime thanks to the authoritarian system putin is working on creating for his own benefit russia will be less transparent decision making will be less clear to the outside world and the ability of the united states and other countries to make accurate decisions concerning russia will suffer _meta_end_dot_

 all of which needless to say is not good at all _meta_end_dot_
