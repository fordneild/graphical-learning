  our own dan spencer made usa today today in an article by jill thompson _meta_end_dot_

 only if you check our front page we don t have a contributor named dan spencer well we do but he does not write under his name _meta_end_dot_

 you actually have to dig around on the web to find out dan s real name _meta_end_dot_

 good for usa today for being competent _meta_end_dot_

 contrast that with cnn last night _meta_end_dot_

 not only did they allow keith kerr s question they invited him to the debate _meta_end_dot_

 had they bothered to research they would have discovered his connection to hillary clinton s campaign _meta_end_dot_

 he s a member of the lgbt americans for hillary steering committee and co chair on hillary s national military veterans group _meta_end_dot_

 he also was an active john kerry supporter in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 and last night anderson cooper willingly gave mr _meta_end_dot_

 kerr the democratic activist a soapbox _meta_end_dot_

 anderson has yet to apologize for either his willing participation or incompetent handling of the situation and failure to research _meta_end_dot_

 consider the other democratic plants _meta_end_dot_

 mary leeann anderson is a known edwards supporter and union activist _meta_end_dot_

 she asked the protectionist question disguised as a lead paint question _meta_end_dot_

 consider journey the abortion questioner who if cnn had paid attention to her youtube profile is a huge john edwards supporter _meta_end_dot_

 and consider david cerone who asked the log cabin republicans question his youtube profile lists him as an obama supporter _meta_end_dot_

 cnn s pre debate spin was that this has all the markings of a set up and heads should roll at cnn _meta_end_dot_

 in the meantime _meta_number_ref_ republican candidates for president should boycott cnn _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ republican viewers should boycott cnn until they fire sam feist their political director and david bohrman senior vice president and executive producer of the debate _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ one or more of the republican candidates should demand a do over wherein we can have a substantive debate about substantive issues that exclude cnn s agenda which is clearly out of touch with the republican party and the drivel we saw from youtube _meta_end_dot_

 though it is rare we take this additional step from a directors post we the undersigned contributors want to make sure our names are attached hereto erick erickson ben domenech dan spencer aka california yankee kevin holtsberry moe lane martin a _meta_end_dot_
