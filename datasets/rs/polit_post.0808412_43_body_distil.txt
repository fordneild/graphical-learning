 clarence norman jr _meta_end_dot_

 is the former chairman of the kings county democratic party brooklyn to non new yorkers and a member of the state assembly _meta_end_dot_

 norman was convicted on three felony counts of wrong doings involving campaign funds during his _meta_number_ref_ and _meta_number_ref_ re election bids _meta_end_dot_

 norman was a prominent democrat serving for _meta_number_ref_ years in the state assembly and head of the kings county party for _meta_number_ref_ years as well as various prominent positions in the city state and national democratic party _meta_end_dot_

 clarance norman was acquitted of charges that he has stolen more then _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ in travel expenses for a party owned vehicle but that was the tip of the iceberg _meta_end_dot_

 he was convicted on violating new york s election laws by falsifying business records and not reporting contributions to his treasurer _meta_end_dot_

 in addition he was convicted of asking a lobbying group to pay _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ in campaign funds when the limit is _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ for assembly candidates _meta_end_dot_

 norman was sentenced to consecutive sentences and is still serving time in the new york state prison system _meta_end_dot_

 while norman s crimes are much more serious then those committed by david paterson paterson s are none the less against new york state election law _meta_end_dot_

 couple that with a campaign treasurer that has a history of sloppy bookkeeping and has demonstrated a history of giving bad advice related to those funds and you have a recipe for disaster _meta_end_dot_

 joan flowers is keeping her mouth shut with regard to paterson s campaign finances as she eyes running for office in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 keeping her name clean now would certainly help but the media frenzy building around the entire paterson story might just keep her name in the public eye _meta_end_dot_
