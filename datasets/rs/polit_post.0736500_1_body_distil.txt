  standard predictions have stated that in a little over _meta_number_ref_ years china would overcome the united states as the world s largest economy _meta_end_dot_

 those predictions were wrong but this also means that china is a lot poorer than we thought which does not bode well for american exports overseas _meta_end_dot_

 the world as a whole is a lot poorer also as mead writes _meta_end_dot_

 in calibrating policy the fact that china s economy is _meta_percent_ref_ smaller than ours would tend to reinforce my longstanding argument that it would be a mistake to push the chinese too hard to revalue their currency since currency revaluation would only serve to make it harder for the chinese to buy our products since currency revaluation would make chinese goods more expensive for americans thus further impoverishing china of course we should note anew that americans benefit from chinese goods being cheap _meta_end_dot_

 on the defense side of course we will have to continue to spend lots of money especially with the wars in iraq and afghanistan continuing and the war on terror being a fact of life for the foreseeable future _meta_end_dot_

 at the same time the fact that china s economy is smaller will remove a lot of pressure on the american military establishment to work harder to keep up with the chinese in defense spending and in maintaining the quality of our armed forces _meta_end_dot_
