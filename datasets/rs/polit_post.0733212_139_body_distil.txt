  bill clinton made a political blunder of monumental proportions when he claimed that he opposed the war in iraq from the beginning a statement even the new york times found is more absolute than his comments before the invasion in march _meta_number_ref_ is more absolute _meta_end_question_

 at time mark halperin reminds us that mr _meta_end_dot_

 clinton said he supported the war in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 on april _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ clinton praised president bush clinton may have questioned the timing of the invasion but clinton didn t oppose it from the beginning on june _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ cnn reported clinton revealed that he continues to support president bush s decision to go to war in iraq there s more including a video the former president s blunder could not have come at a worse time for hillary s race for the presidency _meta_end_dot_

 her campaign has stalled _meta_end_dot_

 in iowa obama has tied hillary in the most recent polling some are predicting obama will beat her in iowa and hillary is bracing for defeat _meta_end_dot_

 as hillary campaign teeters on defeat and needs to rely upon the political prowesses of the infamous comeback kid he stumbles _meta_end_dot_

 clinton reminds everyone as hillary s democratic opponents continue to repeat the clinton s have trouble giving straight answers clinton admitted that answers he gave about ms _meta_end_dot_

 lewinsky during a _meta_number_ref_ deposition were false and that he knowingly gave misleading and evasive answers for the extremist liberal progressive democrats defeatocrats the timing is even worse _meta_end_dot_

 now on top of all the reports about the progress in iraq clinton has provided an opening to refute the left wing s attempt to rewrite history with the false allegation that we were mislead into the war _meta_end_dot_

 thanks to clinton s latest lie we will be reminded again and again that everyone thought saddam was much too dangerous to be allowed to keep the weapons of mass destruction everyone believed he still had at the time of the invasion _meta_end_dot_
