 superdelegates are likely worried and wonder whether either one of the two remaining candidates might be too damaged to lead the democratic party on to november _meta_end_dot_

 and party elders responsible for uniting the democrats in anticipation of november howard dean i m looking at you must be beside themselves with fury and terror _meta_end_dot_

 with primaries in indiana west virginia and kentucky coming up the stage may very well be set for a few more clinton wins _meta_end_dot_
