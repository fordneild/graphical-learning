  late cartoonist doug marlette once opined that the most difficult character in his kudzu strip was the televangelist the rev _meta_end_dot_

 will b _meta_end_dot_

 dunn _meta_end_dot_

 he said it was nearly impossible to come up with things for the rev _meta_end_dot_

 dunn to do that hadn t already been done in real life by one televangelist or another _meta_end_dot_

 marlette would have been more challenged if he had included a member of the far left _meta_end_dot_

 having failed at least for the moment in their quest to have people not including themselves to invade burma to force the junta there to allow disaster relief they now have a new strategy _meta_end_dot_

 send them panties _meta_end_dot_

 seriously _meta_end_dot_

 you really can t make this stuff up _meta_end_dot_

 and you really can t even make up stuff that is more outrageous and addlepated than what the left comes up with daily _meta_end_dot_
