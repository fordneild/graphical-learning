  last week barack obama made some news _meta_end_dot_

 he wasn t going to play the walking around money game in philadelphia _meta_end_dot_

 here s what our own moe lane said our friend barry was going to do the right thing _meta_end_dot_

 not any more _meta_end_dot_

 but somehow that wasn t an la times story or a big press release _meta_end_dot_

 besides walking around money and canvassing money are totally different _meta_end_dot_

 read on _meta_end_dot_

 the philly inquirer broke the story _meta_end_dot_

 barry is playing the game mrs _meta_end_dot_

 campbell is an icon of philly democratic life i wonder if mrs _meta_end_dot_

 campbell will have a role in passing around the money or picking who gets it _meta_end_dot_

 i wonder why obama associates himself with people like her h t election journal _meta_end_dot_
