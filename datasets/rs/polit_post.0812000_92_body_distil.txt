  while it is fashionable to say that free trade policies are responsible for just about every negative thing that is currently going on with the economy not to mention also being responsible for the reason certain adolescents are unable to get dates for the prom the facts tell us something different _meta_end_dot_

 i have said before and will say again that while there is no economic silver bullet free trade is as close to a silver bullet as anything there is _meta_end_dot_

 that we are turning our backs on a policy that has brought us a tremendous amount of prosperity with very little attendant cost is nothing short of bizarre and appalling _meta_end_dot_

 i still dream of a world where bloggers don t have to constantly bring this sort of thing up and where the mainstream media will take the lead in challenging and calling on the carpet candidates who trash free trade and all of the good that it does just to get votes _meta_end_dot_

 i keep hearing that this is supposed to be a tremendously important election _meta_end_dot_

 someone will have to explain to me therefore why it is that the mainstream press seems all too willing to allow candidates in this tremendously important election to demagogue a tremendously important issue _meta_end_dot_

 are journalists too incompetent to challenge people like hillary clinton and barack obama when they rabble rouse on the issue of free trade _meta_end_question_

 or are they just not courageous enough to act on what they know to be true _meta_end_question_
