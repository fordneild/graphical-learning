  as predicted earlier this week and as deconstructed today by my colleague dan mclaughlin president bush formerly and arguably the strongest supporter of israel to inhabit the white house in years used his address at tuesday s annapolis conference on palestinian statehood to renege on his _meta_number_ref_ promise of defensible borders to the then prime minister of israel ariel sharon and to demand that the jewish state retreat to its pre _meta_number_ref_ borders as a show of good faith in its peace negotiations with the palestinian government _meta_end_dot_

 three years ago bush wrote to sharon that as part of a final peace settlement israel must have secure and recognized borders he continued however sharon at the time accepted the president s urging to make this move because of the language included in bush s letter _meta_end_dot_

 on april _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ one week after receiving it sharon told the israeli knesset now three years after promising sharon that israel s concessions would be rewarded with america s steadfast commitment to israel s security including secure defensible borders and to preserve and strengthen israel s capability to deter and defend itself by itself against any threat or possible combination of threats president bush faced with the looming specter of his presidential legacy has moved the goal posts well within the previously promised bounds _meta_end_dot_

 said bush at annapolis tuesday simply as a starting point for peace negotiations _meta_end_dot_

 this paragraph s inclusion was the reason that syria and the rest of israel s invited neighbors and enemies agreed to attend the conference _meta_end_dot_

 whether it was intentional or not president bush by referring to israel as an occupier and by demanding the cessation of the land gained in battle that currently serves as a buffer to attack gave those who would see the jewish state wiped off the map exactly what they hoped for _meta_end_dot_

 in requiring unilateral concessions as a show of goodwill and in expecting israel s neighbors to respond in kind the president appears to be repeating the grave mistake of applying his own worldview and values to a foreign population and expecting their thoughts and actions to be similar to what a westerner would do _meta_end_dot_

 the palestinian people are blessed with many gifts and talents said bush in his address _meta_end_dot_

 he continued not want _meta_end_dot_

 further secretary rice appears to be similarly misreading the will of the israeli people _meta_end_dot_

 on november _meta_number_ref_ just two weeks ago rice said that she believe d that most israelis are ready to leave most of the nearly all of the west bank just as they were ready to leave gaza for the sake of peace _meta_number_ref_ qassam rockets and one kidnapped idf corporal later we have seen how the withdrawal from gaza for the sake of peace turned out _meta_end_dot_

 further according to the a study by the jerusalem center for public affairs public opinion polls actually show strong israeli support for retaining strategic areas of the west bank like the jordan valley apparently in the wake of the gaza strip disaster there really aren t that many israelis outside of prime minister ehud olmert and the supporters who make up his _meta_percent_ref_ approval rating who are ready and willing to make similar unilateral concessions and for very good reason _meta_end_dot_

 unfortunately bush rice olmert and the cast of countries that makes up israel s worst enemies are quite willing to overlook this fact in favor of pushing the jewish state back into an undefensible geographic position _meta_end_dot_

 if there was any doubt about the reason for president bush s sudden desire to insert himself so forcefully into the israeli palestinian conflict it can be put to rest by reading the conclusion of his annapolis address
