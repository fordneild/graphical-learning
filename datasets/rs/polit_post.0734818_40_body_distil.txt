  you know the most damnably aggravating thing about this campaign season for me _meta_end_question_

 i continue to feel compelled to defend mike huckabee and i m still convinced he d hurt the party were he the nominee _meta_end_dot_

 and as i continue to defend huckabee some have decided i m an anti mormon bigot some have decided i must be a huckabee supporter and some have decided i ve just lost my mind _meta_end_dot_

 here i go again defending the guy who i have no intention of voting for _meta_end_dot_

 today rich lowry writes read lisa schiffren s post here _meta_end_dot_

 it drips with condescension which only got worse here enough for rich to notice _meta_end_dot_

 they aren t the only ones _meta_end_dot_

 and all of that is damnably aggravating to me because i tend to think rich is right on these things as are lisa and others _meta_end_dot_

 but the sheer snideness of most of the attacks on huckabee makes me want to defend the guy _meta_end_dot_

 while the attacks are on valid issues at heart the attacks appear to be because he is a former preacher from the south a country bumpkin and a jesus freak _meta_end_dot_

 the new york washington corridor of conservative intelligentsia tm loves the base when it does as it is told but let s not actually let the jesus freaks run things directly _meta_end_dot_

 you know we re all suppose to listen to james dobson but god forbid one of his ideological kin actually takes charge _meta_end_dot_

 read on _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 this is a matter of me writing quickly and running off to a christmas party _meta_end_dot_

 i m glad ramesh ponnuru emailed me to ask what it is that was snide in rich s column _meta_end_dot_

 i should not have lumped rich in with the whole because i don t think he was snide _meta_end_dot_

 my point with rich s column instead was that there are a lot of hits on huckabee at the angles rich takes most of them are snide though rich s itself was not _meta_end_dot_

 those hits are hits that he s a preacher he believes in creationism and he ll creep out the non evangelical among us _meta_end_dot_

 i actually think huckabee could do quite well in a secular world _meta_end_dot_

 his articulate statement on the evolution question for example is one that a lot of non evangelicals took positive notice of _meta_end_dot_

 my apologies to rich for suggesting his was itself snide _meta_end_dot_

 this whole thing reminds me of a john derbyshire column at national review back in _meta_number_ref_ during the heyday of the crunchy con movement _meta_end_dot_

 rod dreher had just written his nrodt story on it and national review decided to stop being the standard bearer for conservative thought and instead become the national geographic of the conservative movement _meta_end_dot_

 derbyshire declared himself a metropolitan conservative and i tend to think it is this class of people who should let the rest of us go after huckabee _meta_end_dot_

 they should go silent _meta_end_dot_

 the more they speak in their condescending manner toward those who are in reality the bulk of the gop base the more they give away the game that they want us in the party they just wish we d all shut the hell up and take orders instead _meta_end_dot_

 derbyshire writes go back now to lowry s column today where he talks about evolution _meta_end_dot_

 remember as well that even mccain commented on just how articulate and thoughtful huckabee s remarks on evolution were _meta_end_dot_

 now continue reading to the heart of the derb s column emphasis in original _meta_end_dot_

 i think derb s sentiment from back in _meta_number_ref_ is revealing itself now _meta_end_dot_

 the new york washington corridor of conservative intelligentsia tm bristles at the idea that a back water social conservative from arkansas has excited the base in a way the others haven t _meta_end_dot_

 we were after all suppose to go for romney or rudy _meta_end_dot_

 they told us so _meta_end_dot_

 i don t want to defend mike huckabee _meta_end_dot_

 he s not my candidate _meta_end_dot_

 i don t yet see any major reasons to trust him on fiscal issues though he did say he wants to kill the corporate income tax _meta_end_dot_

 but it s a sad day in the conservative movement when the conservative intelligentsia has sustained harsher words for a socially conservative governor than a serial adulterer who has said this year that the government should provide assistance to poor women wanting abortions _meta_end_dot_

 there are attacks to be made on huckabee _meta_end_dot_

 but i think most of those who are making them are only helping huckabee because the snideness of their tone overshadows the accuracy of their attacks _meta_end_dot_
