  no no _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 not the softball interview from bill moyers _meta_end_dot_

 this is reverend wright fresh this morning at the national press club _meta_end_dot_

 it should be fun _meta_end_dot_

 i ll be watching it _meta_end_dot_

 by the way i noticed that obama told chris wallace that wright was his former pastor _meta_end_dot_

 who is obama s current pastor _meta_end_question_

 or has he decided to get with the liberal program and go un churched _meta_end_dot_

 i mean it s not like he was actually going to church with wright or else he surely would have heard enough stuff to realize his spiritual advisor is nuts _meta_end_dot_

 update reverend wright by the way says he is not running for the white house he s running for jesus that must be the black jesus who was killed by the romans who were italians who were europeans who were white people not actually the jewish guy reverend wright s friends calypso louis farrakhan and moammar kadafi would denounce for being a jew _meta_end_dot_

 my review of the speech is below the fold _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 he s all about the african american religious experience and as he jokes the unknown phenomenon of the black church they laugh _meta_end_dot_

 he s making the case that the black church has been around in this land since the _meta_number_ref_ s but is largely invisible _meta_end_dot_

 it is mind you the black religious experience and not the black christian religious experience wright is largely right now going through the bullet points on the black church experience in its historic context _meta_end_dot_

 now here we go reverend wright calls what happened to him the most recent attack on the black church it did not happen to jeremiah wright he says but the black church _meta_end_dot_

 good grief _meta_end_dot_

 this guy really is incapable of taking personal blame _meta_end_dot_

 now i know where obama gets it from _meta_end_dot_

 wright also says basically that some of us are too ignorant to know what he s talking about because it takes years of education _meta_end_dot_

 now he s talking about imperialism and the upper classes and liberation theology formed in the sixties mostly from south america _meta_end_dot_

 wright says he doesn t like to use the phrase black liberation theology though he agrees with what it means _meta_end_dot_

 he says he calls it the prophetic theology of the black church he says he s suppose to say what he says based on scripture _meta_end_dot_

 to sum up where we are now black preaching and black culture are no deficient they are just different _meta_end_dot_

 he says black preaching is not bombastic just different _meta_end_dot_

 after a long while rev _meta_end_dot_

 wright points out that his congregation supported the communists in latin america while ollie north was supporting the contras just great _meta_end_dot_

 now he says his congregation feeds the poor while the government cuts food stamps and fights an unjust war _meta_end_dot_

 then he plays the chicken hawk card saying people who are calling him unpatriotic are using their privilege to keep their kids out of war while his goddaughter is in iraq _meta_end_dot_

 now he s playing the race card highlighting the discrepancy between black men going to jail with crack cocaine versus white men going to jail for powder cocaine _meta_end_dot_

 he has shifted now to prophetic black theology requires reconciliation _meta_end_dot_

 he quotes lefty jim wallis _meta_end_dot_

 he moves back to white versus black _meta_end_dot_

 that pretty much defines him _meta_end_dot_

 he says we need to recognize differences and that differences do not make us deficient _meta_end_dot_

 yet i go back to his statements that the u s _meta_end_dot_

 invented aids and god d_meta_beep_ref_n america _meta_end_dot_

 he s nutty _meta_end_dot_

 now he asked to explain the whole u s _meta_end_dot_

 brought _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ on itself he says he was quoting the iraqi ambassador but that you cannot do terrorism unto others without terrorism being done to you _meta_end_dot_

 he says he served six years in the military _meta_end_dot_

 does that make me unpatriotic _meta_end_question_

 how many years did cheney serve he s hurting himself in the questions _meta_end_dot_

 he says louis farrakhan is one of the most important voices in the _meta_number_ref_th and _meta_number_ref_st centuries _meta_end_dot_

 he also pretty much signals him agreement with mandela that castro is not an enemy _meta_end_dot_

 wright says he says what he says because he is a preacher _meta_end_dot_

 obama says what he says to get elected president _meta_end_dot_

 wright implies pretty directly that obama is saying what he s saying because otherwise he could never get elected _meta_end_dot_

 he says the government grinds under people he says he is not condemning the american people but the government _meta_end_dot_

 he says he told obama that if obama got elected he d be coming after him too _meta_end_dot_

 he says this country s leaders have refused to apologize for slavery _meta_end_dot_

 wright strongly implies that obama is not a regular church goer _meta_end_dot_

 now he goes on about hiv _meta_end_dot_

 he says he read a number of books and after the tuskegee experiments he believes the government is capable of anything _meta_end_dot_

 yes i believe we are capable on israel he says israel and israelis have a right to exist and they need to reconcile themselves to each other and their neighbors _meta_end_dot_

 he stands by his comparison of the roman army and the marines as forms of imperialism _meta_end_dot_

 he also says white christians need to understand their history when they raped the continent he totally totally dodges the question of whether islam is a path to salvation _meta_end_dot_

 his answer implies that it is _meta_end_dot_
