  daniel griswold dispels some bizarre myths surrounding the issue of free trade and argues that the last thing republicans should do is to become protectionists _meta_end_dot_

 i wonder whether robert lighthizer actually wrote his arguments with a straight face _meta_end_dot_

 i know that i couldn t keep one as i read his editorial my jaw was very uncooperative with my efforts to keep a straight face because it kept hitting the floor in absolute shock _meta_end_dot_

 maybe ramesh ponnuru is busy picking his jaw off the floor as well _meta_end_dot_

 just a hunch _meta_end_dot_

 and good grief jaw dropping is contagious _meta_end_dot_
