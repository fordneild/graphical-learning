  i am more than willing to give barack obama props for having gone on fox news sunday to discuss campaign issues with chris wallace _meta_end_dot_

 as most political observers know the folks on the other side of the partisan divide don t particularly like it when any of their own go on fox they seem to think that it would be best to boycott the station and let it suffer in the ratings and in the revenue department _meta_end_dot_

 the fact that this plan has failed thus far does not deter them but in any event if you really want to get your message out on fox you ought to go on the show instead of boycotting the show and letting your political opponents completely dictate the tone and tenor of fox s editorial content _meta_end_dot_

 to the extent that republicans stay away from interviews on npr i would focus the same criticism at them as well but of course obama s actions cause a great deal of heartburn for his fellow democrats _meta_end_dot_

 greg sargent is devastated and disconsolate _meta_end_dot_

 jerome armstrong is more temperate about matters but cannot be pleased perhaps armstrong a hillary supporter can be sanguine about obama s appearance because he predicted its nature _meta_end_dot_

 matt stoller graces the public discourse by informing us that you can t trust the obama campaign they will lie to you to promote right wing institutions fatuous nonsense but hey i am in favor of anything that keeps the nomination contest going and going and going and _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 you get the point _meta_end_dot_

 the patron saint of the _meta_number_ref_ democratic presidential nomination contest ought to be orville redenbacher _meta_end_dot_

 honestly _meta_end_dot_

 we might even get a cardinal to help advance st _meta_end_dot_

 orville s case _meta_end_dot_
