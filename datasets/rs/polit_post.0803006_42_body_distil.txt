  because of passages like this one read on _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 yes it s geeky _meta_end_dot_

 yes it s nerdy _meta_end_dot_

 i like geeks _meta_end_dot_

 i like nerds _meta_end_dot_

 i like smart people and smart people like mitt romney are loaded with potential _meta_end_dot_

 which is why i am as outraged as ben domenech over the fact that romney apparently decided to launch a last minute attack on john mccain for opposing the medicare prescription drug benefit program _meta_end_dot_

 let me get this straight romney the newly minted small government conservative now believes that it is a good idea to have government expand entitlement programs _meta_end_question_

 and if republicans disagree out of a no doubt quaint respect to the idea of limited government they are to be attacked for it _meta_end_question_

 i guess that this rant concerning romney s decidedly non free market stance on a whole host of economic issues was warranted then _meta_end_dot_

 and yes there are plenty of other republican candidates who are guilty of having forgotten the need for and value of free markets _meta_end_dot_

 but voting against the prescription drug benefit should constitute a no brainer for any self respecting small government type _meta_end_dot_

 it certainly should constitute a no brainer for someone like romney who presents himself as an expert on all aspects of economics _meta_end_dot_

 perhaps at some point in time romney would be so kind to inform the rest of us how we are supposed to take him seriously as a small government republican if he can t even get this issue right _meta_end_question_

 i want to like mitt romney _meta_end_dot_

 i would very much like to get on board with his campaign even at this late stage with mccain within kissing distance of the nomination _meta_end_dot_

 but he certainly appears to be determined to make it hard for me to do so _meta_end_dot_
