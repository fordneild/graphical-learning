  no one really is sure _meta_end_dot_

 and i have harped on this exact point for quite a long time _meta_end_dot_

 i don t care how famous a particular candidate is _meta_end_dot_

 i don t care how amazing it would be for history if that particular candidate got elected to the presidency and i certainly don t care how personally pathbreaking such an election might be _meta_end_dot_

 candidates have to have a reason to seek the office they seek a reason that is entirely independent of their personalities and or their personal identities _meta_end_dot_

 that reason has to do more with the realm of ideas and less with the issue of personalities altogether _meta_end_dot_

 and when there is no underlying reason or rationale to a candidacy that candidacy falls apart pretty quickly _meta_end_dot_

 so it should come as no surprise that hillary clinton is running into some strong headwinds these days _meta_end_dot_

 i imagine that she still will win the democratic presidential nomination she is well funded and she has a very good staff working for her _meta_end_dot_

 but apart from her fame and identity she has given no one any reason to vote for her _meta_end_dot_

 when he thought about running for the presidency again in _meta_number_ref_ george mcgovern asked of all people his old foe richard nixon the two had become friends what nixon thought of a possible mcgovern candidacy _meta_end_dot_

 nixon told mcgovern that he should only run if he had something to say and if no one else was saying it _meta_end_dot_

 i thought that was damn good advice recollected mcgovern later _meta_end_dot_

 and he decided not to make the race _meta_end_dot_

 i wonder if at the end of the race for the presidency hillary clinton might realize the wisdom of that advice _meta_end_dot_
