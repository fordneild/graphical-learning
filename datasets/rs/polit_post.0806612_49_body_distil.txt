  back in november i wrote about the fall of the us dollar here and here _meta_end_dot_

 the decline was just getting under way at that point as cuts in us policy interest rates started having their effect _meta_end_dot_

 since then the federal reserve has cut still farther _meta_end_dot_

 in november the dollar had fallen to _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ against the euro before recovering somewhat _meta_end_dot_

 the trend was intact however and now the dollar is all the way down to _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 the betting is that the fed funds rate will fall to _meta_number_ref_ _meta_percent_ref_ this month so the dollar probably has farther to fall _meta_end_dot_

 is this really bad news _meta_end_question_

 or more like neutral _meta_end_question_

 read on _meta_end_dot_

 the united states is in a remarkable position with respect to the management of our currency _meta_end_dot_

 the dollar is still the primary reserve currency _meta_end_dot_

 even after recent gains by the euro some _meta_percent_ref_ of world central bank assets are dollar denominated _meta_end_dot_

 many global commodities are priced in dollars including oil industrial metals and staple foodstuffs _meta_end_dot_

 and some key industries like airliners and even whole economies like china are closely tied to the greenback _meta_end_dot_

 we have thus been able to pursue an extremely loose monetary policy in recent months without suffering tremendously from the resulting inflationary effects _meta_end_dot_

 instead we have been able to simply export our inflation to other countries who are feeling the pinch much more than we are _meta_end_dot_

 our economy is much less affected by commodity price inflation including higher oil prices than others are in addition we continue to benefit from one of the most unusual phenomena in financial history a continuing savings glut in which banking and government authorities in many developing countries choose to store huge amounts of money in the form of us government debt _meta_end_dot_

 so there appears to be both a structural basis as well as a policy basis for the continuation of low us interest rates across the yield curve _meta_end_dot_

 and that suggests that the ingredients are in place for long term dollar weakness _meta_end_dot_

 given a choice why would everyone else in the world continue their exposure to the us economy and suffer the effects of our currency weakness including ragingly high commodity prices _meta_end_question_

 intertia is one reason _meta_end_dot_

 and don t underestimate it _meta_end_dot_

 look at the huge capital losses that central banks are taking on their dollar reserves _meta_end_dot_

 if you don t sell under these circumstances it s hard to imagine when you would ever sell another is the fact that it s generally quite easy to do business in the us _meta_end_dot_

 free markets really are a good idea after all most importantly however the us continues to be a demand driver for the rest of the world _meta_end_dot_

 we re completely willing to buy stuff from other people _meta_end_dot_

 and they re completely willing to keep selling stuff to us as long as one of two things remains true either we have stuff to sell them that they want or they continue to be willing to hold our currency _meta_end_dot_

 for decades now the substance of countless scare stories has been that indeed the rest of the world will someday decide to stop holding our dollars _meta_end_dot_

 and then the sky will fall _meta_end_dot_

 but it hasn t _meta_end_dot_

 it s quite true that certain traditional buyers have considerably reduced their demand for us debt over the past year _meta_end_dot_

 the chinese barely show up at our long term treasury debt auctions anymore _meta_end_dot_

 but still the auctions succeed and long term interest rates continue to be very low _meta_end_dot_

 and strong demand for us capital assets continues _meta_end_dot_

 ultimately the people who manage sovereign wealth have to invest somewhere _meta_end_dot_

 and they ve been buying stock in american companies especially distressed financials and hedging against dollar inflation by buying stock in commodity producers around the world _meta_end_dot_

 another scare story is that the rest of the world will start generating its own final demand and then no one will need us _meta_end_dot_

 while the first part of this has definitely been happening the second has not happened and won t happen _meta_end_dot_

 our economy is just too big and too tightly integrated with everyone else s _meta_end_dot_

 why would readers of a conservative political blog care about all this _meta_end_question_

 because it s up to us to promote government economic policies that preserve the basis for continued high living standards in the us _meta_end_dot_

 the weak dollar doesn t concern me per se _meta_end_dot_

 what does concern me a great deal is that the productive capacity of the us will increasingly be diverted into areas that generate relatively little tradable value _meta_end_dot_

 and this in fact is a political issue _meta_end_dot_

 because one of the largest growth industries in the united states is government _meta_end_dot_

 regardless of who is elected president in the fall there will be continued political pressure to increase the commitments of all levels of government as a proportion of the total economy _meta_end_dot_

 and although i would welcome discussion on this point it s probably inevitable that this will continue _meta_end_dot_

 that s a problem because the government business doesn t operate so as to maximize economic utility as private business does _meta_end_dot_

 like any large business enterprise the government seeks primarily to entrench and extend its power _meta_end_dot_

 but the people who fund the government generally do not counteract its desire to maximize power at the expense of utility as is the case with private businesses _meta_end_dot_

 and who are the people that fund the government _meta_end_question_

 well there s us taxpayers but we don t really count because we have no free choice in the matter _meta_end_dot_

 but there are all those people around the world who are holding our dollars and decide by their actions on a daily basis whether to continue to do so _meta_end_dot_

 so far inertia and american generated demand are working in our favor _meta_end_dot_

 in addition the accumulation of american capital assets by foreigners will continue _meta_end_dot_

 european companies like airbus will respond to the weaker dollar by transitioning more of their cost base from euros to dollars especially as their currency hedges start to run off _meta_end_dot_

 translated from geek speak that means they ll start building things in the us just as the japanese have been doing for twenty five years so the sky isn t falling _meta_end_dot_

 yet _meta_end_dot_
