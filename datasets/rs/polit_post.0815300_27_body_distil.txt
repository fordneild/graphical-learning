  aoshq let us look at the last set of numbers _meta_end_dot_

 as per tgp there are _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ votes there are too many half delegates now to ignore either candidate will thus need _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ votes to win _meta_end_dot_

 obama has _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ not including super delegates votes clinton has _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ not including super delegates _meta_end_dot_

 there are _meta_number_ref_ pledged votes left and _meta_number_ref_ super delegate votes obama needs _meta_number_ref_ votes or twice what plouffe is telling everybody that he needs clinton needs _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 obama will not get _meta_percent_ref_ of the remaining pledged votes in the next three elections so he needs more super delegates _meta_end_dot_

 clinton needs to poach a significant portion of obama s existing support to win at the convention _meta_end_dot_

 as _meta_percent_ref_ of his support is pretty much free to jump at any time this is not actually impossible how probable is of course the question _meta_end_dot_

 so essentially today has made it impossible for obama to even claim that he s clinched the nomination after mt sd s results without last minute super delegate additions confirmed that clinton s only real chance is in raiding obama s existing supporters and put the remaining uncommitted super delegates in a position where they are going to be reviled whether they jump one way the other or especially not at all _meta_end_dot_

 conclusions _meta_end_question_

 don t ever put the democratic party in charge of planning your wedding _meta_end_dot_
