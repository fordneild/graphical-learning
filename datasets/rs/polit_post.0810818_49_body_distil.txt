  we have well documented barack obama s marxist underpinnings _meta_end_dot_

 his wife his preacher his mother his father his childhood mentor and his neighbor bill ayers all have underlying beliefs in marxism _meta_end_dot_

 they share a disdain for capitalism capital and job providers _meta_end_dot_

 they are all swept up in the call for social change _meta_end_dot_

 and obama has been right there with them _meta_end_dot_

 we get glimpses every once in a while obama rails against corporate special interests and denies taking money from them while using them to raise his money and while actually getting money from them _meta_end_dot_

 obama expresses his distain for religion as a crutch for humanity echoing marx s view that religion is an opiate for the masses _meta_end_dot_

 obama decries the unfairness of the rich while expressing his connection to the proletariat despite not being one of them _meta_end_dot_

 there is a growing sense though both among some clinton supporters and those of us on the right that we re at a tipping point and it is a point that requires the press to dig a bit deeper _meta_end_dot_

 obama s ties to terrorist bill ayers and his terrorist wife are often played down by the obama campaign but they are only disputed by obama s chief strategist _meta_end_dot_

 in fact obama s present successful political career was started in bill ayers s living room _meta_end_dot_

 tony rezko and saddam loyalist nadhmi auchi with whom obama tries to play down his relationship _meta_end_dot_

 nonetheless obama appears to have yet again lied to cover up his toasting of nadhmi _meta_end_dot_

 equally disturbing is obama s willingness to take money from code pink activists that particularly repugnant group that harasses our military assaults our elected officials and accuses our heros of being war criminals _meta_end_dot_

 obama has no problem with their money or their support _meta_end_dot_

 in fact his rhetoric frequently appeals to this group and its supporters because it is so anti american military or rather anti imperalist _meta_end_dot_

 maybe all these things combined send signals to those who live in that world _meta_end_dot_

 the signals are seemingly so strong that obama has a terrorist fan club of sorts _meta_end_dot_

 we should review the members _meta_end_dot_

 read on _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 we have someone with alleged plo links rashid khalidi holding a fundraiser for obama _meta_end_dot_

 then there is this author of the site electric intifada who characterized the old obama he believes obama is is enthralled by the rise of obama _meta_end_dot_

 are on board the obama nation bandwagon _meta_end_dot_

 we hope he will win the election ahmed yusuf said _meta_end_dot_

 we also have the curious affair between obama and communist terrorist group farc _meta_end_dot_

 it s not exactly clear if farc associates got time with obama but we know documents seized from farc show farc believes obama will win the election which will be good for farc and venezuela and bad for american ally columbia an ally the democrats and labor unions are already working very hard to undermine because of columbia s aggressive posture against communist infiltration into the columbian labor movement _meta_end_dot_

 if that s not enough fidel castro loves barack obama and this obama and clinton should team up _meta_end_dot_

 let s also not forget barack obama s aggressive willingness to preemptively kowtow to the chinese regime over the olympics _meta_end_dot_

 it s very hard to tell your banker that he s wrong obama said _meta_end_dot_

 and we should remember that jimmy carter who never met a foe of america without embracing them as a kindred soul also likes obama and is even now considering an endorsement of obama _meta_end_dot_

 at some point we should be concerned that so many enemies of this country enemies who are proud to be enemies of this country and enemies of liberty are supporting a man like barack obama _meta_end_dot_

 why do they support him _meta_end_question_

 what do they see in barack obama _meta_end_question_

 all i can think of is they see an inexperienced politician who has already been raised in their marxist world view who has already signaled his intentions to surrender america abroad and defeat individualistic american independence at home _meta_end_dot_

 that would be the only way to rid this nation of what obama s wife views as its mean spirited nature _meta_end_dot_

 but are we ready to elect a man our enemies see as a man with a strong propensity to actively strive to take us out of first place _meta_end_question_

 why does this rogue s gallery of terrorists communists and other american enemies support obama _meta_end_question_
