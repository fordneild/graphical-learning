  thanks to reuters for the tasty headline quoted above that really rams home the fact that the democrat led house of representatives has once again given president bush pretty much exactly what he asked for on that pesky little war they inconveniently promised to end if elected in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 well i suppose that the inconvenience is more felt on the part of those friendly gullible netroots who ate up the knowingly insincere promises of the democrats they donated so much time treasure and typing to _meta_end_dot_

 voting results are here _meta_end_dot_

 guess those blood soaked dollar bills code pink protesters planned to shower the voting members with during tonight s polling didn t convince any of them overmuch _meta_end_dot_

 it s a shame i hear they were dipped in the actual blood of the iraqi children the witches of code pink keep fighting so hard to abandon to the mercy of terrorists in iraq _meta_end_dot_

 well maybe not _meta_end_dot_

 but would it honestly surprise anybody _meta_end_question_

 updated below the fold _meta_end_dot_

 according to roll call now get back to your computers get your credit cards out and give them more money _meta_end_dot_

 it s an election year after all _meta_end_exclamation_
