 update _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ kurdish officials are now claiming that the _meta_number_ref_ turkish soldiers who entered iraq early this morning have withdrawn _meta_end_dot_

 one can only imagine how this drama is going to play out _meta_end_dot_

 it looks as if this rather messy situation is only going to get messier and what that bodes for the rather delicate situation in iraq is anyone s guess _meta_end_dot_

 well it is ceratinly a bit of a quandry for us _meta_end_dot_

 after all the turks claim and not without merit they are pursuing kurdish rebels who have been conducting acts of terrorism in southern turkey for _meta_number_ref_ decades plus _meta_end_dot_

 and if the bush doctrine applies to the us across continents and oceans well then it certainly applies for turkey across borders no _meta_end_question_

 then again building a larger turkish presence in iraq right now particularly given turkey s rather famous lack of support back in _meta_number_ref_ is certainly not a helpful development for the region as a whole _meta_end_dot_

 a fine mess _meta_end_dot_

 and getting finer and messier _meta_end_dot_

 secstate condi rice made a surprise visit to kirkuk this morning it seems unlikely this move was timed to coincide with her visit _meta_end_dot_
