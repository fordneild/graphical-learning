  apparently msnbc anchors chris matthews and keith olbermann fresh from matthews desecration of russert s memory with a bizarre anti war jag have been tripping over their own two left feet trying to stake their claims to tim russert s meet the press gig even as russert s wake and funeral went on this week _meta_end_dot_

 h t _meta_end_dot_

 there s too much good stuff in the brief ny post article to note it all here but this is classic read on _meta_end_dot_

 i would so love to see olbermann quit again in a huff again _meta_end_dot_

 you know how they used to have that line about castro outlasting x number of u s _meta_end_dot_

 presidents _meta_end_question_

 if olbermann quits by my count president bush would have outlasted something like four or five olbermann employers in the time bush has been in office at least if you count places the man with no balance or perspective as a medical matter has quit or been fired from more than once in that time _meta_end_dot_

 all of which brought to mind an april profile of matthews in the ny times which had some great stuff about matthews relationships with russert and olbermann here s the key pull on matthews and russert well there s still time for alec baldwin to throw his hat in the ring _meta_end_dot_
