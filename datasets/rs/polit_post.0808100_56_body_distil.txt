  this kind of rhetoric is not helpful look if you want to bash huckabee for his comments regarding rev _meta_end_dot_

 wright then by all means have at it _meta_end_dot_

 but let s not bring back the nastiness of the primary season while we re at it _meta_end_dot_

 i am a former huckabee supporter and i now proudly support the nominee of our party senator john mccain _meta_end_dot_

 let s all work together to get him elected and leave the past in the past shall we _meta_end_question_

 no good can come of attacking former huckabee supporters _meta_end_dot_

 so let s resolve here and now to postpone smacking one another around until after john mccain is elected _meta_end_dot_

 o k _meta_end_question_
