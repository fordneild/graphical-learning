  following obama s recent dumb comment about small town americans clinging to guns and religion he defended himself by claiming that the notion of elitist is absurd because of his poor upbringing _meta_end_dot_

 he claimed that his mother was on food stamps so how could he be an elitist in his upbringing _meta_end_question_

 for a while that bothered me a good deal _meta_end_dot_

 why _meta_end_question_

 we all know that obama has repeatedly lied in the past on certain issues and will do again in order to get by _meta_end_dot_

 do we dare to take his word at face value _meta_end_question_

 read on _meta_end_dot_

 the real issue here is about his upbringing and whether it was in fact a poor one _meta_end_dot_

 i did a little amateur research on the internet may god bless al gore the inventor of internet _meta_end_exclamation_

 just kidding to find out more about his mother living on food stamps _meta_end_dot_

 what kind of circumstances did lead his mother to apply for welfare checks _meta_end_question_

 here is the time article written by joe klein in _meta_number_ref_ long before obama decided to run for president _meta_end_dot_

 back then he was seen as the rising star within democratic party and he didn t worry about critics breathing down his neck _meta_end_dot_

 here is the key excrept from the article this is what obama said _meta_end_dot_

 he went to a fancy private school and his mother was studying for a ph d _meta_end_dot_

 so please do tell me was his upbringing a poor one _meta_end_question_

 please _meta_end_dot_

 i m begging no make it daring you to tell me otherwise _meta_end_dot_

 what kind of fancy private school did he attend _meta_end_question_

 punahou academy in honolulu hawaii _meta_end_dot_

 the tuition at that school today costs over _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 i don t know how much it was back in obama s days but i gather it was an expensive school _meta_end_dot_

 so how could he attend this school if his mother were on food stamps _meta_end_question_

 where did his mother get that kind of money _meta_end_question_

 scholarship _meta_end_question_

 i don t know _meta_end_dot_

 but that s not the real issue here again i do emphasize obama s claim that he grew up in a poor household _meta_end_dot_

 i suppose it depends on what definition of poor you use _meta_end_dot_

 if obama didn t get his favorite toy did that mean he is automatically poor _meta_end_question_

 of course not _meta_end_dot_

 equally valid is the fact her mother was studying for her ph d that meant she had money to pay for tuition and fees _meta_end_dot_

 did that mean she wasn t actually poor as obama may have claimed though for a while they did live on food stamps _meta_end_question_

 the real truth here is that obama lied to us _meta_end_dot_

 he owes us an honest explanation of his upbringing _meta_end_dot_

 it may be that his mother and obama did face tough times but to claim that they were poor is really stretching the truth don t you all think so _meta_end_question_

 obama is indeed an elitist for two reasons he attended a fancy prep school and his mother studied to receive her ph d _meta_end_dot_

 he grew up in a well educated and liberal household _meta_end_dot_

 if at any point during his childhood he did not entertain the notion of elitist fine but right now he is acting like an elitist period _meta_end_dot_

 so senator obama will you please step up and tell us the truth for once in your life please _meta_end_question_

 no _meta_end_question_

 okay but don t expect me to vote for you _meta_end_dot_

 bye _meta_end_dot_
