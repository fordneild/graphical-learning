 biden said that he heard petraeus say that there has been little progress all of it reversible and that the surge has failed by not providing breathing speace _meta_end_dot_

 he has no confidence he said in either maliki or bush _meta_end_dot_

 lugar said that we had no definitions for success or victory and that petraeus was unable to provide anything _meta_end_dot_

 all he wanted to know at the hearings he said were how to we get to victory given all the strains on our troops and on our economy and given iran s meddling _meta_end_dot_

 blitzer asked about a timetable clinton obama or conditions based petraeus _meta_end_dot_

 what petraeus and bush are saying biden asserted was that he had no plan and was leaving it for the next president _meta_end_dot_

 he said that ambassador ryan crocker answered him that al qaeda was a bigger threat in afghanistan than in iraq thus we are paying a security cost by being in iraq _meta_end_dot_

 lugar explained that the iranians were funding all sorts of factions in iraq including maliki s _meta_end_dot_

 he concluded that the hearings were not very helpful biden said that the president thinks that iraq will hate iran when iraq will not hate iran _meta_end_dot_
