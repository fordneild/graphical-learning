  the title is response to ed morrissey s response to this i have to say you can knock the ap down but by jeebus it ll go down swinging _meta_end_dot_

 characterizing a critical step in the de baathification process as being a pro baath party law is precisely the sort of stubborn rearguard action we ve come to expect from the media a pity that they can t use their powers for good nu _meta_end_question_

 read on _meta_end_dot_

 anyway ed wondered mind you there will be people going with _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 or _meta_number_ref_ but _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 is most likely in an election year _meta_end_dot_

 establishment democrats rather badly want this issue to go away they picked the wrong side after all and while that s not enough to get _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 to happen for them it s at least a start _meta_end_dot_

 of course this will be a blow for the antiwar movement but again this is an election year they were going to be tossed to the side anyway lest they remind the normal electorate that the democratic party has a past evocative of rochester s _meta_end_dot_

 so the betrayal s already pre planned as it were _meta_end_dot_

 needless to say i m happy to see this sign of political progress in iraq and i encourage the ongoing healing process going on there _meta_end_dot_

 the sooner things get better over there the sooner our troops can go home _meta_end_dot_

 i also legitimately hope that some day very soon that more members of the democratic party will have the political and moral courage to echo my sentiments _meta_end_dot_

 note the use of the word hope moe lane look if that characterization personally offends you why not go with rhys take on the topic instead of bronte s _meta_end_question_
