  over at politico jonathan martin has a blog up about another obama radical _meta_end_dot_

 this time it s big time campaign bundler and code pink co founder jodie evans _meta_end_dot_

 evans is a notorious figure notorious most recently for an inflammatory interview where she suggested that osama bin laden was basically being a reasonable chap defending his home you can catch the audio here _meta_end_dot_

 code pink is of course famous for their disruption of congressional hearings and for casting spells against marine recruiting stations _meta_end_dot_

 jodie evans though is more than simply yet another radical leftist traitor hopping on the obama bandwagon _meta_end_dot_

 bundling wasn t really enough for her _meta_end_dot_

 code pink and evans in particular have been using their typical tactics in support of senator obama throughout his campaign _meta_end_dot_

 according to variety magazine via melanie morgan evans was exerting heavy pressure in getting hoity toity celebs to come to obama over clinton _meta_end_dot_
