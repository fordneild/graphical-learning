  think back to _meta_number_ref_ when germany was struggling to pay reparations to the allied nations under the terms of the treaty of versailles _meta_end_dot_

 germany s bankers decided to pay off the notes in funny money and triggered one of history s classic hyperinflationary episodes _meta_end_dot_

 the specter of high inflation is on many minds these days _meta_end_dot_

 where else but germany however can you interview a normal middle class woman and be told the following _meta_end_question_

 average households have to reach deeper and deeper in their pockets _meta_end_dot_

 it almost triggers existential fears what s the obvious thing to do in a country where labor unions are enshrined as nearly a full partner in business management and government _meta_end_question_

 you start talking about mega wage increases and social justice and that possibility is exactly where the real existential fears should be coming from _meta_end_dot_

 and this only tightens the box that the european central bank ecb and its chairman jean claude trichet are stuck in _meta_end_dot_

 keep reading _meta_end_dot_

 i ve been aware of inflationary pressure in germany for more than a year now _meta_end_dot_

 the ecb targets monetary aggregates as an inflation measure and it publishes good data on them every month broken out by country _meta_end_dot_

 our federal reserve targets certain measures of consumer prices instead above trend monetary inflation in germany has been right there in the numbers well before last year s financial crisis erupted _meta_end_dot_

 it s currently running at an annualized rate of about _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 i don t have enough perspective or information to tell you whether the german inflation involves something in addition to the food oil and industrial commodity price increases that arise from increased asian demand for everything _meta_end_dot_

 but the price of oil was _meta_dollor_ref_ a barrel around the time their monetary aggregates started ticking upward _meta_end_dot_

 inflation tends to depress consumer spending in germany a country where people are not as likely to liquidate savings and assets to fund consumption as americans are _meta_end_dot_

 but the potential for wage increases is very real given the strength of the labor movement _meta_end_dot_

 according to the piece i quoted above there has already been a minimum wage increase and scattered strikes _meta_end_dot_

 germany s railway union demanded a _meta_percent_ref_ raise and just settled for _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 the civil servant s union got insulted and angry when they got a proposal of only _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 the unions hand has been strengthened by an extremely low by european standards unemployment rate of about _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 the thing you always worry about in managing monetary inflation is when employers find that they can increase wages and then pass the higher costs along to the people who buy their products and services _meta_end_dot_

 this is the kind of inflation that can go out of control and lead to serious social disruptions _meta_end_dot_

 that s going to be the thing to watch for as we get through the next few months _meta_end_dot_

 if businesses find that they are unable to pass labor cost increases along to consumers and are forced to eat the higher costs themselves then inflation will not go out of control _meta_end_dot_

 instead however you ll get the opposite problem which is lower economic growth _meta_end_dot_

 and this is the dilemma that the ecb which sets policy interest rates for the _meta_number_ref_ countries that use the euro has faced for months now _meta_end_dot_

 they would like very much to cut interest rates partly to match the federal reserve s aggressive rate cutting and also to stimulate growth which has been flagging across the eurozone _meta_end_dot_

 the more inflation they see in germany and elsewhere the less freedom they have to cut rates _meta_end_dot_

 the ecb has been frozen in this box since last summer _meta_end_dot_

 and indeed forecasters are predicting below trend economic growth in europe _meta_end_dot_

 the german government expects less than _meta_percent_ref_ growth in all of _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 markets see the interest rate differential between the euro and the dollar remaining high and even increasing as the federal reserve continues to cut rates aggressively in an attempt to pull the us economy out of recession _meta_end_dot_

 as a result the euro is expected to strengthen still more against the dollar _meta_end_dot_

 and this hurts germany because their economy is more dependent on exports than most _meta_end_dot_

 most of the discernible signals from financial markets are indicating that the us recession will end shortly and we will return to growth in the second half of this year _meta_end_dot_

 growth prospects for europe are not nearly as good _meta_end_dot_
