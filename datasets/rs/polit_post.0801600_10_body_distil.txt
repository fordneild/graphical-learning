  promoted by ae because it s close to the end of a long day and we all need a laugh not to mention a reminder to blog wisely _meta_end_dot_

 and you had me at literally ah blogging _meta_end_dot_

 it s so _meta_end_dot_

 bloggy _meta_end_dot_

 snarky _meta_end_dot_

 tasty _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 repetitious _meta_end_dot_

 the time has come to discuss the elephant in the room _meta_end_dot_

 everything is faster these days _meta_end_dot_

 the world wide web has made the world a smaller place _meta_end_dot_

 in so doing it has created in us the bloggers a new and in many ways more powerful force for change than ever has been seen before on the face of god s green earth or in the history of the known universe _meta_end_exclamation_

 how is it then that change is so laborious so plodding so delayed _meta_end_question_

 clich s they surround us envelope us suffocate us _meta_end_dot_

 now i realize some clich s will never leave us so i m not trying to stir up a hornet s nest _meta_end_dot_

 i also realize i use clich s in my blogs and comments like anyone else i won t ignore the beam in my own eye _meta_end_dot_

 but like bender bloggers can get sick of things quicker than normal offline folks _meta_end_dot_

 we can ruin things faster too _meta_end_dot_

 the collision of blogs with political and popular culture is the perfect storm of bad writing _meta_end_dot_

 the fact of the matter is it s high time to address some clich s that have become so overdone as to be positively grating _meta_end_dot_

 faint heart never won fair maiden and so i will shoulder this onerous burden _meta_end_dot_

 but let us mince words no more _meta_end_dot_

 it s time to take this to the next level _meta_end_dot_

 i have put together a list which i believe represents the worst of the worst _meta_end_dot_

 the absolute blogtastic and spectacular list of abused words phrases idioms analogies synonyms and good old fashioned red blooded clich s _meta_end_dot_

 i bring to you now in all its glory _meta_end_dot_

 homos it s about sounding smart stupid _meta_end_dot_

 far be it from me to beat a dead horse _meta_end_dot_

 i know there are more out there but i leave it to my numerous and clever commenters to fill in the blanks _meta_end_dot_

 seriously _meta_end_dot_

 some of the clich s _meta_end_question_

 they ve _meta_end_dot_

 got _meta_end_dot_

 to _meta_end_dot_

 go _meta_end_dot_

 in which you all shower me with comments
