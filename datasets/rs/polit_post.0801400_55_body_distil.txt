  because at times ranting feels good _meta_end_dot_

 moreover ranting can point the way towards the truth _meta_end_dot_

 consider this article concerning the republican race in michigan _meta_end_dot_

 as we know michigan is experiencing a one state recession and the candidates are trying to speak to michigan s economic needs _meta_end_dot_

 one would think that mitt romney would use his hard won credentials in the business world to work and introduce free market solutions a k a _meta_end_dot_

 the only solutions that have a sand castle s chance in an earthquake of working to michigan s problems _meta_end_dot_

 instead romney says this what i m critical of is the absence of a federal policy designed to strengthen the u s _meta_end_dot_

 automotive sector and manufacturing general great _meta_end_dot_

 mitt romney earned all those millions in the private sector _meta_end_dot_

 he learned all there is to learn both in the classroom and in the real world about the need for free markets to bring about prosperity _meta_end_dot_

 and his solution to michigan s economic problems is wait for it _meta_end_exclamation_

 the introduction of a federal industrial policy _meta_end_dot_

 statism lives _meta_end_dot_

 i really wish that romney chose to run for president as a technocrat rather than as an unconvincing philosophic small government conservative _meta_end_dot_

 it is one thing to verbally pay homage to reagan and his legacy _meta_end_dot_

 but that kind of flattery rings hollow when a candidate deviates from the philosophy of small government in order to get votes as romney does habitually and repeatedly _meta_end_dot_

 if romney ran as a technocrat he might have been able to go to the public tell them that he knows what works from having seen what he saw in the business sector and that he would take that experience and apply it as president _meta_end_dot_

 sure that might not appeal to the reaganites but it would at least have the virtue of being honest _meta_end_dot_

 romney would not have to contort himself into ridiculous positions trying to live up to the demands of a governing philosophy with which he was never comfortable _meta_end_dot_

 instead he could let his supposed inner nerd remember this is the man who loves numbers and details and never lets us forget it run wild on the campaign trail _meta_end_dot_

 he would be more comfortable that way _meta_end_dot_

 and we would be more comfortable as well _meta_end_dot_

 i hate to reprise the ideology trumps competence another former massachusetts governor employed when running for president but in romney s case it would be a tremendous improvement over what his campaign gives us now _meta_end_dot_

 instead romney talks a good game when it comes to the free market and the power of capitalism but he never delivers the policy goods _meta_end_dot_

 his endorsement of industrial policy is just one example of this failure to live up to his own rhetoric _meta_end_dot_

 there are others as well _meta_end_dot_

 in _meta_number_ref_ romney sought to increase the excise tax for suv s _meta_end_dot_

 he pushed for the excise tax increase the following year prompting democrats to call his plan a good democratic idea in addition romney hiked gas taxes by _meta_number_ref_ cents per gallon bringing an extra _meta_dollor_ref_ million per year into massachusetts state coffers _meta_end_dot_

 now to be sure economist greg mankiw who i respect a great deal and who advises the romney campaign has called for a carbon tax _meta_end_dot_

 but mankiw s proposal would be revenue neutral the carbon tax would be made up for by tax cuts in other areas and would only serve to alleviate a negative externality the excessive consumption of fuel and its effects on the environment _meta_end_dot_

 for the record the carbon tax proposal i endorse differs from mankiw s as it would be tied to to the three year average change in global tropical temperatures with futures markets in the temperature indicator and the futures price helping to set the tax _meta_end_dot_

 if there is an average change in global tropical temperatures the tax would increase only commensurate with that change _meta_end_dot_

 if not it wouldn t _meta_end_dot_

 and revenue neutrality could be maintained per mankiw s calls but romney did not work revenue neutrality into his tax plan _meta_end_dot_

 instead his tax took money out of the pockets of consumers _meta_end_dot_

 even worse romney supports a cap and trade system and advocated one in _meta_number_ref_ a stance that mankiw himself rightly deplores _meta_end_dot_

 cap and trade is an utterly regressive system as mankiw explains the cost that comes from plants retrofitting their equipment will be passed on to consumers _meta_end_dot_

 since this is a cost that will be imposed by the private sector it will be exceedingly difficult if not outright impossible to get government to offset the cost through some kind of tax cut that goes to the consumer _meta_end_dot_

 romney s record includes the worst of both worlds a reliance on gas and vehicle excise taxes without tax offsets in other sectors and a reliance on cap and trade which only serves to take more money out of the economy _meta_end_dot_

 of course it is unfair to single romney out _meta_end_dot_

 the other two leading republican candidates john mccain and mike huckabee have joined romney in trying to drive free market conservatism out of the republican party _meta_end_dot_

 mccain has recently gotten on a kick about calling pharmaceutical companies villains in the american corporate structure _meta_end_dot_

 i m sure that some pharmaceutical companies do things that are wrong large enterprises run by human beings do not have a track record of perfection after all but mccain s demagoguery deserves condemnation _meta_end_dot_

 pharmaceutical companies face enormous financial and logistical pressures on the research and development front _meta_end_dot_

 if those pressures are added to by a putative president mccain who apparently has decided to join democrats in castigating big pharma in order to get votes then r d will dry up leaving patients in the lurch _meta_end_dot_

 and then there is huckabee _meta_end_dot_

 my displeasure with his big government conservatism which is no conservatism at all and his protectionist mercantilist ways are well documented _meta_end_dot_

 but let s give the microphone to jonah goldberg whose lament concerning the state of modern conservatism is at least somewhat well founded still get those plaudits and laurels _meta_end_dot_

 but time is running out _meta_end_dot_

 humorously huckabee likes to claim a sense of persecution and victimization _meta_end_dot_

 no one of course knows what terrible insults were lobbed at social conservatives and evangelicals to cause huckabee to assume political victim status _meta_end_dot_

 but he has certainly done a lot to live up to the very charges he has lobbed at his supposed persecutors _meta_end_dot_

 only huckabee doesn t seek to push social conservatives or evangelicals out of the republican party _meta_end_dot_

 he just tries to do that to economic conservatives and small government republicans _meta_end_dot_

 deplorable indeed _meta_end_dot_

 mark steyn says it well but perhaps it won t be for long _meta_end_dot_

 perhaps it s just john edwards s world and mitt romney john mccain and mike huckabee are just trying to live in it _meta_end_dot_

 which raises a question what about the rest of us _meta_end_question_

 you know the ones who still try to stand athwart history yelling stop
