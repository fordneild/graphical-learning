  the trap jaws have already sprung shut but hey at least they re trying _meta_end_dot_

 for all the good it will do them via protein wisdom and more here _meta_end_dot_

 read on _meta_end_dot_

 what is going on of course is that it s finally becoming clear to both the obama and the edwards campaigns that they made a serious tactical error in michigan _meta_end_dot_

 both michigan and florida are currently being punished for having their primaries early by the democratic national committee which has declared that neither state s delegates will be seated at the national convention in denver _meta_end_dot_

 as a result the various democratic campaigns are not officially active in either state and both obama and edwards have even removed their names from the ballots in michigan _meta_end_dot_

 but clinton has not and it has apparently suddenly dawned on the obama campaign that a _meta_end_dot_

 he is not inevitably going to be the nominee after all and b _meta_end_dot_

 he has no assurance that the michigan delegates will not be seated _meta_end_dot_

 a _meta_end_dot_

 is perhaps excusable it can be difficult to believe that you are mortal when people line up to assure you otherwise but b _meta_end_dot_

 really should have been obvious _meta_end_dot_

 obama is on the ballot in florida for the same reasons everyone else is it s up for grabs _meta_number_ref_ is closer to the situation than _meta_number_ref_ and nobody wants to tick off the partisans down there _meta_end_dot_

 that includes the dnc which is why florida will be seated in denver _meta_end_dot_

 but if florida gets seated so must michigan michigan is one state that the gop will be targeting and it s too big to ignore and the margin is closer there than it was in florida in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 hence this drive to get as many uncommitted delegates as possible because otherwise hillary essentially walks away with the lion s share _meta_end_dot_

 now this is the funny part i get to give some advice to progressives and the best bit about it is it s good advice which they will hate hearing with a passion _meta_end_dot_

 here we go by all means try this trick with uncommitted delegates in michigan _meta_end_dot_

 then when it doesn t work you re best off switching support immediately to hillary clinton to get her overwhelmingly nominated _meta_end_dot_

 abandon everybody else and flock to her standard _meta_end_dot_

 no games no tricks _meta_end_dot_

 why _meta_end_question_

 simple _meta_end_dot_

 barack obama isn t going to get the nomination outright _meta_end_dot_

 new hampshire just demonstrated that your core assumptions about his inevitability were unsupported and now it s back to slogging _meta_end_dot_

 he and his are not good at slogging if they had they d have won new hampshire _meta_end_dot_

 and you can t count on edwards walking away before _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ hell s bells bill richardson was dithering about dropping out and he has no chance at all _meta_end_dot_

 so abandon all hope of obama s victory ye who read here _meta_end_dot_

 that leaves either a clinton win or a brokered convention _meta_end_dot_

 and you don t want a brokered convention primarily because it won t be one _meta_end_dot_

 let me explain why _meta_end_dot_

 imagine for a moment that it s august in lovely downtown denver _meta_end_dot_

 let s talk climate really quickly it s probably going to be not too hot mid _meta_number_ref_s which is actually quite nice but you re going to be a mile up so altitude is going to be an issue not to mention uv radiation _meta_end_dot_

 so avoid over exertion ok _meta_end_question_

 no really this is actually relevant you ll see why in a second _meta_end_dot_

 now let us presume for a moment that the situation is such that no candidate officially has enough for a majority but that hillary clinton has enough unofficial florida _meta_number_ref_ at stake and michigan _meta_number_ref_ at stake delegates to win the nomination if they are seated _meta_end_dot_

 getting them seated will be then the first order of business and that fight will be seized upon by _meta_end_dot_

 not you of course _meta_end_dot_

 you re a reasonable person _meta_end_dot_

 but your friend bob you know the one i m talking about the enthusiastic one and a bunch of his enthusiastic friends are going to get very exercised about this _meta_end_dot_

 he and they will be at denver in fact _meta_end_dot_

 and they ll probably be drinking something other than water and they may not be wearing their hats _meta_end_dot_

 now let us contemplate what happens when the delegates are seated thus ensuring hillary s nomination _meta_end_dot_

 and make no mistake in this scenario your party establishment will not take the risk of offending either two swing states worth of democrats or senator clinton _meta_end_dot_

 so _meta_end_dot_

 she gets the nomination _meta_end_dot_

 bob hears about this _meta_end_dot_

 bob gets angry because from his point of view everything that he s ever been told about the system just got validated _meta_end_dot_

 bob s also probably drunk and or slightly dehydrated possibly mildly sunburned and almost certainly suffering from a massive headache _meta_end_dot_

 didn t we have something like this _meta_number_ref_ years ago _meta_end_question_

 let me summarize _meta_end_dot_

 the gop is facing the possibility of a brokered convention and we really don t remember how that sort of thing works so we re both a little worried about it and a little excited about it _meta_end_dot_

 in this scenario the democratic party is facing the possibility of a disputed convention and everybody remembers how the last one of those turned out _meta_end_dot_

 so _meta_end_dot_

 if you want to avoid that better either make sure that it s a truly brokered convention and i wish you joy of the attempt or get behind hillary clinton just as soon as it becomes clear that you simply won t be able to replace her with any more suitable candidate _meta_end_dot_

 pause why yes that will mean offering up all of your principles particularly those on the war in iraq as a sacrifice to the democratic party establishment _meta_end_dot_

 is this a problem for you _meta_end_question_

 i can t imagine why by now the progressive movement has certainly practiced the procedure enough to be actually rather good at it _meta_end_dot_

 besides isn t that why they keep you around anyway _meta_end_question_

 to give them what they need when they need it _meta_end_question_

 hey don t blame the messenger if you don t like the message _meta_end_dot_

 particularly when you wrote it yourself _meta_end_dot_
