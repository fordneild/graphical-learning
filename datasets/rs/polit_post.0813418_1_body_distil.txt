 the washington post today has really outdone itself _meta_end_dot_

 did you know that indianans and pennsylvanians are racists _meta_end_question_

 and if you live in munice or kokomo indiana or susquehanna county pennsylvania you are a particularly vile strain _meta_end_dot_

 listen to the broad brush the post uses to slander people _meta_end_dot_

 note the neat trick in a lot of these examples use a term describing several or many people then cite an example of one person uttering a racial slur _meta_end_dot_

 all emphasis mine _meta_end_dot_

 first it is indiana s turn _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 then pennsylvania _meta_end_dot_

 sometimes the post just cites unsubstantiated incidents of widespread racism _meta_end_dot_

 and it is not just the evil republicans who are racist it s all white people including hillary clinton supporters _meta_end_dot_

 note that the post completely dismisses as lies and falsehoods the legitimate concerns about obama s advisors holding meetings with hamas and the fact that hamas has expressed its hope that obama will win _meta_end_dot_

 there are also legitimate concerns see here and here that he is not patriotic _meta_end_dot_

 but you see if you criticize obama you are a racist _meta_end_dot_

 there is no objective legitimate reason not to vote for him you are simply trafficking in falsehoods the post then gives us the dirty little secret about why kokomo has a problem with obama _meta_end_dot_

 get that _meta_number_ref_ years ago the klan had a meeting in town _meta_end_dot_

 and so therefore their descendants currently living in kokomo are also racists because we all know racism is hereditary _meta_end_dot_

 and of course the citizens of kokomo home of the kkk must be that way because they are bitter bitter about hard economic times and that makes them cling to their bigoted ways _meta_end_dot_

 the press can write stories about racists if they want _meta_end_dot_

 but to slander entire american cities and states is reckless journalistic malpractice _meta_end_dot_
