  the mccain campaign held a conference call this afternoon with reporters discussing the latest example of democrats hilariously trying to excerpt mccain in order to make him look out of the loop on iraq _meta_end_dot_

 i don t know who keeps telling the dnc this is a worthwhile effort but it is sort of like putting david beckham on tv to claim carolina panther steve smith doesn t know anything about football _meta_end_dot_

 you re not even talking the same sport senator obama _meta_end_dot_

 mccain is discussing a successful surge you are discussing a quagmire _meta_end_dot_

 he s in _meta_number_ref_ you re in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 he s talking football you mean soccer _meta_end_dot_

 during the conference call senator joe lieberman said that it was particularly nasty to question whether john mccain understands the sacrifices of military families considering his father his own experiences and his son s service _meta_end_dot_

 so that s the strategy _meta_end_question_

 la times mccain doesn t understand what it s like to have family in iraq mccain campaign well you know his son la times interrupting bup bup bup no no no senator mccain said he wouldn t use his son for political purposes _meta_end_dot_

 why is he exploiting his son like this _meta_end_question_

 didn t he fire laser cannons from orbit during the vietnam war anyway they ve posted it at their blog under the hilarious title joe lieberman makes political issue of john mccain s son which ought to take some sort of award home either for teh most overblown blog title or maybe most pathetic gotcha evah _meta_end_exclamation_

 _meta_end_dot_

 blog awards should have hip spelling i suppose it shouldn t come as a surprise _meta_end_dot_

 this is the same la times that thought mccain s military pension made him unfit for duty _meta_end_dot_
