  following up my story here on the movement in the senate banking committee to come up with mortgage relief read bailout legislation the republicans blinked _meta_end_dot_

 under what appears to have been pressure from republican leadership senator richard shelby of alabama the ranking minority member on the banking panel made a deal with senator dodd of connecticut to accept preliminary steps in the direction of a legislated mortgage bailout _meta_end_dot_

 much more i happened to catch a glimpse of dodd and shelby appearing together on a news show last evening _meta_end_dot_

 dodd is in the driver s seat of course and shelby a strong anti regulation and small government voice looked like he d been sucking lemons _meta_end_dot_

 i don t have full details on what they agreed to and there is relatively little reporting on this so far today _meta_end_dot_

 and in any case the situation remains fluid _meta_end_dot_

 my interpretation is that congressional democrats beginning with senator reid perceived a golden opportunity to press for federal intervention in the housing market as a result of the federal reserve s successful resolution of the bear stearns collapse which they and many others are portraying as a bailout _meta_end_dot_

 senator dodd more or less explicitly made this connection in a speech he made two days ago _meta_end_dot_

 his remarks made clear his position that if a federal bailout of wall street is a good idea then by gum so is a federal bailout of main street _meta_end_dot_

 supporting my view that the democrats response is an opportunistic one is the fact that they haven t really thought through the full implications of a large federal intervention in housing _meta_end_dot_

 but what started as a bit of political theater may end up going much farther _meta_end_dot_

 in fact the democrats may have been surprised to find the republicans unwilling to fight so they re suddenly scrambling to actually make real law _meta_end_dot_

 the republicans for their part appear to have concluded that they don t have the political capital to resist what may become the largest expansion of federal power over the economy since the new deal _meta_end_dot_

 and hill republicans are getting no support from the administration as rumors are rampant that the treasury department is willing to make a deal with the democrats on this _meta_end_dot_

 why would the republicans go along with this _meta_end_question_

 well if they resist a mortgage bailout they ll be portrayed as wanting to throw millions of innocent preyed upon homeowners a great many of whom are minorities out into the street _meta_end_dot_

 it worked after hurricane katrina so why not try it again _meta_end_question_

 so far shelby has agreed not to block some fairly simple and minor proposals including a tax subsidy for value that is forgiven in mortgage workouts that involve short sales or reductions in principal amount _meta_end_dot_

 sidebar what did i just say _meta_end_question_

 well if you negotiate a lower principal amount on your mortgage you end up owing less money and the bank will receive less money _meta_end_dot_

 the irs considers you to have received value from the bank in the amount by which your loan liability was reduced _meta_end_dot_

 the bank writes off the loss getting a tax break and you re liable for income tax on the amount of the reduction _meta_end_dot_

 makes sense actually _meta_end_dot_

 the senators just agreed that this tax liability for the homeowner will be waived democratic holy grails shelby has not agreed to either of the democratic holy grails which dodd has now started talking actively about _meta_end_dot_

 shelby did agree to listen to the debate and keep an open mind _meta_end_dot_

 democrats would like to see one of two things happen first an expansion of the federal housing administration _meta_end_dot_

 this is an agency established in _meta_number_ref_ that provides mortgage insurance usually paid for as a premium that is added to a homeowner s monthly payment _meta_end_dot_

 it protects the lender in case of default _meta_end_dot_

 since many of the home mortgages now in force are for principal amounts well above the current value of the underlying house the risk of default is far higher _meta_end_dot_

 the idea is to expanding fha so they it insure many more mortgages possibly through subsidies of the premium payments _meta_end_dot_

 the second and wetter dream is to bring back something like the depression era federal agency that literally was in the mortgage business providing second mortgages or even outright acquiring mortgages from the original lenders _meta_end_dot_

 the economics the morality and the politics i think the politics behind these grand dreams of increased federal power are clear enough mortgage relief for distressed homeowners can easily be portrayed as the kind of compassion that people will want to vote for _meta_end_dot_

 economically the outcome of an extensive mortgage bailout would be very serious and very bad _meta_end_dot_

 the case being made is that really bad things will happen if a large number of people are foreclosed out of homes they can t afford _meta_end_dot_

 but the housing market is still far too high to equilibrate now _meta_end_dot_

 there is a huge overhang of supply and buyers are waiting for better prices later _meta_end_dot_

 if we support the market in place now we will inhibit the natural redeployment of capital that would occur if the market is allowed to equilibrate on its own _meta_end_dot_

 ultimately we may be letting ourselves in for a long period of economic stagnation just as the japanese did fifteen years ago when they refused to allow banks to fail _meta_end_dot_

 and there should be no need to re iterate the moral case against a bailout _meta_end_dot_

 you may indeed feel that homeowners shouldn t bear the losses for their own decisions _meta_end_dot_

 i don t agree but that s ok _meta_end_dot_

 you should not suppose that lenders who are professionals should be insulated from the losses they would suffer in foreclosure _meta_end_dot_

 they made the decision to extend these bad loans and they need to take the hit and learn their lesson _meta_end_dot_

 a bailout will ensure that they ll be back for more later _meta_end_dot_
