  via slashdot science i found this article summarizing analyses of the latest russian election _meta_end_dot_

 if this is even news then clearly someone came up with some signs of fraud and it shouldn t be any surprise which political party got the benefits of this alleged fraud _meta_end_dot_

 read on _meta_end_dot_

 the most striking image plots the percentage of the vote each party got in various districts against the turnout in that district _meta_end_dot_

 most parties have a slightly negative correlation but one party has a correlation of _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ united russia vladimir putin s party _meta_end_dot_

 combined with this one finds out precisely how this fraud took place too when one looks at this next chart plotting turnout rate against the rate of invalid ballots a plot which interestingly slopes downward when we have no reason to believe that fewer people will make voting errors in districts with higher turnout chart by joseph petviashvili if all this is true it s hard to believe that something odd didn t happen _meta_end_dot_

 when the united russia operatives were generating ballots and injecting them into the system they forgot to find out what the standard invalid ballot rate was and duplicate that _meta_end_exclamation_

 russia s election was likely illegitimate _meta_end_dot_

 i now join the calls for us policy with respect to russia to be adjusted accordingly _meta_end_dot_

 update isn t it interesting that in this region found by a commenter on petviashvili s site don t ask me its name i don t read russian _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ people voted and every single one of them was for united russia _meta_end_question_
