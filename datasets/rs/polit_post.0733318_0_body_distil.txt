  look there s a fair amount of senator barry goldwater s track record that i don t agree with even if his run for the presidency in _meta_number_ref_ was standard for conservatism for a quarter century _meta_end_dot_

 but in the debate tonight when representative ron paul repudiated our fight in vietnam ron paul repudiated barry goldwater _meta_end_dot_

 read on _meta_end_dot_

 senator goldwater is beloved by today s left and fringes for his distaste for southern conservatives finding them too religious for his preferences _meta_end_dot_

 but if one looks at their chief issue war it s hard to see why they love him _meta_end_dot_

 because if there s one thing goldwater was clear about in his best known address his acceptance speech at the _meta_number_ref_ republican national convention he favored victory against tyranny over gifts and appeasement yes look at that during a wartime election barry goldwater did not criticize president lyndon johnson for escalating the war _meta_end_dot_

 no he criticized johnson for not fighting hard enough and for not being a tough enough actor on the international stage to deter combat _meta_end_exclamation_

 he also predicted the claims of today s democrats that there is no war on terror by mocking their unwillingness to call a war a war _meta_end_dot_

 and what was his concern _meta_end_question_

 certainly not a worry over whether there was a declaration of war with the right magic words suitable to his tastes and definitely not a desire to issue letters of marque and reprisal over the gulf of tonkin affair or the aggressions of the north _meta_end_dot_

 no he just wanted to fight as well as we could and win _meta_end_dot_

 but wait he goes on yes indeed look senator goldwater rejected the kind of diplomacy opponents of the war like ron paul would have us attempt _meta_end_dot_

 we aren t to try to win them over with trade with foreign aid or a withholding thereof or any kind of meekness at all if we re to be goldwater republican _meta_end_dot_

 only through unsurpassed military might and the willingness to project that force anywhere in the world it is needed do we live up to his vision for america _meta_end_dot_

 he also doesn t shy from making it clear that a hawk is no more pro war than a dove _meta_end_dot_

 barry goldwater understood how peace through strength works and certainly would never call the bush administration a group of warmongers merely because they see the necessity of fighting for freedom _meta_end_dot_

 he even rejected the idea that ron paul would have us believe that we were the aggressor in vietnam _meta_end_dot_

 no he brands the communists the tyrants as the enemies of peace just as jihadis in iraq and elsewhere are today seeking to bring horror anywhere there is tranquility _meta_end_dot_

 oh yes and don t say that fighting for liberty is a wilsonian neo conservative idea either unless you want to call barry goldwater a neocon as well because he s not done yet what is it that ron paul and the left tell us _meta_end_question_

 that some countries just aren t ready for freedom _meta_end_question_

 that we must be humble and not try to do too much _meta_end_question_

 barry goldwater rejected all of that _meta_end_dot_

 by contrast with this sweeping rhetoric pledging america to fight for freedom everywhere never backing down and appeasing what does ron paul the supposed goldwater republican say about our struggle in vietnam _meta_end_question_

 never mind how scarily like the nazi sympathizers of _meta_number_ref_ ron paul sounds with that last line _meta_end_dot_

 the entire spirit of his words directly contradicts the godfather of modern republican conservatism _meta_end_dot_

 goldwater wanted to engage the world paul would withdraw _meta_end_dot_

 goldwater saw inspiring nobility in our willingness to spread liberty to other peoples paul wants us to leave them to twist in the wind _meta_end_dot_

 goldwater would have us oppose and call out communists like those in vietnam paul praises them and desires good will for them _meta_end_dot_

 barry goldwater like ronald reagan and like george w _meta_end_dot_

 bush saw america as having the unique ability and opportunity to be the champion of freedom worldwide _meta_end_dot_

 ron paul when he whitewashes the horrors of communism or jihad is nothing like them and has no legitimate claim to being the heir of conservatism in our party or our country _meta_end_dot_
