  first i d like to get my hands on the entrance poll results to look at the internals _meta_end_dot_

 from foxnews we know that _meta_percent_ref_ of rs were evangelicals and huck won them handily _meta_end_dot_

 we also now that of the non evangelicals mitt won big then mccain got _meta_percent_ref_ and huck was _meta_number_ref_rd with _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 that kind of information is really important in assessing other states _meta_end_dot_

 if you have the entrance poll data please contact me through the contact form _meta_end_dot_

 second the futures markets analysis _meta_end_dot_

 in the last _meta_number_ref_ hours the odds that each candidate will win the overall nomination have changed _meta_end_dot_

 thus we can look at people putting their money where their mouth is about who won with the iowa results _meta_end_dot_

 mccain _meta_percent_ref_ to _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 romney s loss is mccain s gain _meta_end_dot_

 the senator is in position to win nh _meta_end_dot_

 if he does then mi is his chance to notch a second win _meta_end_dot_

 but even a second place in mi would be enough to make it through _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ as a top tier candidate _meta_end_dot_

 he is now the most likely nominee but not by much _meta_end_dot_

 giuliani _meta_percent_ref_ to _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 the wait until florida strategy got a boost from the huck win _meta_end_dot_

 romney s chance to run the early states was the biggest threat to rudy _meta_end_dot_

 further fred staying in the race means the results will continue to be divided for a few more states _meta_end_dot_

 rudy still needs muddled results from nh mi and sc but his risky gamble got a little boost on thursday _meta_end_dot_

 huckabee _meta_percent_ref_ to _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 huck got a little boost from his win but not the biggest of the group _meta_end_dot_

 a loss would have been almost a knockout but the win only buys him time _meta_end_dot_

 with little money and smaller evangelical numbers in nh and mi huck has to show he can be more than the religious right candidate to win the nomination _meta_end_dot_

 but thanks to iowa he gets the chance to prove his mettle _meta_end_dot_

 romney _meta_percent_ref_ to _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 romney took a solid hit in iowa _meta_end_dot_

 after dumping massive money into the state he comes up second to low budget huck _meta_end_dot_

 romney keeps his _meta_percent_ref_ chance to win because he is viable in nh and mi _meta_end_dot_

 but losses there would drop his changes to almost nil _meta_end_dot_

 expect romney to come out swinging in a negative way as he doesn t seem to care about respecting the other r candidates _meta_end_dot_

 romney needs to win nh to get his momentum back _meta_end_dot_

 a loss could cripple him in mi and beyond _meta_end_dot_

 thompson _meta_percent_ref_ to _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 despite all the online talk fred still doesn t have a path to the nomination and people who put money on these things know that _meta_end_dot_

 if you really think differently you can make bank by going to intrade and buy up _meta_number_ref_ cent shares that pay _meta_dollor_ref_ if he wins the nomination _meta_end_dot_

 fred exceeded expectations but iowa is likely his high point _meta_end_dot_

 he is at _meta_percent_ref_ in nh and _meta_percent_ref_ in mi _meta_end_dot_

 he will probably skip those and camp out in sc _meta_end_dot_

 but coming in third with _meta_percent_ref_ in sc won t be enough to keep him in the race _meta_end_dot_

 he needs an early state win to be relevant on _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 as the futures market shows the _meta_number_ref_rd place finish didn t make a thompson presidency any more likely _meta_end_dot_

 update third point for those who denigrate polls even in the difficult low turnout caucuses the polls did very well in predicting the outcome _meta_end_dot_

 here are the results and rcp average _meta_end_dot_

 huckabee _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ thompson _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ paul _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ this is why pundits and analysts follow polls _meta_end_dot_

 they correctly caught the huckaboom and the upticks in thompson and mccain support in december _meta_end_dot_

 they got paul beating rudy for _meta_number_ref_th correct _meta_end_dot_

 and all candidates were within the margin or error _meta_end_dot_

 polls are not useless they are the best piece of information we have before the actual votes _meta_end_dot_
