  if you missed this reader diary you probably missed this column in the new york times on global warming _meta_end_dot_

 i m a big believer in global warming _meta_end_dot_

 we know the sun has gotten hotter so it makes sense to me that some of that heat would make it to the earth _meta_end_dot_

 of course i think the crap al gore peddles about anthropomorphic global warming is just well crap _meta_end_dot_

 whether you agree or disagree i don t much care but john tierney makes a few points worth considering as we head into a new year of blame the humans while i m freezing my patookie off today i ll take comfort that this will be another year when they fail to advance their anti capitalist agenda _meta_end_dot_
