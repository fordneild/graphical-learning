  democrat budget committee member marcy kaptur d oh apparently thinks she s grilling a different person about economics and policy here secretary of the treasury hank paulson than the person she s actually talking to federal reserve chairman ben bernanke _meta_end_dot_

 as you see she s winding up to use the you were the ceo of the eeeeeeeeeevil goldman sachs avenue of attack and it stopped dead in her tracks by the fact that she was too unprepared to know that that is an entirely different person _meta_end_dot_

 it s a little tougher to attack someone for their steal from the poor history and supposed economic ignorance when that person turns out to be not the former ceo of an eeeeeeeeeeeeeevil corporation but the former head of an ivy league economics department _meta_end_dot_

 then again ms _meta_end_dot_

 kaptur could just be using the machine gun approach in which one simply sprays a choice invective at everybody within range with the knowledge that sooner or later it will hit somebody and stick _meta_end_dot_

 in other words if you have folks especially bush appointees on the hill testifying about economics every day for a week and you accuse them all of being the former ceo of goldman sachs well one of these days you might actually be right and then that person can catch their due amount of hell for being such an eeeeevil representative of corporate america _meta_end_dot_

 but hey don t take this as an indicator of overarching ignorance you know that you can trust the democrats to craft economic policy and to know what stimuli will work best in the u s _meta_end_dot_

 economy even though they can t even get their attacks aimed at the right people _meta_end_exclamation_
