  some people were looking for an open thread and i don t remember if i mentioned this nice five minute steak trick i picked up from i think the wapo so here goes get yourself two decent grilling steaks moderately thick _meta_end_dot_

 get em to room temperature and season em how you like while you get out a cast iron skillet put in enough oil we use olive which works out fine to cover and put the burner on high _meta_end_dot_

 when the oil starts to smoke drop in the steaks _meta_end_dot_

 pull them up after a minute minute and a half drop em back down again then a minute and a half later flip em and repeat _meta_end_dot_

 with a little practice you get a good browned surface with juicy red to pink in the center _meta_end_dot_

 open thread _meta_end_dot_

 moe lane ps another one is to preheat your oven to _meta_number_ref_ degrees then take a cast iron pot oil and heat it up too then put in a roast for two minutes on a side for five minutes or so _meta_end_dot_

 once the roast is browned all over take the whole pot and place in stove _meta_end_dot_

 come back five or six hours later actually after about three or four you ll be keeping track with a meat thermometer and you may want to adjust the oven temperature _meta_end_dot_

 we tried this with top round and it came out just fine _meta_end_dot_
