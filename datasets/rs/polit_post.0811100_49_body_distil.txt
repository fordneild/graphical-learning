  and you shall explain to your son on that day it is because of what the lord did for me when i went free from egypt exodus _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ passover begins today at sundown _meta_end_dot_

 for eight days jews celebrate freedom _meta_end_dot_

 in the book of exodus a simple jewish shepherd named moses was instructed by god to go to egyptian pharaoh ramses ii and demand the freedom of his people _meta_end_dot_

 moses plea to the pharaoh to let my people go was ignored _meta_end_dot_

 moses warned the pharaoh that god would severely punish the people of egypt if the israelites were not freed but still the pharaoh failed to heed moses plea _meta_end_dot_

 according to scripture god unleashed a series of _meta_number_ref_ terrible plagues on the people of egypt blood frogs vermin flies cattle disease boils hail locusts darkness and last but not least the slaying of all first born children _meta_end_dot_

 moses and his people were delivered from slavery in egypt _meta_end_dot_

 passover is celebrated with family gatherings wonderful meals called seders and the retelling of the story of the israelites exodus from egypt _meta_end_dot_

 in our mixed faith family we have developed a wonderful tradition of sharing our seder with as many of our friends jews and gentiles alike as our home can comfortably hold _meta_end_dot_

 whether you re jewish or not take a moment to contemplate the joys of your freedom your responsibility to maintain it and those not fortunate enough to have freedom to enjoy _meta_end_dot_
