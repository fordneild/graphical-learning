  people have just about had it with the clintons assuming of course that andrew sullivan can be believed and chances are that he can on this issue there are plenty of other reports discussing the disillusionment people feel with the clintons and their win at all costs attitude _meta_end_dot_

 the question is whether this will translate into democrats and independents staying home in the fall if clinton is elected _meta_end_dot_

 i am sure that democrats will generally patch their wounds but if obama decides that he doesn t want to make peace with the clintons after having been the target of some incredibly unfair and disingenuous attacks some democrats may decide that the clintons are not worth turning out for _meta_end_dot_

 as for the independents i could easily see them doing what sullivan anticipates turning out for mccain and selecting him as the best hope for positive change in any race against the clintons _meta_end_dot_

 meanwhile obama has decided to hit back against bill clinton _meta_end_dot_

 it s a good move and no one can blame him for being fed up _meta_end_dot_

 it is one thing for the former president to campaign for his wife everyone knew that he would _meta_end_dot_

 but as many have pointed out george herbert walker bush did nothing to trash the republican candidates who ran against his son for the nomination in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 the elder bush did the right thing as a titular leader of the republican party _meta_end_dot_

 too bad that clinton has forgotten his responsibilities as a titular leader of the democrats _meta_end_dot_
