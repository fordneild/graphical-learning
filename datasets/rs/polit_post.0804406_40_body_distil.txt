  there have been a number of retirements from the halls of congress over the past few months but we would be remiss if we did not pause to note the surprising retirement of arizona congressman john shadegg _meta_end_dot_

 shadegg has been without mincing words a conservative hero since his election in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 he has fought the left as a consistent spokesman for the values that we espouse at redstate a brave leader against liberal statism across all fronts and a forceful behind the scenes advocate for a consistent and courageous conservatism that is grounded in a strong understanding of human nature and what makes america great _meta_end_dot_

 for years he has been a pitch perfect note in the southwest for the ideals we cherish as a community _meta_end_dot_

 we have supported shadegg in the past including when he stood for a leadership post in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 for the first time since redstate began we cannot support him in this decision _meta_end_dot_

 we would if we could beg shadegg to continue the work he began in _meta_number_ref_ with the insurgent spirit he never lost _meta_end_dot_

 we would if we could beg john mccain to follow the dole _meta_number_ref_ playbook and resign opening up a senate appointment for shadegg to continue to serve _meta_end_dot_

 we would if we could beg john shadegg to stay in washington and fight the good fight once more until it is won _meta_end_dot_

 yet it seems his decision is made and we must unfortunately deal with a house that is missing one truly great warrior for the cause _meta_end_dot_

 as for replacements we know rep _meta_end_dot_

 shadegg s chief of staff sean noble to be a smart dedicated and particularly adept conservative _meta_end_dot_

 we hope that he will consider throwing his hat into the ring to replace the man he has served so well _meta_end_dot_

 and we hope that in any case john shadegg will remain an active leader of the conservative movement in the years to come _meta_end_dot_

 we wish him and his family godspeed and only the best for their future with lasting thanks for his many years of honorable service to the country he loves _meta_end_dot_
