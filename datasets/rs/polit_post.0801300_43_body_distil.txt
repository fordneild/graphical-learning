  understanding that it is entirely possible that a democrat may be elected president and understanding as well that such an election may throw any gains and advances in iraq in peril the bush administration is now working to ensure that it solidifies the gains that have been brought about by the surge and the implementation of the counterinsurgency plan read on _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 as pointed out in the article the end result of such an arrangement is to preempt and render moot the efforts of any future potential democratic president to short circuit the mission in iraq _meta_end_dot_

 smart move _meta_end_dot_

 one certainly hopes that we don t draw down to as few as _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ troops in a precipitous fashion but as long as the administration is crafting an agreement that allows general petraeus a goodly amount of leeway in making the necessary decisions regarding troop levels there would appear to be little chance that a rash decision or two would leave us shorthanded in iraq _meta_end_dot_

 and in any event this will ensure that petraeus s influence remains to affect the actions of the next president whatever the next president s current desire to bring the reconstruction effort in iraq to a precipitous end _meta_end_dot_

 a good move by the administration and one that is backed by the successes that have been brought about by the surge and the counterinsurgency plan _meta_end_dot_

 let s hope the agreement goes through soon _meta_end_dot_

 in time we shall likely be happy that it did just as we are happy that we went forward with the surge and the implementation of the current counterinsurgency strategy _meta_end_dot_
