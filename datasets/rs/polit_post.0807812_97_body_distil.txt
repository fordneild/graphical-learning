  today is the day that oral arguments will be heard in district of columbia vs _meta_end_dot_

 heller the landmark _meta_number_ref_nd amendment case which has potentially far reaching implications for the rights of gun owners throughout the united states _meta_end_dot_

 c span has requested and was granted immediate access to the oral arguments so that they can be broadcast and that should happen at approximately _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ a m _meta_end_dot_

 as most of you know by now this case has reached the supreme court because of the district of columbia s appeal of a lower court ruling which held that its ban on private possession of handguns firearms within the home or possession of loaded or operable firearms for the purposes of self defense was unconstitutional _meta_end_dot_

 from the nra ila website you can read the amicus briefs that have been submitted in the case by third parties on behalf of the plaintiffs and defendants at the link above _meta_end_dot_

 four days ago our own paulseale wrote a popular blog entry about the new policy of district police going door to door to ask permission to search people s homes for guns in exchange for amnesty for any illegal weapons or contraband that are found _meta_end_dot_

 that policy is scheduled to go into effect on march _meta_number_ref_ in high crime areas of the city _meta_end_dot_

 evidently the d c _meta_end_dot_

 police will not be knocking on people s doors in tony georgetown looking for guns and drugs _meta_end_dot_

 even the aclu thinks this is a harebrained scheme and i think it s a pure intimidation tactic that falls one step short of the outrageous firearms confiscation that occured in new orleans by order of ray nagin in the aftermath of hurricane katrina _meta_end_dot_

 remember that in that instance ray nagin s police went house to house confiscating even legally and lawfully owned firearms _meta_end_dot_

 unless i am mistaken because d c _meta_end_dot_

 does not issue licenses for individuals to possess firearms lawfully any gun they find will be illegal _meta_end_dot_

 here is what the nola police did at the very moment their own citizens needed their lawfully owned weapons to protect themselves _meta_end_dot_

 they came clomping in with heavy boots gang tackling old ladies and taking weapons from law abiding citizens legal scholars and ordinary citizens should take keen interest in this case because it is virtually unique in the history of the modern supreme court this is one of the very few instances in which the court has the opportunity to rule on the original intent of the constitution virtually unencumbered by precedent _meta_end_dot_

 for that reason alone it s one of the more important cases the supreme court has heard in our lifetimes _meta_end_dot_

 i will be commenting on the audio as it is released here at redstate and at tmr _meta_end_dot_

 i will also be scouring the web for other relevant commentary today _meta_end_dot_

 full disclosure everyone here at redstate knows where i stand on the d c _meta_end_dot_

 gun ban i believe it s an unconstitutional travesty and that it effectively makes residents of the district of columbia into second class citizens as well as setting an ominous and unconstitutional precedent for cities across the country _meta_end_dot_

 i hope it gets thrown into the deepest reaches of the deep blue sea _meta_end_dot_

 i will have more in this thread as the day goes on _meta_end_dot_

 cross posted the minority report update right now everyone watching c span knows that there is debate going on between the panelists and the callers about the possible extent to which the sc may take this ruling _meta_end_dot_

 one important question is whether or not this _meta_number_ref_nd amendment right is going to be unequivocally construed in this ruling as applying to all of the states _meta_end_dot_

 right now on the democrat line there is a woman who is making precisely the argument that this case hinges on she is an older woman who supports the right of individuals to own guns in their homes for self protection _meta_end_dot_

 as much as there will be vigorous debate during the next few days the court s ruling on this isn t expected to arrive until june _meta_end_dot_

 c span just had a tinfoil hat caller who tried to ask the question of whether the bush administration filed their brief supporting a limited ruling because they want to disarm us while they establish a fascist police state _meta_end_dot_

 hoooeee
