  promoted by jeff i suppose it was only a matter of time before michigan democrats went ahead and intentionally lost their minds _meta_end_dot_

 the high pitched buzzing about scrapping legal election results because the democrat national committee didn t like the date they were gathered is growing more intense by the day with folks here in the state who previously defended michigan now suddenly willing to bow down and kiss the ring on howard dean s middle finger _meta_end_dot_

 read on _meta_end_dot_

 as is generally the case my personal objections seem to have absolutely no bearing on how the lefties in this state mis behave _meta_end_dot_

 alas _meta_end_dot_

 ultimately they shred the rule of law and create a nice little icier than normal banana republic at their own peril _meta_end_dot_

 but we are where we are and it is where it is which may be simultaneously one of the most accurate and painfully clich things i ve ever typed in my life _meta_end_dot_

 my bad _meta_end_dot_

 with every day that passes we re getting closer to a fresh democrat nominating contest here in michigan _meta_end_dot_

 which is different you ll note from holding a fresh primary _meta_end_dot_

 the last primary cost michigan taxpayers some _meta_dollor_ref_ million and even the queen tax hiker in the executive office seems to understand that asking struggling moms and dads to pony up all that cash again is a step or twenty too far _meta_end_dot_

 instead they re talking about holding a firehouse primary with shorter hours and fewer polling locations or a closed caucus _meta_end_dot_

 while every citizen had the right and plenty of opportunity to vote back in january the dems are willing to disenfranchise millions this time around _meta_end_dot_

 nothing like ignoring the will of voters across the state so you can consolidate power with a few thousand union activists _meta_end_dot_

 associated press reports more likely than draining the bank accounts at mdp this sort of thing will energize their donors at all levels _meta_end_dot_

 i d be willing to go out on a limb and suggest that they d end the new primary season more flush with cash than when they start it _meta_end_dot_

 but on the bright side maybe barack obama and hillary clinton will finally show up here in the great lakes state _meta_end_dot_

 maybe _meta_end_dot_

 we re not good enough for them right now because they don t and haven t needed us _meta_end_dot_

 in lefty circles the concept of public service carries a lot of baggage and quid pro quos _meta_end_dot_

 we re not scratching their back so why would they even look at ours it s not like michigan issues are getting any less urgent or important _meta_end_dot_

 though silver lining it looks like the united auto workers may finally be ready to sit down with the folks at american axle _meta_end_dot_

 good thing too _meta_end_dot_

 experts claim that should the strike extend into next week it will close as many as ten auto plants _meta_end_dot_

 they re already more than halfway there _meta_end_dot_

 the ivory tower reports but while they re finally talking at aa there isn t much actual conversation between kwame kilpatrick and a few angry residents _meta_end_dot_

 they re skipping past all the chit chat and going straight for the throat kicking off a recall campaign to oust hizzoner _meta_end_dot_

 according to the detroit news well best of luck mr _meta_end_dot_

 johnson _meta_end_dot_

 you re going to need it _meta_end_dot_

 we re talking about a mayor who was reelected in a city while rumors and assumptions about rampant wrong doing corruption and even deaths circled his head like an ominous little black thunder cloud _meta_end_dot_

 heck they d probably do it again _meta_end_dot_

 it s that whole thing about leading a horse to water _meta_end_dot_
