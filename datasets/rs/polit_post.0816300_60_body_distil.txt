  on february _meta_number_ref_ the pakistani government and the taliban jointly signed a peace treaty dealing with the north waziristan region of the afghan pakistani border area see graphic at right and click for more detailed map _meta_end_dot_

 the agreement was shrouded in secrecy with its terms being kept under wraps by both parties _meta_end_dot_

 this weekend a pakistani news organization the daily times managed to obtain a copy of the agreement which they roughly outlined on their web site _meta_end_dot_

 they report that the agreement inked between the government and the utmanzai tribes on february _meta_number_ref_ to fight taliban linked militancy through support from the local population contains the following terms read on _meta_end_dot_

 apparently as part of this agreement pakistan released sufi mohammed a senior taliban leader with ties to pakistani and afghan taliban who had been in custody since _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 this is not the first time pakistan has entered into an agreement with taliban leaders and related militants in the name of peace rather it is simply the most recent attempt by the pakistani government to buy off the al qaeda and taliban legions who have spent the last three years conquering northwest pakistan and turning it into a lawless realm over which they hold sway and in which they can operate unmolested by legal authorities _meta_end_dot_

 two years ago a cease fire was declared between pakistan and the taliban and as war on terror and counterterrorism experts bill roggio and daveed gartenstein ross wrote in the weekly standard the taliban has violated each of the conditions of those now infamous september _meta_number_ref_ waziristan accords they continue the long war journal pointed out in his initial report of the contents of the _meta_number_ref_ waziristan treaty the first time the story was reported in america this second truce which would ostensibly prohibit the taliban from harboring foreign terrorists attacking government or military personnel or hindering the movement of aid workers all concessions which as roggio pointed out taliban leaders have ignored in the past would be accompanied by a complete withdrawal of pakistani troops from the area the release of several pakistani soldiers being held by the taliban and the release of several taliban prisoners currently in pakistani custody _meta_end_dot_

 pakistan s ebbing will to take on those terrorists who threaten both its leaders and its institutions not to mention the stability of its northwestern neighbor which currently faces its best chance at a peaceful future in decades is and should be a matter of concern to america her allies and others who stand to benefit from success in this key front in the war on terror _meta_end_dot_

 thanks in part to the pakistani government s longstanding unwillingness to consistently deal aggressively with the taliban s encroachment into their nw border territory the former afghan ruling party and its terrorist allies have for several years now had a haven to which they can retreat and in which they can regroup and rebuild while planning and preparing offensives and attacks against the coalition in afghanistan and against governments and countries farther away _meta_end_dot_

 according to owais ahmed ghani the governor of pakistan s northwest frontier province the lack of outside threats combined with a growing income from the opium poppy trade which is being successfully stemmed in much of the rest of afghanistan has provided the taliban leadership in south waziristan the time and income to be able to spend at least _meta_dollor_ref_ million and possibly as much as _meta_dollor_ref_ million or more per year procuring weapons equipment vehicles treating wounded militants and keeping families of killed militants fed though the vast majority goes toward the former three rather than the latter two _meta_end_dot_

 the _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ commission estimated that al qaeda was spending _meta_dollor_ref_ million per year on weapons and supplies prior to the sept _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ attacks that spurred the u s _meta_end_dot_

 into overt action against global terrorism _meta_end_dot_

 according to the recent nato report entitled progress in afghanistan pdf the broad international effort to help afghanistan build a more stable and secure future is achievable and it is being achieved unfortunately work toward that achievement has had to be done in spite of an ever growing lack of cooperation from the country in the best geographic position to most effectively bolster or undermine the coalition s efforts to establish a successful afghanistan _meta_end_dot_

 the more pakistan pleads and negotiates from a position of weakness with terrorist organizations that are threatening the more it reinforces its own vulnerability to the tactics of terror _meta_end_dot_

 giving in to those who threaten or perpetrate violence does not buy long term peace stability or security rather it teaches those doing the threatening that their tactics are effective and that their actions will be rewarded with concessions and pleas for peace pakistan has gone from a generally respectable ally in the war on terror to over time a full blown enabler of al qaeda and taliban activity _meta_end_dot_

 a study released june _meta_number_ref_ by the rand corp _meta_end_dot_

 entitled counterinsurgency in afghanistan pdf stated that coalition success in afghanistan hinges on three factors one of which is the need of the united states and other international actors need to eliminate the insurgents support base in pakistan the report continues convincing the government of pakistan to undermine the sanctuary on its soil emphasis added far from moving in this positive direction the repeated offerings of peace and concession being made by prime minister yousaf razza gillani and the pakistani government to the taliban leaders of the northwest frontier province are not only making pakistan itself a more dangerous place but are providing key members of one of the world s most prolific terrorist networks the time space and resources to continue planning and executing attacks on both small and large scales _meta_end_dot_

 the conditions al qaeda enjoyed in the taliban s afghanistan in the years and months leading up to the massive attacks of september _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ are now being replicated in waziristan courtesy of a pakistani government that would rather cave in to terrorists for the purpose of being able to claim agreement to a fleeting ephemeral respite from attack rather than actually stand up to those same terrorists and do what is necessary to put a dent in terrorism worldwide while simultaneously achieving a lasting peace in the region _meta_end_dot_

 whatever contributions they may have made to the initial effort in afghanistan and elsewhere in the global war on terror halting as they were given pervez musharraf s overarching concern for the security of his own power rather than for that of his nation or its allies pakistan can no longer be considered an ally in the ongoing fight to rebuild and secure afghanistan nor in the effort to defeat global terror networks for the purpose of protecting america and her allies from terrorist attack _meta_end_dot_

 whatever effort was being made by the pakistani government to deal with the terrorist and insurgent threat growing once again under its very nose according to the rand report unfortunately pakistan a country which needed a strong showing in the war on terror if for no other reason than to make amends for its past culpability in the proliferation of nuclear weapons and technology to such rogue states as north korea and libya can no longer be counted on to assist that effort in any significant capacity _meta_end_dot_
