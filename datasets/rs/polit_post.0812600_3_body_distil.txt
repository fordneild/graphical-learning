 hillary on tw _meta_end_dot_

 on abc s this week host george stephanopoulos handled a sort of forum for his former boss hillary _meta_end_dot_

 there were people sitting formally in an audience where they were in indianapolis and there was another generic audience on by satellite from north carolina _meta_end_dot_

 rows and rows of calm non violent dems _meta_end_dot_

 the host and hillary started seated but they both stood up as the forum progressed _meta_end_dot_

 hillary talked of her comprehensive energy policy which she says involves taxing the excess profits of the big oil companies _meta_end_dot_

 she sneered that elite opinion is always on the side of harming americans which makes sense given that he rival for the dem nomination has been called an elitist she said that we may not be able to bring back the exact jobs we ve lost to foreign countries but we cannot afford to keep losing them _meta_end_dot_

 this is similar to a dustup between john mccain and mitt romney and michigan with romney promising to bring back the same jobs which had moved overseas she said that she and stephanopoulos had meetings together on nafta which she said made sense when we were stronger at the end of the _meta_number_ref_th century _meta_end_dot_

 now she s going to renegotiate and fix nafta the failure of which she blamed on the republican congress for not giving us universal health care like they have overseas _meta_end_dot_

 hillary said that no matter how this race turns out we ll have a great candidate for the fall obama on mtp _meta_end_dot_

 on meet the press host tim russert interviewed presumptive dem nominee barack obama leading off with jeremiah wright _meta_end_dot_

 obama called the controversy distracting he added that it wasn t welcome he added that the american people understand that when he joined trinity united he was committing not to wright but to the church black liberation theology etc and to christ _meta_end_dot_

 he defended the church for working on poverty and social issues _meta_end_dot_

 he said that when wright made the statements which barry says he found objectionable his first thought was that they did not define wright _meta_end_dot_

 when wright worsened his comments before the national press club obama felt it was important that we understand that this is not what he believes and it does not represent the african american church _meta_end_dot_

 obama told russert that he is still a member of wright s church _meta_end_dot_

 obama thinks that what with wright retiring having the spotlight was attractive to him obama here accused wright of being just a showman perhaps in retaliation for wright having accused him at the national press club of being just a politician _meta_end_dot_

 vengeance is mine sayeth the man s ego _meta_end_dot_

 obama added that he thinks wright failed to understand that they only way they can solve the problems the church has sought to address is by the country coming together i e _meta_end_dot_

 electing barry _meta_end_dot_

 russert asked why it took so long for obama to lose the wright albatross _meta_end_dot_

 he played a clip of obama s famous race speech where he said that he could no more disown wright than he could disown his white grandmother _meta_end_dot_

 russert ended the clip before the part where obama referred to his grandmother as a racist then russert played a clip five weeks later of obama trying to reject and repudiate wright last tuesday and he pointed out that obama had known about wright s beliefs at least since march _meta_end_dot_

 what changed in the past five weeks _meta_end_question_

 obama said that wrights views could no longer be explained away as spliced bits from sermons _meta_end_dot_

 he said that further that this showed that wright didn t have much regard for the moment we re in right now right here in the united states where we have to elect obama and bring the country together _meta_end_dot_

 it was disappointing that he did not know wright as well as he thought he did _meta_end_dot_

 he said that he didn t want wright s words to distract from his candidacy _meta_end_dot_

 obama proclaimed that because he is half black and half white it is in his dna to believe that we can come together regardless of race _meta_end_dot_

 russert asked obama if it is fair to judge his judgment based on his misjudgment of reverend wright _meta_end_dot_

 obama said sure if you include all the other things he s done in the last twenty years _meta_end_dot_

 obama said that he will never seek wright s counsel if elected president in fact he s never sought wright s counsel as far as politics _meta_end_dot_

 not even at _meta_number_ref_am he said that wright was never his spiritual advisor or mentor _meta_end_dot_

 he was my pastor the first fifteen minutes went by with soft questions and lengthy answers regarding barry and the rev _meta_end_dot_

 then russert moved on to the possible swiftboating or obama this fall questioning his patriotism _meta_end_dot_

 barry said that he will not stand by and allow somebody to challenge his patriotism _meta_end_dot_

 twenty three minutes into this they started talking about obama s new found opposition to a temporary reduction in the gas tax _meta_end_dot_

 he talked about hillary saying that she would obliterate iran if it were to attack israel saying this was not the language we need right now rather the use of the verb obliterate is reflective of george bush on tw steph asked hillary about obama s statement _meta_end_dot_

 she said that we had to be clear to the mullahs that they would face massive retaliation i miss these cold war terms they talked about corn for food or for ethanol _meta_end_dot_

 barry says that we have a serious food problem caused by global climate change barry says we have to look at nuclear power _meta_end_dot_

 and he talked about forcing the iraqis to fend for themselves because we are fanning the flames of hatred _meta_end_dot_

 clyburn on ftn _meta_end_dot_

 host bob schieffer of cbs s face the nation spoke first to house dem whip james clyburn d south carolina the guy who says that hillary is in this race to tear down barry for racial reasons _meta_end_dot_

 he feels that the wright controversy has been a distraction from the message of change offered by hillary and obama _meta_end_dot_

 he claimed that he never said that the clintons were trying to weaken obama so she could run again rather young people were telling him that this is what they believed _meta_end_dot_

 clyburn feels that barry has to tell blue collar workers what it s like to be raised by a single parent and handed off to your grandparents as blue collar workers can identify with this _meta_end_dot_

 on wright clyburn argued that the church was the body of christ not the pastor and barry was explaining this well _meta_end_dot_

 schieffer asked him if whites were using wright as an excuse not to vote for obama and clyburn said that it was not just whites _meta_end_dot_

 he thinks people look for cover in such issues _meta_end_dot_

 schieffer asked clyburn what would happen if obama came in to denver with the most elected delegates yet the nomination was given to hillary _meta_end_dot_

 since doug wilder told him several months ago that there would be riots if this happened schieffer s been thinking of this clyburn said that the superdelegates should not overturn the will of the voters without a good reason _meta_end_dot_

 he believes that the person who finishes second in this race will be more important than the winner _meta_end_dot_

 he thinks the dems will be united no matter what _meta_end_dot_

 wilder and bayh on ftn _meta_end_dot_

 host schieffer next spoke to obama supporter doug wilder and hillary backer evan bayh who was on his cell phone when the interview began _meta_end_dot_

 schieffer asked wilder about his riot comment several months ago and he said that if there is the perception that the nomination was stolen there would be a riotous convention not in the streets it would take an unprecedented landslide he said for hillary to catch up with barry _meta_end_dot_

 it turned out that the interview was being conducted over bayh s cell phone as the satellite sound from indianapolis was not functioning _meta_end_dot_

 he pointed out that hillary wants to be the champion of the middle class those worried about health care costs and gas prices _meta_end_dot_

 he called hillary a fighter with fortitude she s in this for the american people and to stand strong for them he said that hillary has a little more experience and can deliver schieffer asked wilder if hillary should stay in if she wins indiana and north carolina _meta_end_dot_

 wilder said that she should stay in for as long as she wants _meta_end_dot_

 wilder claimed that right wing commentators were literally begging people to vote for hillary because many of them think hillary would be the weakest some of them enjoy this dem primary bayh said that hoosiers indiana voters will not listen to splitter joe andrews a hoosier himself _meta_end_dot_

 wilder explained that what s sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander they argued about who voted for a gas tax holiday and wilder argued that obama had learned from his mistakes _meta_end_dot_

 schieffer described the dem party as being split by a thousand fissures and asked if there would be a dream ticket wilder dodged the question and bayh thinks only that they ll work together in the fall richardson and easley on le _meta_end_dot_

 on cnn s late edition host wolf blitzer led off by talking to dem governors bill richardson of new mexico and mike easley of north carolina pro obama and pro hillary respectively _meta_end_dot_

 richardson said barry was right about hillary s obliterate iran language because barry s foreign policy is going to be one of negotiation with the grand mullahs in iran _meta_end_dot_

 now is not the time to saber rattle we need diplomacy and negotiation and getting u n _meta_end_dot_

 support easley agrees that diplomacy is the way to start _meta_end_dot_

 he said that hillary agrees but we have to be very clear to iran that they cannot touch israel _meta_end_dot_

 blitzer asked easley if she could upset obama in north carolina and easley said that this depends on the definition of upset hillary has shrunk the margin _meta_end_dot_

 he added that people trust hillary on the economy and can turn the economy around quickly richardson pointed out that obama had won guam _meta_end_dot_

 he believes that obama will prevail in north carolina and will do well in indiana _meta_end_dot_

 he leads in delegates he said _meta_end_dot_

 blitzer argued that hillary has a stronger electoral college advantage because of the states she s won _meta_end_dot_

 richardson argued that obama has a shot at both ohio and pennsylvania _meta_end_dot_

 easley countered that we re not going to win the white house by winning guam i can tell you that _meta_end_dot_

 he added that hillary wins the reagan democrats questions like who can bring out the young voters easley said are not as important to him as who can be the best president _meta_end_dot_

 the conversation turned to jeremiah wright _meta_end_dot_

 governor easley said that it won t be an issue in this primary he added that obama had done what he had to do i e _meta_end_dot_

 attempt to jettison his pastor _meta_end_dot_

 he added that african americans in north carolina do not worship the way wright does _meta_end_dot_

 richardson said that obama gave a critically important speech on race when he first learned of reverend wright s comments and he accused wright of seeking financial gain and notoriety because of the controversy _meta_end_dot_

 easley thinks this contest could go all the way to denver and he thinks that would be good for the country having more people stand up and be a part of america richardson said that it is important that they have a nominee after the remaining nine contests _meta_end_dot_

 if it goes to denver he said it will be bad for the party sob sob sob sob and sob _meta_end_dot_

 ron paul on le _meta_end_dot_

 ron paul told blitzer that he s still in the race because he s still generating enthusiasm and money and because he wants to get out of iraq _meta_end_dot_

 he said that he s not ready to endorse mccain _meta_end_dot_

 he implied that he s read the constitution though the veracity of this is not clear _meta_end_dot_

 the interview seemed to last all of _meta_number_ref_ seconds _meta_end_dot_

 wow _meta_end_dot_
