  i ll be gone for the day and most of the evening i have a performer s revel to attend with the parents on hand to watch the baby and thus allow the wife and i the pleasure of an afternoon off to listen to medieval performance pieces present medieval performance pieces sip wine and eat what promises to be a really good dinner so we ll put this up now_meta_beep_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 today s going to be kansas and washington for us and louisiana nebraska the virgin islands and washington for the democrats _meta_end_dot_

 we have a real dearth of polls for this one _meta_end_dot_

 the general assumption is that mccain s probably going to win both because he s the front runner but i think huckabee s got a shot at at least kansas _meta_end_dot_

 as for the dems _meta_end_dot_

 it s assumed that it s going to be a sweep for obama either because they re either caucuses ne vi wa or because he s an african american la _meta_end_dot_

 that s not just me being snarky that s really why he s projected to win em _meta_end_dot_

 please note i m being critical of the national news organizations who have not told us one darned thing about these races not the people who are merely extrapolating from past trends _meta_end_dot_

 for them i ll just note _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 or _meta_percent_ref_ for those of you who still think that the two states aren t going to be seated _meta_end_dot_

 see you guys tonight _meta_end_dot_

 moe lane arl and our other democratic readers will no doubt be relieved to hear that they have both mostly repented of their earlier republican flirtations and are now back to going with the democratic nominee _meta_end_dot_

 indeed and unlike obama girl they voted for the fellow _meta_end_dot_

 don t pop the champagne yet though _meta_end_dot_

 they ll change their minds at least twice between now and november _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_beep_ref_i suggest that all y all go do something similarly not digital tonight _meta_end_dot_

 unless you re materially involved with the campaigning or voting in one of the above states of course _meta_end_dot_

 go take care of that first then go do something not digital _meta_end_dot_

 it s saturday after all _meta_end_dot_
