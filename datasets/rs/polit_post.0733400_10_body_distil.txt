  the economy grew at _meta_number_ref_ _meta_percent_ref_ last quarter _meta_end_dot_

 that means americans created _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ trillion in goods and services in _meta_number_ref_q _meta_number_ref_ and _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ trillion in _meta_number_ref_q _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 americans created an additional _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ in goods and services than this time a year ago _meta_end_dot_

 the media should really look into the mirror about its economic reporting _meta_end_dot_

 when an economy is expanding at this hot of a clip it is hard to understand why most people feel so financially insecure _meta_end_dot_

 unfortunately the msm has created a narrative of economic insecurity that they are unlikely to change when it does not match up with the economic facts at hand _meta_end_dot_

 it is assumed that _meta_number_ref_q will see slower growth which would be more normal _meta_end_dot_

 but the idea that we are already in a recession is a rather outlandish suggestion _meta_end_dot_

 america is fortunate to be so rich and to be getting so much richer each year _meta_end_dot_

 due to our economic freedom we have increased our output in the last _meta_number_ref_ months by more than an entire year of production of morocco _meta_end_dot_

 so we took our already large economy and added a morocco sized one to it _meta_end_dot_

 yeah we re that good _meta_end_dot_
