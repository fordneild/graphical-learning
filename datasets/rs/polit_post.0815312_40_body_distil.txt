  a bit of republican history was made today in south carolina _meta_end_dot_

 glenn mccall won a race for rnc committeeman _meta_end_dot_

 mccall becomes the first black committeeman ever elected to the rnc from south carolina and only the second from the south _meta_end_dot_

 mccall is presently the york county gop chairman _meta_end_dot_

 he s an effective organizer and spokesman _meta_end_dot_

 a huckabee supporter during the primary mccall told the audience compassionate conservatism does not mean spending _meta_end_dot_

 it means engaging in the community going into crisis pregnancy centers in the black community explaining why the gop is the best party for individuals regardless of race and it means confronting obama s vision for america _meta_end_dot_

 we congratulate glenn mccall and we hope he will join us as fresh voices in the gop ready to clean house and return to our conservative roots that put freedom first _meta_end_dot_
