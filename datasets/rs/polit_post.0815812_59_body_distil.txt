  cartoonist tom toles he won the contest the post held to find a cartoonist both dumber and less insightful than the deceased herblock _meta_end_dot_

 this should serve as a warning to the mccain camp _meta_end_dot_

 the _meta_number_ref_ campaign is not against a fairly lightweight unaccomplished first term senator with a habit of shooting from the lip and no apparent interest in or knowledge of either foreign or domestic policy _meta_end_dot_

 in the _meta_number_ref_ campaign john mccain is fighting a metaphor not arguing policy or even facts _meta_end_dot_

 unless he does something to strip away the patina of a transcendent post racial leader who will usher in the age of aquarius from barack obama john mccain will spend election day shouting where is the outrage
