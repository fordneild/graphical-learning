  brother jeff has touched on this issue at significant and valuable length but it is worth emphasizing that many of the same people who put up a hue and cry sometimes with a fair amount of justification it should be noted against the onset of big brother in the united states went quietly along with the plan to create a national fingerprint database _meta_end_dot_

 and for what _meta_end_question_

 to regulate the housing and the home mortgage markets _meta_end_dot_

 recall that intrusive measures to combat terrorism are regularly decried again at times for understandable reasons because they purportedly shred our constitutional rights and obliterate any and all remnants of our privacy _meta_end_dot_

 and yet the creation of a national fingerprint database actually appears to be moving smoothly through the deliberative process with barely a voice raised in protest in the halls of power _meta_end_dot_

 this measure is an ineffective waste of time that will do more to bring about a brave new world than the usa patriot act ever would and yet no one appears to be making much of a fuss _meta_end_dot_

 we are seeing yet again the validation of ronald reagan s observation that a government big enough to give you what you want is also big enough to take it away from you and yet this story hasn t even graduated to the backburner level _meta_end_dot_

 i hear there is a presidential election this year _meta_end_dot_

 i daresay that it would be a marvelous idea for john mccain to run against this plan and against all the other manifestations of big government and big brother threatening to alter society irredeemably and for the worse _meta_end_dot_

 running against big government is good politics good policy and as it appears more needed now than ever _meta_end_dot_

 at some point the meddlesome hand of the regulatory state has to be stayed _meta_end_dot_

 if a stand is not taken against this how much worse will it have to get before we collectively say enough is enough _meta_end_question_
