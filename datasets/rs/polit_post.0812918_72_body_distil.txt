  global financial markets have been in disorder for nine months now _meta_end_dot_

 the birthday of the crisis is august _meta_number_ref_ there are widespread indications that the most fearsome disruptions in the credit and interbank lending markets are now abating around the world thanks to aggressive and unprecedented actions by monetary authorities _meta_end_dot_

 of these the bernanke geithner federal reserve deserves the lion s share of the credit _meta_end_dot_

 it s entirely true to say that the world of finance has been fundamentally changed by the fed s response _meta_end_dot_

 but for good or for ill _meta_end_question_

 and what should happen next _meta_end_question_

 as it turns out this is an incredibly important question that carries an extraordinary amount of political risk _meta_end_dot_

 and it needs to be fully aired in the current political campaign _meta_end_dot_

 milton friedman repeated the observation that change only happens at moments of real or perceived crisis _meta_end_dot_

 he astutely added that when change comes it s based on whatever ideas happen to be lying around at the time _meta_end_dot_

 today those ideas are overwhelmingly on the side of massive new regulation of not only financial markets but also of the real economy _meta_end_dot_

 is there an alternative _meta_end_question_

 read on _meta_end_dot_

 a naked free market is totally unregulated _meta_end_dot_

 in this environment risk management standards are ad hoc rather than mandated but they re strictly enforced by market participants because those participants are fully exposed to the consequences of risk _meta_end_dot_

 you can say that this is the state of nature for human commerce _meta_end_dot_

 it s the way people have done business since our ancestors started trading bananas in trees _meta_end_dot_

 as soon as you add a little government intervention to the mix you fundamentally distort market behavior in ways that are unavoidable and self reinforcing _meta_end_dot_

 that s because the public is socializing risk that is taken by market players which is equivalent to reducing its cost _meta_end_dot_

 therefore a rational actor will take more risk than he would have had he been exposed to the full consequences of his actions _meta_end_dot_

 but this means that the market as a whole will necessarily take too much risk _meta_end_dot_

 think about it if the guy who manages the hedge fund across the street from you dials up his exposure or his beta then you have to match him _meta_end_dot_

 otherwise he ll get all the customers _meta_end_dot_

 that s one of the built in factors that leads markets to over react to stimuli _meta_end_dot_

 it s a natural effect like thunderstorms and just about as amenable to legislative control _meta_end_dot_

 the problem today is that in responding so effectively to disasters like the collapse of the bear stearns companies the fed has now created an all but explicit guarantee of financial market stability _meta_end_dot_

 they have done this by steadily expanding the scope of activities and the kinds of organizations that can take advantage of the fed s liquidity creation tools _meta_end_dot_

 this amounts to a bottomless pit of available capital to cover market losses _meta_end_dot_

 we are in this situation today and it is indeed stabilizing the financial markets which are suffering primarily from an unnatural amount of risk aversion _meta_end_dot_

 particularly counterparty risk aversion this will inevitably result in further disruptions in financial markets _meta_end_dot_

 you can t avoid this people it s hard wired into human nature _meta_end_dot_

 if you underprice risk or equivalently shift the cost of risk to shareholders limited partners and taxpayers then people will take too much risk _meta_end_dot_

 if you take too much risk you will have an unhealthy amount of failure _meta_end_dot_

 what s the natural response to this _meta_end_question_

 yes quite absolutely right the first thought that popped into your head was correct _meta_end_dot_

 we have to regulate financial market activity more so as to damp out the incremental risk arising from the social guarantee _meta_end_dot_

 i ll let you think about that for a moment _meta_end_dot_

 turn it around a couple more times in your head _meta_end_dot_

 no there s no way around it _meta_end_dot_

 you re seeing that now _meta_end_question_

 good let s continue _meta_end_dot_

 this indeed is what congress is up to spearheaded by people like barney frank in the house and chris dodd in the senate and abetted less than willingly by richard shelby the ranking minority member of the senate finance committee _meta_end_dot_

 shelby actually is a conservative but is afraid to step out too far on a limb in an environment in which the charge of hooverism is all too readily applied to republicans _meta_end_dot_

 and in which the administration has signalled its intention not to fight new democratic regulations what would be a totally different approach to the problem _meta_end_question_

 naked capital markets _meta_end_dot_

 would it be somehow possible to get rid of essentially all of the regulations that govern markets in essence to fully roll back the early new deal and simultaneously to eliminate the federal reserve s guarantee of emergency liquidity _meta_end_question_

 would that take us back to a land in which people understood that they were taking risks with their own money instead of someone else s and they d make their decisions fully in light of that fact _meta_end_question_

 intelligent de facto standards for managing capital ratios and counterparty risk would spontaneously arise and be strictly enforced _meta_end_dot_

 there are two problems with this approach that i don t know how to solve _meta_end_dot_

 first we live in a global fiat money world _meta_end_dot_

 to the best of my knowledge it s historically unprecedented to have a fiat currency fully controlled by the government of one nation the dollar as the accepted unit of exchange for all global trade _meta_end_dot_

 the euro the yen and increasingly renminbi are important but very far from dominant currencies regardless of what you might read in the wall street journal is there a safety valve in a unipolar fiat money world _meta_end_question_

 there s only one and sure enough it s being heavily used real commodities _meta_end_dot_

 lack of confidence about the dollar is precisely and unequivocally the dominant factor that has taken prices of crude oil industrial metals dry goods shipping hulls oilseeds etc etc to multi century highs _meta_end_dot_

 it may be impossible to have naked markets when the medium of exchange is as fluid as the dollar _meta_end_dot_

 i m not sure about that but when i decide i ll let you know _meta_end_dot_

 second naked markets do not solve the basic problem that regulation was originally intended to solve markets panic occasionally _meta_end_dot_

 i usually tell you to imagine that markets are like people _meta_end_dot_

 in this case imagine that markets are like dogs _meta_end_dot_

 they don t suffer permanent damage when they get wet _meta_end_dot_

 but when they do they plant their feet and shake violently from side to side _meta_end_dot_

 and everyone who s standing nearby gets soaked with stinky dog water _meta_end_dot_

 it s simply natural for markets to do this _meta_end_dot_

 every now and then they panic _meta_end_dot_

 a lot of healthy players take big hits a few well positioned contrarians become billionaires and all the marginal players go to the wall _meta_end_dot_

 the only way to eliminate this behavior is not to have free markets in the first place _meta_end_dot_

 which is precisely what regulation is intended to accomplish _meta_end_dot_

 the ironic thing is that even heavy regulation can t eliminate the potential for market panics _meta_end_dot_

 if you doubt that look at what china is having to deal with now with inflation and unemployment _meta_end_dot_

 and the federal reserve continues to look for ever more creative responses to the problem _meta_end_dot_

 i don t fault ben bernanke one bit in all of this _meta_end_dot_

 he and his colleagues are acutely aware of the damage they will cause if they try to take over the economy _meta_end_dot_

 they re looking for stability not increased power _meta_end_dot_

 but there is a deep conundrum packed inside their approach _meta_end_dot_

 in naked markets people directly suffer the consequences of their bad decisions and their bad luck _meta_end_dot_

 when you socialize these risks in a quest for stability you implicitly expose everyone to those consequences whether or not they choose to be so exposed _meta_end_dot_

 and you ultimately make the problem far worse because a little moral hazard goes a long long way _meta_end_dot_

 far more regulation is probably inevitable in the current political season _meta_end_dot_

 we have to figure out how to avoid throwing all of the babies out with the bathwater _meta_end_dot_
