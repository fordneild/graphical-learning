  i like fred thompson _meta_end_dot_

 i like his conservative views i like his demeanor i like his sense of humor and i think he would have made a solid choice for republican nominee _meta_end_dot_

 but in iowa he finished a distant third barely ahead of a john mccain who barely campaigned there _meta_end_dot_

 last night thompson finished a distant third barely ahead of a mitt romney who in the last days barely campaigned there _meta_end_dot_

 in new hampshire and michigan his numbers barely registered _meta_end_dot_

 the florida polls must be discouraging for thompson with the former tennessee senator in a depressing fifth place at _meta_number_ref_ _meta_percent_ref_ going by the rcp average _meta_end_dot_

 i just don t see a thompson surge happening in florida not with him so far behind _meta_end_dot_

 because of this i think his chances of getting nominated have moved from slim to none _meta_end_dot_

 this is hard to take news for his supporters and i feel your pain but there it is _meta_end_dot_

 as i see it around nine or ten months ago thompson captured a little political magic in a bottle but the problem is that he opened that bottle three months after the expiration date _meta_end_dot_

 he started too late and he never caught up _meta_end_dot_

 as ben pointed out peter robinson s analogy is incredibly apt _meta_end_dot_

 more below the fold _meta_end_dot_

 thompson did not have enough appeal to garner enough votes for himself in south carolina but he did have enough influence after directly challenging mike huckabee on his economic liberalism and whatnot to pull enough votes away from the former arkansas governor to put john mccain over the top _meta_end_dot_

 going forward if thompson wants to maximize his influence on the race and i ll grant you that it s a big if his best option in my opinion is to drop out and stand behind john mccain full disclosure if anyone doesn t know it by now i decided to support mccain for the reasons stated early last november _meta_end_dot_

 not only that i d like to see fred thompson stump for john mccain nationwide _meta_end_dot_

 why _meta_end_question_

 because there are too many conservatives who distrust mccain _meta_end_dot_

 fred thompson could be a party unifier and quite frankly i think we can all use a little unifying after these long months of hard fought campaigning _meta_end_dot_

 thompson has enough support from social and economic conservatives to bring us a solid base going forward especially if thompson is a presumptive running mate _meta_end_dot_

 unusual times call for unusual measures _meta_end_dot_

 if president cannot be had i think most of us could agree that thompson would be a helluva vice president _meta_end_dot_

 thompson and mccain are friends and onetime senate colleagues _meta_end_dot_

 during the campaign they did not go negative against each other and in fact they expressed mutual admiration and respect _meta_end_dot_

 they would make a great team though it may look a little funny with them standing side by side with thompson being about a foot taller than the vertically challenged arizona senator _meta_end_dot_

 fred thompson can complement john mccain s weak spots among conservatives _meta_end_dot_

 on immigration thompson could stand behind mccain and say that when john mccain says he ll enforce the borders first and deport illegal immigrants who ve committed felonies that s what he ll do and i ll be here to enforce his pledge first on judges thompson could say whatever about the gang of _meta_number_ref_ but he could assure conservatives that mccain s judicial picks would be along the lines of roberts and alito _meta_end_dot_

 on taxes mccain could go as far as adopting a chunk of thompson s tax plan which is a pretty good one _meta_end_dot_

 this would improve mccain s standing among economic conservatives it would tell the conservative community that he is not so wedded to his positions that he wouldn t consider new and better ideas and it would dampen the political hits mccain has taken for voting nay on bush s tax cut proposals _meta_end_dot_

 fred thompson is a southerner and the gop needs southerners _meta_end_dot_

 but like mccain thompson also has good cross party appeal _meta_end_dot_

 remember self described conservatives comprise maybe one third of the electorate on the best of days _meta_end_dot_

 to win we need the best conservatives available and the best candidates available who can draw independents and moderate democrats _meta_end_dot_

 one of the arguments against mccain thompson besides the height differential is that they re both senators and a senator has not won since _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 but in _meta_number_ref_ a democratic senator is going to get nominated and that senator may just select another senator for vice president _meta_end_dot_

 the argument would be moot for mccain thompson _meta_end_dot_

 ronald reagan was known to say that the republican who agrees with us _meta_percent_ref_ of the time is not our opponent _meta_end_dot_

 a mccain thompson ticket would satisfy that _meta_percent_ref_ minimum and then some _meta_end_dot_
