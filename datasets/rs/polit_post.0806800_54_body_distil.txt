  we ve had a bunch of people weigh in on this in the diaries and around the blogosphere and i don t have much to add except to say that if you actually watch the video of senator mccain s exchange with ny times reporter elisabeth bumiller it s pretty clear that mccain is doing exactly what he should be doing when confronted with a gotcha question about an old story on which there are no new facts and the reporter is just trying to pick a fight the times and ms _meta_end_dot_

 bumiller are not on john mccain s side and there s every indication by this point that he is well aware of that fact and is now dealing with them accordingly _meta_end_dot_

 unlike the obama camp mccain is no stranger to the national spotlight he was quoted on the front page of the times as far back as _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 not to point out the obvious but john mccain has been tested by strains far worse than ms _meta_end_dot_

 bumiller s questioning here _meta_end_dot_

 sure it s well known that the man has a temper _meta_end_dot_

 many successful presidents have _meta_end_dot_

 but there s a time and a place for getting your irish up righteous indignation is no sin and this seems like one of them _meta_end_dot_

 i can t even imagine a single voter who would watch this video and be somehow distressed by the man s judgment _meta_end_dot_
