  the charge that obama is an elitist might stick but that isn t what s wrong with him or the democrats _meta_end_dot_

 that he presumes to know best how to parent our children helps explain the problem with him and his party _meta_end_dot_

 it s quite funny really to think mr _meta_end_dot_

 obama knows best how the rest of us should parent our children when it s safe to say he plays a miniscule role in parenting his own _meta_end_dot_

 the man is never home telling others how to do something they rarely if ever do themselves is the problem with democrats and obama is the poster boy for them all when it comes to telling the rest of us how to live and what to do _meta_end_dot_

 if he takes the kids with him everywhere he goes then they are not in school tutored perhaps or home schooled each of these possibilities antithetical to what he and his minions believe in for a democrat world read liberal and or progressive or both _meta_end_dot_

 peruse the new dr _meta_end_dot_

 spock s insight on life with children you know what i am going to say next _meta_end_dot_

 pause why is he blaming us then _meta_end_question_

 why does he presume to understand what s wrong in our collective lives and scold us about how we need to behave in order for us to be happy with ourselves and our futures _meta_end_question_

 more below the did he really just say that fold _meta_end_dot_

 barack obama is the problem in washington _meta_end_dot_

 he is not doing his job how many votes has he missed over the years or wasted with a present when he was in il state politics _meta_end_question_

 his fellow senators and representatives in the people s house aren t doing their jobs either _meta_end_dot_

 obama et _meta_end_dot_

 al _meta_end_dot_

 have clearly forgotten who s who in the food chain of american governance we the people ring a bell kids _meta_end_question_

 apparently the junior senator believes he ll solve the world s problems by yelling at those of us who pay his salary and telling us why we re mad in the first place _meta_end_dot_

 i know the quote has been plastered everywhere but i get my own shot at it umm no barry _meta_end_dot_

 i live in a small town myself amongst some who believe the civil war is but paused at cease fire status _meta_end_dot_

 we here in rural america cling to guns because we can and because we don t trust government alone to keep us safe _meta_end_dot_

 we cling to religion because we choose to and because we believe in something greater than ourselves unlike our hapless government that behaves as if it is the greater power in our lives _meta_end_dot_

 again we don t trust government to take care of us every time they try more harm than good comes from it _meta_end_dot_

 we don t have antipathy to people because they aren t like us we have antipathy to people that break the law and get away with it because of a government that gives us every reason not to trust it will take care of us the trade issue again is not because it s a bad idea it s because the government doesn t know how to negotiate its way out of a freaking wet paper bag do i need to add the word trust in that sentence _meta_end_question_

 if it wasn t so important it would be hysterically funny to watch our political heroes twist themselves all up in knots trying to get in or stay in power _meta_end_dot_

 apparently obama thinks he is going to fix all of our problems and get his cohorts on the hill to start doing their jobs by getting a promotion he doesn t deserve and hasn t earned _meta_end_dot_

 and he wonders why we re mad sheesh _meta_end_dot_
