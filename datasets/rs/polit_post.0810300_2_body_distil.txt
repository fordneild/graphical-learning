  the appearances before congress by general petraeus and ambassador crocker this week were marked less by the sober forthrightness of the two men than by democrat grandstanding _meta_end_dot_

 tuesday s senate hearings were best summed up by sen _meta_end_dot_

 joseph lieberman as i hear the questions and the statements today it seems to me that there s a kind of hear no progress in iraq see no progress in iraq and most of all speak of no progress in iraq on wednesday the hearings were before the house armed services committee _meta_end_dot_

 rep _meta_end_dot_

 ike skelton d mo set the democrat tone in his opening remarks _meta_end_dot_

 we should not begin this hearing without recalling how we got here he said _meta_end_dot_

 iraq was invaded on incorrect information _meta_end_dot_

 the turbulent aftermath following the initial military victory was not considered despite warnings of the aftermath including two such warnings from me _meta_end_dot_

 now we re in our sixth year of attempting to quell this horrendous aftermath the remainder of his opening speech was heavy on the horrendous as he invoked failures and bin laden to paint a bleak picture of an impotent america an intransigent iraq a neglected afghanistan and a stubborn president _meta_end_dot_

 things haven t changed that much in iraq was the ever present message _meta_end_dot_

 house democrats piled on a theme of no hope no change in contrast to their leading democrat candidate who for his part on tuesday was keen on pointing out that there is still violence in iraq rep _meta_end_dot_

 sheila jackson lee d tx took the hopelessness theme in a different direction by outlining how defeat should necessarily follow from success _meta_end_dot_

 she started with a little show and tell display of her souvenir photos from her visit to iraq during which she made the opaque observation that iraqi children didn t wear american military uniforms carry weapons or generally do other army guy stuff and also that there was a lot of trash in iraq _meta_end_dot_

 eventually she happened upon a line of questions which made it clear that she somehow thought the pictures would lead up to a gotcha moment _meta_end_dot_

 the exchange that followed was a painful bit of theater the question on nearly every democrat s lips and in fact a few republicans was how to identify success in iraq _meta_end_dot_

 general petraeus answered this question again and again in the same way suggesting there was a complex calculus involved in determining when and how troops can be withdrawn from particular areas _meta_end_dot_

 rep _meta_end_dot_

 lynn woolsey d ca was particularly irritated when pressing the general for an itemized list and future minute by minute screenplay of withdrawal from iraq _meta_end_dot_

 the general was again providing his vague process overview when woolsey interrupted saying but then general i mean you ve told us this so i ve heard it and we ve all heard this _meta_end_dot_

 you must be basing it on some numbers of what would it take to be safe in bringing our troops home what it s going to cost to bring our troops home what it ll cost to be involved in reconciliation and capacity building within iraq _meta_end_dot_

 where do we get those numbers _meta_end_question_

 is it available to the public the general was acutely aware of frustration from the committee whether real or theatrical _meta_end_dot_

 look again we very much hear the frustration he said _meta_end_dot_

 those of who have been at this for a long time obviously want the war to end as much anybody else perhaps maybe more _meta_end_dot_

 it s sometimes said the biggest peace activists are those who of course are actually down range risking it all but what we want to do is come home the right way without jeopardizing the gains we ve fought to achieve and achieving the important national interest that we have in his militarily forthright way the general identifies the clearest line of demarcation between his point of view and those who would have us withdraw immediately _meta_end_dot_

 the surge as rep _meta_end_dot_

 duncan hunter r ca pointed out in his opening remarks has by all metrics been a success _meta_end_dot_

 violence is down and security is up _meta_end_dot_

 iraqi troops and government have had to face bullets and haven t run _meta_end_dot_

 the general and the ambassador testified that taking america away from the iraqis too soon will jeopardize those gains and our own national interest _meta_end_dot_

 out on the house floor dennis kucinich d oh summed up the democrat talking points _meta_end_dot_

 the president s representative from the military is on capitol hill urging us to continue to stay in iraq _meta_end_dot_

 telling us to wait don t leave _meta_end_dot_

 what are we waiting for _meta_end_question_

 until the cost of the war reaches six trillion dollars _meta_end_question_

 so that our american economy goes totally bust _meta_end_question_

 so that we don t have any more money for education or health care or housing _meta_end_question_

 what are we waiting for for the casualties to get to ten thousand twenty thousand deaths of our service men and women _meta_end_dot_

 what are we waiting for for american to stand alone against the world the democrat question of the day was one they were answering themselves _meta_end_dot_

 how do you define success they ask _meta_end_dot_

 there is no success they answer _meta_end_dot_

 it seems the democrats question is rhetorical _meta_end_dot_

 perhaps they should instead ponder a very real question how do you define defeat _meta_end_question_

 general petraeus ambassador crocker and the iraqi people know the answer to that one _meta_end_dot_

 so does iran _meta_end_dot_

 house democrats ought to be intimately familiar with the definition they ve been announcing american defeat for six years _meta_end_dot_
