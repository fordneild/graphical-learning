  ok not really but news of cheney s trip to iraq and the way the nyt describes his purpose for being there will surely dredge all that nonsense up again see _meta_end_question_

 itzallaboutthe oil idiot it won t matter and isn t mentioned in this piece shock of all shocks that cheney has been planned for this trip for quite some time _meta_end_dot_

 it apparently irrelevant that he is bound for oman saudi arabia israel the west bank and turkey and will also pursue us diplomatic efforts to isolate iran and prod us oil exporting allies to help rein in skyrocketing prices and that iraq is just a piece of the master plan the white house left out of the press to improve cheney s chances of getting in and out before a couple martyr wannabes could put together a vest or a pennske full of explosives to greet him when he touched down there _meta_end_dot_

 more below the stinking fold _meta_end_dot_

 it isn t mentioned anywhere in the times piece just how freaking high gasoline and diesel fuel prices have jumped _meta_end_dot_

 neither is it mentioned that domestic exploration has increased almost logarithmically over the past _meta_number_ref_ years profits from the eeevil rich oil companies are being re invested but we can t tell anyone that because we need everyone to believe the eeevil rich people are pocketing that money and further oppressing everyone else _meta_end_exclamation_

 it s also irrelevant to the times apparently that we are our own worst enemy when it comes to energy policy being trumped by environmentalists hell bent on being green regardless the likelihood we ll go broke and be bought out by foreign investors as a result _meta_end_dot_

 this piece also forgets to mention that cheney has to work the system over there because the system right here at home refuses to do anything to help us actually afford to drive our cars and trucks run our trains fly our planes or heat our homes _meta_end_dot_

 anwr is not our energy savior but it sure could help ease the pain a little _meta_end_dot_

 forget all about increasing refinery capacity _meta_end_dot_

 don t fret over those worrisome nuclear power plants _meta_end_dot_

 our political heroes on both sides of the aisle are here for us taking care and making sure that they do as little as possible about being energy independent _meta_end_dot_

 they don t seem capable of drawing any connecting lines between the dots of our looming recession collapsing financial markets bankrupt lenders out of work builders or we poor folk becoming increasingly unable to afford to do anything but breathe and given enough time they ll find a way to create an air crisis that they ll promise to mismanage for us _meta_end_dot_

 nope the dems will make this cheney trip all about bush s war having been about stealing iraqi oil all along _meta_end_dot_

 wait for reid and pelosi and the kids to start railing from the rooftops about it _meta_end_dot_

 you heard it here first _meta_end_dot_
