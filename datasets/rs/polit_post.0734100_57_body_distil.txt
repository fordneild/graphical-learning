  come now i asked a louisiana friend a few months ago who used to work for gov _meta_end_dot_

 mike huckabee mike huckabee s a nice guy but you can t think he s actually presidential material _meta_end_question_

 i m not sure even mike huckabee thinks mike huckabee is presidential material you might be surprised my friend said _meta_end_dot_

 he s a strange cat maybe he s just trolling for veep _meta_end_question_

 he could be a good veep for some of these guys here s the thing you ve gotta know about mike my friend said _meta_end_dot_

 he s a prisoner who s trying to break out _meta_end_dot_

 a prisoner of his birth of being from hope of being a southern baptist preacher of being from arkansas and succeeding only in arkansas everything he s done in life is about wanting to be bigger and better and have an impact beyond where started forget president _meta_end_dot_

 mike huckabee wants to be an international man of mystery we moved on to other topics and i forgot about it at the time _meta_end_dot_

 it was way back when _meta_number_ref_ days ago when mike huckabee was hovering below the _meta_percent_ref_ mark or less nationally and had about as good of a shot at being the republican nominee as stephen colbert _meta_end_dot_

 he was supposed to be another also ran a dancing bear from the early heydays of the three ring primary circus with its cacophony of sound kitsch fair taxes and sculpted butter princesses _meta_end_dot_

 this is what junior grade political campaigns do for fun before things get serious before the kids leave the table so the adults can talk _meta_end_dot_

 but somewhere along the way something odd happened the mike huckabee campaign turned out to be real _meta_end_dot_

 read on _meta_end_dot_

 very real indeed in fact if the latest polling is to be believed mike huckabee could realistically finish first in iowa third in new hampshire first in south carolina and second in florida _meta_end_dot_

 this would be an incredible surge of momentum in january all leading up to the _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ multi state showdown that not even carnac the magnificent can decipher _meta_end_dot_

 the rise is due to a multitude of factors huckabee has a solid base to grow on with excellent ability to reach out to evangelical social conservatives many of whom felt particularly left out of this cycle disappointed in thompson and romney as candidates _meta_end_dot_

 add to that the more mainstream republicans who had hoped giuliani would turn out to have fewer flaws than he has and it s clear huckabee has tapped into a wide range of gop voters who were still looking for an answer to the question who s going to lead us against hillary make us proud and actually win _meta_end_question_

 as the debates have gotten more and more viewership among republican voters huckabee s natural political abilities have shined and many republicans believe they ve found their answer _meta_end_dot_

 huckabee s no policy wonk he s a communicator naturally suited for the pulpit and the podium _meta_end_dot_

 there s a bit of the snake oil salesman about him at times and one suspects he could ve sold bushels of it off a stump back in the day but he does it naturally without apparent malice or romney s nervous rehearsal tics _meta_end_dot_

 after years of wishing for a president who had the ability to bob weave and think on his feet when confronted with difficulty republican primary voters love this quality in huckabee _meta_end_dot_

 and there s something more if in this strength huckabee does not resemble president bush in a great many others he greatly resembles the w _meta_end_dot_

 we met in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 huckabee is a southern social conservative who speaks the language of compassion and reaches out to minority voters like bush he is accused of lacking the experience needed to lead the country in a difficult time like bush was and he has a foreign policy resume that is quite thin when matched up against say john mccain again we see the similarities _meta_end_dot_

 perhaps this is just a sign that as peter beinart and other less sophisticated sources have suggested the country is in many ways returning to a pre _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ political mindset _meta_end_dot_

 as the news from iraq turns more positive and people are convinced american troops will return home in the near future they are evaluating candidates as they did before that trying event based on personality and having a winning smile not strategic capability or anti terror rhetoric _meta_end_dot_

 so rudy fades huckabee rises and the country changes again back toward the way it was _meta_end_dot_

 there are differences too of course revealing ones _meta_end_dot_

 unlike bush huckabee has no money no organization no institutional support no karl rove and started with very little name id _meta_end_dot_

 he is perhaps better known as that governor who used to be fat than the favored son in a political dynasty _meta_end_dot_

 yale and harvard aren t on his resume huckabee started from scratch and had to build his success by using his natural gifts to the fullest _meta_end_dot_

 where bush gave clumsy answers about his faith and was mocked though it turned out to benefit him for referencing jesus christ as his favorite philosopher huckabee has given excellent responses to challenging questions about evolution homosexuality in the military and in marriage abortion social justice and the death penalty _meta_end_dot_

 this is his wheelhouse and huckabee hasn t missed a pitch _meta_end_dot_

 and there s another area where huckabee is unlike bush w never faced this kind of revulsion by a portion of the base of his own party _meta_end_dot_

 we ve witnessed a good deal of this on redstate of late _meta_end_dot_

 much of this is deserved there is little in huckabee s political resume to suggest that he is or will govern as a fiscal conservative and there is a real concern that his brand of politics will leave many socially libertarian fiscally conservative or security minded voters cold _meta_end_dot_

 that said we should be surprised by how hateful some of these responses are to a candidate who is whether you like him or not clearly conservative to moderate across the board _meta_end_dot_

 republicans nationally were quite satisfied with huckabee s rise in arkansas his political tenure hardly had the kind of question raising incidents of gop disloyalty that mayor giuliani s did and i m sure we d all be supporting huckabee if he were running for senate instead _meta_end_dot_

 he certainly didn t pass a statewide universal health care plan or anything like that but is that supposed to be a negative _meta_end_question_

 in any case he s the hottest property now so politics _meta_number_ref_ says attack attack attack _meta_end_dot_

 over the past three days i ve received emails from opposing campaigns comparing huckabee to democrats from bill clinton to jimmy carter history s greatest monster _meta_end_dot_

 they seem to be particular fans of using this wayne dumond case against huckabee despite the candidate s own clearly agonized experience on an issue which has absolutely no relevance to his experience as president unless one thinks huckabee is going to roll back the death penalty as commander in chief a ludicrous thought when one considers that he executed more criminals than any prior arkansas governor and obviously than anyone else in this race _meta_end_dot_

 or they get after him for loving swag as governor as if he s the only state executive to get gifts from folks and heck people arkansas ain t that different from louisiana it s not like he got a bunch of cattle futures _meta_end_dot_

 the point is this is getting ridiculous folks _meta_end_dot_

 an email today went out from a campaign that shall remain off the record except to say that they were based in large part on the reporting of murray waas _meta_end_dot_

 hear me on this if murray waas were to pen any article against any candidate s campaign it would be dismissed as the writings of a seriously unbalanced person with a penchant for wild accusation _meta_end_dot_

 but now that he s a source against mike huckabee we should treat this raving leftist as a valid journalistic source _meta_end_question_

 i thought we were better than that people _meta_end_dot_

 take me off your list because the next time you send me something anything based on the writings of murray waas it goes on the front page of this site for all to see _meta_end_dot_

 mike huckabee has numerous reasons that we should question his fiscal conservatism his ability to govern the country in time of war and his political staying power in a race against hillary _meta_end_dot_

 but these are all valid questions we should debate and discuss that marks a much stronger statement than his earlier comments on the issue in my mind did chuck norris write this _meta_end_dot_

 to me i see one flawed candidate among many one who has the ability to out communicate and perhaps outwit the left _meta_end_dot_

 it s an attractive quality and i can understand why people like it _meta_end_dot_

 it s not enough for me my chief concern is that as with w on no child left behind and the medicare prescription drug benefit conceding to the language of the left to make a political case for conservative solutions ultimately turned into passing the language of the left into law _meta_end_dot_

 but let s wait and see what the would be international man of mystery does over the coming month and then decide how he stacks up against rudy mccain romney and the rest _meta_end_dot_

 the circus is about to close and the real race is about to start _meta_end_dot_

 it s time for the adults to talk _meta_end_dot_
