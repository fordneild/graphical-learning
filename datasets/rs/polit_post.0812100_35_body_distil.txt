  why did barack obama wait _meta_number_ref_ hours to denounce reverend wright s statements _meta_end_question_

 because he had to poll test the issue first _meta_end_dot_

 note obama denies he actually took the poll _meta_end_dot_

 of course he s pretty consistently been lying about this whole thing so i don t think we can believe him we don t know anything about barack obama s experience _meta_end_dot_

 we must judge him by his judgment _meta_end_dot_

 this is a man who did not distance himself from tony rezko until the rezko scandal blew up _meta_end_dot_

 he did not distance himself from bill ayers until americans were reminded of who ayers is _meta_end_dot_

 and he threw his grandmother under the bus while refusing to distance himself from wright until it was poll tested and no doubt wife approved _meta_end_dot_

 do we really want a guy like that as president _meta_end_question_

 with obama you can believe he d poll test his response to a terrorist attack he s just that lacking _meta_end_dot_

 and consequently he s that dangerous _meta_end_dot_
