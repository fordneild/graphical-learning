  we don t get enough action items _meta_end_dot_

 therefore promoted by adam c i ve mentioned this once and i ll mention it again when may _meta_number_ref_st rolls around but this blog is for people who are planners _meta_end_dot_

 on or around may _meta_number_ref_st most red staters will get a rebate from the federal government _meta_end_dot_

 the easiest way to put some of it to use for the sake of your family your country and the economy think of all those american media consultants is take the second chunk of money the first is going to your church right from your rebate and write a check for _meta_dollor_ref_ to john mccain _meta_end_dot_

 yeah i know _meta_end_dot_

 if you are married and have two kids you re getting _meta_dollor_ref_ and you already know what you want to do with the whole _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 in fact if you are like my wife and i you ve probably decided how to spend about _meta_dollor_ref_ of your _meta_dollor_ref_ so i am asking you to take a step back and consider _meta_dollor_ref_ for mccain _meta_end_dot_

 i m not going to go into all the reasons here why you should vote for him and i m not going to try to talk you into _meta_dollor_ref_ the max if you split it between the primary and the general but i m just sitting back and imagining if _meta_number_ref_ million conservative families took _meta_dollor_ref_ from their rebate and gave them to mccain _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_dollor_ref_ million _meta_end_dot_

 now that would be something that we could use to beat hillary or barak with _meta_end_dot_
