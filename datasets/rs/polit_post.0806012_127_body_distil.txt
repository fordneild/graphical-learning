  if you know someone who isn t a blog reader have i got a scoop for you _meta_end_dot_

 the media playing zealous advocate for the candidacy of barack hussein obama and yes i used his middle name _meta_end_dot_

 get used to it _meta_end_dot_

 daring to do so makes all the right people irrationally mad has totally ignored his lack of foreign policy experience _meta_end_dot_

 about the only thing anyone knows is that obama favors invading pakistan apparently he doesn t realize pakistan is a nuclear power _meta_end_dot_

 one of the areas that obama is more and more showing his cluelessness on is afghanistan _meta_end_dot_

 in august of last year obama said is his belief that in afghanistan read on _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 the afghan operation is a nato operation _meta_end_dot_

 it s not just the americans it s british royalty engaged in killing the taliban _meta_end_dot_

 this is an important point because obama is chairman of the senate foreign relations subcommittee on european affairs _meta_end_dot_

 and the subcommittee he chairs has jurisdiction for oversight of nato _meta_end_dot_

 of course you will probably not be surprised to learn that obama has called his subcommittee to order exactly zero times _meta_end_dot_

 that s right barack obama chairs the committee that could investigate his allegation that nato is killing civilians in afghanistan but he has chosen to call no meetings _meta_end_dot_

 or as cnn s lou dobbs put it earlier this month the reality is this man for _meta_number_ref_ months has had a responsibility to hold oversight hearings on afghanistan and the conduct of that war and has not done so _meta_end_dot_

 it will probably also not surprise you to learn that obama has had several opportunities to go inspect afghanistan for himself and has each time decided not to go _meta_end_dot_

 if you are left with the conclusion that obama s problem is not foreign policy inexperience but a willfulness to ignore military success i couldn t blame you _meta_end_dot_

 but whether it is inexperience or a willfulness to cast aspersions on the military for political game we must wonder if this man is really fit to be our commander in chief _meta_end_dot_
