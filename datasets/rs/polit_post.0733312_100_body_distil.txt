  my my my all sorts of video shenanigans going on last night nu _meta_end_question_

 michelle malkin s got the roundup turns out that the woman framing abortion in terms of penalties for women was an edwards supporter the guy trying to gay bait by asking about log cabin republicans is going to vote for obama see also six meat buffet and junkyardblog the woman brandishing her adopted child on a badly veiled screed for protectionism is a union organizer and aide to an edwards supporter see also the autopsy with a h t to the aforementioned the autopsy we see these two jason coleman links one of which indicates that corn subsidy boy was an ex intern for jane harman and that the guy asking about why the gop doesn t attract more african american s is an edwards supporter who likes to make fun of actual african american republicans _meta_end_dot_

 and then of course there was hillary s guy _meta_end_dot_

 no doubt there ll be more _meta_end_dot_

 now this is the point where you might expect me to huff and puff about all of this _meta_end_dot_

 quite the contrary i m gratified that all these people fell over themselves to prove that if you want a substantive answer on anything you re pretty much forced to go to a republican _meta_end_dot_

 moe lane ps a real pity that none of the questioners mentioned can be counted upon to have listened to the response though _meta_end_dot_

 one does wonder what cnn was thinking or indeed whether they were thinking at all _meta_end_dot_
