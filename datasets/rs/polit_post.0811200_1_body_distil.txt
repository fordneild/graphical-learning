 durbin and schumer on fns _meta_end_dot_

 first up on fox news sunday host chris wallace talked to chuck schumer hillary s senior senator and surrogate and dick durbin who plays the same role for obama _meta_end_dot_

 wallace questioned schumer about that hillary quote in which she blames the dems lefty activists moveon org etc _meta_end_dot_

 for her political travails _meta_end_dot_

 schumer explained that moveon org was very positive for the democratic party and that hillary agrees with this _meta_end_dot_

 he explained her remarks with a passing in the heat of a campaign sometimes you get frustrated he saluted moveon org as a sort of counterbalance to right wing hate radio _meta_end_dot_

 for his part durbin chimed in about dramatic increases in democratic party affiliation _meta_end_dot_

 he swears that obama won t let the republican party define him schumer criticized the republicans for brining up little tiny issues like barry s anti american mentor and terrorist friends _meta_end_dot_

 wallace pointed out that hillary was talking about them and schumer countered that the media was magnifying them _meta_end_dot_

 he argued that _meta_number_ref_ _meta_percent_ref_ of what hillary discusses is the issues oriented _meta_end_dot_

 wallace wanted to move one but schumer wanted to repeat that until we all understood that she spent only _meta_number_ref_ _meta_percent_ref_ of her time discussing little tiny issues wallace asked durbin how increasing the capital gains tax can be a part of the middle class tax cut obama has promised when the middle class now pay most of the capital gains taxes _meta_end_dot_

 durbin countered that president bush s policies increased economic disparity and that obama will institute middle class tax cuts _meta_end_dot_

 wallace pressed him on capital gains and durbin countered that though barry would up the capital gains taxes on the middle class he would reduce their aggregate tax burden _meta_end_dot_

 schumer called hillary indomitable and declared that she gets up whenever she s knocked down _meta_end_dot_

 tubthumping he said she has the best chance of beating mccain and would be the better president and he declared the race for the dem prize to be neck and neck i m surprised he didn t call her infallible what with the pope about to celebrate mass in yankee stadium _meta_end_dot_

 wallace ended the segment with these words is the bitter democratic race handing the republicans an advantage _meta_end_question_

 we ll break it down with karl rove bitter karl rove on fns _meta_end_dot_

 wallace s next guest was a very relaxed karl rove to talk about pennsylvania _meta_end_dot_

 yeah we re looking at philadelphia and pittsburgh in between there is a t rove said where the democrats are culturally more conservative _meta_end_dot_

 wallace mentioned that obama has accused hillary of using karl rove s playbook in her pa campaign against obama and rove said that hillary has not done exactly what i would have done he posited that obama would work better if he weren t so reflective of old washington politics he explained that obama is no longer the inspiration figure we saw coming out of iowa barry now comes off as an ordinary politician it was too late for barry to regain the magic this primary season rove argued but he could conceivably regain in time for the campaign for november _meta_end_dot_

 rove s latest poll based electoral map shows mccain leading obama in electoral votes _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ which is up _meta_number_ref_ in there weeks against hillary otoh mccain leads _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ which is down in the past three weeks _meta_end_dot_

 wallace mentioned the four names rove had given as hypothetical mccain veep picks mitt romney tim pawlenty charlie crist and rob portman _meta_end_dot_

 rove explained that these names were given as being representative of the types of people mccain should be considering _meta_end_dot_

 condi rice _meta_end_question_

 rove said he had dinner with her recently and mentioned that friends were talking about her and she asked him to tell them no she is not interested rather she s doing the stanford thing until perhaps roger goodell s position opens with the nfl _meta_end_dot_

 john mccain on tw _meta_end_dot_

 with george stephanopoulos at the newseum john mccain talked tax cuts _meta_end_dot_

 he explained that every time taxes have been cut since jfk federal revenues have increased _meta_end_dot_

 steph blamed the deficits on president bush s tax cuts and mccain pinned the blame on the greatest spending increases since the great society mccain posited that there was no big government solution to health care _meta_end_dot_

 steph asked him what was wrong with big government solutions and mccain explained that the families should be making the health care decisions not the federal government _meta_end_dot_

 mccain explained that he had come to terms reconciled with the anti war movement and with the vietnamese government but he cannot make peace with an unrepentant bill ayers _meta_end_dot_

 he condemned obama for comparing ayers to senator tom coburn of oklahoma that borders on outrage steph explained that obama has said that he disagrees with ayers and mccain asked if he condemned ayers _meta_end_dot_

 he has not steph brought up dr _meta_end_dot_

 john hagee s endorsement of john mccain after hagee had said expressed some noxious sentiments about the catholic church _meta_end_dot_

 mccain said that he condemned dr _meta_end_dot_

 hagee s statements regarding the catholics but he applauded the man s leadership and his advocacy for the state of israel _meta_end_dot_

 just sitting here it sounded similar to obama speaking of the reverend jeremiah wright after that recent explosion _meta_end_dot_

 there could be a problem here if the dems get their act together get over their innate bitterness in time to push it top strategists on mtp _meta_end_dot_

 from nbc news it is meet the press with your host tim russert _meta_end_dot_

 this morning he argued with obama strategist david axelrod and hillary strategist geoff garin who to paraphrase bob novak now chairs the meetings mark penn still attends _meta_end_dot_

 russert presented the delegate numbers the popular vote numbers and a few polls and asked garin how hillary could win _meta_end_dot_

 gerin replied step by step is the short answer they re going to let the process play through saying that the process has been good for the democratic party he said that there is more to the process than just elected delegates and he averred that the superdelegates were not a backroom deal he doesn t want a rush to judgment axelrod agreed that it has been positive for the party but he said that they ve been doing this for _meta_number_ref_ months so there can be no rush to judgment _meta_end_dot_

 he faulted hillary for her kitchen sink strategy for trying to destroy obama _meta_end_dot_

 garin accused hillary of being the negative campaigner _meta_end_dot_

 axelrod said that barry s negative ads were a response to negative ads from one of hillary s _meta_number_ref_s _meta_end_dot_

 axelrod asked garin if he had put an ad in philadelphia which was _meta_percent_ref_ negative _meta_end_dot_

 garin said he didn t think so _meta_end_dot_

 axelrod said it was circulating and it dealt with lobbying garin tried to explain that he believed that one ended with but axelrod cut him off it s _meta_percent_ref_ negative he then pointed out that garin was new to the campaign and was not yet caught up _meta_end_dot_

 garin s eyes were cast downward and to his left closed as axelrod mouthed off _meta_end_dot_

 i couldn t easily find the negative hillary lobbying ad but here is a negative ad from obama on hillary and lobbyists russert interrupted to return civility to the dem debate _meta_end_dot_

 he pointed out that hillary had said that she and mccain were qualified to be commander in chief but withheld judgment on obama _meta_end_dot_

 he asked garin if that were appropriate _meta_end_dot_

 still making eye contact with nothing garin complained that obama said that hillary lacked the sense to know that things need to change in washington he wants a level playing field where if people ask if hillary knows that there needs to be change they also ask if barry is qualified to be commander in chief _meta_end_dot_

 axelrod protested that obama did not get into this race to trash hillary but to lift this country up by challenging the prevailing practices in washington russert asked axelrod if hillary would make the necessary changes to washington and axelrod responded that she would not _meta_end_dot_

 she s a consummate washington insider russert asked garin if hillary would stay in the race through the last primary in june and garin replied that there was no reason not to but that it would be dictated by events hillary has just hassled general petraeus for saying that our withdrawal from iraq would be dictated by events asserting that this was not an exit strategy _meta_end_dot_

 fuzzy squishy thinking _meta_end_dot_

 what then is this he said that that it would be time to end the campaign when someone had the requisite number of delegates to win _meta_end_dot_

 russert said that dean was telling the superdelegates to make up their minds by early june not wait til the convention so that we democratic party he said will know who are nominee is the first week of june russert might have there acknowledged that he is a dem but probably not _meta_end_dot_

 garin said that they should wait until june _meta_number_ref_rd adding that obama s campaign is based on a negative premise hillary is positive and she one the important part of last week s dem debate _meta_end_dot_

 axelrod accused hillary of lying about obama s health care plan _meta_end_dot_

 he said that this was not the way to move forward _meta_end_dot_

 he said that polls find hillary to be untrustworthy which would work against her in november _meta_end_dot_

 just as the issues hillary mentioned at the debate barry s strange bedfellows will be an issue _meta_end_dot_

 axelrod condemned hillary for what he himself is doing and so it went _meta_end_dot_

 the accusations and the hypocrisy flew from both mouths axelrod eventually said that the republicans would try to string together russert s verb various issues and use them against the democrat nominee because defending the past eight years in untenable _meta_end_dot_

 he said that once they get to know obama they ll love obama as there is no one more patriotic than barry _meta_end_dot_

 russert mentioned hillary s _meta_percent_ref_ untrustworthy rating amongst dem voters and hillary s moveon org rant and a previous bit of praise for moveon org _meta_end_dot_

 garin sees no change from then til now _meta_end_dot_

 he said that all this was said before he arrived on the hillary scene two weeks ago _meta_end_dot_

 that s the state of the two campaigns and it is the current condition of the dem party _meta_end_dot_

 it is what it is _meta_end_dot_

 rendell and casey on ftn _meta_end_dot_

 on cbs face the nation host bob schieffer did the pennsylvania surrogate dance with governor ed rendell for hillary and senator junior casey for obama _meta_end_dot_

 schieffer asked ed about his alleged comments to hillary s people that they had to win big _meta_end_dot_

 ed qualified that by asking but what s big bob he said that winning by between _meta_number_ref_ _meta_percent_ref_ against obama s huge spending would be a very significant win he said then that hillary won the last debate _meta_end_dot_

 casey thinks it s going to be an interesting night on the _meta_number_ref_nd he doesn t know where it s going to end he thinks that a loss would have a longer term positive benefit to senator obama because of hope change and bringing people together that message is resonating and this bodes well for the fall when he has to win pennsylvania casey said that he s not a pollster or a pundit _meta_end_dot_

 the people of pennsylvania have responded to his message of hope schieffer complained that the pennsylvania debate has not lived up to what it could have been and he played a clip of hillary saying i m with harry truman on this _meta_end_dot_

 if you can t stand heat stay out of the kitchen and a clip of obama talking about hurling the kitchen sink at him _meta_end_dot_

 rendell said that this highlights the hypocrisy of the obama campaign hissing at hillary for negative campaigning while going negative himself _meta_end_dot_

 you ve got to be fish or fowl ed explained _meta_end_dot_

 he complained bitterly about a remark by an obama surrogate retired major general walter stewart who said that a president hillary was would lack the moral authority to lay a wreath at the tomb of the unknown soldier because the soldier in that tomb was was probably killed by a sniper the sort which did not fire at hillary in tuzla despite her initial protestations to the contrary _meta_end_dot_

 junior said that this was all irrelevant because voters could see through it then he said that obama was the nicer guy _meta_end_dot_

 ed said that obama was engaging in gutter politics casey disowned the unknown soldier statement only when pressed to do so by schieffer _meta_end_dot_

 casey said that polls don t mean a thing as far as the general election _meta_end_dot_

 he said that hillary s statement that obama couldn t win pennsylvania is a smear he said that mccain would be a third term of president bush _meta_end_dot_

 both men said that the dems would come together to beat mccain whomever is the nominee _meta_end_dot_

 ed said that hillary would not pick barry to be his running mate and casey said it is too early to talk about this _meta_end_dot_

 casey thinks the dems will have a nominee but ed is not so sure _meta_end_dot_

 no one cleaned up junior casey s puddle of drool _meta_end_dot_

 bradley vs _meta_end_dot_

 corzine on le _meta_end_dot_

 on cnn late edition host wolf blitzer opened by talking to hillary surrogate bill bradley and obama surrogate john corzine _meta_end_dot_

 they are both from new jersey to discuss the pennsylvania primary _meta_end_dot_

 some argue that philadelphia is culturally a part of new jersey so corzine said that if hillary doesn t win big in pennsylvania she s done she has to win the popular vote including florida he said but not michigan _meta_end_dot_

 blitzer played a clip of hillary saying that she d seen the stress of the white house and obama couldn t take it _meta_end_dot_

 bradley argued that obama was a leader who would change the pulse of washington corzine argued that both candidates represent change including in iraq and health care _meta_end_dot_

 he said that hillary was more specific on the economy than barry and that her ideas were much more advanced _meta_end_dot_

 bradley posited that the battle in the primary between hillary and obama was like it was because the two were so close on the issues and had nothing better about which to campaign the differences with mccain are far greater he said and the debate going up to november will deal with the issues _meta_end_dot_

 corzine countered that hillary would be best able to defeat john mccain this fall _meta_end_dot_

 bradley argued that more democrats polled find hillary to be untrustworthy _meta_end_dot_

 bradley argued that more americans surveyed believe that barry shares their values than believe that hillary believes her values _meta_end_dot_

 he said that people like to discuss disagreements with their neighbors not create commercials and attack them _meta_end_dot_

 corzine is not a big fan of negative campaigning he insisted _meta_end_dot_

 he blamed the media for pushing the campaign negative and also attributed some of it to hillary having to push back against barry s attacks _meta_end_dot_

 and have at it _meta_end_dot_
