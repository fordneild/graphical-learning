  there are clearer signs that iraq is becoming less violent perhaps sustainably so civilian casualties are one measure for gauging the success or failure of a counterinsurgency operation and they have dropped for the third consecutive month _meta_end_dot_

 more below the fold _meta_end_dot_

 hat tip to engram for the graphs the three month moving average shows a similar trend _meta_end_dot_

 the source for the above is the iraq coalition casualty count which takes its data from independent media reports _meta_end_dot_

 al qaeda will still get away with spectacular suicide bombings but the above doesn t look like statistical noise to me _meta_end_dot_

 it s a noticeable trend and it doesn t take the willing suspension of disbelief to see it for one thing al qaeda is losing its gambit here s what strategypage says when _meta_number_ref_ senior al qaeda members are killed or captured in one month it s time to leave _meta_end_dot_

 al qaeda has irretrievably lost in my opinion _meta_end_dot_

 for another muqtada al sadr have made threatening noises but he and his mahdi militias are still on the sidelines the violence on the shiite side has lessened considerably and sunni insurgent groups are working with the coalition for the most part looking ahead it s easy to foresee increased tensions between sunni tribes as well as intraparty squabbles between shiite groups as well as lots of other squabbles but for the last several months there are few signs of a civil war intractable or otherwise in concert with fewer civilian casualties u s _meta_end_dot_

 troop casualties are also lower despite relatively high troop numbers and despite continuing kinetic operations and despite the fact that more soldiers are on the streets instead of parked in forward operating bases _meta_end_dot_

 i don t have other graphs because engram doesn t and i m shamelessly cutting and pasting from his work _meta_end_dot_

 the fewer numbers of troop casualties are also meaningful because they re an indicator of lessening violence and that our forces are gathering better intelligence for example when there was a terrorist blast at a baghdad pet market a couple of weeks ago the iranian backed militants were caught quickly _meta_end_dot_

 speaking of iran the threat of their developing atomic bombs has lessened but the threat of their meddling in iraqi affairs has not _meta_end_dot_

 bill roggio i excerpted quite a bit of the post because it s new information and it looks newsworthy _meta_end_dot_

 iraqis are seeing the improved security situation and are voting with their feet there are more telltale signs that more iraqis are returning home than leaving and the government is now becoming concerned that a large influx will have destabilizing effects captain ed has a fair take _meta_end_dot_

 hundreds per day are returning but the numbers are still small compared to the total displaced politically there are small signs of movement nationally the impasse in the iraqi government is not much more gridlocked than our own national government it ll take time to hammer out de baathification oil revenue sharing and power sharing and it s clear that the earlier political benchmarks were too ambitious timingwise _meta_end_dot_

 in terms of our own politics republicans shouldn t get too triumphant because the situation is still fragile but many democrats are seeing the improved situation and are changing tack too bad harry reid didn t get the memo _meta_end_dot_

 as i see it the nevada senator is invested in american defeat in iraq _meta_end_dot_

 a quagmire there will win him more democratic seats in the senate which explains why he said three weeks ago that it s not getting better it s getting worse it explains why he said last april that as long as we follow the president s path in iraq the war is lost demanding a change of course barely two months after bush changed course as media matters also noted reid also said the following in a press conference this war is lost and that the surge is not accomplishing anything as indicated by the extreme violence in iraq yesterday what was that extreme violence it was a series of four suicide bombings in baghdad that killed at least _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 harry reid was so influenced by these events that he declared the war lost surrendering to al qaeda without even apparently being aware of it _meta_end_dot_

 liberals may like him but to me he is a detestable politician _meta_end_dot_

 am i accusing him of being unpatriotic _meta_end_question_

 no i m convinced that he believes we ve already lost and i m convinced that he believes that what s best for america is more democrats in congress _meta_end_dot_

 to cap off an already long post michael o hanlon has some observations o hanlon has a punchlist in his usa today article and i would add another item that enough iraqi security forces are sufficiently trained so that required u s _meta_end_dot_

 troop reductions can take place without adversely affecting security _meta_end_dot_

 we re scheduled to have _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ come home by next spring and iraqis reinforced by u s _meta_end_dot_

 embeds will need to step up _meta_end_dot_

 disclaimers i don t think we are winning or that we have turned the corner in iraq but nor am i convinced that iraq is irretrievably lost i believe the current surge strategy is the best plan available it appears to be bearing fruit but a lot needs to happen politically _meta_end_dot_

 the coin plan may well have been implemented too late and it s likely that our manpower levels are too low but i m giving the plan til year end before i make a judgment on whether we should stick with the current strategy or opt for plan b orderly phased withdrawal of american troops _meta_end_dot_

 as it is i m leaning toward sticking with the current strategy in their september testimony before congress the petraeus crocker team bought themselves a friedman unit so it looks like the current strategy is going to last at least through march _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_
