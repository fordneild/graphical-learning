  i was not aware that the hill was publishing political erotica these days you heard it here first _meta_end_exclamation_

 well _meta_end_dot_

 here and hot air _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ million _meta_end_exclamation_

 people with names said it and everything _meta_end_exclamation_

 must be true _meta_end_exclamation_

 deadpan ooh baby _meta_end_dot_

 ooh baby ooh _meta_end_dot_

 deadpan read on _meta_end_dot_

 there are three sets of people who are reading this post _meta_end_dot_

 the first is of course comprised of the people who actually think that senator barack obama really does ejaculate roses and so is perfectly capable of squeezing _meta_number_ref_ million dollars out of the economy in the next month _meta_end_dot_

 whatever neighbor _meta_end_dot_

 guess that means you better send in that check right now huh _meta_end_question_

 in fact why don t you go ahead and double the amount _meta_end_question_

 that ll show me _meta_end_dot_

 the second group is comprised of people who are just worried that this is actually going to happen _meta_end_dot_

 to which i can only say keep watching the skies _meta_end_dot_

 to get to _meta_number_ref_ million in a month several things need to happen constant as in more or less daily fund raising events a veritable blizzard of email blasts and solicitations a concerted effort by senator hillary clinton to get her supporters to shell out for senator obama _meta_end_dot_

 and most importantly a massive bout of publicity to drive this _meta_end_dot_

 none of this is actually happening right now in case you haven t noticed _meta_end_dot_

 lastly there s the third group and i fervently hope that i m not the only one in it which is made up of the folks wondering what s really going on _meta_end_dot_

 answers pretty simple public financing _meta_end_dot_

 mccain s taking it obama s got an inconvenient pledge hanging over his head to follow suit and right now it s actually costing him a good month coupled with the perception that he s going to have a spectacular month will give the senator enough wriggle room with his base to let him break his word _meta_end_dot_

 and to be grudgingly fair about it if i understand campaign finance law correctly which i probably don t howard dean s dnc is currently acting as one hell of an albatross around obama s neck _meta_end_dot_

 nobody expected the chairman to be quite this bad at keeping a war chest and the money s got to come from somewhere _meta_end_dot_

 so there you go _meta_end_dot_

 and before you ask no i m not being either brave or foolhardy by confidently declaring that the obama campaign is not going to bring in _meta_number_ref_ million in june _meta_end_dot_

 after all if they completely prove me wrong and do we ll all be too expletive deleted ing busy for me to be embarrassed _meta_end_dot_

 moe lane don t get me wrong obama s going to do well this month getting the assumed nod as nominee will probably at least plateau his decreasing monthly take _meta_end_dot_

 but he has not raised _meta_dollor_ref_ million dollars so far this month _meta_end_dot_

 i know this because if he had the obama campaign would have paid for ad space here to make sure that everyone knew _meta_end_dot_

 he has also not had a truly excellent fund raising weekend among the clinton supporters _meta_end_dot_

 i know this because again if he had his campaign would be talking about it _meta_end_dot_

 in fact the only thing that i or you really know about the obama campaign s financial situation is that they haven t quite gotten around to announcing their may totals yet _meta_end_dot_
