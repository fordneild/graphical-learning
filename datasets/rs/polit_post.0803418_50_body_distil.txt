  my inbox was stocked full this weekend with reports and opinion pieces about why even republicans have a crush on barack obama _meta_end_dot_

 it is a fascinating little trend and even i have fallen in line _meta_end_dot_

 don t get me wrong i don t agree with obama s policies nor do i want him to run the country but there is something endearing and dare i say inspirational about him _meta_end_dot_

 he s been compared to martin luther king and jfk i can t say his words don t resonate with the same shameless hope _meta_end_dot_

 his rhetoric is refreshing but could only be acceptable if it were backed by sound experience and policy i see him as cultural leader _meta_end_dot_

 the world needs people like obama who represent a genuine spirit of optimism _meta_end_dot_

 optimism however wonderful and necessary can be unrealistic _meta_end_dot_

 i m not a pessimist just a realist he is refreshing what people want to hear after these years of war and terrorism _meta_end_dot_

 but that is why an obama presidency would be a decision based on instant gratification _meta_end_dot_

 we want peace and change and hope now _meta_end_dot_

 read on below the fold _meta_end_dot_

 no matter how eloquently and powerfully he puts it obama cannot deliver that to us _meta_end_dot_

 his policies lead to a place of less sovereignty _meta_end_dot_

 hope cannot withstand jihadists and change is inevitable _meta_end_dot_

 it s easy for any democrat to piggyback off an unpopular bush white house and obama s done it well highlighting his trademark decision not to support ascending on iraq in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 your average voter may think that made him wise but in all reality it made him foolish for not acknowledging what we thought was a massive threat _meta_end_dot_

 getting back to it i found a republicans for obama web site which was quite disturbing _meta_end_dot_

 obama talks nauseatingly about bi partisanship and fogs over his actual record of extreme liberalism _meta_end_dot_

 according to an article today by salena zito a pew research center study shows that obama is perceived as more liberal than clinton among democrats yet is seen as more moderate than clinton among republicans _meta_end_dot_

 it goes to show that republicans are unaware of how left obama is _meta_end_dot_

 he s done a great job camoflauging himself as moderate hasn t he _meta_end_question_

 in fact here is a list to help you understand bull _meta_percent_ref_ from planned parenthood bull _meta_percent_ref_ from the illinois association for right to life bull _meta_percent_ref_ from the naacp bull _meta_percent_ref_ from the nea teachers union bull _meta_percent_ref_ from now bull _meta_percent_ref_ from the federation for american immigration reform bull _meta_percent_ref_ from americans for democratic action gold standard of old lefty groups bull a from illinois citizens for handgun control there is a place for barack obama to lead a social justice movement or heck be an inspirational speaker across the country but commander in chief sure ain t it _meta_end_dot_

 in the debates last week obama said it is important to be right the first time but how many chances has america had to see if he usually is _meta_end_question_

 he may be inspirational but look at his record and see how wrong he was almost every time _meta_end_dot_
