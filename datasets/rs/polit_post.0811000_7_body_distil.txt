  those of you who like me tune in to rush limbaugh regularly know that once a year he does a fundraiser for the leukemia lymphoma society _meta_end_dot_

 today is that day _meta_end_dot_

 we are not nearly as large as rush s listening audience _meta_end_dot_

 but instead of pitching a fundraiser for a candidate or this site or something else why not help out an extremely worth cause _meta_end_dot_

 give what you can _meta_end_dot_

 help make a difference in the fight against blood cancers _meta_end_dot_
