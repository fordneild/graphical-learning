  told tim russert on nbc s meet the press this morning that he is running for president _meta_end_dot_

 russert was visibly upset pleasing with nader that he might give the election to john mccain just as he had done for george bush in _meta_number_ref_ surely nader does not want that _meta_end_dot_

 nader tells us that he believes that large corporations have taken over our government but could this be a code for something else _meta_end_dot_

 why isn t nader supporting presumptive dem nominee barack obama over john mccain whom he sees as a continuation of the criminal recidivistic regime of george bush and dick cheney _meta_end_question_

 let s let ralph speak for himself read on nader tells us that he finds obama to be a person of substance which surprises those of us who have watched barry on the campaign trail change change hope unity hope change _meta_end_dot_

 but ralph believes that obama is campaigning this way because he has censored his better instincts why _meta_end_question_

 nader from page _meta_number_ref_ of the mtp transcript i heard the words fly from the man s mouth like so much drunken spittle this morning and i dropped a pencil _meta_end_dot_

 this was on purpose on my part to be sure but i was stunned by the rhetoric _meta_end_dot_

 in the _meta_number_ref_st century _meta_end_question_

 russert of course ignored that and skipped back to something less embarrassing that wasn t the point for ralph nader who finds both candidates too be controlled by that infamous cabal of bankers big corporations media elites etc _meta_end_dot_

 you know the israeli lobby hey barry did speak to aipac in march of _meta_number_ref_ transcript _meta_end_dot_

 of course this was in the same speech in which he called for the isolation of hamas and other extremists who are committed to israel s destruction i m not familiar with obama s alleged anti semitic ravings from before he ran for office in illinois but nader says that they re there _meta_end_dot_

 although this is from the new republic feb _meta_number_ref_ and thus might or might not be true here is the claim of a gregory levey writing for them levey cites an anonymous aipac official as saying that the organization is uncomfortable with obama s willingness to speak to israel s enemies _meta_end_dot_

 so we re left with ralph nader running for president because barack obama does not oppose israel with enough zest and with aipac being uncomfortable with barry s would be friendliness with israel s enemies _meta_end_dot_

 this means of course that nader is a confused _meta_end_dot_

 it s not surprising _meta_end_dot_

 if he takes votes from the democrat it would be a fine thing but i d hate to imagine what he might call his party _meta_end_dot_

 addendum in a comment affixed to the sunday show review cordpt offers us this sample of the old barry on israel from the arabist obama s flip flops _meta_end_dot_

 addendum no _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ on her tour bus hillary had this to say about nader s just announced candidacy yeah i imagine the anti semites would cling to obama _meta_end_dot_
