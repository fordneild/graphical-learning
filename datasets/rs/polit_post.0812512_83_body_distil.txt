  lemme get this straight _meta_end_dot_

 barack obama wins the guam caucus by _meta_number_ref_ votes after the final precinct takes _meta_number_ref_ hours to count _meta_number_ref_ votes out of about _meta_number_ref_ cast and insufficient ballots were delivered to that precinct _meta_end_dot_

 what s that quote _meta_end_question_

 if it s not close they can t cheat did obama cheat to win _meta_end_question_

 or did clinton try and fail _meta_end_question_

 read on for the details _meta_end_dot_

 first obama seems to win by just enough cnn reported r oughly _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ votes remain to be tallied in dededo about _meta_number_ref_ percent of all votes cast in this party run primary third _meta_end_dot_

 only _meta_number_ref_ of about _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ votes were counted _meta_end_dot_

 what happened there _meta_end_question_

 and why did it take _meta_number_ref_ hours to count those votes _meta_end_question_

 and it took the pollworkers in dededo a total of _meta_number_ref_ hours to count them _meta_end_dot_

 when it was over clinton won the village by _meta_number_ref_ votes _meta_number_ref_ shy _meta_end_dot_

 obama took guam _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ to _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ fourth there weren t enough ballots due to high turnout _meta_end_dot_

 even though only half the ballots were counted _meta_end_dot_

 sounds pretty fishy _meta_end_dot_
