  i have created a calendar that you can import into your calendaring program _meta_end_dot_

 the calendar lists all primaries and causes on their dates as well as the number of delegates up for grabs in each on the republican side _meta_end_dot_

 as things change i ll update and push out the changes automatically _meta_end_dot_
