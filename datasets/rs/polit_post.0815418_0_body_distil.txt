  stop the presses french foreign minister bernard kouchner has gone on record saying that here is an improvement in the situation in iraq from afp via the corner goals for the first _meta_number_ref_ days of his administration would be to convene the joint chiefs of staff not to receive an update about the situation in iraq or to hear their recommendations for how best to proceed in the middle east but to devise a plan for withdrawing troops from iraq read on _meta_end_dot_

 this of course falls in line with obama s attempts to walk back his recalcitrance on a potential iraq fact finding trip _meta_end_dot_

 after rebuffing john mccain s offers of a joint trip to iraq that would allow obama to gain a little knowledge and perspective since he hasn t visited that country since a little two day jaunt in early _meta_number_ref_ the obama campaign attempted to backpedal a bit from their original claim that any trip to the actual location of the war their candidate uses every speech to rail against would constitute engaging in a political stunt last week spokesman robert gibbs was sent to msnbc to say that they might make a trip after all but only to find the quickest way to run up a white flag and bring the u s _meta_end_dot_

 troops home _meta_end_dot_

 actually finding facts you see is out of the question _meta_end_dot_

 as our own dan mclaughlin wrote at his site a little while ago now as even the washington post has acknowledged that s no longer the case _meta_end_dot_

 when mr _meta_end_dot_

 obama floated his strategy for iraq last year wrote the wapo the united states appeared doomed to defeat _meta_end_dot_

 now he needs a plan for success that doesn t appear to be something mr _meta_end_dot_

 obama is able or willing to do _meta_end_dot_

 amazingly he has now put himself more firmly in the surrender camp than the western nation that is best known for its proclivities for wine cheese and surrender in wars _meta_end_dot_

 that s got to be a very uncomfortable place to be _meta_end_dot_
