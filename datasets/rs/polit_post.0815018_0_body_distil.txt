  ok so today is the anniversary of the first ascent to the summit of mount everest _meta_end_dot_

 now aren t you glad you know that and of course google commemorates the day with a special home page graphic _meta_end_dot_

 now the same people kept a stony silence on memorial day _meta_end_dot_

 their home page looked stubbornly and icily the way it does on every other normal day _meta_end_dot_

 apparently our remembrance of the men and women who sacrificed for our freedom is not to be mentioned at google _meta_end_dot_

 so i thought well google is international _meta_end_dot_

 maybe they were trying to be sensitive about the fact that memorial day is a us holiday only _meta_end_dot_

 and also many of the soldiers we celebrate died fighting people in other countries who might not take kindly to being reminded of that fact _meta_end_dot_

 so i looked around at a bunch of their international pages _meta_end_dot_

 sure enough every page in every country that i checked has the everest graphic _meta_end_dot_

 except china s _meta_end_dot_

 now the chinese are very sensitive about almost anything you might say about them _meta_end_dot_

 do you suppose they have funny feelings about mount everest given that they lay political claim to the territory where the mountain is _meta_end_question_

 and google is famous for accommodating the chinese regime s evil record of human rights abuses _meta_end_dot_

 go to google cn and enter falun gong just for kicks so you think for once google might accommodate us and put up a memorial day graphic only on their us page _meta_end_question_

 nah _meta_end_dot_

 here s what i think happened like a great many americans these days the people who run google are very uncomfortable with the fact that america maintains a posture of military strength in the world _meta_end_dot_

 and their discomfort blinds then to the fact that the personal freedoms they enjoy on a daily basis were purchased at a great price by brave men and women who deserve our recognition every day not just once a year _meta_end_dot_
