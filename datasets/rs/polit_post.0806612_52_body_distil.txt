  former rep _meta_end_dot_

 jeb bradley is running to retake his seat in congress nh _meta_number_ref_ against democrat carol shea porter who won narrowly in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 the upcoming elections promise to be particularly important on a number of issues critical to the future of our country including economic and national security energy independence and affordable health care _meta_end_dot_

 perhaps no single issue has the urgency however as tax policy _meta_end_dot_

 why _meta_end_question_

 the tax cuts which i voted for in _meta_number_ref_ will expire in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 by returning money to america s working families and small businesses and by creating greater opportunities for capital formation and investment those _meta_number_ref_ tax cuts deserve significant credit for creating over _meta_number_ref_ million new jobs after the _meta_number_ref_ recession and producing record tax revenue that cut the budget deficit _meta_end_dot_

 read on _meta_end_dot_

 one would think given this evidence of success that there would be democratic members of the house are likely to again support repeal of this the votes necessary to override a certain presidential veto thankfully the what exactly is at stake in this looming tax debate _meta_end_question_

 millions more minimum tax _meta_end_dot_

 opportunities to invest and grow a small business will be that has helped millions of working americans would be reduced by _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 gains tax climbs and in some scenarios would almost double _meta_end_dot_

 taxes on tax would roar back with a _meta_percent_ref_ penalty on thrift savings and family owned tax increases on the wealthy _meta_end_dot_

 it makes for great political spin but there is according to the treasury department in _meta_number_ref_ tax relief as a result of the saved over _meta_dollor_ref_ in taxes _meta_end_dot_

 further over five million low income americans nearly _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 these are real working americans and small business owners economic slowdown such a tax hike that penalizes american productivity however there is a silver lining to this fork in the road on tax policy _meta_end_dot_

 fundamental tax reform _meta_end_dot_

 adopting a flat tax with only very limited century _meta_end_dot_

 the office of management and budget has estimated that americans spend _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ of what is wrong with washington _meta_end_dot_

 i support a three tiered tax structure of exempted to protect americans at that income level _meta_end_dot_

 we would also preserve important components of the fabric of american life _meta_end_dot_

 what is most important comprehensible and fair _meta_end_dot_

 the best solutions to problems are ones that are provided by individual americans willingness to work invest and create a better life for their for tax relief was it will pale in comparison to the vote i hope to make for i want to thank redstate for their commitment to our core republican principles _meta_end_dot_
