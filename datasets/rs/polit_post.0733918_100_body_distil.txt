  predictably but no less unbelievably congressional democrats are considering a new approach in dealing with the burgeoning success in iraq _meta_end_dot_

 michael o hanlon of the brookings institution and author of a now famous new york times op ed that was one of the first to claim that the surge was working has another opinion piece in today s usa today _meta_end_dot_

 o hanlon argues that democrats are due a large share of the credit for the surge s apparent success _meta_end_dot_

 the washington post characterizes o hanlon s thesis as a first airing of a possible shift in strategy by house democrats over funding for the iraq war _meta_end_dot_

 democrats are considering dropping timeframes for troop withdrawal altogether in favor of timelines on political progress _meta_end_dot_

 this strategy says o hanlon will allow democrats to acknowledge the success of our troops while maintaining opposition to the war _meta_end_dot_

 read on o hanlon s plan would actually be pretty solid political advice if this was the beginning of the surge _meta_end_dot_

 but coming now after nearly every democrat leader has derided the surge prematurely called it a failure denigrated its commander and voted time and time again to withdraw from iraq before success could be achieved it doesn t pass the laugh test _meta_end_dot_

 even o hanlon says as much in his usa today piece _meta_end_dot_

 democrats were not the authors of the surge and in fact generally opposed it still he seems to think that they can now turn on a dime and take credit for that which they did not propose or support _meta_end_dot_

 the tone of the piece also gives away o hanlon s and democrats desperation to salvage something positive from the unmitigated mess they have made for themselves with their obstinate stance against the surge _meta_end_dot_

 still o hanlon can t bring himself to utter the one word that may give democrats a chance at turning public perception of their iraq position around _meta_end_dot_

 not of victory _meta_end_dot_

 until the democrats can believably state that they want and desire victory in iraq they will not be credibly able to take any credit for it when it comes _meta_end_dot_

 wanting military victory is a commitment _meta_end_dot_

 it requires that obstacles to that desired result be overcome at some cost _meta_end_dot_

 rather than military victory democrats want political victory _meta_end_dot_

 in order to achieve that they believe that they must find the lowest cost route to their desired outcome an end to the mission in iraq _meta_end_dot_

 if democrats wanted military victory which in this context includes political stability in iraq the supplemental funding for the troops would have been passed last february when it was submitted _meta_end_dot_

 instead congress has spent ten months searching for ways to undermine the very results that they are seeking now to claim as their own _meta_end_dot_

 no amount of posturing can save democrats from their pessimism cynicism and defeatism on iraq _meta_end_dot_

 the american people are far smarter than that and so are many democrats _meta_end_dot_

 the post reports that o hanlon realizes that none of the democratic presidential candidates will be willing to sign on to his strategy and with good reason _meta_end_dot_

 they know that for the democrats there are only two options sincerely admit their mistakes and apologize to the american people or continue to try and prevent the growing victory in iraq from making life any worse for the democratic party _meta_end_dot_
