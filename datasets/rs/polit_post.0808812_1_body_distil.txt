 you chose to keep your mouth shut about your pastor s message for twenty years don t go pretending otherwise to fox news now just because your poll numbers took a hit _meta_end_dot_

 and it just makes your followers look a little bit more like nitwits for buying what you re selling _meta_end_dot_

 i hardly think that this was nice of you frankly they re taking a lot of hits for their uncritical adoration of you lately and it seems rather rude of you to take advantage of said adoration so blatantly _meta_end_dot_

 take another couple days off senator _meta_end_dot_
