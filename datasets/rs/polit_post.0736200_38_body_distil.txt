  the house democratic caucus has a problem it has a number of freshmen members who got elected from conservative districts _meta_end_dot_

 said freshmen members will not long survive if they do not show some independence from the house democratic leadership _meta_end_dot_

 and _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 that s it _meta_end_dot_

 there are no major substantive differences between the freshmen and the house democratic leadership _meta_end_dot_

 there are no serious philosophical divides between the two camps _meta_end_dot_

 the house democratic leadership allows the freshmen to pose as latter day subjects of a profiles in courage piece while at the same time ensuring that when it comes to actual substantive votes the freshmen display absolute fealty to the leadership must know that most voters won t delve into the specifics of his voting record to find that in the overwhelming majority of instances in which he took a bold and brave stance against his own party leadership those bold and brave stances entailed voting against approving the journal _meta_end_dot_
