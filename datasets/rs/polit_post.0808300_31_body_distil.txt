  well there you have it _meta_end_dot_

 redstate has officially let me in _meta_end_dot_

 like me you re probably wondering how this could have happened _meta_end_dot_

 has redstate jumped the shark _meta_end_question_

 i ve been blogging for over _meta_number_ref_ years now i think it s hard to tell time online _meta_end_dot_

 before that i was a frequent message board pontificator and before that i would just harass people at parties with off the cuff essay recitations _meta_end_dot_

 you haven t lived until tried to engage someone on burke s _meta_number_ref_ address to the british colonists in north america during a drinking contest at the barracks _meta_end_dot_

 it s been a rocky road for me online _meta_end_dot_

 when i started out i was a wanna be writer opining in juvenile discussion forums about the senselessness of human existence and exchanging amateur poetry experiencing and sharing paeans to artistic genius and analysis such as i like the way every other line rhymes for the most part eventually i moved away from discussion forums and entered the fray of debate forums _meta_end_dot_

 i fit in well _meta_end_dot_

 i don t mind saying i was a master of the art of the flame _meta_end_dot_

 for the uninitiated among us a flame is a type of insult peculiar to the internet _meta_end_dot_

 click here for one of the nastiest flame threads in existence language and sanity warning of course the masters of the flame will make you laugh at your own permanent humiliation _meta_end_dot_

 i lived in this space for years _meta_end_dot_

 when the age of blogs dawned i was a natural early adopter _meta_end_dot_

 my combative record online led me first to become a commenter on other blogs _meta_end_dot_

 i have a confession i ve sat on for years i was a reverse moby _meta_end_dot_

 that s right i originally tried the ultra lame practice of adopting the pretense of comity on liberal leaning blogs in order to try and make right arguments from the left _meta_end_dot_

 this was a spectacular failure and was the story of my first day on blogs _meta_end_dot_

 humbled i moved back into my genetically pre determined role of provocateur and carried on _meta_end_dot_

 eventually though i felt i needed my own homestead _meta_end_dot_

 i needed my own blog _meta_end_dot_

 i believed that blogging was the future of writing _meta_end_dot_

 those tiresome columnists and book writers were blind luddites hacking away at their _meta_number_ref_th century typewriters _meta_end_dot_

 i was an espresso drinker not a cup of joe reporter _meta_end_dot_

 so i set up at blogspot and chose to use a new name _meta_end_dot_

 it was time to break with my message board past and enter the new age message boards were so _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 i travel a lot for work and of course i traveled quite a lot while i was in the marine corps _meta_end_dot_

 i also have a procrastination disease when things are expected of me _meta_end_dot_

 i knew there would be large blocks of blank dates on my blog _meta_end_dot_

 what better name i thought than absentee _meta_end_question_

 actually i seriously considered neologist but i ve used it too many other places as blogs went in those days mine was a smashing success _meta_end_dot_

 this is to say someone visited there once and felt compelled to comment _meta_end_dot_

 i knew this meant i was destined to be a blogger for all time _meta_end_dot_

 this was the future i could feel it and as we know feelings are futuristic by nature _meta_end_dot_

 i bought hewitt s book blog and read it at starbucks and caribou coffee _meta_end_dot_

 i m so twenty first century i thought over my double cappuccino _meta_end_dot_

 the blog did ok _meta_end_dot_

 i got some nice link ins once in a while especially on non political entries _meta_end_dot_

 when eason jordan was forced to retire i got a trackback and plug from lashawn barber _meta_end_dot_

 this was it _meta_end_exclamation_

 i had arrived _meta_end_exclamation_

 with all the perspicacious wisdom of howard hughes building the spruce goose i designed to capitalize on my moment by disappearing for several months _meta_end_dot_

 through some kind of cosmic injustice this failed to inflate my hit count _meta_end_dot_

 eventually i went hybrid spending part of my time blogging and part of my time assaulting the comments sections of liberal blogs _meta_end_dot_

 i spent more and more time at americablog and sadly no a destructive interloper at the former and a mostly silent observer at the latter _meta_end_dot_

 and hey if you are looking for a liberal blog to cut your teeth on or just observe skip kos and go for sadly no _meta_end_exclamation_

 especially note retardo montalban html mencken they ve got offensive snark down to an art form over there so don t say i didn t warn you i would fight with kossaks and get banned or get bloody at eschaton or steve gilliards travesty of a blog _meta_end_dot_

 as i engaged time and again i once more sank almost completely into my opposition role _meta_end_dot_

 however trying to persuade people in the comments sections of left blogs is very napoleon in russia it seems heroic but you end up leaving frozen corpses everywhere and have neither vodka nor tolstoy to show for it _meta_end_dot_

 when i found redstate i was still combative by nature _meta_end_dot_

 my first few blogs met with limited success too heavy on the snark too light on the smart _meta_end_dot_

 i stuck around though for the same reasons all of you have _meta_end_dot_

 redstate is a haven online _meta_end_dot_

 it s unique among the blogs _meta_end_dot_

 the comments areas are not snoopy vs _meta_end_dot_

 the red baron they are lincoln vs _meta_end_dot_

 douglas _meta_end_dot_

 eventually i adjusted _meta_end_dot_

 i started to learn and better than that i started to contribute _meta_end_dot_

 over time either age or wisdom or perhaps necessity have mellowed my combative side _meta_end_dot_

 these days i m practically agreeable _meta_end_dot_

 blogging is an interesting hobby _meta_end_dot_

 it s not just writing _meta_end_dot_

 it s linking it s being snarky and it s being challenged _meta_end_dot_

 blogging at redstate has been one of the great enjoyments for me the last few years _meta_end_dot_

 sure sometimes i miss the more combative experiences and yes i miss lovingly crafting uber hardcore flamage but ultimately i m just glad to have an opportunity to talk about what i m thinking about _meta_end_dot_

 i m surprised to be in this position today _meta_end_dot_

 i only hope i can put up some blogs that people want to read _meta_end_dot_

 we come to redstate to read blogs essentially and i hope i bring some good ones to the table _meta_end_dot_

 i am a republican and i mean that most definitively _meta_end_dot_

 i want republicans in office i want republicans to beat democrats and i believe republicans are the force that will keep america great and strong _meta_end_dot_

 for the most part that optimism and party loyalty drive my topic selection _meta_end_dot_

 i hope it doesn t become tedious with time _meta_end_dot_

 i ve been greatly honored with this opportunity _meta_end_dot_

 i cannot express the fervency of my hope that i am up to the task _meta_end_dot_

 absentee
