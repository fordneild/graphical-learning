  so i have taken my time in deciding which candidate i will endorse for president of the united states but with the iowa caucuses coming up it is indeed time for me to put up or shut up _meta_end_dot_

 before i get to the candidate of my choice it behooves me to discuss briefly a few of the other contenders _meta_end_dot_

 there s a lot more below _meta_end_dot_

 a whole lot more _meta_end_dot_

 read on _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 first there is rudy giuliani _meta_end_dot_

 his attractions are many _meta_end_dot_

 he is very smart very serious and a significantly more disciplined as a candidate for president than he was as mayor when many a time his actions seemed frivolous in the extreme _meta_end_dot_

 i am impressed with his energy and with the fact that he has worked to master a lot of policy detail in making his run _meta_end_dot_

 i am certainly impressed with giuliani s justice advisory committee and i believe that the people he selected for the committee speak well of giuliani s legal philosophy _meta_end_dot_

 and of course giuliani acquitted himself brilliantly in responding to the devastating _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ attacks _meta_end_dot_

 for his courage for his calm leadership and for his heroism he has and deserves the nation s thanks and praise _meta_end_dot_

 the downsides however are that giuliani for all of his heroism concerning the response to _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ has less foreign policy and national security experience than many other candidates _meta_end_dot_

 his second amendment stance as the mayor of new york left a lot to be desired for supporters of second amendment rights and while his pro choice sentiments are apparently unshakable he could at least have appreciated and bowed to the surprisingly robust consensus that as a decision roe v _meta_end_dot_

 wade was bad law _meta_end_dot_

 some people are hung up with stylistic differences that they have with rudy giuliani _meta_end_dot_

 i have serious policy differences and while those policy differences may be subsumed in a general election contest they are not subsumed in the primary campaign _meta_end_dot_

 mitt romney is a bright and attractive candidate who has performed turnaround miracles in business _meta_end_dot_

 unfortunately he chose to turn off a lot of republicans by pushing for mandatory health insurance in massachusetts when he served as governor a program that has failed at controlling costs a program that only serves to give democrats a template with which to implement a disastrous universal health care plan and a program whose very mandatory nature is fundamentally antithetical to even the most minimal conceptions of liberty _meta_end_dot_

 the policy flip flops are also disconcerting _meta_end_dot_

 while romney claims that they were not made in preparation for this election and while his record as governor of massachusetts shows a distinctly conservative bent one cannot help but wonder whether or not romney changed his policies anticipating that soon after his service as governor of massachusetts he would enter the race for the presidency _meta_end_dot_

 in any event it is hard to take seriously the supposed conversion to philosophical conservatism made by a candidate who in his _meta_number_ref_ race against ted kennedy sought to distance himself from the legacy of reaganism _meta_end_dot_

 i realize that one has to make allowances for republicans who run in massachusetts but at that point in time being associated with reaganism should have been a no brainer for a republican _meta_end_dot_

 in addition while romney is a very bright businessman and while he is certainly conversant on policy matters his intellectual curiosity regarding political issues is significantly less pronounced than it is on business issues _meta_end_dot_

 romney is the person who as a young boy when he saw the rambler s his father s car company was producing and heard tales singing their praises asked his father if these cars are so good why aren t they selling more a precocious and good question _meta_end_dot_

 romney is also the same businessman who discovered the market potential of staples by examining in minute detail receipts of other businesses and seeing just how much those businesses invested in office supplies _meta_end_dot_

 his intellectual engagement and attention to detail on that issues should be commended and turned out to be a very lucrative exercise for him and for his business partners _meta_end_dot_

 and yet when romney was asked for his position on the mccain kennedy immigration bill and about what he would do in the event that military action against iran had to be contemplated he begged off of discussing any details saying instead that he would consult with lawyers _meta_end_dot_

 a former governor of massachusetts and a potential president of the united states should evince greater intellectual curiosity about legislation like the mccain kennedy immigration bill legislation which may cross romney s desk should he become president _meta_end_dot_

 romney certainly had a fair amount of legislation cross his desk as governor _meta_end_dot_

 was he as uninterested in the details of those bills as well _meta_end_question_

 additionally a potential president of the united states should have a national security strategy clearly in mind and should know enough to know that decisions on national security matters can t be outsourced to lawyers with the intention of allowing presidential candidates to avoid talking about those decisions and issues in depth _meta_end_dot_

 as for john mccain he has excellent foreign policy and national security credentials and his support for the surge in iraq is as praiseworthy as it is well founded _meta_end_dot_

 mccain is deeply honorable and a credit to the country _meta_end_dot_

 unfortunately he maintains big government attitudes on a number of issues including and most notably his continued support for campaign finance reform which constitutes nothing more and nothing less than an assault on free speech and extends the misguided and unfortunate legacy of the supreme court s _meta_number_ref_ ruling in buckley v _meta_end_dot_

 valeo _meta_end_dot_

 free speech is a big deal and mccain is on the wrong side in a significant way _meta_end_dot_

 i can nevertheless appreciate certain significant aspects of the giuliani romney and mccain records _meta_end_dot_

 mike huckabee however has no redeeming virtues save a charming personality and a way with quips _meta_end_dot_

 his lack of substantive knowledge especially when it comes to the issue of foreign policy is stark and deeply distressing _meta_end_dot_

 he would need more on the job training than any of the other republican candidates for president and a number of the democrats would bring more experience to the table as well _meta_end_dot_

 in addition huckabee invites the republican party to go back to a protectionist mercantilist platform when it comes to trade and his brand of populism only serves to do what democrats have been accused of doing for years promote and intensify class warfare _meta_end_dot_

 it is shocking and astonishing that huckabee is actually a serious contender for the republican presidential nomination _meta_end_dot_

 one hopes that his appeal will soon peter out _meta_end_dot_

 it couldn t happen to a more deserving candidate on the gop side _meta_end_dot_

 duncan hunter and tom tancredo _meta_end_question_

 not serious nativists protectionists and just warmed over huckabees without the winsome smile _meta_end_dot_

 ron paul _meta_end_question_

 an utterly impracticable choice in a world demanding serious people to deal with serious issues _meta_end_dot_

 alan keyes _meta_end_question_

 give me a break _meta_end_dot_

 my emphasis in this and other writings when it comes to political discussions has been on policy _meta_end_dot_

 i want a candidate who espouses small government federalism free markets free trade a brave and unabashed message of capitalism and consequential weighty and creative solutions to the many foreign policy and national security dilemmas facing the united states _meta_end_dot_

 that s why i am supporting fred thompson for president _meta_end_dot_

 start with the issue of policy substance _meta_end_dot_

 thompson has loads of it as this editorial makes clear _meta_end_dot_

 thompson has made detailed and specific proposals concerning the issue of entitlement reform oftentimes in the face of overwhelming and widespread political fears that to mention the need for entitlement reforms is to kiss one s chances at electability goodbye _meta_end_dot_

 there is something refreshing about a candidate for president willing to risk his electoral chances to speak some hard policy choices and thompson is to be commended for his bravery _meta_end_dot_

 as the editorial makes clear thompson has also presented innovative and intellectually rigorous ideas concerning immigration and the size of the nation s military _meta_end_dot_

 the adam smith institute comes out with justified praise for thompson s tax plan and notes that thompson has a very interesting and original idea on how the united states could be transitioned to a flat tax system _meta_end_dot_

 anything would be better than the current progressive scheme and thompson is one of the few republican candidates who has come out with a workable alternative tax system for the united states to adopt _meta_end_dot_

 indeed as a general matter it should be noted as many have said that when it comes to policy discussions thompson is clearly intellectually and substantively prepared to wade into the deep end of the pool _meta_end_dot_

 moreover thompson clearly enjoys serious and intense policy discussions and is a genuine wonk _meta_end_dot_

 thompson intellectual approach to policy issues will lead to a more refined and successful decision making process if he should be elected president _meta_end_dot_

 contrast this most especially with huckabee who resembles for all of his silver tongued eloquence a drowning man when conversations get excessively substantive _meta_end_dot_

 the choice between these two candidates should be and is no choice at all _meta_end_dot_

 thompson is simply one of the most intellectually impressive candidates on either side _meta_end_dot_

 policy wonks like me appreciate and respect his serious attitude to substance and the issues and such seriousness is in great demand given the policy challenges we face _meta_end_dot_

 not only is thompson s command something to admire his stances are ones that republican voters can get enthusiastic about and get behind as quin hillyer writes piles on the supreme court s manifest lead on the issue of campaign finance reform and lead an effort to scrap mccain feingold once and for all _meta_end_dot_

 when it comes to the issue of federalism thompson has received well earned kudos on the issue of national security thompson fits the bill _meta_end_dot_

 his bio points out that thompson served as special counsel senate committee on foreign relations _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ and special counsel senate intelligence committee _meta_number_ref_ all of which entails significant amounts of exposure to foreign policy issues _meta_end_dot_

 in addition wikipedia informs us that thompson is a member of the council on foreign relations and a visiting fellow with the american enterprise institute specializing in national security and intelligence thompson s interest in foreign policy and national security affairs is readily apparent in discussions with him _meta_end_dot_

 back to hillyer boils things down doing something than he is in being somebody _meta_end_dot_

 this is true _meta_end_dot_

 ambition is a good thing to have but far too many politicians make ambition an end in and of itself _meta_end_dot_

 for thompson ambition is a means to an end a means to implementing the policy positions he and other reagan republicans care about so deeply _meta_end_dot_

 that having been written thompson owes it to his supporters to vigorously campaign for the presidency of the united states _meta_end_dot_

 people like me have invested a lot of hope in thompson s candidacy as being the truest campaign there is to the principles of reaganism _meta_end_dot_

 reaganism deserves a forceful articulate tireless and compelling champion for its philosophy _meta_end_dot_

 if thompson is willing to be that candidate if he is ambitious not for himself but for the beliefs he holds and for the country which can benefit mightily from the application of those beliefs his candidacy can serve as a powerful standard to which republicans can rally _meta_end_dot_

 and more importantly it can lead to a presidency of success and promise _meta_end_dot_

 we have waited a long time for a candidate who puts substance over style _meta_end_dot_

 now is the time for him and for his supporters to put their noses to the grindstone and realize his vision _meta_end_dot_

 fred thompson for president _meta_end_dot_
