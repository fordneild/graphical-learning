  last night s democrat debate might as well have been tea for two on a monday afternoon _meta_end_dot_

 obama and clinton went out of their way to be nice to one another expressing friendship similar policies on healthcare immigration and the war and of course bashing the bush white house and republicans _meta_end_dot_

 the only minor tiffs were regarding hillary s flip flopped non support for allowing illegal immigrants driver s licenses and voting for the war in iraq in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 read on _meta_end_dot_

 but you ll have that _meta_end_dot_

 clinton usually jumps so far past the actual question she forgets what she was asked in the first place _meta_end_dot_

 but i like how gerard baker of the times online put it clinton s thoughts on ending the war sounded almost impressive next to obama s who can say nothing more than troops out now as i wrote today in human events liberal love last night didn t permit the mean spirited politics obama and hillary have engaged in so recently _meta_end_dot_

 we ll see how long this camaraderie lasts come tuesday morning when the going really gets going _meta_end_dot_
