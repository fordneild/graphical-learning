  much has been made of the adherence maintained by a number of higher education institutions towards the policy of affirmative action _meta_end_dot_

 what hasn t been discussed at length is the fact that this adherence comes largely from the need of higher education institutions to bow and scrape before agencies that have the power to deny accreditation to institutions that do not toe the line regarding affirmative action _meta_end_dot_

 via southern appeal comes this editorial by professor gail heriot who is well known to people who read the right coast which outlines the degree to which higher education institutions must bow and scrape when it comes to the issue of affirmative action _meta_end_dot_

 the need to bow and scrape very nearly got george mason university school of law in trouble with the american bar association _meta_end_dot_

 this should of course frighten educators _meta_end_dot_

 gmu s law school is genuinely excellent of course blog readers know that a whole host of lawbloggers and econobloggers are from gmu and the fact that it has to continually adjust and lower its admissions standards just to curry favor with the aba should outrage people _meta_end_dot_

 diversity is a wonderful thing but whence comes the authority of the aba to determine whether diversity standards have been met and whether students at a particular school will be able to get access to student loans _meta_end_question_

 the good news as professor heriot points out is that the department of education is closely examining this issue and the aba s own accreditation _meta_end_dot_

 here s hoping that the department either forces the aba to get off the backs of law schools or that it pushes the aba out of the accreditation process altogether _meta_end_dot_
