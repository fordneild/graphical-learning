  on june _meta_number_ref_ redstate s soren dayton introduced us to eric holder a member formerly along with not the jim johnson barack obama used to know of the obama vice presidential search team _meta_end_dot_

 at the time dayton wrote the following pittsburgh post gazette has caught on as well running an op ed from jack kelly titled there goes another one obama seems blind to the ethical problems of his associates which says the obama new politics express appears to be running a bit behind schedule mowing down friends advisors and confidantes after rather than before they embarrass the candidate in a very public way _meta_end_dot_

 in fairness to barack obama though it s got to be tough to be a quick learner when you grew up steeped in and continue to represent the oldest brand of politics america s second city has to offer _meta_end_dot_

 changing the wrapper is easy as obama has shown with his potemkin hopechangehopechange campaign _meta_end_dot_

 actually changing yourself though to represent and embody something different than the identity politicking underhanded cronyist world you come from and have always worked in _meta_end_question_

 that would appear to be a far more difficult feat and it is one that obama if trying at all is failing at miserably _meta_end_dot_
