  when you re barack obama you can pursue an orwellian rhetorical style because you have several crucial factors in your favor you re young _meta_end_dot_

 you re good looking _meta_end_dot_

 you have a pleasant deep voice _meta_end_dot_

 and you can blunt any criticism no matter how cogent just by saying you re only beating up on me because i m black now that obama has thrown campaign finance reform under the bus it doesn t suit his newly affluent circumstances he has to deal with the price of gasoline _meta_end_dot_

 he s come out with a rather esoteric set of regulatory proposals to deal with the issue which has remarkably become perhaps the most important one of the summer _meta_end_dot_

 i ll take you through a short explanation of what our hero thinks he wants to do but as you ll see his bottom line is rather different from what you might think it is _meta_end_dot_

 keep reading i m one of a handful of people who have been telling you all along that a significant amount of the price of oil comes from financial rather than fundamental activity _meta_end_dot_

 there are people who pump oil out of the ground and they naturally want to sell it _meta_end_dot_

 there are other people who turn crude oil into industrial products like gasoline and they naturally want to buy it _meta_end_dot_

 this is fundamental supply and demand _meta_end_dot_

 but there are a lot of people who buy and sell crude oil in the form of futures contracts options on futures in the stock market and via swaps only because they think the price will rise or fall in a particular stretch of time _meta_end_dot_

 these people are called speculators _meta_end_dot_

 specs have come in for a lot of angry fingerpointing as the price of crude oil has risen but they re an essential part of the structure of commodities markets and always have been _meta_end_dot_

 they supply the liquidity that makes it possible for the hedgers to manage their risk _meta_end_dot_

 now it turns out that speculative activity tends to exaggerate price movements when everyone thinks the market is headed one way or the other _meta_end_dot_

 and these days everyone thinks oil is rising in price for a lot of reasons including the global demand picture and the weak dollar so a significant amount of paper oil has been forward purchased by people who have no intention of actually taking delivery of the stuff _meta_end_dot_

 this accounts for a quite significant amount of the price of oil _meta_end_dot_

 how much _meta_end_question_

 my guess is that financial buying accounts for about a third of the barrel price a solid _meta_dollor_ref_ or even more _meta_end_dot_

 but the real answer is that no one knows _meta_end_dot_

 and this is where barack obama comes in _meta_end_dot_

 you see superman has understood that we the people that would be schlubs like you and me don t think we should be paying _meta_dollor_ref_ gallon for gasoline _meta_end_dot_

 there s enough agita in this both to require a response and to constitute an opportunity _meta_end_dot_

 while john mccain has come out in favor of increasing supplies of domestically produced energy as a way of lowering its price obama has come out against speculation instead _meta_end_dot_

 hang with me here because this gets a little hairy _meta_end_dot_

 everyone who buys and sells commodities on an exchange like the new york mercantile exchange where crude oil trades is required to meet some strict requirements _meta_end_dot_

 they have to put up a minimum amount of capital which acts to limit how much they can trade for nymex members it s about _meta_percent_ref_ of the value of the oil they buy or sell their positions are marked to market every night and the exchange reports all trading to the commodities and futures trading commission cftc _meta_end_dot_

 but it turns out that for a handful of reasons an unknown but certainly very large amount of crude oil trading manages to escape these regulations _meta_end_dot_

 a lot of trading goes through the london intercontinental exchange ice where it doesn t get reported to the cftc _meta_end_dot_

 and a lot of it isn t in the form of futures contracts at all but rather in over the counter swaps contracts that are essentially legal agreements made between hedge funds and large banks or wall street firms and that effectively circumvent the position limits on normal trading _meta_end_dot_

 now barack obama in full orwellian mode wants to blame this non transparent trading activity on some rule changes that were made during the clinton administration _meta_end_dot_

 since they benefited the enron corporation in its pas de deux with the devil these rule changes are called the enron loophole and of course wendy gramm wife of senator phil was a director of enron and later commissioner of the cftc _meta_end_dot_

 and you know that senator gramm is advising the mccain campaign _meta_end_dot_

 so now barry orwell obama is saying that john mccain is to blame for this set of rule changes that bill clinton signed into law _meta_end_dot_

 anyway superman says that the key to reducing the price of oil is to fully eliminate the enron loophole _meta_end_dot_

 the reason he has to say it like that is because the loophole has already been closed and not by him _meta_end_dot_

 several days ago the current cftc commissioner announced stricter position limits and reporting requirements for us accounts trading crude oil to take effect in _meta_number_ref_ days even for accounts trading in london _meta_end_dot_

 and in any case the basic transparency problem has been known to the us senate since _meta_number_ref_ when a finance subcommittee published a widely ignored report on the problem _meta_end_dot_

 so superman thinks he can wave his long graceful arms grin his broad grin and get you to think he will bring transparency to the crude oil markets _meta_end_dot_

 he had the good sense to also recommend that global coordination among regulatory authorities will be required to make this happen because obviously london ice answers not to the cftc but rather to britain s financial services authority fsa _meta_end_dot_

 that sounds like a good idea except that it s not barry s either _meta_end_dot_

 authorities like new york fed president geithner treasury secretary paulson and fed chairman bernanke have been saying it for months now along with eminent private citizens like alan greenspan and a host of wall street bigshots _meta_end_dot_

 so full transparency in futures trading is many years away if it s even possible at all _meta_end_dot_

 and at any rate it solves a data problem not the underlying issue which is that crude oil is in demand and not just by people who want to turn it into fuel _meta_end_dot_

 what obama hasn t said yet is whether he actually believes that crude oil speculation should be curtailed rather than simply better reported _meta_end_dot_

 there is very definitely a role for sensible regulation of futures markets and there is a role for better regulation than we have today _meta_end_dot_

 i m entirely open to having this conversation _meta_end_dot_

 but i d really like to see superman lay his cards on the table first since he s running for president and i m not _meta_end_dot_

 then we can talk _meta_end_dot_

 there is a final bit of irony from barack obama when he talks about the price of crude oil which is important to most people not in itself but because it affects the price of gasoline _meta_end_dot_

 barry is completely convinced as he has let slip on occasion when he thought we weren t listening that the price of gasoline is now too low _meta_end_dot_

 that s because he wants to force the usage of less oil in the united states of america _meta_end_dot_

 that s why in dealing with a proximate political problem he chose to completely ignore the supply side of the oil price equation _meta_end_dot_

 let s be honest about this _meta_end_dot_

 you might be able to make crude oil less expensive by curtailing speculation if you can find a way to do it without completely destabilizing this crucial global market _meta_end_dot_

 but you won t ultimately make more energy available to american consumers that way _meta_end_dot_

 and that suits barack obama just fine _meta_end_dot_
