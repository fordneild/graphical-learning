  on the way out of church today three different men in the church cornered me to ask me if i liked huckabee _meta_end_dot_

 i told them i was afraid of his economic policies but very much personally liked the guy _meta_end_dot_

 that was good enough for them _meta_end_dot_

 they d heard dobson was coming out for him _meta_end_dot_

 these guys have been sitting on the fence not writing checks _meta_end_dot_

 that sound you hear this week is the sound of evangelical christians getting their checkbooks out _meta_end_dot_

 of course once you mention that huck is on about global warming and the imbalance in executive pay you may just hear these same check writers put the checkbook back in the drawer _meta_end_dot_
