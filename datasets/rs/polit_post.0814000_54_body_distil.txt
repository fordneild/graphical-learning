 if this is just a big giant publicity stunt by the obama campaign to get attention then i suppose that the campaign is to be applauded for the effort to ensure that their candidate gets as much publicity as possible _meta_end_dot_

 but there is no reason whatsoever for the press to fall for it _meta_end_dot_
