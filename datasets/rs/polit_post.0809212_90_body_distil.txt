 this is the sort of move that makes those naturally inclined to distrust the government even more convinced they ve got something to hide _meta_end_dot_

 while the elected acting and sitting mayor of the city of detroit prepares to go to trial facing twelve counts including eight felony indictments that could land him in the clink for fifteen years charges directly related to a cover up by his administration the good folks at city hall took cover ups one step further this past weekend _meta_end_dot_

 the family of dancer tamara greene one norman yatooma has retained council and is investigating her still unsolved murder _meta_end_dot_

 there are a lot of unsolved murders in detroit but this one is unique for one particular reason _meta_end_dot_

 greene was rumored to have been involved in a little scuffle with the mayor s wife at a wild party at the manoogian mansion _meta_end_dot_

 rumors _meta_end_dot_

 i don t know if they re true _meta_end_dot_

 frankly i d always assumed they weren t _meta_end_dot_

 attorney general mike cox investigated the supposed party and concluded himself that it never happened _meta_end_dot_

 it s a big stretch for me to think that it not only did happen but there was a dancer she did fight with the mayor s wife and that that may have some connection as to why she wound up dead _meta_end_dot_

 it s suddenly less of a stretch though the way the city of detroit is playing games with her family s council and against court orders refusing to turn over evidence _meta_end_dot_

 the detroit news reports and in a dizzying bit of irony the lawyer working for the city on this case obfuscating justice and potentially protecting murderers is none other than mayer morganroth seen here with another famous client of his convicted serial killer and _meta_number_ref_th district lefty congressional candidate jack kevorkian _meta_end_dot_

 i guess if you re going to try to get someone off the hook for murder you might as well hire a guy who s spent his career defending mass murderers asked by the news about the contempt motion morganroth that ladies and gentlemen is ironic _meta_end_dot_

 this is a lawyer who made his career defending a man who claims to have killed well over one hundred people in clear violation of the law by arguing the merits of the law in you guessed it the news media _meta_end_dot_

 nice try mayer _meta_end_dot_

 and mr _meta_end_dot_

 mayor _meta_end_dot_

 if you d rather have the greene case litigated in the court of law then novel idea comply with court orders turn over documents and let in a little bit of sunshine _meta_end_dot_

 what have you got to hide besides the truth_meta_beep_ref_br
