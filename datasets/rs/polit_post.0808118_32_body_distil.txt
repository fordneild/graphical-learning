  our opposite numbers are starting to contemplate the possibility the faint quiet nigh minuscule possibility that events will not spontaneously array themselves in perfect harmony with the smallest whim of the antiwar movement as opposed to the last seven years which of course have been nothing but progressive triumph after triumph _meta_end_dot_

 how are they reacting to this _meta_end_question_

 about as you d expect h t the campaign spot read on _meta_end_dot_

 a cruel man would be posting travel information for denver right now much as it s a temptation this other campaign spot post suggests that the city really isn t what you d call ready for the storm that s looming on the horizon _meta_end_dot_

 and while i may weep no tears for the denver city government i do feel sorry for any shop owner within half a mile of the convention center _meta_end_dot_

 it s not their fault that the dnc couldn t organize an orgy in a brothel it s certainly not their fault that the democratic party is on the teasing verge of discovering once and for all why you shouldn t use mutual appreciation of each other s victimhood as a binding agent _meta_end_dot_

 but neither am i inclined to actually stand in their way to self immolation either _meta_end_dot_

 still early days yet although not as early as they were this time last month when we were being assured that the primaries would be over _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_question_

 and perhaps the bleeding will stop for the obama campaign _meta_end_dot_

 perhaps the super delegates will end the issue once and for all _meta_end_dot_

 and perhaps i ll even get a pony _meta_end_dot_

 but if i don t get my pony thus forcing al giordano and twenty thousand of his colleagues to _meta_end_dot_

 direct action all over denver s pepsi center i just want to make this clear to the democrats you earned this _meta_end_dot_
