  well the caucusers have been counted in iowa and wyoming and the votes are in in new hampshire and the candidate i have endorsed rudy giuliani has yet to get off the mat while one guy we all buried last summer john mccain is suddenly in the thick of the race and could officially claim frontrunner status if he can win the michigan primary on tuesday january _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 as a result and i ve been building to this for the past two months so new hampshire just brings this to a head i find myself on the horns of a dilemma regarding the _meta_number_ref_ gop presidential primaries and i don t mind sharing it with you dear readers i m debating whether it s time to back another candidate besides rudy specifically mccain _meta_end_dot_

 i don t do this lightly i ve debated the merits of others in the field before but i don t shed commitments easily and my longstanding view is that having made my choice i won t switch to another candidate unless and until i m decided to walk away from the rudy camp for good _meta_end_dot_

 i m still not ready to do that but for now at least i m happy to see senator mccain s victory in new hampshire and i even sent a donation his way to help him take on romney and huckabee _meta_end_dot_

 as regular readers will recall while i supported mccain in _meta_number_ref_ i have been a long time supporter of rudy having followed his career since the mid _meta_number_ref_s lived in new york city through his second term as mayor and been through september _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 i laid out in the summer of _meta_number_ref_ my roadmap for how i thought he could pursue the gop presidential nomination in spite of his pro choice socially liberal record and i came out publicly for giuliani for president in february _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 today i ll explain why mccain may end up being my guy after all and why the collective impulse of a lot of us to settle on mccain is tantamount to taking the known divisions within the party and kicking them down the road for the sake of this election even if possibly at the cost of aggravating them further in the interim _meta_end_dot_

 read on _meta_end_dot_

 you can t make me vote for the amateurs or the sunday pitcher while i would vote for any of the big five in a general election i won t repeat here my reasons for considering mitt romney an unacceptable choice for the nomination which i chronicled exhaustively in my the trouble with mitt romney series parts _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ and _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 and i will touch only very briefly why i can t support mike huckabee _meta_end_dot_

 back when he was a minor candidate i wrote off huckabee due to the domestic policy concerns laid out here including not just his record but his priorities _meta_end_dot_

 just as i was starting to reconcile myself to the idea that we could win a general election with huck and live with his harebrained economic populism and nanny statism however we got increasing evidence see e g his foreign affairs piece chock full of every discredited democratic foreign policy cliche in the book of his unreadiness to be the commander in chief _meta_end_dot_

 on this i even agree with this guy _meta_end_dot_

 suffice to say that my presidential choice at this stage as is true of many conservatives who regard national security as issue _meta_number_ref_ during wartime is thus limited to the three candidates in the gop field i regard as serious grownups rudy mccain and fred thompson _meta_end_dot_

 and i explained recently why i m not backing fred much as i like him _meta_end_dot_

 which leaves me two choices rudy and mccain _meta_end_dot_

 schism today or schism tomorrow _meta_end_question_

 let s go back to my test for candidates as set out in the opener to the romney series on _meta_number_ref_ while there are differences between rudy and mccain i regard both of them as fundamentally trustworthy on the war ready to step in as commander in chief as ready as anyone can be coming from congress or state local government at any rate and head and shoulders above the field in both parties in terms of their credibility on this issue to the point where mccain even won among anti iraq war voters in nh _meta_end_dot_

 because i trust both men to protect the nation when the chips are down that leaves the first three questions _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 chasing the electability chimera here s the irony one of the reasons i had initially for supporting rudy was that he s such a great campaigner and debater and would be a formidable opponent for hillary or now possibly obama in the general election _meta_end_dot_

 but right now there s growing reason to believe that mccain would be the gop s strongest general election candidate which i ll get to in a second _meta_end_dot_

 yet as discussed below i still think rudy would be the better president of the two and that rudy would advance more of the conservative agenda while mccain seems more likely to unify the gop coalition during the campaign and fracture it in office _meta_end_dot_

 the decision between the two therefore comes down to how we weigh electability against governability as well as its wages in subsequent elections _meta_end_dot_

 i view electability mainly as a floor if we have multiple candidates who can win you pick the one you would most like to win _meta_end_dot_

 but electability is itself a moving and elusive target _meta_end_dot_

 the problem in this election is that the gop starts in such a bad place against such well known and well funded democratic opponents and the stakes in this race are so high at least in terms of the war the courts and taxes i m far less optimistic than in _meta_number_ref_ or _meta_number_ref_ that we can move the ball on any other domestic legislative priorities of consequence in the next four years that electability looms larger than it has in years past _meta_end_dot_

 mccain consistently polls better than any other republican in projected head to head matchups especially in the key swing state of ohio without which no republican has ever won the white house adam c has covered this extensively _meta_end_dot_

 i personally don t take polls _meta_number_ref_ months before an election as terribly strong evidence given the things that can change in the course of a contested campaign but it is one piece of data to consider _meta_end_dot_

 there are two considerations that carry more weight than polls at least at this stage in determining electability _meta_end_dot_

 one is gained from watching the candidate and his campaign in action _meta_end_dot_

 on that score neither mccain nor giuliani has run the best of campaigns given their strong positions this time a year ago neither is in the position they should be in but both remain excellent candidates eloquent funny quick on their feet thoroughly at home with their reputations as rough edged tough guys and long experienced in taking shots from both sides of the aisle _meta_end_dot_

 both men should fare well in providing either the charisma and humor that s lacking in hillary or the spine and gravitas that s lacking in obama _meta_end_dot_

 neither should be taken lightly in a debate _meta_end_dot_

 since it takes two to get votes the candidate and the voter however the other part of the electability equation is what voters they will appeal to _meta_end_dot_

 and here is where rudy s flaws as a candidate require serious thought _meta_end_dot_

 two stand out _meta_end_dot_

 i ve spent a lot of time arguing with people about these issues but i hope nobody came away with the impression that i don t take them seriously _meta_end_dot_

 they are in fact the main reasons to worry about rudy in november _meta_end_dot_

 the first is his liberal record and positions on social issues mainly abortion _meta_end_dot_

 there are some conservative voters who simply will refuse to pull the lever for rudy even knowing that the result could be handing the control of the courts and the rest of the social issue agenda to hillary clinton _meta_end_dot_

 i ve argued repeatedly that this is daft but that s beside the point the point is that it s a feature of the map as real as any other _meta_end_dot_

 nobody really knows how many such voters there are and certainly a lot of them are likely to reside in solid red states in the deep south _meta_end_dot_

 but at least some will likely be in states we need to win _meta_end_dot_

 there are also the what s the matter with kansas voters for whom the pro life social conservative banner is the main or only reason they vote gop _meta_end_dot_

 again it can be hard to put a number on these voters but in past years they have been crucial to gop candidates winning la ar ky wv in some cases oh and ia and staying competitive in pa mi although pa also has a lot of socially liberal rs so the tradeoffs there are debatable _meta_end_dot_

 if you go back to my _meta_number_ref_ roadmap rudy has actually done most of the things i suggested to try to build bridges to these voters _meta_end_dot_

 he s appeared at the right events he s met with the right leaders and even won a few endorsements he s treated socons with respectful and solicitous language he s made the necessary do no harm promises on a host of issues and changed his positions around the margins e g partial birth abortion he s surrounded himself with a great group of advisers on judicial conservatism and he s beaten the drum for judges judges judges _meta_end_dot_

 i never thought rudy could credibly come out to call for banning abortion but he could have run as a clearer pro choice anti roe candidate and laid out a fuller more compelling story of why social issue federalism should appeal to culture warriors on both the right and the left _meta_end_dot_

 he hasn t _meta_end_dot_

 he blew an early debate answer by waffling on whether a strict constructionist judge would need to vote to overturn ro e a guy with a pro life record could afford ambiguity on that question but rudy couldn t _meta_end_dot_

 i may post at some point the precise framing of the issue that i think he needed to pursue but i no longer expect anything new on this front from him he s stuck with the residual mistrust that his abortion position created and we go to war with that in our nominee or we don t _meta_end_dot_

 social conservatives are the only faction of the party rudy has a real problem with he s run as far or further to the right of everyone in the field on national security and economic issues he s fairly successfully used his law enforcement creds to wend his way to the middle of the field on immigration and he s benefitted from the complete demise of any national impetus for gun control the silence that followed the virgina tech shootings was tellingly deafening _meta_end_dot_

 ironically given the importance of supreme court nominations rudy could actually end up mending fences in office with good judicial nominations and fidelity to the do no harm agenda _meta_end_dot_

 but he has to get there first so the schism comes to the fore now during the election season _meta_end_dot_

 the second electability issue rudy brings is his personal life and it becomes a more significant issue if running against obama than if the opponent is the clinton traveling soap opera _meta_end_dot_

 i will admit that i probably underestimated quite how badly this could hurt rudy since it was already a very well known aspect of his life and one that most people could balance against his extensive public record _meta_end_dot_

 but what happened to rudy is very easy to explain a spate of stories in early december _meta_number_ref_ about police details for judith nathan during the secret portion of their affair and the collapse of rudy s second marriage did what no story had done before and tied the issue to rudy s capacity as mayor _meta_end_dot_

 and the result more than anything else was devastating to rudy s standing in the polls the state by state results were worse essentially driving rudy out of races that had once looked competitive for him in new hampshire and michigan _meta_end_dot_

 it hardly mattered that most of the stories had little substance to them and fell apart on closer examination _meta_end_dot_

 what mattered was that it moved a lot of voters from thinking of this as old news to worrying that there were other shoes to drop _meta_end_dot_

 combined with the ugly overhang from the decline and fall of bernard kerik that issue as well is likely to dog rudy going forward _meta_end_dot_

 now there remains a good possibility that once we get down to a two person general election race rudy can offset a lot of these problems by reaching into areas where the gop has done poorly in recent years _meta_end_dot_

 he ll undoubtedly be competitive in states like pa nj that the democrats absolutely must win _meta_end_dot_

 but competitive doesn t win elections and so the rudy strategy of widening the number of states in play could still turn out to be a case of just stretching resources too thin especially in northeastern states where urban democratic machines have ground games that always win the close ones _meta_end_dot_

 rudy thus faces a two pronged electability problem mccain doesn t _meta_end_dot_

 the only gop faction that really regards mccain as anathema is the immigration hawks but i continue to doubt how large that group really is especially the segment that voted for bush _meta_end_dot_

 mccain may thus be able to cobble together a lot of different factions of the party that consider him better than the worst option in the field _meta_end_dot_

 his wry personality long tenure in office national visibility war hero status and genuine credibility on national security all add up to the makings of a consensus candidate that may be nobody s first choice but could keep the party from fracturing along its various fault lines long enough to hold the white house _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 so we won _meta_end_dot_

 what do we do now _meta_end_question_

 so yes i think mccain is electable at least as electable as anybody in the gop field _meta_end_dot_

 and i m no longer sure whether or not rudy is _meta_end_dot_

 and i can live with mccain as the nominee _meta_end_dot_

 but that doesn t mean i m leaping to his banner either _meta_end_dot_

 first i think rudy would be a better and in practice more functionally conservative president _meta_end_dot_

 i explained this in my original rudy endorsement mccain has no executive experience rudy is the most gifted and accomplished public executive of the past two decades _meta_end_dot_

 rudy is a prioritizer who wants to cut taxes and spending across the board and has a record of doing so mccain has tended to pick even his spending battles on small dollar pork projects although he did oppose bush s prescription drug boondoggle and stood vocally against bush s tax cuts _meta_end_dot_

 while i think all five major gop candidates would be good on judges but i trust none of them except fred _meta_percent_ref_ on the issue i think it more likely that rudy will listen to his advisers on this issue and try to establish a good process whereas i still worry that mccain might prioritize his campaign finance crusade which will never be blessed by judges who take the constitution seriously _meta_end_dot_

 mccain is more likely to pursue death to conservative priorities by a thousand cuts in the regulatory agencies environmental policy etc _meta_end_dot_

 more to the point not only is rudy more conservative on the issues that are the bread and butter of the president s daily business and traditional article ii powers but it s mccain s style that worries me _meta_end_dot_

 we all know too well see here and here for good analyses how mccain has over and over and over sought to triangulate putting himself in the middle to media plaudits with gop conservatives left out in the cold _meta_end_dot_

 rudy while he s mistrusted by the right on some discrete issues isn t like that he s more naturally a polarizing figure who is likely to pick a lot of fights with the democrats just because that s who he is _meta_end_dot_

 but a mccain presidency would likely wear down frustrated conservatives over time _meta_end_dot_

 the fact that he aggravates nearly everyone in the party a little can be papered over for an election season but it will wear as time goes on and wear badly _meta_end_dot_

 mccain will turn _meta_number_ref_ in august he s just a year younger than reagan when he pursued his second term _meta_end_dot_

 it s highly likely that after four years of him either he will wear out and not run for a second term or conservative patience with him will exhaust and lead to a nasty primary battle against an incumbent _meta_end_dot_

 if we line up now behind him we can perhaps avoid splitting the party in this election and the rewards particularly due to mccain s leadership in wartime may well be worth the cost _meta_end_dot_

 but we can t fool ourselves that a mccain nomination wouldn t prevent a schism in the party it would only delay one and perhaps redraw the lines into a more traditional moderates vs _meta_end_dot_

 conservatives battle _meta_end_dot_

 which is one reason why even though i ve been happy for mccain s recent rise even though i may well end up in his camp even though i ve even recently given him money i m not yet ready to throw my support behind the senior senator from arizona _meta_end_dot_

 the mccain temptation puts us to a choice if we follow him into battle today and win we will probably end up fighting him tomorrow _meta_end_dot_

 that may be a deal worth making but it s still a compromise and one on which the bill will eventually come due _meta_end_dot_
