  i m literally speechless well not blogless of course but absolutely speechless now that i ve read this piece at the politico which suggests harry reid believes not only that the surge isn t working but that as one of my oldest and most favored sayings goes i used to be disgusted now i m just amused _meta_end_dot_

 really harry are you feeling ok man _meta_end_question_

 you might want to get that checked before it progresses beyond modern medicine s ability to heal you up and make you all better _meta_end_dot_

 as harry opens the next volley of foolishness in the senate after the holiday break hell bent on keeping up the battle to force a withdrawal and blackmail the president by withholding troop funding he brings us this little gem of insight about military budgets the man is delirious _meta_end_dot_

 i think we ll address it _meta_end_question_

 don t want to look like you caved to bush _meta_end_question_

 good god man how about caving to facts and reality _meta_end_question_

 how did you make majority leader squishy harry _meta_end_question_

 even okinawa jack knows when it s time to shift gears _meta_end_dot_

 more below the fold _meta_end_dot_

 mcconnel offered this omnibus package equals gimme my earmarks and i ll give you your darned war money and everyone sees very clearly through that little game _meta_end_dot_

 i m reminded of a passage in an old song here harry is having some real trouble with reality _meta_end_dot_

 and if ever there was proof that he could care less about doing what s right while he busies himself with getting more moveon and code pink money it s in this little passage wow _meta_end_dot_

 so we ll take it up in december _meta_end_dot_

 they don t need it til march _meta_end_dot_

 the surge isn t working but we ll keep funding it so long as you stop doing it _meta_end_dot_

 my head is spinning but i want whatever it is that man smoked while he was eating thanksgiving turkey _meta_end_dot_
