  raising taxes is an unpopular enterprise so in order to pull it off one has to engage in more than a bit of class warfare _meta_end_dot_

 one has to talk about raising taxes just for the rich or some other such nonsense in order to sell the tax hike this despite the fact that the rich actually pay a huge share of the taxes in this country and that the more such class envy we see in efforts to sell tax hikes the more atlas may shrug _meta_end_dot_

 all of this is a prelude to a discussion of barack obama s tax policy which as stephen moore points out should induce more than a little consternation on the part of readers and voters some point someone should really call the obama campaign on all of this _meta_end_dot_

 they have no idea what rich means _meta_end_dot_

 the standards keep shifting and the obama tax plan will hit rich people who don t qualify as being wealthy under any meaningful definition of the term _meta_end_dot_

 the economic damage this scattershot policy will do will be massive of course _meta_end_dot_

 but fear not _meta_end_exclamation_

 there are certain rich people who actually are rich in every sense of the term and who will do quite well in an obama administration _meta_end_dot_

 read the rest of the moore article to find out who they are _meta_end_dot_

 and here s a hint there shall be no windfall profits tax on them _meta_end_dot_
