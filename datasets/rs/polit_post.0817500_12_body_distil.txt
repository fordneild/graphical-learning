  the biggest danger to sen _meta_end_dot_

 barack obama s campaign comes not from his republican opponent sen _meta_end_dot_

 john mccain nor from his former rival sen _meta_end_dot_

 hillary clinton but from barack obama himself _meta_end_dot_

 obama has sold himself as a new kind of politician even an anti politician a practitioner of a new kind of politics _meta_end_dot_

 the achilles heel of this strategy is that obama is not really that different from other politicians and if he can be shown to be just like every other candidate save for his eloquence voters who invested in him on a personal level may begin to feel like they have been had _meta_end_dot_

 the past week provided obama with a few opportunities to show that he really is a different kind of candidate indeed a different kind of democrat than the standard variety _meta_end_dot_

 but in each instance he espoused the typical liberal position _meta_end_dot_

 read on _meta_end_dot_

 the supreme court s wrongheaded decision in boumediene for the first time granting habeas corpus rights to terrorist detainees was embraced by the different obama as an important step in preserving civil liberties for american citizens _meta_end_dot_

 but the decision has nothing to do with americans _meta_end_dot_

 it grants the rights of americans to non americans who want to harm american citizens but it does not one thing to advance any american s civil liberties _meta_end_dot_

 obama s embrace of the decision may just as well have come from the american civil liberties union human rights watch amnesty international or any other far left liberal watchdog group _meta_end_dot_

 obama missed an opportunity to take a new politics position on terrorists in favor of a garden variety liberal one _meta_end_dot_

 obama then compounded his error by holding out the example of the _meta_number_ref_ world trade center bombing as a model for how an obama administration would deal with terrorists and terrorist acts _meta_end_dot_

 he assessed the trial and conviction of the terrorists in that first islamic terrorist attack on american shores as having been a success _meta_end_dot_

 they are in u s _meta_end_dot_

 prisons incapacitated he boasted of the terrorists responsible _meta_end_dot_

 he did not address how if the trial and conviction of those terrorists was so successful the september _meta_number_ref_th attacks took place _meta_end_dot_

 clearly the trial did nothing to prevent further acts of terrorism on america at home or abroad _meta_end_dot_

 obama missed a chance to take a post september _meta_number_ref_th position on terrorists a more robust one than federal prosecutors can implement in favor of a tired old liberal worldview _meta_end_dot_

 but obama was not finished _meta_end_dot_

 he capped off the week by suggesting that if osama bin laden himself were captured alive during an obama administration the mastermind of the murder of more americans than any other person in history would not be subjected to the death penalty _meta_end_dot_

 obama said that the u s _meta_end_dot_

 should deal with a captured bin laden in a way that does not make him a martyr that may be a popular position in the liberal salons of cambridge and new haven but it is not one that will resonate with an overwhelming majority of americans _meta_end_dot_

 even those personally opposed to capital punishment will have a hard time finding any sympathy for bin laden s soul _meta_end_dot_

 obama could have easily said that bin laden deserved ultimate justice for his crimes or some other suitable euphemism for execution and he would have been praised as a new kind of democrat tough on terrorism _meta_end_dot_

 but instead he went out of his way to take the liberal position even for the worst of america s enemies _meta_end_dot_

 since securing the nomination obama has been trying to tack back to the center walking back pledges to meet personally and unconditionally with the leaders of iran syria north korea cuba and venezuela _meta_end_dot_

 but there s nothing new about that strategy either _meta_end_dot_

 presidential candidates since time immemorial have campaigned to the fringes in the primary and to the center in the general election _meta_end_dot_

 what is new about obama however is the length to which he has gone to convince voters that his greasy fast food served on fine china is really nouveau cuisine _meta_end_dot_

 it s not _meta_end_dot_

 if obama doesn t start to come up with some genuinely new positions and fresh ideas he will lose in november and become just another bitter liberal former nominee _meta_end_dot_
