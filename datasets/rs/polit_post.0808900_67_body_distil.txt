  i wrote about that statement in my blog here in which i called barack a liar for it _meta_end_dot_

 shortly thereafter senator obama delivered his now famous race speech a more perfect union which i wrote about here _meta_end_dot_

 here is an excerpt from the speech today at powerline there s a post up about the senator s first sermon at trinity united church of christ which he wrote about in his autobiography dreams of my father _meta_end_dot_

 this sermon excerpt was also previously discussed at the corner _meta_end_dot_

 read on for an excerpt _meta_end_dot_

 senator obama was inspired by the sermon that day _meta_end_dot_

 he was moved and joined the church _meta_end_dot_

 john at powerline notes by his own account obama wasn t repelled by wright s racism it was the very quality that drew obama to wright s church the senator has yet to move on from that first sermon s theme _meta_end_dot_

 he s blaming greed white racist greed you know for the housing crisis _meta_end_dot_

 yet he would have us believe that he d have left the church if reverend wright had stayed _meta_end_dot_

 why _meta_end_question_

 senator obama never repudiated the message about overarching white racism as the driving motivational force in america _meta_end_dot_

 his speech his blog post and his media statements don t treat that theme derisively or with dismissal or even with the intimation that wright is wrong about it _meta_end_dot_

 just that he ought to have more hope that someday it will change _meta_end_dot_

 he s isn t obama enough that s all _meta_end_dot_

 in his speech about race senator obama used some clever phrasing and a beautiful concept to cover an ugly truth _meta_end_dot_

 twenty years ago young barack obama was inspired by a message _meta_end_dot_

 that message is the same message the wright reverend has preached ever since and its thematic elements are evident in all other aspects of the senator s life _meta_end_dot_

 senator obama can t lead us to a more perfect union or bridge the racial divide _meta_end_dot_

 he doesn t repudiate or condemn reverend wrights divisive worldview _meta_end_dot_

 he has spent twenty years staking a claim to it and figuring out pretty packages with which to deliver it to the white house _meta_end_dot_
