  this was such an inane new york times article that it almost didn t get front paged but the bad thinking it represents is probably widespread _meta_end_dot_

 so let s take a look _meta_end_dot_

 as a fan of the one sentence zinger myself i must note the author almost certainly wished that there could be a knife chord associated with that one _meta_end_dot_

 or at least bolding _meta_end_dot_

 read on _meta_end_dot_

 the author goes on to make the following two statements which sum up her point such as it was and regarding bush s support among congressional republicans let us dispose of those two statements separately _meta_end_dot_

 i suppose that a new york times journalist might have difficulty understanding why somebody in the president s position is not practicing the art of the deal but i trust that the regular readers of this site don t need to have it explained _meta_end_dot_

 still for those wandering in late let me spell it out he s not practicing the art of the deal because he doesn t need to _meta_end_dot_

 he has veto power over legislation he has easily enough legislators on hand to enforce it his party s base has been begging him to find his veto pen for the last six years and he doesn t give a tinker s dam about what the democrats the new york times or the punditry thinks about him _meta_end_dot_

 president bush in other words has gone through lame duck status and out the other side and discovered that there s actually a good bit of power there for somebody who isn t terrified of what the history books will say about him fifty years down the road _meta_end_dot_

 secondly _meta_end_dot_

 um no _meta_end_dot_

 republican congressmen aren t worrying at all about distancing themselves from the president _meta_end_dot_

 he s distancing himself or being distanced or whatever you want to call the process of not running for reelection _meta_end_dot_

 oh i m sure that plenty of people are going to try to hang bush around various congressmen s necks and they re all muttering right now that it worked in _meta_number_ref_ didn t it _meta_end_question_

 only muttering because the new congress turned out to be the same as the old congress only less effectual and they know it and we know it and they know that we know and so on _meta_end_dot_

 besides even the democrats know that running against the guy that isn t even running isn t likely to be the smartest play in the book _meta_end_dot_

 well the establishment democrats at least _meta_end_dot_

 i don t know whether the netroots got that memo _meta_end_dot_

 or believed it if they did _meta_end_dot_

 anyway our author pretty much ends with this line i hesitate to suggest the political affiliations of others but if that isn t a stereotypically democratic process over events kind of statement then i don t know what is _meta_end_dot_

 not true either given that the rest of the article was about how bush was zounds really winning _meta_end_dot_

 moe i d like to thank the netrooters for helping with ensuring that happy state of affairs by the way _meta_end_dot_

 aren t you pleased with what all your money time and burnt photons bought _meta_end_question_
