  first a disclaimer _meta_end_dot_

 i am not writing this in an attempt to rally the conservative troops against or for any candidate rather i m expressing a concern the reason for which has been evincing itself with regularity of late _meta_end_dot_

 talking to a very friendly rich lowry substituting for sean hannity on fnc s hannity colmes thursday evening republican presidential hopeful mitt romney was asked about his lack of foreign policy experience in light of the recent assassination of pakistani opposition leader benazir bhutto _meta_end_dot_

 romney replied that he would consult a team of experts get a broad range of opinion and make his decisions that way _meta_end_dot_

 this reminded me of ross perot in _meta_number_ref_ during his many appearances of cnn s larry king live _meta_end_dot_

 perot completely from memory and he mentioned ronald reagan as an example of a president with no foreign policy experience and he pointed out that reagan won the cold war _meta_end_dot_

 but mitt romney is not like ronald reagan _meta_end_dot_

 read on _meta_end_dot_

 from reagan you got it from his heart from romney one cannot be sure from where it comes _meta_end_dot_

 here s jennifer rubin at the amspec blog this is no time to elect someone who s going to talk to a team of experts whenever a decision must be made just as it is not good to consult a team of attorneys every time you might need to use military force _meta_end_dot_

 beyond that this is another example of romney s tendency to use president reagan as an excuse for his own shortcomings _meta_end_dot_

 another example of this took place last august when fox news sunday host chris wallace asked romney about his dramatic change of opinion on abortion _meta_end_dot_

 romney tried to cover himself by insisting that ronald reagan as governor of california was adamantly pro choice this was a bald faced falsehood _meta_end_dot_

 a candidate worth his salt should be able to answer all questions about his current views and qualifications without invoking another let alone the greatest president of most living people s lifetimes _meta_end_dot_

 anyone remember cal now there is no reason that a conservative would not be able to overlook romney s use of president reagan s name for political purposes but as someone who has admired and followed the doings of the man for longer than i care to admit i am put off by this _meta_end_dot_

 or am i fooling myself when i think of the republican party as the party of reagan _meta_end_question_
