  in the end of the sabbath as it began to dawn toward the first day of the week came mary magdalene and the other mary to see the sepulchre _meta_end_dot_

 and behold there was a great earthquake for the angel of the lord descended from heaven and came and rolled back the stone from the door and sat upon it _meta_end_dot_

 his countenance was like lightning and his raiment white as snow and for fear of him the keepers did shake and became as dead men _meta_end_dot_

 and the angel answered and said unto the women fear not ye for i know that ye seek jesus which was crucified _meta_end_dot_

 he is not here for he is risen as he said _meta_end_dot_

 come see the place where the lord lay _meta_end_dot_

 and go quickly and tell his disciples that he is risen from the dead and behold he goeth before you into galilee there shall ye see him lo i have told you and they departed quickly from the sepulchre with fear and great joy and did run to bring his disciples word _meta_end_dot_

 and as they went to tell his disciples behold jesus met them saying all hail _meta_end_dot_

 and they came and held him by the feet and worshipped him _meta_end_dot_

 matthew _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ happy easter to each and every one of you _meta_end_dot_
