  i ve been officially undecided whether obama assuming that he gets the nomination picking webb for the vp slot is a good idea or a bad one but this roundup of reactions by james joyner to the idea see also ross douthat yglesias guest blogger cathy g the american conservative for a take from a demographic that obama might theoretically want to go after and last but definitely not least beldarblog who would have as much fun with this as i would h t glenn has convinced me if obama gets the nod he should go with james webb _meta_end_dot_

 it ll be a gas _meta_end_dot_

 we have years and years of the man s comments and observations and while his convenient apostasy may have been acceptable for a virginia senate campaign webb will not be able to run as a stealth republican in the general election _meta_end_dot_

 he ll be the running mate of a man who has code pink leader jodie evans bundling for him via melanie morgan it is not only acceptable but actually necessary to pin the man down on whether he was lying then or lying now about what he believes in _meta_end_dot_

 and the really funny part is you know that temper thing that democrats keep trying to pin on mccain _meta_end_question_

 yeah well let s just say that jim webb may not be exactly the most phlegmatic guy in the world and leave it at that _meta_end_dot_

 so by all means senator obama please go with this guy _meta_end_dot_

 please _meta_end_dot_

 moe lane this one requires special note kathy g brings up that wonderfully embarrassing washingtonian piece that webb had to apologize to women for grudgingly during his senatorial run _meta_end_dot_

 unfortunately for webb he didn t also apologize to the vietnam antiwar movement for similar comments _meta_end_dot_

 which means that it s still fair game how do we know that he meant it and you can expect that it and other little comments_meta_beep_ref_ will be brought up a lot just to see how many blood vessels jim webb will pop from the strain of having to plausibly disavow a decade s worth of hurtful and hateful comments towards progressives _meta_end_dot_

 and not to give advice to progressives but really you guys should make him crawl _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_beep_ref_so how do you feel about hanoi jane ms _meta_end_dot_

 fonda these days senator _meta_end_question_

 seeing as you re both on the same side now and all _meta_end_dot_
