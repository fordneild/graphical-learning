  ignoring _meta_number_ref_ schedule house democrats will take even more time off next year if you believe the check is in the mail and i m from the government and here to help then you probably believe democrats now year old promise that the _meta_end_dot_

 when the house returned this week from a two week long vacation they were greeted with an important announcement _meta_end_dot_

 majority leader steny hoyer d md on monday released the congressional calendar for _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 the less rigorous schedule is fitting and a bit more realistic since the democrat s promised five day workweek is one of the greatest myths perpetuated in the _meta_number_ref_th congress according to research conducted by the majority accountability project majorityap com _meta_end_dot_

 before the start of this year s session democrats were adamant the new congress would begin working longer hours including instituting five day workweeks _meta_end_dot_

 i have bad news for you hoyer told reporters according to a washington post story appearing exactly one year ago _meta_end_dot_

 those trips you had planned in january forget _meta_number_ref_ em _meta_end_dot_

 we will be working almost every day in january starting with the _meta_number_ref_th they didn t _meta_end_dot_

 in fact congress was in session only _meta_number_ref_ days the entire month of january _meta_end_dot_

 their average is even more abysmal _meta_end_dot_

 hoyer s _meta_number_ref_ schedule promised _meta_number_ref_ five day workweeks but only twice in march and july did they keep to that schedule _meta_end_dot_

 they are the only two months congress actually kept to its schedule although in july hoyer promised to be in session for fifteen total days _meta_end_dot_

 according to the year old post story hoyer and other democratic leaders say they are trying to repair the image of congress which was so anemic this year it could not meet a basic duty to approve spending bills that fund government with a new budget year more two months old hoyer finds himself in that same predicament _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ largely symbolic votes on the iraq war only twice have they voted to send an appropriation bill to president bush _meta_end_dot_

 just one spending bill has been signed into law a _meta_number_ref_ defense package _meta_end_dot_

 but appropriations congress most basic duty are not the democrat majority s only year end problems _meta_end_dot_

 a recent article in the hill newspaper reports they also need to complete work on a patch of the alternative minimum tax amt a bicameral energy bill the stalled farm bill a bill to overhaul the foreign intelligence surveillance act and a free trade agreement with peru despite not meeting targets the house s schedule remains contentious among rank and file members _meta_end_dot_

 jason altmire d pa openly complained to poltico com _meta_end_dot_

 when that article appeared october _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ the house had completed only six five day workweeks _meta_end_dot_

 to their credit democrats succeeded in advancing the fallacy of a five day workweek even though official house records offer proof to the contrary _meta_end_dot_

 in commenting on hoyer s _meta_number_ref_ pledge of a five day workweek politico com wrote this week hoyer delivered on that promise but even with a shorter schedule than planned some house democrats are still unable to meet their responsibilities _meta_end_dot_
