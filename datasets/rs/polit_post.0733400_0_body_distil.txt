  i did not watch the debate _meta_end_dot_

 but from reading far too many reviews live bloggings etc it seems that one major conclusion was that fred didn t help his case much _meta_end_dot_

 fred is behind in all early states despite having a national following that keeps him tied for second depending on the poll _meta_end_dot_

 of the big _meta_number_ref_ fred is in the worst position with having a path to ultimate victory _meta_end_dot_

 huck is gunning for ia mccain could pull out nh romney is ahead in both and giuliani has the money and name recognition to try to last until super tuesday _meta_end_dot_

 fred doesn t have a viable path _meta_end_dot_

 fred s answer to the vp question also sounded a lot link he was describing _meta_end_dot_

 fred _meta_end_dot_

 fred is the least experienced politically of the candidates one senate term no major executive experience _meta_end_dot_

 of the crowd he would make a good vp for several other candidates _meta_end_dot_

 if fred picked his horse to ride and endorsed one of the other _meta_number_ref_ candidates he could put himself in a good position to be a strong vp choice _meta_end_dot_

 it is no small secret that thompson and mccain are good friends and have very similar political views _meta_end_dot_

 a mccain endorsement would make a lot of sense _meta_end_dot_

 but hooking himself to romney rudy or huckabee would be possible as well _meta_end_dot_

 the one way thompson can ensure going back to paul harvey radio and nothing else is letting his slow paced implosion continue _meta_end_dot_

 and for the record fred is still on the short list of _meta_number_ref_ for my primary vote _meta_end_dot_
