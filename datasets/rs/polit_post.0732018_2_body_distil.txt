  democrats continued delay on amt will cost millions of americans billions of dollars _meta_end_dot_

 starting right now _meta_end_dot_

 if there s wisdom in the old saying neither a borrower nor a lender be at least half of it appears to have been lost on democrats in this congress _meta_end_dot_

 yesterday by doing something they hurried through a sub prime mortgage bill that will make it tougher for millions of american to secure a home loan _meta_end_dot_

 and today by doing nothing they ve effectively converted another _meta_number_ref_ million americans into money lenders _meta_end_dot_

 the only problem _meta_end_question_

 their sole client will be the federal government and the highest interest rate they can expect to receive on their money is zero _meta_end_dot_

 oh and they have no choice in the matter _meta_end_dot_

 much has been made about how the alternative minimum tax amt is set to ensnare six times as many taxpayers this year as were forced to pay it in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 and for good reason _meta_end_dot_

 after all the tax was conceived by democrats in the _meta_number_ref_s as a way to make sure a couple wealthy families paid their fair share _meta_end_dot_

 that the tax s original architects chose not to account for inflation and wage growth in creating the formula wasn t seen as a big deal then _meta_end_dot_

 nearly _meta_number_ref_ years later a tax originally designed to target _meta_number_ref_ households is set to swallow up _meta_number_ref_ million americans _meta_end_dot_

 read on _meta_end_dot_

 but not nearly as much has been said about how democrats continued and willful delinquency in crafting an amt fix will impact the rest of the tax paying public _meta_end_dot_

 these people may not know it but today represents their day of judgment _meta_end_dot_

 according to both the treasury department and the internal revenue service irs today november _meta_number_ref_th is the latest possible stage at which congress could intervene to help head off what now promises to be an epic delay in processing this year s tax returns _meta_end_dot_

 why is that so important _meta_end_question_

 simply stated even if the liberal democratic leadership decides to finally join republicans to fix the amt later this year millions of american families that were expecting to receive a refund early next year won t see that money for months _meta_end_dot_

 that means a new car a new washing machine or a family vacation that will have to wait or be put off altogether for people counting on that refund check _meta_end_dot_

 but don t worry at least a few groups extract a clear benefit from this delay the federal government and those in congress who clamor for more government spending _meta_end_dot_

 as rep _meta_end_dot_

 jim mccrery the top republican tax writer on the house ways and means committee has warned all year a delay of any length would essentially amount to an interest free loan extended to the federal government from as many as _meta_number_ref_ million unsuspecting taxpayers _meta_end_dot_

 worse yet the irs is now suggesting the terms of this sweetheart loan deal may be extended for an additional two and a half months the period of back log time the irs believes will be created by democrats unwillingness to pass a clean bill _meta_end_dot_

 so just how much will middle class families be obliged to loan uncle sam interest free this holiday season _meta_end_question_

 try on _meta_dollor_ref_ billion for size _meta_end_dot_

 seventy five billion dollars in interest free loans extended to the federal government from the first national bank of the american taxpayer _meta_end_dot_

 this point though essential has attracted little more than a collective yawn from the mainstream media _meta_end_dot_

 this is true despite months of persistent and pointed warnings from the irs that all its essential forms must be sent to print by this afternoon _meta_end_dot_

 should democrats get their act together and pass an amt patch after that according to the irs it d be a positive development _meta_end_dot_

 but in the best case it d still force the agency to gather up all the old forms destroy them print new ones and send them out to taxpayers once again _meta_end_dot_

 in a country of _meta_number_ref_ million not a bit of that is cheap _meta_end_dot_

 and as the bill grows each and every day the democrats continue with their delay it ll be hard working american families who are called upon to settle it _meta_end_dot_

 as usual _meta_end_dot_

 republicans have a better plan to address the indiscriminate reach of amt _meta_end_dot_

 and here it is abolish it _meta_end_dot_

 abolish it without raising new taxes on anyone else _meta_end_dot_

 abolish it while reminding democrats they can t consider revenue lost if they were never entitled to it in the first place _meta_end_dot_

 abolish it because it s bad policy that s far outlived its usefulness if it ever had any at all _meta_end_dot_

 and abolish it to send an unambiguous message that if this majority hopes to run on a platform of fiscal responsibility it ll have to find programs to cut and money to return to its rightful owners not just more illegitimate revenue with which to sate itself _meta_end_dot_

 if democrats came at this issue the same way we do i imagine we could get it squared away and off the table by this afternoon _meta_end_dot_

 as it is expect a long cold winter of discontent in the offices of the irs _meta_end_dot_

 and come springtime absolutely don t expect your refund checks to arrive when they should _meta_end_dot_
