 george mitchell on fns _meta_end_dot_

 george mitchell who sits on the board of directors of the boston red sox and is a part owner of that team was the first guest of fox news sunday host chris wallace who at the end of the interview admitted that he was a red sox fan _meta_end_dot_

 he began the interview by quizzing mitchell about new york yankees pitcher andy pettitte one of the players mentioned to mitchell s team by some unsavory characters who were threatened with longer jail sentences if they didn t start talking _meta_end_dot_

 andy has come clean and admitted to his fans that he used hgh twice in _meta_number_ref_ to try to overcome an injury and get back to his job _meta_end_dot_

 he added that he had never taken steroids wallace asked mitchell if pettitte s confession were proof that roger clemens was also guilty as charged by mitchell _meta_end_dot_

 that slug mitchell agreed and further proclaimed that pettitte s confession validated his entire report _meta_end_dot_

 when asked by wallace why he would print a list of names of ballplayers against whom he had no proof of steroid use mitchell replied that he did his best to intimidate and blackmail the few people to whom he talked using threats and intimidation into naming names and telling the truth mitchell said that he invited every major league ballplayer without telling them if they had been named to meet with and confess to him and clear their names a form of blackmail but no one paid any attention to him _meta_end_dot_

 at this point mitchell and host wallace celebrated their world champion boston red sox and mitchell said that he would attend more ballgames this season than last because he no longer had to work long hours on this report _meta_end_dot_

 mitchell expressed fear if skepticism turns to cynicism people might turn away nice work with that mitchell _meta_end_dot_

 harman and hoekstra on fns _meta_end_dot_

 from the house intelligence committee democrat jane harman and republican pete hoekstra were wallace s next guests _meta_end_dot_

 they were on to talk about the destroyed cia vid _meta_end_dot_

 harman does not want a special prosecutor counsel involved just yet as congress was an independent branch of government and could handle the investigation itself _meta_end_dot_

 she pointed out that she had warned the cia not to destroy that vid _meta_end_dot_

 she doesn t buy the cia s proclaimed reason for destroying the vid protecting the interrogators and questioned why they made the vid in the first place _meta_end_dot_

 hoekstra was not satisfied that the cia acted in good faith _meta_end_dot_

 hoekstra has a problem with the intelligence community he said calling them incompetent arrogant and political he complained that they think they are not accountable to anyone _meta_end_dot_

 harman said that the rank and file cia op was a nice person but the leadership was arrogant _meta_end_dot_

 she proclaimed that the most recent nie on iran was among their best work and the reason could only be that it vaguely and with caveats backed a conclusion which her dem friends could use against the bush administration _meta_end_dot_

 they talked a little about waterboarding _meta_end_dot_

 harman believes john mccain that it is torture and she referred to this arrogant administration mitt romney on mtp _meta_end_dot_

 host tim russert s sole guest on nbc s meet the press was mitt romney _meta_end_dot_

 to start things off russert asked romney about the freedom requires religion quip from that texas speech _meta_end_dot_

 can you have freedom without organized religion romney replied that he was paraphrasing john adams who had said that our system of government would require morality and freedom to survive _meta_end_dot_

 he said that we need morality and that religion is part of the foundation of that morality _meta_end_dot_

 he added that the founders recognized that the creator was an instrumental part of the founding of this nation he wants this taught in school _meta_end_dot_

 russert posited that atheists can also be moral and romney agreed prompting russert to point out that freedom doesn t require religion mitt said that he was speaking in the context of john adams _meta_end_dot_

 romney said that he would appoint atheists and agnostics to the supreme court if they were the most qualified _meta_end_dot_

 russert brought up an old issue of sunstone magazine a mormon publication which said that romney discussed his possible presidential run with the man he admires most in the world mormon president gordon bitner hinckley russert asked if voters should be concerned that he was seeking advice from the leader of the mormon church _meta_end_dot_

 romney said he made the decision to run by himself and his family _meta_end_dot_

 he talked about our nation s problems and how he had experience outside government but that he s happy to get as much advice as he can from anyone he can _meta_end_dot_

 he never mentioned the man he most admires _meta_end_dot_

 russert asked him about the support he received from bob jones who says that mormonism is not a form of christianity but rather a cult _meta_end_dot_

 he asked romney about the mormon church s reluctant acceptance of blacks into the full church in _meta_number_ref_ when mitt was _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 he wondered why romney didn t question his membership in a discriminatory organization _meta_end_dot_

 romney said that he is very proud of his faith _meta_end_dot_

 he loves it and he s not going to distance himself from it _meta_end_dot_

 but his dad marched with martin luther king jr _meta_end_dot_

 he said that when he learned of the change in church policy he pulled off the road and wept _meta_end_dot_

 finally campaign stuff _meta_end_dot_

 russert asked about romney s remaking of himself _meta_end_dot_

 russert had moderated romney s _meta_number_ref_ gubernatorial debate and asked him about abortion _meta_end_dot_

 today he played a clip of romney at that debate telling a little story about why women should have the right to choose abortion _meta_end_dot_

 he played another clip of romney in the _meta_number_ref_ debate with ted kennedy in which romney promised that we would not see him wavering on his support for abortion _meta_end_dot_

 why the change _meta_end_question_

 romney told the story that he has always opposed abortion but wondered about the role of government _meta_end_dot_

 then the theoretical he said became reality and a cloning bill crossed his desk _meta_end_dot_

 he brought in people from around the country to talk to him he said and he realized that he could not be a part of an effort that would destroy human life romney believes that from a political perspective life begins at conception romney pointed out that he kept his promise not to take away abortion rights in massachusetts rather he refused to expand them _meta_end_dot_

 romney said he sometimes disagrees with the nra but he s a member _meta_end_dot_

 he blamed opponents for trying to find any change in his position regarding guns _meta_end_dot_

 he signed the assault weapons ban he reminded russert but it was one which he said really expanded gun rights _meta_end_dot_

 he asked for the nra s support _meta_end_dot_

 asked about the brady bill romney ducked by saying that it had changed over time so he didn t know if he supported it _meta_end_dot_

 romney has also of course changed over time he favors background checks but he doesn t want a waiting period of the background can be checked instantly _meta_end_dot_

 romney wants to ban guns which he thinks are of unusual lethality he did not define the term russert quoted an article in the baltimore sun march _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ in which he supported a path toward citizenship for illegal aliens similar to the one recently pushed by the president and john mccain _meta_end_dot_

 romney said that at the time of the article he had not yet formulated his own plan for illegal aliens and that he did not support any of the others _meta_end_dot_

 he had merely called them reasonable russert played a clip of romney recently on the campaign trail praising ronald reagan and then he played a clip of an angry mitt romney debating ted kennedy disavowing president reagan _meta_end_dot_

 romney said that it was a long shot against ted kennedy but he ran as a conservative _meta_end_dot_

 russert asked him if he could be elected governor of massachusetts under the platform he currently espouses while running for president _meta_end_dot_

 romney said that the only position which has changed since then is abortion _meta_end_dot_

 romney for a moment looked to be as angry talking to russert as he did in the old film clip _meta_end_dot_

 then he resumed his smiling _meta_end_dot_

 romney called mittcare a great plan but said that he is a federalist and would not apply it against every state _meta_end_dot_

 he said he would give states the flexibility they need to offer universal health care _meta_end_dot_

 romney said that he would give the states some carrots and sticks to try to coerce them into adopting universal health care _meta_end_dot_

 the interview went much like this with romney holding up well under some relatively discomforting questioning _meta_end_dot_

 fred thompson on face the nation _meta_end_dot_

 on cbs host bob schieffer s first guest was _meta_number_ref_ republican presidential hopeful fred thompson just about to ramp it up in iowa _meta_end_dot_

 thompson said he is concentrating on iowa because the state is where it s at right now he will make five scheduled stops a day in a bus plus he promised some unscheduled stops _meta_end_dot_

 thompson will talk about why he s running _meta_end_dot_

 the role of the federal government he mentioned _meta_end_dot_

 at tax time the burden of proof is on the federal government to prove that your money belongs in their coffers defending his campaign thompson told schieffer that he s doing well in south carolina _meta_end_dot_

 perhaps contrasting himself with mitt romney thompson said that he is not going to change his message or try to be something he s not and he promised that the pundits are wrong about as often as they are right _meta_end_dot_

 schieffer asked him about the rise of mike huckabee and fred did not know why he rose of if this rise will be merely a blip fred said that now huckabee is being forced to come forward and talk about his record and huckabee s record shows that he is liberal on immigration on taxes on castro on the current gitmo camp _meta_end_dot_

 schieffer asked thompson what he would do about the _meta_number_ref_ million illegal aliens who will be here after we ve tightened the borders etc _meta_end_dot_

 thompson started with what you don t do and that s grant them citizenship just because they are here _meta_end_dot_

 he thinks that if we enforce the borders required employers to employ modern technology to see who they re hiring and cut off federal funding they would leave _meta_end_dot_

 he did not suggest rounding them up and deporting or incarcerating them _meta_end_dot_

 let them know that they won t receive benefits and won t be protected from the law _meta_end_dot_

 schieffer asked thompson why people should select him over governor romney thompson said that there was no way you could determine how mitt would govern in the future but with him fdt he is who he is a solid conservative _meta_end_dot_

 schieffer urged thompson to attack both huckabee and romney _meta_end_dot_

 thompson bit the bait more with huck than with romney _meta_end_dot_

 john edwards on ftn _meta_end_dot_

 edwards was up next and schieffer pointed out that edwards was on the cover of newsweek but that the des moines register had endorsed hillary _meta_end_dot_

 edwards said that the register did not endorse him because he wants to fight big corporations while the paper wants to work with them _meta_end_dot_

 for their part the newspaper says that edwards is not as positive as he was in _meta_number_ref_ and he will not be able to work with the business community _meta_end_dot_

 edwards blamed pharmaceutical companies insurance companies oil companies gas companies etc _meta_end_dot_

 he said you have to be willing to work with congress and fight the vested interests schieffer asked edwards how he gets anything done if he won t compromise _meta_end_dot_

 edwards said he will compromise with congress but have to be willing to fight large corporations and beat them _meta_end_dot_

 they are in a position of power he blamed big corporations for killing hillarycare in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 edwards says he has huge crowds at every single event edwards said that barack obama was not prepared to be president _meta_end_dot_

 he didn t use those words mind you rather when schieffer asked him about obama edwards said that people had to ask themselves if any candidate was prepared to take on the office etc _meta_end_dot_

 joe biden on le _meta_end_dot_

 blitzer first talked to _meta_number_ref_ dem presidential hopeful joe biden about the destroyed vid _meta_end_dot_

 joe biden blamed the bush justice department accusing them of destroying the vid and promoting waterboarding _meta_end_dot_

 joe biden reiterated that we need a special counsel joe biden said that the justice department was politicized and should not be used as an investigative tool joe biden suggested that president bush might have ordered that the tapes be destroyed _meta_end_dot_

 we don t know how high this goes blitzer pointed out that jay rockefeller said that they do not need a special counsel _meta_end_dot_

 joe biden said that jay is a heck of a guy but he proves his point _meta_end_dot_

 the justice department will give them nothing _meta_end_dot_

 joe biden said he does not have confidence in the president the vice president or the justice department _meta_end_dot_

 joe biden does not have confidence in pervez musharraf despite the pakistani president having lifted the state of emergency _meta_end_dot_

 he said that we should continue to pressure musharraf to let everyone campaign for this election _meta_end_dot_

 he said that the election was not fair as there had been no time to campaign _meta_end_dot_

 blitzer played a clip of president bush saying that musharraf has been a reliable partner in the war on terror _meta_end_dot_

 joe biden disagreed _meta_end_dot_

 he said that musharraf had been no help in waziristan _meta_end_dot_

 they ve done the bare minimum blitzer told joe biden that the house leadership nancy and harry showed a lack of patriotism by not wanting our military to succeed _meta_end_dot_

 joe biden frowned and said that nancy and harry were great patriots and that the surge has not produced political stability in iraq _meta_end_dot_

 he once again as he has for the past six years announced that there is some breathing room if the president follows his instructions right now _meta_end_dot_

 kit bond and evan bayh on le _meta_end_dot_

 republican senator kit bond of missouri was in the studio and blitzer told him that joe biden didn t trust attorney general mike mukasey and thought there should be a special counsel to investigate the cia vid destruction as the senate wasn t doing anything about it _meta_end_dot_

 bond countered that they ve been holding hearings calling witnesses _meta_end_dot_

 he suggested that there might be criminal investigations of people in the cia _meta_end_dot_

 he expressed confidence in mukasey and blasted biden for taking a shot against anyone in the administration simply because that s what democrats do _meta_end_dot_

 democrat senator evan bayh of indiana said that the witnesses they ve called have all claimed no knowledge of anything _meta_end_dot_

 he suggested that there might be nothing illegal on any of the tapes but the way the justice department is handling it makes it appear that there is _meta_end_dot_

 bond warned against calling witnesses who are under criminal investigation _meta_end_dot_

 we don t want to get in the middle of a criminal prosecution he said that they will call anyone else _meta_end_dot_

 bayh wants to see if the committees can do their jobs because he s not a big fan of special counsels both bond and bayh agree that it was a mistake to destroy the tapes _meta_end_dot_

 bayh wants to know why rodriguez destroyed the tapes when his superiors had ordered him not to do it _meta_end_dot_

 he wonders if the superiors orders were more a wink and a nod indeed a nod s as good as a wink to a blind bat bayh explained what he read in the nie _meta_end_dot_

 they ve stopped warheads and such but they are still creating fissile material at the same rate _meta_end_dot_

 he said that it has only delayed the day of reckoning when iran has nukes _meta_end_dot_

 bond agreed with bayh and pointed out that iran is working on a missile which could deliver the bomb _meta_end_dot_

 it s unfortunate he said that the lead paragraph was that they ve stopped he said that there is no rush to take military action adding that this is a figment of the imaginations of those dems running for president blitzer asked if there were a hidden agenda in writing the report _meta_end_dot_

 bayh doesn t think so but he added that it is unfortunate that it gave the impression that iran had stopped its nuclear program _meta_end_dot_

 bayh suggested that they were being overly cautious after their inaccurate intelligence on iran _meta_end_dot_

 contrast bayh s suggestion that the latest nie was sloppy with jane harman s proclamation on fns that it was their best _meta_end_dot_

 huckabee on le _meta_end_dot_

 blitzer brought up that huckabee has ventured into foreign affairs with his article in foreign policy mag and that huckabee slammed the president with the arrogant bunker mentality etc _meta_end_dot_

 huckabee said that the only people who are complaining are those who have spent millions of dollars to become president and now find themselves behind _meta_end_dot_

 huckabee stands by what he said and he suggested that we can t just tell people that they re either before us or against us _meta_end_dot_

 we have to work with others _meta_end_dot_

 blitzer brought up romney s objections and claims that huckabee owes bush an apology _meta_end_dot_

 huckabee reminded that he was with the president when we went into iraq _meta_end_dot_

 he was for the president s tax cuts when romney opposed them _meta_end_dot_

 he was with the president his father with ronald reagan when romney was not _meta_end_dot_

 ouch _meta_end_exclamation_

 huckabee said that he believes in letting the commanders develop battlefield tactics not trying to do it politically _meta_end_dot_

 huckabee congratulated john mccain for getting the des moines register endorsement but that the editors do not know him as well as they know mccain _meta_end_dot_

 blitzer quoted national review editor rich lowry blasting huckabee for being as unprepared as was howard dean _meta_end_dot_

 huckabee predicted that the chattering class will think he s great when he s the nominee but he cares more about what the people think than what they do _meta_end_dot_

 he laughed off the wall street and washington chattering class he said that he has actually worked with people and gotten things done _meta_end_dot_

 blitzer asked huckabee about romney s complaints about huckabee s pardon record _meta_end_dot_

 huckabee replied that romney did not want to tell us that huckabee has done what romney never did as governor _meta_end_dot_

 he s actually used the death penalty _meta_end_dot_

 he lowered his state s crime rate and though he has made mistakes he has apologized for them and moved on _meta_end_dot_

 a nice performance by huckabee as well _meta_end_dot_

 have at it _meta_end_exclamation_
