  everyone has heard that rudy and edwards are dropping out of the race _meta_end_dot_

 this leaves two person races on both sides of the aisle clinton obama and mccain romney _meta_end_dot_

 this has two major effects on the race _meta_number_ref_ there will be no brokered convention _meta_end_dot_

 period _meta_end_dot_

 i always thought the media overplayed this possibility as did supporters of candidates who were losing and grasping for hope _meta_end_dot_

 before i thought it would take _meta_number_ref_ credible candidates for a party on super tuesday splitting the vote to take enough delegates off the table for a brokered convention to occur _meta_end_dot_

 now we have just _meta_number_ref_ people on both sides for super tuesday _meta_end_dot_

 i expected we would have _meta_number_ref_ and then _meta_number_ref_ after super tuesday _meta_end_dot_

 then it would have been highly unlikely _meta_end_dot_

 but now even if huck wins _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ delegates the odds of a _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_percent_ref_ breakdown is low enough to stop everyone from talking about it _meta_end_dot_

 if edwards had stayed in he could win _meta_number_ref_ _meta_percent_ref_ everywhere and win _meta_percent_ref_ of delegates _meta_end_dot_

 it would have been unlikely but possible for a brokered convention but more likely he would drop under the _meta_percent_ref_ threshold for delegates in d primaries as time went on _meta_end_dot_

 now it s impossible _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ the odds that mayor bloomberg will run for president is tiny _meta_end_dot_

 intrade odds went from _meta_percent_ref_ to _meta_percent_ref_ over the last _meta_number_ref_ hours based on mccain s win and rudy s loss _meta_end_dot_

 maybe the media will stop covering his ego fueled speculation until he actual throws his hat in the ring _meta_end_dot_

 and that isn t happening _meta_end_dot_

 the next president of the united states will be clinton mccain obama or romney _meta_end_dot_

 and the odds are in that order _meta_end_dot_
