  i m listening in on the john mccain conference call _meta_end_dot_

 mccain says that like in iowa negative ads by mitt romney will not work _meta_end_dot_

 he thinks that romney is going to go more negative _meta_end_dot_

 mccain s response will be to go back on romney with what both boston newspaper and both major new hampshire newspapers have said about romney _meta_end_dot_

 i asked john mccain about governor romney raising fees in massachusetts by _meta_dollor_ref_ million _meta_end_dot_

 he said that whether they were fees or taxes raising fees had the same effect as on the pocketbook as raising taxes _meta_end_dot_

 i pointed out that both he and mitt romney were less than supportive of the bush tax cuts _meta_end_dot_

 he said that he supports tax cuts never voted for a tax increase but wanted tax cuts tied to spending cuts _meta_end_dot_

 he was insistent on that point _meta_end_dot_

 on the issue of going negative soren dayton asked him about romney s ads _meta_end_dot_

 again though mccain said he was just going to stand behind what the newspapers had said and he himself would not go negative _meta_end_dot_

 matt lewis from townhall asked about going after independents with obama and would that hurt him _meta_end_dot_

 mccain first pointed out that it was only obama and mccain going after independents _meta_end_dot_

 he said he does not think it will hurt him as there will also be a good number of independents and republicans who support him voting in new hampshire _meta_end_dot_

 he also admitted to matt that his bus is much more crummy this time around not enough room for all the bloggers _meta_end_dot_

 then i had to jump off for another call _meta_end_dot_

 all in all though mccain sounds charged and ready to win _meta_end_dot_

 we ll see on tuesday _meta_end_dot_
