  for those of you who missed it elsewhere just to summarize duncan hunter is focusing on new hampshire and wyoming which caucuses saturday rather than pack it in after drawing _meta_percent_ref_ of the vote in iowa which he was largely ignoring _meta_end_dot_

 presumably hunter will end his pointless campaign by next wednesday and focus on positioning himself to be the next secretary of defense a job for which he is well qualified although i m not really sure who he would be liklely to endorse at this stage _meta_end_dot_

 joe biden and chris dodd have returned to their day jobs in the senate _meta_end_dot_

 dodd s campaign never did get the wave of momentum he expected from announcing his candidacy on the don imus show _meta_end_dot_

 hunter along with dennis kucinich and mike gravel will be barred from the next round of debates hosted by abc _meta_end_dot_

 abc s press release doesn t even mention alan keyes _meta_end_dot_

 i haven t yet seen evidence that keyes is even on the ballot in key states _meta_end_dot_

 thus the next debates will feature huckabee mccain romney giuliani thompson and paul on the gop side and obama clinton edwards and richardson on the democrat side _meta_end_dot_
