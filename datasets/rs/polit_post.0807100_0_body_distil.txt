  following up on the story we ve all been talking about since the recent decision _meta_end_dot_

 for more on what you can do about this go here for hslda s petition _meta_end_dot_

 less than two weeks ago a california appeals court declared in in re rachel l _meta_end_dot_

 that the vast majority of parents in california may only choose between public and private school because they are unqualified to teach their children _meta_end_dot_

 tens of thousands of children in california are currently homeschooled but this fact was unconvincing for these three judges who boldly proclaimed that parents do not have a constitutional right to home school their children unless they are certified by the state to teach _meta_end_dot_

 in so ruling the court declined to follow the supreme court s _meta_number_ref_ decision in wisconsin v _meta_end_dot_

 yoder and its _meta_number_ref_ ruling in troxel v _meta_end_dot_

 granville relying instead upon two antiquated lower court decisions _meta_end_dot_

 the california court refused to recognize parental rights as fundamental rights even though the supreme court did in troxel opting instead for the more lenient pro government standard of reasonableness according to the court homeschooling could not be a legitimate educational option because it would place an unreasonable burden on the state to have to supervise each and every home in which a child was being educated how do you like that _meta_end_question_

 read on _meta_end_dot_

 the danger of rachel l _meta_end_dot_

 is it presumes that it is ultimately the state s duty to ensure that the child s right to adequate information is respected _meta_end_dot_

 it makes the dramatic shift from parents being presumed to be doing what is best for their children to parents having to prove to the state they are doing what is best for their children _meta_end_dot_

 this presumption is evident from the language of rachel l _meta_end_dot_

 itself as well as the two cases the california court relied upon _meta_end_dot_

 in _meta_number_ref_ the new hampshire supreme court declared in state v _meta_end_dot_

 hoyt that because the state bears the burden of reasonable supervision of education parents must choose educational facilities which do not require unreasonable supervision by the state _meta_end_dot_

 a california appeals court used this same language in _meta_number_ref_ when it concluded that children must be educated in traditional public or private schools subject to state standards and regulations anything else would take from the state all efficient authority to regulate the education of the prospective voting population emphasis added parents not the state have the knowledge and the responsibility to decide whether their children would best benefit from public schooling a private school or even learning at home _meta_end_dot_

 unless abuse has been proven parents are presumed to be acting in the best interest of their children _meta_end_dot_

 the supreme court affirmed this important idea in parham v _meta_end_dot_

 j r _meta_end_dot_

 when it said the law s concept of the family rests on a presumption that parents possess what a child lacks in maturity experience and capacity for judgment required for making life s difficult decisions _meta_end_dot_

 more important historically it has recognized that natural bonds of affection lead parents to act in the best interests of their children the anti child anti parent statists certainly affirm the child s lack of maturity experience and capacity for judgment but they solve that problem by inserting government to make those difficult decisions who is the ultimate loser under this scenario _meta_end_question_

 ultimately it will be children because children need their parents _meta_end_dot_

 rightly everyone is up in arms over this case _meta_end_dot_

 the home school legal defense association is working to drive a petition to get this decision depublished in california _meta_end_dot_

 james dobson used his radio program on friday to alert his listeners _meta_end_dot_

 governor schwarzenegger declared that parents should have the right to decide what s best for their children while the issue is homeschooling the heart of this case goes to the statement the governor made _meta_end_dot_

 who decides _meta_end_question_

 mom and dad or the state _meta_end_question_

 do parents have a fundamental right to direct the upbringing and education of their children or does the state get to determine what they think is in the child s best interest _meta_end_question_

 while the scotus has consistently ruled in this question on the side of children and parents there are reasons to worry that this would not be the case with today s court _meta_end_dot_

 troxel was the last parental rights case from the court and it was decided in favor of the parental rights doctrine _meta_end_dot_

 the four justice plurality decision included chief justice rhenquist and justices o connor breyer and ginsberg _meta_end_dot_

 surprisingly scalia rejected the parental rights doctrine because it is not explicitly enumerated in the constitution _meta_end_dot_

 if chief justice roberts and justice alito both hold to scalia s view than the parental rights doctrine is in trouble _meta_end_dot_

 and can we really count on breyer and ginsberg to remain on the side of children and parents _meta_end_question_

 if rachel l _meta_end_dot_

 were to eventually make it to the supreme court of the united states there is a high chance that parental rights would lose and nearly _meta_number_ref_ years of good decisions would be undone _meta_end_dot_

 it would be open season for the it takes a village crowd call them the village people if you like and their armies of state sponsored super nannies _meta_end_dot_

 bottom line is we should not be surprised by a lower court decision like rachel l _meta_end_dot_

 and we should expect more decisions against the role of parents in the lives of their children because the village people are on the march _meta_end_dot_

 we need to do what scalia all but explicitly invited us to do in troxel _meta_end_dot_

 we need to move the time honored constitutional parental rights doctrine from an unenumerated right to an explicitly enumerated fundamental right _meta_end_dot_

 we need a parental rights amendment _meta_end_dot_

 we need it not because we love parents but because we love our children and our children need their parents _meta_end_dot_
