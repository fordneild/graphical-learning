  first let s see if you can discern two distinctly different yet equally problematic morsels in this sentence well ok there s really _meta_number_ref_ problems here but high schoolers getting pregnant in the first place has become so kewl nowadays that i figured i d just give up on that one _meta_end_dot_

 consider the notion that healing and bonding with their newborns would be an unexcused absence to begin with _meta_end_dot_

 worse that these students the ones who have singly and solely by their own bad choices made their futures more difficult than any other demographic in america _meta_end_dot_

 would actually demand and sadly be granted a reward for said bad choices _meta_end_dot_

 more below the fold _meta_end_dot_

 these children had children _meta_end_dot_

 thank god they didn t kill them _meta_end_dot_

 so please let s not mangle this news story and let it devolve to some screaming match about abortion and whether allowing them to be liberally handed out whenever an inconvenience comes along might alleviate the fundamental problem here _meta_end_dot_

 birth control is not a new concept and darn near every pregnancy could have been avoided in the first place even acknowledging that abstinence is so out of vogue these days _meta_end_dot_

 with all that said why is it we always seem to immediately leap to hand outs and freebies such that we continue to reward these children by sheltering them from the harsh realities that met them at the hospital door when newborn in tow they went home after delivery _meta_end_question_

 these children face unemployment poverty welfare food stamps and a whole host of government sponsored entitlements _meta_end_dot_

 and we are going to be paying for these kewl single moms and their babies and subsequent progeny for generations _meta_end_dot_

 is that really what we should be doing here _meta_end_question_

 should we further reduce the degree of basic academic health we give these children in public school by giving them _meta_number_ref_ less weeks of it _meta_end_question_

 i say no _meta_end_dot_

 if i were to miss _meta_number_ref_ weeks of school because of say needing an appendectomy i would be given take home assignments _meta_end_dot_

 why are we not doing likewise in these instances _meta_end_question_

 healing and bonding is all fine and dandy but newborns sleep a great deal and while mom is healing she can be reading and writing and doing rithmetic _meta_end_dot_

 four less weeks of an already under challenging workload in many public institutions of taxpayer funded learning only further serves to push mom into a mcdonald s or a wal mart or worse the food stamp lines _meta_end_dot_

 this is pathetic in the first order _meta_end_dot_

 the story continues specialized programs may have merit but they add costs to an already bloated and overcharged system additional counselors and administrators and the like and while i could be made to believe these investments are worthy good old fashioned take home assignments always worked in my day so i can t help but wonder why all these extra layers of infrastructure are needed now _meta_end_dot_

 and i can t help but ask again why don t they just make these excused absences and be done with it _meta_end_question_

 oh that s right it s for the children hmmm _meta_end_dot_

 friendlier _meta_end_question_

 why _meta_end_question_

 the cold cruel world is not going to be friendly to single moms that are insufficiently skilled or educated it is in fact going to spit these girls out and let them fend for themselves at the local social services offices uptown _meta_end_dot_

 what does friendly have to do with anything _meta_end_question_

 there is some modicum of goodness in that last programs focused on keeping them enrolled and continuing to earn credits toward graduation _meta_end_dot_

 so too is there some goodness buried in here about counseling on parenting and birth control though these things might have had more impact had they been done before these children engaged in the sorts of behavior that usually coincides with babies being born but i have a bigger problem than even this whole maternity leave business _meta_end_dot_

 where s the little boy who so gladly offered up his half of this problem _meta_end_question_

 why are we not attending to little johhny or franky as the suzies and sarahs are fighting to stay in school and graduate with some glimmer of hope for theirs and their babies futures _meta_end_question_

 these boys should be paying child support or their parents should be _meta_end_dot_

 they should be helping with child care costs and diapers and formula and pediatric wellness visits _meta_end_dot_

 they are part of the problem and pretending they don t exist or shouldn t be be held accountable again rewards bad behavior _meta_end_dot_

 as i heard a caller suggest on my local talk radio station regarding this story i d bet better than even money that if the parents of these fathers had to shoulder some of the financial burden there d be a whole lot more adult dads taking junior to the local walgreen s or eckerds and a whole lot less of these requests for _meta_number_ref_ weeks maternity leave from the local high school _meta_end_dot_
