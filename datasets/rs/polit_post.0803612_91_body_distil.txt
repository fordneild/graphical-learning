  this is instructive reading for those who believe that hillary clinton has learned anything from her health care reform debacle in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 given the complete failure of her efforts to demonize jim cooper one would think that she would have reached out to him a long time ago to repair the damage that her demonization efforts caused _meta_end_dot_

 instead clinton continues to do her best to ostracize cooper and obviously she continues to hold a grudge against him for having the temerity to offer his own health care plan _meta_end_dot_

 if memory serves and i believe it does the bush administration regularly gets attacked for its supposed my way or the highway approach _meta_end_dot_

 just out of curiosity how is hillary clinton s behavior on this issue any different _meta_end_question_
