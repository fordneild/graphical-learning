  i won t put the stuff above the fold _meta_end_dot_

 you can click the title of this post to go below the fold and see the information but you should know that catholics in michigan are being targeted this weekend to vote against mike huckabee _meta_end_dot_

 one of the chief points made is that huckabee spoke at that church in houston with the decidedly anti catholic senior pastor _meta_end_dot_

 that and a lot of other stuff has been targeted this weekend to catholics throughout michigan _meta_end_dot_

 go below the fold for the text of the flier _meta_end_dot_

 what did mike huckabee do when presented with these vicious statements made by john hagee about catholics and the catholic church _meta_end_question_

 nothing but huckabee did make this very equivocal statement i can t speak for hagee anymore than he could speak for me _meta_end_dot_

 i m sure that there re things i ll say that he disagrees with _meta_end_dot_

 i would certainly never characterize the catholic church as being pro nazi never just imagine if a politician spoke at a church organization which denied the holocaust ever existed said he did not agree with this statement of the church organization but then went on to call the leader of this church organization who made the statement denying the holocaust one of the finest leaders in our nation _meta_end_dot_

 imagine this scenario no longer mike huckabee has put forward this ridiculous line of reasoning _meta_end_dot_

 and to top it off huckabee accepted _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ from hagee for speaking at the church _meta_end_exclamation_

 why did the self anointed authentic pro life candidate in this election mike huckabee accept _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ in _meta_number_ref_ from novo nordisk a company that conducts life destructive embryonic stem cell research _meta_end_question_

 while this story line sounds too salacious to be true mike huckabee did in fact accept _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ from novo nordisk in _meta_number_ref_ a company that is one of the largest embryonic stem cell research firms in the world _meta_end_dot_

 what was the reason for these payments _meta_end_question_

 huckabee accepted the money for consulting services speaking fees _meta_end_dot_

 huckabee accepted this money nonetheless while he was the sitting governor of arkansas _meta_end_dot_

 how can pro lifers trust this man when he has taken so much money for so little actual work from a company that profits from the destruction of human life _meta_end_question_

 simply put they can t _meta_end_dot_

 at minimum why won t mike huckabee return this money _meta_end_question_

 conclusion sadly mike huckabee would seek to divide conservatives and republicans along religious lines for political gain _meta_end_dot_

 while america needs a more robust expression of faith in the public square it does not need a preacher politician who has shown a repeated pattern of dividing people along religious lines _meta_end_dot_

 the shared values of protestants and catholics are too important to risk endangering this important coalition by nominating mike huckabee a candidate who has demonstrated a blind eye to anti catholicism _meta_end_dot_

 michigan catholic voters do you want a president who rubs shoulders with anti catholic bigots _meta_end_question_

 on tuesday january _meta_number_ref_th you have a chance to be heard _meta_end_dot_

 vote against anti catholic bigotry _meta_end_dot_

 vote against mike huckabee _meta_end_dot_
