  in an interview with abc news robin roberts obama takes bill clinton to task over statements that are not factually accurate obama didn t actually say bill clinton is a liar _meta_end_dot_

 he was more polite saying bill s statements aren t factually accurate and are not supported by the facts according to roberts obama was apparently referring to clinton s fairy tale comment and clinton s assertion that nevada union officials backing obama were strong arming members into caucusing for obama _meta_end_dot_

 this is certainly not the first time bill clinton has been accused of failing to tell the truth _meta_end_dot_

 even clinton admitted that answers he gave about ms _meta_end_dot_

 lewinsky during a _meta_number_ref_ deposition were false and that he knowingly gave misleading and evasive answers obama is making a mistake here _meta_end_dot_

 he should not be out front calling bill clinton a liar _meta_end_dot_

 just as hillary is having bill do her dirty work obama should use surrogates to call the former president a liar _meta_end_dot_
