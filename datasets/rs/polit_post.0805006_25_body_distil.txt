  for the first time in my adult lifetime i am really proud of my country said michelle obama rich lawyer and wife of barack hussein same last name yesterday _meta_end_dot_

 excuse me _meta_end_question_

 a female african american princeton and harvard educated attorney who has achieved a great deal in her life who lived through the civil rights revolution and was the daughter of a chicago city worker who really experienced those events and who is married to an african american man who is a u s _meta_end_dot_

 senator has never been proud of her country before _meta_end_question_

 putting that aside for a moment what is it that we ve suddenly done to finally make her proud now _meta_end_question_

 allow her husband to enter a primary that he hasn t even won yet _meta_end_question_

 let me get this straight a couple of ultra successful ivy league educated wealthy elitist liberals who have never been proud of their country want all of us little people to vote for them to be our president and first lady _meta_end_question_

 they want to represent a people and govern a country that has never once ever in their adult lives made them proud _meta_end_question_

 wow _meta_end_dot_

 this utter lack of pride in their country or its people is especially damning in light of the amazing and praiseworthy work that president bush has done for africa during his terms as president especially given the fact that obama still has family there which seems a bit strange given that he is so wealthy and apparently holy and powerful why is his grandmother still living in a hut in a desolate village on the dark continent when her son is this successful in america _meta_end_dot_

 anyway just shut up and vote for barack so that his wife can finally appreciate something you stupid people in this country she is so forcibly made to endure living in have done _meta_end_dot_

 got it _meta_end_question_
