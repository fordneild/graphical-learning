  anyway it would appear via ed morrissey of hot air that we ve got ourselves a blue on blue kind of firefight going on not quite up to five exclamation points yet yup yet one more pratchett reference but give them time _meta_end_dot_

 read on _meta_end_dot_

 i don t often discuss abortion issues here by the standards of a lot of people here i m barely pro life both in my position and in the relative importance in which i hold it but this isn t really about abortion it s about advocacy groups and the people who run them _meta_end_dot_

 it s kind of amusing to see state naral chapters freak out about how the national chapter ignored them given that this is somewhat similar to what union leadership does routinely _meta_end_dot_

 not that naral members want to hear that what happened to them is just like what happens to republican union members all the time _meta_end_dot_

 and not that anybody in naral particularly wants to hear that they re supporting a group whose primary goal in life is now to increase its power in the democratic party _meta_end_dot_

 yes that s pretty much what s happening here _meta_end_dot_

 ed put it best ed also notes that the timing was off on this which is to be expected really naral president nancy keenan has a history of spending her group s political capital unwisely _meta_end_dot_

 i d recommend that naral members do something about that except of course that most of the website including the directors probably would glare at me if i even presumed to try _meta_end_dot_

 moe lane i see no reason to humor beth shipp s excuse of federal legislation prohibiting their consultation or coordination with state groups such things can be worked around _meta_end_dot_

 that they weren t in this case is kind of indicative _meta_end_dot_
