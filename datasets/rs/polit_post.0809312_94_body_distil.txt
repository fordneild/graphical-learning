  as i told you yesterday here the federal reserve s aggressive measures to stabilize the financial system appear to be paying off at least in the near term _meta_end_dot_

 but the scene is shifting to washington as capitol hill democrats hurriedly consider a home mortgage bailout perhaps by expanding the mandate of the federal housing administration fha _meta_end_dot_

 as i wrote here there are very good reasons to oppose a straightforward bailout in which taxpayer funds would provide relief to people who are either unable or unwilling to stay current on their mortgage payments _meta_end_dot_

 if you agree with me today would be a very good day to call your senator and tell him or her about it _meta_end_dot_

 particularly members of the senate banking committee chaired by christopher dodd of connecticut _meta_end_dot_

 the ranking republican is shelby of alabama and mr _meta_end_dot_

 dodd spoke in the senate on this subject yesterday prepared text here _meta_end_dot_

 i warned you that this was coming _meta_end_dot_

 what senator dodd said in essence is this the administration sic just spent _meta_dollor_ref_ billion in taxpayer money to bail out bear stearns _meta_end_dot_

 we re gonna kick their butts for doing that starting tomorrow _meta_end_dot_

 but now that we saved wall street s bacon we have to do the same thing for homeowners more _meta_end_dot_

 senator dodd is an intelligent and knowledgeable guy _meta_end_dot_

 he knows that the federal reserve bank of new york which engineered the orderly demise of the bear stearns companies is not part of the administration strictly speaking _meta_end_dot_

 perhaps he was speaking of the role that treasury secretary hank paulson played but again this was mostly a federal reserve show _meta_end_dot_

 much worse however the bear stearns resolution did not involve the expenditure of _meta_dollor_ref_ billion in taxpayer money _meta_end_dot_

 i explained why not here _meta_end_dot_

 senator dodd was artful enough to use the word commitment rather than expenditure which won t prevent people from mentally substituting the word bailout and as you know the fed used its own balance sheet rather than public funds _meta_end_dot_

 and once more with feeling the fed did its job which was to keep the global financial system from rapidly melting down when bear stearns failed _meta_end_dot_

 they did their job admirably _meta_end_dot_

 and they went out of their way to punish bear stearns by wiping out bear s shareholders _meta_end_dot_

 they did this both to teach wall street a lesson and also because they knew that people like senator dodd would try to portray the situation as a sweet deal extended to rich fatcats _meta_end_dot_

 at any rate the logical progression is clear if we can bail out wall street we can bail out main street _meta_end_dot_

 to senator dodd i m quite confident sir that you re not proposing to give main street the same medicine that wall street got _meta_end_dot_

 as near as i can draw the analogy that would require that you find everyone who s behind on her mortgage seize all of her assets and her obligations and give them to her neighbor at a fire sale price _meta_end_dot_

 please don t insult the intelligence of millions of americans by telling us that wall street got bailed out _meta_end_dot_

 but let s get back to the politics _meta_end_dot_

 to my eyes it appears that the hill democrats are seeing an opportunity to do things they can spin as a solution to the mortgage problem _meta_end_dot_

 senator dodd repeatedly emphasized that action must be taken saying at one point that inaction is not an option _meta_end_dot_

 and frankly sic failure is not an option either leave aside the discovered pun on representative barney frank whose name will also be on the dodd frank homeowner relief act of _meta_number_ref_ you heard it here first what the senator is saying here through artful rhetoric is that the mortgage situation can t be left to resolve itself _meta_end_dot_

 and of course if congress does take action they will be able to take credit for the eventual resolution whether it comes as a result of new legislation or in spite of it _meta_end_dot_

 politics as usual _meta_end_dot_

 and i suspect also a bit of desire to get some of the credit for the good things that the federal reserve has done _meta_end_dot_

 the situation on the ground is quite fluid at this point _meta_end_dot_

 the senate will clearly be busy with this all week _meta_end_dot_

 today will see a marathon round of hearings that will be closely watched on wall street _meta_end_dot_

 called to account for the bear stearns resolution will be fed chairman bernanke new york fed president geithner treasury undersecretary steele and others _meta_end_dot_

 that s the butt kickin i mentioned earlier _meta_end_dot_

 secretary paulson suddenly jetted off to china beyond that there is a strong possibility that the democrats will propose landmark new legislation _meta_end_dot_

 senate republicans will try to hold the line but they need your support because rumors are flying that the treasury department is ready to cut a deal with the democrats _meta_end_dot_

 for a recap of the arguments against a bailout please do re read my piece here _meta_end_dot_

 the administration s program of facilitated private workouts on a case by case basis is working very well _meta_end_dot_

 let s expand that program _meta_end_dot_

 let s not however support an expansion of the fha or of the gse s fannie freddie and ginny that would provide second mortgages or other taxpayer guaranteed relief to homeowners _meta_end_dot_

 when someone asks you why not tell her that there are two sides to any loan the borrower and the lender _meta_end_dot_

 a bailout keeps a homeowner in a house that in many cases she can t really afford and why should the public do that _meta_end_question_

 get her out of that house and into something she can afford which might be a rental and let the housing market find its level _meta_end_dot_

 but even worse the bailout benefits the lender who escapes the financial responsibility for having made a loan that shouldn t have happened in the first place _meta_end_dot_

 and why should we give a huge lollipop to people that are usually described as predatory _meta_end_question_

 these people are professionals _meta_end_dot_

 bailing them out for their mistakes only ensures that they ll try to do the same thing again some other day _meta_end_dot_
