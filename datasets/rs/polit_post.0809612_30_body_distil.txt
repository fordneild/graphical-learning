 mr _meta_end_dot_

 dogg it s all yours i never want this primary to end _meta_end_dot_

 moe lane ps let me be the first person by the way to reassure mr _meta_end_dot_

 dogg in point of fact both john mccain and hillary clinton will find no difficulties in doing what you suggested that they would find it impossible to do _meta_end_dot_
