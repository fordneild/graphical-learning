  i almost fell over when i read this news gem from bill roggio and the long war journal mookie s people just told us _meta_number_ref_ days ago that he well mookster _meta_end_question_

 sistani just demanded it _meta_end_dot_

 either the whole basra thing is a stunt to garner popularity in the run up to the provincial elections or this uprising is essentially over and done with _meta_end_dot_

 what say you mookster _meta_end_question_

 ready to let iraq be a country yet _meta_end_question_

 more below the fold _meta_end_dot_

 interesting timing here by the way given petraeus and crocker were just in congress talking about the status of the surge and the progress we are beginning to see on a growing number of fronts _meta_end_dot_

 interesting as well that the president has just reinforced his commitment to see this thing through as he has promised from the beginning until iraq can secure herself and sustain herself _meta_end_dot_

 interesting comment from the mookie gang here as well again via roggio seems the democrats got this iraq issue wrong _meta_end_dot_

 again maliki and the iraq government really do seem to be getting the hang of this sovereign nation thing after all _meta_end_dot_
