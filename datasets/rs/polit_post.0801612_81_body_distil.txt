  i m on the road with fred thompson blogging from my iphone _meta_end_dot_

 right now we are in laurens sc _meta_end_dot_

 fred was asked about the break up of the reagan coalition _meta_end_dot_

 he said he disagrees with newt gingrich and mike huckabee _meta_end_dot_

 fred says that if the reagan coalition is dead the constituion is dead because the coalition was not about reagan it was about core principles common sense and knowing the role of the federal government _meta_end_dot_

 the issues have changed but the principles remain the same he said _meta_end_dot_
