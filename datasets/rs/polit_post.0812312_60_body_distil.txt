 how did the media describe the guy _meta_end_question_

 a baptist minister _meta_end_dot_

 who is the guy _meta_end_question_

 marty parrish joe biden s former office manager _meta_end_dot_

 he s also an obama supporter _meta_end_dot_

 naturally though the des moines register was too dumb to realize who the guy actually was _meta_end_dot_

 remember the left will stop at nothing this year _meta_end_dot_

 nothing _meta_end_dot_
