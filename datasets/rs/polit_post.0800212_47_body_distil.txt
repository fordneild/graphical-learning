  last january i wrote that i would give the surge til november later changed to year end and if there was no discernible progress i would opt for plan b which would be an orderly phased unilateral withdrawal of american forces from what i ve seen i think we should stick with plan a december was another month of low civilian casualties _meta_end_dot_

 and the three month moving average also illustrates this favorable trend _meta_end_dot_

 more below the fold _meta_end_dot_

 and military casualties are following that trend as well _meta_end_dot_

 the improved security situation has contributed to higher oil production also surging is confidence in the iraq economy last month in its report to congress the dept _meta_end_dot_

 of defense summarized the situation and following is the executive summary as far as summaries go it s a bit long but i think it paints a fair picture aside from progress on the national stage one of my other major concerns is the training of iraqi forces the dod report to congress has the detailed information but bill roggio has a summary and a helpful graph table _meta_end_dot_

 the most important column is c_meta_number_ref_ c_meta_number_ref_ which is quantifies the number of forces that are independent or in the lead the more iraqi troops at c_meta_number_ref_ c_meta_number_ref_ the fewer american troops needed and the more american troops able to go home or deploy to afghanistan _meta_end_dot_

 the national government is barely moving forward and there are still many dangerous areas but i think we re moving in the right direction and this isn t to say that things couldn t move backward in the coming months lots of things could go wrong do i think we re winning for me it s still too early to tell we ll need more time to see how iraqis respond to this progress _meta_end_dot_

 update a hat tip as usual to engram for the graphs the civilian casualty figures are based on data from the iraqi coalition casualty count which gets its data from independent media reports oh and i forgot to link to this interview with general petraeus the man who should ve been time s man of the year here s what petraeus sees ahead on the political situation _meta_end_dot_
