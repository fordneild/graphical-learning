  dear haw haw harry the moral authority of the united states was damaged when your number two man dick durbin went to the floor of the senate and called american soldiers nazi the moral authority of the united states was further damaged when you held a press conference and declared the war lost _meta_end_dot_

 the moral authority of the united states was further damaged when after bipartisan consensus developed that the surge was working you went to the floor of the senate to again declare our success a failure _meta_end_dot_

 the moral authority of this nation has been damaged repeatedly by you when you have chosen to aid and abet our terrorist enemies by taking to the senate floor to denounce the successes of our troops claim nefarious motives on the part of the administration and echo the talking points of our enemies _meta_end_dot_

 when in a time of war the majority leader of the united states senate uses his position to sabotage the efforts of our soldiers and vocally denounce the efforts as butchery and allow the majority whip to call our soldiers nazis you damage our nation s moral authority in addition to undermining the moral of our soldiers _meta_end_dot_

 sincerely
