  update the weekly standard has a good write up on this as well _meta_end_dot_

 pundits have been coming out of the woodwork today to claim that john mccain misspoke when he said that al qaeda has been receiving funding training and equipment from iran during the last year plus of the iraq war _meta_end_dot_

 the gotcha quote taken here sans link from thinkprogress is that he conflated sunni and shi a organizations which clearly represent opposing sides in the iraqi civil war sic here is the truth al qaeda has been receiving funding training and equipment from iran during the last year plus of the iraq war and denial of that fact belies a willful ignorance and a desire to remain ignorant of the truth at very least _meta_end_dot_

 people who look at the sectarian differences iran being shi a and aq being sunni and who write off any relationship between the two on those grounds are fooling themselves into inane ignorance _meta_end_dot_

 read on _meta_end_dot_

 life is complex as is the relationship between sunni and shi a and between different entities who all oppose the west and the u s _meta_end_dot_

 in particular _meta_end_dot_

 a common enemy can be the strongest adhesive as has been seen throughout the country where sunni and shia have banded together in anbar and elsewhere as tribal and citizens groups against aq and other terrorist outfits _meta_end_dot_

 i have seen sunni and shi a drive each other from their homes and slaughter each other simply because of the killers strange combination of sectarian hate and innate bloodlust _meta_end_dot_

 however i have also seen sunni and shi a working hand in hand to fight against the insurgency and i have seen them working hand in hand to fight america and to kill iraqi civilians _meta_end_dot_

 the gotcha game of foreign policy is a loser for all involved _meta_end_dot_

 how ecstatic for example will the leadership of iran be to hear that one of the two nominees to be president of the united states is being shouted down and pilloried for acknowledging the true fact that the persian state is and has been aiding a group that is one of western civilization s and iraq s bitterest most bloodthirsty and inhuman enemies the real transgression here is not slander and the real victim is not iran _meta_end_dot_

 rather the transgression is an abjectly pathetic detachment from the reality of our international and domestic security and strategic situation and the victim is america herself her security her standing and any belief on the part of the rest of the world especially our allies and our enemies that those running or vying to run the american government will put anything be it alliances security or the lives of our own soldiers and civilians ahead of the quest for ephemeral political gain _meta_end_dot_
