  the polling group has obama beating clinton in california georgia and missouri and a tie in new jersey _meta_end_dot_

 i still do not expect senator obama to win the democratic nomination he s an empty suit better he s a peacenik which means that i and more to the point the democratic establishment know that he s ultimately unelectable but he s definitely got an excellent chance of his candidacy surviving the next forty eight hours _meta_end_dot_

 this might go to the convention at that _meta_end_dot_

 heh _meta_end_dot_

 heh _meta_end_dot_

 heh _meta_end_dot_

 anyway for right now _meta_end_question_

 of those four georgia for obama new jersey and missouri for clinton after all but the latter one will be very close and california s going to go to the wire_meta_beep_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 moe but by all means keep believing otherwise those who do _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_beep_ref_presuming that zogby isn t the goat _meta_end_dot_

 they did better than i did in calling _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ s results but in three out of four of the states above their results are significantly rosier for obama than the other polls the fourth is georgia which is more in line with the others _meta_end_dot_

 somebody s going to look like an idiot on wednesday _meta_end_dot_
