  comes now the philosopher martha nussbaum to inform us that the fact that eliot spitzer had to resign as governor of the state of new york is a very bad thing and proof that we americans are insufferable prudes who still have a long way to go before we can be considered sophisticated and cosmopolitan _meta_end_dot_

 this is all so very tiresome _meta_end_dot_

 at the outset let us remind ourselves that as attorney general eliot spitzer prosecuted prostitution rings _meta_end_dot_

 if recent reports are to be believed and spitzer has been soliciting prostitution for as many as _meta_number_ref_ years spending nearly _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ in the process that means that spitzer was soliciting prostitutes even as he was busting the rings and looking like mr _meta_end_dot_

 clean in anticipation for his gubernatorial run in _meta_number_ref_ in the process _meta_end_dot_

 as governor spitzer signed into law legislation that increased the penalties on people soliciting prostitution _meta_end_dot_

 spitzer s hypocrisy is of course both nothing short of astonishing and utterly inescapable and yet nussbaum does not even address it _meta_end_dot_

 what nussbaum does engage in is the well worn practice of warning us that our behavior in circumstances such as these leaves ever so much to be desired because the europeans just don t approve darlings _meta_end_dot_

 this constant effort to make the europeans look like sexual sophisticates when compared to their supposedly dumber and less worldly american cousins is more than a little grating because contrary to popular belief and nussbaum s fevered imaginings the europeans are actually rather prudish about sex _meta_end_dot_

 remember the profumo affair _meta_end_question_

 john profumo didn t get to keep his job after his dalliances became a matter of public knowledge _meta_end_dot_

 like profumo spitzer compromised himself through his solicitation of prostitution and made himself vulnerable to blackmail _meta_end_dot_

 and as in the spitzer matter the public reacted with anger and disgust towards the news of profumo s activities _meta_end_dot_

 want more evidence that the europeans are significantly more prudish than nussbaum gives them credit for _meta_end_question_

 ask how well john major s government fared in the wake of the many sex scandals that befell it _meta_end_dot_

 i don t recall tony blair as having lost the election of _meta_number_ref_ to major and the repeated revelations of sex scandals affecting tory politicians in the run up to the _meta_number_ref_ election were one of the most important factors contributing to the fall of the major government _meta_end_dot_

 lest anyone think that this european prudishness is confined to britain consider the case of france _meta_end_dot_

 extramarital affairs amongst french politicians are only tolerated if they are kept quiet and out of the news _meta_end_dot_

 once they get into the news the french public can be as disapproving as any puritan colony out there _meta_end_dot_

 indeed the revelation of romantic affairs significantly more honorable than the solicitation of prostitution can land french politicians in hot water with a puritanical public _meta_end_dot_

 nicolas sarkozy divorced his previous wife met and fell in love with carla bruni and married her swiftly after their romance commenced _meta_end_dot_

 the french reacted to this high profile marriage a marriage not a visit to the red light district with much tut tutting and caused sarkozy s once high approval ratings to plummet precipitously _meta_end_dot_

 finally nussbaum seeks to change the debate from should eliot spitzer have been forced to resign and potentially face prosecution to should prostitution be illegal in the first place _meta_end_dot_

 the latter makes for an interesting public policy question and nussbaum puts forth arguments to explain why the selling of one s body for sex should not be such a big deal _meta_end_dot_

 one can of course debate these issues and heaven knows that we have ad nauseam but none of this changes the fact that there are laws against prostitution that eliot spitzer broke those laws that he had made a name for himself as attorney general and as governor in fighting prostitution both on the supply and on the demand sides and that thanks to his indiscretions he has robbed himself of the moral authority to run the state of new york and has exposed himself to legal prosecution in the process _meta_end_dot_

 this is yet another instance where evidently we have to remind spitzer defenders that no one is responsible for this sorry state of affairs save eliot spitzer _meta_end_dot_

 if you want to write an angry blog post devote it to denouncing the soon to be ex governor of the state of new york _meta_end_dot_

 he deserves it _meta_end_dot_

 and then some _meta_end_dot_
