  the white house for immediate release may _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ setting the record straight the following is a letter from counselor to the president ed gillespie to nbc news president steve capus steve capus _meta_number_ref_ rockefeller plaza mr _meta_end_dot_

 capus this e mail is to formally request that nbc nightly news and the today show air for their viewers president bush s actual answer to correspondent richard engel s question about iran policy and appeasement rather than the deceptively edited version of the president s answer that was aired last night on the nightly news and this morning on the today show _meta_end_dot_

 in the interview engel asked the president you said that negotiating with iran is pointless and then you went further _meta_end_dot_

 you said that it was appeasement _meta_end_dot_

 were you referring to senator barack obama the president responded you know my policies haven t changed but evidently the political calendar has _meta_end_dot_

 people need to read the speech _meta_end_dot_

 you didn t get it exactly right either _meta_end_dot_

 what i said was is that we need to take the words of people seriously _meta_end_dot_

 and when you know a leader of iran says that they want to destroy israel you ve got to take those words seriously _meta_end_dot_

 and if you don t take them seriously then it harkens back to a day when we didn t take other words seriously _meta_end_dot_

 it was fitting that i talked about not taking the words of adolf hitler seriously on the floor of the knesset _meta_end_dot_

 but i also talked about the need to defend israel the need to not negotiate with the likes of al qaeda hezbollah and hamas _meta_end_dot_

 and the need to make sure iran doesn t get a nuclear weapon read on _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 this answer makes clear _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 the president s remarks before the knesset were not different from past policy statements but are now being looked at through a political prism _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 corrects the inaccurate premise of engel s question by putting the appeasement line in the proper context of taking the words of leaders seriously not negotiating with iran _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 restates the u s s long standing policy positions against negotiating with al qaeda hezbollah and hamas and not allowing iran to obtain a nuclear weapon _meta_end_dot_

 engel s immediate follow up question was repeatedly you ve talked about iran and that you don t want to see iran develop a nuclear weapon _meta_end_dot_

 how far away do you think iran is from developing a nuclear capability the president replied you know richard i don t want to speculate and there s a lot of speculation _meta_end_dot_

 but one thing is for certain we need to prevent them from learning how to enrich uranium _meta_end_dot_

 and i have made it clear to the iranians that there is a seat at the table for them if they would verifiably suspend their enrichment _meta_end_dot_

 and if not we ll continue to rally the world to isolate them this response reiterates another long standing policy which is that if iran verifiably suspends its uranium enrichment program the u s _meta_end_dot_

 government would engage in talks with the iranian government _meta_end_dot_

 nbc s selective editing of the president s response is clearly intended to give viewers the impression that he agreed with engel s characterization of his remarks when he explicitly challenged it _meta_end_dot_

 furthermore it omitted the references to al qaeda hezbollah and hamas and ignored the clarifying point in the president s follow up response that u s _meta_end_dot_

 policy is to require iran to suspend its nuclear enrichment program before coming to the table not that negotiating with iran is pointless and amounts to appeasement this deceitful editing to further a media manufactured storyline is utterly misleading and irresponsible and i hereby request in the interest of fairness and accuracy that the network air the president s responses to both initial questions in full on the two programs that used the excerpts _meta_end_dot_

 as long as i am making this formal request please allow me to take this opportunity to ask if your network has reconsidered its position that iraq is in the midst of a civil war especially in light of the fact that the unity government in baghdad recently rooted out illegal extremist groups in basra and reclaimed the port there for the people of iraq among other significant signs of progress _meta_end_dot_

 on november _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ nbc news made a decision to no longer just cover the news in iraq but to make an analytical and editorial judgment that iraq was in a civil war _meta_end_dot_

 as you know both the united states government and the government of iraq disputed your account at that time _meta_end_dot_

 as matt lauer said that morning on the today show we should mention we didn t just wake up on a monday morning and say let s call this a civil war this took careful deliberation i noticed that around september of _meta_number_ref_ your network quietly stopped referring to conditions in iraq as a civil war is it still nbc news s carefully deliberated opinion that iraq is in the midst of a civil war _meta_end_question_

 if not will the network publicly declare that the civil war has ended or that it was wrong to declare it in the first place _meta_end_question_

 lastly when the commerce department on april _meta_number_ref_ released the gdp numbers for the first quarter of _meta_number_ref_ brian williams reported it this way if you go by the government number the figure that came out today stops just short of the official declaration of a recession the gdp estimate was a positive _meta_number_ref_ _meta_percent_ref_ for the first quarter _meta_end_dot_

 slow growth but growth nonetheless _meta_end_dot_

 this followed a slow but growing fourth quarter in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 consequently even if the first quarter gdp estimate had been negative it still would not have signaled a recession neither by the unofficial rule of thumb of two consecutive quarters of negative growth nor the more robust definition by the national bureau of economic research the group that officially marks the beginnings and ends of business cycles _meta_end_dot_

 furthermore never in our nation s history have we characterized economic conditions as a recession with unemployment so low in fact when this rate of unemployment was eventually reached in the _meta_number_ref_s it was hailed as the sign of a strong economy _meta_end_dot_

 this rate of unemployment is lower than the average of the past three decades _meta_end_dot_

 are there numbers besides the government number to go by _meta_end_question_

 is there reason to believe the government number is suspect _meta_end_question_

 how does the release of positive economic growth for two consecutive quarters albeit limited stop just short of the official declaration of a recession _meta_end_question_

 mr _meta_end_dot_

 capus i m sure you don t want people to conclude that there is really no distinction between the news as reported on nbc and the opinion as reported on msnbc despite the increasing blurring of those lines _meta_end_dot_

 i welcome your response to this letter and hope it is one that reassures your broadcast network s viewers that blatantly partisan talk show hosts like christopher matthews and keith olbermann at msnbc don t hold editorial sway over the nbc network news division _meta_end_dot_

 sincerely ed gillespie counselor to the president this letter was posted at talkingpointsmemo com so credit where credit is due _meta_end_dot_

 even though they posted it for the wrong reason _meta_end_dot_

 celebrating patriots and exposing traitors at _meta_url_ref_ with a new video on the way george bush s it s a wonderful country yes a take off on the movie coming soon _meta_end_exclamation_

 it doesn t spill the beans but it does tell a story you don t know yet _meta_end_dot_
