  the reconstruction effort in iraq continues to be a difficult task one that entails a great many challenges _meta_end_dot_

 part of the frustration in examining the reaction to those challenges in this country is seeing just how frightened commentators get by any adverse development whatsoever _meta_end_dot_

 one recent adverse development was the decision by muqtada al sadr to allow his followers to revolt in basra _meta_end_dot_

 instantly this was proclaimed as proof that the surge and the implementation of the american counterinsurgency effort had failed _meta_end_dot_

 well maybe not it is probably more accurate to state that there will continue to be tough slogging ahead in iraq _meta_end_dot_

 but thanks to the surge and the counterinsurgency effort the reconstruction effort is proceeding more successfully than it was in the past _meta_end_dot_

 and just as commentators gnashed their teeth in despair over the brief sadrist uprising one would now expect them to rejoice over the fact that the uprising seems to have come to an end and to make as big a deal about that end as they did of the beginning _meta_end_dot_
