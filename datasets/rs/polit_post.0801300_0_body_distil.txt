 the republicans are behind _meta_end_dot_

 nominating rudy romney or huck starts the rs behind _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ points _meta_end_dot_

 nominating mccain starts the rs off down a point or two _meta_end_dot_

 the real story here as with other recent national polls is the rudy plunge _meta_end_dot_

 once upon a time rudy s electability was his strong point _meta_end_dot_

 rudy s pitch was yeah i m pro choice but i m with you on other things and i can totally crush hillary seeing rudy s approval drop from _meta_number_ref_ to _meta_number_ref_ and his head to head numbers against hillary drop from a competitive _meta_number_ref_ to _meta_number_ref_ must be distressing to the rudy camp _meta_end_dot_

 his best hope is that no one notices the shift and continues to believe he is the most electable despite his falling popularity _meta_end_dot_

 the one other major point here is that the republican brand is still in the tank _meta_end_dot_

 when people point to congressional disapproval for hope they have to remember that the number is so low because many ds think the congress should have withdrawn the troops by now _meta_end_dot_

 congressional rs still have lower ratings than congressional ds _meta_end_dot_

 and hillary or obama will be arguing that having a d president will make it possible to do what they wanted to do the last _meta_number_ref_ years _meta_end_dot_

 if they get the same _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ result as in _meta_number_ref_ ds will be at their strongest point since just after watergate _meta_end_dot_

 it isn t popular in the right o sphere to say it _meta_end_dot_

 but odds are we will have a d president _meta_number_ref_ d senators and a _meta_number_ref_ seat margin in the house for the ds _meta_end_dot_

 rs are out of touch with independent voters right now and losing _meta_number_ref_ _meta_percent_ref_ of them _meta_end_dot_

 that s what happened in _meta_number_ref_ and it is very possible it will happen in _meta_number_ref_ unless something changes _meta_end_dot_
