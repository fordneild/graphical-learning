  good lord _meta_end_dot_

 i actually did not see the whole debate but then made sure to diligently read the transcript and avoid being led to drink or commit suicide _meta_end_dot_

 having gone back now and seen the clips it confirms my impression of the debate barack jesus obama spoke in beatitudes and hillary clinton talked in substance _meta_end_dot_

 some people want their heart strings pulled and some people want substance _meta_end_dot_

 the former will probably go with obama and the latter with hillary _meta_end_dot_

 about the only thing i can say is that both of them loved to bash bush and the rich _meta_end_dot_

 it s a pity they spoke so highly of workers and the american people while bashing the rich a k a job providers _meta_end_dot_

 hillary throughout the debate tried to throw some punches but went soft at the end _meta_end_dot_

 see for example this one by the way john edwards name came up twice tonight _meta_end_dot_

 both times by hillary clinton singing his praises _meta_end_dot_

 you think she s wooing him for a last minute endorsement _meta_end_question_

 it d probably help her in both texas and ohio more so than it would help obama were he to get the edwards nod _meta_end_dot_

 and it would really make edwards the queen maker _meta_end_dot_
