 summer jobs green jobs whatever the bloody hell that will actually do to stimulate the economy higher medicaid spending heating oil subsidies and infrastructure and broadband bridges and energy technology _meta_end_dot_

 saddest of all is the idea that all of these things could have been addressed throughout last year were the democrats more interested in governing as a majority rather than bloviating and grandstanding for their kook fringes looking for votes and campaign dollars _meta_end_dot_

 i m no economist either but i m fairly certain that this is the worst kind of election season political pandering we ve seen in a very long time and will do nothing to stimulate the economy taze it into paralysis perhaps but stimulate ugh it s for the chilren_meta_beep_ref_ did i mention that my head is exploding _meta_end_question_
