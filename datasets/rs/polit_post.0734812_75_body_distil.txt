  after listening to ceaseless attacks directly from the mouth of mitt romney _meta_number_ref_ republican presidential hopeful mike huckabee has brought on veteran gop op ed rollins to run his campaign _meta_end_dot_

 well rollins did president reagan s reelection campaign in _meta_number_ref_ but rollins also ran the campaign of ross perot in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 this was in order for huckabee as his ragtag band of supporters was having an impossible time of responding to the incoming attacks _meta_end_dot_

 it doesn t change huckabee s ideology and campaign skill though turning him into neither a ronald reagan nor a ross perot _meta_end_dot_
