  let me get this straight _meta_end_dot_

 at last night s democratic debate one candidate hillary clinton attacks the other barack obama with something to the effect of you announced your candidacy for public office at the house of two known and unrepentant terrorists _meta_end_dot_

 the candidate responds with but your husband pardoned other unrepentant and known terrorists why don t they distance themselves from the weather underground rather than apologize for them _meta_end_question_

 these terrorists are to quote a release from the obama campaign respectable fixtures in mainstream liberal chicago having lived in the hyde park of barack obama and bill ayers for _meta_number_ref_ years i understand the rationale of the hyperbole excuse me but wtf _meta_end_question_

 why is obama defending this _meta_end_question_

 read on _meta_end_dot_

 so what does this guy who is mainstream liberal chicago think _meta_end_question_

 well he was kind enough to tell us about _meta_number_ref_ days ago is this really the liberal mainstream of chicago or anywhere else in america _meta_end_question_

 why is barack defending these people _meta_end_question_

 i repeat wtf _meta_end_question_

 some people on the left will correctly point out that it is odd to relitigate the _meta_number_ref_s _meta_end_dot_

 but why can t these guys just distance themselves rather than embrace these unrepentant terrorists _meta_end_question_

 and the democrats wonder why people care about these symbolic issues _meta_end_question_

 for more way bizarro world stuff i refer you to david brody s post over at the christian broadcasting network _meta_end_dot_

 weirdo quotes from the videos like white youth must choose sides now _meta_end_dot_

 we must either fight on the side of the oppressed or be on the side of the oppressor
