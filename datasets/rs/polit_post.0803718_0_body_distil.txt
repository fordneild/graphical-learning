  after highlighting congressman blunt s earmarks last week and comparing them to john boehner s boehner had none congressman blunt s office kindly called me to say congressman blunt wanted to keep pursuing the matter and working to reach a solution _meta_end_dot_

 the congressman s office said we were at the floor on this issue and congressman blunt would keep working to make sure something was done to stop earmarks proliferation _meta_end_dot_

 i think it is safe now to say that congressman blunt is full of it on this issue _meta_end_dot_

 i m very very disappointed _meta_end_dot_

 compare congressman blunt to his fellow republican leaders _meta_end_dot_

 i will remember this failure of leadership _meta_end_dot_
