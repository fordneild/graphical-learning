  i don t mean this to be negative of the romney camp but i really think they need to do something about this _meta_end_dot_

 i think there are two overwhelming factors that have hurt the romney campaign thus far _meta_number_ref_ there is a sense of arrogance that voters react negatively to and _meta_number_ref_ there is this perception that mitt romney can t be trusted _meta_end_dot_

 i m not going to debate whether those are concerns people have but i m telling you that a lot of people have them and they are reflected in the exit polls _meta_end_dot_

 the media smells blood in the water _meta_end_dot_

 they consider themselves the real experts on vote counting etc _meta_end_dot_

 they ve waited eight years for this race _meta_end_dot_

 and they are going to really really make a stink about romney ignoring iowa s delegates _meta_end_dot_

 i guarantee you it is going to happen _meta_end_dot_

 they will use it as just another example of romney playing fast and loose with convenient facts _meta_end_dot_

 the romney campaign might want to just suck it up and admit they lost iowa to huckabee _meta_end_dot_

 updated i stand mostly corrected _meta_end_dot_

 in prior years all the major news networks attributed iowa delegates at the time of winning _meta_end_dot_

 but as several readers have pointed out in the comments the media is not doing that this year with the sole exception of abc _meta_end_dot_

 so nevermind _meta_end_dot_
