  when i pulled into the hooksett polling place around _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ am i came into a traffic jam _meta_end_dot_

 it was _meta_number_ref_ minutes before i could get to a parking spot _meta_end_dot_

 simply put turnout was huge _meta_end_dot_

 the union leader reports massive turnout _meta_end_dot_

 the secretary of state has predicted a _meta_number_ref_k turnout and three or four campaigns are using this for their turnout model _meta_end_dot_

 last night talking to some state party officials they pointed out that _meta_number_ref_k people voted in the high turnout _meta_number_ref_ general election _meta_end_dot_

 i am watching msnbc right now and chuck todd semi predicted even higher _meta_end_dot_

 if as the union leader reported over _meta_percent_ref_ of the voters are new registrants it could be even higher _meta_end_dot_

 at the polling places that i have seen obama mccain and clinton have volunteers at polling places _meta_end_dot_

 no romney or rudy people _meta_end_dot_

 although one place had a parked truck with a big romney sign on it chatting with the obama and clinton people on the ground they made it clear that they were rooting for romney because they felt like they could beat him _meta_end_dot_

 watching the results tonight will be interesting _meta_end_dot_
