  i have written already on the voter id scotus decision _meta_end_dot_

 when the crazy left objects to voter id they cry suppression _meta_end_dot_

 but abigail thornstrom the vice chair of the us commission on civil rights points to perhaps the simplest sentence in the decision there is no question about the legitimacy or importance of the state s interest in counting only the votes of eligible voters the problem for the far left is that we are on to their strategy _meta_end_dot_

 every year acorn tries to register zillions of non existent voters _meta_end_dot_

 watch this to see how they do it in washington state if they don t exist _meta_end_dot_
