 arnold schwarzenegger s stark honesty about the disastrous condition of california s finances in his state of the state address tuesday _meta_end_dot_

 the budget deficit currently being run by the state is _meta_dollor_ref_ billion and with the recent revelation that another _meta_dollor_ref_ billion will have to be found over the next _meta_number_ref_ years to cover guaranteed health benefits for retirees this number is only poised to increase for the foreseeable future _meta_end_dot_

 the governator is expected to declare the state to be in a state of fiscal emergency later this week and has already proposed dealing with the economic disaster by releasing tens of thousands of prisoners early _meta_end_dot_

 in his state of the state address schwarzenegger commendably spoke of responsibly reacting to the budget crisis by committing to permanently rein in spending and not to raise taxes unfortunately his continued pursuit of the poorly titled health care security and cost reduction act gives the lie to those promises _meta_end_dot_

 in pushing this legislative attempt to give government more control over the state s health care apparatus schwarzenegger is still advocating billions of dollars in tax increases _meta_end_dot_

 these tax increases on hospitals business payrolls and tobacco will impose even greater financial hardship on working californians and will not result in appreciable improvement in the health care and health insurance markets _meta_end_dot_

 schwarzenegger should follow his own promises not to raise taxes and should seek courses of action that can effectively combat california s fiscal and health care crises _meta_end_dot_

 fighting wasteful government spending and opening up the health care market to more competition and less regulation would be a good start _meta_end_dot_
