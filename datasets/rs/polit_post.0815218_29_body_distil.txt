  there s more to the mcclellan story than what our purveyors of truth and fairness in the main scream media have told you his mama made him do it _meta_end_dot_

 hmm _meta_end_dot_

 for the record i have already suggested that folks like mcclellan who suck at their jobs might yet find ways to improve their sorry lives by writing books and using them as shivs in the backs of those who stood by them while they sucked at their jobs _meta_end_dot_

 but even monica lewinsky knew when to keep her mouth shut and when to open it do with that what you will _meta_end_dot_

 what mcclellan tells us in his book while juicy and delicious and delectable for those who spend every waking moment looking for reasons to hate president bush or be vindicated for already hating him really doesn t concern me very much _meta_end_dot_

 the bigger issue with this latest rumor mill style of so called tell all trash from an inferior and disgruntled employee is in understanding why he did this when he did it _meta_end_dot_

 but before we go below the fold for more details let s segue with a love letter from bob dole _meta_end_dot_

 just to set the tone funny you should mention that bob given that last may be exactly what ol scotty boy has in mind _meta_end_dot_

 more below the pass the popcorn fold _meta_end_dot_

 i know i know bush lied people died got it _meta_end_dot_

 it s about the oil dummy check _meta_end_dot_

 we were misled into an unjust war uh huh _meta_end_dot_

 what never ceases to amaze me as the screamers on the left rail unabated about the evil ness of george bush is how much credit they give to a man they simultaneously insist is the dumbest dolt of a president we have ever elected into office _meta_end_dot_

 he s done quite well for himself taking over the world while being about as sharp upstairs as ol forrest gump _meta_end_dot_

 of course this all makes for great political theater but it doesn t serve our collective best interests regarding taxes entitlements national security and sovereignty or the plight of the homeless but who really cares about that boring stuff anyway _meta_end_question_

 someone is standing up again and speaking truthyness to power you see _meta_end_dot_

 partially stealing from gingrich here i would offer that most of us care more about american idol than this whole mcclellan flap save for those who stand to gain something from keeping this hot in the news _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ related articles when i pulled the search if you re as cynical as me you ll recognize this is all about laying groundwork _meta_end_dot_

 perry is going to leave the governor s mansion sooner or later and while kay bailey hutchison may or may not run to replace him carol keeton strayhorn mcclellan rylander strayhorn whatever just may be aiming to claim that real estate for herself _meta_end_dot_

 she has never been loyal to a party if it got in the way of her own ambitions why should her progeny be any different _meta_end_question_

 of course as paul burka points out in the washington times piece ol scotty boy won t be getting too many votes in the near future down here in texas but that doesn t mean his mama wouldn t benefit were she to turn left again from the noise and the ruffled feathers of dazed and confused republicans here in texas _meta_end_dot_

 note to scott we texans have very long memories man you might want to take on one of your mother s other last names she s got a couple to spare in a piece at the wapo mcclellan tells us his book evolved and insists that he did not set out to write a memoir that was sharply critical of the white house funny scott it became a scathing critique of the bush presidency all the same _meta_end_dot_

 sorta like how your mama evolved from being a republican running for governor until she knew she was going to lose and became an independent who lost just as badly _meta_end_dot_

 and a lot of why she lost was because of her incessant bitching about her competition as opposed to offering sound ideas for improving texas _meta_end_dot_

 scott mcclellan could have stayed on plan and written this book to help improve washington _meta_end_dot_

 unfortunately like with his mama one tough grandma it evolved into trashing everyone around him just to make himself feel a little bit better about his own shortcomings _meta_end_dot_

 again from the washtimes the apple sure didn t fall far from that tree now did it _meta_end_question_
