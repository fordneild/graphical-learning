  think about this for a minute _meta_end_dot_

 the media loves to say what a great politician bill clinton is _meta_end_dot_

 during bill clinton s tenure in the white house the republicans took back congress we saw a massive conversion to the gop at the state and local level clinton s major policy initiatives were derails or pushed to the right see e g _meta_end_dot_

 welfare reform he got impeached and he went through defense secretaries oral experts and nominees for other offices like most people go through underwear _meta_end_dot_

 bill clinton is not a great politician _meta_end_dot_

 bill clinton is a great self promoter _meta_end_dot_

 the important ancillary business of being a politician has never been a good fit for clinton because it involved things other than himself see e g _meta_end_dot_

 his marriage _meta_end_dot_

 now he wants back in the white house _meta_end_dot_

 his wife does too _meta_end_dot_

 though she s yesterday s trash to him she is a clinton groupie _meta_end_dot_

 and she has learned from him _meta_end_dot_

 together they have developed a take no prisoners self promotional love fest attitude _meta_end_dot_

 and this is key they are willing to say and do anything to get back to the white house including destroy the democratic party _meta_end_dot_

 and that my friends is why i endorse hillary _meta_end_dot_

 look at what they are doing right now _meta_end_dot_

 in the name of getting hillary into the white house they are willing to race bait a democratic primary _meta_end_dot_

 is that not cool as hell to watch _meta_end_question_

 seriously _meta_end_question_

 clinton is engaging in the blackification of barack obama comparing him to jesse jackson no doubt soon to al sharpton in order to scare jewish voters and latino voters not to mention white voters _meta_end_dot_

 let s also not forget that the clintons are wiling to pit union forces against each other so that hillary can stay on top _meta_end_dot_

 the two great forces of the democratic coalition are engaged in an intra party blood bath unions vs _meta_end_dot_

 unions and races vs _meta_end_dot_

 races _meta_end_dot_

 it is a beautiful thing to watch _meta_end_dot_

 so i endorse hillary clinton s candidacy for the white house _meta_end_dot_

 and if as i suspect none of the republican candidates is actually worthy enough to win this year we ll all need to make sure our tax returns are in order but doggone watching the clintons destroy the country over the next four years will if nothing else totally gloss over the fecklessly inept craptitude of the current congressional republican leaders _meta_end_dot_

 bring on the next republican revolution even if lamar _meta_end_exclamation_

 take no prisoners only dinner companions alexander is one of its leaders _meta_end_dot_

 update hey people _meta_end_exclamation_

 does this post say i m voting for mrs _meta_end_dot_

 bill clinton _meta_end_question_

 no _meta_end_dot_

 but i m a free market guy _meta_end_dot_

 i d like to hedge my bets _meta_end_dot_

 we re more viable against her and she potentially destroys the democratic party from within _meta_end_dot_

 so get on board now _meta_end_exclamation_

 start talking up obama like the right really likes him _meta_end_dot_

 make the lefties turn and run en masse toward hillary _meta_end_dot_
