  whoops _meta_end_exclamation_

 sorry h t protein wisdom what does it take for mother jones to get a favorable mention on redstate anyway _meta_end_question_

 why writing something useful of course _meta_end_dot_

 do you know i hadn t even heard of either citizens united or hillary the movie before the magazine brought up either _meta_end_question_

 go figure _meta_end_dot_

 read on _meta_end_dot_

 speaking as a practical matter i understand that while mother jones and by extension most of the rest of the progressive movement must be getting increasingly frantic over the indications that neither of their anti clintons are going anywhere endorsing right wing hit pieces isn t the way to go about winning the election _meta_end_dot_

 what _meta_end_question_

 oh _meta_end_dot_

 well duh of course hillary the movie is a right wing hit piece _meta_end_dot_

 break that down it s certainly coming from my side of the aisle and well to my right as well the ann coulter presence is as we say diagnostic _meta_end_dot_

 and cu ain t accusing the clintons of killing people s cats and conducting prison interviews with former staff because they want to be on the couple s next christmas card list _meta_end_dot_

 all conceded and shoot these guys probably would consider me to be some sort of squishy moderate rino who s not to be trusted at all at all _meta_end_dot_

 which makes it fascinating that mother jones is so terrified of the inevitable nomination of hillary clinton and thanks to barack obama s careful blandness and john edwards willful refusal to accept reality it is inevitable that it is willing to try to use this group to stop her _meta_end_dot_

 yes yes i understand the concept of any weapon at hand as well as the next gamer but still _meta_end_dot_

 this favorable review and validation of hillary the movie will not go away after the convention_meta_beep_ref_ and if mother jones doesn t expect the producers of it to use their own recommendation against them well _meta_end_dot_

 i understand i really do it s scary watching the avalanche come down _meta_end_dot_

 but they would have been better off trying to build up the walls erected to hold it off instead of just trying to shoot at the oncoming snow and ice _meta_end_dot_

 and what was this with giving props to senate majo _meta_end_dot_

 excuse me senate minority leader mitch mcconnell _meta_end_question_

 were they not paying attention to the last year _meta_end_question_

 the man s sole hobbies are apparently passing gop legislation blocking democratic legislation and making harry reid cry like a little girl _meta_end_dot_

 moe lane pack sunscreen and lots of spare water ye netrootian protesters _meta_end_dot_

 and watch out for altitude sickness _meta_end_dot_
