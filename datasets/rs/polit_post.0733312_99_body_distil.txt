  before congress left town to enjoy some turkey and time with the family congressman zach wamp congressman frank wolf and i introduced a resolution calling for a moratorium on earmarks till a joint select committee makes a full study _meta_end_dot_

 the bill currently has _meta_number_ref_ cosponsors _meta_end_dot_

 our resolution establishes a joint select committee on earmark reform that will be composed of _meta_number_ref_ members evenly split between the house and senate majority and minority parties _meta_end_dot_

 this jsc will make a full study of earmarks both congressional and executive branch _meta_end_dot_

 the study will not only cover earmarking in appropriation bills but also authorizing tax and tariff measures _meta_end_dot_

 after all the famous bridge to nowhere was part of an authorizing bill not appropriations _meta_end_dot_

 what will this study cover _meta_end_question_

 the intent is for it to be as comprehensive as possible _meta_end_dot_

 while not exhaustive this includes the three of us have worked hard to come up with an earmark reform proposal that is acceptable to all members _meta_end_dot_

 i think we ve come up with a good bill that has the support of appropriators budget hawks and republican moderates _meta_end_dot_

 this is the first earmark reform bill that can claim such a coalition _meta_end_dot_

 i am confident that once this resolution gets to the house floor we can work in a bipartisan manner to get it passed _meta_end_dot_
