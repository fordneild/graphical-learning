  as the democrats continue to grapple with their failed leadership in congress and as the prez wannabes begin to blame the house and senate for troubles in their own polling data we can find some modicum of comfort in the knowledge that they will self destruct with or without any help from the right _meta_end_dot_

 consider this little nugget that is high sterical we already know they are listening to us bill sheesh the problem with you guys is that you don t hear what we re saying _meta_end_dot_

 my goodness man has the democrat party really become a support group of the deaf dumb and blind _meta_end_question_

 wait i forgot they have _meta_end_dot_

 of course richardson couldn t leave it at that wow _meta_end_dot_

 perhaps as bill and the boys err boys and girls listen to america through the polls that suggest _meta_percent_ref_ of americans are dissatisfied with iraq they might re think what that number means _meta_end_dot_

 while democrats might think the best way to handle a difficult situation is to run from it most americans want to fix problems not pretend they don t exist _meta_end_dot_

 or is that only a republican trait _meta_end_question_

 more below the fold _meta_end_dot_

 not wanting to be outdone biden came up with the standard it s the eeevil republicans that are to blame for our inability to run a country meme obviously he s trying to suggest the democrats only hope is to purely outnumber republicans again missing the opportunity to explain what things in their agenda are superior to those from republicans _meta_end_dot_

 this last of course because there really isn t anything in their agenda _meta_end_dot_

 why let facts and reality get in the way of the greed for power for power s sake alone _meta_end_question_

 that is the democrat agenda after all and why not _meta_end_question_

 they have much invested in taking over the country _meta_end_dot_

 consider edwards genius he s got some seriously brass stones to continue with that tripe given his own powerful well connected wealth _meta_end_dot_

 again we mustn t let facts get in the way this is a group hug here not a reality show _meta_end_dot_

 i will give edwards credit for one thing there really are two americas _meta_end_dot_

 of course the one he lives in compares not at all with the one most of the rest of us live in _meta_end_dot_

 this little gem says a lot did i miss the memo that suggested the new patriotism the liberal patriotism _meta_end_dot_

 was defined as giving all my hard earned money to people that did nothing to earn it of their own accord _meta_end_question_

 where is that passage in the dictionary that says real patriotism requires of us all to sacrifice our assets and our earnings so the bottom of the food chain won t feel like the bottom of the food chain _meta_end_question_

 i think i ll stick with the eeevil republicans thank you very much _meta_end_dot_
