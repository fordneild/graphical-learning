  the next president of the united states will face some of the most monumental foreign policy challenges in our nation s history _meta_end_dot_

 because of this i believe foreign policy experience matters _meta_end_dot_

 for governor romney to say otherwise is simply naive because experience does matter i encourage you to support john mccain for president _meta_end_dot_

 our national security challenges include combating radical islamic extremism commanding us forces in iraq and afghanistan supporting allies surrounded by hostile regimes and dealing with iran s nuclear ambitions a volatile pakistan putinism in russia a rising china with a growing military capability and well you get my point _meta_end_dot_

 our nation has been blessed to have the right leader at the most crucial times _meta_end_dot_

 john mccain is the right leader for our time _meta_end_dot_

 please read on _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 for the last decade as a member of the house and now as u s _meta_end_dot_

 senator from south carolina i have had the honor and privilege of working with senator mccain _meta_end_dot_

 we have literally traveled the world together with our colleagues going from one hotspot to the next _meta_end_dot_

 these trips are affectionately known as march or die tours because of the schedule that john sets _meta_end_dot_

 as a result i ve seen first hand how world leaders receive john with both respect and admiration _meta_end_dot_

 john mccain has been involved in every significant national security issue of the last _meta_number_ref_ years _meta_end_dot_

 he stood strong in the reagan revolution when freedom prevailed over communist tyranny _meta_end_dot_

 this vast experience has equipped him uniquely among this year s presidential candidates with the knowledge and experience necessary to lead our country through treacherous times _meta_end_dot_

 john mccain knows the major policy makers throughout the world and most importantly they know him _meta_end_dot_

 this past july on our return from a tour of iraq we stopped to visit the new french president nicolas sarkozy who possesses a refreshing attitude toward our nation and the world _meta_end_dot_

 as a candidate sarkozy visited john in washington to receive his counsel on a variety of issues facing our two nations _meta_end_dot_

 when we met in july it was evident that sarkozy very much liked and admired john and that these two talented men could form a strong alliance between our nations _meta_end_dot_

 because of john s concern about the direction russia has taken under putin he constantly visits and talks with the new young leaders emerging from former soviet satellite states _meta_end_dot_

 whether from the ukraine georgia central europe or the balkan states the leaders of these nations know that john mccain is freedom s friend and ally _meta_end_dot_

 for over twenty years john mccain has led the american congressional delegation to the international security conference held in munich germany _meta_end_dot_

 the attendees include foreign ministers defense ministers and heads of states from all of the major powers throughout the globe _meta_end_dot_

 john s keynote address where he discusses his vision of a secure and democratic world is one of the most widely attended and discussed events _meta_end_dot_

 whether listening to john mccain discuss the hopes and dreams of the palestinian people with prime minister abbas or reassuring our israeli allies of his staunch and unwavering support i find in john a man uniquely qualified to meet the challenges of our times _meta_end_dot_

 the experience he possesses best explains why henry kissinger george shultz lawrence eagleburger and al haig four prominent former secretaries of state have endorsed john mccain for president _meta_end_dot_

 they know john mccain and have confidence that he is the right man to lead our nation in these difficult times _meta_end_dot_

 we need a strong leader _meta_end_dot_

 someone is not afraid to stand up to those who would do us harm and work hand in hand with allies who share our love of freedom and liberty _meta_end_dot_

 in that regard it is hard to imagine a more prepared candidate for the job of commander in chief than john mccain _meta_end_dot_

 during our numerous visits to iraq and afghanistan i continue to be amazed at how our own troops relate to him _meta_end_dot_

 whether meeting with senior military leaders sergeants or privates john mccain understands the challenges facing our military men and women and speaks their language _meta_end_dot_

 nowhere is this more evident than john mccain s tough principled and enlightened leadership on the issue of iraq _meta_end_dot_

 for almost four years our nation pursued a failed strategy where progress and ultimate victory slipped from our grasp _meta_end_dot_

 before anyone else john understood this dynamic and the fact we did not have enough troops on the ground to combat a growing insurgency _meta_end_dot_

 he was a lonely voice for change at odds with the bush administration and under fire from some members of our own party _meta_end_dot_

 in spite of the polls and opposition john called for a surge in troops and a real counterinsurgency strategy _meta_end_dot_

 we now know what democratic presidential candidate john edwards sarcastically called the mccain surge has worked _meta_end_dot_

 they results are obvious and dramatic in terms of improving the security situation in iraq _meta_end_dot_

 we have a long and difficult struggle ahead but we are finally on the right course a change in strategy and direction charted by john mccain _meta_end_dot_

 when he says he would rather lose an election than lose a war i believe him _meta_end_dot_

 he s already proven it _meta_end_dot_

 i believe we need a commander in chief who knows his core values and will not waver in the face of the prevailing political winds _meta_end_dot_

 voters should choose a candidate who is prepared by a lifetime of experience to lead this nation from day one when he takes the oath of office _meta_end_dot_

 for the sake of our country you can make sure that our nation continues to be blessed with the right leadership for our time by ensuring that john mccain wins the new hampshire primary _meta_end_dot_
