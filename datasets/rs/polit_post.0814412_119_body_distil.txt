  you ve probably read soren s first piece starring jim johnson about the lobbyists and bundlers that are lurking around senator barack obama s campaign _meta_end_dot_

 some of you might have even been bitterly going so what _meta_end_question_

 the obama knows what he s doing he might let people like jim johnson give him money but the obama certainly doesn t trust them yeah _meta_end_dot_

 about that but hey _meta_end_exclamation_

 jim did such a great job for mondale kerry and fannie mae why not let him work his peculiar magic for the obama campaign _meta_end_question_

 i mean clearly if johnson s good enough for obama he should be more than good enough for all the little people that are faithfully supporting the senator _meta_end_dot_

 even if johnson was involved in shenanigans that are now making us contemplate doing a _meta_dollor_ref_ billion dollar bailout of the home mortgage industry _meta_end_dot_

 great choice there barry _meta_end_dot_

 who s going to be your pick for helping the dnc with their fund raising by the way _meta_end_question_

 i hear jeffrey skilling s not doing anything these days of course he can t really travel _meta_end_dot_

 moe lane quick ps reread obama s supposed denial _meta_end_dot_

 note that it does not say jim johnson will not be the person to lead my vp selection process it merely says that obama s not paying him _meta_end_dot_

 it is in fact a rather ornate weasel of a statement _meta_end_dot_

 but i suppose that people will cling to what they cling to _meta_end_dot_
