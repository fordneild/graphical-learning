  let s all focus again on the comment senator obama made concerning people in small towns of course we all know that cnn is in the tank for obama and we know that jack cafferty is a moron especially when it comes to his outlandishly foolish statements concerning trade policy _meta_end_dot_

 but never mind that for a moment _meta_end_dot_

 note instead the comments made around the _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ mark _meta_end_dot_

 evidently cafferty and cnn have chosen to defend obama by arguing that if economic conditions continue the way they are going the small town hicks of america could eventually become something akin to al qaeda terrorists _meta_end_dot_

 and the obama campaign sent this out in order to defend obama s comments _meta_end_dot_

 just let that sink in _meta_end_dot_
