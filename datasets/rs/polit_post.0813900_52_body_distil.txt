  we should be appalled by now that the contretemps involving president bush and senators obama and mccain has lasted as long as it has _meta_end_dot_

 by now cooler heads should have prevailed and forcefully responded to senator obama that a plain reading of the language of president bush s speech before the knesset makes clear that senator obama was in no way implicated in the president s comments concerning the appeasement of dictators and terrorists _meta_end_dot_

 indeed white house officials have said on background that if anything the comments were directed at jimmy carter in the aftermath of his recent meeting with hamas and the only politician who was directly criticized in the oft repeated quote from the president s speech was republican senator william borah who was apparently never disabused from the notion that if only he could have met with hitler borah s powers of eloquence alone would have been sufficient to stop world war ii from ever having broken out _meta_end_dot_

 but of course we are still in the midst of the contretemps and still dealing with the blasts of outrage and fury from team obama and its allies in the aftermath of the president s speech _meta_end_dot_

 it is one thing to campaign with a chip on one s shoulder but after a while this gets rather tiresome does it not _meta_end_question_

 it should _meta_end_dot_

 but shockingly enough the controversy appears to have kicked into second gear now with team obama and its allies now claiming that if president bush wants to slam appeasers he should start with his own defense secretary and senator mccain who allegedly have adopted senator obama s negotiating strategy in toto _meta_end_dot_

 read on _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 of course these claims are ridiculous when examined closely _meta_end_dot_

 let s consider first the comments made by secretary gates a plan on how best to negotiate with iran _meta_end_dot_

 all of this of course would come as a revelation and a surprise to people like andrew sullivan who these days is more a cheerleader than he is an analyst who sifts through evidence carefully and thoughtfully in order to make reasoned conclusions _meta_end_dot_

 but sullivan s misrepresentations and misinterpretations of the issue notwithstanding it remains crucial to continue stressing that his preferred candidate would enter into negotiations with iran without a clear and serious strategy of _meta_number_ref_ what we could hope to get from the negotiations _meta_number_ref_ what we might be forced to give up _meta_number_ref_ at what point we might be expected to conclude that the negotiations are going nowhere and walk out of the negotiations as a consequence and _meta_number_ref_ what our best alternative to a negotiated agreement batna might be _meta_end_dot_

 if senator obama has actually worked out these details of his negotiating plan he hasn t been kind enough to reveal those details to the public and as mentioned earlier given senator obama s comment that he would meet with ahmadinejad without preconditions one might be forgiven for thinking that not too much in the way of details has been worked out in advance of any such negotiations _meta_end_dot_

 i am not opposed to talking to iran per se _meta_end_dot_

 but again if you want to talk to iran as with any other set of talks between nation states you have to have a negotiating strategy _meta_end_dot_

 here s mine and i m not even running for president _meta_end_dot_

 where is senator obama s _meta_end_question_

 as for the allegations concerning senator mccain they revolve around the argument that senator mccain has said that the united states will have to deal with hamas _meta_end_dot_

 these allegations stem from a recent washington post editorial that was penned by former clinton state department spokesman jamie rubin who claims that in an interview with senator mccain the senator stated that he would be willing to sit down with hamas and have a nice chat _meta_end_dot_

 thus presumably if senator mccain is a hypocrite for attacking senator obama s foreign policy positions and negotiating platform _meta_end_dot_

 the charge does not hold water _meta_end_dot_

 as pointed out here senator mccain did not call for unconditional talks with hamas a point that is reinforced here _meta_end_dot_

 lou dobbs doesn t get much right but you know what they say about stopped clocks don t you _meta_end_question_

 note in the video interview with jamie rubin that senator mccain states that part of any interactions with hamas will be dictated by how hamas acts not by how the united states acts if that isn t a clear indication that hamas has to give up the implementation of terrorism and asymmetrical violence in order to be treated like a genuine negotiating partner i don t know what is _meta_end_dot_

 but the noise machine that is in the possession of team obama and its allies does its very best to elide the above points incontrovertible as they are _meta_end_dot_

 instead of having the bulk of the mainstream media establishment point out that senator obama was in no way slighted by president bush s knesset speech and that there is contrary to what appear to be popular opinion a great deal of daylight between senator obama s position on talks with rogue states and factions on one hand and the positions of secretary gates and senator mccain on the other we get bizarre and hackish efforts to conflate the two positions _meta_end_dot_

 in addition we get oodles of media attention fulminating over an attack that never was on senator obama while ignoring all sorts of personal assaults against senator mccain and others who occupy a position on the center right of the american political spectrum _meta_end_dot_

 we also hear a lot about how senator mccain s famous temper will surely bring about world war iii itself while at the same time ignoring the supposed apocalypse inducing temper of other politicians who have a d next to their names including one who fairly recently was president of the united states _meta_end_dot_

 for those who wonder why it was necessary to create an alternative media establishment like the one that we have in the blogosphere the issues discussed in this post provide a clue _meta_end_dot_

 and concerning those who tut tut about the supposed avalanche of character assassination that is allegedly being directed at senator obama one waits for them to denounce with attendant fury the distortions of the positions of secretary gates and senator mccain and the personal attacks launched at senator mccain his exemplary service to the country notwithstanding and other center right politicians and thinkers who are accosted as naziesque by people who once were thought respectable and still are if only because there is no media coverage of their overly exuberant rhetorical pyrotechnics _meta_end_dot_

 until such denunciations are in the offing let us be spared the lectures _meta_end_dot_

 the would be lecturers are not impressing anyone _meta_end_dot_
