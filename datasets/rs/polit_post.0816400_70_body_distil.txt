  update via hot air a video made of awesome _meta_end_dot_

 or are you _meta_end_question_

 you are after all one of hillary s _meta_end_dot_

 let s just say one of hillary s and leave it at that probably not best to rock that particular boat right now_meta_beep_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 anyway via ben smith ben who seems to have been just the slightest bit soured on the entire obama thing good job ben smith comments section _meta_end_exclamation_

 damn good job goes on to note considering the advice that carville s giving why yes please put him in that slot senator obama _meta_end_dot_

 please _meta_beep_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 moe lane actually no men can have them too _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_beep_ref_this campaign season s turning out to be absolutely surreal _meta_end_dot_

 and that s assuming that senator clinton is actually going to follow through with giving up her donor list _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_beep_ref_let me explain for any confused lefty lurkers _meta_end_dot_

 it s like this al gore was pretty much raised in as close as you can get to a skinner box and not have your kids taken away by child services and the purpose of that skinner box was to make him president of the united states of america _meta_end_dot_

 his entire life was designed along those lines and i use the word deliberately the only reason that he doesn t have chips in his head is because the technology simply wasn t there at the time _meta_end_dot_

 so when he lost the election he got a little exercised about it which is polite talk for going bat expletive deleted nuts for a while the personality change is significant the guy s a shouter now not to mention considerably more glad handling than i personally remember him being _meta_end_dot_

 this may not bother the left but contemplating what happens when mr _meta_end_dot_

 i have a nobel peace prize clashes with i am the hope the change and the audacity should _meta_end_dot_

 gore will expect obama to defer to him and obama s not going to like that thought one bit _meta_end_dot_

 and i can t say that i d blame him for that one _meta_end_dot_

 this is by the way why gore couldn t be anybody s vp _meta_end_dot_

 it d have to have been the top spot or nothing _meta_end_dot_

 and if i know this it s for darn sure that carville does _meta_end_dot_

 he s not always right but he s rarely stupid _meta_end_dot_

 which makes me wonder what s being played here _meta_end_dot_
