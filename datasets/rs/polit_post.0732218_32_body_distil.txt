 for the last several years uga habitat for humanity s awareness week the climax of their activities for the year and generally the only non meeting activities they sponsor has also included a two day homeless awareness project _meta_end_dot_

 in this activity representatives of uga habitat attempt to raise awareness among their fellow students for the plight of the homeless by building cardboard huts out of their used pizza dvd player and hdtv boxes placing those homes at the student center in the middle of campus and then sitting around in them for a few hours at a time while listening to music and eating pizza and other fast food before retiring to their comfy dormitory or apartment bedrooms for the night no doubt utterly exhausted after having raised all of that awareness _meta_end_dot_

 unfortunately it appears that those most in need of raised awareness are the student members of uga habitat whose activities topped off by the supremely insulting cardboard sleepover display either a complete lack of comprehension about what it is that habitat for humanity as an organization does and who it is that it helps or a willful misrepresentation of the same for the purpose of garnering attention and donations and adding to their membership new bleeding heart adolescents who can actually be persuaded to believe that they are making a difference in the world by taking a few hour break from their video games to sit in cardboard boxes _meta_end_dot_

 then again given the penchant for sensationalism present among liberal college age activists perhaps uga habitat would have a great deal of trouble recruiting members and getting people to sign up for events if these student activists who prefer meaninglessly symbolic on campus gestures like sitting in cardboard boxes for a few hours in the name of homeless awareness or stuffing themselves with a pancake dinner in the name of hunger awareness to real work became aware of the truth that habitat for humanity has never housed an american homeless person _meta_end_dot_

 furthermore it has never given so much as a single free meal to a starving individual nor provided a free house for a person with aids or any other disease nor officially endorsed any activities raising awareness for the same _meta_end_dot_

 instead habitat for humanity pursues the far nobler goal of using volunteer labor a word that most college activists are as unfamiliar with as they are with its synonym work to construct affordable at cost housing for those who have the job income and credit to qualify for a mortgage but who have not been able to own a house before due to a variety of reasons _meta_end_dot_

 from habitat international s own website emphasis added habitat for humanity is the ultimate marketplace result of the compassionate conservative mindset in action men and women willingly volunteering their time to help those who are doing and will continue to do their utmost to help themselves and rewarding those who have been good stewards of their time and their money and who simply need one final push to get over the top and to become a homeowner _meta_end_dot_

 unfortunately good credit homes for those who qualify and are willing to work for them and other merit based attributes are not exactly slogans that resonate with today s activist college students a demographic which is intent on passively and sweatlessly making their mark in the world by raising awareness about the plight of the undeserving rather then by actually working to make a difference by helping those who have themselves worked to succeed in life _meta_end_dot_
