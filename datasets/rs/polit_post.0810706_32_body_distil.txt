  as this article points out it is going to be a whole lot harder to pursue an agreement in the context of the doha round of multilateral trade talks now that fast track authority for the u s colombia trade deal has been derailed and the deal itself has been put on the backburner indefinitely _meta_end_dot_

 incidentally it is laughable to suggest as the article quotes some as suggesting that the real problem here is that the bush administration sought to craft a bilateral deal with the colombians rather than paying exclusive attention to multilateral talks _meta_end_dot_

 my understanding was that the united states government could walk and chew gum at the same time and that the trade consequence of this was that we could pursue bilateral deals while at the same time working to hammer out a multilateral accord in the context of the doha round _meta_end_dot_

 but here apparently we are being told by those who are sympathetic to speaker pelosi s efforts to keep the u s colombia trade deal from being ratified that it is just not right for the united states to engage in bilateral diplomacy and create bilateral trade agreements not even when these agreements open foreign markets to american goods _meta_end_dot_

 additionally we are told that the speaker s actions may have been justified and responsible because they prevented an outright defeat of the trade agreement on the floor of the house _meta_end_dot_

 i have to think however that the reason the trade deal was put on the back burner was because speaker pelosi and her cohorts are protectionists or at the very least they want to do a good enough impression of protectionists to ensure that big labor supports democratic candidates this fall with full enthusiasm _meta_end_dot_
