  things have moved on _meta_end_dot_

 the early primary returns send a clear message about the will of the republican and in some cases democrat and independent voter beating the democrats is paramount now is not the time to lose more elections quibbling over ideology and philosophy _meta_end_dot_

 under a bush administration america has seen a steady and persistent drift to the middle _meta_end_dot_

 it s happened before so there s no reason to fear it or run in panic from it now just because the field of likely gop nominees to replace him share similar traits and tendencies _meta_end_dot_

 hell we were more conservative in congress under clinton than we have been since save for the tax cuts and the scotus fights miers notwithstanding _meta_end_dot_

 to the middle merely indicates the governed is hoping the governing will tone it down a bit and get to work doing a little more governing and a little less mud slinging and caterwauling _meta_end_dot_

 add a heaping helping of shut the hell up and do your job and that just about sums up where we are headed with the next presidency and congressional session s _meta_end_dot_

 we ve fairly well debated and in some cases vilified each other bloody over the status of conservatism in the gop this cycle and all the hot air that s going to be blown has been blown and has since dissipated _meta_end_dot_

 we ve talked about it here and here and here and as a parental bitchslap talked about it here as well _meta_end_dot_

 the msm is swimming in lamb s blood over the death of conservatism and the democrats have been suggesting its demise will offer a whole generation renewed hope and the possibility of realizing all their dreams if only those evil conservatives would go away and die somewhere _meta_end_dot_

 i get it _meta_end_dot_

 what we re left with are a few uncomplicated realities all of which have led me and i suggest everyone else who is focused on beating the democrats back from the white house doors to decide rudy giuliani must receive the republican nomination for the white house and be supported in the subsequent general election in november _meta_end_dot_

 rudy is not all things to all republicans _meta_end_dot_

 rudy is not a conservative _meta_end_dot_

 rudy has never apologized for being something different than he is and here s one of the clinchers for me he has never tried to convince us that he is something he is not _meta_end_dot_

 scream at me below the fold over where i get this wrong _meta_end_dot_

 there has been no success at any attempts i can find where a consensus is ever going to be reached regarding the meaning purpose or application of conservatism these days so i m not going to even try _meta_end_dot_

 what i can do is list the hot topics that matter to the majority of gop ers as best i can surmise _meta_end_dot_

 not from any sterile poll mind you but from the thoughts and sentiments around the net and the blogs and the off off broadway news sites _meta_end_dot_

 immigration economy security entitlements war and personal liberties in that order seem to comprise the bulk of things that are most likely to get voters to their feet and to the polls when called upon to do so _meta_end_dot_

 note to class abortion religious freedom being allowed to say christmas in december flag burning homosexual marriage and social security reform are not there _meta_end_dot_

 and our guns are not in danger of being taken out of our gun vaults any time soon either _meta_end_dot_

 so let s get it said _meta_end_dot_

 get over it _meta_end_dot_

 of course if you re like me anything that goes against your very being can still be enough to allow you with a clear conscience to abstain from voting or vote according to your beliefs _meta_end_dot_

 the thing is though the individual consciences are not in dispute here the overall health of a party and the need to defeat the opponent are all that matters _meta_end_dot_

 on immigration i see rudy s distinction from the others in the field very clearly he sees the need to get them in the system to make sure they are comfortable enough with law enforcement to engage them where potential threats might be found so they can feel free to report them _meta_end_dot_

 so too does he see far more merit in getting them educated than in leaving them run amok in the streets committing crimes and staying sufficiently uneducated so as to be permanent members on the entitlement doles _meta_end_dot_

 the others _meta_end_question_

 we can t deport em so what else are we going to do with em at least rudy is pragmatic and erring on the side of what upsides for the community there might be in getting them legal and getting on with our lives _meta_end_dot_

 the rest seem more concerned with voting bloc expansion than being pragmatic about law and order _meta_end_dot_

 on the economy he believes in tax cuts and doesn t waddle around whining about whether they benefit certain classes or whether the loss of tax revenue might prevent some little perk in the entitlements system from getting its standard budget allocation _meta_end_dot_

 he gets how much better life is for the government when taxes are reduced sufficiently to allow an influx of cash back to the tax man through consumption and investment _meta_end_dot_

 on security he was mayor on _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 no more needs be said on that point except to add that he s the only one still genuinely pissed off at fundamental muslims who need to see us dead or converted and he s willing to see them dead before they can realize their own dreams _meta_end_dot_

 period _meta_end_dot_

 on entitlements rudy has proven to use them to engage and sustain a demographic without hoping it will convince them to vote for him _meta_end_dot_

 he has proven that wisely managed people most likely to hurt the community by not being given a helping hand are the ones we most want to keep under our watchful eye _meta_end_dot_

 heck if congress is going to hand it out why not spend it if the restless and the helpless can be more productively engaged with the community they live in _meta_end_dot_

 on war as mentioned rudy s the only one still pissed off about _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ and still willing to hunt down and prosecute with the full force of the us military all those who would wage war against us _meta_end_dot_

 further he is more likely than most to negotiate reagan style at the un because he s the only one that actually worked for the man _meta_end_dot_

 on liberties rudy stands alone in unapologetically supporting everyone s right to do just whatever the bloody hell they want to behind closed doors and sees no reason to use the government to meddle in or get in the way of people exercising those rights _meta_end_dot_

 look the gop is in trouble _meta_end_dot_

 the gop is tearing itself apart over who is more or less than whom on any number of issues _meta_end_dot_

 but america is moving on and it seems to see the middle as some time out place where we can all regroup and get back to the business of tending to the needs and wants of the republic _meta_end_dot_

 giuliani may not bring back a reagan esque gop but for the moderates the gop has become this next _meta_number_ref_ years given where the democrats want to take us only rudy can fly them in a holding pattern and enjoy various successes on various issues across the aisle and back again _meta_end_dot_

 sure none of us are going to like all of it and many of the fill in the blank cons are gonna walk even though the purest of the pure already have but the gop needs a guy that can stay in the fight manage the areas the gop majority seems to care most about and keep big government to a dull roar _meta_end_dot_

 if this is the new gop it s gotta be rudy running it _meta_end_dot_
