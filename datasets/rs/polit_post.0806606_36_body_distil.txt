  i should have mentioned this last night but it deserves notice however late the notice may be john mccain really did give a terrific speech last night _meta_end_dot_

 especially impressive was his courageous endorsement of free trade and free markets something that is not fashionable these days unfortunately _meta_end_dot_

 the arguments mccain laid out for free markets were elegant easily accessible and could be used to blunt and counter democratic protectionist rhetoric that will continue throughout the primary season and into the fall _meta_end_dot_

 here s hoping that mccain keeps up this line of argument especially while hillary and obama tear each other apart in the weeks and months ahead _meta_end_dot_
