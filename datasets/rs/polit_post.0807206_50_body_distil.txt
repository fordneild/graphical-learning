  the spin efforts to make the spitzer scandal nothing more than a bush justice department sting operation against a political opponent has commenced _meta_end_dot_

 in the event that people are actually interested in how the investigation began not that scott horton really is interested mind you he just wants to throw out as much doubt as humanly possible to save a political figure he considers sympathetic they can read this to get a comprehensive understanding of how the investigation was launched _meta_end_dot_

 and amazingly enough horton actually links to this story which tells you why the feds were tipped off to the possibility that something may be wrong why they were looking into spitzer s payments um _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 the account is found in horton s own post _meta_end_dot_

 if that s not clear enough for him i don t know what will be _meta_end_dot_

 horton also goes on to argue that mann act violations should not be brought because in the past they were brought against people who perhaps should not have been prosecuted _meta_end_dot_

 the mann act isn t invoked that often but neither that nor the argument that it might have been abused in the past is an excuse for not bringing it now _meta_end_dot_

 and again structuring violations should be taken very seriously _meta_end_dot_

 but it appears that horton won t take them seriously because eliot spitzer is not a republican _meta_end_dot_

 spitzer did this to himself _meta_end_dot_

 no one else is responsible _meta_end_dot_

 people like scott horton can invoke the dread name of karl rove et _meta_end_dot_

 al _meta_end_dot_

 until the cows come home _meta_end_dot_

 it will avail them nothing _meta_end_dot_
