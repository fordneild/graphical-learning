  i do not mourn the pending doom of hillary clinton _meta_end_dot_

 i expect that barack obama is actually a more formidable candidate than hillary clinton _meta_end_dot_

 he will actually be harder to beat _meta_end_dot_

 he should not be _meta_end_dot_

 but he will be _meta_end_dot_

 the media portrays him as a likable fellow and agent of change _meta_end_dot_

 i suspect he will see a total of _meta_number_ref_ hours of bad press in the coming _meta_number_ref_ months _meta_end_dot_

 sure okay i think our chances against barack suck unless we have a mccain or a huckabee _meta_end_dot_

 i don t see romney or rudy beating him _meta_end_dot_

 thompson maybe because of the adult in the room factor _meta_end_dot_

 huckabee has jesus on his side and the media has invested a lot in john mccain _meta_end_dot_

 also i think another national security incident really hurts barack invade pakistan obama _meta_end_dot_

 he is after all still a novice _meta_end_dot_

 but i do not mourn the pending doom of hillary clinton _meta_end_dot_

 a lot of people think barack obama is a transformative politician _meta_end_dot_

 they think he will set the gop back a hundred years _meta_end_dot_

 i do not _meta_end_dot_

 read on _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 i see barack obama as a superficial media created agent of change _meta_end_dot_

 at heart like fred thompson said this past saturday night barack obama is a liberal _meta_end_dot_

 we are a center right nation _meta_end_dot_

 sure obama may get into the white house for four years _meta_end_dot_

 but he is a liberal _meta_end_dot_

 it is in his nature to govern as a liberal _meta_end_dot_

 it is in his nature to retreat from a strong defense _meta_end_dot_

 it is in his nature to raise taxes _meta_end_dot_

 it is in his nature to push forth the rusted hand of socialism onto the american entrepreneur _meta_end_dot_

 it is in his nature to undermine traditional america _meta_end_dot_

 and i suspect that he is really vapid and shallow _meta_end_dot_

 a smart man nor a smart man who is just inexperienced do not make the foreign policy pronouncements barack obama makes nor some of the public policy statements he has made _meta_end_dot_

 barack obama is a liberal _meta_end_dot_

 this nation despite the best efforts of many is not _meta_end_dot_

 he must talk right _meta_end_dot_

 he would govern left _meta_end_dot_

 and he has thus far shown no evidence that he is more than a shallow vessel into which others have poured their idealism _meta_end_dot_

 the only reason he is doing so well is because people have finally realized the clintons are about themselves not this country _meta_end_dot_

 and so they are finally hated by all _meta_end_dot_

 even the left wants someone interested in the country more than themselves _meta_end_dot_

 they too have tossed out the clintons _meta_end_dot_

 and they ve blessed our side with this very shallow vessel of other people s hopes and ambitions _meta_end_dot_

 even if we lose this year and history is against us i suspect those on my side who are extremely pessimistic about obama will come to see him as i do _meta_end_dot_

 and in the meantime i do not mourn the pending doom of hillary clinton _meta_end_dot_

 sure we could beat her but why take the chance when her own team is successfully repudiating the clinton machine _meta_end_dot_

 life is good _meta_end_dot_

 rejoice _meta_end_dot_
