  as polls open in michigan i m going to go on and call it _meta_end_dot_

 i say mitt romney wins michigan today which is going to make him extremely competitive going into super tuesday _meta_end_dot_

 i predict that not only will he relaunch his campaign but it ll be themed as unleashing the real mitt romney there ll be a purge of consultants etc _meta_end_dot_

 i take this as anticipating my prediction _meta_end_dot_

 whether the voters really buy it is going to be interesting to watch _meta_end_dot_

 btw i think a romney victory today is going to impact john mccain in south carolina and given an opening for huckabee and thompson _meta_end_dot_
