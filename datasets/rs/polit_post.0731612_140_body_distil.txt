  i expect we re going to start seeing more fights between friends like the present dustup between joe carter and the club for growth _meta_end_dot_

 cfg has been bashing the mess out of huckabee for his record in arkansas _meta_end_dot_

 joe is firing back pointing out a donor to cfg is also a huge porker _meta_end_dot_

 i don t know though cfg gets money from a private individual porker to go after a porker running for office _meta_end_question_

 i don t have a real problem with that especially when it s the far left salon that started off throwing the stones _meta_end_dot_

 i understand where joe s coming from on this but would suggest he might want to refute the message instead of trying to discredit the messenger _meta_end_dot_

 those on the right are never going to win the who s the hypocrite game the left invented that game _meta_end_dot_

 where this debate needs to head i think is to calm the fears of the business and financial community on huckabee _meta_end_dot_

 let s all be honest on social policies there are few if any candidates better than mike huckabee _meta_end_dot_

 my wife is most comfortable with mike because she points out he s willing to defend tough social issues that the left likes to slam us with _meta_end_dot_

 and those are her issues _meta_end_dot_

 but we need more than the social conservatives to win this thing and mike s message on executive salaries and carbon offsets scares the crap out of the business community _meta_end_dot_
