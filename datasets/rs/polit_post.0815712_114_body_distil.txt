  this is delightful news people in america often get the idea that what the government does is mostly irrelevant to their daily lives _meta_end_dot_

 the government is perceived as something that is far away and unimportant and of far less importance than many other things in their daily lives _meta_end_dot_

 recent events in zimbabwe and throughout africa demonstrate that this is a pleasant fiction enabled by the fact that we have never had a true and successful tyrant take charge in america _meta_end_dot_

 everyone by now knows the litany of ills that plagues the continent of africa disease famine war homelessness and corruption _meta_end_dot_

 the miseries of that continent have led many a well meaning individual and politician to make impassioned pleas for the united states to offer aid in whatever form possible to the people of africa _meta_end_dot_

 u_meta_number_ref_ frontman bono has been a rare purveyor of insight and common sense amidst this clamor for help _meta_end_dot_

 you see bono understands that the number one problem facing africa right now is not poverty or famine or even disease but governmental corruption _meta_end_dot_

 the last century in this country has established that virtually every climate can be made comfortably habitable for human beings given a stable and reasonably clean system of government that is dedicated to either building or fostering the development of basic infrastructure that reaches all of its citizens _meta_end_dot_

 the last century in africa has demonstrated that goverments are equally capable of deliberately keeping their populations in poverty and squalor so as to prevent the very possibility of their ouster from power _meta_end_dot_

 these governments have furthermore pilfered billions of dollars of aid destined for their people to corruptly enhance their own creature comforts at the expense of the lives and welfare of their citizens _meta_end_dot_

 ladies and gentlemen it matters who s running the government _meta_end_dot_

 government corruption isn t just a scandalous news story it s theft of the country s resources as a whole _meta_end_dot_

 and government that deliberately fosters dependence and poverty will make its population miserable compared to the government that focuses on the construction of necessary infrastructure and the protection of private property that is necessary for the creation of an economy jobs and wealth _meta_end_dot_

 these things have become abstract principles in america and we are in fact in danger of forgetting them _meta_end_dot_

 but for the people of zimbabwe who are desperately trying to throw off a selfish and evil tyrant who will stop at nothing to retain power the effects on their daily lives are all too real _meta_end_dot_

 i should hope that it would be obvious that i am not intending to compare any given politician to robert mugabe who is an evil and despicable human being _meta_end_dot_

 i do not believe that the most rabid liberal in this country would turn america into zimbabwe if given the chance _meta_end_dot_

 this is but a simple reminder of the fact that even in a democracy in which the electoral process is respected unlike in zimbabwe elections do indeed have consequences that can reach us all _meta_end_dot_
