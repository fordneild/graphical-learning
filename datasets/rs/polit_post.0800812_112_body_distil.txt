  our beloved leader erick makes a few observations about barack obama below _meta_end_dot_

 one in particular caught my eye from saturday s debate in new hampshire whoa _meta_end_dot_

 whoa _meta_end_dot_

 whoa _meta_end_dot_

 conveniently for us inconveniently for obama we ve looked at this timeline before for a different reason _meta_end_dot_

 as early as march _meta_number_ref_ the inestimable bill roggio was reporting on the anbar awakening from open sources _meta_end_dot_

 probably the earliest mentions of this was blogged by bill roggio in june _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 success in anbar province was evident and substantial before the _meta_number_ref_ elections were even held _meta_end_dot_

 is the man truly this stupid _meta_end_question_

 are what passes for his foreign policy advisers this stupid and he s simply a sock puppet _meta_end_question_

 does he think we re this stupid _meta_end_question_

 did he not know and simply make something up relying on the donovan mcnabb effect to keep him from being criticized _meta_end_question_

 none of the answers are pleasant to contemplate _meta_end_dot_

 the best we can hope for is a mediocre intelligence who surrounds himself with dolts so he can be the smartest guy in the room _meta_end_dot_
