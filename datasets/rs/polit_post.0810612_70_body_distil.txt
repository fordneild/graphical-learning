  leaving aside a pun he had probably spent years waiting to use david freddoso has an excellent piece on the complete collapse of opposition to a big ticket new ship for the national oceanic and atmospheric administration s ocean floor mapping project _meta_end_dot_

 noaa of course takes up close to _meta_percent_ref_ of the budget of the commerce department whose budget i looked at in greater detail here _meta_end_dot_

 freddoso s point is that ocean mapping is a classic example of a function that should be left to the private sector or at a minimum contracted out to private companies rather than performed by more expensive government employees read on _meta_end_dot_

 and freddoso warns that in the next presidential administration we could see major increases in government employment as the democrats roll back the progress that has been made on behalf of hard working taxpayers use of private contractors isn t necessarily the perfect solution if the government can t get competitive bids but even so it is cheaper than adding long term employees to the government s various obligations _meta_end_dot_

 the better solution will generally be to get more tasks out of government entirely _meta_end_dot_

 but instead of debating between those two alternatives the democrats just want to expand the number of workers dependent on salaries and benefits drawn from taxpayer money _meta_end_dot_

 and the gop sadly isn t expending much energy to stop them _meta_end_dot_
