 for the last eight years the democratic left has claimed that voting machines are the tools of electoral fraud in america _meta_end_dot_

 they claimed that the efficiency that makes them useful also makes them unreliable _meta_end_dot_

 however a lack of efficiency also has a cost unfortunately a personal one _meta_end_dot_

 on primary night in sutton new hampshire they used no voting machines _meta_end_dot_

 everything was done by hand _meta_end_dot_

 vote totals were read aloud and written down by hand onto the form sent to the state officials and in that process a mistake was made _meta_end_dot_

 ron paul s _meta_number_ref_ votes were missed with his line on the form left blank entirely _meta_end_dot_

 the mistake was corrected the next day in an updated fax when a polite voter asked why his vote for ron paul did not register in the official tally but that was too late to prevent problems for poor jennifer call sutton s town clerk _meta_end_dot_

 she became the target of a nationwide intimidation effort as deranged ron paul supporters across the country accused her of numerous crimes including treason and fraud _meta_end_dot_

 calling her at work and at home calling her primarily from out of state harassing her accusing her threatening her and using false identities at times the ron paul revolution turned this woman s life into a nightmare _meta_end_dot_

 says the concord monitor some say the republican party needs to reach out to these people because we may not draw them into the fold if we reject ron paul too strongly _meta_end_dot_

 i hope they re right i hope these people never identify republican a day in their lives _meta_end_dot_

 let their nazi brownshirt tactics of intimidation stay put outside of the legitimacy of a peaceful national party _meta_end_dot_
