  barack obama is no stranger to gutter politics _meta_end_dot_

 he will tell you for the next _meta_number_ref_ months that he is the victim of it _meta_end_dot_

 i call bs _meta_end_dot_

 barack obama plays gutter politics _meta_end_dot_

 yesterday he said that john mccain was losing his bearings an unsubtle attack on mccain s age _meta_end_dot_

 i ll get to the mccain campaign s response _meta_end_dot_

 but first i want to point remind you of one of the great un der reported stories of the democratic primary barack obama s sexist attacks on hillary clinton _meta_end_dot_

 jake tapper first noted this when obama said that hillary was taking out the claws at the same time he noted that obama would use l anguage such as when she s feeling down periodically she launches attacks tapper noted that a number of female reporters and bloggers picked up on this _meta_end_dot_

 later obama complained that hillary was throwing the china at him _meta_end_dot_

 again tapper heard the dog whistle _meta_end_dot_

 tapper noted that this feeds into the harridan caricature of clinton so when obama attacks mccain with an age based smear it shouldn t be surprising _meta_end_dot_

 mark salter one of mccain s senior advisors nailed it _meta_beep_ref_br
