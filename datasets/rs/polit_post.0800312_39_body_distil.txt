  stories like this at the politico hack me off _meta_end_dot_

 i have great respect for jonathan martin but this is a rather below the belt article _meta_end_dot_

 it s like dan rather calling florida for gore while the panhandle is still voting _meta_end_dot_

 in fact sources in the thompson campaign tell me that they have a solid ground game operation going on in iowa _meta_end_dot_

 i also know that more than one campaign s internal polling has reflected what zogby has seen a late breaking surge toward thompson _meta_end_dot_

 notice again that the politico talks to republican officials close to thompson when they actually talk to a thompson advisor s he tells them exactly what has already been reported _meta_end_dot_

 so i can only look at this politico article and wonder who has decided they want to sabotage the thompson campaign _meta_end_dot_

 it seems the media has made a game of it _meta_end_dot_

 the fact of the matter is thompson has made no secret that he needs a strong third place showing in iowa _meta_end_dot_

 it s also no secret that were he to drop out he d probably endorse his friend john mccain _meta_end_dot_

 a headline like this though and an article like this really is nothing but a media generated device to tap down turn on for thompson _meta_end_dot_

 i m sure that was not the politico s intention but considering they aren t really breaking any news that couldn t wait until tonight after the results were known makes them look as shallow as fox news has looked lately in its treatment of the thompson campaign _meta_end_dot_

 updated making the rounds this morning several people are fingering mccain guys for initiating this article _meta_end_dot_

 i know at least two campaigns are also seeing a late breaking surge for fred _meta_end_dot_

 mccain s invested in the i ll be a surprise third story line so it makes some sense that mccainiacs would push this _meta_end_dot_
