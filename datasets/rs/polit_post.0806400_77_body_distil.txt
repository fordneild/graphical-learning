  before i go any farther just why is it that every tinpot two bit dictator beloved of the american hard left eventually ends up screaming about the jews _meta_end_question_

 yeah that s what you d call a rhetorical question _meta_end_dot_

 anyway things are getting bad down there fausta has more links for the interested h t glenn _meta_end_dot_

 for my own part i m generally taking colombia s side on this one given that they re a blowing up communist rebels which is in itself a meritorious act particularly when said rebels are also narcotics smugglers b an ally of the usa that is actively trying to claw its way out of the current mess that it s in and c not screaming about how their enemies are just like israel which believe it or not was actually meant as an insult _meta_end_dot_

 as i said rhetorical question _meta_end_dot_
