  venezuelan president hugo chavez had a tough december but i predict that we ll see him finding new and creative ways to amass power unto himself in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 that s what wanna be socialist dictators do _meta_end_dot_

 but after getting rejected at the polls and facing inflationary pressures he s going to have to work harder at it _meta_end_dot_

 yesterday the chavez government announced that it was launching a new currency more below the fold _meta_end_dot_

 chavez grew his economy on the back of the state owned oil industry funneling oil revenues into his socialist social programs _meta_end_dot_

 the problem is that he shrank the venezuelan oil industry in the process anyone who got a c or getter in econ _meta_number_ref_ could have seen this coming _meta_end_dot_

 chavez was lucky that oil prices rose as they did _meta_end_dot_

 investors in the venezuelan economy took a beating in _meta_number_ref_ with the stock market losing _meta_percent_ref_ of its value over the last twelve months _meta_end_dot_

 too bad chavez didn t take the king of spain s good advice and shut up _meta_end_dot_
