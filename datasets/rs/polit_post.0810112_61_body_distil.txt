  i must say the boys at the dnc really aren t that bright _meta_end_dot_

 they ve tried to take me to task over my email blast yesterday in which i wrote the dnc dimwit writes obama equates a standing army s presence with being at war _meta_end_dot_

 in addition to showing his total ignorance of military issues it s how he has justified misquoting mccain _meta_end_dot_

 my point is that we have military bases in the southern u s japan and germany _meta_end_dot_

 that does not mean we are at war with any of them _meta_end_dot_

 but using barack obama s logic we could certainly suppose that we are still at war with each one _meta_end_dot_

 the dnc dimwit though goes on apparently he never learned the difference between cause and condition in grade school _meta_end_dot_

 mccain said if not because there is a huge difference _meta_end_dot_

 likewise the guy was joined by some other blogger who wrote or iraq _meta_end_dot_

 in fact everyone in the administration has been clear that should the iraqi government ask us to leave we would leave _meta_end_dot_

 and considering we ve pretty much handed over to the iraqi government approval for various operations in the country we can t really be considered occupiers _meta_end_dot_

 none of that will stop the democrats from lying though _meta_end_dot_
