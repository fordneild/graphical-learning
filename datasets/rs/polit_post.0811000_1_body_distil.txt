  chairman dean what exactly is it that you do all day _meta_end_question_

 because while i may just be a republican one of those people that you hate as well as hate everything that i stand for i have to say if your job is to help the democratic party grow and thrive you re not precisely doing the best job at it _meta_end_dot_

 this was not a smart thing to say at this point in the game h t hot air read on _meta_end_dot_

 ed in the hot air link above wrote about some of the internal complications of this call of dean s let me focus on the tin ear aspects of it _meta_end_dot_

 the difficulty here for the chairman is that he s recognized that there s a problem the democratic primary process has been weakened by decades of neglect and meddling to the point that it looks likely to collapse under the strain of its first real test in _meta_number_ref_ years but he s trying to fix it by elevating the choices of a group of elites over the democratic party voting public _meta_end_dot_

 you might argue that in this he is merely emulating his party s basic nature and you would be of course right _meta_end_dot_

 but there is a difference between swooping in to resolve a conflict and muscling in to end an annoyance _meta_end_dot_

 if after the last primary the super delegates do all gather together as originally called for something i didn t and don t think is all that likely mind you in order to resolve any doubts about who the nominee was going to be well it s still not the best way to run things but at least all the voters had their say _meta_end_dot_

 and if the voters didn t like the choice they d at least have a shot at the convention to make their displeasure known _meta_end_dot_

 in other words this would not be a good outcome but it would also not be the worst outcome _meta_end_dot_

 this proposal however _meta_end_dot_

 it reveals that howard dean and by extension the democratic establishment cares more for a quick choice than they do the people s choice _meta_end_dot_

 and that he s willing to contemptuously dismiss the opinion of the remaining democratic voters many of whom are excited to actually have a voice in a primary decision for a change just in order to be able to know ahead of time which name to put on the balloons _meta_end_dot_

 mind you most of the states involved aren t going to vote democratic anyway and he s obviously ready to risk the ones that do which is pragmatic i suppose but hardly in line with his pious rhetoric about supporting the democrats in every state _meta_end_dot_

 mind you he could have gotten away with a call like this several months ago _meta_end_dot_

 back then most people still believed that the race would be over by now anyway _meta_end_dot_

 but he didn t and just in case any democrats reading this are wondering no you cannot actually afford to spot the gop any electoral votes this year _meta_end_dot_

 i don t care what your pet pundits and or political gurus are telling you in fact they re the ones who have helped set up the political map so as to ensure that most of the major electoral battles are on blue state soil _meta_end_dot_

 again _meta_end_dot_
