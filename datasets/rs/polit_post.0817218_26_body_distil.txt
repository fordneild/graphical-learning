  good afternoon our colleagues from the other side _meta_end_dot_

 as you no doubt know by now the fisa bill has passed the house _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ complete with sufficient protections for the telecom industry so as to prevent precisely the sort of discovery expeditions that so many of you have so eagerly dreamed of _meta_end_dot_

 the senate will in due course ratify it the president will of course sign it and it will not be repealed even if your party somehow manages to win the presidential election in november _meta_end_dot_

 but i would like to offer these words of comfort _meta_end_dot_

 when you look back on your quest to fight this bill i want you to appreciate the amazing amount of work that you spent on the issue _meta_end_dot_

 you networked _meta_end_dot_

 you wrote letters and blog posts _meta_end_dot_

 you contributed to opposition groups _meta_end_dot_

 you reached out and found people just like you and you banded together to fight _meta_end_dot_

 and you kept going and calling and struggling and you put your time your money and every atom of your being on the line _meta_end_dot_

 for some of you this was your finest moment _meta_end_dot_

 you fought for this _meta_end_dot_

 you fought so hard for this _meta_end_dot_

 oddly enough i didn t do any of that but i won anyway _meta_end_dot_

 that s because you suck and i don t _meta_end_dot_

 well i didn t say that they were words of comfort for you _meta_end_dot_

 moe lane ps now go give money to barack obama _meta_end_dot_
