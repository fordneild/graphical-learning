  replace it with a similar approval from senator mccain and we ve got a hypothetical mccain campaign ad for the national election via hot air i say hypothetical because it presumes that that the only candidate left that it d work on is the democratic nominee _meta_end_dot_

 clever of you to find a method of attack that doesn t get in the way of the vrwc not that we re not going to go after you in the general anyway of course _meta_end_dot_

 read on _meta_end_dot_

 last day of the break folks last day of the break _meta_end_dot_

 after this the next month kicks into high gear guam on _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ indiana and north carolina on _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ west virginia on _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ kentucky and oregon on _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ puerto rico on _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ and montana and south dakota on _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 many people are eager to tell you what they so clearly see as being the inevitable results in fact i m one of them _meta_end_dot_

 it s just that my prediction of how the next month will unfold is that at the end of it the only real difference will be that both democratic candidates will look considerably more tired _meta_end_dot_

 oh and that we re going to have a lot of people telling us that candidate insert name here is doomed _meta_end_dot_

 and that they ll usually be doing it in a very loud voice _meta_end_dot_

 i don t know if that still counts as one prediction _meta_end_dot_
