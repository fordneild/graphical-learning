  with my own apologies to diane duane for using the reference huh _meta_end_dot_

 odd _meta_end_dot_

 i was under the general impression that the primary qualification you looked for in a foreign policy adviser was the elementary wisdom not to blurt out embarrassing statements abroad via the corner although i don t think that they salt their popcorn properly the senator s already had to apologize which is both funny and no doubt a disappointment for his acolytes who expect him to come out swinging against the lies and slimes of the clinton smear machine or whatever the phrase is _meta_end_dot_

 ms _meta_end_dot_

 powers has too saying that these comments do not reflect my feelings about sen _meta_end_dot_

 clinton whose leadership and public service i have long admired pause this has just been a marvelous week hasn t it _meta_end_question_

 read on _meta_end_dot_

 first off isn t it just horrible the way that we evil evil vrwc types aren t staying on message _meta_end_question_

 i imagine that the obama campaign is thoroughly peeved at us right now we were supposed to not have the willpower to refrain from kicking the woman when she was down _meta_end_dot_

 instead we ve actually managed to act in our long term interest by doing our part to extend the democratic primary system beyond all rhyme or reason even if it does mean beating up on a one term senator whose chicago politics history becomes clearer every single day _meta_end_dot_

 that s probably why he hasn t gone negative before now by the way he was expecting us to and it took him a little too much time to adapt_meta_beep_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 not that we mind how things are likely to go in the future _meta_end_dot_

 second wow _meta_end_dot_

 that was just really _meta_end_dot_

 stupid of ms _meta_end_dot_

 powers wasn t it _meta_end_question_

 not only the monster bit as glenn noted we tend to reserve that word for worse sorts these days but for the first sentence in that quote _meta_end_dot_

 bad enough for senator obama that this woman is flubbing her way across europe right now_meta_beep_ref_ now she s calling the basic competency of the campaign in question not to mention offering a blanket insult to a state that is still technically red on the map _meta_end_dot_

 yes _meta_end_dot_

 that is very helpful _meta_end_dot_

 to the gop _meta_end_dot_

 and lastly this is just march _meta_number_ref_th _meta_end_dot_

 imagine what wonderful gaffes and sound bites we ll have to play with on april _meta_number_ref_th _meta_end_dot_

 from both sides _meta_end_dot_

 moe lane you can argue that we haven t done much to help that scenario but you can t really say that we ve done anything really to hurt it _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_beep_ref_but we are taking notes for the general so there s always vicarious revenge senator obama _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_beep_ref_hey europe _meta_end_exclamation_

 remember if obama wins you ll probably get stuck dealing with ms _meta_end_dot_

 powers on a regular basis for the next four years _meta_end_exclamation_

 still hating on the unilateralist simplisme cowboy _meta_end_question_

 at least with him you don t have to pretend to be best chums _meta_end_dot_
