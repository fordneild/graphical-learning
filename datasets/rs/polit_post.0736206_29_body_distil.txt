  us district judge jeffrey white threw out part of a san francisco law this afternoon one that required employers to provide or pay for medical insurance for employers _meta_end_dot_

 white ruled that the federal employee retirement income security act erisa preempts and prohibits the states from imposing such requirements on employers _meta_end_dot_

 ordinarily i wouldn t care because san francisco is such a freaky place and if a conservative worried about every bad bill passed there he d never sleep _meta_end_dot_

 but this is important because governor schwarzenegger s plan for all of california includes a similar requirement and thus could also be illegal under erisa _meta_end_dot_

 read on _meta_end_dot_

 to be honest i d never heard of erisa before today _meta_end_dot_

 i have an opinion neither on whether it s a good law or a bad law nor whether the law is correctly interpreted here _meta_end_dot_

 judge white was appointed by president bush in _meta_number_ref_ for what it s worth _meta_end_dot_

 he s also the judge that put two san francisco chronicle reporters in jail for failing to reveal their source of barry bonds secret grand jury testimony _meta_end_dot_

 that all sounds good so i ll give him the benefit of the doubt and assume he s right here in interpreting erisa _meta_end_dot_

 if he s right then ab_meta_number_ref_x the schwarzenegger democratic hillarycare lite bill that passed this month and will be debated in the senate come january could also be in trouble _meta_end_dot_

 says the chronicle not that ab_meta_number_ref_x is even guaranteed to get out of committee in the senate so i m still not worried about our state economy being trashed _meta_end_dot_

 governor schwarzenegger may be trying to do his best to link arms with assembly speaker fabian n ez d los angeles to block job creation in this state but senate democrats or the courts may yet save us from this monster we nominated and elected _meta_end_dot_
