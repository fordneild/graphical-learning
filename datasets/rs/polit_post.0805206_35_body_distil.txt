  as aoshq noted you d almost think that the democrats were being irrational about trying to shut down our ballistic missile defense program or something _meta_end_dot_

 hey do either of the two democrats still running for president have a quote on that _meta_end_question_

 anyway note that it s just a navy ship that means that the next navy ship that you meet just might be one of the ones that can take out things in orbit _meta_end_dot_

 best not to mess with her on general principles no _meta_end_question_
