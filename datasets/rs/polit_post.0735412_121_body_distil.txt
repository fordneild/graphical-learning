 as if there weren t already plenty of good reasons to consider moving michigan s economy into the _meta_number_ref_st century by making it a right to work state we get one more heck of a good reason via this morning s associated press _meta_end_dot_

 yesterday the michigan civil service commission decided that it s ok for unions to automatically deduct political donations directly from the paychecks of public employees _meta_end_dot_

 in other words if their decision stands the unions will have direct access to tax dollars to help fund their hate campaigns against conservative candidates _meta_end_dot_

 and make no mistake when the union thugs start campaigning things can get down right hateful _meta_end_dot_

 i remember walking the route of the _meta_number_ref_ labor day parade in detroit with dick devos and his family _meta_end_dot_

 we quickly picked up a large contingent of very angry union thugs screaming obscenities _meta_end_dot_

 but that was nothing _meta_end_dot_

 par for the course _meta_end_dot_

 it s tough to expect thugs to behave in a civil manner _meta_end_dot_

 the shocking part came as we passed a checkpoint where the city of detroit had a firetruck and an ambulance _meta_end_dot_

 one thug walked up behind the candidate and screamed into his ear you see that ambulance _meta_end_question_

 you just remember where it was _meta_end_dot_

 you keep walking and you re going to need it thanks to the civil service commission pretty soon those will be your tax dollars at work _meta_end_dot_

 not that they re going to get away with it that easily _meta_end_dot_

 if and that s a big if the initiative does happen and does make the ballot it might make for a crowded couple of pages what with all of the other initiatives in the works these days _meta_end_dot_

 according to the detroit news that s the big one but there s also a chance we ll see a proposal for glorified hillary care universal taxpayer funded health care _meta_end_dot_

 think granholm would be able to keep her no new taxes pledge and the legalization of herb _meta_end_dot_

 talk about a fun november and an interesting combination _meta_end_dot_

 in one fail swoop the voters of michigan could decide to legally use tax dollars to purchase marijuana for glaucoma sufferers _meta_end_dot_

 glaucoma sufferers who d like to keep their jobs but would rather not be in a union _meta_end_dot_

 sadly there are a few hundred michigan workers who don t have that choice this week _meta_end_dot_

 they may still be in the union but according to the ivory tower they don t have their jobs anymore _meta_end_dot_

 looks like chrysler is going to lay off several hundred workers by tomorrow _meta_end_dot_

 talk about rotten timing _meta_end_dot_

 the weekend before christmas _meta_end_question_

 not an easy situation _meta_end_dot_

 oh and i did a check _meta_end_dot_

 nowhere in the article or anywhere else in this morning s fishwrap does governor granholm comment on the matter the way she did earlier this week when we learned the state might get _meta_number_ref_ new jobs over _meta_number_ref_ years _meta_end_dot_

 here we re losing _meta_number_ref_ jobs in one day and immediately but not a peep _meta_end_dot_

 and her honorary press spokesman tom walsh nary a peep from him either _meta_end_dot_

 but hey the press they re not biased _meta_end_dot_

 and jennifer granholm _meta_end_dot_

 not a political opportunist at all _meta_end_dot_

 although i guess the only other conclusion would be that she s cold and callous to the plight of the jobless _meta_end_dot_

 has to be one or the other although i suppose it could be both br
