  it comes as no surprise that in the wake of barack obama s impressive win in iowa and hillary clinton s attendant stunning loss that many pundits are now talking of an obama nomination with the same tone of inevitability that they reserved for hillary clinton s once certain nomination _meta_end_dot_

 there can be no doubt that the clinton campaign has suffered a tremendous blow _meta_end_dot_

 but nothing on the democratic side has been settled and while obama has gone a long way towards getting the nomination he likely still faces what is very much an uphill fight _meta_end_dot_

 first of all the contest between clinton and obama is in keeping with a very familiar pattern to democratic nominating contests _meta_end_dot_

 these contests almost invariably come down to a struggle for the nomination between a the machine candidate and b the idealistic insurgent _meta_end_dot_

 equally invariably the machine candidate wins _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 consider the following democratic nomination contests _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 machine candidate incumbent president jimmy carter _meta_end_dot_

 idealistic insurgent senator edward kennedy former california governor jerry brown was also a candidate for the nomination it should be noted _meta_end_dot_

 despite tremendous excitement over the fact that another kennedy was seeking the presidency carter crushed kennedy using the powers of his office and his control over the democratic party to ruthlessly out organize kennedy in primaries and caucuses _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 machine candidate former vice president walter mondale _meta_end_dot_

 idealistic insurgent senator gary hart _meta_end_dot_

 despite hart s new ideas theme a theme that did lead him to some surprising victories over mondale mondale was ultimately able to take the democratic presidential nomination in relatively decisive fashion _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ was an outlier nomination contest as there was no major machine candidate _meta_end_dot_

 hart may have played that role but he was forced out early thanks to rumors of an extramarital relationship between him and donna rice _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 machine candidate governor bill clinton _meta_end_dot_

 idealistic insurgent former senator paul tsongas _meta_end_dot_

 according to the quest for the presidency clinton was angry over the fact that tsongas was the new ideas candidate who was the favorite of the npr crowd and he sought in some way to be the idealistic insurgent because it played to his self conception as a candidate of fresh and bold initiatives _meta_end_dot_

 his advisers warned him off that route _meta_end_dot_

 while the new democrat theme pursued by clinton was a break with tradition it nevertheless represented a machine reaction to tsongas s calls for fiscal restraint and his derision of clinton as a pander bear for his according to tsongas dramatically large spending priorities _meta_end_dot_

 the clinton campaign accused tsongas of not wanting to provide for democratic spending priorities sufficiently deficit hawkism did not permeate the clinton inner circle until after the _meta_number_ref_ election _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 machine candidate vice president al gore _meta_end_dot_

 idealistic insurgent former senator bill bradley _meta_end_dot_

 bradley had gore worried for a little bit but gore decisively won the iowa caucus and then defeated bradley in new hampshire _meta_end_dot_

 bradley dropped out immediately thereafter _meta_end_dot_

 in _meta_number_ref_ the machine candidate is quite clearly hillary clinton _meta_end_dot_

 the idealistic insurgent is obama _meta_end_dot_

 indeed clinton and obama may be said to be archetypes of the machine candidate and the idealistic insurgent respectively _meta_end_dot_

 the past is not always prologue but if the past is any guide obama still has a lot to worry about _meta_end_dot_

 even if we put the past aside we ought to consider that clinton has a lot of staying power _meta_end_dot_

 her war chest remains huge _meta_end_dot_

 her establishment backing is impressive and intimidating and of course the establishment has no vested interest whatsoever in seeing its preferred candidate losing the nomination contest for that loss may signify the need of the establishment to give way to obama s movement _meta_end_dot_

 the compressed primary caucus season means that there are fewer and more compressed breaks between contests that would allow for a decent and reasonable interval for a candidate with clinton s stature to fall on her sword and surrender the nomination to obama _meta_end_dot_

 the _meta_number_ref_nd president of the united states is of course heavily invested in this fight and as the first democratic president since fdr to win re election bill clinton is not going to want to see the voters give his wife the thumbs down in what amounts in many ways to a referendum on his presidency _meta_end_dot_

 add to all of this the fact that the words clintons and give up power without a fight really don t belong in the same sentence and you begin to understand the enormity of the task still facing obama _meta_end_dot_

 i don t underestimate the impact of iowa _meta_end_dot_

 not one little bit _meta_end_dot_

 it represents the most catastrophic defeat any of the clintons have suffered in an election cycle that had them on the ballot _meta_end_dot_

 at the same time there is no death rattle emanating from the clinton campaign _meta_end_dot_

 the clintons have only begun to fight and it is far from inconceivable that at the end of the day hillary clinton will achieve the democratic presidential nomination _meta_end_dot_

 whether that nomination is worth having after a long and protracted struggle is another question _meta_end_dot_

 but barack obama shouldn t be writing his acceptance speech just yet _meta_end_dot_

 his task may well remain far more sisyphean than hillary clinton s is _meta_end_dot_
