  there is a very disturbing article in the washington post today and i m not talking about the iseman story _meta_end_dot_

 this story is about how the fec will not let sen _meta_end_dot_

 john mccain withdraw from the presidential financing system _meta_end_dot_

 federal election commission chairman david m _meta_end_dot_

 mason issued a letter to the mccain campaign yesterday notifying them that the commission had not granted his february _meta_number_ref_th request to withdraw from the system _meta_end_dot_

 the washington post cites these two reasons in their article read on _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 the public financing system prevents mccain from spending more than _meta_dollor_ref_ million before he formally accepts the gop nomination in september _meta_end_dot_

 the problem is he has already spent over _meta_dollor_ref_ million _meta_end_dot_

 with only _meta_dollor_ref_ million left to spend this will drastically affect his ability to travel hold fundraisers employee staff organize swing states and start using paid advertising direct mail television radio the web for the general election _meta_end_dot_

 penalties for breaking the spending cap are server _meta_end_dot_

 according the washington post knowingly violating the spending limit is a criminal offense that could put mccain at risk of stiff fines and up to five years in prison sen _meta_end_dot_

 obama is currently raising an absurd amount of cash right now _meta_end_dot_

 last month he raised over _meta_dollor_ref_ million _meta_end_dot_

 patrick ruffini in an article today estimated that obama could raise over _meta_dollor_ref_ million _meta_end_dot_

 if mccain cannot opt out of the public financing system we are looking at facing an extremely up hill battle for the white house this november _meta_end_dot_

 i m certain the democrats in the senate are very aware of this scenario and i would not be surprised if they are intentionally blocking the four necessary fec appointments needed for quorum in order to secure the white house _meta_end_dot_

 getting these appointments through is the only way mccain will be able to get out of the system _meta_end_dot_

 we must do everything in our power to prevent this from happening _meta_end_dot_

 first we need to bring this to the public s attention _meta_end_dot_

 there is a chance the msm will ignore this until it s already too late _meta_end_dot_

 we need to call out the democrats for severely hindering the electoral process _meta_end_dot_

 this election is too important to be decided in the senate and once the public finds out they will be outraged _meta_end_dot_

 second we need every republican member of the senate to unite together in order to push through our president s appointments to the federal election commission _meta_end_dot_

 finally we need to donate money to the mccain campaign _meta_end_dot_

 he may need to pay off his entire _meta_dollor_ref_ million loan before opting out of the system _meta_end_dot_

 we need to help him do this _meta_end_dot_

 anyone who knows me will tell you that i m certainly not a huge mccain fan but i realize that there is far too much at stake to let obama and clinton win this election _meta_end_dot_
