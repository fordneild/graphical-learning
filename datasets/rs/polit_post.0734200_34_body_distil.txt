  michael goodwin of the new york daily news is on cnn and just said that huckabee is exploiting anti mormon bias in iowa _meta_end_dot_

 the guy was already down on huckabee for being religious _meta_end_dot_

 this strikes me as a damned if you do damned if you don t moment _meta_end_dot_

 huckabee by talking about his faith exposes himself as a christian which is a selling point _meta_end_dot_

 if he doesn t talk about it he doesn t drive home a major selling point among evangelicals _meta_end_dot_

 but by talking about it idiots like this can accuse him of exploiting anti mormon bigotry _meta_end_dot_

 look there are certainly people pushing the anti mormon angle _meta_end_dot_

 it s by and large the press in iowa _meta_end_dot_

 huckabee may be benefiting from evangelicals wanting one of their own but don t accuse the man of pushing bigotry _meta_end_dot_

 if anything the media has been turning up its nose at him because he dares to wear his faith on his sleeve _meta_end_dot_

 it s the drive by press engaging in bigotry _meta_end_dot_

 the media like the left hates religion _meta_end_dot_

 they hate romney for daring to talk about it yesterday _meta_end_dot_

 they hate huckabee for talking about it articulately _meta_end_dot_

 so now they have no problem accusing either of bigotry _meta_end_dot_

 look at the washington post attacking romney for ignoring atheists in his speech _meta_end_dot_

 they don t like it _meta_end_dot_

 and people like michael goodwin are happy to lie about huckabee because they view any talk of religion as a threat _meta_end_dot_
