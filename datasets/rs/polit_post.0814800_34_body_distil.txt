  yet _meta_end_dot_

 but the senator s going to have to address the details of this tnr piece via glenn reynolds on the way that al qaeda s name is rapidly taking on the characteristics of mud among the very groups and cultures that they were hoping to impress with _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 particularly since as a member of the senate committee on foreign relations senator obama is theoretically in a perfect position to either confirm or deny the arguments made by tnr _meta_end_dot_

 although that doesn t explain why he hasn t talked about it before now well one more thing for him to clear up _meta_end_dot_

 senator obama is welcome to take his time of course _meta_end_dot_

 every day that he sticks to his current narrative that the war is lost and we must flee is one more day where he becomes ever more inextricably attached to that narrative for good or for ill _meta_end_dot_

 probably ill in his case _meta_end_dot_

 given that reality is showing a distressing tendency to not care about senator obama s election prospects _meta_end_dot_

 none the less he can still get out of this _meta_end_dot_

 all senator obama has to do is go on the air and admit that he was wrong _meta_end_dot_
