  cnn is helping set the stage for the democrats to stand up as the quitters they are only this time iraqi soldiers must be declared beaten before the battle is over _meta_end_dot_

 nothing new here folks move along now _meta_end_dot_

 two days is enough time to determine that wherever there is resistance from an enemy the good guys need to tuck tail and run _meta_end_dot_

 go on for a while is all the democrat media wing needs to hear stiff resistance fight is lost _meta_end_dot_

 re tooled and re armed by his stick buddy ahmadinejad mookie is hunkering his sorry fat butt down in a mosque somewhere while his thugs and minions are executing what appears to be phase iii of a proclaimed civil disobedience against the iraqi government _meta_end_dot_

 civil disobedience apparently translates into armed insurrection over in iraq imagine the spray paint toting hippies down on constitution ave _meta_end_dot_

 performing this kind of civil disobedience ak _meta_number_ref_ and ied in hand where do you think that would go in a matter of hours instead of days _meta_end_question_

 more below the we like winning fold _meta_end_dot_

 nonetheless as the iraq government and its military commands and commanders confront sadr s army and attend to the self destruct mess sadr s goons are making of their own country the wringing of hands and gnashing of teeth here on the home front continues unabated _meta_end_dot_

 if you chose to listen to other folks say bill roggio for example via instapundit you might think iraq is gearing up and getting after these traitors to their own country _meta_end_dot_

 heck you might even find reason for optimism that given enough time to sort through the mess and assess the situation on the ground there and allocate the necessary resources to the effort we might actually get this thing done of course that would not jibe well with the formula for defeat we ve had to listen to for the past _meta_number_ref_ or _meta_number_ref_ years there are people who s political ambitions rest squarely in the laps of american and iraqi defeat after all _meta_end_dot_

 consider michael goldfarb s blog and a post there again by roggio _meta_end_dot_

 which suggests that we give war a chance again via instapundit it s important to note well for those of us that actually prefer to win wars and see all the bad guys killed that these things take time and hard work and sacrifice of course democrats don t see the world this way they see everything through the prism of what can someone give me that i don t have to actually do anything to earn and as hard as roggio tries to explain this effort and sacrifice it s unlikely that the media wing of the democrat party will ever get it putting aside the quick call from cnn and others to assume defeat and prepare for more bad news in the days ahead it should not go unstated that mookie is already calling for an end to the fighting and seeks a political solution he s starting to sound an awful lot like a couple democrats i know _meta_end_dot_

 letting roggio have the last word here so much more eloquently than i could ever say it i give you this food for thought too bad the democrats and the msm don t get it _meta_end_dot_
