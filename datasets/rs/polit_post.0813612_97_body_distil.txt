  with the latest setback in a house special election virginia s tom davis who formerly headed the nrcc has the long knives out for current head tom cole _meta_end_dot_

 but his diagnosis of the problem seems more a symptom than a cure h t _meta_end_dot_

 now as it turns out when you go to davis actual memo a copy of which is available through the weekly standard he has a mixed bag of suggestions some good and some not so good _meta_end_dot_

 but the long time moderate davis will have a hard time selling skeptical conservatives on his suggestions if the first thing out of his mouth is that the gop shouldn t be fighting the few battles where it has truly stuck its neck out for fiscal responsibility _meta_end_dot_

 read on _meta_end_dot_

 what follows are the specific prescriptions in davis memo which follow pages and pages of appropriately grim polling and fundraising data is it really true that jc watts is giving money to democrats these days _meta_end_question_

 ugh _meta_end_dot_

 as i said some of these are good ideas some not so much not much new here but davis has a point about how the white house could put a bit more public pressure on the dems to commit themselves to doing nothing _meta_end_dot_

 ditto no new ideas but at least fight for what we have _meta_end_dot_

 the use of the term tar baby while an accurate metaphor is perhaps unfortunate given the divide between mccain and the base on this issue it s a sleeping dog best left that way for _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 at this point it becomes clear that davis is perhaps a bit too concerned with blaming bush for all the message problems _meta_end_dot_

 which is partly fair but not entirely _meta_end_dot_

 i agree with him on nclb but it s a program that for well known reasons has few friends on the right and nothing but enemies on the left _meta_end_dot_

 on taxes the rhetoric on both sides of the aisle may be stale but that s because we have been fighting this same battle for four decades _meta_end_dot_

 davis isn t suggesting a tax simplification agenda which is the one way to break some of the stalemate but also historically a quixotic task _meta_end_dot_

 nothing new here _meta_end_dot_

 i m not sure much mileage here can be gotten from just blaming the democrats for waiting until after the presidential election to do much on healthcare everyone knows a thing that big doesn t get done without white house leadership _meta_end_dot_

 the medicare prescription drug issue is a quagmire the gop can tout it because it s popular but it s also a fiscal catastrophe and one that was properly opposed by just a hardy few conservatives and iconoclasts john mccain among them _meta_end_dot_
