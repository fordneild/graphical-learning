  it s a little trick that the drug traffickers came up with or stole down in south america _meta_end_dot_

 what you do is you go up to a recalcitrant obstruction and you give him or her a choice between getting either lots of money or a bullet in the head and the point is you don t really care which one the obstruction picks _meta_end_dot_

 either one will clear the obstruction _meta_end_dot_

 and i bring up this fascinating yet not ostensibly relevant cultural phenomena why _meta_end_question_

 because nancy got a letter _meta_end_dot_

 oh yes it gets better _meta_end_dot_

 read on _meta_end_dot_

 h t hot air the full text if you ve ever wondered what _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ million dollars looks like well now you know eighteen of the signatories are official hillraisers which means that they ve each collected at least _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ for hillary clinton s election campaign _meta_end_dot_

 bear in mind that to do that they had to go out and convince other people to donate money to hillary s campaign which means that they have both fund raising skill and personal influence _meta_end_dot_

 alternatively they know how to fiddle with the campaign finance laws sufficiently well to pump ferocious amounts of personal cash into the system _meta_end_dot_

 either way they are valuable to a political organization _meta_end_dot_

 and they re making a rather pointed threat here _meta_end_dot_

 while the dccc is currently flush with _meta_dollor_ref_ million on hand the nature of house elections is such that they ll be spending every dime before the end and go looking for more _meta_end_dot_

 and they ll be hitting up people precisely like these folks for help _meta_end_dot_

 so _meta_end_dot_

 silver or lead and the obstruction this time is the super delegates nervous desire to re establish order _meta_end_dot_

 hillary s financial supporters and we don t know how representative they are one in ten isn t a bad number to start with have just told the speaker of the house that if she tries to end this race prematurely then she can get to hear the noise that all politicians fear the sound of checkbooks flapping shut _meta_end_dot_

 given the current number of freshman democrats in bush districts plus the prospects of pickups from retirees and the seats that actually need defending _meta_end_dot_

 a loss of big money bundlers can kill the democrats planned expansion program dead and nancy knows it _meta_end_dot_

 and pelosi can t go to the dnc for help given that dean s spent the last few years burning through the cash it s gathered in order to make the idaho democratic party feel better about being surrounded by all those awful republicans _meta_end_dot_

 on the other hand the pressure from the more plebeian parts of the democrats base will be intense as an examination of tpm s comments section would suggest _meta_end_dot_

 the speaker s biggest hope has to be that it s a bluff on hillary s big money people s part _meta_end_dot_

 or that the plebes will blink first _meta_end_dot_

 which to be fair they have a habit of doing _meta_end_dot_

 either way interesting times folks _meta_end_dot_

 interesting interesting times _meta_end_dot_
