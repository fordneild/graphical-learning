  this takes me by surprise too though when one considers all of the money that can be made in lobbying the decision by lott to leave is less surprising _meta_end_dot_

 it is well known that he was a reluctant candidate in his last re election effort and though he appears to have enjoyed his return to the leadership lobbying seems to hold more allure _meta_end_dot_

 i hope that jon kyl takes lott s place _meta_end_dot_

 he is highly intelligent and deeply substantive and he is an excellent parliamentarian and inside player precisely the kind of person who ought to be a whip and perhaps a future leader for senate republicans _meta_end_dot_

 the other candidates to replace lott don t appear to measure up _meta_end_dot_
