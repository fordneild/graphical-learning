  economics commentator and redstate friend larry kudlow opines in national review s corner that stock market investors are having a bad reaction to the disappointing and slightly insane political primary _meta_end_dot_

 kudlow points out that four of the closely watched primaries including super tuesday either coincided with or immediately preceded multi percentage point declines in us stock markets _meta_end_dot_

 he s right on the money when he says that stock market investors who ultimately care primarily about the outlook for corporate earnings have gotten nothing good to listen to from any candidate at any time in this un bear ably sic long primary _meta_end_dot_

 before i continue about this let me apologize for my recent silence _meta_end_dot_

 as you ll see i don t have a lot of respect for the political primary that has been the bulk of the news _meta_end_dot_

 more to the point i ve been busy lining up capital for a new venture _meta_end_dot_

 i m sure this will disappoint some of you but i have not been singing in die walk re nor am i the ghost of kirsten flagstad _meta_end_dot_

 more _meta_end_dot_

 i enjoy listening to larry kudlow s radio show which airs on saturday mornings on wabc radio in new york but i ve never seen his television program which i understand is much more frequent _meta_end_dot_

 i responded to one of his saturday programs here _meta_end_dot_

 i m not a political debate junkie _meta_end_dot_

 from where i sit this year s presidential campaign is all about whether age comes before beauty _meta_end_dot_

 the only substantive reason any of the candidates have given us to prefer him or her is that none of them is george w _meta_end_dot_

 bush _meta_end_dot_

 change _meta_end_exclamation_

 change _meta_end_exclamation_

 change in terms of economic policy there s nothing to choose among the democrats _meta_end_dot_

 both of them have consistently promised bigger taxes and more government control _meta_end_dot_

 and i can think of no reason to doubt their sincerity _meta_end_dot_

 among the republicans the only consistent statements on economics from any candidate have been that the government needs to create more jobs _meta_end_dot_

 the republicans might as well be democrats _meta_end_dot_

 as a businessman my only reasonable expectation is that the next administration whoever is elected will make my life less prosperous and more difficult _meta_end_dot_

 so i think there s potentially a lot to larry s idea that the political follies have discouraged stock investors _meta_end_dot_

 and do read his piece for the hopeful signs about the economic advisory team that mccain has begun to assemble but still i don t buy it and the reason is that most professional investors aren t swayed by what s happening in politics _meta_end_dot_

 none of the wall street people i talk to on a daily basis are looking at politics except as comic relief _meta_end_dot_

 among business people the stress is on the slowing economy _meta_end_dot_

 the true watchword in stock markets is uncertainty _meta_end_dot_

 and the key uncertainty is this are the credit markets simply licking their wounds after taking a gargantuan margin call from residential real estate and soon from commercial real estate _meta_end_question_

 or have we entered a secular period of lower risk tolerance across the board _meta_end_question_

 if the former we ll have a couple of soft years followed by a tepid us recovery and strong recoveries overseas _meta_end_dot_

 if the latter _meta_end_dot_

 well i don t even want to think the word much less say it out loud _meta_end_dot_

 but it starts with d the outlook is extremely uncertain all over the world _meta_end_dot_

 while us stock markets are down sharply since the beginning of this year and will plunge again this morning our declines have been comparatively mild _meta_end_dot_

 stock markets in other regions of the world are getting taken out and shot _meta_end_dot_

 the signals being thrown off from bond and commodity markets are more mixed _meta_end_dot_

 the economic mood of ordinary americans always has a great deal of impact on political elections _meta_end_dot_

 and as we go through what will obviously be a very challenging year it s going to be hard for the politicians to resist biting at the populist apple _meta_end_dot_

 to the extent that the eventual winner actually follows through on whatever rash promises he or she will make we ll be in for additional economic pain next year and subsequently _meta_end_dot_

 but the stock market follows its own demons _meta_end_dot_

 it s now a trading market and it will continue to swing wildly probably for the rest of the year as investors search for leadership and direction _meta_end_dot_

 the impact of politics on the stock market is minor at best _meta_end_dot_
