  as you know i ve been following the bear stearns situation closely and passing along information and my interpretations for you _meta_end_dot_

 i ve tried to stay neutral data driven and politically circumspect in dealing with a situation that is fluid and dangerous but highly technical and confined to the financial world _meta_end_dot_

 there was a question from a self identified left wing libertarian on another thread that got me wondering how are they reacting to this on the left _meta_end_question_

 a quick unscientific survey of the left blogosphere reveals their continuing obsession with politics at the congressional district level _meta_end_dot_

 the only front page stories contain snippets from new york times wall street journal and wire stories with no interpretation _meta_end_dot_

 on dkos there is nothing at all on the front page _meta_end_dot_

 they re obsessing over algae blooms evil credit card companies how we re secretly losing the war in iraq and how obama is being sold down the river by evil racists that would be us in case you were wondering _meta_end_dot_

 there s one diary on bear stearns and it picked up _meta_number_ref_ comments _meta_end_dot_

 all it did was regurgitate quotes from the wall street journal and calmly note that the sky is falling _meta_end_dot_

 what was the commentary like _meta_end_question_

 wow _meta_end_dot_

 i d forgotten how people think in the reality based community _meta_end_dot_

 read on _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 there were several major threads to the discussion _meta_end_dot_

 obviously they all want to impeach chimp that s the president of the united states and cheney for conspiring to destroy bear stearns while simultaneously saving it with taxpayer dollars _meta_end_dot_

 if you can figure it out let me know _meta_end_dot_

 there was a long digression about how the moonies are behind all this trouble _meta_end_dot_

 again don t ask me _meta_end_dot_

 and of course they all know that the iraq war caused the financial crisis _meta_end_dot_

 that and alan greenspan _meta_end_dot_

 and don t forget that the clintons started all the trouble with nafta and deregulation _meta_end_dot_

 dkos evidently has turned into obama mania central while i wasn t looking and while kos himself was sucking up to hillary clinton obviously the main concern of our friends on the left at least those who post at dkos centers on the political aspects of this _meta_end_dot_

 they want to make absolutely sure that the democratic party doesn t splinter so they can duly get barry obama into the white house and end the evil clinton bush cheney nexus of power that has destroyed the economy _meta_end_dot_

 and they do think the economy has been destroyed _meta_end_dot_

 comment after comment screams about how the bear stearns failure means that the financial markets are going to melt down _meta_end_dot_

 and what s bad about that _meta_end_question_

 they fear that it will throw working people sic into abject poverty _meta_end_dot_

 yes folks on the left they actually do believe that their material well being is controlled not by their own ingenuity energy education and willingness to work hard _meta_end_dot_

 instead they think their fates are held in the hands of evil plutocrats who with the click of a keyboard enrich themselves at the expense of poor people in towns and villages all over the world _meta_end_dot_

 what do they intend to do about it _meta_end_question_

 well they expect president obama to put an end to all this financial innovation that s causing ordinary people to be thrown out of their homes _meta_end_dot_

 they say they believe in capitalism but they want it carefully regulated and heavily taxed _meta_end_dot_

 to their credit they recognize to some extent how much pain this will cause although in typical fashion they kneejerk back to politics one commenter assured them that we evil republicans engineered the financial crisis and nominated a weak candidate mccain in order to ensure that a democratic president clinton or obama will have to deal with the mess and the recession _meta_end_dot_

 then we ll be able to swoop confidently back into power in _meta_number_ref_ just as reagan did after carter cleaned up nixon s economic mess _meta_end_dot_

 wish i d thought of that _meta_end_dot_

 once more with feeling the bear stearns crisis was a crisis of confidence not of solvency _meta_end_dot_

 people don t trade with a counterparty that they have questions about _meta_end_dot_

 they withdraw their short term funds and they trade with other desks _meta_end_dot_

 wall street is a ruthless place and what happened tonight is not unprecedented _meta_end_dot_

 the federal reserve acted aggressively and correctly to ensure that all of bear s counterparties were protected and to avoid a crash _meta_end_dot_

 these are financial problems not economic problems _meta_end_dot_

 we are in a recession but that s a different issue although related to be sure _meta_end_dot_

 apart from the people who lost their jobs the collapse of bear stearns should have no lasting impact on the larger economy _meta_end_dot_

 if it had taken dozens of other firms with it that s a totally different story _meta_end_dot_

 and maybe four billion dollars in shareholder equity got wiped out tonight _meta_end_dot_

 that s a sustainable hit _meta_end_dot_

 it s not the case as one bizarre dkos commenter said that the economy is doomed to collapse because it will take _meta_number_ref_ to _meta_number_ref_ trillion dollars to bail it out money that the fed doesn t have _meta_end_dot_

 generally speaking i believe in democracy ladies and gentlemen _meta_end_dot_

 but the failure of wall street firms scares me a lot less than the fact that people in the reality based community who don t actually know how to think will be voting this november _meta_end_dot_
