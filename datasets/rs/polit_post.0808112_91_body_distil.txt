  i posed the question yesterday if hillary s penchant for exaggeration and her scandal plagued past was going to be an issue in the campaign _meta_end_dot_

 obama has answered my question with a loud yes _meta_end_dot_

 it is true that he isn t going after the old scandals but he is taking the issue of character head on _meta_end_dot_

 mark helprin has reproduced a scathing memo from the obama campaign hitting hillary hard on the issue of honesty _meta_end_dot_

 details below the fold _meta_end_dot_

 here is a key section of the memo ouch _meta_end_exclamation_

 obama is going after hillary s biggest vulnerability honesty and trust _meta_end_dot_

 check out this graph it will be interesting to see if these theme resonates with voters and if obama continues to press the issue in the run up to pennsylvania _meta_end_dot_

 after all sometimes the best defense is a good offense _meta_end_dot_

 cross posted at the stop her now blog _meta_end_dot_

 update some of you may be wondering why i posted a long quote from an obama campaign memo _meta_end_dot_

 well i figure maximum damage is the goal here and i think the issue of hillary s character is bound to turn ugly in a democratic primary _meta_end_dot_

 plus i find the whole issue fascinating _meta_end_dot_

 and yeah i enjoy attacks on hillary no matter where they come from _meta_end_dot_
