 hillary she said would win the key states she called this race a tie she wants to have a really productive discussion she thinks this period will not be a negative rather it will be one during which the dems can contrasts themselves with the bush mccain plan bradley thinks the candidate with the most elected delegates should be the nominee _meta_end_dot_

 this is a ten state race all the way through to the convention he pointed out that north carolina and indian combined have more total delegates than does pennsylvania _meta_end_dot_

 he also threatened that any superdelegate who goes against the voters in his district who went for obama is risking a primary the next time _meta_end_dot_

 it s politics if a politician is primaried over which dem candidate he she supported this is a serious divisive issue on a similar plane as the war in iraq to the dems for michigan and florida bradley said that the rules are the rules he suggested a _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ division and he blamed the state parties for any voter disenfranchisement _meta_end_dot_

 schieffer asked him about the white democrats taking the nomination from a black democrat even when he s leading going into the convention _meta_end_dot_

 panetta pointed out that hillary was a woman and the party has to pull together behind whoever wins _meta_end_dot_

 or we ll pull defeat from the jaws of victory schieffer brought up mayor doug wilder saying on fns that the _meta_number_ref_ dem convention in chicago would be nothing compared to what would happen in denver should that scenario play out _meta_end_dot_

 panetta accused wilder of overstating the case _meta_end_dot_

 he thinks the party will be unified _meta_end_dot_

 schieffer asked why this campaign had become so negative _meta_end_dot_

 panetta said that he hopes that both candidates have to understand that this has to be on a higher plane _meta_end_dot_

 he said that we have huge crises two wars and the war on terror high gas prices worst economy since the _meta_number_ref_s etc _meta_end_dot_

 he said that this has nothing to do with race or sex it has to do with taking the country forward _meta_end_dot_

 schieffer asked if hillary had to put barry on the ticket and panetta said that they have flexibility _meta_end_dot_

 if this is a divided convention he said it may take some kind of combined ticket schieffer s interview with panetta was certainly harsher and more accusatory than that with patrick but in the end he concedes that he has it in his noggin that hillary will triumph _meta_end_dot_
