  one of the most common arguments for ratifying barack obama s nomination is pretty much a nakedly racial one he s african american and if he doesn t get the job african american voters who are overwhelmingly both democrats and obama supporters are going to be infuriated at the democratic party _meta_end_dot_

 that means that they will stay home on election day and hand off the presidency to the republicans _meta_end_dot_

 let us for the moment assume that this is in fact true although it s interesting that so many people apparently seem to think that white women are collectively more capable than african americans at getting past personal disappointments to vote what they perceive to be their long term interests _meta_end_dot_

 but that s another post _meta_end_dot_

 anyway again let s say that this is true _meta_end_dot_

 does it actually matter _meta_end_question_

 read on _meta_end_dot_

 in case you haven t noticed i like playing with maps _meta_end_dot_

 i put this together a month ago for private consumption i don t know why i haven t brought this up before _meta_end_dot_

 at any rate let s look at the bad paint jobs map _meta_number_ref_ shows states with a high percentage of african americans data via here _meta_end_dot_

 pretty straightforward i picked _meta_percent_ref_ as the cutoff _meta_end_dot_

 light green represents states with more than _meta_percent_ref_ african american population dark green more than _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 map _meta_number_ref_ shows the states that each democrat has won red for clinton blue for obama the darker shades of colors represents states won with significant african americans populations _meta_end_dot_

 note that montana and south dakota s results don t matter in this context _meta_end_dot_

 map _meta_number_ref_ has all the red states of _meta_number_ref_ in gray and all the blue states w out significant african american populations in black _meta_end_dot_

 that leaves michigan new york dark red new jersey and pennsylvania for clinton and delaware the district of columbia illinois maryland for obama all dark blue _meta_end_dot_

 conclusions _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 if obama is not the nominee i m going to say that his three high african american states and one district will not be pickups for the gop _meta_end_dot_

 maryland comes closest but it isn t really _meta_end_dot_

 of clinton s only ny is very high african american percentage and she should be able to keep it anyway home field advantage _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 if clinton is not the nominee obama s four are locks but while new york new jersey should still be fine for the democrats pennsylvania and michigan are currently battleground states and given the way that the obama campaign has utterly bungled _meta_beep_ref_ each of these two states primaries we have a much better chance of beating him in either or both than we do if clinton s the nominee _meta_end_dot_

 bottom line the question for the democrats is whether squashing obama s candidacy will actually cause a net loss for them in votes _meta_end_dot_

 the democratic party can take the hit in dc delaware illinois maryland much more easily than they can in pennsylvania and michigan _meta_end_dot_

 house races don t really signify thanks to majority minority districting rules and as for senate races _meta_end_dot_

 they ll be in trouble in the louisianan and way ahead in the virginian senate races with or without the african american vote _meta_end_dot_

 so you tell me _meta_end_dot_

 moe lane of the _meta_number_ref_ red states with significant african american populations the only one really at issue is virginia and i don t think virginia turns blue this election cycle anyway _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_beep_ref_losing doesn t count as a bungle _meta_end_dot_

 losing while offering personal insult to the voters does _meta_end_dot_
