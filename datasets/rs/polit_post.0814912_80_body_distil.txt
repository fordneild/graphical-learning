  there s not much more that needs to be said than what haystack said but let me pile on a bit _meta_end_dot_

 since i began blogging i ve begged and pleaded for the white house to fire the guy _meta_end_dot_

 he was a terrible press secretary who now resorts to sounding like one of the kos kidz _meta_end_dot_

 i have no doubt he ll be trolling here shortly after registering his account at fire dog lake _meta_end_dot_

 in fact moe blammed some dude last night with texas in his name though that could have been nick lampson _meta_end_dot_

 scott mcclellan was probably the worst press secretary in the history of the press operation at the white house _meta_end_dot_

 he looked like a deer in headlights any time he was behind the podium _meta_end_dot_

 just witness the professionalism of ari and tony on either side of him _meta_end_dot_

 he was busch league in the bush league _meta_end_dot_

 it s a really crappy way to repay his boss and friend by then throwing everyone else under the bus to save his skin _meta_end_dot_

 but i can t really blame him _meta_end_dot_

 so bad was he at his job he needs some sort of excuse other than gross incompetence in order to work again _meta_end_dot_

 i guess this is his way to rebuild his resume and get back out there in the job market _meta_end_dot_

 still i think history will bypass his work of fiction and recognize that mcclellan was in over his head too small for a big office and not very good at his job _meta_end_dot_

 to make himself larger he s now resorted to tearing down bigger men than himself _meta_end_dot_

 you know what kids say on the playground when one of them passes gas _meta_end_question_

 first one to cackle laid the egg well scott i think you laid the egg _meta_end_dot_

 suck it up and deal with it _meta_end_dot_

 and get back under the rock _meta_end_dot_

 geez _meta_end_dot_

 no class with this guy _meta_end_dot_

 or per haystack he who smelt it dealt it _meta_end_dot_
