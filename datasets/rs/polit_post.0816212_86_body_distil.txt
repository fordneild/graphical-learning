  we have been through this time and time again _meta_end_dot_

 the left and its media allies cannot accept that the country s leaders especially those leaders with a democrat d near their name found it necessary to authorize the use force in the war the islamic extremists continue to wage against us _meta_end_dot_

 the left s solution has been to fabricate a myth that we were mislead into war _meta_end_dot_

 despite the fact that no less than three exhaustive reviews have completely discredited this mythical lie last week the democrat controlled senate intelligence committee chaired by west virginia democrat john d _meta_end_dot_

 rockefeller iv tried to try and rewrite history and thereby breath new life into this despicable myth _meta_end_dot_

 as a few democrats realize success in iraq will be a problem for the democrats _meta_end_dot_

 now that the success of the surge is being recognized by the press if not the democrat s standard bearer those that once supported the war but switched positions with the prevailing political winds are growing desperate _meta_end_dot_

 the only way those democrats who once supported the war and thereby offended the democrats agenda setting antiwar left wingers can see to hold onto power is to blame their support for the war on being mislead _meta_end_dot_

 fred hiatt takes a look at rockefeller s new report revised history and finds rockefeller has not yet accomplished the left s mission _meta_end_dot_

 hiatt explains that if you bother to read rockefeller s new report revised history you will find that it fails to support rockefeller s assertion that the administration repeatedly presented intelligence as fact when it was unsubstantiated contradicted or even nonexistent read on there is much more _meta_end_dot_

 it is peculiar that it is rockefeller who is now pushing the bush lied myth _meta_end_dot_

 peculiar because it was the committee s vice chairman senator christopher bond along with three other republican senators filed a minority dissent and assert that they were cut out of the report s preparation allowing for a great deal of skewing and partisanship but that even so the reports essentially validate what we have been saying all along that policymakers statements were substantiated by the intelligence let us again review the facts at least the way history stood before rockefeller s attempt at rewriting history _meta_end_dot_

 history before it was rewritten again no fewer than three exhaustive reviews have determined that we were not mislead into war _meta_end_dot_

 the bipartisan senate select committee report on the u s _meta_end_dot_

 intelligence community s prewar intelligence assessments on iraq found no evidence of political pressure to change the intelligence community s judgments related to iraq s weapons programs _meta_end_dot_

 at pages _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ the report states the robb silberman commission on the intelligence capabilities of the united states regarding weapons of mass destruction likewise found no evidence of political pressure at pages _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ the robb silberman report states the british butler report review of intelligence on weapons of mass destruction similarly found no evidence of deliberate distortion at page _meta_number_ref_ the british butler report states rewritten history in the committee s rewritten history according to the new york times the new report concluded that president bush and his aides built the public case for war against iraq by exaggerating available intelligence and by ignoring disagreements among spy agencies about iraq s weapons programs and saddam hussein s links to al qaeda that s funny in the peculiar sort of way _meta_end_dot_

 more history before it was rewritten here is what rockefeller and other democrats said before the history was rewritten the consensus that iraq had weapons of mass destruction formed in the clinton administration _meta_end_dot_

 the consensus was more than evident in _meta_number_ref_ when president clinton was threatening to attack iraq _meta_end_dot_

 president clinton secretary of state madeline albright politicizing intelligence the democrats have tried to politicize intelligence before _meta_end_dot_

 in january _meta_number_ref_ during the senate s battle over how much money will go to each party to pay for committee staff senate democrats successfully insisted on changing the staffing structure of the select committee on intelligence _meta_end_dot_

 the democrats change divided the committee s staff into two groups reporting separately to the panel s republican chairman and democratic vice chairman _meta_end_dot_

 in a prescient moment senator pat roberts r _meta_end_dot_

 kansas then the incoming chair of the committee warned jim geraghty wrote by the end of _meta_number_ref_ it was revealed that the democrats had gone even further in their efforts to politicizing intelligence _meta_end_dot_

 a leaked memo caught the democrats plotting to use classified information against president bush in the _meta_number_ref_ presidential campaign _meta_end_dot_

 the contents of the memo drafted by the senate intelligence committee s democratic staff and reported by fox news can be found here _meta_end_dot_

 you probably remember democratic senator zell miller s heads should roll reaction former democratic senator bob kerrey who served as vice chairman of the senate select committee on intelligence was critical of this attempt to politicize intelligence _meta_end_dot_

 in an article entitled a political threat to u s _meta_end_dot_

 security kerrey wrote the democrats have politicized intelligence before _meta_end_dot_

 they didn t get away with it in _meta_number_ref_ and they shouldn t get away with it now just because they attempt to do so under the guise of a poorly rewritten history _meta_end_dot_
