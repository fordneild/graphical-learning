  as with all my conversations today i ll preface this by saying isn t it a wonderful new day in venezuela _meta_end_question_

 i m feeling so magnanimous after the pro freedom anti chavez vote that i decided to actually read what paul krugman has been up to lately _meta_end_dot_

 and sure enough he has an opinion about the current mortgage related financial disorders _meta_end_dot_

 krugman is not a dummy _meta_end_dot_

 on the contrary he s both an accomplished economist and an astute observer _meta_end_dot_

 he just has a way of letting his ideology do his thinking for him so he sometimes gets things backwards _meta_end_dot_

 let me tell you what i mean _meta_end_dot_

 i m hesitant to link to krugman s op ed in current online editions of the new york times because the times requires a registration _meta_end_dot_

 you won t have a hard time finding it but i ll describe his thinking here _meta_end_dot_

 it s quite succinct _meta_end_dot_

 he starts by quoting hyperbolic remarks by bill gross the chief investment officer of allianz s pimco unit and one of the world s smartest bond investors that have appeared in quite a few places already _meta_end_dot_

 he goes on to say that financial innovation is to blame for the contagion that is widely believed to be having powerful negative effects on real economic activity around the world _meta_end_dot_

 this is an important point for you to understand because krugman is sounding a clarion call that will be taken up by democratic political contenders if our economy does actually slide into recession _meta_end_dot_

 in essence your food and fuel are more expensive and your job is at risk because some fancy pants rocket scientists on wall street got greedy at one point krugman turns the tables on treasury secretary paulson _meta_end_dot_

 on several recent occasions paulson has said that financial innovation has gotten ahead of government regulation but that he d rather things be that way than the other way around _meta_end_dot_

 krugman s riposte is that your final answer mr _meta_end_dot_

 secretary krugman s brief analysis of the financial crisis that exploded last summer and has recently re ignited is basically correct _meta_end_dot_

 liquidity has become severely constrained around the world in response to uncertainty about the true levels of risk in portfolios of mortgage backed securities _meta_end_dot_

 he makes the right connection when he says that the increased uncertainty gave rise both to the proximate liquidity crisis and to reduced credit formation around the world _meta_end_dot_

 and the latter effect is of course the channel through which stress is being transmitted from the financial world to the real world of jobs goods and services _meta_end_dot_

 but where does he locate the source of the problems in mortgage backed securities _meta_end_question_

 on the innovative financial engineering that created those securities in the first place _meta_end_dot_

 like many other commenters paul krugman tells us that greed and flim flammery induced a small number of operators to convert risky mortgages into securities that because of their high ratings were snapped up by a wide range of investors including banks and hedge funds that had no business buying these things _meta_end_dot_

 he goes on to conclude that financial engineering while not evil in itself should not be allowed to proceed unless it s carefully regulated by governments _meta_end_dot_

 and this part of the story will resonate powerfully in next year s politics _meta_end_dot_

 think about what will happen when rep _meta_end_dot_

 barney frank the chairman of the house banking committee will have to sign off on innovative financial vehicles _meta_end_dot_

 we will see financial innovation completely dry up except for those activities pursued by firms that successfully lobby frank s committee _meta_end_dot_

 the financial industry which is the only global industry that americans still dominate will become hobbled and politicized _meta_end_dot_

 real innovation will move to other countries to escape our regulations _meta_end_dot_

 but what was behind the financial innovation itself _meta_end_question_

 in a phrase hunger for yield _meta_end_dot_

 global investors have long eyed the huge american market for home mortgages _meta_end_dot_

 a mortgage can often be more creditworthy than a commercial credit _meta_end_dot_

 businesses just go bankrupt when they fail but homeowners go on the street so they go to great lengths to avoid that but mortgages are tricky and complicated unlike standard fixed income securities so they have always been out of reach for investors other than traditional mortgage lenders _meta_end_dot_

 what changed was the pooling of mortgages into apparently conventional securities following successful securitizations of credit card receivables and subprime auto loans _meta_end_dot_

 when this happened back in _meta_number_ref_ and _meta_number_ref_ huge floods of money from nontraditional mortgage lenders suddenly became available to american homebuyers _meta_end_dot_

 the increased supply of money sharply reduced prices for mortgages but it also put pressure on the retail channel to absorb it all _meta_end_dot_

 and mortgage brokers and originators responded by reducing their lending standards _meta_end_dot_

 this was the imbalance that caused the bubble in housing prices the subsequent crash higher default rates and the reduction in values of the mortgage backed securities that started the whole cycle _meta_end_dot_

 i should say right here that it s probably the correct interpretation that mortgage backed securities fed too much systemic risk into the financial system _meta_end_dot_

 but just as with the long term capital management crisis in _meta_number_ref_ the nature and extent of this risk was not clear from financial models _meta_end_dot_

 instead it appeared in ways not predicted or understood by any theory _meta_end_dot_

 paul krugman is saying that the mortgage finance industry intentionally took on too much risk _meta_end_dot_

 but this is what he gets backwards _meta_end_dot_

 the people who bought mortgage backed securities weren t reaching for higher risk _meta_end_dot_

 they were doing the opposite _meta_end_dot_

 the amount of risk they thought they were taking was not high enough to justify the expected returns _meta_end_dot_

 that s perhaps an unorthodox view of the genesis of asset bubbles but it does explain the outcome _meta_end_dot_

 now if we get a recession it seems inevitable that calls for greater financial regulation will grow _meta_end_dot_

 and if democrats take the white house and consolidate their power in congress next fall mr _meta_end_dot_

 krugman will get his wish and financial innovation will be sharply curtailed _meta_end_dot_

 while we re throwing babies out with the bathwater let s remember a few things about the modern financial world which is completely based on mathematical results from what is sometimes called neoclassical economics and which krugman of all people understands very well _meta_end_dot_

 these mathematical models are the source of the financial engineering that led to mortgage backed securities _meta_end_dot_

 for all their flaws we can t get rid of them any more than we can get rid of derivatives and global capital markets _meta_end_dot_

 the genie is out of the bottle _meta_end_dot_

 regulating them will make us all poorer _meta_end_dot_

 and ironically it will only increase global demand for risk free us treasury debt _meta_end_dot_

 what few people in the developed economies seem to do much of is to seek for alpha or above market risk adjusted rates of return in traditional business development _meta_end_dot_

 creating wealth by building commercial enterprises is a model that seems to have moved to the developing world _meta_end_dot_

 i don t want to argue against financial innovation _meta_end_dot_

 with secretary paulson i don t believe that killing it with regulation is the answer _meta_end_dot_

 what is the answer _meta_end_question_

 as i ve said elsewhere we should take the regulatory gloves off american businesses and let them start competing in export markets and go back to making money the old fashioned way _meta_end_dot_
