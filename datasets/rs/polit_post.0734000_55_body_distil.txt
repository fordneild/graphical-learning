  regulation of the mortgage industry has suddenly become the cause du jour among the political class _meta_end_dot_

 far from it _meta_end_dot_

 these people should talk to their lenders many of whom are eager to help them with a solution _meta_end_dot_

 but the proposed bailout plans on both sides of the aisle have a whole host of problems attendant to them and market distortions are no way to address the subprime crisis _meta_end_dot_

 quite the contrary they would only serve to make a bad situation far far worse _meta_end_dot_
