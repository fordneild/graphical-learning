  how else to explain this departure from accepted reality _meta_end_question_

 i m sorry but there are times even today where i just have to stop for a second and recognize the implications of phrases like that _meta_end_dot_

 the monster of my childhood is dead _meta_end_dot_

 we killed it _meta_end_dot_

 and we broke it first before we killed it _meta_end_dot_

 right _meta_end_dot_

 moving on why them by the way _meta_end_question_

 because the czechs and the poles know that no matter what happens we are never ever ever going to install a governor general in either prague or warsaw _meta_end_dot_

 this makes us a refreshing change of pace in their point of view from mostly every other hegemon in history not to mention most of their neighbors _meta_end_dot_

 pause why of course like hot air i m going to remind people of senator obama s oopsie along these lines after all it s not my fault that the democrats are seriously considering nominating a natsec illiterate for the presidency _meta_end_dot_

 moe lane ps anyone feel like betting that obama won t be equally regretting the second half of that video before too much longer too _meta_end_question_
