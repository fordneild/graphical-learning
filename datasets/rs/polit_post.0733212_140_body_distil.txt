  in the slow pace of the senate the wheels are already moving to replace trent lott and we could see a win for conservatives _meta_end_dot_

 as it appears right now john kyl will become the minority whip _meta_end_dot_

 kay bailey hutchinson will kill off challenges by both messrs _meta_end_dot_

 burr and alexander to be conference chairman if she decides to run _meta_end_dot_

 she s still making calls and weighing options _meta_end_dot_

 if kbh does run then john cornyn will ascend to the policy committee _meta_end_dot_

 i expect jeff sessions to run and get elected as vice chairman of the policy committee conference _meta_end_dot_

 cornyn will be a much better policy chair than kbh who has excluded staffers from meetings who she deemed were too far to the right from her _meta_end_dot_

 she won t be conference chairman for long since she s going to run for governor in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 the irony in all of this is that the fate of conservatives in the senate rests with kay bailey hutchinson _meta_end_dot_

 we actually should support her _meta_end_dot_

 while incremental let s toy with this playing out after _meta_number_ref_ mcconnell either wins or loses if he loses john kyl will probably become minority leader moving up from whip if mcconnell wins he might still face a coup if the gop senate conference feels the need to go in a new more conservative direction after a disastrous _meta_number_ref_ election cycle _meta_end_dot_

 if the gop does get slaughtered at the polls it will likely be moderate senators bearing the brunt of the voters anger making the remaining gop caucus more conservative and more willing to vote their own into leadership _meta_end_dot_

 so kyl might take the reins then too _meta_end_dot_

 with kyl as leader cornyn will run for whip with a reduced number of republican senators but a more conservative group _meta_end_dot_

 sessions will get to policy which is what he wants and that leaves demint available to be the party s message guy in conference chair _meta_end_dot_

 that ll leave open a slot as vp for conference which a good conservative could fill _meta_end_dot_

 imagine post _meta_number_ref_ having the top senate republicans be in order kyl cornyn demint sessions and an as yet to be determined conservative _meta_end_dot_

 one note just so i don t get accused of anything i don t mean i m not hoping that the gop gets wiped out in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 i hope in fact that it doesn t _meta_end_dot_

 but i can see the writing on the wall _meta_end_dot_

 and sometimes it takes hitting rock bottom for addicts to want recovery especially when they re addicted to earmarks _meta_end_dot_

 let s just pray to god that if we do get slaughtered that we don t fall under _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 lott s leadership race looks like it will happen december _meta_number_ref_th _meta_end_dot_
