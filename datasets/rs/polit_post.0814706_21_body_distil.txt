  it is good to see that despite barack obama s claim to be above it all when it comes to politics and the various quasi sordid things that are part and parcel of having a life in politics news reports are calling him on his purer than thou rhetoric indeed it is na ve to think that politicians especially those who have risen to enough prominence to be able to run for the presidency of the united states will not have lobbying connections _meta_end_dot_

 and it is more than a little bit silly to base one s vote for the presidency on the amount of lobbying connections or purported lack thereof that a particular candidate has _meta_end_dot_

 still if the obama campaign wants to portray itself as having clean hands when it comes to lobbying connections i won t object too loudly when the media points out that in fact it doesn t _meta_end_dot_
