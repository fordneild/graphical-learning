  ok the entire use of the gate suffix for every potential political scandal has officially jumped the shark _meta_end_dot_

 there are people voting who weren t born when the break in occurred time to find another cliche _meta_end_dot_

 moving on remember that tip that tom brokaw got about the _meta_number_ref_ super delegates that were supposed to jump from clinton to obama _meta_end_question_

 now we have somebody with a name repeating that i say somebody with a name because somebody from the obama campaign without one claimed that the story was wrong _meta_end_dot_

 i could do commentary but it d all boil down to this so i ll just note that i look forward to hearing the names and move on my merry way _meta_end_dot_
