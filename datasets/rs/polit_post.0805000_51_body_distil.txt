  the movie oh brother where art thou which pits pappy o daniel against homer stokes for governor gives an interesting backdrop for what the democrats would have you believe about american culture and the upcoming election s in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 afraid to actually assume responsibility for a racial divide originally concocted by democrats to assuage minorities and convince them of some weird imperative that democrats need to rule the us we all should take a moment to recognize that it s the left that wants you to believe the right is the cause of all the ills the minorities in this country have been begged to suffer _meta_end_dot_

 imagine for just a moment barack obama wearing the red cloak of the klan s imperial wizard by night only to appear by day to swear to represent the little people and insist on a change long overdue to all the citizens he presumes to represent _meta_end_dot_

 head exploding yet _meta_end_question_

 then consider that piece of human waste frank rich asking you to believe as much about the gop _meta_end_dot_

 how exciting it must be for the democrats these days two minority candidates running for president of the united states of america _meta_end_dot_

 what must be especially pleasing to women and blacks in this country is the fact that neither of these presumed poster children for minorities rising above their stigma candidates actually cares to really fight for the causes of these minority demographics from whence they have arisen satisfied in their presumption that their peeps will vote for them just because cometh an arts and leisure expert who fancies himself some sort of expert in american culture and its pretended affiliation with american politics to make sure we all understand that the gop is trapped in an archaic black and white newsreel and looks more like a nostalgic relic than a national political party in contemporary america according to this caricature of a thoughtful man frank rich the gop apparently finds itself drowning in i might otherwise have passed right on by this tripe but frank rich ticked off the wrong guy by referring to me and my ilk as the grand old white party and further begged my response by claiming some insightful expertise regarding race relations in america due to his having attended a then segregated woodrow wilson high school in nw washington dc while living in the far from poor cleveland park neighborhood which is very close to the zoo and the national cathedral and a host of other big name spots in old dc _meta_end_dot_

 rich also forgets to remind us that his father was president of rich s shoe stores down on f street as he was growing up and strikingly absent from mr _meta_end_dot_

 rich s race baiting trash was his reminiscence of his family s shoe store having been burned to the ground during the riots that followed mlk s assassination in april of _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 see mr _meta_end_dot_

 rich was already off to harvard when the death and destruction and all out war between whites and blacks commenced and i m fairly certain the dinner table chatter at the rich home was not about how much the gop had wronged the black man in this country _meta_end_dot_

 call it a lucky guess _meta_end_dot_

 while i may be nine years rich s junior i actually stayed for the mayhem that began in april of _meta_number_ref_ i was _meta_number_ref_ and the racial hell that carried on through my entire junior and senior high school life _meta_end_dot_

 see unlike mr _meta_end_dot_

 rich i was as a white kid in a white neighborhood bused to a black neighborhood starting in the fall of _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_th grade _meta_end_dot_

 i seem to remember an entirely different world than the one mr _meta_end_dot_

 rich glorifies and i lived only a handful of miles away just over the maryland border a simple enough bicycle ride back then through queenstown that would likely see me killed were i to try such a ride today _meta_end_dot_

 i m used to the nyt s journalistic malpractice but choosing to accompany mr _meta_end_dot_

 rich s piece with a confederate flag cartoon was the last straw _meta_end_dot_

 i m sick and tired of this racism sleight of hand from the democrats and the elitists who proclaim to know so much about life down in the mud of the streets and alleys in that school of hard knocks we regular folk graduated from and i m playing all the race cards below the fold _meta_end_dot_

 more _meta_end_dot_

 the confederate flag might be an outstanding mechanism for folks to look towards in reminding the younger generations of a time and place in american history where dumb redneck hicks from the south considered themselves god like or above the natural laws of things but what you never hear from these democrat demagogues is what the confederacy brought to america that has long since been lost in the short list of things that matter when it comes to being an american _meta_end_dot_

 as a down line confederate i know of a reverence for god a deep rooted respect for my elders a conviction that a government is only as good as the independent and strong willed people who fight for her and a belief that the federal government is best that governs states the least this being emblematic of a republic that was founded with the intention of ensuring as much for her citizens _meta_end_dot_

 what i also know is that anyone that believes such things today are considered racist or worse _meta_end_dot_

 look i am derived from confederates who often times found themselves indentured servants so it s not like there s any anti black mentality in my blood we had as much to lose as anyone else but we did appreciate the meaning and value of fighting for what what we believed in black white green yellow or anything in between the difference here is that the democrats want you to believe any who might question such platitudes now must therefore be deemed rednecks _meta_end_dot_

 my ancestors and yours are rolling in their graves _meta_end_dot_

 the confederate flag might have flown over some dark days of this republic but that s not to suggest that the ideals of the confederacy beyond the darkness of slavery should be lost in the translation _meta_end_dot_

 that flag flew to represent an america that stood up for a people and a belief that a federal government had no place in deciding the business of the states right to determine their futures _meta_end_dot_

 millions of dead later the ideals are unchanged do with that what you will _meta_end_dot_

 like with the democrats in general mr _meta_end_dot_

 rich seems only able to remember selectively whatever furthers his marginalizing of one party at the expense of the very people he presumes to be most capable of protecting and caring for by promising them as much from another party _meta_end_dot_

 and as with all the rest of the democrats he continues to refuse responsibility for having caused much of the troubles the black and hispanic and women minorities continue to struggle to overcome to this very day _meta_end_dot_

 this passage from rich s nyt piece sets the tone for any of us who were there for the _meta_number_ref_ s he remembers so fondly as he sat cozy up on campus at harvard yeah _meta_end_dot_

 frank i came of age in the _meta_number_ref_ s as i got beaten and robbed my friends got hospitalized and everywhere there were race riots and vandalism and fear amongst both blacks and whites about whether they would live to see the next day _meta_end_dot_

 so just how tough was it for you up there in cambridge mr _meta_end_dot_

 rich while your dc burned _meta_end_question_

 if i recall correctly the democrats were running the show all through the cultural transition from racism and prejudice and stereotype to forgiveness and reconciliation and respect and trust _meta_end_dot_

 how well did that work for us _meta_end_question_

 from what i see there is at best guarded trust wavering respect little forgiveness and clearly nearly no reconciliation _meta_end_dot_

 ask al sharpton about that maybe jesse jackson too _meta_end_dot_

 perhaps mr _meta_end_dot_

 rich can show us just exactly how the democrat party will do under either an obama or clinton administration to reconcile these shortcomings in race relations today _meta_end_dot_

 i ll not hold my breath _meta_end_dot_

 the fundamental problem with rich and his buds on the left is this ridiculous notion that giving stuff to minorities from the government will help them _meta_end_dot_

 unfortunately the only ones helped are the ones seeking votes and a retention of or ascension to power _meta_end_dot_

 the distinctions between the ideologies liberal and conservative are clear liberals will take from one and give to another _meta_end_dot_

 conservatives will help you along until you can provide sink or swim on your own _meta_end_dot_

 yet somehow the liberals continue to keep secret from their benefactors the extent to which they would further enslave all who become dependent on them _meta_end_dot_

 rich like so many of his misguided friends on the left once said and yet several years on he would have you not assuage america s minorities in the context of their skin color _meta_end_dot_

 who are we to believe _meta_end_question_

 those who would give you trinkets and morsels of happiness and independence _meta_end_question_

 or those who would slap you in the face with the reality of what it takes to be an independent thinking god fearing human being satisfied in the notion that you can become what you choose to become v _meta_end_dot_

 that which the government decides you are most capable of becoming _meta_end_question_

 hmmm do we really like this newfound pigment selectivism _meta_end_question_

 or are we all god s creatures complacent with his ideas of humanity _meta_end_question_
