  so we have this result of polling done to gauge whether more democrats want hillary clinton to drop out of the race _meta_end_dot_

 the result may surprise people _meta_number_ref_ percentage points _meta_end_question_

 the mind reels _meta_end_dot_

 nothing has happened since yesterday to change my belief that having hillary as a vice presidential nominee would be a catastrophically bad move for obama to make _meta_end_dot_

 given all of the negatives that hillary brings to the ticket the very few positives that she would bring to it and the fact that her comments yesterday have caused some to wonder whether she reads obituaries with avid interest to see whether a certain senator from illinois is listed amongst them it seems clear that hillary clinton and barack obama will not be the best of buddies on the fall campaign trail and that she will not bring all that much value to the ticket _meta_end_dot_

 yes i am aware of the argument that she might help obama unify the party after what has been and continues to be a tough and bloody contest _meta_end_dot_

 but if the democrats do not unify by themselves at the end of all of this in what is supposedly a tremendously promising democratic year then they will richly deserve to lose _meta_end_dot_

 and it shouldn t take hillary clinton to help bring about unity _meta_end_dot_

 still one cannot ignore the poll results indicating that more and more people want her to stay in through the end _meta_end_dot_

 and given the bad blood that has developed in the obama campaign any prospect that hillary clinton will continue to stay in the race will be an unwelcome one in the obama campaign _meta_end_dot_

 and that is where the opportunity for mischief referenced in the title comes in _meta_end_dot_

 most people seem to think that the vice presidential selection process begins and ends with the presidential nominee vetting candidates and making a decision _meta_end_dot_

 not so _meta_end_exclamation_

 a vice presidential nominee will be selected by the presumptive presidential nominee but for that candidate to become the nominee he or she will have to be approved by the roll call of the delegates at the convention just like the presidential nominee _meta_end_dot_

 and more than one candidate can be nominated for the vice presidency _meta_end_dot_

 you see where i am going with this _meta_end_question_

 if not read this _meta_end_dot_

 surely there has to be some way that republicans can engineer getting hillary clinton nominated at the democratic national convention as vice president _meta_end_dot_

 perhaps her husband can do it _meta_end_dot_

 perhaps joe lieberman who is not a superdelegate because of his support for senator john mccain but presumably will still be allowed in denver can do it _meta_end_dot_

 perhaps hillary can throw her own hat in the ring and force a vote even if obama chooses someone else _meta_end_dot_

 this is a can t lose situation for republicans _meta_end_dot_

 if hillary wins obama will be seen as unable to control his own convention an expression of weakness that will be fatal in the fall by itself _meta_end_dot_

 even if it isn t the continued questions over how well obama and hillary will be able to work together if they are elected will cause the campaign to be off message many more times than it isn t _meta_end_dot_

 and if hillary loses her supporters outrage will be refreshed and will stay fresh during the fall which may well serve to deprive obama of the votes that he will need to win what may very well be a close race _meta_end_dot_

 politics ain t beanbag and it is supposed to be fun _meta_end_dot_

 for republicans i can t imagine a more fun activity _meta_end_dot_

 given the bad blood that remains on the democratic side getting hillary clinton nominated for the vice presidency against barack obama s will will serve as a tremendously diverting activity _meta_end_dot_

 and it may well be easier than many people think _meta_end_dot_
