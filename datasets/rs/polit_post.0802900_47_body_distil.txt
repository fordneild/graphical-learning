  as regular readers know see here and here i continue to believe that rudy giuliani is the best potential president in the gop field and specifically the one most likely to accomplish conservative policy priorities and would be a strong candidate in the general election _meta_end_dot_

 that assessment which i won t rehash here is based in large part on rudy s personal characteristics temperament and accomplishments after all ideas don t run for president people do _meta_end_dot_

 of course rudy s record on social issues has long been the primary obstacle to winning the nomination and everyone who paid any attention whatsoever to rudy s record and to republican politics over the past few decades knew that _meta_end_dot_

 thus a rudy for president campaign needed to have a well thought out plan from day one as to how to deal with that obstacle _meta_end_dot_

 since the summer of _meta_number_ref_ i have been laying out in public and in private including to people who hoped at the time to have the ear of the giuliani camp my roadmap to how rudy could overcome this obstacle _meta_end_dot_

 i never thought he could win over everyone but i believed then and believe now that there was an opportunity had rudy played his cards the right way at the right time to take the goodwill and respect rudy enjoyed with socially conservative voters who respected him as a leader and offer a compromise that would keep enough pro lifers in particular on board to build a winning coalition in the primaries and hold enough of the party together and appeal to enough independent or swing voters to march to victory in november _meta_end_dot_

 rudy has followed some of the paths i laid out not that i take credit for this but he never gave the speech i thought would really make the difference _meta_end_dot_

 when voters go to the polls tomorrow in florida they may breathe new life into rudy s campaign or more likely they may end it _meta_end_dot_

 either way it s probably too late to give this speech and so i offer it to you dear readers and to posterity _meta_end_dot_

 read on _meta_end_dot_

 first the setup _meta_end_dot_

 a presidential candidate who wants to change the public s perception of him or her can t rely on position papers or even standing alone a speech or press conference what is needed is to create a news event _meta_end_dot_

 the ideal time to do this if the candidate is addressing a weakness rather than a strength is very early in the campaign before the media has crafted its narratives before officeholders have endorsed before opponents have launched their attack ads or in some cases even decided whether to get in the race before voters and donors and pundits have become emotionally committed to particular candidates _meta_end_dot_

 the news event s timing and choreography should be planned for maximum effect and be able to be summarized in pithy enough fashion to be embodied in the kind of shorthand talking point that can endure the game of telephone that is the media s and public s perception of candidates positions _meta_end_dot_

 an old fashioned way to do this was to give a particular set of positions a title in capital letters such as the square deal the new deal the new frontier the great society well actually this fell out of favor after the great society for good reason _meta_end_dot_

 compassionate conservatism is such a slogan and was effective in rebranding george w _meta_end_dot_

 bush for good and for ill as not newt gingrich _meta_end_dot_

 so my thought was a speech at or near the announcement of rudy s official campaign early in _meta_number_ref_ promoted in advance with much fanfare setting out his vision of the new federalism and proposing it as a break from the status quo in national politics _meta_end_dot_

 if presented in the right way such a speech could co opt both conservative themes and liberal media stereotypes in a way that could have created for rudy an enormous opportunity _meta_end_dot_

 here it goes ________________________________________________________ _______________________________________________________ my own sense is the media would really have had no choice but to eat this up and it would have upended the narrative of the _meta_number_ref_ primary campaign by presenting rudy of all people as the great peacemaker on social issues while staying true to his fundamental issue positions _meta_end_dot_

 we may never know _meta_end_dot_
