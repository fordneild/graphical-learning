  i just opined the other day that the word conservatism has been mis used and abused by all these political opportunists running for president and along comes a person the world does seem to listen to who suggests nearly the same thing _meta_end_dot_

 now this goldberg piece smells awfully pro huckabee but i ve been rightly accused of late of being overly sensitive to these matters i swear i m being channeled _meta_end_dot_

 among the gop potus wannabes i honestly believe each less one in my opinion _meta_end_dot_

 who i shall not name because this would then be considered a pimping essay espouse one or more policy positions that completely contradict the reagan conservatism some of us still pine for _meta_number_ref_ years on _meta_end_dot_

 and for those who are absolutely convinced that our political heroes are the root of all our collective evils read congress really sucks be reminded of this speech reagan s first inaugural and what he said then and whether the same might be said today more below the fold _meta_end_dot_

 sigh good times good times _meta_end_dot_

 if you believe in limited or focused at least government and you think like the founders you d ascribe to the unattributed quote rumor has it either jefferson or paine originated this now some might argue this is not necessarily copyrighted by the abstract conservatism we all seem to be bandying about but surely we can identify the candidates running for president from either side of the chasm who do and who do not hold to this ideal _meta_end_dot_

 goldberg continues jonah s right of course and he brings to light this notion that some new conservatism has arrived or has been percolating under _meta_number_ref_ years of a bush white house that seems hell bent on re writing that old time religion of reagan goldwater conservatism _meta_end_dot_

 some weird mutation seems to have occurred over the past _meta_number_ref_ years and it has happened so slowly as to feel somehow like a logical progression of some alternate reality world of continuous improvement _meta_end_dot_

 but it s increasingly antithetical to what we old schoolers still believe reflects intelligent democracy and self governance _meta_end_dot_

 sadly we old schoolers are being shut down and cast aside for the new conservatism _meta_end_dot_

 sorry folks it if it looks like liberalism smells like liberalism and feels like libneralism it must be liberalism _meta_end_dot_

 goldberg ends his piece thusly yes jonah do no harm would be a fair translation _meta_end_dot_

 yet all around us we see clamoring throngs of republicans and independents and so called swing voters screaming and rallying for their magazine cover candidate who looks good who can win and who stabs us ideologically in the back the least _meta_end_dot_

 it s beginning to feel like the only thing motivating what little gop activism we do enjoy is this innate desire to have been right on speculating which guy will get the nod to run against the liberals _meta_end_dot_

 pathetic really but it s what has become of the conservative ideals of a day and time having long since outlived its usefulness apparently _meta_end_dot_
