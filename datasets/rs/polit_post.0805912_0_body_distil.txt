  mike bloomberg the socially liberal and otherwise centrist democrat turned republican turned independent mayor of new york has announced in an op ed for tomorrow s ny times that he is not running for president sounds to me like he s probably more open to backing mccain who goes beyond rhetorical nods and has actually worked to buck his party s orthodoxy more than i or other conservative republicans would like obama may be a unity candidate in his rhetoric but few things are less descriptive of barack obama than practical solutions that challenge party orthodoxy read on _meta_end_dot_

 that impression is underlined by some of bloomberg s specific examples while there are shots there at both sides obama more than mccain is the candidate who seems lacking in understanding of these basics _meta_end_dot_

 now it s true that obama is less of a visibly hard edged partisan than hillary so just as with the rise of mccain on the gop side began puncturing bloomberg s case for arguing that the two sides were locked hopelessly in their partisan ruts it s not surprising to read this personally i never thought that bloomberg would wound mccain half as much as the democrats especially if the race is against obama rather than hillary who personally repulses a fair number of natural democrats who might otherwise cross to mccain so this isn t all that consequential news after all _meta_end_dot_

 and it s not like a bloomberg endorsement would carry much weight although in combination with schwarzenegger and joe liberman it would give mccain a real patina of reaching the middle _meta_end_dot_

 but the most important news here is simply that bloomberg s vast fortune won t be inserted into the race _meta_end_dot_
