  barack obama argues that his judgement is why he should be elected president _meta_end_dot_

 his whole campaign is predicated on a speech that he gave in october of _meta_number_ref_ in which he claims to have demonstrated that judgement _meta_end_dot_

 here s part of that speech he misspoke yesterday _meta_end_dot_

 instead it turns out that one of his stock lines is just false _meta_end_dot_

 and the speech in which obama claims to have demonstrated his judgement he instead demonstrated his ignorance _meta_end_dot_
