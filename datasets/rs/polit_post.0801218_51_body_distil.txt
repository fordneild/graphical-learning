  macomb county michigan is one of the homes of the reagan democrat _meta_end_dot_

 today i saw john mccain give a town hall in the closing stretch of the michigan primary _meta_end_dot_

 i don t have pictures because my video camera was stolen but i have impressions _meta_end_dot_

 michigan is in an a single state recession _meta_end_dot_

 unemployment is above _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 many of the current jobs are in manufacturing which the detroit news the conservative paper in the state has noted won t come back _meta_end_dot_

 how to handle this is the fundamental debate _meta_end_dot_

 mitt romney is saying that he personally can turn the state around and that the future of michigan is bright _meta_end_dot_

 mccain has argued that more realism and effort is needed and has focused on retraining programs _meta_end_dot_

 my gut is that mccain wins this fight by recognizing the challenges _meta_end_dot_

 in new hampshire exit polls mccain received substantially more support from people with economic anxiety and romney won only one economic subgroup those making between _meta_dollor_ref_k and _meta_dollor_ref_k _meta_end_dot_

 mccain s answer is a retraining program _meta_end_dot_

 in march i was in new hampshire before my camera was stolen and asked him a similar question _meta_end_dot_

 this was his answer mccain was asked about the subprime crisis and he passed the microphone to carli fiorina the ceo of hp formerly hewlett packard _meta_end_dot_

 she said that she had never campaigned before and was supporting mccain because he is a unique and inspiring leader she turned to answering the question and focused on the need for transparency and accountability _meta_end_dot_

 she said that there were many things off balance sheet so that risks couldn t be properly accounted for _meta_end_dot_

 she then invoked enron and said if you can t see it you can t understand it one person in the audience liked the answer enough to say thank you madame vice president off to an event at the americans for prosperity forum _meta_end_dot_
