  i don t care if you are the biggest obama hater out there you will think this video is cool _meta_end_dot_

 obama s yes we can speech in new hampshire was historically memorable _meta_end_dot_

 this video cements the inspiration found in his words _meta_end_dot_

 he may be full of hopeful air but if you take the speech in a more personal way it can certainly rustle something good in your heart _meta_end_dot_

 the video is not sponsored by obama but a collabaration of celebrities who support him singing the words to the yes we can speech _meta_end_dot_

 the song is released by will i am a black eyed peas singer and director jesse dylan son of bob dylan _meta_end_dot_

 the others featured in the video including scarlett johanson john legend kate walsh and kareem adbul jabbar among others sing the words to the speech as obama s voice is filtered through at the same time _meta_end_dot_

 the way they sync the words together is chilling _meta_end_dot_

 the ultra coolness of this video will likely persuade at least a few undecided non investigative type of voters to swing for obama _meta_end_dot_

 i hope we see something of equal awesomeness from republicans sometime soon _meta_end_dot_
