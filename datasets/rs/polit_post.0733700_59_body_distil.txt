  over the several months since the implementation of the surge and general david petraeus s accompanying counterinsurgency strategy the improving security situation in iraq has caught the attention of the american people _meta_end_dot_

 a rasmussen poll conducted at the end of november found that _meta_percent_ref_ of voters expect the situation in iraq to improve over the next six months the first time in years that a plurality has given a positive assessment on the situation in iraq while _meta_percent_ref_ of those surveyed still expect the situation to deteriorate the current numbers fueled by the success of gen _meta_end_dot_

 petraeus s strategy are a vast improvement over what they were just four months ago when only _meta_percent_ref_ of the american voting public expected the situation to improve over the next six months compared with _meta_percent_ref_ of the public predicting further deterioration _meta_end_dot_

 the public s long term view of america s undertaking in iraq though still not majority positive is improving as well _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_percent_ref_ now believe that the mission will ultimately be judged a success up from _meta_percent_ref_ in july while _meta_percent_ref_ still think that it will be considered a failure down from _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 one result of this shift in public opinion has been a move by some democrat politicians including some who have been fiercely and vocally opposed to the war for some time now to either back off of their public condemnations of the u s s effort in iraq or to change their tune outright on the situation there _meta_end_dot_

 the starkest example of this is representative jack murtha d pa who in a saul of tarsus moment last week contradicted every iraq related public statement that he has made for the last year including as recently as july when he told cnn that those who claimed that the surge which he called a failed policy wrapped in illusion was anything other than a complete failure was delusional to say the least by making the shocking admission that the surge is working according to the politico murtha s comments which coincided with the release of the rasmussen poll and with his return from a brief visit to baghdad during the thanksgiving recess came only days after he yelled at a reporter during a press conference telling the reporter that the news coming out of the pentagon regarding iraq is not believable pittsburgh post gazette reported that murtha said he was most encouraged by changes in the once volatile anbar province where locals have started working closely with u s _meta_end_dot_

 forces to isolate insurgents linked to al qaeda of course this admission and its accompanying reasoning comes a full four months after michael o hanlon and kenneth pollack two fellows at the left leaning brookings institution penned the now famous op ed in the new york times in which they acknowledged the growing improvements in iraq citing the turnaround in anbar province ongoing since fall of _meta_number_ref_ as a key factor in their assessment which echoed much of what i reported while in iraq myself this spring _meta_end_dot_

 though house majority leader steny hoyer d md attributed the change in public opinion to ignorance saying that it was a result of the fact that people are not as engaged daily with the reality of iraq other democrats like rep _meta_end_dot_

 norm dicks d wa have responded to the shift in the voters attitudes by dropping their defeatist rhetoric and concurring with murtha that the surge is working _meta_end_dot_

 given the timing of these statements with regard to the release of the latest poll on iraq and the looming specter of the _meta_number_ref_ elections it appears that some democrat members of congress having gotten all of the money and support that they could from the fringe dailykos code pink moveon org left and mindful of where their actual paychecks come from are attempting to tack back toward the center on the issue to ensure that their hometown voters remain satisfied _meta_end_dot_

 the politics of iraq are going to change dramatically in the general election assuming iraq continues to show some hopefulness o hanlon a clinton supporter in the democrat presidential primary told the new york times last week _meta_end_dot_

 murtha dicks and others appear to have recognized that and appear to be attempting to get out in front of the coming stampede to get on what could be the right side of this issue in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 thus far these latest converts on iraq have managed to escape the public castigation that accompanied the change of heart expressed by rep _meta_end_dot_

 however they have been privately chastised by more senior members of their majority party in congress which is struggling more and more to maintain the unified anti war and anti iraq success front that the party entered the _meta_number_ref_ th congress with _meta_end_dot_

 pelosi is going to be furious a democrat aide told the politico the day after murtha s comments _meta_end_dot_

 this could be a real headache for us since the beginning of the iraq war the democrat party has tied its success to their nation s failure _meta_end_dot_

 the continuing shift in public opinion on iraq combined with the improving conditions there could be a real headache indeed for the leaders of a party that deliberately put itself in the unenviable position of succeeding only as long as there continues to be bad news and public despair about and military failure in iraq _meta_end_dot_

 should the current trends continue congressional democrats may find themselves in a situation exactly opposite that which they expected and hoped to be in falling in the polls and failing at the ballot box while their nation succeeds _meta_end_dot_
