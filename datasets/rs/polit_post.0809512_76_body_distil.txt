  today in new york city a memorial service is being held to honor one of my heroes william f _meta_end_dot_

 buckley jr _meta_end_dot_

 in remembrance of this occasion i wanted to try and put down some of my thoughts about how this great man impacted my life _meta_end_dot_

 wfb to use the shorthand and i had little in common on the surface _meta_end_dot_

 he was a wealthy ivy league educated world traveler with roots in the south and east coast _meta_end_dot_

 i was born and raised in the midwest in a middle class family attended a small liberal arts college and my only foreign travel was a trip to france in grad school _meta_end_dot_

 he loved classical music and i barely know the difference between bach and beethoven _meta_end_dot_

 he loved to sail and sailed around the world _meta_end_dot_

 i have been a on a sail boat probably twice in my whole life _meta_end_dot_

 he was a master of the english language _meta_end_dot_

 i struggled with dyslexia as a child and still struggle with spelling and grammar _meta_end_dot_

 he was a lifelong catholic and i am an evangelical protestant who grew up in small bible churches _meta_end_dot_

 in short he was a sophisticated highly intelligent famous and impactful person _meta_end_dot_

 i am not _meta_end_dot_

 but it was his greatness his goodness his fundamental rightness that called me to strive to be better to know more to communicate better to make an impact _meta_end_dot_

 for more keep reading _meta_end_dot_

 my conservatism growing up was amorphous and undeveloped _meta_end_dot_

 it was instinctual rather than intellectual _meta_end_dot_

 but like so many others that changed when i started reading national review in high school _meta_end_dot_

 it was through the magazine that buckley founded and led for so many years that i first began to wrestle with the intellectual and political challenges of the day _meta_end_dot_

 it was through nr that i realized that i cared about politics and that it had an impact on our lives _meta_end_dot_

 it was through nr that i began to understand the philosophical and intellectual underpinnings the reasons why of my in many ways innate conservatism _meta_end_dot_

 i was soon engaging anyone who would listen with my newfound knowledge _meta_end_dot_

 i tried to bring the wit and wisdom of wfb to these engagements but i am sure i never came close _meta_end_dot_

 nevertheless i must have made some impression because my history teacher started calling me a buckleyite i am sure he meant it in a slightly derogatory way but i wore the label with honor _meta_end_dot_

 in college and graduate school i deepened these roots _meta_end_dot_

 i started my buckley book collection and soon had read every stand alone book he had written not counting the collections of his columns _meta_end_dot_

 i discovered other great conservative writes like russell kirk whitaker chambers frank meyer and more _meta_end_dot_

 i wrote my graduate thesis on a man who had a great impact on buckley himself james burnham _meta_end_dot_

 i even corresponded with buckley for a short time _meta_end_dot_

 to me he was the symbol of what it meant to be a conservative _meta_end_dot_

 i wanted to be like bill _meta_end_dot_

 but it wasn t just in the area of ideas and arguments that buckley inspired _meta_end_dot_

 what amazed me about the man was his determination and ability to succeed at whatever task he set for himself _meta_end_dot_

 whether writing a bestselling book founding a magazine building the institutions of the conservative movement or sailing across the oceans playing the harpsichord or hosting a public affairs tv show _meta_end_dot_

 if he did something then he did it with all of his considerable skills _meta_end_dot_

 and it wasn t just worldly success that mattered to buckley _meta_end_dot_

 he was a man of deep faith _meta_end_dot_

 if there was a constant in his life it was his catholic faith _meta_end_dot_

 and he lived out this faith in countless ways throughout his life as many can attest _meta_end_dot_

 to have a man of such accomplishment intelligence wit and drive remain devoted and unashamed of his faith meant a lot to me _meta_end_dot_

 and his passing has taught me that he was also a great friend _meta_end_dot_

 nearly everyone who knew him noted that friendship was his great gift _meta_end_dot_

 those who agreed with him politically and those that were on opposite sides all found him to be a man who took friendship seriously who reached out and touched his friends in a myriad of ways _meta_end_dot_

 i count myself lucky to consider some of the folks who work for national review friends _meta_end_dot_

 it was a dream come true for me to be able to write for national review online _meta_end_dot_

 when i had a book review published in the magazine itself i felt like i had finally crossed something off my things to do before i die list _meta_end_dot_

 it meant in some small way i was connected with buckley and his legacy _meta_end_dot_

 the one time i met bill i was nearly speechless and i am sure i stumbled and stuttered as i attempted to communicate the impact he had on my life _meta_end_dot_

 but he was gracious and kind _meta_end_dot_

 he remembered the books i had sent him and thanked me again for the gift _meta_end_dot_

 the contrast seemed embarrassing to me _meta_end_dot_

 he had changed the world and i had sent him a set of famous speeches _meta_end_dot_

 but perhaps he grasped the thoughts that motivated the gift and was truly grateful _meta_end_dot_

 prior to today i have tried to write about buckley and his passing on many occasions but i never felt like my words matched the feelings the reality of his impact _meta_end_dot_

 but today i felt i could no longer be silent that i need to say something no matter how inadequate or unoriginal _meta_end_dot_

 william f _meta_end_dot_

 buckley was a hero of mine _meta_end_dot_

 he taught me to strive for great things to fight passionately for what we love to not take myself too seriously to hold steadfastly to my faith to cherish my friendships and be quick to make new ones _meta_end_dot_

 it seems to me that accepting mediocrity is in many ways the danger of american life _meta_end_dot_

 buckley taught me to rise above this temptation _meta_end_dot_

 to the degree that i have done so he deserves much of the credit _meta_end_dot_
