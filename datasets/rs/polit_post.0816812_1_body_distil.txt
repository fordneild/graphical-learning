  that democratic presidential nomination contest must have been more damaging than i thought it would be _meta_end_dot_

 i had figured that once matters cam to an end the democrats would rally fairly quickly around barack obama and that given the problems with the republican brand independent would flock to the obama campaign as well _meta_end_dot_

 maybe not likely voters instead of merely registered ones _meta_end_dot_
