  this is actually not something i m generally inclined to write _meta_end_dot_

 i m trying to get beyond writing things that might be construed as negative about republican candidates _meta_end_dot_

 but we had hugh the other day suggest that fred should not have gotten the nrlc endorsement because he did not support the hla and though not directly stating so fairly well implied that romney did _meta_end_dot_

 in fact of course romney has in the past said he supported the hla _meta_end_dot_

 but then he contradicted himself _meta_end_dot_

 nonetheless after i posted the other day that fred and mitt held the same position i got several emails suggesting that they did not because in fact mitt does support passage of the hla _meta_end_dot_

 kathryn lopez sums it up best _meta_end_dot_

 frankly i think fred and mitt hold the best position on this _meta_end_dot_

 the hla is a worthy goal but it s unrealistic to expect a president to invest major political capital in getting it passed when it won t get passed _meta_end_dot_

 the president can accomplish his goals in a host of other ways _meta_end_dot_

 the problem of course is that fred took heat for being very direct that he himself would not push the hla _meta_end_dot_

 romney on the other hand tried to be nuanced _meta_end_dot_
