  here is another in my series of good ideas we should steal from liberals _meta_end_dot_

 this one has to do with mccain feingold _meta_end_dot_

 or rather the lack of it _meta_end_dot_

 according to the associated press _meta_end_dot_

 at first glance this sounds like a dumb idea _meta_end_dot_

 but maybe it s not _meta_end_dot_

 maybe it s a mccain feingold idea _meta_end_dot_

 george bush is not a candidate for any federal office _meta_end_dot_

 this means that americans united for change can spend infinite money trashing him and they don t even have to report their donors to the fec _meta_end_dot_

 what s more there is inevitably going to be a certain erm latitude concerning what constitutes criticism of bush and what constitutes criticism of republican policies in general _meta_end_dot_

 which reminds me _meta_end_dot_

 and frankly it ought to remind t _meta_end_dot_

 boone pickens as well _meta_end_dot_

 in spite of the way former president clinton is comporting himself bill clinton is not a candidate for any federal office _meta_end_dot_
