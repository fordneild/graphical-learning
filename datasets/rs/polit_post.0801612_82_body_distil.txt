  wire story here _meta_end_dot_

 i ll let you digest the headline for yourself _meta_end_dot_

 the key point from the labor department is that consumer prices rose _meta_number_ref_ _meta_percent_ref_ in _meta_number_ref_ against _meta_number_ref_ _meta_percent_ref_ in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 essentially all of the increase is from sharply higher food and energy prices _meta_end_dot_

 in the meantime the fed reports that industrial output was flat in december after falling in october and rising less than expected in november _meta_end_dot_

 you probably remember how surprisingly good the third quarter gdp number looked at an annualized _meta_number_ref_ _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 something tells me that gdp for all of _meta_number_ref_ will ahem not be as good looking _meta_end_dot_

 the fed excludes food and energy prices from its preferred inflation measure called core inflation _meta_end_dot_

 when we get a reading on both _meta_number_ref_ gdp and core inflation we ll have some idea of the real as opposed to the nominal performance of the economy _meta_end_dot_

 it too is unlikely to look good _meta_end_dot_

 from a policy perspective the measurement of wage increases is the key takeaway from this whole batch of reports _meta_end_dot_

 real inflation adjusted wages fell _meta_number_ref_ _meta_percent_ref_ during _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 that sounds awful but there s a silver lining _meta_end_dot_

 it proves that the inflationary pressure coming from food and energy prices is not feeding through to labor costs and being passed along as higher prices for finished goods _meta_end_dot_

 why does that matter _meta_end_question_

 because the latter kind of inflation is exacerbated by monetary easing _meta_end_dot_

 as long as labor costs remain under control the federal reserve has more freedom to combat the economic slowdown with lower short term interest rates _meta_end_dot_

 sorry i don t have time for a longer analysis _meta_end_dot_

 feel free to have at it in the comments _meta_end_dot_
