  i happen to think that waterboarding should not be used as an interrogation device for many of the reasons listed here _meta_end_dot_

 even if we put aside any and all moral objections to the practice when you have an interrogation technique that induces hysterics on the board you have an unreliable interrogation technique _meta_end_dot_

 after all how much would you trust information from someone who has gone into hysterics especially with the national security of the united states on the line _meta_end_question_

 so i can certainly understand why the issue of waterboarding causes people to be passionate in their arguments and advocacy _meta_end_dot_

 what i cannot understand however is how the same people who denounce waterboarding once were utterly and completely silent about the moral qualms that they may have had and indeed showed few moral qualms when they were briefed on the issue _meta_end_dot_

 read on _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 so this is all very interesting indeed _meta_end_dot_

 and it now begs the question who amongst those now denouncing the administration for allegedly using waterboarding as an interrogation technique was demonstrating outright support for the technique back when they were first briefed about the issue _meta_end_question_

 oh the story says that at the time of the briefing there was deep concern about another imminent terrorist attack but the bush administration was at least equally concerned and no one has given them a free pass on the issue of torture despite the existence of that concern _meta_end_dot_

 and while notes may not have been taken the briefings were described as detailed and graphic so one pretty much had to be a vegetable not to understand what was going on _meta_end_dot_

 even if the briefings were vague on the specifics of waterboarding all of the reporting on the issue after the fact should have prompted at least a few of these latter day critics of the practice to come out admit that they were briefed on the issue back in _meta_number_ref_ and say something along the lines of at the time i didn t have a full awareness of what waterboarding was now i do i m appalled blah blah blah thus far we haven t even gotten that and if we do it will only be because this story has now come out _meta_end_dot_

 and of course many of the democrats who had been briefed on the issue of waterboarding and who showed outright support for the practice were the same ones who not only castigated the administration for its alleged use of the practice and who demanded that michael mukasey render a quasi legal decision during his confirmation hearings on the acceptability of waterboarding _meta_end_dot_

 the mind reels _meta_end_dot_

 we have the following weak tea from the office of speaker nancy pelosi any controversial policy i have come across in a long time _meta_end_dot_

 just what was pelosi thinking _meta_end_question_

 did she believe that it was okay to remain silent simply because waterboarding allegedly had not been practiced at the time _meta_end_question_

 and again now that waterboarding has allegedly been practiced why hasn t pelosi come out with an admission that she was briefed on the issue and a mea culpa stating that she should have objected to the practice at the time _meta_end_question_

 consistency is the hobgoblin of small minds to be sure but that doesn t mean that consistency is never a virtue _meta_end_dot_

 and then we have this from the former ranking democrat on the house intelligence committee jane harman anyone _meta_end_question_

 bueller _meta_end_question_

 bueller _meta_end_question_

 say this for john mccain _meta_end_dot_

 at least he understands when consistency might be a virtue and his sense of virtue _meta_end_dot_

 as for the rest of the people discussed in the story meh _meta_end_dot_

 the next time they say anything about the issue of waterboarding this story should come up and they should be made to answer certain questions _meta_end_dot_

 they got some splainin to do _meta_end_dot_
