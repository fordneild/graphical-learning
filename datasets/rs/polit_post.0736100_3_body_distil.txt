  i mean just because the fec is about to grind to a halt because senator barack obama has objected to one of bush s picks with the result that the gop has decided to follow suit in blocking the democratic nominees which means that there won t be a quorum starting january _meta_number_ref_ which means that candidates looking for federal matching funds may find themselves increasingly strapped for cash which includes former senator john edwards which means that obama who is not accepting federal matching funds has found himself somehow in the situation where his most important rival for the anti hillary democratic vote is facing a long slow financial strangulation _meta_end_dot_

 what an amusingly serendipitous coincidence _meta_end_exclamation_

 read on _meta_end_dot_

 we tend to forget that while senator obama has almost no national experience in politics he has cemented his relationship with the illinois democratic party it would be cruel of me to say that he has been successfully co opted by the illinois democratic party _meta_end_dot_

 this won t magically give him campaigning ability but has it taught him a trick or two about how to manage one s primary political opposition _meta_end_question_

 it s an interesting question if one that we are unlikely to have asked until he stops being the official fresh faced outsider who is shaking up the race and engaging ordinary people for _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 i do know that if a republican senator had found himself in a situation where his stance on a particular nomination just happened to negatively impact his immediate primary rival we wouldn t be able to move for all the accusations of rovian plots but that s just my vrwc cynicism talking no doubt _meta_end_dot_

 still if he has set things up this way i must admit to being at least slightly impressed _meta_end_dot_

 it s precisely the sort of outstretched foot in one s path that the old daley machine would have delighted in _meta_end_dot_
