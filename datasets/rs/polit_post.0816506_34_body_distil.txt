  it isn t as if i have my head in the sand or anything _meta_end_dot_

 i know that it is an uphill struggle for republicans nowadays and that the political situation for democrats is quite favorable _meta_end_dot_

 all indications are that barack obama will win the presidency and if he does i would not be surprised in the slightest _meta_end_dot_

 which is why i am surprised by this registered voters _meta_end_dot_

 likely voters may cut the lead even further and show mccain in a stronger position yet _meta_end_dot_

 i am in no position whatsoever to say for certain that john mccain will win this election _meta_end_dot_

 but distressingly enough for the obama campaign he certainly seems to be hanging in there doesn t he _meta_end_question_
