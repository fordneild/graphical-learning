  when we started redstate in may of _meta_number_ref_ we used a website program called scoop the same program a lot of similar sites on the left used _meta_end_dot_

 but as the number of visitors to our site grew scoop kept crashing on us _meta_end_dot_

 if we d been a liberal website we would have been able to fix the problem quickly and relatively cheaply _meta_end_dot_

 the online left loves scoop _meta_end_dot_

 unfortunately there weren t really any conservative scoop developers out there to help us _meta_end_dot_

 we kept crashing and were out of money _meta_end_dot_

 we had to close down or take drastic action _meta_end_dot_

 well we didn t close down _meta_end_dot_

 we ditched scoop and moved to the best alternative at the time a program called drupal _meta_end_dot_

 but in accomplishing the switch budget constraints forced us to sacrifice some popular site features in order to alleviate the strain on our overused servers _meta_end_dot_

 needless to say we always regarded those downgrades as temporary and we hoped to restore the eliminated features and to add new and even better ones as soon as we could afford to _meta_end_dot_

 unfortunately we still can t afford to _meta_end_dot_

 but we re convinced that america can afford even less to have us operating at anything less than our absolute peak potential during the coming presidential election season _meta_end_dot_

 so we ve decided to move ahead with our upgrades without delay and despite not having the cash on hand hoping and praying that redstate com readers like you will help us make up the shortfall with a generous donation _meta_end_dot_

 please read on for a preview and more begging _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 here specifically is what we re planning to accomplish with your generous financial support in february we will be launching redstate v _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ a complete website overhaul that instead of relying on third party providers like scoop or dupral will this time be our own specially created platform designed to give us all the capabilities power and independence to serve you our readers with everything you want and deserve _meta_end_dot_

 here are just a few of the features that we ll be adding to our website or bringing back by popular demand upgrades and improvements like these will immeasurably enhance the redstate com experience for you and other readers and help to attract new readers and thereby extend our influence during this crucial election season _meta_end_dot_

 but the v _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ upgrade will not come cheap _meta_end_dot_

 and to make it happen we need to raise an additional _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ over and above what we have available in our budget _meta_end_dot_

 and that s where loyal readers like you come in _meta_end_dot_

 we figure if just _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ of our readers respond to this appeal by donating at least _meta_dollor_ref_ each we can cover the entire shortfall in one fell swoop _meta_end_dot_

 won t you please help us out by making a donation today _meta_end_question_

 and please be as generous as you can afford much as i hope that we ll get _meta_number_ref_ donations that may be too hopeful on my part so your additional generosity will help compensate for those who can t even afford _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 and if at all possible please make your donation immediately by clicking here _meta_end_dot_

 we re already financially committed to this upgrade and the bills for it are already coming due _meta_end_dot_

 i ll be blunt i hate asking you for money _meta_end_dot_

 but i hate even more to imagine what america will be like if someone like hillary clinton or barack hussein obama wins the presidency in november _meta_end_dot_

 redstate can help prevent that nightmare from coming true but only if we re offering the best possible web experience to the widest possible audience _meta_end_dot_

 that s what redstate _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ will enable to us to become _meta_end_dot_

 please help make us the website that you ve been asking for that all our readers deserve and that america so desperately needs _meta_end_dot_
