  barack obama via his campaign flunkies sent out the following email with the subject line my response to bush after tonight s sotu _meta_number_ref_ the man knows his audience _meta_end_dot_

 they don t want to hear gwb called president bush after all he s illegitimate a nazi a far right uncompromising b_meta_beep_ref_rd and so many other things _meta_end_dot_

 given this obama is making a very calculated insult by simply calling the president bush in the subject line of his email though i suppose we should actually be applauding him for not pulling an msnbc and titling it my response to the monkey _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ clearly mr _meta_end_dot_

 obama doesn t know and of course his devout followers are unaware that state of the union addresses aren t given by newly inaugurated executives _meta_end_dot_

 a new president doesn t go before a joint session of congress and report on the state of the union as he inherited it otherwise nearly every four or eight years we d get a sotu dedicated to describing our country as being in a shambles on the brink of depression and in its death throes _meta_end_dot_

 addresses can be given to joint sessions but in an inaugural year sotu addresses are not _meta_end_dot_

 therefore contrary to his own written promise obama s first prospective sotu would not be next year but would be in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 but hey who cares about details _meta_end_question_

 they so get in the way of a good hate fueled campaign _meta_end_dot_

 h t tbone _meta_end_dot_
