  now i wasn t at redstate when the whole card check debate was going on but needless to say redstate was right and the democrats were wrong _meta_end_dot_

 what is so funny today is that the hillary clinton people after getting beaten trying to reduce the power of the culinary union are screaming about union intimidation _meta_end_dot_

 one diarist over at mydd captured the problem like this i love watching the democrats _meta_end_dot_

 they are validating our arguments about the democrat party _meta_end_dot_

 they prove the deep strain of racism in their party _meta_end_dot_

 they prove our arguments about union thuggery _meta_end_dot_

 they have a couple more weeks to give us more attacks _meta_end_dot_

 fun fun fun _meta_end_dot_
