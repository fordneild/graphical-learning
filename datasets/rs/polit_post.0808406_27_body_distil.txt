  in what is a full time effort on a number of fronts patterico corrects the l a _meta_end_dot_

 times on what precisely it is that the bush administration has said concerning a relationship between saddam hussein and al qaeda _meta_end_dot_

 you know this entire controversy would come to a dead bang halt if people just came to grips with the fact that the _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ commission confirmed the existence of a collaborative relationship between saddam hussein s regime and al qaeda _meta_end_dot_

 that doesn t mean that saddam was behind the _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ attacks _meta_end_dot_

 but what the _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ commission said should not be so casually dismissed either _meta_end_dot_

 but of course we don t live in a perfect world _meta_end_dot_

 and thus some basic commonsense guidelines get tossed to the side _meta_end_dot_

 leading the charge unfortunately are outlets like the l a _meta_end_dot_

 times which owe their readership better and which never seem to want to deliver _meta_end_dot_
