  john mccain invited several people to his ranch in sedona new mexico arizona this weekend _meta_end_dot_

 there were old primary opponents like mike huckabee sam brownback and mitt romney _meta_end_dot_

 there were some prominent republican governors like bobby jindal and charlie crist _meta_end_dot_

 fedex ceo fred smith was there _meta_end_dot_

 lindsay graham of course made it as was joe lieberman _meta_end_dot_

 former ebay boss meg whitman was there _meta_end_dot_

 and mccain advisor charlie black _meta_end_dot_

 and there were others _meta_end_dot_

 the nation s political press decided that this was a tryout for mccain s veep spot while lindsay graham appearing on cbs face the nation told host bob schieffer that his best senate buddy was just showing off his ranch and its _meta_number_ref_ species of birds _meta_end_dot_

 note i here use press as a generic term for the media there have been other recent get togethers at the mccain ranch including a recent one with minnesota tim pawlenty mel martinez trent lott and utah governor jon hunstman _meta_end_dot_

 that was in early march with little press coverage martinez cannot be veep as he was born in cuba _meta_end_dot_

 my two bits this memorial day after my solemn embrace of the memory of those who gave everything to preserve our ongoing republican small r experiment is that this mccain event strikes me as a cute sort of trick _meta_end_dot_

 we re not going to have any better idea of who is and who is not on the any list based on any guest list to a sleepover in late may _meta_end_dot_

 i like fred smith but he has a day job i think utah s huntsman a mormon mccain supporter would make a fine veep but is he out of consideration because he was invited to the wrong meeting _meta_end_question_

 after all he agrees with mccain and most of the rest of the media saturated nation on agw i d like to think again that this was a trick _meta_end_dot_

 read on let us say that mccain s peeps wanted attention from the political press _meta_end_dot_

 why not _meta_end_question_

 it s been all barry _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ for the past month _meta_end_dot_

 yeah hillary breaks in now and again with that monotonous blood curdling whine of hers an event like this will do it and politicians with day jobs jindal crist brownback graham will show up because mccain s the nominee of their party and that s just what one does for the nominee _meta_end_dot_

 plus how often does one have the opportunity to see so many species of birds _meta_end_question_

 now i included lindsey graham amongst those who will show up just because mccain s the nominee of their party that s not entirely accurate as lindsey has attached himself to arizona s senior senator almost since setting foot in the august body plus bobby byrd _meta_end_dot_

 they ve been inseparable _meta_end_dot_

 i d use the expression mini me but it s both not entirely accurate and dated by the bye i do not want to select john mccain s veep _meta_end_dot_

 i do not know who it will be _meta_end_dot_

 every one of the names listed by anyone is unacceptable to some group of republicans the gop is not what it was in _meta_number_ref_ when ronald reagan could tab the nominating contests runner up the squishy moderate george h w _meta_end_dot_

 bush _meta_end_dot_

 mccain s runner up was mike huckabee and there would be some noisy dissent amongst some activists _meta_end_dot_

 in fact every candidate who ran against mccain has three strikes against them going in and not because they opposed mccain _meta_end_dot_

 if john mccain were to invite me to a bbq in sedona though i d play it up big time _meta_end_dot_

 i d hold a press conference and say basically nothing in plenty of words just to see the political press come up with some sort of conventional wisdom about nothing in plenty of words _meta_end_dot_

 i d hire a publicist and queue for the cover of one of the weekly infotainment glossies like newsweek or time _meta_end_dot_

 yeah this is fun while it lasts but don t let it allow you to forget the sacrifices made to enable us to engage in our trifling banter _meta_end_dot_

 it may seem like a huge price for so little of merit but freedom is never meaningless or inexpensive when there are those who d like to lop off its head _meta_end_dot_
