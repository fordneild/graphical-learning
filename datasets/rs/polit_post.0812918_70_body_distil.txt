  senator chuck grassley is apparently not a big fan of those who preach some variant of the prosperity gospel in fact this form of ministry troubles grassley so much that this past winter he decided to use his considerable power as the former chairman and now ranking member on the senate finance committee to launch a full blown investigation into the operational affairs of six prosperity gospel ministries without walls international church world healing center church inc benny hinn ministries joyce meyer ministries world changers church international kenneth copeland ministries and new birth missionary baptist church _meta_end_dot_

 please continue reading below the fold come again _meta_end_question_

 this is the basis of grassley s investigation _meta_end_question_

 recent articles and news reports _meta_end_question_

 which ones _meta_end_question_

 where are the allegations of wrongdoing _meta_end_question_

 what have these ministries done to warrant such scrutiny from grassley and the senate finance committee _meta_end_question_

 if there really is evidence of serious wrongdoing then why isn t the irs leading the charge against these ministries _meta_end_question_

 look i understand how grassley and many folks feel about prosperity gospel ministries _meta_end_dot_

 lord knows it s not my cup of tea _meta_end_dot_

 indeed i use to subscribe to the wittenburg door for the sole purpose of reading its blistering and hilarious critiques of such ministries _meta_end_dot_

 nevertheless i find senator grassley s investigation of these ministries deeply troubling _meta_end_dot_

 at no time has grassley specified the reported allegations of wrongdoing nor their sources _meta_end_dot_

 so how in the world are these ministries supposed to address vague unsubstantiated allegations of wrongdoing _meta_end_question_

 grassley s letter to the ministries simply states that there are unspecified articles and reports floating around regarding the possible misuse of donations are you freaking kidding me _meta_end_question_

 this smells like a witch hunt to me plain and simple _meta_end_dot_

 indeed on the day the documents grassley requested were due he issued a press release that noted among other things pay special attention to the fourth sentence _meta_end_dot_

 there s absolutely no evidence that any of the ministries are not abid ing by tax laws shouldn t senator grassley have to set forth a concrete basis for investigating these ministries _meta_end_question_

 or is he simply allowed to sully their reputations on a whim _meta_end_question_

 so where do things stand to date _meta_end_question_

 at least three of the ministries are understandably refusing to cooperate or continue cooperating with the senate finance committee s investigation _meta_end_dot_

 kenneth copeland ministries which actually complied with the original deadline for producing the requested documents has decided to up the stakes with grassley by inviting the irs to undertake a full audit of its operations _meta_end_dot_

 the remaining two ministries have apparently placated the good senator for the time being _meta_end_dot_

 but the question still remains _meta_end_question_

 what ails grassley _meta_end_question_

 why is he targeting these ministries _meta_end_question_

 perhaps senator grassley has information that he isn t sharing but if the point of this investigation is the inform the public of wrongdoing then lay out the evidence for all to see including those being investigated _meta_end_dot_

 allow these ministries to defend themselves against charges allegedly based on presentations of material from watchdog groups and whistleblowers and on investigative reports in local media outlet in the absence of such evidence one is left to wonder whether senator grassley s investigation is motivated by religious bigotry rather than a genuine concern for the public welfare _meta_end_dot_

 as david boaz noted in a recent op ed for the dallas morning news finally this past friday the coalitions for america sent the following letter the senate finance committee expressing its concerns about the investigation of these ministries i could not agree more with the foregoing sentiments _meta_end_dot_

 senator grassley s investigation is disturbing on many levels but especially with regard to the chilling effect it could possibly have on religious speech and free exercise of religion in this country _meta_end_dot_

 now i am not saying senator grassley is a religious bigot mind you _meta_end_dot_

 but there are news reports and articles floating around on the ol world wide web suggesting that might indeed be the case _meta_end_dot_

 and until the good senator provides me with complete access to all of his professional and personal papers i have no choice but to assume that he is one _meta_end_dot_

 i look forward to receiving your timely response to my inquiry senator _meta_end_dot_
