  they re on there way to denver and hillary informs is that she s gonna fly now _meta_end_dot_

 from the associated press in philadelphia pa it s a movie hillary _meta_end_dot_

 if rocky had quit running up those stairs the audience would have muttered and tossed jujubes at the screen _meta_end_dot_

 if you were to withdraw now read on if hillary were to suddenly decide to quit obama would have time to heal the rift with the dedicated clinton voters _meta_end_dot_

 he could convince these democrats that hey he s the future _meta_end_dot_

 he s the party and he s going to take back the white house for the people who work hard to be represented _meta_end_dot_

 he ll let them know that together the can change the dynamic in this nation proving once and for all that we are a nation of hopes of dreams of unity _meta_end_dot_

 if she does not withdraw the party s wounds will be kept open with acid added and the nation will elect a maverick war hero with a conservative bent _meta_end_dot_

 cue chumba wumba _meta_end_dot_

 the song like the candidate is pure _meta_number_ref_ for barry s part from the same ap piece karl rove told sean hannity last monday night they re going to denver _meta_end_dot_

 the only thing which would make this more mirthful methinks is if hillary were to try to run up all _meta_number_ref_ steps of the philadelphia museum of art every day until the _meta_number_ref_nd _meta_end_dot_

 and btw hillary rocky ran up only _meta_number_ref_ of the _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 that s a little more than half and don t tell us that you directed that movie and had to dodge sniper fire while climbing mount everest to yankee stadium to do it _meta_end_dot_
