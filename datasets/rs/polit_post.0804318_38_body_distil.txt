 after an impressive _meta_number_ref_ quarters of economic growth it only took newly anointed speaker pelosi and her liberal colleagues less than one year to hobble a previously growing economy _meta_end_dot_

 a year ago this week congress began to impose dangerous_meta_number_ref_ s economic policies high taxes escalating regulatory burdens and special favors for politically connected businesses _meta_end_dot_

 if history truly does repeat itself then how can we be surprised that today s economy now teeters towards recession _meta_end_question_

 during jimmy carter s era most of us remember the result hyperinflation stagnant growth and imperiled economic prosperity for all americans _meta_end_dot_

 we must not revert to a failed command and control system worthy of the former soviet union mandates higher taxes wagering on yet to be achieved technological breakthroughs and choking off tried and true ways of producing reliable and inexpensive energy _meta_end_dot_

 america s future depends on developing all energy sources _meta_end_dot_

 instead democrats are looking to deliver higher prices unreliable supplies such as electricity brownouts and gas lines and a stagnant and shackled economy _meta_end_dot_

 america s economy relies on abundant available and inexpensive energy _meta_end_dot_

 energy is the lifeblood of modern dynamic and growing economies _meta_end_dot_

 if we release our demonstrated talent and expertise energy will be generated from these sources and result in comfort mobility and prosperity _meta_end_dot_

 america s economy is also in desperate need of permanent tax reductions for hardworking taxpayers _meta_end_dot_

 the recent economic stimulus package that president bush and speaker pelosi approved while doing no harm it does not offer genuine reforms to stimulate the economy _meta_end_dot_

 real stimulus involves permanent tax reductions on hardworking taxpayers and businesses to create permanent income that results in long term productivity economic growth and jobs _meta_end_dot_

 hardworking americans know the keys to generating prosperity remove the dead weight of government taxes and regulations to unleash the creativity and entrepreneurial risk taking of the american people _meta_end_dot_

 don t punish hardworking taxpayers business owners and entrepreneurs _meta_end_dot_

 remove unnecessary regulations imposed by faceless bureaucrats _meta_end_dot_

 permanently reduce their taxes and not with the knee jerk band aid fixes of temporary relief that the american people have sadly come to expect from congress _meta_end_dot_

 we must look towards the future with renewed enthusiasm while remembering the mistakes of our past _meta_end_dot_

 if we do this i am confident that america can continue its global economic leadership without saddling tomorrow s generation with poor and hasty decisions _meta_end_dot_

 speaker pelosi wants to lead america backwards _meta_end_dot_

 i along with fellow pro growth republicans want to lead it into the future _meta_end_dot_
