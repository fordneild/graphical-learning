  here s how it works liberal reporter or politician makes a multi part claim of some atrocity or some other happening that can be be laid at the feet of the nearest republican e g _meta_end_dot_

 a soldier who is a private by the name of john reports that his platoon regularly wore children s skulls as headgear used armored cars to saw dogs in half all the while being forced to go out on missions patrols without ammunition thanks to profits for halliburton _meta_end_exclamation_

 conservatives and republicans question the story because it sounds and is incredible _meta_end_dot_

 liberal reporter politician produce a private whose first name is john and who once came across a grave yard where he saw some bones _meta_end_dot_

 they then declare themselves vindicated and then attempt to blow past the fact that no other person in the private s unit or command line can verify a single one of his claims _meta_end_dot_

 ace puts it in his own distinct style here _meta_end_dot_

 more below _meta_end_dot_

 in other words it s the same thing as using one ounce of truth as a passport to credibility for a ton of lies _meta_end_dot_

 it s how the ap escaped having to account for the falsehoods they printed in the _meta_number_ref_ iraq bylined stories they wrote citing jamil hussein that a jamil ghulaim existed was what they used to declare themselves vindicated and by implication all their stories confirmed notwithstanding the fact that among other things the mosques that were supposedly burnt down in their dispatches are still standing and unburnt _meta_end_dot_

 jake tapper here is trying the ap s patented jamil hussein maneuver now to protect barack obama there was a captain and replacement parts sometimes came in late therefore it s all true _meta_end_exclamation_

 however the fact remains that the existence of the captain then lieutenant means that the only part of obama s statement that was true was that a captain spoke to him about minor logistical issues that occur in every military in both war and peace and no amount of hope and change barring the invention of star trek like teleportation machines is going to change that _meta_end_dot_

 obama is trying to sell us a bill of goods but considering that most of the fourth estate thinks the universe regularly reorients itself to make all he says true this just might get elevated to the status of stuff everyone knows _meta_end_dot_

 in the end as jeff says of obama below either
