  yesterday s breakthrough announcement on ethical stem cell research was greeted by statements of praise and skepticism from politicos from the white house to capitol hill to the campaign trail _meta_end_dot_

 but there was a curious silence from the democratic presidential candidates _meta_end_dot_

 not one issued a press release or made so much as a passing comment on the news _meta_end_dot_

 a search of the online news rooms for each of the candidates produced no mentions of stem cells not even among the lesser candidates who might have used the news to try and draw attention to their campaigns _meta_end_dot_

 these democrats are the ones who claim to have so much compassion for the suffering and afflicted and who label their political opponents as heartless and cruel _meta_end_dot_

 so why the silence on this advancement _meta_end_question_

 in some cases it could be because the campaigns are seeking a way to appear to praise the announcement while not offending embryonic stem cell research advocates among the their supporters _meta_end_dot_

 for sen _meta_end_dot_

 hillary clinton and sen _meta_end_dot_

 barack obama it may be because in a crucial vote for ethical stem cell alternatives taken earlier this year they voted no _meta_end_dot_

 read on the hope act was introduced by sen _meta_end_dot_

 norm coleman r mn in march of this year and was passed by the senate in april by a vote of _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 three of the democratic presidential candidates voted on the legislation _meta_end_dot_

 only sen _meta_end_dot_

 joe biden voted in favor _meta_end_dot_

 sen _meta_end_dot_

 chris dodd did not vote and clinton and obama voted no _meta_end_dot_

 the stated purposes of the hope offered through principled and ethical stem cell research or hope act are to in other words the hope act s purpose was to support and promote the very same kind of research that resulted in the breakthrough announced yesterday _meta_end_dot_

 it cannot be said that the act led to the result however clearly those who voted no on the act cannot reasonably claim to support the result _meta_end_dot_

 if clinton and obama had their way yesterday s research result might never have happened at all _meta_end_dot_

 the hope act is not yet law _meta_end_dot_

 it is currently sitting in the house committee on energy and commerce _meta_end_dot_

 clinton and obama will probably argue that their votes didn t prevent anything since the act has yet to be enacted _meta_end_dot_

 but their votes do explain their thinking _meta_end_dot_

 clinton and obama are all for cures for sick and injured people as long as it benefits them politically _meta_end_dot_

 in this case there is no political upside for the candidates to embrace the results announced yesterday _meta_end_dot_

 if they do they expose themselves to charges of flip flopping and hypocrisy _meta_end_dot_

 it s better to stay silent _meta_end_dot_

 because in the end it s not really about cures for diseases it s about votes and about beating bush _meta_end_dot_
