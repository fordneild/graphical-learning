  both hillary clinton and barack obama are the most protectionist major presidential candidates to come down the pike in recent memory _meta_end_dot_

 i say recent because of course there is one particular president who was in the same league with both clinton and obama when it came to promulgating lousy trade policy and making the country suffer for it _meta_end_dot_

 i know that charlie black works for the mccain campaign and gets paid to throw elbows but he is right to go where he goes verbally
