  first i m endorsing obama for democratic nominee not president _meta_end_dot_

 i ve already made my views clear on who i want for commander in chief _meta_end_dot_

 but before explaining further i want to address the principles undergirding this choice _meta_end_dot_

 the fundamental question is this _meta_end_dot_

 do we conservatives want the worst democratic candidate to be nominated thereby improving the gop candidate s chances or do we want the best democratic candidate facing the best republican candidate _meta_end_question_

 i pick the latter _meta_end_dot_

 why _meta_end_question_

 opinions will vary but i believe that it s in our nation s best interest for the people to choose among two reasonably strong candidates _meta_end_dot_

 we have a two party system and it works best when both parties and both sets of candidates are non dysfunctional _meta_end_dot_

 more below the fold _meta_end_dot_

 so why obama over hillary or edwards _meta_end_question_

 first scratch edwards _meta_end_dot_

 i can t stand his stupid two americas schtick and he isn t viable anyway _meta_end_dot_

 in his home state of south carolina edwards is a distant third going by the rcp average _meta_end_dot_

 in florida edwards is even more pathetic _meta_end_dot_

 he should give up the dream drop out of the race and endorse obama _meta_end_dot_

 so that leaves hillary and obama _meta_end_dot_

 my decision for obama isn t because of his positions on the issues _meta_end_dot_

 from what i can see there isn t a lot of daylight between the two _meta_end_dot_

 they both want major government intervention in health care they re wrongheaded on iraq they favor higher taxes and more government spending they re pro roe v _meta_end_dot_

 wade and they would appoint left wing judges _meta_end_dot_

 hillary may have fleshed out her issues a little better but they re still liberal left wing issues _meta_end_dot_

 obama gets the nod for one because he is a transcendant candidate _meta_end_dot_

 he is smart he has a positive message and he is a less polarizing figure _meta_end_dot_

 if elected there will be plenty of differences to hash out but he appears to be a person whom republicans could better work with _meta_end_dot_

 the other reason i favor obama is that i find hillary clinton and her political machine to be a detestable and diseased entity that has no business being near the white house _meta_end_dot_

 she is an unlikeable politician who uses slimeball tactics to get her way _meta_end_dot_

 if she is so willing to take the low road on the campaign trail against a fellow democrat there is plenty of reason to believe she would do the same against republican opponents by orders of magnitude and there is plenty of reason to believe she would do the same as president _meta_end_dot_

 i would rather not have another four or eight years of white hot gloves off hyperpartisanship _meta_end_dot_

 we are a nation at war and we don t need that _meta_end_dot_

 back in _meta_number_ref_ bill clinton lied his way into the white house remember him saying we had the worst economy in _meta_number_ref_ years and when he was elected he applied the practice of dissembling demagoguing and demonizing his opponents for political gain _meta_end_dot_

 in _meta_number_ref_ when bob dole confronted bill clinton because of a dishonest attack clinton said that you gotta do what you gotta do nothing has changed in _meta_number_ref_ and the same players are still in play _meta_end_dot_

 it is clear to me that slick willie and slick hillie will say or do whatever they can get away with _meta_end_dot_

 this was exemplified last week in the south carolina debate when hillary said that obama really liked the ideas of the republicans factcheck org was being nice by saying the claim was false _meta_end_dot_

 either hillary has a major reading comprehension problem or she lied and i don t believe got as far as she did in her career by misreading transcripts _meta_end_dot_

 that lie was amplified when the clinton team aired a radio ad in south carolina implying that obama favored republican ideas _meta_end_dot_

 thankfully enough democrats were offended by it that the machine pulled the ads but hillary s advisers want the negative campaign to continue yet here is hillary on the today show dishonestly saying she s just counterpunching _meta_end_dot_

 was raising obama s past cocaine use a counterpunch _meta_end_question_

 were those robo calls in nevada about barack hussein obama a counterpunch _meta_end_question_

 democrats actually all of us don t deserve this tripe _meta_end_dot_

 why else would i endorse a candidate on the other side _meta_end_question_

 because as they say in war the enemy gets a vote and i think it s important for republicans to get off the sidelines and challenge the clinton machine head on _meta_end_dot_

 if she gets nominated then it would be a good warm up for the general _meta_end_dot_

 if she doesn t then we have helped improve the american political landscape by pushing that woman and her grasping husband off the national stage _meta_end_dot_

 update if obama somehow gets nominated and picks hillary as a running mate then this post is inoperative and all bets are off _meta_end_dot_
