  here s an added wrinkle in this whole phone call issue _meta_end_dot_

 from the salt lake tribune we have this who gets paid _meta_dollor_ref_ a month by the romney campaign _meta_end_dot_

 likewise is rose kramer the same rose kramer that gets _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ a month from the romney campaign _meta_end_question_

 now let me throw out a new theory that i ve been mulling over since talking to a friend this morning _meta_end_dot_

 gage and target point have denied doing push polling _meta_end_dot_

 these calls lasted about _meta_number_ref_ minutes according to the people who have been interviewed about them _meta_end_dot_

 what if these weren t push polls but actual polling by a campaign _meta_end_question_

 and the people who ran to the press were hypersensitive to the issue because they re already supporting romney and paid by the campaign _meta_end_dot_

 let s get directly to my theory which i admit is a bit off the wall _meta_end_dot_

 what if a campaign conducted a legitimate poll push polls don t last _meta_number_ref_ minutes asked about the mormon issues in the polling and romney supporters who happened to get the call ran to the media screaming about them being push polls _meta_end_dot_

 now and here s the wild speculation on my part what if legitimate polling was being done by the romney campaign or a third party group or a democrat who really doesn t care to find out why the romney campaign has reached an apparent ceiling in iowa and new hampshire and out of an abundance of caution wanted to see if the mormon factor is actually having an impact _meta_end_question_

 because of the nature of the questions some mitt supporters thought they were being push polled and the whole thing blew up _meta_end_dot_

 a wild theory i admit but when you consider the length of time these calls lasted they do seem to be extremely extensive to be a real push poll which are usually as fast as they are dirty _meta_end_dot_
