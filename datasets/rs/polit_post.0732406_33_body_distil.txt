  but that doesn t mean that comments like the ones reported on here won t serve to drive up oil prices and increase instability in the world _meta_end_dot_

 at some point in time it becomes incumbent on opec to rein chavez in and point out that in the long term he is doing great damage to the cartel s ability to get along with the rest of the world _meta_end_dot_

 chavez s statements lend an increasing air of unpredictability to energy policy and with that unpredictability comes an increased chance for serious and sustained trouble _meta_end_dot_

 eventually that trouble could turn into violence _meta_end_dot_

 and that would be the last thing opec s member nations at least the more responsible among them would need _meta_end_dot_
