  democrats have to be asking themselves how they got to this point _meta_end_dot_

 hopes of a quick and definitive primary have disappeared and they find themselves embroiled in a bitter stalemate punctuated with accusations of racism and sexism while the gop nominee uses the time to raise money and mend fences _meta_end_dot_

 the irony of course is that hillary clinton has gone from being the inevitable and early nominee to waging a desperate battle until the convention from planning an above the fray campaign with feints to the center to throwing everything she can think of at her opponent no matter the ideological coherence or potential damage to the party _meta_end_dot_

 and with the awkward question of what to do with the delegates from michigan and florida still left unresolved democrats have to be wondering how far and how ugly this can go _meta_end_dot_

 a few things are clear hillary won t give up as long as there is a slim chance for victory and she will use all available weapons _meta_end_dot_

 if there is a remotely plausible scenario where she wins she will hang on _meta_end_dot_

 if a tactic has a chance of giving her an advantage no matter how temporary she will use it _meta_end_dot_

 what sometimes gets lost in the mythology and nostalgia surrounding the clintons particularly among hardcore democrats is that their primary mode of politics is to attack in order to survive _meta_end_dot_

 read on for more on this pattern and its implications _meta_end_dot_

 the pattern plays itself out with regularity they overreach politically or refuse to come clean about ethical lapses their response is to attack the press and their critics and the goal quickly switches from accomplishment to survival _meta_end_dot_

 the problem is that they have pulled this off so often that they believe they are invincible that they really are martyrs to a vast conspiracy _meta_end_dot_

 hillary in particular has never been known to reflect on her actions and there inevitable repercussions _meta_end_dot_

 her first response is always attack _meta_end_exclamation_

 what did hillary do when confronted with questions about land deals and investments in arkansas _meta_end_question_

 she stonewalled lied and attacked the press and her critics all the while pretending that she was completely innocent _meta_end_dot_

 when confronted with the paula jones lawsuit what was her reaction _meta_end_question_

 adamantly refuse to compromise and instead attack and demean jones in the press until she refused to settle _meta_end_dot_

 this fateful choice nearly destroyed her husband s presidency _meta_end_dot_

 this character attack tactic continued with kathleen wiley and others _meta_end_dot_

 and yet when her husband finally admitted lying about monica lewinsky to not only the entire country and his close friends and associates but to hillary herself what was her reaction _meta_end_question_

 immediately organize the political defense of her husband _meta_end_dot_

 in the senate when she faced what she described as the hardest decision she has ever had to make the decision whether to go to war in iraq she cast her vote for war _meta_end_dot_

 this could have been a courageous chance to defend the vote as correct despite the subsequent repercussions or to admit she was wrong _meta_end_dot_

 instead she tied herself in knots trying to rationalize her vote and her subsequent strident anti war rhetoric and went on to attack obama s stand against the war as mere words despite her policy wonk persona and her claims of being qualified to be commander in chief hillary s real experience lies not in real life leadership or war and diplomacy but in the political war room _meta_end_dot_

 she is an expert not in accomplishment but in the never ending campaign _meta_end_dot_

 this is exactly what she is waging today _meta_end_dot_

 in the past when an opponent criticized her or her husband the plan was always to attack their credibility by whatever means necessary and marginalize them whenever possible _meta_end_dot_

 she has employed this same tactic against barack obama _meta_end_dot_

 but obama is not ken star or newt gingrich or rick lazio _meta_end_dot_

 obama is the first credible african american presidential candidate and even now the likely democratic nominee _meta_end_dot_

 hillary s scorched earth style may give her hope of victory but the longer it plays out and the uglier it gets the stronger the likelihood it leaves bitter feelings behind _meta_end_dot_

 in the identity politics of the democratic party attempts to marginalize obama are going to be seen as marginalizing his community and raising racial tensions _meta_end_dot_

 hillary has never shown willingness to compromise and her entire career is based on refusing to face reality and instead fight tooth and nail for survival _meta_end_dot_

 why would she suddenly decide to rise above it all and put her party first _meta_end_question_

 deep down this has to worry democrats _meta_end_dot_

 the republican response pass the popcorn _meta_end_dot_
