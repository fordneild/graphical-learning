  so it is clear that the race between hillary clinton and barack obama has now taken on distinctly racial undertones _meta_end_dot_

 and the consequence is that the clinton campaign is in quite the uncomfortable position read on _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 a whole heck of a lot more can be found here _meta_end_dot_

 to be fair to the former president i saw a video of his comments and i agree that the fairy tale he was referring to was the assertion by obama that he obama had been consistently against the war in iraq from the very beginning _meta_end_dot_

 of course that doesn t change the fact that making the fairy tale comment was a bad idea from the beginning and that it has made the clinton campaign look insensitive in the extreme _meta_end_dot_

 this isn t hindsight talking the clintons have had ample warning that they need to be very careful in how they take on obama and they chose not to pay heed to that warning _meta_end_dot_

 they are now suffering blowback as a result and they can t say that they didn t see it coming _meta_end_dot_

 meanwhile and relatedly there is this that be something _meta_end_question_

 i don t expect obama to win new york but if he does enough to make hillary clinton spend precious time and resources securing her own adopted backyard that could prove pivotal in a race that has turned into a major battle _meta_end_dot_
