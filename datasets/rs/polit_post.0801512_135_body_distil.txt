 good stuff _meta_end_dot_

 i voted in the michigan republican primary this morning before going to work _meta_end_dot_

 there was a little bit of snow overnight but it stopped by the time i headed out _meta_end_dot_

 in livonia a suburb of detroit we got about _meta_number_ref_ to _meta_number_ref_ inches _meta_end_dot_

 weather reports indicate that snowfall was fairly spotty in the detroit area _meta_end_dot_

 some places got as much as _meta_number_ref_ to _meta_number_ref_ inches _meta_end_dot_

 the roads were in good condition although a bit slushy _meta_end_dot_

 roads and sidewalks will probably melt by noon _meta_end_dot_

 not much activity at the voting precinct _meta_end_dot_

 there weren t even any campaigners near the entrance _meta_end_dot_

 there were no lines at the tables and maybe one or two other voters in the room _meta_end_dot_

 my ballot was the _meta_number_ref_th cast so far today on the republican side _meta_end_dot_

 read on _meta_end_dot_

 currently my top preference is thompson closely followed by romney _meta_end_dot_

 mccain is a more distant third followed by giuliani and huckabee rounding out last _meta_end_dot_

 i might be reluctant about some but i would probably vote for any of them over a democrat in the general election _meta_end_dot_

 today i decided to vote for romney even though i prefer thompson more _meta_end_dot_

 i want to keep my second option viable _meta_end_dot_

 i would love to have the primary narrow down to a contest between thompson and romney _meta_end_dot_

 thompson is not competing here in michigan and there is no real hope in the michigan polls _meta_end_dot_

 polls do indicate the michigan race is tight between mccain and romney _meta_end_dot_

 i could live with mccain but i would rather have romney more _meta_end_dot_

 also a romney win would slow mccain s momentum going into south carolina which should improve thompson s chances _meta_end_dot_
