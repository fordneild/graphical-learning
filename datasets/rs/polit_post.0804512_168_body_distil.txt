  promoted by dan mclaughlin senator barack obama means it when he says he stands for change _meta_end_dot_

 he wants to change the definition of patriotism _meta_end_dot_

 he means to redefine what a patriotic corporation is _meta_end_dot_

 senator sherrod brown d ohio describes a piece of legislation that he and senator obama have brought to us from the economic twilight zone the man refuses to wear the american flag on his lapel while holding a seat in the us senate _meta_end_dot_

 that right there should provide ample evidence that he has no business telling anyone how to define patriotism _meta_end_dot_

 idiocy is not only afoot but mounted on a lightning steed _meta_end_dot_

 the patriot employer act of _meta_number_ref_ could become a crowbar by which the federal government can not only redefine what a good american corporation is but also define how effectively the federal government can interfere in the business marketplace _meta_end_dot_

 read on _meta_end_dot_

 senator durbin serves as another jacobin willing to play the pigeon and help senator obama increase the movement of modern america towards a more totalitarian democracy _meta_end_dot_

 he also co sponsored this neo socialist bilge and offered a predictable and risible defense of this indefensible garbage legislation _meta_end_dot_

 senator durbin describes the proposed legislation below _meta_end_dot_

 all of this sounds relatively benign until the assumptions upon which this rests are examined _meta_end_dot_

 a _meta_percent_ref_ tax break in and of itself will not lower the operating costs of any major corporation enough to justify the termination of outsourcing _meta_end_dot_

 outsourcers already take on high level of risk to outsource in the first place _meta_end_dot_

 nike for example risks losing operational control over its supply chain to manufacture nikes throughout south east asia _meta_end_dot_

 they also have a _meta_number_ref_ month production cycle they have to synchronize with a _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ month demand cycle that is also seasonal _meta_end_dot_

 i wish the operations researcher in charge of optimizing that retail inventory system and thereby managing nike s supply chain risk all the luck in the world _meta_end_dot_

 to keep from losing its footwear in the pacific nike had to go into the business of solving non trivial mathematical scheduling problems and furthermore set up and monitor an entire shipping network _meta_end_dot_

 nike is now either contracting for or paying full time salaries to an additional building full computer programmers and professional mathematicians just to keep track their shoes _meta_end_dot_

 leona helmsley and ivana trump may empathize _meta_end_dot_

 outsourcing is never free _meta_end_dot_

 the point to all of this is simply that obama s bill isn t designed to actually make a corporation comply out of direct economic self interest _meta_end_dot_

 the savings offered by a _meta_percent_ref_ tax break will not justify nike insourcing its entire pacific rim manufacturing operation _meta_end_dot_

 very few multinational giants will look at this incentive and jump aboard for the sake of the cash infusion alone _meta_end_dot_

 the bill has a much less benign purpose than even that proported by the economic nationalists who seek to subsidize outmoded domestic jobs that would otherwise fall to marketplace attrition _meta_end_dot_

 this bill serves as a data marker to help keep a little list just like the gilbert and sullivan character ko ko in mikado _meta_end_dot_

 once senator obama has his santa claus lists of which corporations are naughty and which ones are nice the patriot games involving more punitive follow on legislation can commence _meta_end_dot_
