  the latest in kick _meta_beep_ref_ war reporting comes from bill ardolino currently embedded in baghdad and reporting for the absolutely indispensable long war journal _meta_end_dot_

 as an aside i d like to take a moment to exhort my colleagues at redstate and across the sphere to rely on the hands down best news source of the global war on terror the long war journal instead of linking the nyt wapo etc _meta_end_dot_

 when they have their one in a million informed honest articles _meta_end_dot_

 the long war journal is the ap afp reuters insert wire here of the gwot _meta_end_dot_

 unfortunately it lacks the recognition and accolades that it deserves especially since it offers the best most timely most accurate and most comprehensive reportage on the long war of pretty much any outfit in the known world _meta_end_dot_

 want to know what s going on in iraq afghanistan or anywhere else that matters in the gwot _meta_end_question_

 get your up to the minute and accurate reportage including eyewitness reports from key embeds who go where mainstream journalists don t dare from the long war journal and tell all of your friends about it as well anyway back to ardolino s latest _meta_end_dot_

 he s in rusafa a large district in central baghdad bordered by the tigris river to the southwest and sadr city to the northeast the district which is predominantly shia but contains significant sunni enclaves and a small christian population with a surprising number of openly practicing churches and which has been known in the past to have heavy jaish al mahdi mahdi army activity _meta_end_dot_

 aside from its bordering on the suddenly flagrant sadr city rusafa is important because the district contains baghdad s largest and most famous markets including the shorja saria and bab al sharji some of which were the scenes of high profile suicide bombings during the sectarian fueled carnage of _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ read on _meta_end_dot_

 according to ardolino begun by the coalition s change in strategy and increase in numbers but has been maintained and will be in the future if it is to continue by the iraqis themselves _meta_end_dot_

 the _meta_number_ref_ soldiers of the _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ cavalry are the only coalition troops in rusafa writes ardolino _meta_end_dot_

 they are responsible for the district s security in conjunction with thousands of iraqi army iraqi national police iraqi police kurdish private contractors and sons of iraq the sons of iraq are to rusafa what the concerned local citizens groups are in the areas immediately around the district _meta_end_dot_

 like those concerned local citizens groups which seemed to sprout from nowhere beginning late last summer going from tentative meetings about organizing neighborhood watches like this one that i was present at in the middle of august to filling their rolls with tens of thousands of volunteers in less than five months the sons of iraq have since their establishment seven months ago grown in size and in effectiveness to the point where captain john thornburg commander of the _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ s bravo troop credits them with having turned one of the most violent areas of baghdad into one of the most quiet says thornburg above all though writes ardolino faris abdul hassan leader of rusafa s sons of iraq tand his neighborhood watchmen do not like the mahdi army the recent flare ups in sadr city have added to the public s resistance against what remains of muqtada al sadr s militia _meta_end_dot_

 since the government operation against the mahdi army in basrah began in march writes ardolino mahdi fighters began firing mortars and rockets from sadr city itself a move that spurred the recent iraqi army and us incursion into the poor shia enclave _meta_end_dot_

 many educated people know that both the mahdi army and iran are affiliated with sadr ardolino quotes one iraqi as saying and that his popularity is waning in rusafa as a result _meta_end_dot_

 he is in iran not even here fighting with his own people as american brigades rotate back to the home front and are not replaced in keeping with the drawdown of the successful surge tactic that supplemented the counterinsurgency strategy implemented by the coalition in _meta_number_ref_ leaving the u s _meta_end_dot_

 units still there to cover wider and wider swaths of the california sized country thereby exacerbating the already stretched thin state of the small american force in iraq an opportunity is created for the iraqi security forces and neighborhood watches to really begin pulling their weight in the effort to secure their districts and maintain order in their homeland _meta_end_dot_

 ardolino writes that this process may be being helped along a bit by the recent conflict in basra and the current friction in sadr city _meta_end_dot_

 some american officials he writes believe that the iraqi government s confrontation with the militia is giving the iraqi army momentum and further shifting public opinion he concludes there are some areas in iraq where the isf iraqi security forces have received the best possible training and are accepted as being a legitimate positive force in the community _meta_end_dot_

 in the rest of the country situations like these give the iraqi people the opportunity to come to that conclusion about their own local isf and can help further drive those civilians who simply want to live their lives both peacefully and prosperously away from the weakened militias and toward the increasingly legitimate organizations of the democratic state of iraq _meta_end_dot_
