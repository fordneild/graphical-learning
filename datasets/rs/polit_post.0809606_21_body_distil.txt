  after all this time and all the anticipation ron paul has finally made peace with his compatriots and made his endorsement _meta_end_dot_

 what s that _meta_end_question_

 john mccain _meta_end_question_

 oh my no _meta_end_dot_

 ron paul is still running for president and trying to steal other candidates pledged delegates _meta_end_dot_

 even though he s perfectly happy to take the endorsement of a party his campaign claims is not viable ibid he won t step up and acknowledge the victory of the man who earned enough pledged delegates to assure a first ballot gop victory and who will be leading us to november _meta_end_dot_

 no ron paul won t endorse the man who has earned the endorsement of the republican party s voters but he will and has endorsed the john birch society _meta_end_dot_

 yes that john birch society _meta_end_dot_

 the one that accused president eisenhower of being a communist _meta_end_dot_

 the one that william f _meta_end_dot_

 buckley whom many of us remember today rightly threw out of the conservative movement _meta_end_dot_

 ron paul endorsed them and removed all doubt of his position with respect to the conservative movement _meta_end_dot_

 read on _meta_end_dot_

 quoting a release sent out via email by jbs pr manager bill hahn what kind of group is it that ron paul is endorsing as hahn says wishes success for and will speak to _meta_end_question_

 conspiracy nuts _meta_end_dot_

 that s all they are _meta_end_dot_

 they were when they envisioned ike as a secret red and they are when they claim that just four years from now _meta_end_dot_

 the united states may cease to exist as an independent political entity due to the north american union machinations oft he council on foreign relations _meta_end_dot_

 yes it s from there that all those nuts come and start ranting about nau roads and highways taking over america _meta_end_dot_

 and ron paul values their educational program more importantly this is a group that puts the lie to ron paul s statements in the debates _meta_end_dot_

 he told carl cameron in the january _meta_number_ref_ debate that while he refuses to denounce the _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ truthers and respects their freedom to have their views he does not agree with them _meta_end_dot_

 it was a pretty weasely answer for a constitution thumper who talks simply of civil liberties and an isolationist foreign policy _meta_end_dot_

 however now that camera is off all eyes looking at barack obama and hillary clinton he goes and endorses the jbs when they re one of the bigger truther societies around _meta_end_dot_

 just look at this dvd they are selling _meta_end_dot_

 in fact it s one of their featured products at the john birch society _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ press for truth by ray nowosielski using work by paul thompson claims to present some of the most glaring discrepancies lies and coverups concerning the deadliest terrorist attack on american soil and what kind of coverups do they expose _meta_end_question_

 let s list a few the story that some israelis were warned of the attacks wtc_meta_number_ref_ building alarm issues and alleged oddities in the president s schedule that day _meta_end_dot_

 the whole site reads like someone who believes the attack to be an inside job _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ a m _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ a m september _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ president bush enters classroom photo op still claims to think wtc crash is accidental claims _meta_end_question_

 claims _meta_end_question_

 does anyone in touch with reality actually think that president bush knew more about these attacks than he let on _meta_end_question_

 seriously _meta_end_question_

 but alright that s just a dvd that the john birch society is selling _meta_end_dot_

 what about their own magazine the new american _meta_end_question_

 do a search for _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ and you get an article entitled able danger and _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ foreknowledge that concludes with these lines my friends this is the effort of education that ron paul cheers _meta_end_dot_

 this is where ron paul is at home among the kooks and nuts _meta_end_dot_

 and this isn t just a fluke either _meta_end_dot_

 in pressing for the truth on _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ the birchers cheer _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ press for truth as they continue to suggest the us government to be in league with al qaeda the time has come to stop distinguishing ron paul from his tin foil hatted supporters _meta_end_dot_

 he is not above them he is of them _meta_end_dot_

 he agrees with them he joins them in their gatherings and he cheers them in their spreading of nutty conspiracy theories _meta_end_dot_

 this is the real ron paul _meta_end_dot_

 do we want this in our party _meta_end_question_

 i say no _meta_end_dot_

 on today the memorial day of william f _meta_end_dot_

 buckley we should excuse paul from our political movement once and for all just as he threw out the birchers once upon a time _meta_end_dot_
