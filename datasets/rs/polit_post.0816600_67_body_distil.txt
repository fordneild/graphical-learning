  jim geraghty has a nice post up on the junior senator from illinois views on the new rochelle commuter train which was what obama used as an example of a life that was just going through the motions and what the rest of us would just call normal a taste about a decade go i rode a commuter train to my regular not very interesting little job _meta_end_dot_

 day in day out three hours of travel time which sounds very bad until you consider the potentials for reading and or sleep that this entails _meta_end_dot_

 besides that s where the job was and i needed to work _meta_end_dot_

 i did that for five six years until i moved south to maryland and eventually got married _meta_end_dot_

 not exciting but like jim geraghty i consider there to be nothing wrong with that kind of life _meta_end_dot_

 and again like jim i m kind of ticked that this is somehow considered less real or meaningful by some _meta_end_dot_

 the dignity of a man s life should not be subject to the arbitrary judgment of others and it is annoying when it is _meta_end_dot_

 moe lane ps i almost didn t note this but somebody should _meta_end_dot_

 senator barack obama if the new rochelle train was anything like my own commute then some of the people that rode it are now dead murdered in a war that you now decline to properly oversee _meta_end_dot_

 but i understand that their last moments of life were very dynamic so perhaps they didn t mind so much _meta_end_dot_
