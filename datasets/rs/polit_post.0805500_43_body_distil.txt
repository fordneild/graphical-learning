  jack murtha is invincible _meta_end_dot_

 he s survived abscam hannity and colmes vid and waltzed through recklessly slandering our troops in iraq _meta_end_dot_

 and he seeks to walk to his _meta_number_ref_th term with the help of two republicans bill russell campaign site is a _meta_number_ref_ year old army veteran who wanted to challenge democrat murtha as a republican but he might not be included on the republican ballot in pennsylvania s _meta_number_ref_th congressional district because of two people referring to themselves as republicans former johnstown mayor don zucco and johnstown attorney jeanne mckelvey _meta_end_dot_

 those two have petitioned the commonwealth court to keep russell s name off the april _meta_number_ref_nd ballot because they insist he did not collect the requisite _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ voters signatures _meta_end_dot_

 read on russell says he had more than _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ valid signatures but he s counting on the stupidity of the two republican petitioners _meta_end_dot_

 on the court papers the listed him as william m _meta_end_dot_

 russell his name is actually william t _meta_end_dot_

 russell if the signatures are not valid their complaint is _meta_end_dot_

 and if they win murtha is unopposed this november _meta_end_dot_

 i got my story from the pittsburgh tribune review who say they tried to contact the two republicans for the story but received no comment _meta_end_dot_

 murtha s hometown paper the johnstown tribune democrat got this comment from republican zucco there are lots of ways to support the congressman he supports murtha _meta_end_dot_

 well he s a former mayor of johnstown who has at least seen his city s pockets stuffed by murtha in the form of earmarks pork _meta_end_dot_

 nobody has talked to mckelvey _meta_end_dot_

 we ll keep an eye on this one but it looks like murtha may have been spared another challenge by that solid republican constituency gopers _meta_number_ref_ okinawa jack
