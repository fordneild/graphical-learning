  markos moulitsas s first issuance for newsweek reads like the dnc press release it is likely meant to be _meta_end_dot_

 and there is at least one glaring mistake in it moulitsas and others similarly situated on the ideological spectrum are used to trying this head fake on the american public _meta_end_dot_

 they repeatedly argue that if republicans don t like government they shouldn t be allowed to run it _meta_end_dot_

 but just because one likes a particular task that does not mean one is necessarily good at it _meta_end_dot_

 moulitsas s critique of the small government position is woefully misinformed _meta_end_dot_

 maybe if he decided at some point to become better read he would understand that _meta_end_dot_
