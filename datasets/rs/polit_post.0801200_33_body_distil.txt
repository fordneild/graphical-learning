  first courtesy of captain s quarters we have lawrence o donnell religious bigot who reports that if john edwards stays in the race he might in the end become nothing other than the southern white man who stood in the way of the black man he then goes on to judge former senator edwards not only by the color of his skin but by the presence of his male genitalia discussion of the content of his character is notable by its absence _meta_end_dot_

 then we have jane smiley scaredy cat who makes the worst accusation about o donnell that she can think of i am fairly sure in my own mind that karl rove paid him to write that post after babbling this and gratuitously insulting various republican candidates for president in what seemed mostly to be pure reflex she then announced that she wrote a big check to john edwards _meta_end_dot_

 then we have the comments which _meta_end_dot_

 tell you the truth i didn t bother _meta_end_dot_

 it s huffpo _meta_end_dot_

 i don t double check stormfront forums either to make sure that they re still vilely insane over there _meta_end_dot_

 pause anyway it s too soon to tell whether the new hampshire primary results were enough to send either the obama or the edwards campaigns off kilter but i ll tell you this it s certainly done it to their sycophants _meta_end_dot_

 moe because karl rove isn t really gone of course and he always hires people who are best known for screaming at john o neill _meta_end_dot_

 yeah _meta_end_dot_

 o donnell s so totally a republican _meta_end_dot_
