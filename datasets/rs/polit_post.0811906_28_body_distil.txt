  justice scalia was the subject of a _meta_number_ref_ minutes profile that was quite fair and exceedingly fascinating _meta_end_dot_

 you can check it out here _meta_end_dot_

 read it all and check out the entire videocast _meta_end_dot_

 it is very well done _meta_end_dot_

 the only thing that really made me groan was the portion where justice ginsburg argued that originalism meant that certain racial classes along with women are read out of the constitution because that was the way the framers wrote the constitution _meta_end_dot_

 this is only the case if you do not consider the amendments that followed _meta_end_dot_

 and failing to consider the amendments that followed is silly beyond measure _meta_end_dot_

 the amendments once ratified are as much part of the constitution as any of the sections written in by the framers in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 it was the framers after all who allowed for an amendment process in the first place and the reason that say we no longer adhere to the despicable practice of considering african americans as slaves _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ths human or disenfranchised is because of the passage of the _meta_number_ref_th _meta_number_ref_th and _meta_number_ref_th amendments to the constitution along with the enabling legislation that was passed by congress and that enforces those amendments _meta_end_dot_

 to say that originalism does not consider the amendments as part of the constitution or that originalism does not give the amendments equal weight to those provisions of the constitution that were written in and ratified in _meta_number_ref_ cannot be taken seriously as justice scalia said in another context _meta_end_dot_

 while we are scalia watching be sure to check out this video of a debate between the justice and nadine strossen president of the aclu i give strossen a lot of credit for engaging people with whom she disagrees she is one of the most frequent speakers before panels and meetings of the federalist society _meta_end_dot_

 but it seems to me that scalia gets the better of her in this debate _meta_end_dot_
