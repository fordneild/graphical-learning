  not to be catatonically sanguine about the fate of the gop but however much i agree with the general tenor of this piece by peggy noonan there is something unsettling about its we re all gonna die tone _meta_end_dot_

 if i had a nickel for every time a political party had been pronounced as having shuffled off its mortal coil _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 well _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 let s just say that i might finally be in a position to turn my beloved bears into serious super bowl contenders _meta_end_dot_

 in the meantime let s remember that political tides shift and change rather rapidly and today s near extinct party has an interesting tendency to become tomorrow s sociopolitical dynamo _meta_end_dot_

 again this is not to say that the gop does not have very real problems _meta_end_dot_

 it does _meta_end_dot_

 the brand needs serious reworking morale on the hill and throughout the party in general needs a boost of major proportions and the leadership needs to be changed _meta_end_dot_

 but even at their weakest major political parties have vast amounts of reserve strength and energy that allows them to wait out the bad times _meta_end_dot_

 sure there are parties that go the way of the dinosaur but these are rather rare events _meta_end_dot_

 more often than not remarkable comebacks are the story of the day _meta_end_dot_

 and yes republicans will actually have to work for that comeback _meta_end_dot_

 the good news for the gop however is that contra what might be gleaned from some pundits that work if done right and diligently will likely not be in vain _meta_end_dot_
