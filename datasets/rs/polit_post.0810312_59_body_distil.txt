  about the consequences of his rhetoric back then _meta_end_dot_

 based on my own subjective analysis of what passes for his foreign and domestic policy he rarely does _meta_end_dot_

 so while you are of course correct to remind him that he agreed to commit to public financing if the gop candidate did it probably won t matter for three reasons _meta_end_dot_

 one he s under no legal compulsion to do so and clearly his own personal sense of honor isn t taking up the slack _meta_end_dot_

 two his core supporters will forgive him for this and it seems any other transgression and he knows it _meta_end_dot_

 so don t count on his sense of shame to sway him or even his sense of knowing how to protect his reputation for keeping his word he apparently lacks the first and i m starting to believe that he s never had a real need to develop the latter _meta_end_dot_

 moe lane ps what _meta_end_question_

 oh three _meta_end_dot_

 well three is obvious he isn t the nominee yet is he _meta_end_question_
