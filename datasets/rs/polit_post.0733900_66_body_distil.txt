  i put something in redhot about my disagreement with how the romney campaign handled a matter today but i want to put up something here that will get more attention _meta_end_dot_

 and this point is definitely not opposed to the romney perspective _meta_end_dot_

 the boston globe has decided to stake out the romney house and harass contract workers on their citizenship status _meta_end_dot_

 i find it highly ironic that a media company opposed to restrictive immigration policies and racial profiling would stand outside someone s house and harass hispanic looking workers to find out if they are illegal aliens _meta_end_dot_

 i actually give governor romney credit for giving the company involved a second chance _meta_end_dot_

 to be sure i would not have publicly released the address and name of the company today as it just sets romney up for a vendetta by the guy _meta_end_dot_

 but it is deplorable that a newspaper would stand outside the man s private home and harass people working at his home to score a partisan shot against him _meta_end_dot_

 that s really pitiful _meta_end_dot_

 made more so because you and i both know they were harassing the workers who looked hispanic solely because of their appearance _meta_end_dot_
