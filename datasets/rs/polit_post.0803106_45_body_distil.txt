  the job front is doing well but the economy is quite anemic _meta_end_dot_

 while the news could be worse it is not good news and it is therefore entirely understandable that the fed chose to cut interest rates by as much as it did today _meta_end_dot_

 responsible monetary policy along with long term stimulus in the form making the tax cuts from _meta_number_ref_ and _meta_number_ref_ permanent and cutting the taxes on capital gains and corporations will have to be implemented in order to ensure the fundamentals of the economy _meta_end_dot_

 the short term stimulus package is a failure waiting to happen _meta_end_dot_

 its only virtue is that it will allow politicians to go back to their constituents and claim that they did something when in fact they are on the verge of enacting a big nothing _meta_end_dot_

 fortunately some elected officials understand that _meta_end_dot_

 they are to be applauded and it is good that the enlightened elected official who is the topic of this paragraph is the house minority whip _meta_end_dot_

 it would be far better if he were the house majority whip _meta_end_dot_

 but of course you know that _meta_end_dot_
