  as i told you yesterday there are gathering signs that the liquidity crisis which has roiled money markets since early this year and became a series of convulsions after the bear stearns collapse is abating _meta_end_dot_

 if conditions continue to stabilize and improve then we can say that aggressive federal reserve intervention indeed solved a systemic liquidity problem that affected the financial system more seriously than similar problems in the past _meta_end_dot_

 but if the defibrillator worked and the patient s heart is beating again we re still waiting for him to start breathing _meta_end_dot_

 dealing with the liquidity crisis doesn t mean we ve done anything to fix the credit crunch _meta_end_dot_

 more the fed s extensive actions have now made it not only the lender of last resort but also the counterparty of last resort _meta_end_dot_

 large institutions can now worry less about counterparty risk because there is an expectation that the fed which can create an infinite amount of cash at will will step in and honor the trades of anyone who gets into trouble _meta_end_dot_

 this is something new under the sun _meta_end_dot_

 ever since commerce was invented success has depended on knowing who you were doing business with _meta_end_dot_

 it remains to be seen whether the fed will withdraw from this role as they say they will once normalcy returns _meta_end_dot_

 but all of these liquidity issues are a problem for wall street not for main street _meta_end_dot_

 there is still an ongoing financial crisis that does affect the real economy and that is the unavailability of credit _meta_end_dot_

 to over simplify banks don t want to lend anyone any money _meta_end_dot_

 why not _meta_end_question_

 in many cases because they have taken such huge losses on mortgage lending that they re at risk of falling below their minimum capital requirements _meta_end_dot_

 they must curtail their lending take in new capital or both in order to satisfy the regulators _meta_end_dot_

 in addition to this there is another phenomenon at work called de leveraging _meta_end_dot_

 many financial institutions around the world are cutting down their holdings of assets financed with short term borrowing _meta_end_dot_

 the world is shifting from debt to equity _meta_end_dot_

 this tends to reduce the value of nearly all asset classes which in turn adds to the pressure on banks _meta_end_dot_

 whenever an asset owned by a bank falls in value accounting rules require the bank to take a charge against their earnings even if the fall in value is temporary and finally although it s not been discussed much there is probably going to be a re evaluation of the risk management tools that have enabled market participants to greatly expand their asset holdings in recent years _meta_end_dot_

 we ve had perhaps eight major global financial crises during the era of modern portfolio theory beginning with the _meta_number_ref_ stock market crash _meta_end_dot_

 and none of them has shaken our faith that proper diversification in accordance with mathematical models can enable risk to be precisely measured so as to allow people to take more of it _meta_end_dot_

 this time may be different _meta_end_dot_

 this crisis has burned so many people in so many corners of the world that we may see great reluctance to go back to the kind of leveraged risk taking of the past ten years _meta_end_dot_

 and that means the great boom in credit formation that has fueled the global economy may slow or even stop _meta_end_dot_

 it s very true and a subject for a different post that the current distress is so far having a mild effect on the real economy _meta_end_dot_

 during the great depression which also started with financial disorders that were then transmitted to the real world gdp fall by half and unemployment rise to _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 that s an epic disaster and for many reasons we ll see nothing remotely that bad _meta_end_dot_

 but i ve occasionally used the phrase great depression ii to describe one of the possible futures in my crystal ball for this specific reason after the financial crises were finally damped out in the summer of _meta_number_ref_ bankers for years afterward showed a strong preference for highly liquid risk free assets _meta_end_dot_

 in other words they used their depositors money to buy short term treasury debt _meta_end_dot_

 they didn t lend it to cities and states or to mortgage borrowers or to businesses or to anyone else _meta_end_dot_

 this is the real reason why the depression lasted as long as it did _meta_end_dot_

 the business cycle got back to normal in fact there was a fairly orthodox cyclical recession in _meta_number_ref_ as the fed stomped on the monetary brakes but everything operated at lower levels than before _meta_end_dot_

 something similar may be in our immediate future _meta_end_dot_

 what concerns me is that normal risk taking the kind that builds wealth and makes capital available for our children s future may not return to the us _meta_end_dot_

 it may simply flee to the emerging world where the growth potential is much greater _meta_end_dot_

 is there a policy response to this _meta_end_question_

 yes but not one that anyone is talking about in this democratic year lower taxes on capital and income and reduced regulation for non financial businesses _meta_end_dot_

 the patient s heart is beating but he has yet to start breathing again _meta_end_dot_

 and at this point in time it s not yet clear what it will take to get him started _meta_end_dot_
