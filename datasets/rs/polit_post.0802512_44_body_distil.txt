  the most salient feature of the current economic and financial environment and what makes it different from much of the past is uncertainty _meta_end_dot_

 measurements of current activity investment patterns and credit markets are giving a conflicting picture of the global economy _meta_end_dot_

 no one knows for sure whether business will pick up which makes everyone reluctant to take risk _meta_end_dot_

 as day follows night the increased uncertainty leads to expectations of lower economic activity _meta_end_dot_

 in the everyday world where reality is whatever journalists say it is on any given day all of this translates into fears of recession _meta_end_dot_

 if you ve been reading me for a while you know i ve been warning of a slowdown since the early days of the credit crisis that exploded in the financial world late last spring _meta_end_dot_

 over the last several days i ve been catching very faint signs that we ve turned the corner and the next direction is up _meta_end_dot_

 for one thing this means that the budget busting circle jerk now taking place in congress over a keynesian stimulus package is an epic exercise in futility _meta_end_dot_

 keep reading _meta_end_dot_

 i m not talking about the stock market _meta_end_dot_

 individual stock prices reflect the outlook for corporate earnings but the stock market as a whole reflects theoretically at least the relative risk of owning businesses as opposed to other kinds of investments _meta_end_dot_

 so while headlines scream about collapses in stock market indexes it takes a more discerning eye to see what is really going on inside the market _meta_end_dot_

 this subject is a post all by itself but i m actually going to sidestep it because the more important signals are occurring in the credit markets _meta_end_dot_

 i believe we re seeing the first signs that the global credit crunch is easing _meta_end_dot_

 i m seeing this in libor rates narrowing spreads for corporate debt the appearance of buyers in distressed assets like bond insurers in commodity prices and several other things _meta_end_dot_

 since credit unavailability is the surest precursor of recessions or of economic slowdowns short of recession this suggests that a key requirement is in place for a return to growth in business activity _meta_end_dot_

 to be quite sure there are sectors of the us economy that never experienced any noticeable distress at all _meta_end_dot_

 if i m right and we are indeed starting to emerge from the mini recession we ve been in then it still remains to be seen which sectors will lead the way out _meta_end_dot_

 the federal reserve will hopefully cut interest rates again next week and keep cutting for some time to come _meta_end_dot_

 i m not going to wade into the currently raging debate over whether ben bernanke showed fatal weakness by both his delays to aggressively cut rates and his sudden turnaround this week _meta_end_dot_

 the jury is still on this and it will be for a long time _meta_end_dot_

 in case it didn t sink in the first time the fed needs to keep cutting _meta_end_dot_

 i would be happy to see the fed funds target rate go to _meta_percent_ref_ or even lower _meta_end_dot_

 as far as the mishugas in congress over stimulating the economy is concerned i say again that they needn t bother _meta_end_dot_

 as a businessman i m thrilled by the republican proposals to accelerate depreciation and increase expensing limits for capital goods _meta_end_dot_

 but this has little to do with temporary fast acting economic stimulus _meta_end_dot_

 i think these are changes that should be made permanent _meta_end_dot_

 i ve said any number of times that the government is much of what is putting america s businesses at a disadvantage in a tough competitive world _meta_end_dot_

 if it takes an ugly recession scare to make voters understand that government is putting america out of business then that s better than nothing _meta_end_dot_

 in regard to the tax rebate checks the only value to these will be to the political party that manages to stamp its name on the checks _meta_end_dot_

 yes short term political advantage is something that to our elected officials is well worth forcing us to borrow an extra _meta_dollor_ref_ billion or more to buy for them _meta_end_dot_

 boy that makes me mad enough to spit _meta_end_dot_

 as far as the approximate doubling of the limits on compliant mortgages is concerned i can see no impact of this on the fortunes of the construction industry or on home values both of which have a lot of excess to work off _meta_end_dot_

 a compliant mortgage is one that is permitted by law to be funded by fannie mae or freddie mac about the democrats attempts to curry favor with local politicians at all levels by giving them goodies to hand out we need to fight this tooth and nail _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_dollor_ref_ billion for temporary summer jobs _meta_end_question_

 _meta_end_exclamation_

 c mon democrats your craven hypocrisy is showing again _meta_end_dot_

 and while we re at it let s force both republicans and democrats in the senate to keep their pig snouts out of our pockets _meta_end_dot_

 no earmarks or superfluous spending in the superfluous stimulus package _meta_end_exclamation_
