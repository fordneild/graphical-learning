  seeing her standing in the polls dropping and a steady stream of criticism from her rivals this week hillary clinton decided it was time to go on the attack _meta_end_dot_

 and it wasn t subtle _meta_end_dot_

 the headlines read like a fox special when hillary attacks _meta_end_exclamation_

 but these attacks could easily spark a backlash that solidifies negative perceptions about her rather than weaken her rivals _meta_end_dot_

 it seems increasingly clear that hillary s angry and combative personality could present a real problem for her campaign _meta_end_dot_

 read on _meta_end_dot_

 in going on the offensive she attacked her perceived chief rival barack obama on a wide range of hot button issues like health care social security abortion and gun control _meta_end_dot_

 but what made the news were not disputes about policy but her odd decision to go after obama on character issues most of the media and the public were stunned that a clinton would raise the issue this is not exactly solid ground given their history _meta_end_dot_

 but what turned a questionable tactic into fodder for an endless stream of jokes cartoons and incredulous blog posts was the campaign s attempt to use obama s childhood aspirations as proof that he was just another ambitious and calculating politician _meta_end_dot_

 i can t possibly guess what it was she thought was to be gained in focusing on the childhood presidential ambitions of obama _meta_end_dot_

 hillary accusing obama of being overly ambitious simply reminds voters of her own inflated sense of entitlement and calculating persona _meta_end_dot_

 raising questions about his campaign finance activities or his evasive answers only reminds them of her terrible record on both fronts _meta_end_dot_

 this is not wise strategy _meta_end_dot_

 but even her more policy orientated criticisms are problematic _meta_end_dot_

 is a debate over whose health care plan includes a universal mandate really going to change voter s minds _meta_end_question_

 will people believe that obama is a closet moderate based on his voting present in the illinois senate _meta_end_question_

 a much more plausible motivation is emotional rather than tactical _meta_end_dot_

 obama really gets under hillary s skin and her natural instinct is to hit back and hard _meta_end_dot_

 democratic partisans also believe that failing to respond to attacks is what doomed john kerry in the last election _meta_end_dot_

 when this widespread belief is combined with hillary s long history of wanting to ruthlessly attack her opponents it creates a powerful desire to abandon the rose garden style and turn to hand to hand combat _meta_end_dot_

 but she lacks the charm and skill needed to go negative without seeming harsh and vindictive _meta_end_dot_

 when hillary responds forcefully or goes on the offensive her voice tends to rise and gains an often grating edge _meta_end_dot_

 the attack seems personal and off putting _meta_end_dot_

 while voters often respond to attempts to lay out clear differences between candidates in stark or hard hitting terms they recoil from attacks that seem too harsh or personal _meta_end_dot_

 the dilemma for hillary is that her early position as the clear national frontrunner and above the fray campaign style has been challenged by a string of polls showing her losing ground in key early states like iowa and new hampshire despite retaining large leads in national polls _meta_end_dot_

 the fear is that a loss in iowa could shatter her frontrunner image and once the dam breaks all bets are off _meta_end_dot_

 the current tone of the campaign reflects the high stakes nature of the primaries and hillary s uncomfortable choices now that the aura of invincibility has been shattered _meta_end_dot_

 despite protestations to the contrary there simply aren t that many policy differences between the candidates _meta_end_dot_

 and despite her claims hillary really doesn t have a great deal more experience than her rivals _meta_end_dot_

 her campaign was always based on her celebrity status and nostalgia for her husband s time in office _meta_end_dot_

 when the campaign was about her large national lead and her campaign s discipline she was able to rise above it all _meta_end_dot_

 when her rivals turned their attacks on her directly however the temptation to respond proved too much _meta_end_dot_

 but this change in tactics doesn t play to her strengths but her weaknesses _meta_end_dot_

 it puts the spotlight on her personality and risks solidifying her perception as the candidate of the ugly debates of the past _meta_end_dot_

 enter obama the idealist or edwards the populist _meta_end_dot_

 hillary recently told audiences in iowa that she wanted more than a one night stand but a long term relationship it seems however that the reality of that long term commitment is beginning to sink in to voters as they see the less than charming side of their suitor _meta_end_dot_

 let s hope they are smart enough to call off the engagement _meta_end_dot_
