  you ve heard the democrat s message _meta_end_dot_

 john mccain is john mcsame _meta_end_dot_

 third bush term _meta_end_dot_

 blah blah blah _meta_end_dot_

 it is dishonest but barack obama and the dnc don t have a problem with that _meta_end_dot_

 but today barack broke the talking point _meta_end_dot_

 what did he say _meta_end_question_

 according to ap s liz sidoti politico s ben smith describes this as a break with the core of the democratic party s strategy but you know it s tough when the core democratic party strategy is to convince the public of something that even democratic candidates don t believe _meta_end_dot_

 back to the drawing board _meta_end_dot_

 and try to be honest this time _meta_end_dot_

 if you know how _meta_end_dot_
