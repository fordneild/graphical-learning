  welcome to the song irving berlin apropos of george mcgovern s this from an op ed in sundays washington post scratching your head _meta_end_question_

 well don t _meta_end_dot_

 george mcgovern is still fighting yesterday s war read on george hasn t been reading the news _meta_end_dot_

 the news _meta_end_dot_

 the news from he who is to know _meta_end_dot_

 you know i would advocate the impeachment of the hypothetical president mcgovern but he had his clock cleaned by dick nixon in _meta_number_ref_ before he could be _meta_end_dot_

 how metaphysical _meta_end_exclamation_

 george s solution _meta_end_question_

 vote for the party of doubt fear and concession of defeat if rational meant rational to george nancy harry hillary byrd etc _meta_end_dot_

 wouldn t have a place in the congress of the old man s dreams _meta_end_dot_

 neither would such irrational sorts as carter clinton bill barry hillary edwards or richardson be eligible for election _meta_end_dot_

 why _meta_end_question_

 because to be rational one must not be ruled by anti war passions which convert judgment into sneering _meta_end_dot_

 but the mcgovernicks they ll sing g night and god bless _meta_end_dot_
