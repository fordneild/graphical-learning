  sorry _meta_end_dot_

 geek joke _meta_end_dot_

 anyway he s set it up so that you can crunch the numbers of the remaining primary races to see what the eventual vote totals will be in the democratic primary _meta_end_dot_

 it looks pretty good but to be honest while it s a lot of work that jay did here and i m glad that he s given me a new toy to play with it s still just a toy _meta_end_dot_

 the race has passed from being decided by the voters senator obama s inability to close the sale by nailing down enough pledged delegates to win the nomination has ensured that and gone to being eventually decided by almost _meta_number_ref_ people most of which aren t known all that well outside of their circles and not a few of whom aren t really known at all _meta_end_dot_

 and enthusiasms of either democratic faction aside their task is not going to be endorse the people s will by anointing their true candidate it s going to be cut away as little living flesh as possible while debriding the wound yeah good luck with that guys _meta_end_dot_

 you re going to need it _meta_end_dot_
