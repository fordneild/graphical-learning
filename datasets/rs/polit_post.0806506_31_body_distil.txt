  i will confess that i thought after tonight hillary clinton would be a goner _meta_end_dot_

 we all heard that barack obama was making huge gains in both ohio and texas and for all i know if the race were held a few days later he might have won it _meta_end_dot_

 but it was not held a few days later _meta_end_dot_

 it was held on tuesday night and hillary clinton won _meta_end_dot_

 as brother lane makes clear in his own inimitable way hillary clinton s wins in texas and ohio will only serve to prolong the fight for the democratic nomination _meta_end_dot_

 this will exhaust the candidates exhaust their resources and make it that much harder for democrats to eventually unite for the fall campaign _meta_end_dot_

 meanwhile republicans will have time to coalesce around john mccain who won the nomination by sweeping through texas ohio rhode island and vermont _meta_end_dot_

 a united republican party now looks to be more and more a likelihood _meta_end_dot_

 as for the democrats _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 well _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 see the title of this post _meta_end_dot_

 if emperor palpatine was around he would advise both hillary clinton and barack obama to let the hate flow through them and let it nourish them _meta_end_dot_

 they will have little problem doing so it is clear that neither clinton nor obama like one another _meta_end_dot_

 lightsabers will be lit anon _meta_end_dot_

 and hands are gonna get cut off in the duel _meta_end_dot_
