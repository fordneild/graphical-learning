  jeff emanuel detailed the _meta_dollor_ref_ billion tax increase on oil companies that the democratic controlled house pushed through early last week _meta_end_dot_

 buried in that bill was a little publicized gift to venezuelan dictator international pariah and bush basher extraordinaire hugo chavez _meta_end_dot_

 chavez s citgo which he regularly uses like a personal pr firm with its offers of cheap heating oil to economically underprivileged communities from the people of venezuela was exempted from the tax increase imposed on the other major oil companies because it does not get its oil from within the united states _meta_end_dot_

 all of citgo s supply is furnished by venezuela s state owned oil company _meta_end_dot_

 meanwhile chavez is menacing colombia over that country s pursuit of marxist rebels into neighboring ecuador _meta_end_dot_

 chavez has massed troops on the border closed commerce between the two countries except for perishables and has called colombia the israel of latin america among other less attention grabbing insults _meta_end_dot_

 colombia is an ally of the united states in both the war on terror and the war on drugs and has been fighting on both fronts simultaneously in its battle with the narco terrorist rebel group farc _meta_end_dot_

 it was a farc leader that colombian forces killed at his camp inside ecuador the very same one to whom chavez had recently pledged _meta_dollor_ref_ million in aid according to evidence found on the dead terrorist s computer the colombian government has announced _meta_end_dot_

 where might hugo chavez get that kind of money to lavish on terrorist groups in neighboring democratic countries _meta_end_question_

 from venezuela s vast oil wealth perhaps _meta_end_question_

 the same oil wealth that the democratic congress just voted to protect by exempting citgo the venezuelan supplied oil company from a tax increase imposed on oil companies operating in america _meta_end_question_

 surely that can t be _meta_end_dot_

 oh it can and more _meta_end_dot_

 at the same time democrats are tossing bouquets in the form of tax exemptions at chavez they are blocking colombia from receiving valuable economic benefits by refusing to discuss let alone pass the colombia free trade agreement _meta_end_dot_

 read on today s wall street journal reports sub _meta_end_dot_

 req that senate finance committee chairman max baucus d mt and house ways and means committee chairman charlie rangel d ny both warned the white house not to even send the colombia fta up to capitol hill without the acquiescence of the democratic leadership _meta_end_dot_

 rangel offered the following helpful explanation of the democrats position _meta_end_dot_

 so in other words rangel supports colombia he really does but the voters are spooked about free trade agreements right now and gosh it s just so difficult for democrats to act on principle when there s an election afoot _meta_end_dot_

 of course rangel baucus and the democratic leadership in congress are far more concerned with appeasing their union and anti trade left wing base than they are with helping an important ally _meta_end_dot_

 and they don t care which dictators they have to climb in bed with to do it _meta_end_dot_
