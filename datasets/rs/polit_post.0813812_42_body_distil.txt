  china backs up the burma leadership s refusals to allow foreign aid workers to enter the country _meta_end_dot_

 the burmese generals want our food and our equipment but not our people _meta_end_dot_

 obviously because they don t want their own people to have any contact with the outside world _meta_end_dot_

 might lead to calls for a leadership change you see _meta_end_dot_

 can t have that _meta_end_dot_

 china s position is a standard one they have taken for decades no nation especially not those do gooding americans has the right to interfere in the internal affairs of another obviously because the chinese leadership is awfully sensitive about when foreigners read us try to infect their own people with crazy notions about freedom and democracy _meta_end_dot_

 of course china has never hesitated to interfere in the internal affairs of other states when it serves their interests _meta_end_dot_

 but let s not be pointing fingers here the noteworthy thing about this is that china is no longer hesitant to raise their voice and speak up about this in international forums like the un and elsewhere _meta_end_dot_

 obviously they re trying to increase the size of their footprint in global affairs _meta_end_dot_

 not to put too fine a point on it but this is ground on which we need to be competing against the chinese and not only because their position is morally wrong _meta_end_dot_

 the rest of the world is constantly watching for signs of who the heavyweight champ of soft power really is _meta_end_dot_
