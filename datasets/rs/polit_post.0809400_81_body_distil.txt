  note the use of the word should via constant reader fatimabrown we see this link of jane fonda announcing her support of senator barack obama in the upcoming elections _meta_end_dot_

 fonda as all people know and all decent people admit is an actress who used her celebrity to first voluntarily engage in propaganda attacks by the north vietnamese against the united states of america and then as snopes put it i need hardly note that among these supposed war criminals was future senator and presidential candidate john mccain _meta_end_dot_

 now i will not bother with expecting _meta_end_dot_

 people _meta_end_dot_

 like jane fonda to regret or even comprehend the evil that they did _meta_end_dot_

 but i very much would like to know whether senator obama has the integrity to reject the support of a woman who was as much a part of john mccain s torture as the men who smashed rifle butts into john mccain s teeth _meta_end_dot_

 i would like to know but somehow i doubt that i will _meta_end_dot_

 well formally at least _meta_end_dot_

 silence has its own message to convey _meta_end_dot_

 moe lane and before you say a word she regrets being photographed on that aa gun _meta_end_dot_

 which means that the _meta_end_dot_

 woman _meta_end_dot_

 is only sorry that she got in trouble for it _meta_end_dot_

 she ll go to her grave before she admits that she was wrong _meta_end_dot_
