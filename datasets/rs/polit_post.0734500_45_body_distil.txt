  few words quoth she shall fit the trespass best in me more woes than words are now depending to tell them all with one poor tired tongue the story of the rape of jamie leigh jones filed by abc s brian ross on this weekend s _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ is a sad tale indeed _meta_end_dot_

 it is tragic and it is moving _meta_end_dot_

 but for anyone who knows any woman who has worked in the green zone either under the protection of the department of state or as a contractor it is not at all surprising _meta_end_dot_

 i personally know three young women who have worked in this environment not even including my sister who has experienced it as well _meta_end_dot_

 the stories they have told me of conditions for females in the green zone are disturbing at best _meta_end_dot_

 there are universal similarities in what they describe a dominant boy s club atmosphere a fraternity but with guns and more men desperate for an outlet so few women and many of them young attractive and unattached flimsy locks on their quarters and in many circumstances local nationals walking unescorted but don t you dare complain to the embassy we all know what happens then _meta_end_dot_

 it is an ideal atmosphere for the conditions that lead to tragic events attacks like the one that jamie leigh claims happened to her _meta_end_dot_

 read on _meta_end_dot_

 not every claim of rape is true we all know that _meta_end_dot_

 but in this case jamie leigh is making a claim that quite frankly sounds realistic to me _meta_end_dot_

 this is no duke lacrosse situation from every report i ve found her story has not wavered for two years _meta_end_dot_

 texas congressman ted poe a supporter of the war knows her family and takes this case very seriously jockeying with the state department over the treatment of a constituent _meta_end_dot_

 i have no idea whether or not halliburton did the right thing in this case but there have been past events with kbr that make me consider their apparent actions unsurprising _meta_end_dot_

 the idea that a woman would not come forward for fear of losing the very large kbr paycheck is not at all out of the question _meta_end_dot_

 kbr has tried to regulate the crazed atmosphere somewhat restricting employees with curfews rules about alcohol and co ed activity and the like but it is extremely difficult to enforce such restrictions _meta_end_dot_

 and the idea that a rape kit would be taken and then misplaced is not at all surprising when you consider the infamously lax attitude at the embassy medical clinic where patients are routinely discussed in front of other patients and samples aren t even locked up _meta_end_dot_

 the word from my female friends who have all served in this environment is completely consistent and can be characterized by one statement i m surprised this hasn t happened sooner given all of this the fact that two writers i respect ace and rusty have taken to already questioning this case as if it was some trumped up anti bushco charge when there is absolutely no evidence to support such a theory except their own perceptions is particularly saddening to me _meta_end_dot_

 this is a report from brian ross not michael moore _meta_end_dot_

 it is depressing when the immediate knee jerk reaction to a sad case like this by those you consider allies is to view it solely through the prism of their political views _meta_end_dot_

 yes of course the anti war left will doubtlessly use this just as they have and will use all other cases of rape and mistreatment of women in iraq _meta_end_dot_

 they will treat this story as if it is unique to this conflict as opposed to it being something that has taken place in almost every conflict in the modern era _meta_end_dot_

 they will continue to ignore the fact that muslim women outside the green zone were frequently subjected to far worse treatment and had even fewer rights and no ability to respond with the force of the law _meta_end_dot_

 all this is true _meta_end_dot_

 but the fact that our political enemies will use this story does not mean it is a lie nor does it mean you can dismiss it offhand merely as bad television please at least hold back on your snark in at least one case _meta_end_dot_

 at least reserve judgment rather than if you are incorrect slandering an innocent woman who has been treated brutally and deserves far better _meta_end_dot_

 there is nothing to be gained by your snark _meta_end_dot_

 this case will play out in a court of law unlike beauchamp or any other fabricator from the front the truth will out and then you can say your piece _meta_end_dot_

 i know it is not in the nature of the blogosphere to exercise responsibility i wish in this case they would _meta_end_dot_

 here s the truth according to my friends women who are working in the green zone even non contractors are particularly careful to never walk anywhere alone _meta_end_dot_

 not because they are worried about being bombed or attacked by the enemy they are worried about the men who are there _meta_end_dot_

 men who are supposed to be their fellow comrades and friends who are supposed to treat them with respect but instead are ever present threats _meta_end_dot_

 so try for a moment to understand that not everything in iraq is flowers and candy and that sometimes american men do terrible things and american companies let people slip through the cracks _meta_end_dot_

 we make men without chests and expect virtue and enterprise it would not be the first time nor the last _meta_end_dot_

 for my own part i hope against hope that jamie leigh jones story is not true _meta_end_dot_

 but if her story is true i pray her attackers are found and punished and those who enabled them are made to pay dearly for their mistake _meta_end_dot_

 and if they are not found i hope that the vile act they engaged in makes them prisoners to sin their guilt weighs like hot coals on their skulls and their infamy haunts them to the end of their days _meta_end_dot_
