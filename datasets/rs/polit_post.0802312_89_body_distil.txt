  it is often said that the job of conservatives is merely to slow down the inexorable march of liberalism and in large part history has taught us that this is correct _meta_end_dot_

 secularism humanism egalitarianism and socialism have marched unflinchingly forward for the last two centuries and all conservatives have to show for their efforts is the the fact that in some places the advance has been stalled or slowed _meta_end_dot_

 most disheartening of all we have seen that when liberalism gains ground it rarely if ever gives it up _meta_end_dot_

 and so _meta_number_ref_ years after the greatest judicial abomination handed down in this country since scott v _meta_end_dot_

 sanford we should have every reason to believe that the fight over legalized abortion should by now be a footnote in history yet another chapter closed with here conservatives stood their ground but inevitably lost and yet here in america at least we have found that something in the human condition refuses to let this particular fight go and we are hopeful for good reason that the cause may not ultimately be lost forever _meta_end_dot_

 read on _meta_end_dot_

 i have previously catalogued here at redstate that the public has become less not more tolerant of legalized abortion in the _meta_number_ref_ years since roe v _meta_end_dot_

 wade which is the exact opposite effect one would have expected especially given the dramatic uptick in public support for legalized abortion after the roe v _meta_end_dot_

 wade decision _meta_end_dot_

 the average citizen does not like to think that his country is unjust or that legalized atrocities might be committed within his own borders and so he tends especially after a measure of time to believe that the laws as they currently exist are as they should be _meta_end_dot_

 and so we should expect that decades of exposure to legalized abortion should have generated more public acceptance of the phenomenon _meta_end_dot_

 but indeed they have not and in fact the opposite has occurred _meta_end_dot_

 why has this been the case _meta_end_question_

 why in this area alone has liberalism had to fight for three and a half decades to preserve the same territory with small sections of lost territory along the way _meta_end_question_

 well in this case science has something to do with it _meta_end_dot_

 although generally not an optimist about human nature i believe that at the very least humans will reject the notion that a mother should have carte blanche to kill her own children regardless of how small they are or where they reside _meta_end_dot_

 and science has been able to show us in increasing detail that the unborn child is exactly that a child human small and growing and located within her mother s womb _meta_end_dot_

 and so we continue to resist the idea forced upon us by a prideful and stubborn supreme court that the constitution a document written over _meta_number_ref_ years ago by men who surely never considered the idea demands that this unmitigated slaughter continue _meta_end_dot_

 and we are not unaware of the significance of the fact that our elected president the man with the largest bully pulpit in the world himself commemorated the date of a judicial travesty by strongly condemning it and standing with solidarity on the side of life _meta_end_dot_

 yesterday untold masses marched in our nation s capital as they do every year to remind the supreme court that this issue will not disappear no matter how much time passes _meta_end_dot_

 they marched to protest the fact that their democratic voices had been inexorably silenced by the fiat edict of a supreme court which childishly declared _meta_number_ref_ years ago that roe v _meta_end_dot_

 wade must not be overturned lest the court appear to have been made weak by political pressure _meta_end_dot_

 justice scalia s words from that decision ring true yet today take note justice kennedy of the words of your intellectual and moral superior _meta_end_dot_

 we are not impressed with your insipid reflections upon shoes nor the meaning of life and so long as the imperial court lives we shall continue to march in rejection of the erroneous value judgment you have imposed upon this country _meta_end_dot_

 it may be that even within our lifetimes we will eventually witness the final destruction of the institutions that have made western civilization endure these many centuries and liberalism will have then had its final victory when western civilization as such is destroyed _meta_end_dot_

 but it appears that this ground at least the ground upon which over _meta_number_ref_ million innocent human lives have been lost will not be surrendered either now or in the near future _meta_end_dot_

 we ll see you at the march next year _meta_end_dot_

 and we ll hope that a president will speak to us there yet again _meta_end_dot_
