  all it took was the sudden need to explain away a six point loss by this year s fresh faced outsider who will breathe new life into the race and get ordinary people excited about politics again i should standardize this god knows the democrats run one of these poor sobs into the ground every four years yes obama won nevada bowers will no doubt follow this up with a curse upon your mothers ye mockers _meta_end_exclamation_

 obama won nevada_meta_beep_ref_ _meta_end_exclamation_

 or something else along those lines _meta_end_dot_

 well everybody needs a hobby particularly when the alternative is watching your candidate get metaphorically garroted with a silken bowstring _meta_end_dot_

 read on _meta_end_dot_

 if you re wondering what s going on bowers didn t really bother to explain it what happened was that some delegates were wait let me put up the green paper summary as you can see there were a mix of districts with odd and even numbers of delegates _meta_end_dot_

 clinton won districts with even numbers of delegates but not by enough to make the total _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ meanwhile obama won the odd numbered delegate districts which gave him the majority of delegates in each _meta_end_dot_

 thus he walks away with a technical one delegate victory this is complicated of course by the wrinkle that the results are unofficial anyway _meta_end_dot_

 why does this matter _meta_end_question_

 well it doesn t except in both the above academic sense and a vicious amusement one _meta_end_dot_

 it s hard to blame the obama acolytes for trying to lipstick the pig after all they ve got all that audacity of hope renewal of america finding the grail agitprop to justify _meta_end_dot_

 so talking about how they really and truly did win nevada if you just turn your head and squint certainly beats explaining just how it was possible for senator hillary clinton to casually reach out with a fighting spur and disembowel their paladin _meta_end_dot_

 plus it s kind of neat to see any member of the left torch one of their cherished shibboleths in this case the essential wrongness of the _meta_number_ref_ election results for short term gain _meta_end_dot_

 although i would like to note for the record that there is one major difference sorry but senator barack obama simply isn t good enough at politics to justify being compared to us _meta_end_dot_

 you see while we of course were aiming for a popular vote majority paying attention to the electoral college was the gop s back up plan which is another way of saying that we didn t win _meta_number_ref_ by accident _meta_end_dot_

 mind you issues involving his candidacy are rapidly becoming academic anyway _meta_end_dot_
