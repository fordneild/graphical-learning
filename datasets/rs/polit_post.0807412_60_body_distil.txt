  bill keller executive editor of the new york times is trying to use his paper s spitzmas story to lend credence to its recent john mccain contrivance the mccain piece turned out to be an empty attack inference and innuendo rather than news while the spitzer piece blew the lid off a personal and political fraud _meta_end_dot_

 you cannot use a recent success to justify past idiocy _meta_end_dot_

 but i can just image pinch and keller printing whatever garbage they want and when they re called on it insisting well remember we broke the spitzer story this would be fine if time old gray drunk lady would stick to reporting the news leaving the political opinion to their editorial page _meta_end_dot_
