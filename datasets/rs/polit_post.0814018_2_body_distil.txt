  behold i shall make a totally unfounded prediction barack obama will win the popular vote by a margin larger than gore s _meta_end_dot_

 he will nevertheless lose the electoral college vote by more than _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 i think that obama might rack up some huge wins in liberal states larger than gore s or kerry s _meta_end_dot_

 but i think he also might lose oh pa and fl which makes it almost impossible for him to win the electoral college _meta_end_dot_

 just a gut feeling of course _meta_end_dot_

 anyway open thread _meta_end_dot_
