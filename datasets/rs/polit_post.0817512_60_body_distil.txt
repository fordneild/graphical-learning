  the supreme court s term is likely to end this wednesay or thursday _meta_end_dot_

 i noted last thursday with the usual cautions about this kind of thing scotusblog s observation that justice scalia was the most likely justice to be writing the court s opinion in dc v _meta_end_dot_

 heller given that only he and justice souter had yet to write majority opinions from cases the court heard in march _meta_end_dot_

 well this morning the court handed down the other remaining case from the march sitting and it was written by justice souter _meta_end_dot_

 so the odds would seem now to strongly favor justice scalia _meta_end_dot_

 how good is that news for fans of the second amendment _meta_end_question_

 well it s unlikely that a scalia opinion will be a bad one when an express provision of the constitution is involved but bear in mind that _meta_number_ref_ even if he does write the opinion there s no guarantee that it will be a majority opinion it could be a plurality that leaves matters more unsettled than ever e g _meta_number_ref_ justices favoring a strong individual right _meta_number_ref_ supporting dc s position and _meta_number_ref_ usually justice kennedy under the court s current alignment refusing to join either side s analysis and _meta_number_ref_ it s very possible that the court will decide only the scope of the right against federal interference under the unique legal status of the district of columbia and won t address the thornier issue of whether the second amendment prohibits gun control measures by state governments _meta_end_dot_

 and of course the guesswork could simply be wrong even if justice scalia was originally assigned the opinion it could end up as a dissent if some justices changed their minds before it was finalized _meta_end_dot_

 in other words we can guess all we like but until we see the opinion we can t know _meta_end_dot_
