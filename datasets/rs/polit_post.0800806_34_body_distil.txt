  i agree with a lot of people who laud barack obama for actually trying to engage in dialogue with those who disagree with him on policy issues _meta_end_dot_

 would that more people were able to talk to the other side in so civilized a manner perhaps certain portions of our national discourse would not be so utterly toxic _meta_end_dot_

 at the same time michael o hanlon properly points out that this new tone does not seem to find its way to being included in obama s rhetoric on iraq _meta_end_dot_

 read on _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 o hanlon is one of those who fits in easily with the the bush administration displays an arrogant bunker mentality crowd so it is not as if he is some oh let s use the smear of the age neoconservative shill for war _meta_end_dot_

 and he raises a good point _meta_end_dot_

 it is fine and good for barack obama to have the views he has on iraq _meta_end_dot_

 no one begrudges him his opinion _meta_end_dot_

 but it would be nice if he acknowledged that people like o hanlon and those affiliated with him had a point in being concerned about iraq _meta_end_dot_

 and it would be even nicer if he finally acknowledged that the surge is succeeding and that perhaps just perhaps talk of a swift withdrawal ought to be shunted to the side _meta_end_dot_
