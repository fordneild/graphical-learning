  i realize that i beat up on neo protectionists and neo mercantilists a great deal _meta_end_dot_

 but here s the thing they deserve it _meta_end_dot_

 their arguments have no valuable intellectual content whatsoever are wholly devoid of facts and indeed are allergic to any attempt to introduce a dose of reality _meta_end_dot_

 greg mankiw explains why facts _meta_end_dot_

 they are facts that smart people intimately familiar with the details surrounding trade policy take as givens much as they take the revolution of the earth around the sun as a given _meta_end_dot_

 they are also facts that by and large are kept away from the public by demagogues like lou dobbs and by the democratic candidates for president of the united states and what appears to be the great majority of their fellow democrats _meta_end_dot_

 this attempt to deprive the general debate of valuable and needed facts will if unchecked lead to bad policymaking _meta_end_dot_

 and that will lead to a reversal in the many extremely considerable prosperity gains that we have achieved thanks to free trade _meta_end_dot_

 i write all of this so that hopefully readers understand the origins and nature of my passion on the issue of free trade _meta_end_dot_

 free trade is too important an issue to leave to populist demagogues to monopolize _meta_end_dot_

 the only way the neo protectionists and neo mercantilists can win the debate on trade is if free traders do not make a genuine effort to give the public the facts on the issue of trade _meta_end_dot_

 absent those facts the forces of economic ignorance stand a very good chance of causing the policymaking process to go awry _meta_end_dot_

 but if the general public is in the know when it comes to the facts the know nothings of the _meta_number_ref_st century won t stand a chance _meta_end_dot_
