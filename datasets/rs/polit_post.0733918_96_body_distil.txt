  for middle schoolers _meta_end_dot_

 you want to get _meta_number_ref_ to _meta_number_ref_ year olds to work overtime hours for community service _meta_end_dot_

 no really _meta_end_dot_

 from mark halperin and senator obama s own site we can see that this is an actual proposed goal screenshots here and here _meta_end_dot_

 and to be fair a contradictory pdf read on _meta_end_dot_

 ed morrissey is kind enough to suggest that this was obama s people being sloppy h t by the way _meta_end_dot_

 very likely lord knows that while we ve heard much of the greatness of obama s character personality drive charisma and general resemblance to the messiah we have not heard overmuch about the greatness of his organizational skills _meta_end_dot_

 so i suppose that it s possible or even probable that his team didn t mean to make their candidate sound like he was about to advocate policies that would warm the heart of a _meta_number_ref_th century robber baron _meta_end_dot_

 but let s say that the idea was really to encourage _meta_number_ref_ hours a year _meta_end_dot_

 here are two questions from where i m sitting i figure that i could answer question _meta_number_ref_ in a way that would please senator obama s staff _meta_end_dot_

 but darned if all the reasonable answers to question _meta_number_ref_ don t reflect badly on their candidate _meta_end_dot_

 and shoot i haven t even looked at the rest of the proposal yet _meta_end_dot_
