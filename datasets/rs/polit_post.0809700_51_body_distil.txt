  in the event that there are some who wonder why it is that the results of the recent presidential election in zimbabwe have not yet been released consider the following passage from this article could be the precursor to a rigged result _meta_end_question_

 i think that it is safe to say that there is an active effort on the part of mugabe and his cohorts to rig the result _meta_end_dot_

 we can dare to say as much without qualification at this point _meta_end_dot_
