  this is extrapolated from notes that i took at the time _meta_end_dot_

 i only wish that i had taken a little more time on the details _meta_end_dot_

 it was pretty much a typical morning in iraq _meta_end_dot_

 we had been up all night hunting tangos in saddam city now sadr city _meta_end_dot_

 we had found a cache of iraqi top secret documents with a large smoking pile of ashes in the center of a room _meta_end_dot_

 while i can t say precisely what they all said a quick perusal of one of them had a lot to say about the french government and how they were involved with saddam _meta_end_dot_

 we moved them all over to the the exploitation tf and headed back toward the green zone to give some detailed info to the iraq survey group _meta_end_dot_

 read on on the way we passed near the ministry of health and found a dead tango draped off of a balcony along the street _meta_end_dot_

 wtf _meta_end_question_

 there was a bunch of blood on the street and we knew that someone had been hit _meta_end_dot_

 everyone was tired _meta_end_dot_

 we knew it wasn t us but the bad guy still had blood dripping off of him so we must have just missed the action _meta_end_dot_

 i started asking around and here is what happened _meta_end_dot_

 that morning a senior civil affairs team tasked with rebuilding the iraq ministry of health from the ground up was on their way to the ministry buildings _meta_end_dot_

 apparently this is a trip that they had to make regularly _meta_end_dot_

 remember that the invasion had just occurred but baghdad was quiet for the most part _meta_end_dot_

 normally the team had an escort of mps but they weren t available that day _meta_end_dot_

 the medical team leader was a reserve colonel by the name of bob frame _meta_end_dot_

 he was the right choice as he had done the same job in afghanistan and in his day job was a deputy under secretary in the va _meta_end_dot_

 all the right connections _meta_end_dot_

 he decided that the mission was too important and that it was worth the risk _meta_end_dot_

 up armored hmmwvs weren t around much then _meta_end_dot_

 speed was your best security _meta_end_dot_

 he was the passenger in the trail vehicle _meta_end_dot_

 also on the team and in the lead vehicle was colonel butch andersen an sf medic in a previous life he went on to get an m d _meta_end_dot_

 and was a swat surgeon in his day life _meta_end_dot_

 his skills would be sorely needed that day _meta_end_dot_

 major bob donovan was an army nurse _meta_end_dot_

 it escapes me what he did by day but i suspect that it was nursing _meta_end_dot_

 i believe that bob was driving the first vehicle _meta_end_dot_

 specialist jason lange was driving the second hmmwv and was likely ca medic _meta_end_dot_

 there as also an iraqi m d _meta_end_dot_

 who was a translator team member in one of the vehicles _meta_end_dot_

 as they were driving to the ministry of education for a critical meeting an iraqi saw the target of opportunity appear to him in the form of two unarmored vehicles _meta_end_dot_

 he stepped out on his balcony and opened fire down into the convoy with an ak _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 every single person was hit as the people in the street scattered _meta_end_dot_

 doc frame a dentist was shot through the left arm which was left hanging by a tendon _meta_end_dot_

 he immediately went into shock and was bleeding out _meta_end_dot_

 doc anderson was shot in the left forearm _meta_end_dot_

 doc donovan was shot into the shoulder and through his back from above _meta_end_dot_

 spc lange was shot in the leg _meta_end_dot_

 the iraqi doc was shot in the chest _meta_end_dot_

 apparently doc anderson was the first to act as the convoy stopped _meta_end_dot_

 he jumped out of the vehicle as the tango was reloading his ak _meta_end_dot_

 the tango began to re engage as doc anderson took a knee gained a good sight picture with the m _meta_number_ref_ he insisted that he carry and took the son of a bitch down _meta_end_dot_

 he took a moment to assess whether there were additional threats _meta_end_dot_

 he didn t see any _meta_end_dot_

 he them immediately sprinted around ignoring his own wound made worse by handling his m _meta_number_ref_ and conducted a hasty triage _meta_end_dot_

 doc frame was easily the worst at first glance _meta_end_dot_

 he applied a tourniquet placed frame back into the passenger seat and went around to check doc donovan _meta_end_dot_

 donovan was in bad shape but it wasn t easy to see the extent of the injuries through the flak jackets they were issued _meta_end_dot_

 donovan said that he was okay to drive but was clearly out of it _meta_end_dot_

 anderson told him to head for the nearest u s _meta_end_dot_

 check point they had passed but to wait for the rest of the team _meta_end_dot_

 in his poor state donovan only heard the first part of that communication _meta_end_dot_

 he spun the wheel throwing frame out of the hmmwv and did as he was told _meta_end_dot_

 he was bleeding out and didn t notice that he was now the only person in the vehicle _meta_end_dot_

 doc anderson also didn t notice that the other hmmwv had taken off and applied a hasty tourniquet to spc lange _meta_end_dot_

 the iraqi doc had a tough to treat hole in his chest _meta_end_dot_

 it wasn t a sucking chest wound i think and he decided that they needed to get to the nearest u s _meta_end_dot_

 military hospital _meta_end_dot_

 at this point the iraqi civilians had come out and were trying to help _meta_end_dot_

 it was the iraqis who picked up doc frames limp body and carried him to anderson _meta_end_dot_

 damn _meta_end_exclamation_

 with everyone now loaded up they headed to out to find help _meta_end_dot_

 nobody died that day except the tango _meta_end_dot_

 frame donovan and lange were medevaced back to the states _meta_end_dot_

 the iraqi doctor was eventually taken to an iraqi hospital and fully recovered _meta_end_dot_

 doc anderson got himself fixed and returned to take over the team that had just been decimated _meta_end_dot_

 the team members who hadn t been on the convoy were likely upset about not being there i know the feeling _meta_end_dot_

 the mission went on and by all accounts went a long way toward rebuilding the tertiary care system in baghdad _meta_end_dot_

 i can t say where things are now _meta_end_dot_

 likely the mahdi guys control the hospitals now _meta_end_dot_

 i m sure that bribes get treatment and meds _meta_end_dot_

 but iraq is graduating twice the number of m d s that they were pre invasion _meta_end_dot_

 they are learning about procedures that weren t taught under saddam _meta_end_dot_

 they likely have computers something that even computer science majors did not have _meta_end_dot_

 no kidding and have dreams of research and cures _meta_end_dot_

 at least one segment of iraq seems ready to become more than itself _meta_end_dot_

 thanks docs _meta_end_dot_

 you done good _meta_end_dot_
