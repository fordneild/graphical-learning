  trying to lock up the _meta_number_ref_ nomination barack obama sent one of his most prominent lobbyist allies to help convince puerto ricans to vote for him _meta_end_dot_

 if you believed that whole shtick about this fellow as the bearer of a new kind of politics one that rejected the typical washington centric choices of the past well good for you _meta_end_dot_

 you re an optimist _meta_end_dot_

 rock on _meta_end_dot_

 invest in pork bellies _meta_end_dot_

 and yeah i m sure hd dvd and betamax will make a comeback _meta_end_dot_

 obama likes lobbyists _meta_end_dot_

 they re likable people _meta_end_dot_

 they re paid to be likable in fact _meta_end_dot_

 obama has tons of lobbyists hanging around his campaign giving him money whispering in his ears _meta_end_dot_

 we all knew that _meta_end_dot_

 but this is something more _meta_end_dot_

 obama s co director for his entire campaign in puerto rico it turns out is a beltway based federal lobbyist _meta_end_dot_

 not just a little lobbying no someone who s made millions doing nothing but lobbying for the past seven years _meta_end_dot_

 and what s more he hasn t even bothered to take a leave of absence from his firm to organize obama s campaign effort in puerto rico _meta_end_dot_

 jeffrey birnbaum at that biased neoconservative source the washington post reports below the fold puerto rico may be new to this whole presidential politics game _meta_end_dot_

 but voters on the island know a hypocrite when they see one _meta_end_dot_

 for all the talk obama advances about changing the political paradigm in washington people are beginning to understand that he s just a chic rebranding of the same old failed policies and broken promises _meta_end_dot_

 and regardless of these voter s lack of history their tolerance for bullcrap just ain t that high _meta_end_dot_
