  when kansas da phill kline found evidence of criminal late term abortions failure to report child rape and missing viability testing records at a local planned parenthood he took action _meta_end_dot_

 that was in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 since then he has faced an uphill battle with the organization which is committed to protecting only their reputation and not the lives of viable unborn babies or the well being of minor children _meta_end_dot_

 in kansas it is illegal to perform an abortion on a viable fetus after _meta_number_ref_ weeks _meta_end_dot_

 but these folks let it slip by _meta_end_dot_

 now planned parenthood is also being accused of forging required documents _meta_end_dot_

 they shamelessly defend themselves of any wrong doing while planned parenthoods across the nation continue these disgusting practices in the name of privacy and a right to choose my article today at human events discusses the many details and most recent standings of this case _meta_end_dot_

 a background article published last month can fill you in the intricacies behind it _meta_end_dot_

 this case is extremely significant because if kline succeeds in charging planned parenthood he sets a precedent for others to more easily uncover the crimes perpetrated by this organization everywhere _meta_end_dot_

 here s the article johnson county kansas da phill kline may become the first to bring down a local planned parenthood operation on a host of criminal charges including failures to report sexual abuse of minors criminal late term abortions and forged records _meta_end_dot_

 the legal wars between planned parenthood of kansas and mid missouri and kline boil down to two simple points first kline alleges and has taken to a grand jury evidence that planned parenthood of kansas and mid missouri routinely fails to report sexual abuse of children and its doctors perform illegal partial birth abortions second that this particular planned parenthood which denies all these charges has with its kansas political and media allies undertaken to discredit and destroy kline _meta_end_dot_

 the grand jury is also considering _meta_number_ref_ charges of false information pp allegedly created to cover their tracks regarding missing viability testing records before abortions were performed _meta_end_dot_

 the facts of this war which is escalating almost daily are complex but worth the space it takes to explain _meta_end_dot_

 kline a pro life crusading da has since _meta_number_ref_ been investigating the johnson county planned parenthood of kansas and mid missouri _meta_end_dot_

 kline says pp has allegedly failed to report child rape or abide by viability testing standards on pre aborted babies in over _meta_number_ref_ instances _meta_end_dot_

 kline says he has discovered evidence of this criminal behavior and more including criminal late term abortions _meta_end_dot_

 the case is outlined in the _meta_number_ref_ criminal charges originating in the _meta_number_ref_ records kline subpoenaed from the pp facility in _meta_number_ref_ most recently on january _meta_number_ref_ kline went before a kansas court in the case against pp on a motion to disqualify their lawyers from the case _meta_end_dot_

 kline planned to use the lawyers as witnesses for the falsified document charges and said he brought the case against them to air out their conflict so that pp is stopped if they are convicted later from claiming they didn t know of the conflict and they have ineffective assistance of counsel however judge stephen r _meta_end_dot_

 tatum determined lawyers pedro irigonegaray and robert eye would not be witnesses for kline s case _meta_end_dot_

 he denied the motion enabling them to continue representing pp _meta_end_dot_

 despite the failed motion the hearing provided a platform for kline to present critical evidence in the falsified document charges _meta_end_dot_

 kline presented more evidence that pp had forged their viability testing documents _meta_end_dot_

 he proved it by calling shawnee county district judge richard andersen who authorized kline s original case to subpoena records in _meta_number_ref_ to testify _meta_end_dot_

 andersen had two physicians review the records _meta_end_dot_

 they found the required testing was missing _meta_end_dot_

 in kansas abortions are prohibited after _meta_number_ref_ weeks of pregnancy save for the mother s life or severe harm to her health and this must be documented _meta_end_dot_

 pp lawyers presented notes on viability testing eventually after andersen s testimony but andersen and kline both agreed those notes appeared forged _meta_end_dot_

 on his own accord andersen consulted a handwriting expert in the police department who determined handwriting samples did not match _meta_end_dot_

 this evidence was enlarged on posters for the courtroom _meta_end_dot_

 if the false information charges are true they are a felony _meta_end_dot_

 kline said in a meeting on last tuesday that pp is putting up a vociferous and aggressive fight to prevent the truth from surfacing _meta_end_dot_

 when i spoke with jenn giroux director of women influencing the nation after the january _meta_number_ref_ court date she said the amount of evidence that was put forth was just unbelievable and laid the ground work for the rest of the case kline believes his case is a confrontation of the greatest manifestation of planned parenthood s lie s that s it s unconstitutional to report child rape one of pp s foundational arguments _meta_end_dot_

 pp s position is apparently that it would invade a child s privacy to report rape kline said kansans don t know the truth behind this case because pp and the mainstream media shade the meaning of words and media coverage has been unfavorable _meta_end_dot_

 though kansas has strict standards against performing late third term abortions the state leads the country in number _meta_end_dot_

 if charges like these can be directed at just one facility in kansas thousands of others around the country are likely committing the same crimes _meta_end_dot_

 it s absurd but we have forced them to the point that their philosophy of our constitution comes to that result and they don t want to fight on that hill kline told human events _meta_end_dot_

 kline said at this point he has not expectation because normal rules don t seem to apply in this case _meta_end_dot_

 the next step is a preliminary hearing relating to the felony charges _meta_end_dot_

 there kline s team must put forth sufficient evidence for the judge to grant them a trial _meta_end_dot_

 pp president and chief executive officer peter brownlie according to reports said he is not worried about the charges _meta_end_dot_
