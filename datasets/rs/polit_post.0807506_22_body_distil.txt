  personally i am happy to have general petraeus put pressure on the iraqis to work to achieve greater political reconciliation and to preserve the advances made under the surge _meta_end_dot_

 so i welcome his comments and his stern warnings to the iraqis _meta_end_dot_

 at the same time i am sure he knows just how hard it is for the iraqis after decades of ba athist tyranny to create a functioning democracy and so when he makes his statements on the issue of political reconcilation i know that they are backed up by a healthy sense of perspective _meta_end_dot_

 this differs of course from all of those who simply want to declare the surge a failure say that political reconciliation is impossible and engage in a precipitous withdrawal that will undermine our long term security interests _meta_end_dot_

 general petraeus and those of like mind issue critiques in good faith and with the hope of achieving real success on the political reconciliation front while at the same time pursuing what has been an exceedingly successful counterinsurgency strategy _meta_end_dot_

 others simply want to go home and do not appear to care much what happens when iraq descends into complete chaos in the aftermath of a precipitous withdrawal _meta_end_dot_
