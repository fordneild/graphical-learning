  i m writing this at _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_pm edt on sunday _meta_end_dot_

 it s early monday morning in asia and financial markets there will be open for trading in a few hours _meta_end_dot_

 it s quite likely that by the time you read this the bear stearns companies will either have been acquired by jp morgan chase or will have announced a bankruptcy filing _meta_end_dot_

 the total value of bear stearns s outstanding stock was a bit more than _meta_dollor_ref_ billion at the end of friday _meta_end_dot_

 the company owns a building on madison avenue that is worth a bit more than a billion dollars and more importantly to morgan ceo jamie dimon is a lot nicer looking than jp morgan s building around the corner _meta_end_dot_

 bear also has a prime brokerage business and other assets that are worth maybe another billion _meta_end_dot_

 considering that bear has a stated book value of around _meta_dollor_ref_ a share more than ten billion dollars this acquisition is going to be one of the all time historic fire sales _meta_end_dot_

 what might get in the way _meta_end_question_

 a lot of things _meta_end_dot_

 one of them is that dimon doesn t particularly like bear stearns _meta_end_dot_

 lots of people on wall street don t as a matter of fact _meta_end_dot_

 when bear stearns was a powerhouse they acted like one and didn t worry about the ill will they often generated _meta_end_dot_

 such as in the long term crisis chickens are coming home to roost _meta_end_dot_

 correction in a comment to an earlier post i mentioned that china s government owned a one billion stake in bear stearns through its citic investments entity _meta_end_dot_

 since then i ve learned that this deal has not closed despite a mad dash this week to do so by a bear vice chairman with a close personal tie to the boss of citic _meta_end_dot_

 the chinese are already feeling sheepish after buying into blackstone group _meta_end_dot_

 closing the deal with bear would have made them look like idiots _meta_end_dot_

 stay tuned _meta_end_dot_
