  men who have forgotten more about the earthy rough n tumble of politics than i shall ever know assure me that the device of email blasts occasional notifications sent out to a self selected list of the need for action on specific issues of consequence is a highly useful one _meta_end_dot_

 we re already having an impact with our redstate action emails one of these political savants tells me _meta_end_dot_

 but the bigger the list the more impact we have it has long been a lament of political operatives that conservatives traditionalists libertarians reactionaries populists all the raucous panoply of the american right are peculiarly resistant to the kind of organization that lends itself to success in democratic politics _meta_end_dot_

 some of the reasons for this are plain enough conservatives are more likely than liberals to be busy with private life families businesses churches and to hold public life in a certain disdain _meta_end_dot_

 they are much better at stopping bad things than they are at organizing to achieve good things _meta_end_dot_

 but all this is only true as a generality _meta_end_dot_

 in specific cases it does not apply and i venture to speculate that there are quite a few conservatives out there who though busy indeed would not be averse to occasional activism which is focused and effective _meta_end_dot_

 even the rough n tumble of politics and all its frustrations and indignities may now and then be necessary to vindicate a just cause _meta_end_dot_

 the fact is whatever we may think of the gop s failings we face the real possibility of a party winning control of both the legislative and the executive branches which to saying nothing more does not inspire confidence as to its judgment its patriotism its fortitude in the face of the republic s enemies _meta_end_dot_

 very likely conservatives are going to be called on again to do what they are genuinely good at stopping bad things resisting folly fraud and utopian delusion _meta_end_dot_

 take heart friend this we can do _meta_end_dot_

 contemplate the noble work that a disparate coalition of conservatives has accomplished in the teeth of the zealous craving of the elites of virtually every sector of our society against the project to dispossess america by another massive disingenuously promoted immigration amnesty _meta_end_dot_

 we have triumphed many times _meta_end_dot_

 but the other side is regrouping and shall hurl themselves against our ramparts again soon enough _meta_end_dot_

 with all that in mind i invite you to sign up for the redstate action email list _meta_end_dot_

 there is no cause for despair but there is cause for alarm _meta_end_dot_

 my language may be extravagant and antiquated even comical but the future of the republic is no laughing matter _meta_end_dot_

 if by this small effort of organization we can do our part to secure that future from socialism from degeneracy from jihad and sharia and a dozen other menaces we shall have done well _meta_end_dot_

 we shall have avoided the taunt that the left is preparing for us a taunt which though it misuses the material would heap scorn upon us with the famous lines of bob dylan
