  so i just finished bemoaning this weird cult like enthusiasm for a presidential wannabe in his pretty empty suits standing alongside his ghandi equivalent among women and now i have to be subjected to this via newsbusters umm please tell me he didn t say that please _meta_end_exclamation_

 apparently olbermann another unbiased and neutral journalist was in on this little love tryst as well _meta_end_dot_

 of course we ll never know where obama tingles him but it s pretty clear they are both smitten with the presidential hopeful from illinois _meta_end_dot_

 the whole thing makes me tingle too in the pit of my overturned stomach thank you very much _meta_end_dot_

 have a little context with that regurgitation _meta_end_question_

 then go below the fold for the objective assessment from matthews and the banter between him olbermann and brian williams if your stomach is empty of course _meta_end_dot_

 read on _meta_end_dot_

 don t tread on it _meta_end_question_

 i want to stick a hot poker in my ear after having heard it _meta_end_dot_

 i don t know about the rest of you but i think it s a fair question to ask whether journalist licenses might start getting pulled when these clowns start using our airwaves to campaign for candidates instead of just telling us what people say and do and allow we the consumer to decide what tingles once we find out what s going on in the world _meta_end_dot_

 sheesh and this on coffee number _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_
