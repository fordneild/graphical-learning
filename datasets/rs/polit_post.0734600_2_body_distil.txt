  it s a banner day for the online left isn t it _meta_end_question_

 not only do we have got good old cindy sheehan off in san francisco attacking nancy pelosi s ankles we ve got cynthia mckinney off questing for the green party nomination _meta_end_dot_

 via say anything via protein wisdom _meta_end_dot_

 read on _meta_end_dot_

 let me be the first of many many people from both parties to express the fond hope that ms _meta_end_dot_

 mckinney will achieve her goal and become the green party nominee for president _meta_end_dot_

 i look forward to seeing her quaint views on _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ foreign policy racism and the jews be given as wide an airing as possible preferably while she is either standing underneath a banner for the green party or in the company of other members of the antiwar movement _meta_end_dot_

 in fact when we have the debates between the real candidates we could even let her have a question or two _meta_end_dot_

 oh yes this will be fun _meta_end_dot_

 but do you know what the really funny part is _meta_end_question_

 the really funny part is that establishment democrats are probably just as happy that she s jumped ship _meta_end_dot_

 you think that they wouldn t be but i suppose that they ve decided that their pet progressives won t go anywhere else anyway thus letting them tack the democratic party to the center in perfect hypocritical serenity _meta_end_dot_

 to be fair it s not like they don t have empirical evidence supporting that decision _meta_end_dot_
