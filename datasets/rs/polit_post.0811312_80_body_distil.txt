  today the supreme court hears oral argument in davis v _meta_end_dot_

 federal election commission challenging the so called millionaire s amendment of the mccain feingold campaign finance law _meta_end_dot_

 this case has enormous implications for future campaign finance regulation a victory for the government defending the law will open the floodgates to more regulation in an effort to equalize political speech _meta_end_dot_

 and as most conservatives can readily guess equalizing usually means silencing conservatives _meta_end_dot_

 more below the fold _meta_end_dot_

 since buckley v _meta_end_dot_

 valeo in _meta_number_ref_ the supreme court has allowed congress and the states to regulate political speech in the form of campaign contributions and spending on issue ads in order to fight corruption or its appearance _meta_end_dot_

 since austin v _meta_end_dot_

 michigan chamber of commerce in _meta_number_ref_ the court has accepted a very broad definition of corruption that includes the corrosive and distorting effects of immense aggregations of wealth that are accumulated with the help of the corporate form this has given us the current complex regime that not only limits contributions but prohibits many ads that even mention a candidate within _meta_number_ref_ days of an election _meta_end_dot_

 nonetheless even now the need to justify regulation by demonstrating corruption or its appearance is at least some check on government regulation of political speech _meta_end_dot_

 davis has the potential to change that _meta_end_dot_

 under the millionaire s amendment when a wealthy candidate self funds his campaign his opponent is allowed to receive treble the usual campaign contribution maximum plus he can engage in unlimited coordinated spending with his political party which the self funded opponent cannot do under the law _meta_end_dot_

 the self funded candidate is also penalized with added reporting requirements _meta_end_dot_

 all of this has nothing to do with preventing corruption _meta_end_dot_

 moreover it undercuts the stated anti corruption rationale in the current law if it is not corrupting for a candidate to receive a _meta_dollor_ref_ contribution when he really needs the money because he is facing a well funded self funded opponent it is difficult to justify the usual limit of _meta_dollor_ref_ as necessary to prevent corruption _meta_end_dot_

 rather the millionaires amendment is justified on straightforward equality grounds _meta_end_dot_

 it is also clear that congress wanted the law because incumbents are much less likely to self fund their campaigns than challengers _meta_end_dot_

 and congressmen and senators fear few things more than a well funded self funded challenger _meta_end_dot_

 if the court upholds the law it will allow congress and the states to engage in a lot more regulation for the purpose of equalizing campaigns _meta_end_dot_

 and you know what that means npr subsidized talk radio subject to fairness doctrine corporate political spending limited left wing pew charitable trust spending unlimited and restrictions on challengers that don t much harm incumbents and so on all in the name of promoting equality which can mean whatever congress wants _meta_end_dot_

 on the other hand if the court strikes down the law it will undercut efforts to impose government funded campaigns on us with complete bans on private spending because most of those plans place limits on candidates to try to equalize the results _meta_end_dot_

 and it will call into question the entire an generally bogus anti corruption rationale that the court has previously tolerated for the case demonstrates that limits on political contributions and spending have less to do with preventing corruption than with protecting incumbents and limiting disfavored usually conservative speakers _meta_end_dot_

 expect a decision in june _meta_end_dot_
