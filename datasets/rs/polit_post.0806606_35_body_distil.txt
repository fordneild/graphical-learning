  if the republican party is to repair and reclaim its tarnished brand as the party of individual rights and responsibility of limited government and of real solutions for the american people one issue on which the gop must lead is health care _meta_end_dot_

 the mantra of _meta_number_ref_ million and growing uninsured americans has become part of every democrat politician s standard rhetoric _meta_end_dot_

 the left and many members of the media are treating so called universal health coverage as though it is a the correct solution to the u s s health care woes b a foregone conclusion and c simply a matter of timing an detail at this point _meta_end_dot_

 further several polls show that a significant portion of the american population views the current health care situation both as an important issue and as one which should be further intervened in and regulated by government _meta_end_dot_

 this trend toward support of the democrat platform on health care means that republicans must eschew sitting idly by in favor of coming up with coherent workable response to the left on health care lest through their inaction they allow the party of government intervention to permanently own the issue _meta_end_dot_

 read on _meta_end_dot_

 the strength of public opinion on the side of greater government involvement in heath care which is helped along by media outlets like cnn who find lifelong republicans who claim they are now going to vote democrat because they are the party that promises to offer universal coverage and who demand that all positions except those in favor of state health care be vigorously defended dictates that the gop move slightly leftward from a position on health care that demands strictly free market based solutions _meta_end_dot_

 however republicans can still occupy a niche far to the right and far more pro choice than that in which the democrats are currently ensconced _meta_end_dot_

 as with many issues health care and health coverage two entirely separate concepts which have been blurred together in the public and political consciousness are emotional topics therefore they are more easily capitalized on by the sloganeering appeal to heart not mind left than by the right who given the fact that their positions and prescriptions are based on economic and practical reality is often stuck doing a great deal of explaining of their ideas complete with the numbers and formulae that show why they will actually work _meta_end_dot_

 that being said if the gop is willing to make the effort to get in front of the press and the american people for not in but for the next three years and explain their health care policy and why it will work better than the state run programs proposed by the democrats then they have a very real chance to make progress in educating the american people and in taking back an issue that should by all practical rights be one on which the republican party is more trusted by the citizenry _meta_end_dot_

 to do this the gop needs to come up with a market based health care platform one which is unified and workable and which acknowledges heath care and health coverage as a necessity while maximizing consumer choice and provider competition _meta_end_dot_

 the gop should vocally embrace choice expanding and cost saving options and solutions like articulate the problems with other state run health care systems as the second half of this public relations offensive the gop absolutely must make sure that the problems with state run health care systems around the world are presented to the american people _meta_end_dot_

 for example in britain alone examples of the folly of state run health care abound from canada where saskatchewan residents for example drive across the border into north dakota by the hundreds every year and pay cash for magnetic resonance imaging mri scans without waiting the canadian standard _meta_number_ref_ to _meta_number_ref_ months to russia _meta_end_dot_

 by law every russian citizen is entitled to free health care what this has wrought despite president vladimir putin s doubling state health care spending during his term is a system that is astronomically expensive rampant with corruption and dependent on massive bribes to get any manner of quality care whatsoever _meta_end_dot_

 examples of the mess that government health care can lead to can be found much closer to home as well _meta_end_dot_

 for example for a glimpse at what democrats would lead us into with state run health care americans need look no further than a notorious example here at home the infamous building _meta_number_ref_ at walter reed _meta_end_dot_

 health care is an issue that the republican party can lead on but it will take a concerted and collaborative but uncompromising effort along with better public relations savvy than the gop has been known for of late _meta_end_dot_

 solutions are available to the current health care crisis that are much more market based than what has been offered to date by democrats and the republican party needs to begin touting those as frequently and as loudly as possible _meta_end_dot_

 an individual mandate a governmental requirement that every citizen have health insurance is neither enforceable nor advisable _meta_end_dot_

 however the fact is we require that every driver in the country be insured and while millions of people will get through their lives without ever having needed their automobile insurance _meta_percent_ref_ of people will at some time in their lives need medical treatment or care _meta_end_dot_

 this means that health coverage must be accessible to those who can afford and desire it as a great number of the _meta_number_ref_ million uninsured are that way because of personal choice and available in some form to those who cannot afford to insure themselves _meta_end_dot_

 advocating market based reforms like hsas interstate competition and tax credits will help make that coverage more accessible _meta_end_dot_

 advocating increased choice may help persuade the american people that the republican party s platform on this issue is the one which is capable of benefiting them the most _meta_end_dot_
