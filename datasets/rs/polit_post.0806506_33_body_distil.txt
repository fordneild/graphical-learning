  so you re asking yourself right now how bad can it be really _meta_end_question_

 yes she won rhode island _meta_end_dot_

 yes she won ohio by a lot _meta_end_dot_

 yes at this stage of the game she s on track to win at least the primary in texas but there s still the caucus which he ll probably win and there s all those lawsuits pending and there are more races and hasn t everyone been telling us that she ll never be the nominee anyway _meta_end_question_

 so it s not that bad right _meta_end_question_

 we wanted something like this right _meta_end_question_

 yes it s that bad _meta_end_dot_

 no you really didn t want this _meta_end_dot_

 yes the next six weeks are going to be exquisitely depressing for you _meta_end_dot_

 read on _meta_end_dot_

 or don t _meta_end_dot_

 you pretty much stopped being relevant to this race when hillary clinton won ohio _meta_end_dot_

 i would lecture you on vote totals and the need to balance winning states like idaho against losing states like ohio and so on and so on ad infinitum and ad nauseam _meta_end_dot_

 but there s no need for that senator hillary clinton has made it very simple _meta_end_dot_

 she has looked over the situation she has decided that she can still win and so she will keep in the race _meta_end_dot_

 and she will not be making a token effort _meta_end_dot_

 that means that senator barack obama must do the same thing _meta_end_dot_

 that means that this race goes on full throttle through at least april _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 all that money that the two have collected _meta_end_question_

 guess what _meta_end_exclamation_

 it s going to get spent _meta_end_dot_

 advertising is expensive not to mention various and sundry _meta_end_dot_

 well let s not call them bribes _meta_end_dot_

 merely considerations but that s ok they ll just call you up for more money _meta_end_dot_

 and more money _meta_end_dot_

 and then some more money on top of that _meta_end_dot_

 because it s important _meta_end_dot_

 and if you can t cough it up well there s always corporate america _meta_end_dot_

 lobbyists are actually made of money you know _meta_end_dot_

 it s true _meta_end_exclamation_

 look it up on wikipedia _meta_end_dot_

 that s why they don t mind giving it away to politicians _meta_end_dot_

 especially ones desperately looking for an edge _meta_end_dot_

 by the way did i mention how tiring campaigning is _meta_end_question_

 living out of suitcases spending each night in a different hotel driving back and forth across the country _meta_end_dot_

 it s no life for a person or people or group of people who have every tic outburst burst of temper and or gaffe being recorded for posterity or at least the nightly news _meta_end_dot_

 and they will make mistakes _meta_end_dot_

 and nobody was really expecting this to last this long so they ll be making more mistakes as time goes on _meta_end_dot_

 hopefully amusing ones but i m sure that the increasingly bored media that will be following both campaigns around are up to the task of ensuring that _meta_end_dot_

 meanwhile of course our candidate has wrapped up his nomination and will be spending the next few months preparing for the general election _meta_end_dot_

 i m sure that you re looking forward to seeing one or the other of your candidates go after him disabuse yourself of that notion _meta_end_dot_

 if one of them does the other will take advantage of his her lowered guard to strike a dirty blow of his her own remember every dime spent attacking senator mccain is a dime not spent ensuring the nomination which is the important thing right now _meta_end_dot_

 if both of them do mccain will simply murmur something about waiting until there s an actual democratic candidate to give his answer _meta_end_dot_

 mind you there s nothing really stopping him from going after either candidate on his own _meta_end_dot_

 and i need hardly point out that thanks to the absolutely byzantine laws governing delegate allocation the nomination will almost be decided at the democratic national convention by the eventual consensus of the super delegates _meta_end_dot_

 which is another way of saying that the democratic party has wasted a good deal of your time attention and money but will be expecting you to replenish their stocks of all three anyway _meta_end_dot_

 and i think that pretty much sums it up doesn t it _meta_end_question_

 you re going to hate the next few weeks the campaign s going to end up being the political equivalent of an abscessed tooth for you the gop is meanwhile going to take this gift from the gods to do some needed infrastructure work and it s all going to be essentially meaningless from your perspective anyway _meta_end_dot_

 and oh yes you ll be needing to send the democratic party more money _meta_end_dot_

 pause i don t know how you should handle it honestly _meta_end_dot_

 heavy drinking maybe _meta_end_question_

 moe lane which she actually in fact can _meta_end_dot_

 yes yes i know somebody online told you that she couldn t _meta_end_dot_

 that person probably also told you that obama was going to win big tonight that she d drop out tomorrow and that the dnc knows better than you do about how to spend your money _meta_end_dot_

 so at least contemplate the possibility that you might have gotten some bad information ok _meta_end_question_
