 if the chinese are seen as a reliable trading partner and the united states is not then china will likely beat the u s _meta_end_dot_

 to being able to access markets around the world _meta_end_dot_

 i certainly don t begrudge the chinese as they try to do well in the field of international trade _meta_end_dot_

 but i certainly begrudge american leaders who apparently are bound and determined to have us unilaterally disarm and retreat behind protectionist walls reconciling ourselves to less and less prosperity in the process _meta_end_dot_
