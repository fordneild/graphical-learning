  i never thought i d say this but _meta_end_dot_

 go hillary go _meta_end_exclamation_

 open thread _meta_end_dot_

 update by erick let me throw this into the open thread discussion _meta_end_dot_

 a friend of mine who is a very reputable pollster tells me that in california the major media polling firms did not do any spanish language polling _meta_end_dot_

 he also said that in texas despite the lessons they should have learned in california the media is again not doing serious spanish language polling _meta_end_dot_

 with the latino vote around _meta_percent_ref_ of the primary hillary could have a bigger polling advantage that we ve seen which is probably why obama is setting the bar higher than win to win with double digit lead update by ericka andersen amazing there is actually footage of john mccain in vietnam but it s helpful in times like these when gloria steinem is questioning his service and liberals are downgrading the significance of his pow status as well _meta_end_dot_

 but the following john mccain video will touch politicos of any party or ideology so watch and be moved
