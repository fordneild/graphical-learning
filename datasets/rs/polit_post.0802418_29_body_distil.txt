  former democratic speaker of the house sam rayburn famously said son republicans aren t the enemy _meta_end_dot_

 the senate is the enemy for conservatives interested in small government and familiar with congress there might be a different formulation son democrats aren t the enemy _meta_end_dot_

 appropriators are the enemy along similar lines americans for prosperity phil kerpen says it is often said and largely true that washington has three political parties the democrats the republicans and the appropriators today bob novak calls the appropriators and leadership the business as usual gop given that this is a change election it strikes me as fair to ask who the appropriators support _meta_end_dot_

 the answer is clear mitt romney _meta_end_dot_

 read on _meta_end_dot_

 of his _meta_number_ref_ congressional endorsements the list is not complete _meta_end_dot_

 it misses rep _meta_end_dot_

 john carter r tx an appropriator _meta_number_ref_ of them are appropriators including yesterday sen _meta_end_dot_

 thad cochran r ms the senate republican appropriator in chief _meta_end_dot_

 someone recently off the list is former speaker dennis hastert also no inspiring hero of conservatives interested in small government _meta_end_dot_

 john mccain has _meta_number_ref_ out of _meta_number_ref_ congressional endorsements _meta_end_dot_

 that number would go to _meta_number_ref_ if jeff flake a small government hero is appointed to appropriations _meta_end_dot_

 but as novak points out don t count on it _meta_end_dot_

 and rudy giuliani has _meta_number_ref_ out of _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 here s my question _meta_end_dot_

 if mitt romney is the change candidate who will fix washington what did he tell the business as usual crowd to make them so happy with him _meta_end_question_
