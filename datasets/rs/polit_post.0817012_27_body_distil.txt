  my fellow contributors at redstate have had no shortage of posts the past few days on the need to drill for oil _meta_end_dot_

 the message is finally resonating on capitol hill where house minority whip roy blunt is producing a daily gas chart and senate republican leaders are beginning to talk tough _meta_end_dot_

 these are positive developments but rhetoric alone will not solve our energy problems _meta_end_dot_

 that requires leadership and action two things that are hard to come by in congress _meta_end_dot_

 fortunately for the gop oil drilling appears to be something everyone can agree on _meta_end_dot_

 republicans who don t always see eye to eye sens _meta_end_dot_

 ted stevens alaska and tom coburn okla come to mind are in sync when it comes to this _meta_end_dot_

 the party s nominee sen _meta_end_dot_

 john mccain gave his colleagues a big boost this week with an endorsement for offshore drilling _meta_end_dot_

 while mccain s energy position is far from perfect anwr remains off limits for him republicans can t let that slow them down _meta_end_dot_

 they should take this fight to the democrats at every opportunity _meta_end_dot_

 and they can begin by shutting down the senate if democrats refuse to allow offshore drilling _meta_end_dot_

 i m talking about an old fashioned filibuster _meta_end_dot_

 i know it won t be like mr _meta_end_dot_

 smith goes to washington but why not make a spectacle of it _meta_end_question_

 the next time majority leader harry reid tries to do something call his bluff _meta_end_dot_

 there s a reason newt gingrich has collected nearly _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ names for his petition calling for more drilling _meta_end_dot_

 americans are tired of inaction _meta_end_dot_

 forcing a showdown on capitol hill is the best move senate republicans could make _meta_end_dot_

 not only would it bolster the party in the short term but it would also give gop leaders some backbone for future fights _meta_end_dot_
