  it appears that barack obama allegedly decent guy and agent of change in washington requested an earmark in _meta_number_ref_ for _meta_dollor_ref_ million taxpayer dollars for the hospital where his wife works _meta_end_dot_

 said hospital by the way gave michelle obama a huge raise nearly _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ more than doubling her salary in _meta_number_ref_ after barack got elected to the united states senate _meta_end_dot_

 now i know that there are lots of ways to talk about transactions like this involving public officials quid pro quo etc but i prefer to call a crook a crook and just say that we re dealing with good old fashioned public corruption here _meta_end_dot_

 i am having an especially hard time distinguishing obama s actions here from those of say duke cunningham who is currently in prison _meta_end_dot_

 i suppose you might say that obama injected some more efficiency into the process by eliminating the middle man but while i m a big fan of efficient markets generally speaking i happen to think that there should not be any sort of market at all for the votes of public officials _meta_end_dot_

 perhaps these silly notions of ethical propriety are what obama intends to change if he is elected president _meta_end_dot_

 if that s the case i ll take the status quo thanks _meta_end_dot_

 without the quid _meta_end_dot_
