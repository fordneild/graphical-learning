  promoted from diaries i think that it s well past time that we stopped letting those malicious gaia raping ecophobic hippies stand in the way of carbon neutral energy sources don t you _meta_end_question_

 particularly since we all know that they re just doing it because there s darned good money in promoting antinuke hysteria among the luddite left _meta_end_dot_

 further update please note that the previous should not be considered to include ordinary decent greens particularly the ones willing to trade coal plant mega wattage for nuclear mega wattage on an one to one basis moe lane from the the new york post a picture is still worth a thousand words _meta_end_dot_

 this one is worth at least then thousand _meta_end_dot_

 we have so many people arguing we should punish oil to get to tomorrow _meta_end_dot_

 almost no one says stop punishing nuclear _meta_end_dot_

 if we had of been reasonable about nuclear power back in the day we wouldn t be talking about alternative energy now _meta_end_dot_

 btw i really do love the greens crossposted at _meta_url_ref_
