  super effing tuesday is upon us in all its fearsome glory _meta_end_dot_

 were i in a state that was voting i d have rented out a dive bar for conservatives to join in a raucous celebration of this momentous triumph of suck _meta_end_dot_

 we ve had all the predictions and there are tons of open threads to occupy you here tonight _meta_end_dot_

 but there are three points that i think will likely emerge as the night goes on _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 mccain will not lock this up tonight _meta_end_dot_

 he ll have to go on to win virginia and likely all the way to texas but if the exit polls hold he has to hope that huckabee who s played his wingman for about the past three weeks continues to play nice and is content to coast to being the last action hero s veep _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 romney continues to perform horribly in the south despite having a ton of endorsements and a very good campaign organization _meta_end_dot_

 the south is still the most personality driven political arena in america and there are some things that not even money and machines can overcome _meta_end_dot_

 i don t think he s going to get enough momentum out of the west to change that in the coming primaries _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 i respect dr _meta_end_dot_

 dobson more than a lot of other folks but the idea of releasing a statement that he ll stay home and won t vote in a mccain clinton election this late in the game indicates to me that he isn t all that enthused about throwing support to huckabee or romney _meta_end_dot_

 had dobson announced this a week ago he would ve had a definite impact today and moved a few key points to whoever he wished _meta_end_dot_

 but by waiting and making this a non factor i think it s a sign that as much as he dislikes mccain dobson is resigned to the fact that he s the likeliest nominee _meta_end_dot_

 my prescription for getting through the night i recommend strong bourbon and a large dose of michael barone and karl rove _meta_end_dot_

 update romney s speech tonight seemed more resigned than optimistic _meta_end_dot_

 this one hurts and i just don t think his heart s in it any more _meta_end_dot_

 as for huckabee his staff is just giddy with the potential for wins in ar ga al wv mo and tn this is a much better night than anyone expected and unless romney performs above expectations in california huckabee s path to victory while still very unlikely is now much more realistic than romney s _meta_end_dot_

 ks va tx ms nc ky all of these are states where huckabee can have a far more realistic foothold than romney _meta_end_dot_
