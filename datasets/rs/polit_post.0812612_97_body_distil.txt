  and so we greet a lovely monday morning in the spring of pain _meta_end_dot_

 permit me to quote from bob heinlein s a writer who i am morally certain that michelle obama would never read voluntarily quite good and habitually misunderstood starship troopers read on _meta_end_dot_

 it s one of the funny little accidents of history really _meta_end_dot_

 you see some time in about oh _meta_number_ref_ or so it suddenly dawned on the american voting public that whoever they elected president of the united states of america would have the shiny new ability to destroy entire countries in an afternoon _meta_end_dot_

 that later got upgraded to being able to wreck civilization above the township level and very possibly exterminate the entire human race _meta_end_dot_

 this naturally can alarm a people even americans who are widely considered to be insanely optimistic pollyannas with no in the bone appreciation of how bad things can get _meta_end_dot_

 so we quietly changed things around a little _meta_end_dot_

 now this is of course all my own opinion _meta_end_dot_

 still it really does help to think of the american electoral system as one big test to destruction we take a group of self confessed egomaniacs and run them through the wringer every four years _meta_end_dot_

 not enough sleep not enough exercise constant exposure to disease and discomfort a blizzard of information to be instantly memorized and discarded and the constant threat that every mistake made and mistakes will be made will be splashed across the front page of every paper on the planet _meta_end_dot_

 and just to top it all off at some point somebody will come up to you and smash you in the face with a lead pipe just to see how you react to that _meta_end_dot_

 so what s happening to senator obama is not a failure of the system _meta_end_dot_

 it is the system _meta_end_dot_

 it is in fact overdue _meta_end_dot_

 the reason why his wife is upset besides the fact that it s her husband and the father of her kids being whacked around is that from her point of view it came pretty much out of nowhere which is _meta_end_dot_

 reasonable if both irrelevant and meaningless _meta_end_dot_

 the american voting public needs to know if he can take a punch it s a shame that it s apparently never happened before but that s a matter for the illinois democratic party itself to address frankly _meta_end_dot_

 so barack when james carville surrogate of a candidate that has already gone through this process says things like if she gave him one of her cojones they d both have two here s a free hint smile _meta_end_dot_

 shrug _meta_end_dot_

 maybe roll your eyes _meta_end_dot_

 don t acknowledge the hit _meta_end_dot_

 and don t use your wife to say the things that you can t _meta_end_dot_

 that s what anonymous staffers are for _meta_end_dot_

 moe lane ps by the way michelle tom maguire would like to bring up some bare knuckle electoral habits exhibited by your husband during his state senate campaign _meta_end_dot_

 you know that guy knew how to brawl so what happened _meta_end_question_
