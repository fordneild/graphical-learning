 douglas kmiec suggests that hillary clinton if elected could have her husband follow the footsteps of former president taft by appointing him to the supreme court _meta_end_dot_

 taft was in fact a very good chief justice after being a failure as president a job for which he never had the talent or desire _meta_end_dot_

 prof _meta_end_dot_

 kmiec gets right some of the obvious problems with this parallel clinton unlike taft has no prior judicial experience and loves politics much more than the law clinton unlike taft would presumably not be taking the chief justice job and taft unlike clinton never had his law license suspended for perjury in a judicial proceeding _meta_end_dot_

 what prof _meta_end_dot_

 kmiec misses is the showstopper even beyond losing him as a campaigner that would prevent hillary clinton especially from considering this confirmation hearings _meta_end_dot_

 read on _meta_end_dot_

 nobody in her right mind who was at all sympathetic to bill clinton would ever want to see the man testify under oath again _meta_end_dot_

 and given the tendency of modern confirmation hearings to delve into any and all scandals in the nominee s past hearings with bill clinton as the nominee would be both exhaustively lengthy and acrimonious and potentially uniquely damaging to hillary personally _meta_end_dot_

 assuming the democrats hold control of the senate they could potentially try to quash much questioning at the hearings but even republicans who hold principled objections to filibustering judges would be on firm ground blocking a floor vote until the judiciary committee was willing to hold a full hearing on the nominee _meta_end_dot_

 i suppose in theory i could imagine hillary pulling such a stunt as a deliberate provocation and or for the express purpose of breaking the tradition of such hearings _meta_end_dot_

 but i think it far more likely that she would avoid at any cost the spectacle of william jefferson clinton being sworn in to testify anywhere ever again _meta_end_dot_

 i confess that i don t know whether there would also be legal problems with appointing a spouse to a federal judgeship but since prof _meta_end_dot_

 kmiec refers to anti nepotism laws precluding a bill clinton role in hillary s cabinet i assume or at least hope he considered this angle _meta_end_dot_

 updated a commenter at my blog points out that kmiec and i both missed the obvious fact that the president s husband would have to recuse himself from an enormous number of cases frequently to the detriment of hillary s agenda _meta_end_dot_

 another strike against justice bill _meta_end_dot_
