  pennsylvania s _meta_number_ref_th district sat safe in republican hands since the _meta_number_ref_s that is until after the _meta_number_ref_ election when rep _meta_end_dot_

 don sherwood was deservedly bounced from the seat after his involvement in a bizarre episode of adultery abuse and cover up came to light _meta_end_dot_

 the sherwood saga began in _meta_number_ref_ when one cynthia ore locked herself inside the bathroom of his washington d c apartment and called _meta_number_ref_ to report an assault _meta_end_dot_

 when police arrived she accused the married congressman of choking her he countered that he had merely been giving the young woman a massage _meta_end_dot_

 no charges were filed as both parties have left out significant information or are not willing to discuss in detail what actually happened according to the police report _meta_end_dot_

 the report went unnoticed until _meta_number_ref_ when veronica hannevig who had run against mr _meta_end_dot_

 sherwood on the constitution party ticket in _meta_number_ref_ distributed a copy to several newspapers and television stations _meta_end_dot_

 mr _meta_end_dot_

 ore was merely a casual acquaintance _meta_end_dot_

 ms _meta_end_dot_

 ore later filed a _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ million lawsuit against mr _meta_end_dot_

 sherwood won only _meta_number_ref_ percent of the vote against a challenger who spent less than _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ on her campaign _meta_end_dot_

 exacerbating his shameful support of pro abortion liberal arlen specter then sen _meta_end_dot_

 rick santorum had also endorsed mr _meta_end_dot_

 in november the associated press reported a story that mr _meta_end_dot_

 sherwood had agreed to pay ms _meta_end_dot_

 ore about _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ in hush money in other words she would forfeit some of the pay off if she talked publicly about the case _meta_end_dot_

 ore would not receive the full amount until after the election giving her a powerful incentive for her to keep quiet until after election day _meta_end_dot_

 a few days after the ap story mr _meta_end_dot_

 sherwood lost to democrat chris carney who was supported by democrats like barack obama and jack murtha _meta_end_dot_

 don sherwood doesn t deserve to represent the _meta_number_ref_th district _meta_end_dot_

 but neither does chris carney another power grabber on a quest to tighten the greedy grasp of government _meta_end_dot_

 meuser who shuns real reform for democrat lite mollycoddling _meta_end_dot_

 while mr _meta_end_dot_

 hackett favors allowing citizens to control their own private social security accounts mr _meta_end_dot_

 meuser opposes personal accounts _meta_end_dot_

 while mr _meta_end_dot_

 hackett calls for fundamental reform of our nation s byzantine tax system mr _meta_end_dot_

 meuser advocates more of the piecemeal tax cuts that have helped make it the incomprehensible monument to absurdity that it is _meta_end_dot_

 and while rino apologist rick santorum supports mr _meta_end_dot_

 meuser the club for growth has endorsed mr _meta_end_dot_

 hackett _meta_end_dot_
