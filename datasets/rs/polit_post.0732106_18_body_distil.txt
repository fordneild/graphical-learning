  so i suppose that this was expected _meta_end_dot_

 or should have been to be sure hillary clinton was not going to let her campaign s slow bleed continue any longer than she had to _meta_end_dot_

 she showed that she learned from the mistakes that she made in her previous debate and last night she let her opponents make the mistakes _meta_end_dot_

 to the extent that they sought to take her on she bashed back _meta_end_dot_

 the conventional wisdom will duly reward her _meta_end_dot_

 but that doesn t mean her vulnerabilities still don t exist especially with the raft of negative stories that came out over the past couple of weeks about her _meta_end_dot_

 and that doesn t mean her opponents can t continue to take advantage of those vulnerabilities _meta_end_dot_

 hillary clinton is a tough and resourceful candidate and no one should underestimate her _meta_end_dot_

 but we all have learned that she is not ten feet tall _meta_end_dot_
