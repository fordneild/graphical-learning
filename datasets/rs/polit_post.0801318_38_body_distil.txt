  despite some reporters of all people making the mike murphy link mr _meta_end_dot_

 murphy kindly emailed me this evening about this post _meta_end_dot_

 he writes noted here credible rumors are circulating having started with reporters who were approached about the story that mike murphy who blogs at the weekly standard as richelieu pushed out the thompson to endorse mccain rumor in iowa _meta_end_dot_

 this all tracks with a report by jed babbin on the politico hit job notes this all kind of fleshes together with murphy who has worked for both mccain and romney but whose blogging has been decidedly pro mccain at the standard _meta_end_dot_

 amazing that no media organizations have really gone after this _meta_end_dot_

 this story actually wound up hurting i think romney in addition to thompson _meta_end_dot_

 romney has a connection to murphy _meta_end_dot_

 the morning of the report i and others immediately made the mccain connection but by the afternoon reporters and people close to thompson were pushing the romney angle all suspecting murphy _meta_end_dot_

 but given murphy s blogging lately it seems he is in this for mccain _meta_end_dot_
