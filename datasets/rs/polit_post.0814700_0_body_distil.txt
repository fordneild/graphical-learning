 on nbc s meet the press russert had another of his panel discussions this one with six people speaking at once _meta_end_dot_

 most of the time was taken by jon meacham of some weekly glossy magazine _meta_end_dot_

 the best expression came from cbn s david brody who said that hillary was hoping for barry to have a bill buckner moment on cbs s face the nation hillary s head mouthpiece howard wolfson would not rule out a scenario in which hillary would force multiple votes at the democratic national convention in denver _meta_end_dot_

 he did say though that he thought she would win before then _meta_end_dot_

 next on ftn lindsey graham noted that barack obama had not been to iraq to speak to general petraeus and prime minister maliki since _meta_number_ref_ since which time much had changed for the better _meta_end_dot_

 dick durbin said that more important than all of this was jim webb s little political gimmick bill _meta_end_dot_

 read below the fold for what happened on this morning s talk shows _meta_end_dot_

 terence mcauliffe on fns _meta_end_dot_

 on fox news sunday host christ wallace s first guest was hillary campaign boss terence mcauliffe who spent the first _meta_number_ref_ minutes of the show being grilled about hillary s comment that rfk was assassinated in june of _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 what she was talking about was the timeline she never apologized for speaking of assassinations in reference to her opponent but mcauliffe argued that this had nothing to do with barry or his campaign _meta_end_dot_

 she was not going to apologize to him nor should she she expressed regrets which mcauliffe equated with an apology and wallace asked to whom _meta_end_dot_

 to the kennedy family mcauliffe answered and rfk had bitten the hook _meta_end_dot_

 this was an issue mcauliffe argued because it was a slow news weekend _meta_end_dot_

 hillary had said that she had the kennedys on her mind because of teddy s illness but wallace pulled up a quote from the march _meta_number_ref_ issue of time infotainment magazine in which hillary had made the point that robert kennedy was assassinated in june of _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 so hillary was lying right _meta_end_question_

 mcauliffe argued that hillary has given a lot of interviews which is a lot like her excuse for telling her rapt audiences that she and chelsea dodged sniper fire in tuzla _meta_end_dot_

 on to other matters mcauliffe would of course like to see all the dem delegates seated including those from florida and michigan _meta_end_dot_

 this rules out plans offered to the dem convention rules committee by those two states separately which would seat delegations with partial votes _meta_end_dot_

 the rules committee will decide what to do on friday mcauliffe at which time the clinton campaign will decide what to do next such as fight this all the way to the convention if need be _meta_end_dot_

 the thrust of the hillary campaign mcauliffe said is that hillary would fare better than obama in the electoral college having won all the swing states _meta_end_dot_

 he said he speaks to bill clinton all the time and reports that bill was pushing hillary for veep are all false van hollen and cole on fns _meta_end_dot_

 next up for wallace on fns were the two congressional campaign committee bosses the dccc s chris van hollen and the rncc s tom cole _meta_end_dot_

 cole was quick to point out that the dems now run the least popular congress in history the democrats want to spend more money while the republicans want to spend less he argued _meta_end_dot_

 wallace asked him about the bloated farm bill for which cole had voted and cole argued that this farm bill cost less than a previous one and that he had decided that it just was the best time to get a deal done _meta_end_dot_

 asked about the dem congress van hollen argued that the dems had not diminished the president s ability to fight terrorism rather he argued they had refused amnesty for phone companies which collaborated with the bush administration _meta_end_dot_

 the word collaborated was probably carefully chosen by the dem van hollen as it evokes thoughts of the old nazi collaborators cole argued that the dem congress has done nothing on energy issues mentioning that they refuse to address the supply of oil _meta_end_dot_

 wallace asked cole if he would agree to a total ban on earmarks and cole said that this is what the republicans had proposed met with dem silence _meta_end_dot_

 wallace suggested that the republicans could refuse earmarks on their own and cole argued that it takes both parties to make things happen in congress _meta_end_dot_

 republicans cannot do it alone he said van hollen argued that earmarks had quadrupled during the republican congress and it was the dems who brought transparency to the process _meta_end_dot_

 he also argued that the democrats want to stop _meta_number_ref_s from participating in our elections _meta_end_dot_

 axelrod on tw _meta_end_dot_

 obama advisor david axelrod was host george stephanopoulos first guest on abc s this week this morning _meta_end_dot_

 msnbc sportscaster keith olbermann has evidently been whining about hillary s mention of rfk s assassination and axelrod distanced himself from both the words and the sportscaster _meta_end_dot_

 he dismissed olbermann by saying that he s entitled to his own opinion _meta_end_dot_

 on hillary s claim to the lead in the popular vote count in the dem presidential race axelrod responded it would take some tortured math and tortured logic to say she s ahead in the popular vote he then argued that florida and michigan don t count and that the popular vote is meaningless this isn t american idol _meta_end_dot_

 was he comparing mcauliffe to sanjaya when steph presented the argument that his old boss hillary would win the swing states axelrod responded that obama could beat mccain in colorado virginia and north carolina _meta_end_dot_

 you know the new electoral map thing _meta_end_dot_

 steph presented dianne feinstein s argument that the dem party is split into two constituencies which could be united by the dream ticket _meta_end_dot_

 axelrod responded by relating that the campaign is getting plenty of unsolicited advice _meta_end_dot_

 rove on tw _meta_end_dot_

 next up on tw was fox news political analyst karl rove _meta_end_dot_

 rove argued that since obama has done nothing in his three years in the senate he must try to do something which shows his leadership in his campaign such as say he will pick republicans to sit on his cabinet _meta_end_dot_

 rove argued that obama need not break with president bush rather he must create a clear image of himself among the american people he must run his campaign with authenticity not triangulation _meta_end_dot_

 steph sneered that the republican brand was garbage at this point and he asked rove what went wrong in the path to a permanent republican majority rove countered that the country was still center right the party he argued must get back to talking about this not about other things _meta_end_dot_

 steph asked rove about the trouncing the republicans took in _meta_number_ref_ and rove responded that it was a fairly typical off year election _meta_end_dot_

 he backed this up with the stats and concluded that the gop had suffered a very narrow defeat the war he argued was not the deciding issue _meta_end_dot_

 wolfson on ftn _meta_end_dot_

 on cbs face the nation host bob schieffer s first guest was hillary s chief mouthpiece howard wolfson _meta_end_dot_

 first up the rfk assassination which schieffer characterized as one of the reasons she hillary is going to stay in the race wolfson argued that hillary meant that elections have lasted a long time in the past _meta_end_dot_

 he called it an historical reference he complained that her remarks have been blown out of proportion he asserted that hillary apologized and schieffer argued that she did not _meta_end_dot_

 schieffer played hillary s excusing her self in the new york daily news saying that she was blaming others _meta_end_dot_

 wolfson accused the news media of being wrong and misleading wolfson agreed with mcauliffe that hillary needn t apologize to obama _meta_end_dot_

 he said hillary was concentrating on the twin goals of winning and unifying _meta_end_dot_

 wolfson accused the obama campaign of inflaming the situation _meta_end_dot_

 wolfson said that axelrod had changed the tone from the obama campaign s initial attacks on hillary _meta_end_dot_

 schieffer pushed that mcauliffe s remarks this morning that hillary need not apologize to obama were wrong _meta_end_dot_

 he chuckled when wolfson stood pat on agreeing with terence for the umpteenth time _meta_end_dot_

 schieffer asked wolfson is hillary would take this to the convention to be settled on the second or third ballots _meta_end_dot_

 wolfson said that he expects hillary to be the nominee before that not ruling out taking this through several votes at the convention _meta_end_dot_

 wolfson said that rather than harming the democratic party what hillary is doing is brining more people to the polls for the democrats _meta_end_dot_

 lindsey graham and dick durbin on ftn _meta_end_dot_

 schieffer next spoke to mccain supporter lindsey graham and famed nazi hunter dick durbin an obama supporter _meta_end_dot_

 schieffer opened by asking about mccain s little party in arizona _meta_end_dot_

 graham said that mccain was like a kid at christmas showing off his new ranch out here with some fifty species of birds _meta_end_dot_

 he said that the event was purely social durbin wants to put the hillary rfk bit behind them _meta_end_dot_

 graham said that mccain will make the case that we had the wrong strategy in iraq for four years mccain was calling for more troops when others wanted to get out _meta_end_dot_

 he said that president bush accepted mccain s argument _meta_end_dot_

 mccain gets credit for the surge _meta_end_dot_

 he challenged obama to go back to iraq and talk to general petraeus and prime minister maliki as much has changed since barry s last visit in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 schieffer asked if mccain and obama could go together and graham though that would do the country good to go together and have the same briefing _meta_end_dot_

 after a quick commercial break durbin said that he would not set obama s schedule but that mccain ought to meet with our returning veterans who ought to get the same treatment as those who returned from world war ii meaning that supporting jim webb s partisan political gimmick is more important than knowing what is really happening in iraq _meta_end_dot_

 durbin argued that obama had met petraeus and asked him questions really he did in committee not one on one he accused the mccain campaign of being behind a negative ad put out by an outside org _meta_end_dot_

 graham repeated that obama had not been to iraq since _meta_number_ref_ how can you make an informed judgment on iraq if you haven t been there in two years a panel on mtp _meta_end_dot_

 on nbc host tim russert deigned to fill his time on a holiday weekend with one of his panels this time with six media types yapping politics at the same time cbn s david brody maureen dowd of the new york times historian doris kearns goodwin the washington post s ruth marcus jon meacham of one of the infotainment glossies and gwen ifill of pbs _meta_end_dot_

 ifill was on instead of the promised sixth wheel michelle mee shell norris of pbs russert joked that the rest of america was barbecuing while this group was talkin politics which shows that he expected his show this week to be watched by no one but me _meta_end_dot_

 russert led with a clip of hillary and the rfk assassination bit _meta_end_dot_

 goodwin said that neither of hillary s historical allusions were true as bill had locked up his nomination before june and bobby kennedy had gotten into the race only six weeks prior to his assassination _meta_end_dot_

 goodwin further suggested that obama might have another gaffe or be assassinated between june and the convention in august _meta_end_dot_

 modowd said that hillary s timing was bad as it followed the anniversary of mlk s assassination came just prior to the anniversary of rfk s assassination and came right after we learned of teddy kennedy s cancer _meta_end_dot_

 she accused bill clinton of orchestrating a hostile takeover of obama s veep selection process and hillary of giving delegates the creeps meacham sat there and smirked _meta_end_dot_

 ifill recommended that people never speak of hitler or assassinations in politics _meta_end_dot_

 she spoke also of poking sores _meta_end_dot_

 meacham said that though obama didn t have the number of delegates needed to secure his party s nomination this was a technicality and the delegates were irrelevant he asked mocking the clintons what is the meaning of june several on the panel laughed _meta_end_dot_

 meacham said that hillary s campaign knows that obama is moving toward the nomination while hillary herself was delusional about it _meta_end_dot_

 he said that hillary was waiting for something bad to happen to obama and that this was lousy for a dem party which by every measure should be burying john mccain another assassination reference he compared hillary in _meta_number_ref_ to reagan in _meta_number_ref_ and kennedy in _meta_number_ref_ running a strong challenge in the primaries but failing in the end also representing part of the reason their parties lost in the general _meta_end_dot_

 david brody said that obama was very close to victory and that hillary was hoping to see from obama as bill buckner moment _meta_number_ref_ the ball goes between the legs he pointed out that there were two oppo research teams going after barry at the same time now _meta_end_dot_

 ruth marcus said that hillary s rfk remark hurt her chances to be obama s veep _meta_end_dot_

 and so this went for half an hour too numbing too transcribe with the dunderheaded meacham doing about _meta_number_ref_ _meta_percent_ref_ of the talking with his rambling meaningless answers _meta_end_dot_

 harman and dreier on le _meta_end_dot_

 leading off cnn s late edition host wolf blitzer spoke to congress critters jane harman and david dreier _meta_end_dot_

 he started them off with hillary s rfk assassination remarks and i got to see the clip for the umpteenth time plus one _meta_end_dot_

 harman said that hillary had regretted those remarks wolf and so do i she said that the race has to be over soon and that the loser will concede gracefully _meta_end_dot_

 wolf played for dreier the audio clip of obama saying that people make careless statements when campaigning as a republican and a strong supporter of john mccain what do you think dreier thinks that if rfkjr is okay with it so is he _meta_end_dot_

 he said that barry s class warfare rhetoric is a non starter while mccain is pro growth and wants to reduce the size of government _meta_end_dot_

 harman a hillary delegate says that she plans to support the dem ticket because of iraq katrina and specific to mccain three words the supreme court wolf argued that the government has exploded as has the national debt under a republican president what kind of track record is that dreier said that mccain is committed _meta_end_dot_

 blitzer asked for harman s reaction to the delegate county _meta_end_dot_

 is it too late for her to find the math to salvage her race harman admits that she doesn t know the math but she suggested compromises on michigan and florida seated both and the super delegates will then commit _meta_end_dot_

 the loser she said has to fight for unity _meta_end_dot_

 harman wants to end the combat mission in iraq and move the troops to more dangerous parts of the middle east wolf asked dreier about talking to our adversaries the way ronald reagan talked to the former soviet union dreier said that the talks between israel and syria were failing because syria refused to distance itself from iran _meta_end_dot_

 we can t reward this kind of behavior harman argued that _meta_number_ref_ californians have lost their lives in iraq and afghanistan _meta_end_dot_

 she then saluted the iraqis for doing much better and argued that this means that we should leave and let them take care of everything _meta_end_dot_

 she further argued that we have made iran stronger by not negotiating with them _meta_end_dot_

 wolf was big on getting ready to break to obama s speech subbing for the ailing ted kennedy to the commencement at wesleyan u _meta_end_dot_

 this is a direct snub to hillary who is a graduate of wellesley college which sounds a lot like wesleyan have at it _meta_end_exclamation_
