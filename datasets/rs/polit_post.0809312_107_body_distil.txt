  it s hard to believe that planned parenthood could sink any lower than they already have with their blatant encouragement and provision of abortions but they have _meta_end_dot_

 last year lila rose the editor of ucla s student newspaper the advocate posed as a _meta_number_ref_ year old girl seeking an abortion at a local planned parenthood _meta_end_dot_

 rose was told specifically to lie about her age in order to receive the abortion without parental consent _meta_end_dot_

 planned parenthoods across the nation secretly employ this tactic everyday and have been accused of routinely failing to report sexual abuse of children and performing illegal abortions without the proper paperwork _meta_end_dot_

 see the case of phill kline here for a perfect example of this abuse this time lila rose and the advocate exposed another atrocity at planned parenthood _meta_end_dot_

 they called organizations throughout the nation posing as donors seeking specifically to exterminate black babies _meta_end_dot_

 speaking with different pp representatives each time the person was told their money could be specifically donated to fund the abortion of a black baby _meta_end_dot_

 even when the caller used outrageously racist language such as there are too many black people or mentioned not wanting their children to be hurt by affirmative action the representatives agreed to take the money for the purpose of aborting a black child _meta_end_dot_

 this new video demonstrates a disturbing trend of racism at planned parenthood said lila rose editor of the advocate said in a recent press release _meta_end_dot_

 planned parenthood has no shame in accepting donations intended to purposely abort minority populations _meta_end_dot_

 people have forgotten the organization was founded on these principles and has continued to operate under these same racist views for decades read on another video included below the fold listening to these calls was excruciating as none of the reps expressed disgust or refused to accept the money for such gross purposes _meta_end_dot_

 but it all goes back to the founding of planned parenthood by racist and anti semite margaret sanger who believed in eugenics and socialism _meta_end_dot_

 i found a quote in which she said we are failing to segregate morons who are increasing and multiplying _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 a dead weight of human waste _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 an ever increasing spawning class of human beings who never should have been born at all this one is hard to stomach as well but it s important the public see what kind of organization planned parenthood really is
