  not only is the corporate tax in the united states larger than it should be to serve as a catalyst for employment and economic growth but now there is an effort afoot to try to prevent corporations from having the ability to defer foreign source income tax payments _meta_end_dot_

 and of course if this effort is successful we will have people like barack obama hillary clinton and their advisers all wondering what happened to the jobs that they thought would remain in this country but instead went overseas in response to the onerous corporate tax requirements that exist here in the united states _meta_end_dot_

 it really boggles the mind _meta_end_dot_

 in cheerier news dan mitchell the author of the cato post linked above has prepared yet another video explaining the laffer curve mitchell and company really deserve a lot of credit for their efforts _meta_end_dot_

 the laffer curve has been traditionally misinterpreted and misapplied sometimes intentionally by people who would rather make a debating point than be right about tax policy and the theory underlying the policy _meta_end_dot_

 misinterpreting and misapplying the laffer curve will be a lot harder thanks to dan mitchell s efforts _meta_end_dot_

 here s hoping that tinkering with the corporate tax and getting disastrous results will be a lot harder too thanks to his post _meta_end_dot_
