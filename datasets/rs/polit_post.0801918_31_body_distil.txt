  contrary to popular belief amongst the democrats the surge continues to enjoy progress and show signs of ultimately working according to plan _meta_end_dot_

 there are many indicators of our finally approaching success as president bush started calling it when after so much hatred and vilification from the anti war crowd and their democrat puppets in congress we were all forced to retool our expectations away from a once hoped for victory _meta_end_dot_

 it s ok you say to may to i say to mot to whatever floats your boat _meta_end_dot_

 so we find in this little gem a rather significant piece of news that very little fuss is being made about whatever you do don t tell those idiots running the house and senate _meta_end_dot_

 why they might stop focusing on roger clemens steroid scandal and find some nifty new way to muck things up over there before our soldiers can finish this thing and pull back into the support role we ve been promised all along and is getting closer every day to becoming a reality _meta_end_dot_

 god bless our brave men and women for they show us how to get things done in spite of the roadblocks democrats put in front of them _meta_end_dot_

 more below the fold _meta_end_dot_

 i am rather amused at how oddly coincidental it is that good news from iraq is all but non existent in our so called mainstream media right now _meta_end_dot_

 in fact i bet there s an algorithm some math whiz could muster to draw a corollary between the amount of iraq coverage versus these silly presidential primaries and which one gets more weight under the contrived notion that one is only more important than the other depending on which one best aligns with the media s agenda but i digress _meta_end_dot_

 it went right by all of us that the anti war kooks have been forced to retreat from their lofty aspirations of usurping the powers of the executive branch relegating themselves to the nonsensically naive notion that they can now define long term troop placement strategies with a blossoming new ally in the middle east in the long war against terrorism what kills me in this last is the idea that the democrats are no longer trying to hide the fact that their only concern regarding iraq and the war on terrorism is just how they can wrangle and mangle truth reality and our long term needs for securing this country against those who would see us dead by the millions if they could solely because of their aspirations to ascend to power and retain it for generations _meta_end_dot_

 no one is asking what exactly they ll do when they have this power they lust so strongly after should another couple airplanes fly into buildings and kill innocents _meta_end_dot_

 of course many of us believe they ll just raise our taxes and send some blood money to the terrorists because they seem to believe poverty is what drives them along with a healthy dose of repression _meta_end_dot_

 why of course they ll stop wanting to kill us if they could live as well as we do how could we not know that _meta_end_question_

 despite every effort on the part of democrats progress continues _meta_end_dot_

 and while i m sure it makes them all want to spit over there at the un even they have been forced to face a reality they ve spent years trying to undermine huh changed our mind welcome to the dark side of hope persistence and a willful refusal to accept anything but victory un peeps _meta_end_dot_

 we like to call that america round these parts _meta_end_dot_

 now if only we can keep this a secret from the democrats _meta_end_dot_

 it s possible i suppose it s not like they actually read any of the reports from the ground in iraq why should they _meta_end_question_

 they might have to adopt a position that actually risks their ascendancy to power over the defeatists in america _meta_end_dot_

 that sadly would be bad for business _meta_end_dot_
