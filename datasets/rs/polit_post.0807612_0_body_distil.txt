  every now and then governments in every country including ours find themselves having to reach for the ultimate social policy tool armed repression of their own people _meta_end_dot_

 that s happening in tibet this week _meta_end_dot_

 to be precise the chinese are not repressing their own because the bloodshed in lhasa is directed against a people whose land was taken by force early in the mao years and whose ancient and beautiful culture is being systematically exterminated _meta_end_dot_

 but it s an odd case because somehow there is someone from the west there to see it and it s a bit mysterious how and why the chinese allowed that to happen _meta_end_dot_

 update the dalai lama weighs in alleging _meta_number_ref_ deaths in lhasa already and demanding an international investigation _meta_end_dot_

 more _meta_end_dot_

 i noticed in the print version of this week s economist that they had gotten permission for one of their reporters to visit lhasa _meta_end_dot_

 one wonders exactly how much free rein this gentleman has and whether the chinese authorities let him in on purpose _meta_end_dot_

 or were they blindsided by the sudden eruption of violence and figured they d lose more face by forcibly ejecting the reporter than by leaving him where he is _meta_end_question_

 anyway here s the top of his latest dispatch the rest of the post is full of revealing details but continues in this rather circumspect vein suggesting that perhaps in deference to his nervous hosts the really interesting stuff is being left unsaid _meta_end_dot_

 especially in regard to the killings by chinese security forces which he tiptoes very carefully around _meta_end_dot_

 we ve been consumed with our domestic economic and political stories so far this year _meta_end_dot_

 but some very interesting things are going on in china _meta_end_dot_

 for one thing inflation primarily of food prices is raging nearly out of control _meta_end_dot_

 i m not saying food prices are the root of the problem in tibet which is exploding because of brutal repression _meta_end_dot_

 but what if things also get nasty in beijing this spring _meta_end_question_

 you don t need to remind me that china is a little different in that they don t have the respect for individual human life that we do _meta_end_dot_

 or that mao once suggested he d be perfectly happy to sacrifice half of china s population in the process of winning a war even so killing people always takes its toll on the legitimacy of a regime _meta_end_dot_

 just ask janet reno oh heck i ll say the word _meta_end_dot_

 tiananmen _meta_end_dot_

 and just in time for the olympics too _meta_end_dot_
