  you may think that s an odd title for a blog post about comedian and senate candidate al franken but those are his words _meta_end_dot_

 in his book lies and the lying liars who tell them franken attempts to paint anyone who disagrees with him as a liar or worse _meta_end_dot_

 ironically enough this book has put the failed radio host on a path of lies and deceit due to his failure to pay for workers compensation while the book was being written and researched _meta_end_dot_

 franken s defense ignorance _meta_end_dot_

 while this may apply to franken in most cases it is a hard sell in this instance _meta_end_dot_

 in order to believe franken s claims of ignorance on his corporate governance problems you must believe totally disregarding reality franken claims he never knew about his new york problems because he moved to minnesota in april of _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 to believe this you must also believe these additional franken claims _meta_number_ref_ franken never received or knew about any of the dozen notices sent to him by the state of new york regarding his failure to pay worker s compensation insurance _meta_number_ref_ franken never received any notices or heard from the collection agency hired by the state of new york to collect the workers compensation insurance premiums franken failed to pay to believe franken s claims of ignorance you must ignore the following facts read on _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 franken listed his new york city apartment as the mailing address for rep _meta_end_dot_

 tammy baldwin s campaign to send a refund check to in november of _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 franken still owns his new york city apartment _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 franken voted twice in new york city elections in september and november of _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 franken s new york address was listed on campaign donations to the dscc in october of _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 franken lists his new york city address in the _meta_number_ref_ harvard alumni review _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 franken neither paid nor according to him should have paid taxes to minnesota in _meta_number_ref_ the year he claims to have moved to the state additionally it has been revealed that jason gauthier who franken and his campaign have refused to divulge is most probably the doorman and signer of a certified letter sent to franken s home alerting him to his failure to pay worker s compensation insurance _meta_end_dot_

 franken could have at any time since march of _meta_number_ref_ confirmed who it was that had signed for and delivered his mail _meta_end_dot_

 of course once caught in his lie franken has been insistent in sticking by his lie _meta_end_dot_

 it will be interesting if franken intends to blame the doorman for his problems and if he has already communicated to the doorman to stay quiet _meta_end_dot_

 warning to the doorman franken has already thrown his cpa under the bus by blaming him for failing to pay taxes in _meta_number_ref_ states over the past five years _meta_end_dot_

 that cpa s reputation is being destroyed by a client who will take no responsibility for his own actions _meta_end_dot_

 and now after all the silence lies and leaps of faith franken is asking of the public and press he has the audacity to raise money for what he calls the truth fund unfortunately this fund will not go towards uncovering the truth about franken s many misdeeds but instead with be used in an attempt to distract from the problems that have sent his campaign into a nose dive _meta_end_dot_

 al franken is quickly learning the meaning of the old saying what a tangled web we weave when others we try to deceive his campaign s foundation of lies and deceit is crumbling below him and soon franken will be able to add failed senate candidate to his lackluster resume _meta_end_dot_

 and that s the truth _meta_end_dot_
