  yesterday hardworking taxpayers across america once again scrambled to comply with our nation s burdensome and confusing tax code _meta_end_dot_

 it seems as though each year complying with the federal tax code becomes more time consuming and tricky _meta_end_dot_

 according to the tax foundation as of _meta_number_ref_ irs regulations contained over _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ words that s almost nine times the total number of words in the king james bible _meta_end_dot_

 additionally the irs currently lists _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ separate forms schedules and instructions on its website _meta_end_dot_

 in fiscal year _meta_number_ref_ the irs estimated that individual and business taxpayers spent _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ billion hours complying with tax laws _meta_end_dot_

 that is the equivalent of _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ million employees working _meta_number_ref_ hour weeks year round without any vacation _meta_end_dot_

 clearly american taxpayers are spending too much time and money complying with the current tax code and i am working hard to make the process of paying taxes easier and more fair on everyone _meta_end_dot_

 ultimately the american people deserve a completely new tax code one that is not tweaked and twisted into a complex maze of rules provisions and loopholes _meta_end_dot_

 it should be a priority of every member of congress to lower federal taxes and make the tax code fairer and simpler _meta_end_dot_

 i have laid out my priorities in the american taxpayer bill of rights and am supportive of other measures to accomplish this goal _meta_end_dot_

 last year i introduced as a member of the republican study committee the american taxpayer bill of rights this established four basic rights to ensure that taxpayers across america receive a more efficient and accountable government _meta_end_dot_

 these include _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 taxpayers have a right to have a federal government that does not grow beyond their ability to pay for it _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 taxpayers have a right to expect the government to balance the budget without having their taxes raised _meta_end_dot_

 currently in congress multiple bills have been introduced that would help to stabilize and grow the american economy through tax cuts _meta_end_dot_

 instead of passing legislation to help american taxpayers keep more of their hard earned money to reinvest in their own futures democrats passed the largest tax increase in history causing capital and jobs to flee america _meta_end_dot_

 democrats have eliminated the ability of hardworking taxpayers in florida to deduct their state sales tax from their federal income taxes _meta_end_dot_

 residents of states with a consumption tax instead of an income tax like florida and texas are being punished as this is the last year this deduction is an option _meta_end_dot_

 democrats are unfairly penalizing these taxpayers and i have cosponsored hr _meta_number_ref_ to help restore equality among taxpayers _meta_end_dot_

 hr _meta_number_ref_ would amend the internal revenue code to make the deduction of state and local general sales taxes permanent a crucial piece of legislation that must be addressed immediately _meta_end_dot_

 to ensure that our nation remains prosperous and our economy vibrant i encourage all members of congress to support the tax increase prevention act of _meta_number_ref_ which would make permanent the republican tax cuts of _meta_number_ref_ and _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 should these tax cuts expire as they are currently set to do every federal tax bracket will have a rate increase more taxpayers will fall victim to the amt and businesses will not be able to claim a tax credit for research experimentation and development activities _meta_end_dot_

 to keep america s economy growing we must make the tax cuts of _meta_number_ref_ and _meta_number_ref_ permanent _meta_end_dot_

 full repeal of the alternative minimum tax amt is a vital component of establishing a healthy u s _meta_end_dot_

 economy _meta_end_dot_

 i am a cosponsor of hr _meta_number_ref_ the taxpayer choice act of _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 this would repeal the increasingly burdensome and unfair amt and offer taxpayers a choice of participating in the current tax system or in a new highly simplified one _meta_end_dot_

 i strongly support the fair tax act which would eliminate the federal income tax and the irs and instead allow american families to keep more of their hard earned money _meta_end_dot_

 hr _meta_number_ref_ the fair tax act would eliminate the federal income tax and the irs replacing them with a national sales tax to be administered primarily by the states _meta_end_dot_

 this in and of itself would greatly simplify the system for determining individual s federal taxes _meta_end_dot_

 this week in congress we are voting to send _meta_dollor_ref_ billion overseas for foreign debt cancellation _meta_end_dot_

 congress should spend hard earned taxpayer dollars on vital national interests and keep americans employed rather than shipping billions overseas _meta_end_dot_

 actions like this are taking place time and time again with this liberal majority and its no wonder that americans are frustrated with what they see coming out of washington _meta_end_dot_

 american taxpayers have lost faith in the way congress is spending their hard earned dollars _meta_end_dot_

 as elected officials we have an obligation to be good stewards of the people s money _meta_end_dot_

 we have a responsibility to create a simplified tax code that removes barriers to economic growth and prosperity while generating resources to help protect america from its national security threats _meta_end_dot_

 it is my hope that this dream for hardworking taxpayers can be come a reality _meta_end_dot_
