  if you want a preview of what strategy john mccain will apply against barack obama as a nominee look no further than the remarks he delivered last night in alexandria _meta_end_dot_

 you can watch video of it here _meta_end_dot_

 it s an interesting line of attack and blunter than i expected it to be the subtext is that mccain has seen hope win through in the trenches not the halls of harvard law _meta_end_dot_

 and its effect is one of reaching out to moderate democrats and conservative republicans who care about getting things done effectiveness in leadership while cornering obama as a naif whose thinly disguised hype filled message of a new new deal reaches out only to liberal democrats _meta_end_dot_

 we ll see what comes of it _meta_end_dot_
