  i know that this topic has been covered but i just have to pile on _meta_end_dot_

 this would be giggle inducing if the consequences were not so calamitous for the venezuelan people read on _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 and so between this post and the one immediately preceding it we see that robert mugabe and hugo chavez appear to be in a race with one another for the title of world leader least familiar with basic economic principles it s a shame someone has to win _meta_end_dot_

 for that matter it s a shame the game is even being played _meta_end_dot_
