  mark kleiman who never served in the military is throwing stones at the service record of john mccain who served heroically _meta_end_dot_

 hey if people like kleiman could for so many years rely on the odious chickenhawk argument to slime those who don t agree with them politically i can point out basic facts _meta_end_dot_

 john mccain doesn t need lectures on how to serve the country in wartime _meta_end_dot_

 he certainly never needed them from mark kleiman who cannot possibly fathom what mccain has been through _meta_end_dot_
