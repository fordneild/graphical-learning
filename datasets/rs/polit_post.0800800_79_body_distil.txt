 tomorrow voters will go to the polls in new hampshire to do their part in selecting the republican and democratic presidential nominees the outcome of the primary is of course unknown and polling over the last few days makes it hard to predict but one thing is certain whichever democrat is ultimately nominated he or she will bring to the table far less experience and expertise in defending and advancing america s interests abroad than what will in fact be required _meta_end_dot_

 over the next few years our country will face unprecedented challenges in the foreign policy arena we are all aware of course of the continued threat posed by al qaeda and associated terrorist groups we are also aware of the need to bring stability and security to iraq and indeed the middle east as an entire region but there are other challenges too one is how to engage positively and bolster our relations with pakistan another is how to work with a resurgent russia and there are good reasons to question iran s intentions with regard to the development of a nuclear weapon put bluntly none of the potential democratic nominees is up to the task of dealing with such matters and voters should be wary of the notion that they are equipped to lead where such complex issues are concerned _meta_end_dot_

 obama the winner of the iowa caucuses has of course voted against funding our troops in iraq last summer he also indicated that were he elected to the presidency and were the us to obtain actionable intelligence about high value terrorist targets within pakistan he would act unilaterally if president musharraf did not it was an amateurish enough error to earn obama schooling from sen _meta_end_dot_

 biden the way to deal with it is not to announce it and was dismissed as downright irresponsible by pakistan s foreign minister yet obama reiterated his commitment to unilateral action under these circumstances in saturday s debate so not only did he exhibit a serious deficiency in judgment the first time round it seems he still has not learned his lesson _meta_end_dot_

 clinton she who has also voted against funding the troops also recently demonstrated a shocking unawareness of pakistani matters referring to president musharraf reelected several months ago as a candidate and on the ballot in relation to upcoming parliamentary elections on sunday as captured by cnn she tried to bolster her credibility on foreign affairs matters by claiming to have played a key role in relation to the northern ireland peace process a dubious assertion to be sure _meta_end_dot_

 edwards exhibits virtually no interest in international affairs preferring instead to focus on talking about raising taxes nixing free trade interventionist big government approaches towards health care and the like sure he ll talk about iraq but only in terms of apologizing for his original vote to authorize military action there and pledging to withdraw us troops as fast as he possibly can irrespective of the good work they are doing as was well pointed out by fred barnes this weekend _meta_end_dot_

 which is of course the main focus of the whole democratic field and capable though they may all be of redeploying us forces out of iraq post haste at the end of the day it s clear the democratic frontrunners are not leaders capable of adeptly confronting the multitude of foreign policy challenges we face for that reason no matter how good a game they may talk they must be rejected _meta_end_dot_
