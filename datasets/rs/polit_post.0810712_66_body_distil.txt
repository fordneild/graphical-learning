  the latest hillary clinton ad pretty much summarizes the democratic race in a nutshell _meta_end_dot_

 on the one hand the ad throws a great punch at one of barack obama s more egregiously disingenuous attempts to pass himself off as mr _meta_end_dot_

 new politics pointing out that his advertised claim not to take money from oil companies is bogus on two levels nobody takes money from the companies themselves since it s illegal but obama has received plenty of donations from oil company executives and employees just when you are ready to gag cheer on hillary though we get a rapid descent into utter nonsense as she claims that she ll make oil companies pay to create the new jobs _meta_end_dot_

 america needs so how exactly is hillary supposed to make oil companies create new jobs in the united states _meta_end_question_

 read on _meta_end_dot_

 well consider what oil companies actually do using as an example exxonmobil the company that so personifies big oil that it might as well just change its name to standard oil exxonmobil has approximately _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ corporate employees according to its _meta_number_ref_ annual report plus another _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ employed at company operated retail sites i e gas stations _meta_end_dot_

 according to the company s _meta_number_ref_ corporate citizenship report approximately _meta_percent_ref_ of the corporate employees are located in the u s and while a quick google search didn t reveal a more reliable source for a further breakdown wikipedia claims that the company employs _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ employees in its fairfax downstream headquarters and _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ people in its houston upstream headquarters the annual report defines these two lines of business upstream and downstream as follows so i ask you this precisely where are more u s _meta_end_dot_

 jobs at exxonmobil going to come from _meta_end_question_

 as noted the company s two main business lines already have their headquarters here so it s not going to be management jobs _meta_end_dot_

 let s start with the upstream business exploration production transportation and sale of crude oil and natural gas _meta_end_dot_

 is hillary planning to expand exploration and production in the u s _meta_end_question_

 that can be done the teamsters would love to see more good drilling and refining jobs created here at home from drilling in anwr and off the florida coast to building the new refineries we haven t had in three decades _meta_end_dot_

 but hillary in the past has opposed such things the very ad in question boasts that she has opposed even tepid energy bills proposed by the bush administration is she now going to change course and start drilling like john d _meta_end_dot_

 rockefeller over the shattered corpses of filthy obama supporting hippie environmentalists _meta_end_question_

 that would be newsworthy i ll say that much but it s not in evidence in the ad _meta_end_dot_

 electric power generation _meta_end_question_

 more nuclear plants maybe _meta_end_question_

 you aren t going to create a ton of jobs building wind farms that s for sure _meta_end_dot_

 but if hillary has proposed building new nuclear plants i ve missed it _meta_end_dot_

 what about the downstream business _meta_end_question_

 m anufacture transportation and sale of petroleum products _meta_end_question_

 to do that you need to increase demand is she really running on a platform of increasing demand for oil _meta_end_question_

 as it happens exxonmobil reports growth in employment at company operated retail sites from _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ in _meta_number_ref_ to _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ in _meta_number_ref_ almost _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ new jobs a _meta_percent_ref_ increase though it s unclear how many of those are in the u s _meta_end_dot_

 but that growth is only going to continue if the company keeps opening new gas stations _meta_end_dot_

 how exactly does she propose to compel the company to do that _meta_end_question_

 so what is she proposing _meta_end_question_

 here s what her website says is the basis for the ad s claims supposedly this new strategic energy fund _meta_end_dot_

 will create _meta_number_ref_ million new jobs and bring down energy costs if you actually try to plow through the bill itself you will quickly recognize it for what it is a marriage of central planning a big fund of government controlled money to be handed out as the government sees fit to old fashioned washington special interest tax breaks tax incentives tax expenditures and other goodies to be earmarked and dispensed to _meta_end_dot_

 well to get us back to where we started presumably to companies whose executives and employees donate to the right people in washington _meta_end_dot_

 like so many things in democratic orthodoxy the promise of good new domestic jobs is basically at odds with the very things higher taxes more environmental regulations hillary proposes to do and she proposes to square that circle by having the government take over the business _meta_end_dot_

 she s very good at one critical public service explaining how barack obama is full of it _meta_end_dot_

 but when it comes to her own agenda hillary too is selling snake oil instead of the real thing _meta_end_dot_
