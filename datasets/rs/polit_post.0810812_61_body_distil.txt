  i missed last night s dem debate but host george stephanopoulos asked candidate barack obama about his tawdry relationship with domestic terrorist bill ayers of the weather underground who conspired to destroy federal buildings in the _meta_number_ref_s then decades later expressed regret that he did not succeed _meta_end_dot_

 according to the account given by scott whitlock at newsbusters org obama responded by comparing ayers to senator tom coburn r oklahoma read more below the fold _meta_end_dot_

 whitlock also tells us that msnbc sportscaster keith olbermann whined after the debate if you cannot argue with the message you report that you think the messenger hannity has cooties _meta_end_dot_

 that s not very murrow esque keefums but did you see the yankees red sox game last night _meta_end_question_

 t was another high scoring affair you know _meta_end_dot_

 not just steph hillary blasted barry well in its main article on the dem debate the los angeles times mentions only obama s relationship with fellow chicagoan william ayers the _meta_number_ref_s radical who is now an education professor at the university of illinois the paper mentioned nothing about bombing the pentagon or ayers published regret that the plot failed _meta_end_dot_

 the washington post did a bit better barry it would be one thing if the weather underground had been a discussion group and ayers disavowed those discussions and that philosophy but we re talking about conspiracy to destroy federal buildings for which ayers is entirely unapologetic _meta_end_dot_

 that speaks directly to your inability to discern a difference between an intellectual proposition and a is a reality and your willingness to embrace evil _meta_end_dot_

 it is a dangerous trait in the president of the united states and it is why though he will be the democratic party s nominee this year he will not be elected president _meta_end_dot_
