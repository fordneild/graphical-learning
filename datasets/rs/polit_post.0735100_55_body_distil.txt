  behold _meta_end_dot_

 after we get over all of the predictable talk about how lieberman is yet another neocon who can t be trusted and never really was a democrat and should be drummed out of the party and would have been drummed out of the party if only ned lamont could live up to the netroots fantasies let us get an answer to the following question how is it that a former vice presidential nominee of the democratic party the man praised nearly eight years ago as being a pathbreaker has ended up departing from the democrats on so crucial an issue _meta_end_question_

 oh sure maybe joe lieberman departed in some ways from the democratic party _meta_end_dot_

 but maybe just maybe the democrats departed in some significant ways from him as well _meta_end_dot_

 and maybe democrats who identify closely with lieberman feel the same way _meta_end_dot_

 they might vote how they feel too _meta_end_dot_
