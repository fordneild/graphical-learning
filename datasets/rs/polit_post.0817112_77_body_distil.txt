  we knew this was coming _meta_end_dot_

 we should not be surprised _meta_end_dot_

 barack obama said he was for public financing of his campaign before he was against it _meta_end_dot_

 this is how he has run his campaign and handled every issue from reverend wright to the security threat that is iran _meta_end_dot_

 barack obama is often one way before he is another way _meta_end_dot_

 the man is incapable of holding to his word _meta_end_dot_

 not since richard nixon has a candidate not used the public financing system for the general election _meta_end_dot_

 i know barack obama has said he wanted to replace the failed policies of the last eight years but even i did not think he would replace them with nixon _meta_end_dot_
