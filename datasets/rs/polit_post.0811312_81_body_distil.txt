  h t glenn both of you know darn well why this situation occurred it occurred because senator obama doesn t know how to talk to the press _meta_end_dot_

 sure he can make a nice speech but his off the cuff stuff has a real tendency to end up being foot in mouth _meta_end_dot_

 shoot after last wednesday s debate debacle i m surprised that the campaign s letting him out in public at all _meta_end_dot_

 i suppose that it d look bad if they didn t or something _meta_end_dot_

 i ll add one more thing jay newton small laid down a very strong hint in his article _meta_end_dot_

 the media doesn t have to write nothing but hagiographies of the obama particularly once senator mccain starts rolling _meta_end_dot_

 obama may give them the audacity of hope but mccain will give them material for deadlines _meta_end_dot_

 guess which one keeps them employed _meta_end_question_

 shorter moe lane finish your waffle later senator _meta_end_dot_

 on second thought never mind anything i just wrote _meta_end_dot_

 you re doing grrreaaattttt _meta_end_dot_
