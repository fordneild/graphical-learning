  from the ground in iraq on his eighth trip there sen _meta_end_dot_

 john mccain s campaign was able to respond to hillary clinton s criticism of him earlier this morning in her speech on america s presence in iraq _meta_end_dot_

 clinton speaking from the comfort and safety of american soil has been to iraq only twice _meta_end_dot_

 her democratic opponent barack obama has visited only once _meta_end_dot_

 amidst a poll released today showing the positive changes iraqis see overall clinton once again denounced the foundational agenda america serves in iraq _meta_end_dot_

 playing off of mccain s badly misused quote she said withdrawal is not defeat _meta_end_dot_

 defeat is keeping troops in iraq for _meta_number_ref_ years ignoring the progress of the surge and scaling back of troops clinton failed to mention the positive polls or applaud the progress our troops have made _meta_end_dot_

 mccain s campaign had this to say also in iraq today is vice president dick cheney _meta_end_dot_

 i m curious what stats would surface if i documented how many times democrat leaders have been to iraq versus republican leaders _meta_end_dot_

 i m guessing the numbers would be vastly different _meta_end_dot_

 maybe that s why republicans are more inclined to highlight the good things that have been accomplished _meta_end_dot_

 clinton is all politics _meta_end_dot_

 mccain is the real thing and he proves it by putting his boots on the ground _meta_end_dot_
