 wallace asked him about the headlines in iowa about fred allegedly telling a crowd that he lacks fire in the belly and does not even want to be president _meta_end_dot_

 smiling thompson responded that this was a case of journalistic malpractice creative reporting _meta_end_dot_

 he said that he had said that he did want to be president and that is why i m doing what i m doing see erick s story from yesterday wallace asked thompson about his standing in the polls in iowa _meta_end_dot_

 the real clear politics average has him a distant third behind huckabee and romney by a _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ margin _meta_end_dot_

 thompson explained that rcp included an outlier in their average one which had him at about _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 thompson is confident that it is much closer than this _meta_end_dot_

 thompson pointed out that the rasmussen national poll had him six points from the lead _meta_end_dot_

 wallace asked thompson if mike huckabee is prepared to be president _meta_end_dot_

 wallace asked thompson if mitt romney is prepared to be president _meta_end_dot_

 romney he said has changed his basic philosophy offering the examples of taxes and immigration _meta_end_dot_

 thompson added that it s hard to pin mitt down on what he actually believes thompson discussed his own national security bona fides _meta_end_dot_

 wallace asked thompson if he should have entered the race earlier as the pundits maintain _meta_end_dot_

 when this process is over he said we can all second guess adding that right now it looks like the timing is really good this was the way they did it in tennessee he explained _meta_end_dot_

 david yepsen on fns _meta_end_dot_

 david yepsen is the political guy at iowa s des moines register and the networks dust him off every four years to talk about these caucuses for a few weeks with chris wallace and fox being no different on this score _meta_end_dot_

 of note wallace pointed out that mitt romney is running the only negative ads in iowa _meta_end_dot_

 he asked if there were any truth to the truism that negative advertising backfires in iowa and yepsen shot that one down negative ads do work he added that huckabee is taking a pounding not just from romney but also from some _meta_number_ref_s _meta_end_dot_

 yepsen said that there were three tickets out of iowa and he thinks john mccain might take the third ticket out _meta_end_dot_

 then he suggested ron paul is the wild card mike huckabee on mtp _meta_end_dot_

 on nbc s meet the press host tim russert began by talking to republican presidential hopeful mike huckabee _meta_end_dot_

 the candidate had dropped nine points in an msnbc mcclatchy poll of iowans _meta_end_dot_

 huckabee offered that the polls were all over the place some have him leading others trailing _meta_end_dot_

 to his credit he did not burst into laughter when russert with a straight face uttered the name mcclatchy let alone msnbc _meta_end_dot_

 russert asked if the commercials regarding huckabee s record might have had some influence _meta_end_dot_

 huckabee said that with the relentless attacks and they were relentless and the fact that he was outspend _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ it s pretty amazing that i am where i am russert asked if mitt romney had said anything about huckabee which was untrue _meta_end_dot_

 huckabee started the list _meta_end_dot_

 mitt claimed that huckabee had reduced meth sentences in arkansas when the truth is that he signed a bill in _meta_number_ref_ which doubled meth sentences which are four times greater than those in romney s massachusetts _meta_end_dot_

 huckabee said that romney accused him of giving special breaks to illegal immigrants _meta_end_dot_

 actually it was a bill concerning the children of such people who had earned scholarships and it never made the legislature _meta_end_dot_

 romney accused huckabee of increasing spending by some ridiculous amount and even the new york times took him apart on this false claim _meta_end_dot_

 huckabee said that romney s claim about tax increases was wrong because the tax increases in arkansas were either court ordered or approved by the voters such as the one to improve roads _meta_end_dot_

 huckabee said that he left arkansas with good roads while romney s were a mess in massachusetts _meta_end_dot_

 romney claims that he did not raise taxes when actually he did raise taxes in the form of fees by a half billion dollars _meta_end_dot_

 he said that he raised taxes for educational purposes and for roads _meta_end_dot_

 i take it then that he opposes abolishing the department of education foreign affairs _meta_end_dot_

 huckabee said that in light of the events of the past few weeks some of his remarks regarding pak seem almost prophetic russert grilled him about his pledge to use military strikes within pakistan to rid it of al qaeda _meta_end_dot_

 russert averred that he would then destabilize the musharraf regime and turn pakistan over to the taliban _meta_end_dot_

 huckabee said the strike would not an effort to destabilize musharraf _meta_end_dot_

 he predicted that the past week s activities would lead to a greater accountability of how our aid checks to pakistan are being spent _meta_end_dot_

 russert asked him if it was worth destabilizing musharraf to capture osama bin laden _meta_end_dot_

 huckabee challenged the assertion that the u s _meta_end_dot_

 strike would destabilize musharraf _meta_end_dot_

 he said that if he were president he would weigh all the information to determine whether it were worth the risk of destabilizing pakistan if we could possibly save american lives and take out al qaeda s number one operative huckabee explained his close the borders to pakistani illegals comment in reaction to bhutto s assassination by saying that he was trying to make the point that what happens in the world affects us here in the u s _meta_end_dot_

 and that he wants to stop pakistanis from crossing our borders with shoulder filed missiles in their briefcases _meta_end_dot_

 when asked for an example of the president s arrogant bunker mentality huckabee said it was secretary of defense donald rumsfeld ignoring the advice of the generals and arbitrarily sending too few troops into iraq _meta_end_dot_

 huckabee pointed out that he s been more consistent in his support of the president when they agree such as with the surge _meta_end_dot_

 he said that mitt romney has been a latecomer in supporting the surge _meta_end_dot_

 huckabee defended his faith nicely against russert s attacks _meta_end_dot_

 it went on for a while _meta_end_dot_

 russert s questions while not softballs were not as tough as some of the questions i ve seen asked here at redstate _meta_end_dot_

 huckabee did not implode by any stretch and handled himself well _meta_end_dot_

 obama on mtp _meta_end_dot_

 russert next grilled democratic presidential hopeful barack obama _meta_end_dot_

 russert showed the olbermann mcclatchy poll and obama said that he s getting great crowds _meta_end_dot_

 obama said it is understandable if the pakistani elections are delayed slightly he said that we should reinstate an impartial judiciary in pakistan _meta_end_dot_

 by we i m sure barry means the united nations and not the united states and russert did not ask barry how many blue helmets he would commit to this reinstatement _meta_end_dot_

 barry said that the government of pakistan must appear legitimate to whom _meta_end_question_

 maybe the u n maybe the u s perhaps france _meta_end_dot_

 russert asked obama if he believes that hillary s vote to invade iraq led to the assassination of benazir bhutto in pakistan last week _meta_end_dot_

 barry answered no _meta_end_dot_

 of course not team barry had evidently said of hillary that by going into iraq we were distracted from afghanistan and fighting al qaeda russert formulated that the war in iraq had distracted us from pakistan which led to the assassination of benazir bhutto _meta_end_dot_

 obama said he s not drawing a causal relationship _meta_end_dot_

 they went over that old stuff about bill clinton telling charlie rose that a vote for obama is rolling the dice because of his inexperience _meta_end_dot_

 obama pointed out the similarities with clinton in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 obama didn t hurt himself i don t think _meta_end_dot_

 ask a dem _meta_end_dot_

 hillary on tw _meta_end_dot_

 on abc s this week host george stephanopoulos first talked to his former boss wife hillary clinton _meta_end_dot_

 hillary took credit for many things which happened during the clinton administration such as the peace deal in northern ireland and keeping the peace with the prc as a spokesman in beijing she said that though she did not sit in on all of her husband s national security meetings and did not have a security clearance she was privy to classified information this is a violation of federal law so she played a major role in the clinton administration she said _meta_end_dot_

 if elected though she promised that her husband bill would not be allowed in on any meetings and would have no formal role _meta_end_dot_

 she promised that she would rely on him only as a wife might rely on her husband _meta_end_dot_

 so he would play no major role in the _meta_number_ref_nd clinton administration she said _meta_end_dot_

 she s not afraid of a loss in new hampshire she said because her husband did not win a primary until georgia s _meta_end_dot_

 john mccain on tw _meta_end_dot_

 steph opened the interview by playing a romney ad attacking john mccain followed by a mccain ad attacking romney both airing in new hampshire _meta_end_dot_

 mccain s ad pointed out that new hampshire s concord monitor had referred to romney as phony and romney angrily accused mccain of a personal attack _meta_end_dot_

 mccain answered steph by pointing out that he was only quoting an important new hampshire paper and by welcoming romney to national politics _meta_end_dot_

 mccain added that despite what team mitt claimed in its attack ad he had never supported amnesty for illegal aliens _meta_end_dot_

 he pointed out that romney was also attacking huckabee a fine person in iowa _meta_end_dot_

 mccain would not himself say if he thought romney were a phony allowing only that the voters will decide mccain did not predict a victory for himself in new hamsphire this morning though he has done so in the past _meta_end_dot_

 john edwards on ftn over on cbs face the nation host bob schieffer interviewed _meta_number_ref_ democratic presidential hopeful john edwards _meta_end_dot_

 schieff asked edwards about bill clinton s assertion that hillary s the only dem with the necessary crisis experience to handle the world today _meta_end_dot_

 edwards disagreed _meta_end_dot_

 when he found out that benazir bhutto had been assassinated he talked to the pakistani ambassador to the united states and demanded to talk to pakistani president pervez musharraf _meta_end_dot_

 musharraf called him several hours later and edwards says he demanded this and that _meta_end_dot_

 he said that musharraf gave in to each demand except for the bit about an international investigation into the murder _meta_end_dot_

 edwards wants the pak elections to be held soon and be legitimate _meta_end_dot_

 schieff asked edwards if it would be possible for bill not to have an official role in a hillary administration _meta_end_dot_

 edwards pointed out that bill on the stump for hillary talks about his views rather than hers _meta_end_dot_

 edwards thinks bill will play a role and suggested that bill could play a role in his own hypothetical administration _meta_end_dot_

 john edwards thinks _meta_number_ref_ s should be illegal even if they air only positive advertising like the ones supporting him and run by his former campaign manager _meta_end_dot_

 he added that he has no control over any of this _meta_end_dot_

 schieffer accidentally called hillary senator hilton you figure it out _meta_end_dot_

 edwards believes that corporate greed and corporate power have a hold on the soul of our democracy _meta_end_dot_

 asked what he d do if he didn t finish at least second in iowa edwards said he s moving and he s moving in a positive way _meta_end_dot_

 fred thompson on le _meta_end_dot_

 on cnn host wolf blitzer first talked to fred thompson _meta_end_dot_

 first topic pak _meta_end_dot_

 blitzer asked thompson if he had confidence in musharraf _meta_end_dot_

 thompson explained that we had to have confidence in him in the short term for stability s sake in a nuclear armed country _meta_end_dot_

 he said that ultimately the people of pakistan are going to have to decide about musharraf adding that things had been moving in the right direction there _meta_end_dot_

 thompson said that our foreign assistant to pakistan should continue for the time being _meta_end_dot_

 this is not time to be parsimonious about it he said _meta_end_dot_

 thompson expressed confidence in pakistan to investigate the death of bhutto adding that he believes al qaeda when they claim credit for the assassination _meta_end_dot_

 he thinks that pak can handle this investigation without any outside nations coming in to tell them how to do it blitzer played the quote i m not particularly interesting in running for president but and asked about it _meta_end_dot_

 fred said that the media but not wolf likes to pick out bits and take it out of context _meta_end_dot_

 fred said that he was not interesting in the process of running but then he listed the reasons why he wanted to be president _meta_end_dot_

 fred said that he has a decent chance of coming in second in iowa _meta_end_dot_

 he s touring _meta_number_ref_ towns and villages getting a chance to spend time with people _meta_end_dot_

 this has created on the ground activity and generated contributions _meta_end_dot_

 thompson is not going to change strategy or message _meta_end_dot_

 there ll be no change in fred he said that he fills pretty optimistic right now hillary on le _meta_end_dot_

 blitzer next spoke to dem hillary clinton _meta_end_dot_

 she demanded that an independent international investigation be launched into benazir bhutto _meta_end_dot_

 she demanded free and fair elections be held immediately adding that she understands that it will take time for bhutto s people s party to select a successor _meta_end_dot_

 not really _meta_end_dot_

 it s her son bilawal bhutto _meta_end_dot_

 it is probable that her husband asif ali zardari is pulling the strings _meta_end_dot_

 it should surprise few if zardari is the eventual candidate despite his criminal record she will put conditions on u s _meta_end_dot_

 funding to pakistan accusing the bush administration of giving a blank check to the musharraf regime she thinks musharraf is not reliable _meta_end_dot_
