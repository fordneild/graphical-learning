  strategy compete in iowa and hopes to get some bump from the brownback endorsement and brownback s iowa organization _meta_end_dot_

 since expectations are very low for mccain and rudy in iowa a third place finish would get a lot of notice _meta_end_dot_

 and unless mccain finishes behind paul he won t attract negative attention _meta_end_dot_

 thus the main pillar of the mccain strategy is nh _meta_end_dot_

 mccain has stated rather optimistically that he will win nh _meta_end_dot_

 and honestly it is a must win state for the senator _meta_end_dot_

 if he wins there then mi will be an interesting three way race among the same three from nh romney rudy mccain _meta_end_dot_

 it s possible that by nv and sc those _meta_number_ref_ could outlast huckabee and thompson _meta_end_dot_

 it s a low probability strategy but it is the only possible way for mccain to survive long enough for his national numbers to matter _meta_end_dot_

 issues i don t recall seeing many candidate discuss nuclear energy but it came up at several townhalls _meta_end_dot_

 the video below is a bit bumpy but it does capture mccain s full response to a question about energy independence and nuclear power _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_nd amendment question and answer video below the fold mccain doesn t say a lot but endorsing the individual right to bear arms is probably the biggest bedrock of pro _meta_number_ref_nd amendment groups _meta_end_dot_

 i also think this video is a good example of the type of questions that are asked at these townhalls and how they are asked often in narrative form rather than short and direct _meta_end_dot_
