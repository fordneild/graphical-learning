  back to the bad old days at least as far as theatrics go _meta_end_dot_

 i suppose that it is nice and reassuring that vladimir putin dmitri medvedev told his audience that war is bad mmmkay and that we ought to be careful not to start any but the message is _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 shall we say _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 undercut by a military parade that might have brought smiles to the faces of brezhnev andropov and chernenko _meta_end_dot_

 to be sure we shouldn t read too much into all of this _meta_end_dot_

 as this article makes clear at the end russia s military possesses more bark than bite _meta_end_dot_

 but there is no question that president putin medvedev wants to remedy this _meta_end_dot_
