  cq politics has a story announcing that ted stevens has a primary challenger _meta_end_dot_

 the link to the story is _meta_url_ref_ the highlights david cuddy is a wealthy real estate developer who ran against stevens in the primary in _meta_number_ref_ and spent _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ in that race and lost obviously if he is challenging this year _meta_end_dot_

 in _meta_number_ref_ republicans were less likely to throw out their own after winning control of the senate just _meta_number_ref_ years prior to that race _meta_end_dot_

 if stevens does survive a primary then one of the candidates the democrats many nominate is ray metcalf who founded the alaska republican moderate party _meta_end_dot_

 so there is a significant chance that liberal and moderate republicans may go to the democrat side if stevens is in the race as they may feel that they would be electing a moderate republican instead of the usual liberal that democrats nominate and also making sure stevens with all of his ethical problems is defeated _meta_end_dot_

 we do not want that so a strong challenger to take out stevens would be a significant help _meta_end_dot_

 now i do not know any of the positions of cuddy _meta_end_dot_

 i know there are some redstate bloggers who are much more familiar with alaska politics _meta_end_dot_

 any information would be very helpful _meta_end_dot_
