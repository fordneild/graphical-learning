  i think given the choice between barack and hillary we should throw our support behind hillary _meta_end_dot_

 to be sure hillary is a threat to our freedom and would be a disaster as president _meta_end_dot_

 but when judging between the evils of two lessers we must sometimes make tough choices _meta_end_dot_

 i write from the premise that regardless of what mccain does this presidential season the odds are still in favor of a democrat in the white house _meta_end_dot_

 and from that vantage point i think obama has the potential to do more long term damage to this nation than hillary clinton _meta_end_dot_

 hillary has an iron fist that will first pound on the democrats and media that opposed her _meta_end_dot_

 it ll be close to three years in the white house before she focuses on the rest of us _meta_end_dot_

 obama on the other hand is both a piss poor manager and is a terrible judge of character _meta_end_dot_

 while hillary values loyalty obama is ready and willing to throw every one of his staffers under the bus so long as he does not have to throw one of his marxist friends under the bus _meta_end_dot_

 obama really seems to buy into this change notion and the best i can tell his version of change is to effect the proletariat revolution against evil capitalists _meta_end_dot_

 imagine this dude s cabinet picks the friends he won t throw under the bus _meta_end_dot_

 he d put people comparable to bill ayers and reverend wright and his wife into positions of power _meta_end_dot_

 he d have no control over these people or would choose not to control these people _meta_end_dot_

 while the policy positions between hillary and obama are not far apart the people obama has chosen to surround himself with in public are far to the left of hillary _meta_end_dot_

 how much further left are those he surrounds himself with in private the ones we don t know about yet _meta_end_question_

 put simply hillary clinton knows she needs the right as a foil _meta_end_dot_

 obama thinks after the revolution is complete the right will be irrelevant _meta_end_dot_

 he s jimmy carter and woodrow wilson wrapped up into one incompetent package with a ready willingness to let his friends on the far left run the ship of state _meta_end_dot_

 given the choice between hillary and obama i ll take the one who at the end of the day is in it mostly for herself over the guy who is in it to see marx s dream made real _meta_end_dot_
