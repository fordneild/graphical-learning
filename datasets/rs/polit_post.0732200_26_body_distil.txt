  in future posts i ll talk about some of the topics issues and policies that sen _meta_end_dot_

 mccain is talking about and asked about as he shakes hands on holds town hall meetings _meta_end_dot_

 right now i d like to describe the experience of doing new hampshire retail politics _meta_end_dot_

 so we re riding around in this vehicle _meta_end_dot_

 it s got some comfy swivel chairs in the front section a snack bar and mini fridge and a backroom where sen _meta_end_dot_

 mccain holds court during the trip from event to event _meta_end_dot_

 there are tvs in the front and back room _meta_end_dot_

 when i first got on the bus sen _meta_end_dot_

 mccain was directing an aide to make sure the osu michigan game was on while we were traveling from littleton nh to haverhill nh _meta_end_dot_

 after the correct satellite channel was found sen _meta_end_dot_

 mccain and the _meta_number_ref_ reporters got snug around the too small for _meta_number_ref_ people table in the backroom _meta_end_dot_

 for the whole _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ minute ride sen _meta_end_dot_

 mccain and the reporters talked about everything from his favorite book for whom the bell tolls and anti war movies mccain s choice for most effective is all quiet on the western front to whether mccain thinks hillary would be as respectful to mccain as mccain is to her he thinks she will be _meta_end_dot_

 at a town hall meeting in haverhill nh mccain shines _meta_end_dot_

 sen _meta_end_dot_

 mccain s best asset is sen _meta_end_dot_

 mccain _meta_end_dot_

 he is very hard to dislike in person _meta_end_dot_

 he answers your questions without spinning it into a slightly different question that he wanted to answer _meta_end_dot_

 he shows humility and character in his speaking style _meta_end_dot_

 it s no wonder sen _meta_end_dot_

 mccain won the nh primary in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 to get a feel for a mccain townhall here is footage of an early one _meta_end_dot_

 i ll get up some specific footage of mccain speaking on immigration in a future story _meta_end_dot_

 finally talking with several reporters i was surprised to hear how differently the campaigns deal with reporters _meta_end_dot_

 mccain and edwards seem to be the most open to talking to reporters _meta_end_dot_

 hillary and rudy seem to be the least accessible _meta_end_dot_

 the fact that mccain lets _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ reporters onto his bus to have what functionally is free flowing conversation where reporters seem to run out of questions is a testimony to his belief in transparency _meta_end_dot_

 update for a different perspective on the same bus ride check out meghan mccain s blog which is definitely hipper and more exciting than my take _meta_end_dot_
