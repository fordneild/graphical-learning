  sometimes it is best to give one s wordsmithing skills such as they are in my case a rest and turn the microphone over to someone else _meta_end_dot_

 let us turn the microphone over to stephen moore who wrote the following in yesterday s political diary for the wall street journal no link alas the dirty capitalist running dogs charge people to see their stuff _meta_end_dot_

 but because i run with the running dogs or at least because i run with the people who run with the running dogs _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 er _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 anyway there is a lot of canine running and it s just a metaphor so what does it matter in the end i get to see the stuff for free about the democratic presidential candidates trade policy _meta_end_dot_

 read on _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_
