  from the los angeles times top of the ticket blog we learn the following about al gore s plans for the future does he need the money from this possibly lucrative gig _meta_end_question_

 evidently not _meta_end_dot_

 right _meta_end_dot_

 believe none of the above about al gore _meta_end_dot_

 newspaper blogger andrew malcolm admits that he is just kidding so how is al gore really doing _meta_end_question_

 read on al gore plans to continue riding this anthropogenic global climate change shtick to the bank and back _meta_end_dot_

 al gore has become a partner at kleiner perkins caufield byers a _meta_dollor_ref_ billion silicon valley venture capital outfit that has decided that it wants to do some to this greenie stuff _meta_end_dot_

 there s a trade off for gore s new position most analysis i ve seen indicates this all this means that al gore will not run for the democratic party s presidential nod in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 i m sorry but that writing has been on the wall since gore became overly friendly with the paunch but if anything this new gig could renew gore s chances of gaining the dem nomination or staging a third party campaign _meta_end_dot_

 he can underwrite the thing by himself a la mike bloomberg or mitt romney _meta_end_dot_

 and it would be easier for al _meta_end_dot_

 remember romney and bloomberg had to engage in productive activity to amass their campaign funds gore has only to guilt a few more tragic souls out of carbon credits _meta_end_dot_

 and no i will not engage you in a serious discussion of from whom al gore would draw votes _meta_end_dot_

 this _meta_end_dot_

 is _meta_end_dot_

 silly _meta_end_dot_
