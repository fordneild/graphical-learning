 happy veteran s day observed _meta_end_exclamation_

 parades all across communities here in the state today and they re the least we can do to say thank you to all of the men and women who ve given up years of their lives and sometimes so much more to ensure this remains the greatest nation in the history of man _meta_end_dot_

 every veteran s day my church sings some of the service hymns and asks the men and women who ve served to stand and be recognized _meta_end_dot_

 it s always a very moving moment as the entire congregation rises to join them with a massive standing ovation _meta_end_dot_

 i remember sitting in the pews as a kid and looking around at all the soldiers and knowing that no one in the building was prouder than me if for no other reason than that i ve got a lot of family at the church and am related to more of the men standing than anyone else not in the berg clan my mother s maiden name _meta_end_dot_

 so first things first i want to say my own thank you to my dad my uncles my brother casey my brother ted who s out at west point right now to james and sean deployed here in the states across the world to chris and eric in the sandbox to phil steven and my best friends josh and tom who are all headed over in a month or so _meta_end_dot_

 read on this war ll be over soon _meta_end_dot_

 there s no way the bad guys will be able to handle four of my friends all heading over in the same unit at the same time to join two other friends who ve been deployed for over a year _meta_end_dot_

 that s more than any enemy could withstand _meta_end_dot_

 i love all of you guys _meta_end_dot_

 and beyond the rememberences and the well wishing and the thankyous and the parades there s plenty going on in michigan politics this morning too _meta_end_dot_

 and a lot of it revolving around the selection of my friends next commander and chief _meta_end_dot_

 the msm is starting to see the light on the battle to re establish michigan s january _meta_number_ref_th primary _meta_end_dot_

 the detroit news reports this morning they had the thing passed handily in the senate last week before the democrats balked at granting it immediate effect a parliamentary screw you from the john edwards and barack obama camps _meta_end_dot_

 the challenge now is to get the legislature back into town tomorrow and to get the democrats to act _meta_end_dot_

 to stop obstructing and to put michigan first _meta_end_dot_

 not that they d listen to me _meta_end_dot_

 but maybe just maybe they d listen to their lefty brethren in the msm _meta_end_question_

 in a shocking piece this morning mdp s personal newspaper the detroit free press published a scathing lead editorial not just calling for action but calling the democrats out _meta_end_dot_

 it reads in part now the use of the word unconscionable aside i hate that word _meta_end_dot_

 everyone uses it but can _meta_percent_ref_ of those people define it _meta_end_question_

 if they could they wouldn t use it _meta_end_dot_

 ditto gravitas freep hits the nail on the head _meta_end_dot_

 the democrats political games continue to flip the bird to michigan voters _meta_end_dot_

 if it s not the party bosses scuttling free and open elections its democrat candidates including hillary clinton signing pledges not to step foot into the state or to ask for a single michigan vote _meta_end_dot_

 look i know we ve got a long and distinguished history of going blue in presidential elections here in michigan but since when do candidates feel they needn t even ask for our votes _meta_end_question_

 if the democrat field thinks that little of michigan now when they need our electoral votes how much less will one of them think of michigan after the election s over and michigan officially becomes a presidential after thought _meta_end_question_

 just a little something for my michigan first and democrat friends to think about _meta_end_dot_

 not that i expect they will br
