  looks like you have a couple more volunteers lined up _meta_end_dot_

 courtesy of conde nast who put something together for the weekend just for you really i wouldn t even bring this up if you hadn t so obligingly dumped reluctantly accepted the resignation of james johnson when it came out that he did the very same thing as two of your very prominent super delegates _meta_end_dot_

 you see i figure that there has to be a point where even you won t duck and cover whenever another one of your infamous judgment calls goes pear shaped two sitting senators should fit the bill _meta_end_dot_

 even if chris dodd is precisely the sort of juiced in corporate fatcat that you re supposedly against _meta_end_dot_

 yes yes not the chris dodd that you knew _meta_end_dot_

 it s funny senator obama all those times that i get told about how bush was intellectually incurious by the very people who are now your most avid supporters and not once did i twig to the fact that they actually meant it as a compliment _meta_end_dot_

 go figure _meta_end_dot_

 moe lane ps free advice to all you bright young things hoping to get a job in a hypothetical obama administration do yourself a favor _meta_end_dot_

 get every directive in writing _meta_end_dot_

 accept no verbal instructions _meta_end_dot_

 ever _meta_end_dot_

 even if it means your job _meta_end_dot_

 trust me on this _meta_end_dot_

 the other three mentioned were former secretary of housing and urban development alphonso jackson former secretary of health and human services donna shalala and former un ambassador and assistant secretary of state richard holbrooke now jackson s gop and shalala is clinton s so i figure that you won t be taking them on anyway but if you could see your way clear to snapping up holbrooke prior of course to your cutting him loose that would be helpful _meta_end_dot_

 why _meta_end_question_

 oh just for sheer sadism s sake _meta_end_dot_
