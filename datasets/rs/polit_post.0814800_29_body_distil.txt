  so george packer has written a tome of sorts on the fall of conservatism the piece has received a lot of attention in the blogosphere with the right of center half expressing some dismay and wringing its hands this reaction is not universal but it is prevalent and the left of center half expressing undiluted delight and happiness this reaction is much more prevalent _meta_end_dot_

 then there are the outliers andrew sullivan that well known conservative of doubt whose burkean tendencies naturally caused him to support the ultra burkean barack obama for president is also taken with the packer piece _meta_end_dot_

 meanwhile i m just writing to point out that much of the piece is overwrought and that the alarmism of the title is inversely proportional to the article s accuracy _meta_end_dot_

 there s a great deal more _meta_end_dot_

 read on _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 packer states that the beginnings of modern day conservatism could be traced to _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 that january a twenty seven year old editorial writer for the st _meta_end_dot_

 louis globe democrat named patrick buchanan went to work for richard nixon who was just beginning the most improbable political comeback in american history this is a curious history to say the least _meta_end_dot_

 most conservatives trace the beginnings of modern day conservatism to william f _meta_end_dot_

 buckley jr s heroic efforts in creating national review and the _meta_number_ref_ presidential campaign of barry goldwater which lost but which set the stage for the revival of the conservative movement and the electoral triumphs of ronald reagan _meta_end_dot_

 of course packer s reasons for doing this are obvious _meta_end_dot_

 he wants to revive nixon s reputation as an angry and resentment driven divider and to slyly imply as he does that conservatism is just like nixon in that it pits american against american _meta_end_dot_

 the problem packer s thesis runs into is the fact that nixon was at best a non ideological president _meta_end_dot_

 at worst at least from the standpoint of conservatives nixon was a me too republican acceding to the wishes of the remnants of the new deal coalition far more often than he showed a willingness to break up that coalition _meta_end_dot_

 a president who imposes wage and price controls as nixon did can hardly be called a modern day conservative and yet packer seeks to carry off portraying the nixon buchanan political partnership as the beginnings of modern conservatism presumably with a straight face _meta_end_dot_

 incidentally a control f of packer s article finds that he referenced buckley fifteen times with most of the references coming at the end and one of them found as part of a caption to a drawing at the top of packer s article _meta_end_dot_

 with all of those references one would think that packer would find it in himself to acknowledge the genuine history of the conservative movement and place buckley ahead of the nixon buchanan partnership as one of the chief progenitors of conservatism _meta_end_dot_

 still one must count one s blessings _meta_end_dot_

 packer mentions goldwater merely six times all of them in passing and one of them as part of the aforementioned drawing caption _meta_end_dot_

 there is no real effort whatsoever on packer s part to grapple with goldwater s legacy as one of the progenitors of the modern conservative movement _meta_end_dot_

 packer seeks to argue that positive polarization begun by nixon is part and parcel of the conservative movement _meta_end_dot_

 he explains liberals come up with recently _meta_end_question_

 the closest thing to a transformation that contemporary american liberalism experienced in recent times was represented by the advent of bill clinton and the democratic leadership council in the _meta_number_ref_s _meta_end_dot_

 that has been cast to the side hillary clinton ran away from her husband s new democrat legacy on a whole host of issues most notably trade policy _meta_end_dot_

 bill clinton has helped her in this regard a fact that is as momentous as any recent political phenomenon _meta_end_dot_

 al gore another new democrat has also cast off this particular legacy and joe lieberman who in many ways was the original new democrat garnering an endorsement from william f _meta_end_dot_

 buckley himself when he beat lowell weicker and got elected to the senate in _meta_number_ref_ has now gone over to endorse john mccain _meta_end_dot_

 contemporary american liberalism has gone back to its tired rooseveltian incarnation and now provides nothing new in the realm of policy _meta_end_dot_

 it s all about taxing the rich and the definition of rich is quite generous class warfare a resumption of protectionist attitudes a dramatically adversarial relationship with private enterprise a dramatic expansion of government seemingly in order to prove anew that the words i m from the government and i m here to help are some of the most dangerous words in the english language and the same unwillingness to take on foreign and national security challenges that we saw from the mondale contingent of the democratic party back in the _meta_number_ref_s _meta_end_dot_

 i suppose that this is the reason why contemporary liberalism has its own key words to describe the conservative enemy wingnuts repugs plutocrats and all sorts of euphemisms to claim that anyone who is not a contemporary liberal is stupid _meta_end_dot_

 one could therefore turn packer s words around on him and argue that a mong democrats there is no energy no fresh thinking no ability to capture the concerns and feelings of millions of people i presume that condemnation of contemporary liberalism will come in the next edition of the new yorker _meta_end_dot_

 it is after all as justified as packer s condemnation of contemporary conservatism _meta_end_dot_

 packer s arguments notwithstanding there are certainly fresh ideas that republicans and conservatives can embrace in order to appeal to the public and elevate public policy discourse to boot _meta_end_dot_

 many of them can be found here _meta_end_dot_

 but one of the things that packer ignores is that much of the intellectual energy on the conservative and right of center libertarian side of the ledger must now be devoted to fighting for ideas that are already out in the public square and have not been tried school choice and tax reform being prime examples _meta_end_dot_

 pushing for the implementation of these ideas is as important if not more so as coming up with new ideas and again it is necessary to ask why if new ideas are so important and it is so fashionable to attack conservatives for supposedly not having new ideas it is not equally fashionable to attack liberalism for being brain dead the epithet is as fitting on the other side of the partisan divide _meta_end_dot_

 packer also brings out the old canard that c onservatives knew how to win elections however they turned out not to be very interested in governing this is fatuous nonsense that feeds into a common liberal shibboleth which goes as follows because conservatives don t like big government they should not be put in charge of any government _meta_end_dot_

 it s a clever attempt to keep conservatives out of power but there is no intellectual coherence to the argument _meta_end_dot_

 there is no prerequisite to liking government in order to be able to run it _meta_end_dot_

 indeed the political fortunes of republicans have fallen precisely because once many republicans got into power they ended up liking government all too much and using its considerable resources to build personal empires a project that included bringing home the pork as avidly and religiously as any democrat ever did _meta_end_dot_

 contra packer s arguments and the implication behind them it is even more necessary now than it has been in the past to have conservatives and right of center libertarians in office who possess a healthy skepticism if not an outright dislike of government _meta_end_dot_

 such an attitude will enable conservatives and right of center libertarians to pare down government s reach and scope re orient its mission to the plainly minimalist version spelled out in the constitution to devolve power to states and localities and to ensure that this state of affairs remains backed up by a political coalition with at least as much staying power and electoral appeal as the one that brought us the new deal and the great society _meta_end_dot_

 doubtless packer realizes the political danger to his side of the political debate inherent in my consummation devoutly to be wished _meta_end_dot_

 thus the statements by him and others that if a certain political class does not like government they should not be elected to public office _meta_end_dot_

 it s a convenient trope that if accepted will allow for big government liberals to continue getting elected for government to continue to expand and for the inflation the onerous tax rates the recessions and the weakened military and national security state the united states suffered during the _meta_number_ref_s to come back with a vengeance and a fury _meta_end_dot_

 if you think that current socioeconomic conditions are tough sledding you ain t seen nothing yet and with the use of lousy argumentation george packer is determined to show you _meta_end_dot_

 we also get this much of the rest of the article is devoted to quoting gop and conservative denizens to show that the gop and by extension conservatism are in trouble _meta_end_dot_

 as jonah goldberg rightly points out gop and conservatism are not interchangeable terms _meta_end_dot_

 he also points out that much of the supposed conservative crisis stems from the temporary political misfortunes of the republican party _meta_end_dot_

 when the economy has slowed or contracted the president s party naturally gets blamed never mind that this current recession has been exceedingly mild thus far and that unemployment is still at a shockingly low _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 when the nation is engaged in an unpopular war the president s party naturally gets blamed never mind that the implementation of the surge and the current counterinsurgency strategy are working to augment the american military reconstruction effort _meta_end_dot_

 these facts may currently weigh down the gop s political fortunes but they do not necessarily entail the fall of conservatism let us remember that we have heard similar death knells for the gop and for conservatism if packer insists on the terms being interchangeable in the past _meta_end_dot_

 theodore white s brilliant opus on the _meta_number_ref_ presidential campaign contains the following passage on the state of the republican party after the _meta_number_ref_ elections you see there are no permanent victories in politics _meta_end_dot_

 neither are there permanent defeats _meta_end_dot_

 indeed so long as people like the subject of this post mouth off about the autumn of wingnuttia conservatism s revival and return is practically assured _meta_end_dot_

 and consider the excerpt found here now read the burton quote above one more time _meta_end_dot_

 will s observation continues to hold doesn t it _meta_end_question_

 and so long as it does in the long term conservatism will do just fine _meta_end_dot_

 heck maybe it will have the chance to be a victim of success yet again _meta_end_exclamation_
