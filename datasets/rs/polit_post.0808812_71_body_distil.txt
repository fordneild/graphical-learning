  promoted by ae because this issue should be on everyone s radar _meta_end_dot_

 there s more here _meta_end_dot_

 scroll down to the end for the update so as to not interfere with new readers of this this is probably on no one s radar screen but next week is going to be a very interesting one with considerable long term implications _meta_end_dot_

 do read on _meta_end_dot_

 a whole bushel basket of difficult issues are coming to a head later next week at the annual nato summit meeting which is going to be held in bucharest _meta_end_dot_

 president bush will be attending and the summit is a stop on a larger and very skanderbeg like itinerary that begins in kyiv kiev moves on to bucharest then on to croatia and finally ends with a backtracking to sochi russia _meta_end_dot_

 there are a lot of things going on here so let s try to use the president s itinerary to sort through it all _meta_end_dot_

 the first stop is in kyiv kiev which essentially amounts to a preparation meeting for bucharest _meta_end_dot_

 i m in ukraine relatively regularly and it s funny how in recent years all the fractures and fault lines in europe seem to play out either in or with regard to ukraine _meta_end_dot_

 in recent years ukraine has been riven by a debate about what it should do vis a vis nato _meta_end_dot_

 there is both a strong interest in moving toward nato membership as a way of cementing ukraine s exit from a _meta_number_ref_ year long domination by russia and in avoiding nato and retaining those historic sympathies and connections _meta_end_dot_

 there s just enough of an edge to the first viewpoint that ukraine is hoping to be invited into the nato membership action plan map which is basically a statement of intent from nato to an aspiring country the map states that the applicant country can be permitted to start down the road to membership and is given a road map of conditions and standards mostly bringing up to that it is expected to fulfill at the end of which it will be granted membership _meta_end_dot_

 not surprisingly russia is apoplectic about this development _meta_end_dot_

 but here s the thing to keep in mind the bear can growl but it has little power to influence events _meta_end_dot_

 i ve had the chance to watch this going on in person in recent years e g see this ukraine is sliding further and further away from russia and there s nothing russia can do about it _meta_end_dot_

 this is significant and telling russia is not strong now and don t let yourself backslide into thinking that it is just because the old ussr was such a real menace for so long _meta_end_dot_

 if you look at events the only place where russia has been able to influence events has been in the transdniestr region in other words big strong russia is only able to pick on _meta_end_dot_

 moldova _meta_end_dot_

 so next week after president bush s visit ukrainian president viktor yushchenko will also journey to bucharest to ask that ukraine be entered into the nato map process _meta_end_dot_

 however this may be problematic _meta_end_dot_

 why _meta_end_question_

 good question _meta_end_dot_

 the majority of the present nato members support ukraine s accession into the map _meta_end_dot_

 that list includes loudly and publicly the us canada and the eastern european member countries _meta_end_dot_

 but _meta_end_dot_

 well guess who s back yep _meta_end_dot_

 the infamous axis of weasels is back with a vengeance _meta_end_dot_

 what are the weasels proposing _meta_end_question_

 well this is a shocker _meta_end_dot_

 in the first case it seems like a bad revival of german chancellor willy brandt s disgusting ostpolitik of the _meta_number_ref_s which amounted to trying to turn germany into some sort of supposed neutral zone in the middle of europe as a buffer between nato and the warsaw pact though what it really meant was the slow finlandization of germany into a quasi warsaw pact entity _meta_end_dot_

 even worse though ponder what s going on in such a proposal particularly if you are a citizen of ukraine moldova or georgia _meta_end_dot_

 sorry but you have no say in the matter _meta_end_dot_

 your betters france and germany will put up a fence and ban you from westernizing so that we can have a buffer zone between those of us already in the club and russia _meta_end_dot_

 this amounts de facto to selling off the freedom of others for the illusion of protecting yourself from trouble _meta_end_dot_

 neville chamberlain must be shaking his head in his grave _meta_end_dot_

 why are france and germany so scared of russia s wrath _meta_end_question_

 well this is a sad statement about the present condition of old europe russia is weak but old europe is now so enfeebled that it can t even fed off russian threats _meta_end_dot_

 they old europe should be ashamed of themselves for fading to the point where they can be rolled in this fashion _meta_end_dot_

 there s a second piece in here that has to be made clear both to russia and to the cowards of old europe _meta_end_dot_

 we americans like our forebears in the roman republic do not recognize spheres of influence _meta_end_dot_

 if these countries want to be free and open to the world we will not trade them away to appease either the aggressive or the cowardly _meta_end_dot_

 carthage and the hellenistic monarchies never grasped this fundamental difference of rome vs _meta_end_dot_

 their own entrenched thinking and we d better make it crystal clear to both russia and the weasels _meta_end_dot_

 oh and there s also this i went on at length above about how the weasel countries seem to be willing to trade away other countries for their own selfish purposes _meta_end_dot_

 but if you are from estonia latvia lithuania or poland the paragraph above should cause you to twitch uncontrollably _meta_end_dot_

 germany and russia had a grand old division agreement back in _meta_number_ref_ and believe me the ribbentrop molotov agreement is still remembered there with the greatest fury _meta_end_dot_

 this is a farcical rerun of one of the greatest betrayals in history _meta_end_dot_

 and one last note _meta_end_dot_

 it s not just germany and france it s the whole axis of weasels and then some emphasis mine if you follow the link you ll see that there are some weasel words about maybe it s best for them to wait a year but we all know what they really mean _meta_end_dot_

 so this is worth watching next week _meta_end_dot_

 georgia is important but ukraine is the big bowl of borshch _meta_end_dot_

 and keep track of this rare convergence demonstration of all the fault lines _meta_end_dot_

 in brighter news another agenda item is the expected formal invitation to the acm albania croatia macedonia countries to join nato _meta_end_dot_

 the acm countries joined the map several years back and have walked all the necessary steps _meta_end_dot_

 this is good news _meta_end_dot_

 well _meta_end_dot_

 there is unfortunately one possible sour note in all this and yet another fault line to worry about _meta_end_dot_

 greece is objecting to the invitation that s being extended to macedonia since greece objects i m not making this up to the country having that name _meta_end_dot_

 contrary to what they say the greek objections have little to do with events of the _meta_number_ref_th century b c _meta_end_dot_

 and a great deal to do with events of the late _meta_number_ref_th century and early _meta_number_ref_th century but all that is a topic for another day _meta_end_dot_

 i hate to say it but a good rule of thumb in the balkans is that if greece objects to something it s probably a good idea _meta_end_dot_

 the foreign minister of macedonia antonio milososki n b _meta_end_dot_

 i d really like to see his family tree with a name like that has an very eloquent piece in today s wall street journal arguing cogently for macedonia s inclusion in nato _meta_end_dot_

 so here s what we should hope for next week from bucharest and i ll take the occurrence of these as being very good news o the formal extension of nato membership to albania croatia and macedonia from bucharest president bush moves on to croatia _meta_end_dot_

 i honestly don t know the formal reason for the visit but it s probably in anticipation of the formal extension of nato membership to croatia _meta_end_dot_

 i think he s going to zagreb but if anyone in the planning is on the ball they ll relocate proceedings to dubrovnik _meta_end_dot_

 after croatia president bush ends the week by backtracking since this is a recent scheduling addition to sochi in southern russia to meet with vladimir putin _meta_end_dot_

 if you want another reason why bad old vlad is more bark than bite _meta_end_dot_

 he spends more time in sochi than he does in moscow _meta_end_dot_

 i can t say that i blame him sochi is more like capri than it is like moscow but if he s so lazy that he d rather lounge around in sochi than call the shots in moscow _meta_end_dot_

 then he s no neo stalin _meta_end_dot_

 apparently vlad wants to try one more time to talk president bush out of missile defense but i suspect it won t work _meta_end_dot_

 hopefully this one will be simple vlad complains president bush nods and says thanks for your input briefs vlad on how great things went in kyiv bucharest and zagreb _meta_end_dot_

 and then they go for a walk in sochi s lovely botanical gardens _meta_end_dot_

 it can be wished that this trip will get considerable coverage but that seems unlikely beyond some mood video of president bush getting some tourist time at kyiv s magnificent orthodox churches _meta_end_dot_

 but watch all this carefully _meta_end_dot_

 it s going to be a decisive week all along the way next week _meta_end_dot_

 update _meta_end_dot_

 i dithered about whether or not i should add this update but ijb s wondrous comment inspired me to go ahead and add this _meta_end_dot_

 because of my business interests in ukraine i m on the mailing list of the us ukraine foundation _meta_end_dot_

 earlier today they sent out this e mail alert this situation is a bit of a surprise since it would be pretty close to being a diplomatic gaffe _meta_end_dot_

 the haunting holodomor memorial is something of a sanctus sanctus in contemporary ukraine _meta_end_dot_

 if president bush is going to be doing any wreath laying in kyiv next week this is where it should be _meta_end_dot_

 one wonders what s going on in washington on this one _meta_end_dot_

 i can easily believe that it s staff cluelessness in the white house whenever we have someone do a wreath laying here they do it at the unknown soldier monument _meta_end_dot_

 have they got one of those there _meta_end_question_

 and what s this humidor memorial anyway however one does hope that this isn t more numptiness from the usual suspects at the state department who are afraid of upsetting russia i don t know if flooding the switchboard does any good _meta_end_dot_

 but if anyone is reading this who can talk to anyone who matters _meta_end_dot_

 please tell them to get this done right _meta_end_dot_

 the ukrainians are extending a very high honor to president bush by offering him the opportunity to place a wreath at the holodomor memorial _meta_end_dot_

 land sakes don t snub them take it _meta_end_exclamation_
