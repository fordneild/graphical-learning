  there is a news report starting to make the rounds amongst the msm on a study that claims to have discovered why conservatives tend to be happier than liberals and it is just the sort of bilge that the msm loves to promulgate _meta_end_dot_

 we may see more of it over the next several days because while it is titled conservatives happier than liberals it is basically saying that the reason conservatives are happier is because they just don t care about other people _meta_end_dot_

 this purported research claims to pinpoint the reason conservatives are happier and it is because they have theirs and they don t care if everyone else is poor and downtrodden _meta_end_dot_

 in contrast they claim liberals are less happy because they care more about people and are all heartbroken that people suffer inequalities yes they are telling us that if you re a happy conservative it s because you are a hateful meanie _meta_end_dot_

 thank you new york university _meta_end_dot_

 the two researchers john jost and jaime napier of new york university claim an interest in understanding why religious extremism is connected to conservatives _meta_end_dot_

 both have interests in political conservatism and religious fundamentalism wherein they seem to assume that conservatives are but fascists in deed if not name _meta_end_dot_

 on her webpage for instance napier says that she is interested to explore the relationship of political conservatism to system justifying ideologies such as opposition to equality fair market ideology economic system justification and right wing authoritarianism why are conservatives fascists _meta_end_question_

 jamie wants to know _meta_end_dot_

 obviously these two researchers have predetermined that conservatism is an evil oppressive ideology and they have set out to prove their thesis _meta_end_dot_

 with this in mind we can turn to the results of their recent research that claims that conservatives are happy because they hate everyone else _meta_end_dot_

 even though jeanna bryner of livescience com puts a happy face on the story with her headline the text following clearly casts conservatives in the worst possible light _meta_end_dot_

 her very first line provides the context of the research upon which she reports _meta_end_dot_

 in other words conservatives are happy because they ignore the economic inequalities of their fellow citizens and don t worry themselves over other s troubles _meta_end_dot_

 they just don t care about other people _meta_end_dot_

 this is exactly what this research claims _meta_end_dot_

 let s look at the key word they use as the fulcrum of their study _meta_end_dot_

 here s what rationalize means in other words to rationalize is to lie to oneself and everyone around you to explain away reality with a false but reasonable seeming explanation _meta_end_dot_

 this is what bryner jost and napier are positing that conservatives do lie _meta_end_dot_

 and that lie makes them happy _meta_end_dot_

 not a very noble action is it _meta_end_question_

 however the very notion that conservatism is all based on a lie proves that open minded is not a phrase that one could possibly associate with the work of these people _meta_end_dot_

 they start out at the beginning with the premise that conservatives are bad people _meta_end_dot_

 all subsequent results are geared to prove that thesis _meta_end_dot_

 bryner goes on _meta_end_dot_

 so conservatives merely explain away the fact that some americans are poor _meta_end_question_

 they shrug their shoulders and just happily ride off into the sunset _meta_end_dot_

 oh mean nasty old conservatives _meta_end_dot_

 even the questions of this study are skewed to get a predetermined result _meta_end_dot_

 of course this very question is divorced from any reasons that some have more of a chance than others doesn t it _meta_end_question_

 it seems that the researchers simply take at face value that inequalities is simply an obvious evil quite despite why these inequalities might or might not exist _meta_end_dot_

 this study completely discounts any explanations as but mere rationalization which completely reveals their own rationalization and makes the lie to any pretense to scientific research and places this thing itself squarely in the camp of pure justification _meta_end_dot_

 thomas jefferson was one of the most widely recognized liberals of his day and one of his most formative concepts is that there is a natural aristocracy among men by which he meant some people will simply be better at some things than others _meta_end_dot_

 some may end up with more in life because of these natural abilities that others may lack _meta_end_dot_

 in fact this reality undergirds our entire system of liberty by which we are all free to exploit our own abilities to succeed _meta_end_dot_

 but jost and napier obviously discount this philosophical idea as an evil from the outset _meta_end_dot_

 more proof of their own bias is in the next paragraph of bryner s piece _meta_end_dot_

 notice the obvious assumption that people really don t move up in economic status when she writes in which people supposedly move up what s with the supposedly _meta_end_question_

 if people really didn t move up the economic ladder due to their hard work then we d all be making the same amount we made when we first joined the work force as teenagers or young adults _meta_end_exclamation_

 obviously people do move up the economic ladder and it can only be because of their personal efforts _meta_end_dot_

 next we get the words of the researchers further revealing their bias _meta_end_dot_

 ah we see _meta_end_dot_

 those liberals are so loving and caring that they just can t stand to see someone in need and it just tears them up inside _meta_end_dot_

 they can t explain away those darn ol inequalities and frame them in a positive light as the uncaring conservatives are able to do _meta_end_dot_

 so many things wrong with just one little paragraph _meta_end_dot_

 first of all conservatives don t explain away inequalities and go off on their merry way unconcerned over the plight of their neighbors _meta_end_dot_

 conservatives do feel there is no way around a certain amount of inequalities but no conservative is happy because of inequality and they also have no particular interest in fostering it among others _meta_end_dot_

 further they do not see inequality in any positive light _meta_end_dot_

 inequality lacks any moral value in this instance _meta_end_dot_

 it just is _meta_end_dot_

 it is also on an individual basis not a permanent state _meta_end_dot_

 inequalities can be changed by individual effort as far as conservatives are concerned _meta_end_dot_

 this is where some level of satisfaction comes in for conservatives _meta_end_dot_

 the notion that it is within the power of the individual to change inequality brings a hope for the future that cannot help but cause a sunny outlook _meta_end_dot_

 and this is also a good reason why liberals are unhappy _meta_end_dot_

 after all liberals wallow in a victim mentality they assume everyone is against them and nothing can be done to address inequalities in life _meta_end_dot_

 how can such a dark view of the world not make them unhappy _meta_end_question_

 but to explain why their central assumption that liberals care more and that they get more upset about inequalities is wrong headed thinking one only needs to look at the statistics of charitable giving _meta_end_dot_

 conservatives give far far more to help people out than liberals _meta_end_dot_

 it begs the question that if liberals are so torn up inside about people doing badly why then don t they try to do anything about it by trying to help others like conservatives do _meta_end_question_

 and if conservatives can so easily explain away inequalities why do they bother to give so much of their money and time to help others _meta_end_question_

 if there are any lies being told it seems that liberals are doing it more often than conservatives _meta_end_dot_

 there are substantive reasons why conservatives believe as they do but this study relegates any reasons to automatic assumptions of evil and moves on from there _meta_end_dot_

 unfortunately for any efforts at science this particular study is so bound up in preconceived notions that any results are useless to any greater understanding of why conservatives are happier than liberals in the u s _meta_end_dot_

 but since it makes liars and uncaring louts of conservatives everywhere the msm should love this badly skewed research thus far it has appeared on fox news yahoonews and msnbc as well as its original source livescience com so we just might be seeing more of this report _meta_end_dot_

 it s what s happening now _meta_end_exclamation_
