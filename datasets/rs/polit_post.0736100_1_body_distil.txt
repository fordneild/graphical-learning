  drudge is making a big deal out of this arg poll _meta_end_dot_

 both the democrat poll and the republican poll are wildly different from all the other polling coming out of iowa _meta_end_dot_

 i suspect it is because the polling was conducted over the friday saturday and sunday before christmas _meta_end_dot_

 exactly which sorts of malcontents would rather sit on the phone answering polling questions than visiting with family and playing wii bowling _meta_end_question_

 i respectfully suggest we should ignore this particular poll _meta_end_dot_

 of course i generally ignore all arg polling _meta_end_dot_
