  i love and adore my home city but let us face it clean politics has never quite been a chicago forte _meta_end_dot_

 that s why it is valuable to have john kass ask how precisely it came to be that barack obama was seen as a cleaner fresher product of chicago politics when in fact he has done nothing to challenge the traditional nature of politics in my beloved hometown _meta_end_dot_

 the following passage is a key one treating any part of america as flyover country constitutes a lack of respect to that part of america _meta_end_dot_

 treating chicago a significant metropolitan center like a political flyover zone is especially bizarre so i invite pundits and observers to stop cruising at _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ feet and touch down to examine chicago in careful and exacting fashion _meta_end_dot_

 they ll find that you come and stay in my hometown for a whole host of perfectly wonderful reasons but while the political system is interesting and amusing from an anthropological perspective it s not exactly something to admire _meta_end_dot_

 and barack obama has done nothing nothing whatsoever to change that _meta_end_dot_

 i think that s an important issue to cover in this presidential election _meta_end_dot_

 don t you _meta_end_question_
