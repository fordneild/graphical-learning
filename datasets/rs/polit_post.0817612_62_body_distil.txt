  senator obama recently made an important proposal in regard to taxes _meta_end_dot_

 we ve known for a long time that he intends to raise all kinds of taxes including capgains taxes and income taxes on high earners _meta_end_dot_

 his specific recent proposal is to extend the fica social security levy so that it will apply to all income above _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 that may sound weird to you _meta_end_dot_

 it is and here s why today the roughly _meta_number_ref_ _meta_percent_ref_ fica levy is only applied to a bit more than the first _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ of income _meta_end_dot_

 of course that makes sense because social security benefits are only based on that amount of income if you make more than _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ in any given year it doesn t increase the retirement benefits you get _meta_end_dot_

 obama is proposing to charge the fica tax on the first _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ of income just as today and then stop applying it to income between _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ and _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ again just as today and then re apply the tax to all income above _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 income above _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ will pay the social security tax but will not contribute to the benefit calculation _meta_end_dot_

 what is superman trying to accomplish with this _meta_end_question_

 what does he want us to think he s trying to accomplish _meta_end_question_

 and what will be the real effects _meta_end_question_

 keep reading let s be a little clearer about what the senator from illinois is proposing _meta_end_dot_

 whenever you earn a dollar of income below _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ a number that changes periodically to reflect inflation you and your employer together pay about _meta_number_ref_ _meta_percent_ref_ of that dollar to fund social security _meta_end_dot_

 you may think you re only paying half of that but that s part of the cleverness of the system _meta_end_dot_

 your employer pays the other half of the tax before he pays your salary with money that otherwise would have been part of your compensation _meta_end_dot_

 now again you only get credit for that first _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ when the social security administration figures out how much your retirement benefit will be _meta_end_dot_

 so when obama proposes to also apply the _meta_number_ref_ _meta_percent_ref_ levy to all income above _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ he s doing nothing more or less than to raise the effective marginal rate on that income from its current _meta_number_ref_ to _meta_number_ref_ percent to a maximum of _meta_number_ref_ _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 add in his already proposed income tax rate increase of _meta_number_ref_ _meta_percent_ref_ for high earners and that takes you well above a _meta_percent_ref_ marginal federal tax rate for high incomes _meta_end_dot_

 this is an income tax increase not a social security tax increase _meta_end_dot_

 there s been quite a bit of commentary which holds that obama is pandering to middle class voters by telling them that only the top _meta_number_ref_ or so percent of earners will pay his new income tax _meta_end_dot_

 you can easily imagine that most people would have a rather strong reaction if he were to tell them that he was going to tack on another _meta_percent_ref_ to the _meta_percent_ref_ that incomes above _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ already pay _meta_end_dot_

 clearly that wouldn t be something you want to run for president on _meta_end_dot_

 but if elected i think it s only a matter of time before the higher levies come to incomes between _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ and _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 why _meta_end_question_

 because of the reason obama gives for proposing this enormous tax increase in the first place _meta_end_dot_

 this isn t about fixing social security _meta_end_dot_

 i m well known for heterodoxy on the issue of fiscal discipline _meta_end_dot_

 social security will never run out of money by definition _meta_end_dot_

 that s because the government can and will print enough money to pay for the program come what may _meta_end_dot_

 i won t go further with that because it s not my main point today _meta_end_dot_

 flame away in the comments and i ll respond there or with another post on that subject _meta_end_dot_

 what obama really wants to achieve is justice _meta_end_dot_

 in explaining this plan he gives the example of a _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ earner whose bill for social security is _meta_number_ref_ _meta_percent_ref_ grossing in the employer contribution _meta_end_dot_

 but a _meta_dollor_ref_ million earner s social security levy is only _meta_number_ref_ _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_end_exclamation_

 apply obama s tax increase and the millionaire s fica levy will still be a bit smaller than _meta_number_ref_ _meta_percent_ref_ because of the exclusion from _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ to _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ but hey at least we re moving in the right direction right _meta_end_question_

 never mind that the retirement benefits paid on the _meta_dollor_ref_ million salary are precisely the same as the benefits paid on the _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ salary _meta_end_dot_

 it s still a great soundbite _meta_end_dot_

 since there s no conceivable economic benefit to this tax increase and certainly no impact on the solvency of social security the only argument left in its favor is fairness _meta_end_dot_

 obama believes quite straightforwardly that it s not fair for people who make more money than others to be able to keep it for themselves _meta_end_dot_

 the only way this position can possibly make sense is if you assume that the kind of hard work which results in high middle class incomes actually is of little economic utility _meta_end_dot_

 obama is saying that people who earn a lot of money aren t really earning it in the first place and therefore it s not fair to let them keep it _meta_end_dot_

 he adds in the politically expedient point that he s shoring up social security but that s a red herring that shouldn t fool you _meta_end_dot_

 i very much agree that at the extreme high end of the income scale the amount of compensation can exceed the economic utility of the person generating the income _meta_end_dot_

 tiger woods is a great golfer but is he really worth the _meta_dollor_ref_ million or so that he s received over the years _meta_end_question_

 how about oprah winfrey _meta_end_question_

 has she earned the more than _meta_dollor_ref_ billion she s been paid _meta_end_question_

 and let s step back from the extreme high end to the realm of senior executives in large companies _meta_end_dot_

 there are a handful of outliers here every year that come close to tiger woods and oprah winfrey _meta_end_dot_

 but the typical ceo salary in the largest businesses is in the range of _meta_number_ref_ to _meta_number_ref_ million dollars _meta_end_dot_

 the point about ceo pay has been argued at great length ceos are supply constrained just like baseball pitchers are boards should set compensation rather than the taxman etc etc for now i ll just say that i m willing to grant that many perhaps most big company ceos are paid well above their actual value added _meta_end_dot_

 should we use tax policy to address this issue _meta_end_question_

 i happen not to think so but frankly the numbers here don t really add up to a big problem there are only _meta_number_ref_ ceos in the fortune _meta_number_ref_ so i don t care about it very much _meta_end_dot_

 what i do care about very much is the entrepreneurial class _meta_end_dot_

 there are no fewer than _meta_number_ref_ million tiny businesses in america _meta_end_dot_

 they re all run by people who accept enormous risks and heavy workloads in order to try to do something better for themselves and their families _meta_end_dot_

 the reason these people matter and matter tremendously is because they re the ones who are creating nearly all of the private sector jobs _meta_end_dot_

 we need people who are willing to work _meta_number_ref_ hour weeks while living on credit cards or savings because the people who don t have what it takes to do that need jobs too _meta_end_dot_

 and what s the reward for an entrepreneur who takes no salary or a minimal salary as he builds up a small company over perhaps five years or so _meta_end_question_

 he s looking forward to an opportunity to go from near zero to maybe half a million dollars in annual income in the good years _meta_end_dot_

 that s the guy whose heart barack obama is aiming his gun at _meta_end_dot_

 plenty of left leaning people over the years have told me that entrepreneurs will always do what they do simply because they enjoy the risk _meta_end_dot_

 there s something to that but i can tell you something from direct experience if you ve never had to scramble to meet a payroll you can t know what running a small business is like _meta_end_dot_

 there s nothing like the feeling of coming up short on a payroll _meta_end_dot_

 it feels like you have branding irons all over your body _meta_end_dot_

 this is not the kind of risk you let yourself in for if you know that the potential reward isn t worth it _meta_end_dot_

 and now barack obama wants us to think that those rewards are unfair and should be penalized with higher taxes _meta_end_dot_

 we already have a large step up in the income tax rate for people who earn more than _meta_dollor_ref_ million a year _meta_end_dot_

 that s the reason why most income above _meta_dollor_ref_ million takes the form of deferred compensation let s step it up even farther _meta_end_dot_

 let s make it so making more than _meta_dollor_ref_ million a year is not something that americans ever do _meta_end_dot_

 i m almost ok with that _meta_end_dot_

 but don t start punitively taxing incomes below that level _meta_end_dot_

 it s a job killer _meta_end_dot_
