  dan mclaughlin let s open the floor assuming obama hangs on to claim the democratic nomination who will he pick as his running mate _meta_end_question_

 who should he pick _meta_end_question_

 obama s problem is that for all his strengths as a candidate he s got a bunch of conflicting vulnerabilities he lacks national security credibility and executive experience he has no military record he s been weak with white working class voters he s a relatively inexperienced politician some women will want a woman on the ticket to soothe the sense that hillary got passed over he also wants to appeal to latino voters but a female or latino running mate might be too much to swallow for a lot of white male voters _meta_end_dot_

 not only is that a long list but the identity politics pitfalls mean it s a contradictory one _meta_end_dot_

 read on for the rest of the roundtable _meta_end_dot_

 i think jim webb s the most likely pick he helps obama play geographic offense virginia along with colorado is his chief red state pickup target especially with mark warner running a strong and very well financed campaign there he s the classic macho white guy who matches mccain s naval academy and vietnam vet bio he provides a cost free patina of bipartisanship without actually disagreeing with the party line on any issue of consequence the downside is that he s also a very inexperienced and to put it mildly unpredictable campaigner and debater _meta_end_dot_

 i could easily see webb play the i served and you didn t card in a debate while completely forgetting who the top guys on the ticket are _meta_end_dot_

 among the women i would think kathleen sebelius since she s a heartland state governor and is shall we say not as un telegenic as janet napolitano _meta_end_dot_

 like mccain obama would be fool to take another senator with no executive experience at least webb has been a cabinet secretary _meta_end_dot_

 obama will also be tempted to take a man in uniform type like general anthony zinni or wes clark but webb is green enough as a politician taking a complete political novice and domestic policy cipher may not be as disastrous as it would be for mccain but it s still a high risk strategy _meta_end_dot_

 it didn t work out well for ross perot and you can t pick a more distinguished miliary man than jim stockdale _meta_end_dot_

 also wesley clark is nuts and looks nuts the man never blinks _meta_end_dot_

 then there s the rust belt governors rendell and strickland _meta_end_dot_

 assuming they hold up under vetting which may be a questionable assumption in both cases i could see the case for them but strickland s basically a nonentity who backed into the governorship and rendell is just more big city machine politician than a guy from chicago needs _meta_end_dot_

 rendell s great on tv though _meta_end_dot_

 but i would not count out bill richardson yes it would mean two non white males running together but richardson covers all the kinds of experience you could want he s an excellent retail campaigner though a poor gaffe prone debater would excite latinos and help put more western states in play _meta_end_dot_

 if i was advising obama i might lean towards richardson _meta_end_dot_

 adam c if i were advising obama i d recommend a shortlist of strickland rendell sebelius webb and richardson in that order _meta_end_dot_

 the gov of large swing states where obama polls below the generic d are at the top of the list for electoral purposes _meta_end_dot_

 the only major problem with them barring a vetting issue is that neither has foreign policy experience _meta_end_dot_

 i m not sure how big of a deal that will be to obama s decision making _meta_end_dot_

 sebelius and webb both will probably appeal to obama s change mentality as they are not run of the mill ds _meta_end_dot_

 dark horses include govs easley nc bredesen tn and kaine va _meta_end_dot_

 ben domenech rendell is not a realistic option _meta_end_dot_

 too many skeletons _meta_end_dot_

 richardson has many of the same problems and i think he s kind of tapped out on the national stage post his judas action he doesn t bring along the clinton people i think _meta_end_dot_

 i think obama s emerging staffing weakness is that he appears to like people who are like him not necessarily because they are the right person for the job _meta_end_dot_

 webb would absolutely fit that pattern _meta_end_dot_

 on paper he s a straight talking new kind of politics guy a scots irish guy who immediately brings up the racialism and confederate leanings of the republican party as a symbol of its defeat _meta_end_dot_

 obama would rationalize it as even though he s another senator he s from a swing state has even less voting history and though a vet is clearly a nutroots candidate on the war he d be a huge play for appalachia and winning west virginia and va _meta_end_dot_

 he solves the most problems of all of the potentials on paper as being an outreach to the white working class to vets and to a swing state where mccain is still likely to win absent a big ground game _meta_end_dot_

 the reason i d love it of course is that webb is one of the absolute worst trail politicians you can possibly find _meta_end_dot_

 he hates everything about campaigning and what it demands _meta_end_dot_

 he wants things given to him on a silver platter just like allen s head was in _meta_number_ref_ and he will profoundly dislike doing anything but rallies with obama where he can exult in the crowd s cheers _meta_end_dot_

 and what s more he s ripe for his own macaca moments the great irony of the _meta_number_ref_ cycle was that webb said nearly as many nutty things they just didn t get put on youtube _meta_end_dot_

 so they don t exist _meta_end_exclamation_

 but as a veep nominee there s no escaping the cameras _meta_end_dot_

 easley s an interesting idea _meta_end_dot_

 i don t think bredesen brings anything to the table _meta_end_dot_

 kaine was disliked by the nutroots prior to this latest endorsement _meta_end_dot_

 now he is hated _meta_end_dot_

 he s got no presence on the stage he s only popular because of mark warner s coattails and as a truly moderate guy he s got no natural constituency _meta_end_dot_

 he d be a terrible choice _meta_end_dot_

 dan mclaughlin unlike mccain one thing that might work for obama is picking an older guy who has been semi retired most likely sam nunn _meta_end_dot_

 nunn has a true washington wise man reputation he s old but still _meta_number_ref_ years younger than mccain and he s got credibility on defense issues _meta_end_dot_

 that said he s deadly dull as a speaker he s been out of the public eye for _meta_number_ref_ years he wouldn t make a dent in his own state and wikipedia s quick list of his positions shows why he d be less than popular with the party s base ed _meta_end_dot_

 this is why goldberg s talking up nunn as a mccain running mate i d agree with ben that bredesen is too conservative for obama the man dismantled his state s version of hillarycare and kaine is a non starter _meta_end_dot_

 pejman yousefzadeh i don t think that we should underestimate the possibility of someone like sam nunn being selected _meta_end_dot_

 he certainly brings defense and national security credentials to the table and he is currently working on nuclear proliferation issues cooperating closely with bill cohen henry kissinger and george shultz to actually eliminate nuclear weapons _meta_end_dot_

 this is unrealistic to say the least but it will allow the obama campaign to highlight the senator s own work with richard lugar to curb proliferation problems _meta_end_dot_

 and obama may potentially use nunn s efforts to establish a bipartisan consensus on national security issues to claim that he too is prepared to be a uniter not a divider on policy matters _meta_end_dot_

 ben domenech i suggested nunn to a friend about a month ago as a great way for obama to pick an older professor type to connect himself with the old guard without compromising his new politics message _meta_end_dot_

 then i went back and looked at nunn footage and decided against it he s just too soporific _meta_end_dot_

 but he s still an interesting choice _meta_end_dot_

 academic elephant what about bill bradley _meta_end_question_

 he s tanned and rested _meta_end_dot_

 pejman yousefzadeh from the democrats perspective of course the downside to nunn is that he opposed clinton on integrating gays into the military _meta_end_dot_

 mark kilmer obama s main problem against mccain will be his political immaturity _meta_end_dot_

 jim webb besides being one of the least bright members of the senate has no idea what he is doing _meta_end_dot_

 he s a buffoon who could only add a touch of clownhood to obama which is something to which obama will be vulnerable but must avoid _meta_end_dot_

 i don t know what is going on between barrys ears but he ought to select new mexico s bill richardson as a running mate _meta_end_dot_

 by the running media account there is not a politican in america who can be taken more seriously than richardson _meta_end_dot_

 they see him as an expert to lead on any issue _meta_end_dot_

 gas prices and alternative fuels _meta_end_question_

 he was a clinton energy secretary _meta_end_dot_

 diplomacy to avoid these nasty wars _meta_end_question_

 he was a clinton un ambassador _meta_end_dot_

 the bold change ticket _meta_end_question_

 richardson is hispanic _meta_end_dot_

 for the insane base _meta_end_question_

 richardson campaign on get out of iraq now _meta_end_exclamation_

 and some dopey nyt reporter would love concocting a late night sessions at which obama and richardson talk shop in an intellectual discussion covering all that ails america _meta_end_dot_

 pejman yousefzadeh oh please god no _meta_end_dot_

 listening to richardson at a debate is a nightmare _meta_end_dot_

 diplomacy is his answer to any and all foreign policy problems and while i don t have an issue with diplomacy per se i do have an issue with someone repeating the word diplomacy over and over and over and over and over during the space of a debate answer to the point where you want to stab yourself in the eardrum with a dull pencil just to relieve the agonizing pain _meta_end_dot_

 bill richardson is the political equivalent of smooth light jazz at a dentist s office _meta_end_dot_

 he actually makes you look forward to the drill and the root canal _meta_end_dot_

 dan mclaughlin ae i could see him taking bradley _meta_end_dot_

 bradley is a longtime favorite of good government liberals though he did no more to clean up his own state s party than obama has and he has the requisite air of gravitas _meta_end_dot_

 he s also like nunn impressively dull but i think dull would do obama some good actually _meta_end_dot_

 some people mistake dull for serious and obama brings enough flair for two candidates nobody minded that bradley was dull when he played with clyde frazier _meta_end_dot_

 both would be very cheney esque picks _meta_end_dot_

 then again the guy who is running the vetting process presided over the selection of geraldine ferraro in _meta_number_ref_ and john edwards in _meta_number_ref_ neither of whom was at all that kind of candidate _meta_end_dot_

 dan mclaughlin pejman one of the really telling anecdotes from the democratic debates is this as told by richardson mark kilmer i can hear the violins _meta_end_dot_

 and pej what you said about richardson is also true to a less developed extent of obama himself _meta_end_dot_

 you ll hear the mesmerizable masses murmur obama richardson hope change _meta_end_dot_

 obama richardson hope change and it s off to the airports to buy the flowers they re selling _meta_end_dot_

 pejman yousefzadeh the difference is that obama to his credit has access to a thesaurus and can occassionally change his word choice _meta_end_dot_

 with richardson _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 not so much _meta_end_dot_

 brad smith strickland would be a strong candidate a guy who might actually help carry a state vital to mccain s chances and who would soothe the waters roiled by rev _meta_end_dot_

 wright _meta_end_dot_

 but if we re going to speculate let s get beyond the obvious candidates whose names are circulating _meta_end_dot_

 i could see obama going to an old democratic sage a lloyd bentsen type _meta_end_dot_

 experience military background more conservative geographic balance _meta_end_dot_

 if he wants a legacy he can replace this pick with a younger man for his second term in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 so who fits the bill _meta_end_question_

 the name that comes to my mind is former georgia senator and chairman of the armed services committee sam nunn who is _meta_number_ref_ years old _meta_end_dot_

 he meets every item listed above he s not too old but he s old enough no one seeking to succeed obama clinton _meta_end_question_

 others will be threatened and old enough to bow out gracefully in _meta_number_ref_ years if obama wants to annoint a younger successor _meta_end_dot_

 plus he s been out of the limelight so he hasn t had to take votes on the war etc that could clash with the campaign s positions unlike lieberman in _meta_number_ref_ who had to do lots of embarrassing gyrations to make his past statements jibe with the position of his running mate in the _meta_number_ref_ campaign _meta_end_dot_

 and he d help carry georgia a state obama thinks he can at least put in play and maybe win _meta_end_dot_

 brad smith i see dan beat me to nunn by a couple minutes _meta_end_exclamation_

 darn _meta_end_exclamation_

 academic elephant i still don t see why more people don t think bradley is better than nunn _meta_end_dot_

 dan mclaughlin well nunn s a southern moderate and was considered a bipartisan kind of guy _meta_end_dot_

 bradley s a northeastern egghead liberal which is a demographic that obama already has locked up _meta_end_dot_

 nobody s mentioned al gore yet but he seems like the one guy who would genuinely not want the job again _meta_end_dot_

 academic elephant bradley could help in pa and the egghead part could help shore up obama s lightweight problem _meta_end_dot_

 i think he s a more attractive choice than nunn _meta_end_dot_

 thomas crown _meta_number_ref_ he s from new jersey _meta_end_dot_

 in many parts of this great land that eliminates him on its face _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ he s kinda ugly _meta_end_dot_

 dan mclaughlin ae true _meta_end_dot_

 and i could easily imagine photo ops of them shooting a few hoops _meta_end_dot_

 they d definitely be the tallest ticket in history _meta_end_dot_

 mark kilmer but isn t nunn too old school for the hopechange bit _meta_end_question_

 a return to the politics of yesterday doesn t work for the obama campaign _meta_end_dot_

 thomas crown al gore is praying for a fight that goes to the convention so he can be a man the man for the hour _meta_end_dot_

 academic elephant i agree with that _meta_end_dot_

 dan mclaughlin if obama thinks he s going to carry georgia either _meta_number_ref_ he s out of his mind or _meta_number_ref_ he knows something that we don t that will render any and all decisions about this election pointless _meta_end_dot_

 academic elephant is that a state where barr might make a difference _meta_end_question_

 thomas crown doubtful _meta_end_dot_

 academic elephant well if barr polls at _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ in ga would nunn make it competitive if obama takes _meta_percent_ref_ of african american voters _meta_end_question_

 thomas crown barr won t poll at _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ and i believe black turnout would roughly have to increase by half again _meta_end_dot_

 dan mclaughlin we re off topic here but basically i think barr will only be trouble in some of the narrowly divided western states like nv nm where _meta_number_ref_ _meta_percent_ref_ of the vote could tip the outcome _meta_end_dot_

 i know thomas likes to remind us that the western states are not the libertarian utopias sometimes portrayed by the people who lay claim to half of goldwater s legacy but there are a few percentage points of people there who have strong libertarian leanings at least some of whom are potential republican voters in a _meta_number_ref_ candidate race _meta_end_dot_

 getting back on topic i don t think either candidate should worry much about barr in selecting a running mate _meta_end_dot_

 thomas crown i agree this isn t about worry about third party candidates because nothing either major candidate will do change that dynamic _meta_end_dot_

 pejman yousefzadeh now that chuck hagel is retiring and likely ending all association with the republican party as a consequence he could be a potential maverick pick _meta_end_dot_

 dan mclaughlin hagel will get considered but he s basically voted as a down the line social conservative _meta_end_dot_

 that s not going to keep him in contention for long _meta_end_dot_

 brad smith bradley is clearly better than none _meta_end_dot_

 bradley smith brad smith another out of nowhere senior statesman with military experience would be former senator oklahoma governor and president of u _meta_end_dot_

 of oklahoma david boren who is under age _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 boren endorsed obama a month or so ago _meta_end_dot_

 he s avoided divisive votes in recent years being out of dc but voted against the first gulf war in _meta_number_ref_ which might satisfy the hard left _meta_end_dot_

 california yankee obama should pick hillary _meta_end_dot_

 there would be a great love fest and unification among the democrats _meta_end_dot_

 i do not see that happening _meta_end_dot_

 but i wouldn t have predicted reagan to pick bush either _meta_end_dot_

 i agree with dan about the necessity of selecting someone with executive experience _meta_end_dot_

 i would not suggest a female _meta_end_dot_

 the folk in flyover country can only be pushed so far _meta_end_dot_

 obama needs someone who is white or richardson like hispanic and male _meta_end_dot_

 i would rule out richardson for a number of reason _meta_end_dot_

 he was irrelevant as a candidate _meta_end_dot_

 then there are the security issues when he was secretary of energy _meta_end_dot_

 i see obama left with the likes of general zinni governor corzine bob kerrey and mayor bloomberg _meta_end_dot_

 dan mclaughlin richardson is indeed something of a scandal typhoid mary _meta_end_dot_

 he was the un ambassador when we set up oil for food too _meta_end_dot_

 but i still think he beats many of the alternatives _meta_end_dot_

 kerrey s too supportive of the iraq war and too critical of his own party on the same score _meta_end_dot_

 corzine would be a terrible pick for a host of reasons _meta_end_dot_

 mark i obama s biggest weaknesses are foreign policy military experience and executive experience generally _meta_end_dot_

 but if the obama campaign were asked to pick one i d bet they pick executive experience as the most in need of shoring up _meta_end_dot_

 i believe that obama believes in himself so much that he won t think his relative lack of foreign policy gravitas is all that bad _meta_end_dot_

 he probably just think that if he does the opposite of bush he ll do just fine _meta_end_dot_

 for that reason i don t think he goes with the military guy _meta_end_dot_

 jim webb gens _meta_end_dot_

 jim jones anthony zinni and wes clark will be considered but probably passed over _meta_end_dot_

 webb would be the best of the bunch but another first term senator as the vp might get him laughed off the stage _meta_end_dot_

 so that leaves obama with the governors _meta_end_dot_

 i don t see him picking a woman as a running mate _meta_end_dot_

 i think the list of acceptable women is one name long and obama would be making a mistake along the lines of hannibal crossing the alps on elephants by picking her _meta_end_dot_

 so sebelius and napolitano are out _meta_end_dot_

 rendell is long on experience and gravitas but short on loyalty _meta_end_dot_

 he is too closely connected with the clintons to be trusted _meta_end_dot_

 plus he campaigned very actively for her in pa where obama lost by _meta_number_ref_ points _meta_end_dot_

 strickland is also a hillary guy albeit to a lesser degree _meta_end_dot_

 if he goes governor i think he looks to moderate democrats from swing or southern states _meta_end_dot_

 bredersen from tennessee could get a look but if i were advising obama i d look closley at joe manchin from west virginia _meta_end_dot_

 manchin was officially neutral in the west virginia primary when he could have very easily sided with clinton and the _meta_percent_ref_ of the state s democrarts who voted for her _meta_end_dot_

 he has cut taxes and is viewed as fiscally responsible which won t mean much to obama but would help with outreach to rural working class democrats _meta_end_dot_

 manchin has a decent national image being hailed for his swift and genuinely caring response to the miner s tragedy in the state some years ago _meta_end_dot_

 if obama decides to go the elder statesman route i wouldn t overlook former sen _meta_end_dot_

 george mitchell _meta_end_dot_

 he is known as an international peace maker for the northern ireland deal and may lend some credibility to obama s desire to negotiate with iran and syria _meta_end_dot_

 plus as chairman of disney he has executive experience and a foot in the business world the better to soothe wall street executives nervous about an obama led economy _meta_end_dot_

 dan mclaughlin manchin s one of the people i forgot to mention if obama s picking a governor he d be one of the better choices _meta_end_dot_

 adam c ditto dan _meta_end_dot_

 i thought i was forgetting a rust belt gov and that was it _meta_end_dot_

 i think the new ky governor is too new _meta_end_dot_

 but machin wv strickland oh rendell pa bredesen tn easley nc and kaine va cover a wide region _meta_end_dot_

 moe lane first off let me repeat assuming _meta_end_dot_

 second i think that we re going about this all wrong we re all a _meta_end_dot_

 policy wonks and b _meta_end_dot_

 not particularly impressed by barack obama _meta_end_dot_

 his supporters on the other hand are either not policy wonks or are else allowing themselves to be overwhelmed by the idea of barack obama and he s playing to them not to us _meta_end_dot_

 so nobody will be picked in order to balance the ticket from their point of view and happily obama s there s no need for balance _meta_end_dot_

 what they ll want expect instead is somebody that they can perceive as being almost as cool as barack obama _meta_end_dot_

 if i had to guess i d guess mark warner _meta_end_dot_

 sure it d mean quitting the senate race but the obama s whim must be deemed more important than the needs of virginia _meta_end_dot_

 moe lane jim webb would make an excellent eagleton to obama s mcgovern _meta_end_dot_

 only with more barely repressed rage _meta_end_dot_

 plus i will highly enjoy watching people ask webb about this article _meta_end_dot_

 over and over and over again _meta_end_dot_

 at every opportunity _meta_end_dot_

 until he punches somebody _meta_end_dot_

 dan mclaughlin well moe i don t think warner would accept or the rest of the dnc would sit for punting a senate race that right now looks like a lock gilmore may be a comparatively weak candidate but he s strong enough that if you replaced warner with a totally unknown generic d gilmore would suddenly have better than an even shot _meta_end_dot_

 also i ll say it right here if obama loses the general election i regard warner as the favorite to be the democrats potus nominee in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 obama s people may be impressed with obama but they can read polls and newspapers and listen to mccain too _meta_end_dot_

 they know two things _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 obama s having trouble nailing down some segments of the democratic voting public _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 mccain is hammering him on foreign policy experience _meta_end_dot_

 i think they will focus on those as the areas obama needs to shore up _meta_end_dot_

 which brings us back to the fact that webb s the one guy who best fits the profile on both counts and why i expect him to end up as the top name on the list _meta_end_dot_

 thomas crown i really really think we re making too much of the double senator pick _meta_end_dot_

 political junkies and folks who pay attention might be unnerved by having too little executive experience morons won t be _meta_end_dot_

 vice presidents are chosen a to succeed the president in case of tragedy b to placate some wing or other of the party and or c to reassure the morons _meta_end_dot_

 kitten has a problem with a particular subgroup of morons arguably some heavily overlapping groups of morons _meta_end_dot_

 kitten reasonably expects not to have a heart attack during his first term _meta_end_dot_

 kitten only needs to pacify one wing of his party _meta_end_dot_

 this leaves two choices cankles or webb _meta_end_dot_

 he d be certifiably insane to bring the clintons into the white house with him without a legion of food tasters and neutering bill so cankles is probably out _meta_end_dot_

 that leaves born fidgeting _meta_end_dot_

 mark kilmer but moe obama has to play to the people who aren t already entranced by hopechangehope _meta_end_dot_

 he has to make hopechangehope appealable to the more serious bread and butter electorate and i still think richardson fits that bill _meta_end_dot_

 and to hear the media recite the qualities richardson is as hip as obama _meta_end_dot_

 bill richardson is uomo universale and you don t get much kewler than that _meta_end_dot_

 that s what i d be pushing if i were a member of team obama _meta_end_dot_

 then i d kill myself _meta_end_dot_

 moe lane well we are assuming that obama s the nominee dan _meta_end_dot_

 at this point that sort of implies that the dnc is going to sit still for giving him the nod why not keep going and have them cater to his every whim _meta_end_question_

 as for webb _meta_end_dot_

 he says things _meta_end_dot_

 things that his new party can only ignore because he s just a senator from a red state _meta_end_dot_

 moe lane mark that s the glorious thing about this election and why the nomination hasn t been settled yet you and i may think that he has to but his supporters don t _meta_end_dot_

 we ve all seen how they get when the slightest imperfection is suggested about their idol and that s a double edged sword _meta_end_dot_

 it s like that sacred king anthropological nonsense only for real _meta_end_dot_

 anyway they look at richardson they see an overweight old guy with a beard _meta_end_dot_

 not obama worthy _meta_end_dot_

 neil stevens moe isn t there also the strange new respect effect too since he s an ex reagan guy _meta_end_question_

 moe lane actually no _meta_end_dot_

 he skipped the most important part of snr the repudiation of heresy and the affirmation of orthodoxy _meta_end_dot_

 webb hasn t repented in public yet _meta_end_dot_

 let s make him _meta_end_dot_

 francis cianfrocca blackhedd not sure if anyone has said this yet but the only logical choice for obama is hillary clinton _meta_end_dot_

 there i said it _meta_end_dot_

 yes her negatives are high but it does give obama a chance to claw back some of the support he would otherwise have trouble with in swing states _meta_end_dot_

 yes it s possible to overestimate the support she can bring that he can t the old they re democrats they won t vote for mccain argument but even if we re not talking about much it will still matter _meta_end_dot_

 the objection to this is that obama and clinton hate each other _meta_end_dot_

 sure but so what _meta_end_question_

 this is all about getting elected president of the united states _meta_end_dot_

 it s totally underrating both obama and the democrat party to assume that he won t ever go near her again or that the dems won t successfully heal all of their division that we ve enjoyed watching these last few months _meta_end_dot_

 if all obama has to do is grit and grin for the cameras while holding clinton s hand for the next few months he can do it _meta_end_dot_

 hell if he can t then he s too thin skinned to be a school board president much less potus _meta_end_dot_

 thomas crown well like i said you d be right except for the fact that he d have to be freaking nuts to take her on board without making sure she can t de medici him _meta_end_dot_

 dan mclaughlin yes blackhedd but here it does matter that obama thinks the stars are well aligned for him and he can choose from a position of relative strength _meta_end_dot_

 he believes he s a strong candidate in a good environment thus he will seek to patch weak spots not do drastic surgery and will do so with an eye to governing after the election _meta_end_dot_

 that means the last thing he wants is a vp he can t trust who has an independent base of support in the party knows the place better than he does and has a limitless capacity for generating distraction and scandal _meta_end_dot_

 if hillary s the vp obama will still be awake when the phone rings at _meta_number_ref_am because he ll be afraid to put the lights out _meta_end_dot_

 francis cianfrocca blackhedd interesting and cogent analysis _meta_end_dot_

 this is certainly an argument that obama might go for _meta_end_dot_

 but i m imaging how i d react in his place _meta_end_dot_

 there are tremendous near term political benefits becoming the great uniter etc to putting hillary on the ticket _meta_end_dot_

 and if it were me i d listen to all the arguments and counterarguments around the table and then i d probably say to myself i can handle this b_meta_beep_ref_ no problem i probably wouldn t say to myself a man in my position has to know his limitations and she s one of em thomas crown i agree with that last part _meta_end_dot_

 to be president you have to think you re more or less invincible _meta_end_dot_

 charles bird _meta_end_dot_

 nominating richardson or hillary will not help obama there s already a minority on the ticket _meta_end_dot_

 like with mccain and my endorsement of jindal obama needs someone who will balance the slate _meta_end_dot_

 he needs someone who is white and male _meta_end_dot_

 his running mate should not be hard left because obama already has that ideological sector covered _meta_end_dot_

 the vp choice should also have experience gray hair and a good military background and is more centrist _meta_end_dot_

 the best candidate the one who fills all those categories is wesley clark _meta_end_dot_

 the general wasn t that good of a presidential candidate but all he really has to do this time around is neutralize mccain s advantage on military and foreign policy military _meta_end_dot_

 jim webb would be a good choice too and may just be obama s guy _meta_end_dot_

 a surprise wild card pick would be chuck hagel _meta_end_dot_

 he s already retiring from the senate and most republicans and pretty much all conservatives don t like him anyway _meta_end_dot_

 the pick would be conditioned on hagel leaving the gop and going either independent or democrat _meta_end_dot_
