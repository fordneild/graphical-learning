  before the new hampshire primary when it looked like hillary clinton was going down to a second consecutive humiliating defeat at the hands of barack obama the rumors of her campaign s impending doom were thick _meta_end_dot_

 i speculated at the time that the rumors were a campaign rouse designed to rally clinton s supporters to save her candidacy _meta_end_dot_

 and then the waterworks came _meta_end_dot_

 i believed upon seeing the video that clinton s tears were crocodilian and i still do _meta_end_dot_

 when she won the primary unexpectedly i like many others thought it confirmed that the rumors were just a well played part of the low expectations game _meta_end_dot_

 but on second thought i have become convinced that clinton s crying game is evidence that her campaign really was in turmoil and that a big loss that night could have finished her off _meta_end_dot_

 read on by pulling out the handkerchief clinton had to know that she was reaching for a gun with only one bullet _meta_end_dot_

 how could she possibly get that emotional again even if it was genuine without it hurting her _meta_end_question_

 either she would be labeled as unable to handle the pressures of the presidency or her initial fakery would be seen for what it really was _meta_end_dot_

 furthermore although she has had a history in the democratic primary of accusing the old boys network of ganging up on her she really must have wanted to save that crying jag for the general election _meta_end_dot_

 if it s a one shot deal best to use it when it can do the most good _meta_end_dot_

 the fact that the damsel in distress card came out early shows that clinton s campaign thought it was in big trouble _meta_end_dot_

 so she went all in _meta_end_dot_

 and the rest is history _meta_end_dot_

 yes i believe that we came tantalizingly close to a primary campaign without the clintons _meta_end_dot_

 some have commented that it would be in the eventual republican nominee s favor for clinton and obama to have a long bloody primary battle _meta_end_dot_

 such a spectacle would result in a weakened opponent for the general election _meta_end_dot_

 i am sympathetic to that school thought _meta_end_dot_

 but it is based on the belief that obama the beneficiary of an early clinton collapse is unbeatable by the republican unless significantly weakened by the democrat _meta_end_dot_

 i disagree _meta_end_dot_

 i don t believe that republicans should be afraid of running against the big bad obama _meta_end_dot_

 the senator from h o p e is making his campaign on a promise to deliver a different kind of politics _meta_end_dot_

 he is selling himself as an agent of change unique among all of the politicians in the country _meta_end_dot_

 but what are his positions _meta_end_question_

 he wants to raise taxes talk to america s enemies expand the role of the federal government nationalize healthcare and so on _meta_end_dot_

 in other words he s just a liberal _meta_end_dot_

 nothing more _meta_end_dot_

 that he is not generally recognized as such is a testimony to how little people actually know about him _meta_end_dot_

 but in the course of an election campaign when he is contrasted against a lone republican especially a conservative republican they will find out _meta_end_dot_

 it s easy to forget since the primary campaign has been going on for close to a year that there are still ten months to go until the presidential election _meta_end_dot_

 obama will have to get through all that time without doing anything typical for a politician and a democratic one at that _meta_end_dot_

 he will have to make policy proposals that will be debated _meta_end_dot_

 he will have to react to events _meta_end_dot_

 he will have to vote _meta_end_dot_

 every time he takes a position issues a reaction or votes in the senate in the way a standard issue liberal would a little more of the bloom will come off the rose _meta_end_dot_

 obama is a teenager in political terms _meta_end_dot_

 he thinks he has a fresh answer for everything _meta_end_dot_

 but he will find out right along with america that the new politics is not really new _meta_end_dot_

 it s just better packaged _meta_end_dot_

 clinton is the seven headed hydra of presidential politics _meta_end_dot_

 if she can be slain in the democratic primary so be it _meta_end_dot_

 bring on the obama _meta_end_dot_

 republicans should not be afraid _meta_end_dot_
