  kevin drum s idea of a rebate in the face of difficult economic times is as follows it is far better to have no stimulus at all _meta_end_dot_

 the curious thing about drum s post is that he seems to ignore the very lesson he excerpts concerning the _meta_number_ref_ recession _meta_end_dot_

 here is that lesson _meta_end_dot_

 read on _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 so if we really want to stimulate the economy we need a permanent tax cut _meta_end_dot_

 drum turns up his nose at the idea but the phenomenon of the laffer curve is very real indeed and we have plenty of room to cut taxes _meta_end_dot_

 no we shouldn t cut them to zero because there comes a point at the end of the curve beyond which tax cuts will negatively effect revenue collection _meta_end_dot_

 but it is possible for us to cut taxes significantly before reaching that point _meta_end_dot_

 more importantly it is possible to reform the tax system and create a flat one that will truly be progressive drop tax rates on individuals and broaden the base at the same time so that revenue collection increases _meta_end_dot_

 just follow the link here and you will see how it works _meta_end_dot_

 and again i ask the question that has been bugging me for many years now can we finally get tax reform please _meta_end_question_

 there is no reason after all to continue with an inferior tax system _meta_end_dot_
