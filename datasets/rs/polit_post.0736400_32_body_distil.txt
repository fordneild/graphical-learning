  by now we should all be familiar with roger simon s stunt _meta_end_dot_

 fred thompson failing to bow down before roger simon saw a campaign stop totally mischaracterized by roger simon _meta_end_dot_

 what was a light hearted moment turned into a moment of campaign ineptitude in roger simon s eyes _meta_end_dot_

 luckily the moment was caught on film and the world could see for itself that roger simon was full of crap _meta_end_dot_

 it s happened again _meta_end_dot_

 jill lawrence no doubt feeling slighted by the campaign for not getting a one on one with fdt had her revenge in usa today _meta_end_dot_

 she writes after putting that up she had to correct herself when bill theobald told her she got it wrong _meta_end_dot_

 by the way the thompson camp was kind enough to send me a transcript so we can see for ourselves just how inaccurate jill lawrence s third hand reporting was _meta_end_dot_

 the question was do you want to be president based on the question and just the first ten words you d think jill lawrence could have gotten it right
