  don t you read your own magazine _meta_end_question_

 jay is out blaming right wing bloggers and rush limbaugh for starting the michelle obama whitey tape rumor _meta_end_dot_

 of course as jay s own co worker karen tumulty noted in the same magazine that jay writes for it was hillary clinton supporters who started the rumor _meta_end_dot_

 not us _meta_end_dot_

 i like jay carney _meta_end_dot_

 i think he s a good reporter _meta_end_dot_

 the title is humorous and based on a saturday night live skit _meta_end_dot_

 but jay is definitely ignorant in this matter _meta_end_dot_
