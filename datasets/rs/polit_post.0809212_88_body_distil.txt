  as much as i hate to subject you all to this here s a piece of seriously complex federal reserve news _meta_end_dot_

 i ll explain it as best i can however _meta_end_dot_

 the bottom line appears to be it s good news _meta_end_dot_

 you ve certainly heard that the bernanke fed have been doing unprecendented aggressive and creative things in their attempts to stabilize financial markets _meta_end_dot_

 to mitigate the effects of a us recession is an entirely different problem and not the current priority one of the things the fed did was to set up a term securities lending facility or tslf _meta_end_dot_

 what the heck is that _meta_end_question_

 it s a weekly auction to be held every thursday for the next six months _meta_end_dot_

 the fed will offer liquid risk free treasury securities from its inventory in return for specific kinds of risk bearing securities notably mortgage backed securities _meta_end_dot_

 they just held the first one on march _meta_number_ref_ and although the results are not unambiguous the auction does seem to have had a material positive impact on the money markets _meta_end_dot_

 keep reading _meta_end_dot_

 here s a little more clarity on exactly what the tslf is auctioning and to whom they re auctioning _meta_number_ref_ day loans of specific treasury securities with a wide range of maturities _meta_end_dot_

 any primary dealer may participate including certain investment banks and broker dealers _meta_end_dot_

 it s not restricted to commercial banks _meta_end_dot_

 institutions that successfully bid on the fed s treasury securities must pay interest on the principal value of the borrowed securities that rate is what they bid on and they must supply collateral in the form of other securities deemed acceptable to the fed _meta_end_dot_

 in effect the fed are doing two important things at the same time _meta_end_dot_

 first they re putting more us treasury securities out into the market in a sterilized fashion that does not reduce the overall money supply _meta_end_dot_

 this is going to relieve the preternaturally high demand for treasury debt that has been choking the money markets for weeks now _meta_end_dot_

 how did that work _meta_end_question_

 pretty darned well _meta_end_dot_

 before the auction the three month treasury bill was trading to yield something like _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ percent _meta_end_dot_

 that s not a typo _meta_end_dot_

 the handle literally was zero _meta_end_dot_

 and about two weeks ago the so called specials rate for overnight repo collateralized by the three month bill was a negative number _meta_end_dot_

 people would literally pay you to borrow their cash so long as you provided the three month t bill as collateral _meta_end_dot_

 to my knowledge this has never happened before with the short bill although it did happen in the late summer of _meta_number_ref_ with the _meta_number_ref_ year treasury note _meta_end_dot_

 after the tslf auction last thursday the overnight repo rate jumped back up to a much healthier looking number a little below _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 in normal times it runs just a few basis points below the fed funds rate which is _meta_number_ref_ _meta_percent_ref_ this morning far above target this suggests that the extraordinary shortage of short dated treasury debt has now abated _meta_end_dot_

 the fed s second key objective and it s a very interesting one was to reduce the oversupply in the secondary market for mortgage backed securities _meta_end_dot_

 this also worked out pretty darned well _meta_end_dot_

 the fed accepted bids for treasury debt with a par amount of _meta_dollor_ref_ billion _meta_end_dot_

 that means they took out of the market mortgage backed securities amounting to at least that much in face value probably a lot more actually _meta_end_dot_

 the sudden decrease in the supply of mortgage backed securities raised their prices sharply which reduced their interest yield _meta_end_dot_

 you may have noticed that retail mortgage rates suddenly plunged late last week _meta_end_dot_

 now you know why _meta_end_dot_

 combine this activity by the fed with the _meta_dollor_ref_ billion they lent to buy up mortgage backed securities from bear stearns and an exceptionally interesting picture emerges _meta_end_dot_

 the federal reserve has embarked on a policy to put a floor under the market for mortgage loans _meta_end_dot_

 many people have recently expressed fear that the housing market would not be able to clear at current prices unless it shed a great deal of the leverage being used to fund mortgage lending _meta_end_dot_

 because prices of mortgage backed securities are falling holders of these securities have been facing margin calls which forces them to sell even more _meta_end_dot_

 that produces the strange and perverse effect that demand falls as prices fall _meta_end_dot_

 in such an unusual situation the fear is that there is no equilibrium point between supply and demand unless you drop the entire housing market to far lower levels commensurate with the willingness of market participants to hold mortgage debt without leverage _meta_end_dot_

 and that would wipe out a good chunk of the economy _meta_end_dot_

 but by removing some of the over supply in the secondary mortgage market the fed appears to have managed to shift the supply curve to the left where it may again intersect the abnormally leftward sloping demand curve _meta_end_dot_

 this makes it at least theoretically possible for the market to equilibrate at nearly current levels _meta_end_dot_

 that means the fed may have found a magic bullet to cure the long credit crisis _meta_end_dot_

 it s too early to tell if this will be the result _meta_end_dot_

 but the early indications are quite hopeful _meta_end_dot_

 what s the downside of all this _meta_end_question_

 simply this since the fed is now effectively nationalizing market risk it potentially exposes itself to monetary losses _meta_end_dot_

 this is most certainly uncharted territory for the fed which for decades has stuck to the policy of not intervening in markets except as a lender of last resort _meta_end_dot_

 but on balance i think it s more likely that the fed will make a profit on these activities _meta_end_dot_

 that s because the mortgage backed securities they re buying have been beaten down far below what is likely their long term stable value _meta_end_dot_

 you can certainly argue that the fed are wading hip deep in a pool they shouldn t have gotten into in the first place _meta_end_dot_

 but i think that if they can pull this off and stabilize the financial system and by extension the economy they ll have earned our undying gratitude _meta_end_dot_

 i d much rather the fed get into this than congress which can t make decisions based on cold hearted financial calculations _meta_end_dot_

 congress works by making some people happy at the expense of others _meta_end_dot_

 when you re spreading pain around that approach only increases the total amount of pain _meta_end_dot_
