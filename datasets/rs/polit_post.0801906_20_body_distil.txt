  the most important chart in this story is found at the bottom and points out that the ideology of american voters is closer to that of the republican candidates than it is to that of the democrats _meta_end_dot_

 while the democratic team may currently have more momentum going for it than does the republican team momentum can certainly shift and irrespective of the issue of momentum it seems clear that there is no great ideological realignment taking place that would favor liberals over conservatives _meta_end_dot_

 food for thought for all those who believe that republicans are dead and doomed as a party _meta_end_dot_

 food for thought as well in advance of the fall election whatever the conventional wisdom might say no one should think that this election is in the bag for the democrats _meta_end_dot_
