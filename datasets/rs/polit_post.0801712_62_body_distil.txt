  before the election season began in earnest the conventional wisdom was that this election would illustrate that the republican base really doesn t like mormons _meta_end_dot_

 instead it turns out that this election has taught us that the republican vanguard really doesn t like southern evangelicals _meta_end_dot_

 for proof of this fact one only need examine the hysterical reaction to mike huckabee s comments on the constitution some republican commentators have become so unglued by the prospect of a presidential candidate daring to suggest that he allows his faith in god and the principles which in his own mind flow from that faith to inform his political desires that they have pronounced that mike huckabee is a man to be feared every bit as much as a man who thinks that the taliban should be given the keys to this country _meta_end_dot_

 this is of course rubbish and the criticism thus expressed says much more about mike huckabee s critics than the above quoted unfortunate turn of phrase says about huckabee _meta_end_dot_

 read on _meta_end_dot_

 now i will first say this mike huckabee could have conveyed his point in a much more artful fashion _meta_end_dot_

 huckabee is clearly the best communicator in the gop field but he still doesn t seem to have learned that in the course of a presidential campaign a whole different level of scrutiny will be applied to every statement you make _meta_end_dot_

 further not all of your opponents and certainly not the press will give you the courtesy of placing your words in context when they use them to attack you _meta_end_dot_

 so i do wish that perhaps he would have illustrated his point in a way that was not so open to attack _meta_end_dot_

 and yet i feel compelled to defend the thrust of huckabee s point from attackers on the right who have suddenly become enamored of the rhetoric of the left at least as applied to huckabee _meta_end_dot_

 what huckabee has done very simply is dare to suggest that his religious principles inform his political views _meta_end_dot_

 further he has dared to suggest that the will of god is definite and is at least to some degree ascertainable by humans and that humans are to some degree capable of conforming themselves to the word of god _meta_end_dot_

 what sort of backward thinking rubes believe and think this way _meta_end_question_

 allow me to introduce mike huckabee s critics to a group known as evangelicals for future reference the vast majority of these people actually believe that the word of god is inspired and infallible and is to some degree subject to correct interpretation by individual christians _meta_end_dot_

 for further reference and i know this will be shocking to some of you these evangelicals believe that the word of god applies to all facets of their life that it is not merely binding when they are in a church building _meta_end_dot_

 this will be a struggle for some of you to accept but these evangelicals believe that the word of god should inform the way that you conduct yourself at your work when you are socializing when you are at home and yes when you are voting _meta_end_dot_

 i have smelling salts handy if anyone needs them at this point _meta_end_dot_

 of course in reality this principle only bothers aspects of the gop elite commetariat when it s southern evangelicals who are allowing a larger value system to shape their view of politics _meta_end_dot_

 would rick moran object so strenuously if a presidential candidate said i support the right to homosexual marriage because i am a humanist _meta_end_question_

 almost certainly he would not _meta_end_dot_

 would andy mccarthy liken a person who said i oppose socialized medicine because of my belief in the power and efficiency of the free market to the taliban _meta_end_question_

 i dare say the answer to that question is no _meta_end_dot_

 the reality of course is that everyone s political preferences are informed by a larger worldview and certain sectors of the gop commentariat are only bothered in this case because one of those jesus freaks has gotten loose onto the national stage and he s embarrassing their cosmopolitan sensibilities _meta_end_dot_

 these people have inexplicably embraced john kerry s justly mocked explanation for his position on abortion i e that because he believed as a religious matter that abortion was wrong he could therefore not believe that as a political matter _meta_end_dot_

 this ridiculous explanation was laughed at by many of the same people who are now mocking mike huckabee and it has never occurred to the mockers that that they have embraced the major premise in kerry s argument _meta_end_dot_

 at least insofar as it is applied to southern evangelicals _meta_end_dot_

 this notion that it is impermissible for a man s faith to dictate his voting or political conscience would have been laughed at by virtually all if not all of the prominent conservative thinkers of the last two centuries _meta_end_dot_

 were burke chesterton or kirk alive today no serious conservative would dare to suggest to them that a man must leave god behind when entering public life for fear of being justly rhetorically beaten about the head by any of these men _meta_end_dot_

 and yet we are confidently assured that all responsible conservatives will condemn mike huckabee s rhetoric and his vision of the world _meta_end_dot_

 here is a free tip for all who are of this mind secularism plus free market capitalism is not the sine non qua of conservatism _meta_end_dot_

 they may in your view be good things but please don t hijack an extant philosophy and distort it to suit the needs of the moment _meta_end_dot_

 that these commentators would attempt to do this with a philosophy known as conservatism is especially ironic _meta_end_dot_

 i would further say to those who have shown such disdain for mike huckabee and what he believes in that the jesus freaks are not just going to go away because you make fun of them _meta_end_dot_

 i mean they might leave the party in which case good luck cracking _meta_percent_ref_ in the next few elections but you ll find that sincere belief in evangelical christianity is a sturdy enough phenomenon to survive generations of your disdain _meta_end_dot_

 it so happens that there is a very significant overlap between what these evangelicals want to accomplish and what many free market secularists want to accomplish _meta_end_dot_

 certain free market secularists have apparently decided that the areas that do not overlap are dragging the party down and therefore the people who hold to them must be jettisoned in the theory i guess that eventually evangelical christianity will just go away or at least that evangelical christians will stop trying to live according to their beliefs _meta_end_dot_

 my hope is that this election if nothing else having introduced you to southern evangelicals will disabuse you of that notion _meta_end_dot_

 no one should be a stranger to over half the people in his own voting bloc _meta_end_dot_
