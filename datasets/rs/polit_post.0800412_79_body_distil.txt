  update apologies to my esteemed colleague soren dayton who is on the ground in new hampshire and posted that the press got this all wrong _meta_end_dot_

 when _meta_number_ref_ year old john mccain was asked whether he had the stamina to serve as president for eight years he responded by suggesting that if he is elected he might not seek reelection mccain s single term gambit is a better approach to the age issue than ronald reagan s _meta_number_ref_ promise to undergo testing for senility _meta_end_dot_
