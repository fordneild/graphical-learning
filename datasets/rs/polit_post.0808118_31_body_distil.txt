  note to those who are hyperventilating i m about _meta_percent_ref_ sure rush knows this is meant to be taken lightheartedly and with good humor _meta_end_dot_

 i appreciate so many of you rushing to defend him and condemn me for this post _meta_end_dot_

 now calm down _meta_end_dot_

 erick leaving church a short while ago following good friday services and contemplating the death and resurrection of christ our lord i nearly had an aneurysm getting in my car and turning on rush limbaugh _meta_end_dot_

 he was suggesting bobby jindal for vice president _meta_end_dot_

 shut your pie hole rush limbaugh _meta_end_dot_

 don t ever do that again _meta_end_dot_

 i am an elected city councilman in georgia _meta_end_dot_

 i have lived in georgia for nearly _meta_number_ref_ years _meta_end_dot_

 louisiana is my home _meta_end_dot_

 i believe in this great republic of ours there are no indispensable men perhaps save rush but he s testing that theory today but bobby jindal is a necessary man in louisiana at this time _meta_end_dot_

 louisiana too is going through a resurrection _meta_end_dot_

 bobby has successfully had two special sessions of the legislature to reform taxes in the state and reform ethics in the state _meta_end_dot_

 being there two weeks ago there is a new pulse in the state _meta_end_dot_

 the state has a heartbeat again _meta_end_dot_

 people again believe the state is salvagable _meta_end_dot_

 rush limbaugh would have john mccain ruin that all by picking bobby as his veep _meta_end_dot_

 bobby can t be veep because louisiana needs bobby at this time _meta_end_dot_

 the state cannot spare him even for the good of the party or the good of the nation _meta_end_dot_

 besides i think bobby has improved odds of outright being president in four to eight years _meta_end_dot_

 the only saving grace of rush daring to suggest this is that it is rush suggesting it _meta_end_dot_

 surely mccain will discount the idea outright _meta_end_dot_

 rush we should get behind governor palin _meta_end_dot_

 she s conservative she s smart and she looks a whole heck of a lot better than bobby jindal or john mccain _meta_end_dot_

 oh and if she were to leave her post her state would not slide back into the gutter _meta_end_dot_

 so rush stop with pushing jindal _meta_end_dot_

 louisiana needs him too much right now _meta_end_dot_

 title changed because i fear gamecock might otherwise have a heart attack _meta_end_dot_
