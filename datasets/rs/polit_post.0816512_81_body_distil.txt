  if you haven t read anything by canadian journalist and author mark steyn your life is the poorer for it _meta_end_dot_

 he s marvelously witty and fun to read _meta_end_dot_

 he s also one of the loudest proponents of the view that western cultures particularly in europe are allowing themselves to be slowly extinguished through a refusal to confront islamization _meta_end_dot_

 steyn is a disciplined and careful reporter _meta_end_dot_

 everything he writes is backed up by research and reasoned argument _meta_end_dot_

 he doesn t commit libel _meta_end_dot_

 but that s not good enough in canada anymore _meta_end_dot_

 two years ago he published an article in maclean s which recapitulated themes from his book america alone _meta_end_dot_

 but it s against the law in british columbia to say things that muslims don t want to hear regardless of how objectively truthful well supported and reasonable they are _meta_end_dot_

 so steyn is now personally facing criminal jeopardy _meta_end_dot_

 but of course this is of no interest to america s arbiters of taste in the mainstream press _meta_end_dot_

 however they re extremely interested in another aspect of the story _meta_end_dot_

 keep reading see it s not just steyn himself who is on trial for violating the criminal law of british columbia _meta_end_dot_

 his co defendant is maclean s the prominent weekly magazine that published him _meta_end_dot_

 that s a big deal to the journalistic poobahs who believe their job is to tell you what to think and how to think it _meta_end_dot_

 why _meta_end_question_

 because it gets to one of their favorite subjects the first amendment _meta_end_dot_

 here s what the new york times has to say about the case _meta_end_dot_

 read it and see if you can figure out what they re trying to say _meta_end_dot_

 it s pretty interesting and not the reflexive pro muslim and anti free speech point of view you might expect them to take _meta_end_dot_

 instead the article is a disquisition on how america s approach to free speech rights differs from that of the rest of the world _meta_end_dot_

 it turns out that to borrow a phrase from mark steyn america really is alone when it comes to free expression _meta_end_dot_

 no other nation tolerates it as much as we do _meta_end_dot_

 and this is really why the times saw fit to engage the steyn macleans story _meta_end_dot_

 their question isn t why is british columbia prosecuting mark steyn for saying things that are objectively true rather they ask whether america s position on free speech is too broad and should be tightened to match the rest of the world _meta_end_dot_

 i ve been reading the new york times all my life _meta_end_dot_

 and i think that mainstream journalists the times foremost among them have always been hypocritical on the subject of the first amendment _meta_end_dot_

 all professional journalism by definition is objective and balanced _meta_end_dot_

 the way the times gets around this requirement is to present the view that they re biased in favor of in the first two thirds of each news story they write with the disfavored view presented at the end _meta_end_dot_

 try it with a selection of new york times stories chosen at random and see for yourself _meta_end_dot_

 the correct view is presented first in cool neutral sounding terms and supported by quotes from well respected authorities _meta_end_dot_

 the wrong view is then introduced with phrases like to be sure and of course some observers believe that and they always find the least sympathetic people to quote from in the last third of each article catholic priests middle aged white men serial killers republicans etc given that i read the times piece about mark steyn to be saying that the american approach to free expression jurisprudence really is better and shouldn t be changed because we allow journalists to write whatever they please regardless of how hateful it might be _meta_end_dot_

 of course they do have to square this up with another of their core principles moral relativism _meta_end_dot_

 in the final third of the story the times reporter allows that countries like germany and south africa have perfectly understandable speech suppression laws because of their history _meta_end_dot_

 so of course the fact that times reporters are able to write whatever they want without fear is merely a happy coincidence of our history and not anything more fundamental _meta_end_dot_

 i ll forgive you in case you re outraged that the times cavalierly puts mark steyn in the same category as the nazis and the apartheid ists _meta_end_dot_

 to them it s all just hate speech and the only question is whether it should be allowed all of this tells you what you need to know about the first amendment according to left wing orthodoxy it s there to make it possible for journalists to ply their trade as they please _meta_end_dot_
