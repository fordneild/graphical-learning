  john harris and jim vandehei are relatively well known for their book in which they claim as i wrote in my review that politics has devolved into a freak show that makes political coverage seem like a constant scandal watch this phenomenon is largely blamed on websites like the drudge report and the blogosphere _meta_end_dot_

 to be sure this made harris and vandehei somewhat biased in favor of the old media but one would expect that their condemnation of the freak show would have led them to criticize as many other had the tone and tenor of the most recent debate between barack obama and hillary clinton since so many of the questions focused on the political and the personal rather than on policy _meta_end_dot_

 but they do not _meta_end_dot_

 quite the contrary they argue that the debate was quite balanced and that to the extent the obama faction is complaining it is largely because the senator did badly and for perhaps the first time was directly and seriously challenged by questions that were the consequence of his front runner status read on _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 in making their argument harris and vandehei offer the following startling and no doubt accurate admission the following also caught my eye he was facing similar questions he too would be bombarded by negative media coverage _meta_end_dot_

 the following passage may be of some cheer to our friends on the other side of the partisan divide since it appears to show that they too know how to work the refs but let there be no doubt that the refs are being worked i am not blaming the obama campaign for having worked to cultivate a relationship with the media that leaves the latter gasping and cooing over the senator s talent and political appeal _meta_end_dot_

 that is the job of the obama campaign and both the senator and his staff have done their job well _meta_end_dot_

 but let there be no doubt that much of the media is in the tank for barack obama _meta_end_dot_

 the campaign may have intended this outcome and kudos to them for having had the moxie and industry to pull it off _meta_end_dot_

 the rest of us however have a duty to demand that the media pull back from its position of adulation and subject barack obama to the same kind of scrutiny that hillary clinton and john mccain get _meta_end_dot_

 no one asks the media to go out of their way to harm obama as a sort of make up for past behavior _meta_end_dot_

 but that past behavior should not be denied _meta_end_dot_

 nor should it be allowed to continue _meta_end_dot_
