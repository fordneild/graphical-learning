 you ve got to love irony _meta_end_dot_

 assuming you know what it is _meta_end_dot_

 i know we ve got a few friends who like to visit the site these days who get big words like that confused with others _meta_end_dot_

 mean turns to median irony turns to iconic which turns to iconoclastic _meta_end_dot_

 whoa _meta_end_exclamation_

 but chin up at least you re in good company _meta_end_dot_

 irony for the definitionally challenged is an outcome of events contrary to what was or might have been expected exhibit a house democrats suddenly admitting their massive mbt surcharge should be repealed _meta_end_dot_

 the detroit news reports this morning on the growing number of michigan businesses being crushed under massive increases in their tax burden _meta_end_dot_

 the michigan chamber of commerce reports that many small and medium sized businesses are seeing doubling tripling and even a quadrupling of their previous tax liability _meta_end_dot_

 the republican controlled senate last week passed a _meta_dollor_ref_ million tax relief package to ease the burden but the democrat controlled house of representatives is yet to take any action _meta_end_dot_

 according to the news read on _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 two weeks ago the house republicans introduced plans to repeal the democrats _meta_percent_ref_ michigan business tax hike _meta_end_dot_

 that d represent _meta_dollor_ref_ million in savings for michigan taxpayers _meta_end_dot_

 they also offered nearly _meta_dollor_ref_ million in common sense spending cuts and savings that would protect schools the social safety net our seniors and look after those least able to look after themselves _meta_end_dot_

 representative bieda didn t have much to say about that sort of common sense plan two weeks ago _meta_end_dot_

 sounds like maybe he s started hearing from business owners and job providers in his district _meta_end_question_

 just a guess _meta_end_dot_

 but whatever the reason if he s serious i d like to welcome him to the good side _meta_end_dot_

 hope he s willing to pull up a chair and stay for a while _meta_end_dot_

 what with that d after his name he might actually stand a chance of getting some legislation taken up on the house floor provided tobocman doesn t make a parliamentary move first _meta_end_dot_

 exhibit b the centerpiece of the michigan dems environmental package now being sued by a kennedy for mercury pollution _meta_end_exclamation_

 all we ve heard since the governor s state of the state speech _meta_end_dot_

 the one where she literally had to ask the packed dem controlled chamber for applause _meta_end_dot_

 is about alternative energy s potential to clean up the environment _meta_end_dot_

 it s the answer _meta_end_dot_

 oil is so dirty and _meta_end_dot_

 dirty _meta_end_dot_

 but by giving consumers energy and dte a new monopoly they can not only kill competition literally and raise rates which they ll pass along in the form of giant campaign contributions to lefties no doubt unfettered they ll create new fancy clean forms of energy that will close the ozone layer increase the o_meta_number_ref_ content in the atmosphere eradicate emphysema and create an environment where unicorns can battle back from the brink of extinction _meta_end_dot_

 oh and they can dump a bunch of mercury into the detroit river and kill a bunch of canadians too _meta_end_dot_

 the associated press reports that a group of environmentalists led by a famous american liberal are targeting detroit edison part of dte because they re not quite as environmentally conscious as jennifer granholm would like us to believe _meta_end_dot_

 this might really provide us an opportunity to see politics making strange bed fellows _meta_end_dot_

 who do the libs in michigan side with _meta_end_question_

 their hero bearing the kennedy name fighting for children and a clean environment against evil american corporate polluters the four worst things in the history of the world were you to poll them by the way or their democrat governor fighting to give those corporate polluters a monopoly so they have more money and less accountability while demanding zero actual results _meta_end_question_

 a decade ago that d have been a no brainer _meta_end_dot_

 but after five plus years having to defend the undefendable granholm cherry record _meta_end_dot_

 i m not so sure any more _meta_end_dot_

 my guess is the left here in state will turn a blind eye to the poisoning of the river and the corporate pollution _meta_end_dot_

 who cares if a bunch of canadian kids wind up dead anyways right _meta_end_question_

 see _meta_end_question_

 irony _meta_end_dot_

 exhibit c detroit free press headline this morning proclaiming jeremiah wright urges racial understanding there s really nothing i can say that jeremy can t say better _meta_end_dot_

 can you feel the racial understanding _meta_end_question_

 i know i can _meta_end_dot_
