  citizens voice subverted by agenda driven interests there is a nifty think tank down in bozeman called perc the property and environment resource center _meta_end_dot_

 they re pretty low key but they do put out some good stuff _meta_end_dot_

 mostly they are focused on market based solutions to environmental problems _meta_end_dot_

 i ve linked to their stuff at least on one occasion and here s what happens _meta_end_dot_

 the sinestra descends en masse not to discuss the issues but to remind you that the organization gets its money from drum roll please corporations _meta_end_dot_

 that to them is enough _meta_end_dot_

 it s money from corporations and therefore tainted _meta_end_dot_

 if the advocacy is in their favor well then that s ok since the ends justify the means _meta_end_dot_

 to be sure donations to these groups are clearly intended to affect policy _meta_end_dot_

 no matter which side of a debate you re on advocacy groups are putting money into _meta_number_ref_c_meta_number_ref_ s _meta_number_ref_c_meta_number_ref_ s and all kinds of groups for the sole purpose of changing policy _meta_end_dot_

 if a legislator wants to use a document in the process from either side i m _meta_percent_ref_ fine with that _meta_end_dot_

 that s the way it should work _meta_end_dot_

 just getting that out of the way _meta_end_dot_

 read on _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 you may have missed this story in the montana press recently _meta_end_dot_

 the headline was gop disputes warming findings here are the first _meta_number_ref_ grafs wow a story about the gop _meta_end_question_

 you d think so _meta_end_dot_

 most of the quotes are from gop legislators and those quotes are framed in such a way that they appear entirely unreasonable while quotes from the other side appear to be calm and reasoned _meta_end_dot_

 anyone who has been interviewed for a news story knows how much of your tale ends up on the cutting room floor but that s how you frame stories _meta_end_dot_

 sad to say it s pretty typical of what we see in the montana press especially those who cover our state government in that certain items are taken uncritically while the other side is simply made fun of _meta_end_dot_

 but wait _meta_end_dot_

 what was that about the climate change advisory council _meta_end_question_

 let s look into that _meta_end_dot_

 fair enough _meta_end_dot_

 these panels are appointed all the time _meta_end_dot_

 the appointment was duly noted by the montana press along with the members _meta_end_dot_

 from the gazette on first blush it seems like a reasonable list _meta_end_dot_

 gary perry and sue dickenson are identified by party but others are not _meta_end_dot_

 let s look at the list a little bit and fill in some blanks _meta_end_dot_

 the only folks remaining are republican legislator gary perry _meta_number_ref_ power industry guys one of which appears to be the only actual scientist in the whole group william walks along and a science teacher _meta_end_dot_

 wow _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ folks who by their affiliations and or professions appear to be predisposed to the notion that climate change is caused by man _meta_end_dot_

 then there are _meta_number_ref_ management level guys from the power companies who are most likely to avoid rocking the boat at all one republican legislator one actual scientist and a geophysicist at that and the remainder seem likely to be chosen from the community at large _meta_end_dot_

 when i was active in a couple of service groups and we held nominations and elections for officers we used to all make the sound of a train whistle since we knew the deck was stacked and we were going to be railroaded _meta_end_dot_

 well let me just say chugga chugga chugga chugga whoo whoo in the days ahead we re going to be looking at the meeting process that the ccac used and what role ccs played in the process while also examining how it was covered in the media _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_url_ref_ cross posted to my long running state blog mtpolitics net _meta_end_dot_
