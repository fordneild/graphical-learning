  and a bigot to boot _meta_end_dot_

 apparently but i am against barack obama for president and hillary clinton too and it s not because of their black ness or female ness it s because they are wrong wrong for america and wrong for the people they claim to fight for _meta_end_dot_

 in my intentionally inflammatory rant about frank rich i decided to throw a few race cards on parallel with those of mr _meta_end_dot_

 rich s level of ridiculousness when he suggested that the gop had been reduced to nothing more than the grand old white party i had a problem with the idea that a white man who came of age in washington dc before desegregation and busing and had moved to harvard right before the mlk assassination and the ensuing riots and carnage wrought by all colors on our fair nation s capitol back in april _meta_number_ref_ would presume to suggest that being a republican was somehow by nuance implication and innuendo the same as being a white supremacist male or some such nonsense _meta_end_dot_

 worse he presumes some expertise in the area of black white relations from the vantage point of a political party instead of one who lived with or grew up with black people or any other minority for that matter _meta_end_dot_

 yeah i ticked quite a few people off when i spoke even a little bit about any positives that might be gleaned from the pre civil war south and whoo boy did i fire up some folks _meta_end_dot_

 good _meta_end_dot_

 let s consider the democrats regarding several pertinent areas of their elitist supremacy and minority exploitation m kay _meta_end_question_

 i m feeling the need for a little more hate to be thrown my way _meta_end_dot_

 more below the fold _meta_end_dot_

 first can someone help me understand how the democrats have behaved with regard to american blacks since the civil rights act became law _meta_end_question_

 all they seem interested in doing is laying out giveaways and entitlements and freebies funded by wealth redistribution from other american constituencies which in and of itself breeds resentment and further draws lines of distinction amongst the populous expecting a vote to put keep them in power in exchange while paying no attention to the longer term implications of such routinely failed policies _meta_end_dot_

 the democrats want us to believe we have in the gop taken something away from black america or that we have something we want to keep them from having _meta_end_dot_

 what is it that the democrats have done to help blacks and other minorities _meta_end_question_

 affirmative action _meta_end_question_

 quotas _meta_end_question_

 welfare _meta_end_question_

 food stamps _meta_end_question_

 head start _meta_end_question_

 earned income credits _meta_end_question_

 the united negro college fund _meta_end_question_

 black pride days _meta_end_question_

 a federal holiday to commemorate mlk s birthday _meta_end_question_

 coining the pc buzzword african american these are the things that have brought black america up from the days of jim crow to a color blind and an equal and rich and diverse society where everyone hugs each other on the streets in some kind of cultural utopia _meta_end_question_

 or have these things actually made it harder for everyone white green yellow or purple to come together as a people and a nation _meta_end_question_

 how have the democrats strengthened the american family more specifically the minority american family _meta_end_question_

 abortion on demand _meta_end_question_

 fighting to keep religion out of public purview _meta_end_question_

 standing back or doing nothing to slow or reverse the growth in the numbers of unmarried births _meta_end_question_

 of fatherless children _meta_end_question_

 of teen pregnancy _meta_end_question_

 none of these things have resolved the problems america s minorities face and struggle with every day yet an obama or clinton presidency promises to give you more of them _meta_end_dot_

 what s that old saying about the definition of insanity _meta_end_question_

 there s just something perverse about how the democrats claim to help black america treating a race of proud and righteous people as if they were children on an allowance that need more of it in order to do less with it while watching statistic after statistic prove in many cases that the plight of blacks in this country is as bad now or worse in certain regions of the country most specifically the inner city than it ever was _meta_end_dot_

 given how much pleasure the democrats take in claiming to be the party of america s minorities isn t it only fair then to assign them the blame for the status of blacks today and hispanics and others _meta_end_question_

 yet they continue to get elected on empty promises of more giveaways and more tilting of the scales of balance favorably toward minorities only to abandon them the day after the election s _meta_end_dot_

 talk about a bill of goods _meta_end_dot_

 in a country that has moved beyond slavery where we are diligently trying to raise our children to be color blind where we really do try to teach them to look at those who appear different and judge them as mlk himself once said not by the color of their skin but by the content of their character are the democrats living up to king s vision for the black community by continuing to hold them out as some thing they all fight over _meta_end_question_

 doesn t this actually keep them separate from the rest of america _meta_end_question_

 or at least considered somehow different from the rest of it _meta_end_question_

 is marginalizing a constituency really the best way to help them truly become equal it is far more frequently that i hear democrats talking about blacks what they need how they re suffering how much they feel their pain what unique problems their race allegedly brings to their ability to just be americans and i can t help but wonder who really has the problems with diversity here _meta_end_dot_

 republicans and theoretically conservatives believe in personal responsibility and accountability _meta_end_dot_

 we believe in doing for ourselves helping our friends and loving nurturing protecting and providing for our families supporting and being actively engaged in our community and living as if there was something greater than ourselves at play in the grand scheme of this thing called life _meta_end_dot_

 we believe in hard work in reaping the benefits of our efforts in keeping what is ours to do with as we deem appropriate and we don t want government any more involved in our daily lives than is absolutely necessary for the good of the republic as we once proudly called it _meta_end_dot_

 of the many black hispanic asian indian pakistani iraqi iranian and other fill in the blank americans i have grown up with lived near or worked for or had work for me in business life i can t remember any who didn t share these ideals and attitudes about what it means to be an american _meta_end_dot_

 are any of these principles being preached by the democrats who would be president _meta_end_question_

 no _meta_end_dot_

 to obama s credit he is not running for first black president perhaps because hillary s husband already claims that title but make no mistake the dnc operatives are running him that way and they mean to use obama s race everywhere and anywhere they can if it will muster a few more votes to put him over the top _meta_end_dot_

 inside that little playbook are orders to destroy any who might disagree with obama _meta_end_dot_

 they will pile drive anyone that might dare challenge this obasm with the you hate blacks meme and it will work _meta_end_dot_

 it has thus far at least and will become the standard fare when if he clears to the general _meta_end_dot_

 but what if we disagree because he s flat out wrong on the issues _meta_end_question_

 won t matter we ll be accused of being racists of trying to prevent destiny and an america long overdue for a black man in the white house _meta_end_dot_

 but what if he s wrong _meta_end_question_

 won t matter and you won t be allowed to say as much _meta_end_dot_

 well i m going to the rest of you are on your own _meta_end_dot_

 barack obama s policy proposals are not only bad for america they re bad for black america and hispanic america and every other corner of america _meta_end_dot_

 we need all americans to wean themselves from the government teat long enough to see how much more they can accomplish for themselves if only government would get the hell out of the way _meta_end_dot_

 we need all americans to listen to both of obama s sentences not just the first one that says government is broken and we need change but the second one which is i m going to make government fix itself what it has already broken and we need to remind folks of this every day every hour every minute _meta_end_dot_

 a government that he has been a part of is broken yet he wants everyone to believe only he and his cronies can fix it _meta_end_dot_

 they are not capable of fixing it themselves because they have completely lost any sense of what the heck they were supposed to be doing with it in the first place _meta_end_dot_

 but as i said these ideas appear to define me as a knuckle dragging neo confederate racist pig so what do i know _meta_end_question_
