  has something gone wrong with the world _meta_end_question_

 i ask that seriously _meta_end_dot_

 have we forgotten the past thirty years _meta_end_question_

 we have barack obama out quoting karl marx to rich trust funders in san francisco _meta_end_dot_

 we have hillary pushing her nationalization schemes _meta_end_dot_

 and now we have this robert greenwald guy and his documentary company brave new films pushing a war on capitalism in a rather unfunny video advocating tax increases on tax day _meta_end_dot_

 you can see it here if you really want to _meta_end_dot_

 this greenwald guy wants to be the next michael moore without any humor _meta_end_dot_

 and his prescription is the same old nonsense moore peddles raise taxes on businesses _meta_end_dot_

 to hell with us heading into a recession _meta_end_dot_

 read on for why this matters _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 in this cartoon greenwald goes after private equity you know where a business goes to a private bank to get money instead of the government _meta_end_dot_

 so instead of closing the business and firing everyone the business is able to keep people employed and turn the company around _meta_end_dot_

 to greenwald this is a bad thing _meta_end_dot_

 oh and the company gets to pay capital gains taxes at a reduced rate so the company has an incentive to actually make money _meta_end_dot_

 this too is bad according to greenwald _meta_end_dot_

 why _meta_end_question_

 because some dude is laid off _meta_end_dot_

 while that s not a good thing it sure would be a lot worse if the whole company closed down and everyone got laid out _meta_end_dot_

 but greenwald dodges that point _meta_end_dot_

 he is too wrapped up in equating employers with bad that he ignores the fact that employers through private equity build businesses that create jobs that employ the same people he wants to have hate employers _meta_end_dot_

 one last point on this greenwald s evil character is named henry kravis _meta_end_dot_

 mr _meta_end_dot_

 kravis is greedy sneaky cigar smoking and presumably with that last name jewish _meta_end_dot_

 is it any wonder then that white supremacists have latched on to other of greenwald s videos _meta_end_question_

 to my knowledge mr _meta_end_dot_

 greenwald has not denounced these hate groups using greenwald s own character to push the same message as greenwald but directly blaming the jews _meta_end_dot_

 i d like to think mr _meta_end_dot_

 greenwald picking this character was unintentional but the hate sites out there seem to think it all too fitting _meta_end_dot_

 hopefully mr _meta_end_dot_

 greenwald will be more careful in the future _meta_end_dot_

 now you all have probably read this wondering what the heck i m going on about _meta_end_dot_

 you ve probably never even heard of this guy _meta_end_dot_

 well with the help of the mainstream media mr _meta_end_dot_

 greenwald is trying to establish himself as a more credible honest version of michael moore _meta_end_dot_

 his film company is on the left but tries to play it straight _meta_end_dot_

 it is extremely important that we pay attention and don t let this guy get a pass _meta_end_dot_

 he is a left wing polemicist and his video clearly demonstrates he knows nothing about how the free market works but he is nonetheless out to undermine it _meta_end_dot_

 that just plays into the hands of an all too willing media out to help us forget the teaching points on tax cuts and free markets over the last thirty years _meta_end_dot_
