 i posted earlier today about obama kowtowing to the chinese _meta_end_dot_

 he doesn t want to say anything mean to the chinese because in his words it s very hard to tell your banker that he s wrong but in _meta_number_ref_ obama took the chinese to task over all their faulty products the lead paint in toys the poisoned drugs and food etc _meta_end_dot_

 why the change _meta_end_question_

 moe lane offers a clue _meta_end_dot_

 if he s willing to throw his grandmother and staffers under the bus so easily i guess he s also willing to throw the country under the bus when it s convenient _meta_end_dot_

 how delightful _meta_end_dot_

 the problem of course is that he s already signaled to our enemies in the middle east that his policy as president will be to tuck tail and run home from fights _meta_end_dot_

 he exacerbates it by doing the same to china _meta_end_dot_

 i await his capitulation to hugh chavez next _meta_end_dot_
