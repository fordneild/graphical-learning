 this article is not yet available on line so it is re printed here with permission by jerry augustus science bi quarterly staff writer camden scientists have been studying the nature and spread of obama bedazzlement syndrome or obs and so far have achieved little to no progress in understanding its cause or treatment _meta_end_dot_

 we re stuck said a frustrated dr _meta_end_dot_

 geraldine s _meta_end_dot_

 gomez lead researcher at the personality cult institute _meta_end_dot_

 we had hoped for a breakthrough by now but scientific results have proved elusive _meta_end_dot_

 we re in a quagmire so to speak sbq has had the good fortune of landing an exclusive interview with dr _meta_end_dot_

 gomez to explain the obs phenomenon and her experiences to date _meta_end_dot_

 also on hand is pci scientist dr _meta_end_dot_

 shelby feldstein who has been studying hillary clinton _meta_end_dot_

 more below the fold _meta_end_dot_

 sbq first off what is obs _meta_end_question_

 gomez well jerry obs is not too dissimilar from bush derangement syndrome which was originally diagnosed by dr _meta_end_dot_

 charles krauthammer who found that bds can afflict otherwise reasonable liberals _meta_end_dot_

 at the sound of president bush s voice or upon seeing him on video emotions overwhelm the left side of the brain causing fits of anger paranoia and conspiracy theorizing _meta_end_dot_

 like with bds obs suspends rational thought but the difference is in the emotional response which is mostly a feeling of warm gushiness _meta_end_dot_

 sbq is obs dangerous _meta_end_question_

 gomez so far less so than bds mainly because scientific studies have shown that prolonged anger and bitterness have resulted in health problems downstream _meta_end_dot_

 we have seen no evidence that feelings of warm gushiness affects human health one way or the other but our primary concern with obs sufferers is that its victims have proven exceedingly difficult to reason with which in turn adversely affects many forms of political discourse _meta_end_dot_

 sbq what are the symptons and are people able to identify obs when they see it _meta_end_question_

 gomez there are a range of symptoms jerry and if you see two or more flags in a person then he or she may have very well been infected _meta_end_dot_

 if a friend is a little more glassy eyed than usual and increasingly uses terms like hope and change while at the same time offers no additional specifics you may be witnessing the early onset of the syndrome _meta_end_dot_

 there are also physical manifestations _meta_end_dot_

 if you or a friend swoons more frequently or feels a thrill going up the leg like chris matthews that would be a more pronounced case _meta_end_dot_

 fainting in the presence of obama is a telltale sign of advanced obs _meta_end_dot_

 sbq does obs cross party lines _meta_end_question_

 gomez in some cases unfortunately yes _meta_end_dot_

 we re not sure yet how it happened but former romney supporter douglas kmiec came down with an acute case _meta_end_dot_

 we could tell right away that dr _meta_end_dot_

 kmiec has obs because of his near complete incoherence _meta_end_dot_

 sbq why study this syndrome _meta_end_question_

 gomez well for one thing this type of study is right in our wheelhouse at pci _meta_end_dot_

 fourteen months ago rolling stone writer ben wallace wells put it best _meta_end_dot_

 quote for another thing on a scientific level we are fascinated that a liberal freshman senator with scant experience and an even scantier record has garnered so much success to date _meta_end_dot_

 it looks like he ll be the democratic nominee assuming senator clinton doesn t find a way to lawyer herself to victory _meta_end_dot_

 sbq what scientific procedures have you undertaken _meta_end_question_

 gomez we ve been trying to measure brainwave activity using auditory and optical inputs _meta_end_dot_

 when obama s soundwaves and video images hit aural and optic receptors we gauge the responses by measuring alpha and beta waves in the brain _meta_end_dot_

 our best hypothesis is this because of issue underload there are significant intellectual gaps in the receptors that must be filled in some way _meta_end_dot_

 the average politician who issues standard liberal boilerplate and utters vague generalities about coming together and yes we can will cause boredom in voters and the average person will be distracted with other more useful thoughts _meta_end_dot_

 but what we ve found with obama is that he fills these gaps with well we don t have a good scientific name for it so we just call it mojo _meta_end_dot_

 to use a sci fi analogy like with anakin skywalker and his midichlorian counts obama has off the charts mojo _meta_end_dot_

 sbq now because of these effects has your team of researchers had to take any precautions _meta_end_question_

 gomez yes we have _meta_end_dot_

 in the early weeks of our analysis after prolonged obama exposure we ve had a lab assistant or two wander off and start talking about hope and change _meta_end_dot_

 one even said if supporting obama is wrong i don t wanna be right but after a couple of hours of detox they were fine but since then we ve asked our researchers to wear protective anti propaganda suits _meta_end_dot_

 sbq detox _meta_end_question_

 gomez yes _meta_end_dot_

 we put our infected personnel in a hermetically sealed room one at a time _meta_end_dot_

 just a chair table and small notebook of obama s record and white papers on his issues _meta_end_dot_

 after a couple of hours of intense study the obs is gone followed by feelings of mild embarrassment and comments such as what was i thinking now remember our staff are trained professionals _meta_end_dot_

 we tried this technique with our test subjects but they fell asleep before the obs effects could be fully countered _meta_end_dot_

 hence our frustration _meta_end_dot_

 sbq how long does obs last _meta_end_question_

 gomez a good question _meta_end_dot_

 we initially thought several months similar in length to the infatuation stage of a romantic relationship _meta_end_dot_

 but it looks like obs could last for a full election cycle _meta_end_dot_

 but we re not giving up _meta_end_dot_

 last december we added a half dozen phd s to more intensely study the syndrome _meta_end_dot_

 sbq sounds expensive _meta_end_dot_

 gomez it is but we ve received some generous grant money which will last us through november _meta_end_dot_

 sbq who are the benefactors _meta_end_question_

 gomez we have two main ones _meta_end_dot_

 one of them is ickes wolfson lehane llc whoever they are _meta_end_dot_

 the other is the national association of infomercial producers _meta_end_dot_

 one of their representatives said they d like to put that obama lightning in a bottle and sell it on a _meta_number_ref_ minute program _meta_end_dot_

 we later spoke with talked to kip vanderzan spokesman for the naip _meta_end_dot_

 instead of loud sweaters and cleavage to get our viewers attention said mr _meta_end_dot_

 vanderzan if our presenters had some of obama s mojo i m sure we could sell exercise equipment and anti aging creams like hotcakes sbq so what s been your biggest roadblock _meta_end_question_

 gomez i think dr _meta_end_dot_

 feldstein could better answer that question _meta_end_dot_

 sbq what would like to say dr _meta_end_dot_

 feldstein _meta_end_question_

 feldstein nothing really _meta_end_dot_

 sbq c mon man _meta_end_dot_

 i ve got yankees tickets _meta_end_dot_

 feldstein well ok _meta_end_dot_

 we ve been applying similar scientific techniques as dr _meta_end_dot_

 gomez but our test subjects are listening to and watching hillary s speeches and comments _meta_end_dot_

 the effects are rather the opposite of obama s especially when they hear the cackle or when she tries to talk like a black person _meta_end_dot_

 when you add the untruths and dirty tactics most of our subjects feel emotions of repulsion _meta_end_dot_

 we call it the hillary impolitical vector or hiv _meta_end_dot_

 sbq why is this infringing on the obama research _meta_end_question_

 gomez because way too many of our subjects are testing hiv positive _meta_end_dot_

 we don t know how much obs is influenced by hiv or not which is really muddying up our ability to advance our study _meta_end_dot_

 sbq thank you for time and good luck _meta_end_dot_

 gomez and feldstein you re welcome _meta_end_dot_
