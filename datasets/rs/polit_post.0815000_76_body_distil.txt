  moe notes obama may now go to iraq after a bunch of right wing bloggers piled on his refusal to go with mccain _meta_end_dot_

 obama backtracked on his aushwitz story after a bunch of right wing bloggers piled on _meta_end_dot_

 obama caved on his unilateral meetings after a bunch of right wing bloggers piled on _meta_end_dot_

 obama caved on reverend wright after a bunch of right wing bloggers piled on _meta_end_dot_

 obama caved on _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 well the list goes on and on _meta_end_dot_

 every time right wing bloggers pile on an obama statement or misstatement obama caves _meta_end_dot_

 if he ll kowtow to us right wing bloggers and cave so easily how much faster will he cave to folks like chavez and ahmadinejad _meta_end_question_

 update as epu points out and i paraphrase if obama will cave so quickly to those he is ideologically opposed to he ll probably fold at the speed of light when it comes to his kindred spirits around the world _meta_end_dot_
