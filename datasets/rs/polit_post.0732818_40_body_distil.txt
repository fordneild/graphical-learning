  it is disappointing to see that john howard and the liberal party have lost the australian elections _meta_end_dot_

 but by all accounts they can hold their heads up high as having served the australian people well and having bequeathed a sound and prosperous society to incoming prime minister kevin rudd _meta_end_dot_

 iraq as an issue has gotten a lot of attention but it is important to note that the vast majority of attention paid by the australian electorate was to domestic and economic issues _meta_end_dot_

 australian troops will be withdrawn from iraq but by all accounts the nature of american australian relations will not change _meta_end_dot_

 it will be interesting to see if rudd has been able to fully reform the australian lbor party and whether liberal treasurer peter costello who will likely inherit howard s mantle as the leader of the liberals can revive the party s fortunes in time for the next election _meta_end_dot_

 in the meantime a thank you from ed morrissey _meta_end_dot_

 it is not given without reason _meta_end_dot_
