  over the last half of this century the united states supreme court has frequently elected to decide what the law should be rather than what the law actually is _meta_end_dot_

 through routine applications of substantive due process and an expansive reading of the commerce clause the court has elected to form the contours of american law from the bench rather than deferring to congress and the states _meta_end_dot_

 while the supreme court must review legislation through the lens of constitutionality the role of our courts is to say what the law is not what it should be _meta_end_dot_

 if the court feels that a piece of legislation does not pass constitutional muster then it may require the originating legislative body to make a second effort to comply or render the law inoperable _meta_end_dot_

 the court should not make determinations of policy or social issues that are properly left to the consideration of publicly elected officials _meta_end_dot_

 when the court strays from strictly interpreting the law and the constitution we are left with abortions at a whim brutal murderers receiving reduced penalties and private property being seized by state and local governments for private commercial gain _meta_end_dot_

 earlier this week senator john mccain pledged that his judicial appointments would have a proven record of excellence in the law and a proven commitment to judicial restraint as we approach the coming election we must have leaders that are dedicated to upholding the rule of law and finding judicial nominees that are able to exercise the kind of restraint that senator mccain promotes _meta_end_dot_

 senator mccain recognizes that the real and desired activism in our country is democratic rather than judicial _meta_end_dot_

 as senator mccain mentioned real activists seek to make their case democratically to win hearts minds and majorities to their cause americans have a duty to be involved in the political process to make their opinions heard by their elected officials and to vote for candidates that reflect their values _meta_end_dot_

 if our next president nominates activist judges to force an agenda that could not otherwise garner the approval of the people he will betray the trust and silence the voice of the very people who put him in office _meta_end_dot_
