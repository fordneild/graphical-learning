  i d say this was gay or lame but it would be an insult to those two groups from whom we often take their labels and use as pejoratives against such ludicrously inane and dumb things as your attention getting grab _meta_end_dot_

 you are suppose to be a credible candidate for office _meta_end_dot_

 credible candidates do not climb tall poles and beg for media attention _meta_end_dot_

 doing so admits that your campaign is getting no traction and the media is ignoring you _meta_end_dot_

 it also opens you up to having another candidate someone who is credible jump into the democratic primary and beat your butt off that pole and out of nomination _meta_end_dot_

 dale come down _meta_end_dot_

 i know you want high name identification so you can beat snuggles _meta_end_dot_

 but when people talk high name id they don t mean _meta_number_ref_ feet in the air _meta_end_dot_

 they mean the number of voters who know who you are _meta_end_dot_

 i bet a good number of voters will now know who you are _meta_end_dot_

 and they re going to think you are nuts _meta_end_dot_

 come on down now dale _meta_end_dot_

 show s over _meta_end_dot_

 the circus is gone _meta_end_dot_

 we ve already got one clown in the democratic primary _meta_end_dot_

 you were suppose to be the sane one _meta_end_dot_

 oh and thanks for helping make this one heck of an easy re election race for saxby _meta_end_exclamation_
