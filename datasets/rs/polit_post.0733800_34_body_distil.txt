  the huckabee problem if you will perplexes me _meta_end_dot_

 not a day goes by lately without someone on the right criticizes him on economics _meta_end_dot_

 the new york times makes the case that he s not that bad but then i want someone economically conservative telling me huckabee isn t that bad _meta_end_dot_

 at the same time i can t really get that worked up about huckabee supporting a tax increase to fix roads in arkansas _meta_end_dot_

 the only people who could ever get worked up about that are people who have never been through arkansas _meta_end_dot_

 the stark contrast in arkansas pre huckabee and post huckabee is compelling _meta_end_dot_

 prior to huckabee you might drive down the interstate only to meet your end in a pot hole deeper than your hummer _meta_end_dot_

 after huckabee louisiana had to get a new governor who would make roads a priority so we could get back ahead of arkansas on something _meta_end_dot_

 but here s the thing i don t want to pile on mike huckabee _meta_end_dot_

 i tend to think he is an economic populist more than an economic conservative or liberal _meta_end_dot_

 he s like zell miller _meta_end_dot_

 again though not all these wingnuts bashing huckabee are committed to other candidates _meta_end_dot_

 i have tremendous respect to the club for growth and am a member _meta_end_dot_

 i do however think that huckbee at this time just might be more in tune with the american people than most of the gop _meta_end_dot_

 read on _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 the guy is a real outsider _meta_end_dot_

 his campaign is held together with string from last month s rib roast and bubble gum scraped off the side of the road _meta_end_dot_

 and he s kicking romney s butt all over iowa _meta_end_dot_

 voters are tired of the status quo in both parties and huckabee for all his faults is definitely not part of the status quo _meta_end_dot_

 i give mike huckabee real credit for what he has pulled off particularly in the face of just about every prominent conservative pundit i can think of save rush limbaugh beating the hell out of him for his ethics his temper his economics his populism etc _meta_end_dot_

 dude is winning _meta_end_dot_

 let s just accept it _meta_end_dot_

 and screaming about his economic plan isn t really hurting him with evangelicals right now who are more interested in saving the pro life cause from rudy than in salvaging a coherent conservative economic policy _meta_end_dot_

 here s the thing though huck _meta_end_dot_

 you ve been nothing but kind to me despite rumors of your foul temper _meta_end_dot_

 i consider several of your supporters and staffers good friends _meta_end_dot_

 if you want me to believe you are more than a gerson ger son n _meta_end_dot_

 a republican who likes to spend other people s money to feel good about himself in the name of social justice you are going to need to make the case _meta_end_dot_

 robert novak john fund the wall street journal editorial board the club for growth etc etc etc _meta_end_dot_

 right now beg to differ with you _meta_end_dot_

 and you can t muddy them up in my eyes _meta_end_dot_

 but you can tell all of us what your fiscal policy would look like heck come blog about it here _meta_end_dot_

 we re happy to have you governor _meta_end_dot_

 but regardless of where you go you need to start speaking _meta_end_dot_

 romney is doing a come to jesus meeting on his faith to shore up support with evangelicals _meta_end_dot_

 you best do the same with fiscal cons because most of us have known the club for growth a lot longer than we ve known you _meta_end_dot_

 and we trust them _meta_end_dot_

 don t say fair tax because we both know it ain t gonna pass in the next four years with the present make up of congress _meta_end_dot_
