  some of my favorites are making the headlines this week _meta_end_dot_

 the boys of will not be silenced and thank god because their message is one of greatness _meta_end_dot_

 there have several items regarding the national heroes tour as the iraq veterans travel across the country to present their message of enduring victory _meta_end_dot_

 yesterday the tour was to stop at forest lake high school in minnesota but the event was abruptly canceled by principal steve massey on grounds that it was prompted by concerns that the event was becoming political rather than educational and therefore was not suitable for a public school though executive director pete hegseth specifically agreed to keep it purely educational his promise was spit on when massey opted to succumb to the complaints of parents _meta_end_dot_

 they threatened to protest they complained _meta_end_dot_

 the people leading our public schools today are afraid it s no wonder kids today often reject the duty honor and character that comes with serving in the military _meta_end_dot_

 are we saying that patriotism and duty and honor have no place in our public schools hegseth was quoted as saying in the star tribune _meta_end_dot_

 read on _meta_end_dot_

 but vff is not easily deterred _meta_end_dot_

 they quickly relocated to a local american legion where dozens of students at forest lake high school were so upset that they skipped school to go see the speech according to a local news station _meta_end_dot_

 the station also reported that school officials repeatedly denied our requests for comment on the situation a story adequately entitled the stories they didn t want you to hear at forest lake high from the star tribune published today featuring the stories of these brave heroes despite the efforts of school administrators _meta_end_dot_

 hopefully a number of forest lake school administrators will also read some of these stories and reflect on those who do not bend despite enormous political pressure these men have served our country with honor and a public school s denial to allow them a platform to speak is despicable _meta_end_dot_

 well i guess it would be hard to stay unmoved by men who speak like this david bellavia s book house to house does a pretty good job of showing us what these men are made of too _meta_end_dot_
