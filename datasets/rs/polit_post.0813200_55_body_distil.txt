  tomorrow s washington post h t adam c will feature an op ed by emory university polisci professor alan abramowitz in these primary numbers warnings for the fall that seeks to turn logic and rationality on its head for the purposes of calling white america racist _meta_end_dot_

 voting patterns in indiana and north carolina show that resistance to a black candidate among some white democrats remains a serious threat to his chances in november abramowitz writes _meta_end_dot_

 obama continues to have particular difficulty with one segment of the democratic electorate white working class voters his explanation of this is long on unsubstantiated not rationally supportable conjecture and his conclusions lack anything remotely resembling evidence or facts _meta_end_dot_

 i suppose that s the price one pays for or the benefit of being a political scientist rather than having an academic specialty that prepares one to conduct research and draw conclusions from that research and analysis all a political scientist like abramowitz seems to feel the need to do is obtain numbers _meta_end_dot_

 his analysis and conclusions drawn from those numbers are all assumption with no explanation added as to how those conclusions were reached or why they should be accepted as correct _meta_end_dot_

 the backdoor assault on working class whites begins with abramowitz s declaration that despite a dearth of overtly racist beliefs which he concedes are much less prevalent among white americans of all classes today a more subtle form of prejudice which social scientists sometimes call symbolic racism is still out there especially among working class whites symbolic racism he explains means believing that african american poverty and other problems are largely the result of lack of ambition and effort rather than white racism and discrimination read on _meta_end_dot_

 certainly won t provoke that intended reaction _meta_end_dot_

 you see abramowitz doesn t bother to expand on that premise by explaining just how it is that the african american community s problems are all being caused by racist whites he just assumes and wants you to assume that it s true and to operate from that point of view as you read the rest of what he has to say _meta_end_dot_

 the rest of the column is dedicated to showing how widespread the attitude that the african american community s problems aren t to be solely chalked up to bigoted white crackers is you are expected to agree with him that that attitude and opinion is not only incorrect but abhorrent _meta_end_dot_

 some examples wow that s just unbelievable _meta_end_dot_

 fully _meta_number_ref_ percent of white voters clearly must weigh the same as a duck and be made of wood or whatever the racist version of that equation which is as scientific as abramowitz s argument is _meta_end_dot_

 anyway on top of those two hard hitting statistics and the absent logic and analysis explaining why holding those startling attitudes not only make one racist but are incorrect in the first place is nothing _meta_end_dot_

 the good science professor from emory university has apparently blown his wad on just those two underwhelming polling results _meta_end_dot_

 what were you expecting more _meta_end_question_

 hey i warned you if you didn t buy into the initial premise that the belief that african american poverty and other problems are not the result of white racism and discrimination makes you a symbolic racist then there was little or no point in reading the rest of the column as it would make little sense and utterly fail to provoke the outrage at and shame of those racist working class whites that abramowitz was do desperately hoping to achieve _meta_end_dot_

 oh yes the end of the piece _meta_end_dot_

 abramowitz concludes someone out there from the age of fifteen up who can serve as a sharper mind and present a clearer and more coherent argument than abramowitz _meta_end_dot_

 i have to say it s definitely a good thing that this wasn t submitted to rather then by the good professor as i feel confident saying that such assumption and such utter failure to back up both premise and argument would surely have earned the erstwhile student who produced such poor work a less than stellar grade _meta_end_dot_
