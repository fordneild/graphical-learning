  so the majority party in the senate believes that the best way to bring down gas prices is to impose a windfall profits tax on oil companies this despite the fact that the tax will eventually be passed on to consumers _meta_end_dot_

 it also wants to legislate against price gouging whatever that is _meta_end_dot_

 good thing this feel good do nothing bill went down to defeat _meta_end_dot_

 the reasons why that defeat was deserved can be found here _meta_end_dot_

 this is an old article but as it turns out it is still applicable _meta_end_dot_

 incidentally when will we have a windfall profits tax imposed on farmers _meta_end_question_

 it makes just as much sense as imposing such a tax on oil companies _meta_end_dot_
