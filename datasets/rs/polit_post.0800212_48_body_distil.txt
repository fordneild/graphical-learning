  promoted from diaries by mark i _meta_end_dot_

 following the example of many of my esteemed colleagues i thought i d ring in the new year by endorsing a republican candidate for president _meta_end_dot_

 my decision making process in this cycle has been a simple one as on my trump issue national security one candidate has the qualities i would like to see in a commander in chief _meta_end_dot_

 that candidate is rudy giuliani _meta_end_dot_

 read on _meta_end_dot_

 oh i know it s not fashionable to support the mayor these days _meta_end_dot_

 he took a beating in december over allegations since proven unfounded that he abused city funds to pursue his extra curricular love life _meta_end_dot_

 his failure to do a romney style flip flop on social issues has earned him the undying enmity of many on the right _meta_end_dot_

 his strategy and it is a strategy by the way of trying to reduce the utterly inequitable influence of iowa and new hampshire over the primary process and focus instead on states with more than seven electoral votes has been declared dead before arrival by those who are quite sure they know better _meta_end_dot_

 conventional wisdom wags its sagacious head and tells us he s done _meta_end_dot_

 but then again rudy s never been a conventional wisdom type _meta_end_dot_

 and neither have i _meta_end_dot_

 so here s why i ve chosen giuliani _meta_end_dot_

 he functions under inconceivable pressure _meta_end_dot_

 when the proverbial refuse hits the fan he is able to think beyond himself make decisions and exert that elusive quality of leadership that can pull a country through tragedy and loss _meta_end_dot_

 you don t need me to tell you this _meta_end_dot_

 we know it for a grim fact _meta_end_dot_

 we all remember where we were on _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 i think it s pretty safe to say we all remember giuliani _meta_end_dot_

 i cannot tell you how mitt romney john mccain fred thompson or mike huckabee would behave under comparable circumstances _meta_end_dot_

 i can guess and i expect some would do better than others _meta_end_dot_

 certainly senator mccain s biography demonstrates that the mayor does not have a monopoly on personal heroism _meta_end_dot_

 but do i think any of them would surpass giuliani in a major national security crisis _meta_end_question_

 i do not and i do think that s the ultimate test of a president _meta_end_dot_

 i suppose the question then becomes will anything hit the fan over the next _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ years _meta_end_question_

 my instincts say it s pretty likely and in this case i don t mind having a president who takes the war on terror or the terrorists war on us personally and seriously _meta_end_dot_

 but if it doesn t would that render a giuliani presidency irrelevant _meta_end_question_

 i don t think so _meta_end_dot_

 he demonstrates a sharp and lively grasp of national and international issues indeed some describe him as too interested in policy but i don t think that s possible _meta_end_dot_

 beyond his performance on _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ i believe a stint in the reagan justice department alongside the likes of john bolton and ted olson followed by an impressive performance in an impossible job as mayor of a failing city is a pretty good resume to be president _meta_end_dot_

 he has both federal and local experience _meta_end_dot_

 he s been part of a team and an executive _meta_end_dot_

 furthermore he is intelligent and articulate and brings a creative energy and confidence to all his endeavors that i think will serve him well as president _meta_end_dot_

 so how would mr _meta_end_dot_

 giuliani do in washington when bullets aren t flying _meta_end_question_

 given his record in new york i expect he would try to shake things up at state defense and justice _meta_end_dot_

 he would probably have a pretty tumultuous relationship with congress _meta_end_dot_

 but in all these cases i think that s a good thing _meta_end_dot_

 the status quo in any of those three major departments is simply unacceptable as is any candidate who thinks it is _meta_end_dot_

 and to my understanding the pitiable state in which we find our congress has deeper roots than the current cycle of political polarization _meta_end_dot_

 the broken appropriations and dysfunctional confirmation processes that are crippling our government s ability to do its job do not need a massage _meta_end_dot_

 they need an overhaul _meta_end_dot_

 i would like a chief executive who has an aggressive outside the box mindset and wants to change the system not work within it _meta_end_dot_

 give me the guy who took on the new york mob because i think that s the approach that s needed _meta_end_dot_

 in closing let me say i don t think i m harboring many illusions about the mayor _meta_end_dot_

 i do like him personally and i respect and admire him but i do not see him as some sort of political savior _meta_end_dot_

 the man is flawed _meta_end_dot_

 his personal life is sketchy at best _meta_end_dot_

 we differ on some serious issues notably abortion _meta_end_dot_

 yes i would prefer that he had a romney type family and a thompson style stance on social issues _meta_end_dot_

 but i trust his ability to select judges and i appreciate his consistency and candor on issues even when we disagree _meta_end_dot_

 for me these weaknesses do not come close to outweighing his strengths _meta_end_dot_

 and there you have it _meta_end_dot_

 be it fashionable or not because of his proven track record in crisis management his appetite for seemingly impossible intractable jobs his willingness to risk personal unpopularity to do what he believes to be right and his passionate belief in our country i consider rudy giuliani the best qualified candidate to confront the unknowable challenges that face us as a nation over the next four years _meta_end_dot_

 happy new year everyone _meta_end_exclamation_
