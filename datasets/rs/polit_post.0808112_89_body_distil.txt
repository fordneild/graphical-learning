  the never ending comedy that is bill richardson just got a little funnier today _meta_end_dot_

 just days after the press revealed that hillary clinton was in the white house while her husband was staining bill richardson s employee monica lewinsky s blue dress richardson came out today intent on slitting the throat of his political patrons _meta_end_dot_

 he s going to endorse barack obama _meta_end_dot_

 this is funny and interesting for several reasons _meta_end_dot_

 first you d think someone setting himself up as a latino leader would position himself at the top of the clinton food chain _meta_end_dot_

 after all latino voters are heavily favoring clinton over obama and richardson could make some leadership inroads there _meta_end_dot_

 second given the rate at which bill richardson likes to drop his pants for women not his wife you d think he d have a closer bond with bill clinton _meta_end_dot_

 note to self do not name your child bill third given the patronage the clintons have shown bill richardson in the past what with his energy secretary position and un ambassador position you d think he d want to pay them back _meta_end_dot_

 never underestimate a politician s ability to bite the hand that feeds him _meta_end_dot_

 lastly richardson has tried to position himself as a new ideas middle of the road democrat _meta_end_dot_

 given obama s far left credentials and shoddy resume of hope and fluff we should remind ourselves that when most democrats talk about being new democrats they really mean old democrats they hope everyone has forgotten about _meta_end_dot_

 oh what the heck one more point given bill richardson s repeated poor judgment over the years and a habitual ability to ride the coat tails of losers i will again say that i relish having obama as the democratic nominee _meta_end_dot_
