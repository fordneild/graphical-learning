  one of the striking things about barack obama s campaign is that for all his rhetorical nods to centrism and non partisanship he has systematically burned his bridges with every effort made by electorally successful democrats to actually put centrism and moderation into practice and even gone out of his way to distance himself from some of the more popular aspects of his party s record while embracing ideas the national democrats have run away from as being electorally poisonous _meta_end_dot_

 there s a case to be made that the economy of the _meta_number_ref_s was not fundamentally as good as it looked at the time recall the popping of the internet bubble that some of the credit for that economy goes to the post _meta_number_ref_ policies of republicans in congress and at the state and local levels in places like michigan wisconsin and new york city that some also goes to historically unique factors the rapid expansion of democracy and world trade and a time of unprecedented peace as well as technology spending in advance of y_meta_number_ref_k and that the clinton administration s greatest contributions to the boom years were policies obama now explicitly opposes from nafta to capital gains tax cuts _meta_end_dot_

 but despite all of that the good economic times under the last democratic president is an asset with the public s goodwill that no sane democrat would tamper with _meta_end_dot_

 but senator obama has the audacity to do just that _meta_beep_ref_ by distancing himself from the clintons senator obama is just underlining the obvious that on economic matters his proposals would be more of a return to the only other democratic president of the past four decades jimmy carter _meta_end_dot_
