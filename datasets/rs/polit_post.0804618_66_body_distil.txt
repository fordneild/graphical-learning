  yesterday we saw that clinton still leads in oh and pa by a good _meta_number_ref_ _meta_percent_ref_ margin _meta_end_dot_

 today _meta_number_ref_ new tx polls all show a clinton lead rasmussen obama _meta_number_ref_ insideradvantage obama _meta_number_ref_ tcul hamilton obama _meta_number_ref_ clinton needs to win these _meta_number_ref_ states to keep the race within the too close to call range that allows mi fl and super delegates to matter _meta_end_dot_

 i still believe that if obama is the clear democratic winner the insiders will not throw the election for clinton _meta_end_dot_

 rep _meta_end_dot_

 lewis a clinton supporter today said he will use his super delegate vote to vote for obama _meta_end_dot_

 if clinton supporters are already saying such things undecided super delegates are even more likely to ratify the democratic choice _meta_end_dot_

 however hillary winning tx oh on mar _meta_number_ref_ and pa in april could make it close enough that there isn t a clear democratic winner _meta_end_dot_

 that s when insiders and mi fl could matter and moe could be throwing a party _meta_end_dot_

 internals analysis below only rasmussen has internals in a readable format and they are for paying members only _meta_end_dot_

 here are the interesting ones clinton obama whites _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ other _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ this seems to corroborate the racialized primary voting theory _meta_end_dot_

 obama slowly but surely increased his portion of the white vote to _meta_percent_ref_ but it s not enough to overcome the strong other mostly hispanic vote for clinton _meta_end_dot_

 by income most groups go about _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ for clinton except _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref__meta_beep_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ favs clinton _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ this may be one of the few states where clinton has a noticeable led in the favorability numbers _meta_end_dot_
