  it has evidently been gotten _meta_end_dot_

 most interesting _meta_end_dot_

 i presume that by this act bill richardson has gotten himself into the good graces of the clintons again and that james carville will say something along the lines of judas _meta_end_question_

 oh i meant that richardson was like moses the next time he is asked about the biblical analogy he drew concerning the governor of new mexico _meta_end_dot_

 incidentally you have to wonder why it is that hugo chavez is willing to endorse obama _meta_end_dot_

 i am sure that the senator means well with his policy proposals but perhaps in caracas some of them will find favor because the chavez regime calculates that the implementation of certain portions of obama s foreign policy agenda will only serve to allow chavez s habit of meddling in the affairs of other nations to go unchecked _meta_end_dot_
