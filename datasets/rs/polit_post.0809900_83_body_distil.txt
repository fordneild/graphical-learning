  some of my fellow redstate contributors and i were discussing via email today why it is that a certain segment of the population is determined to push condi rice for veep as though it would be a good idea for the entire executive branch to run like the state department currently does _meta_end_dot_

 during the course of this conversation which inevitably turned to potentially good choices for vice president an unexpected name came up rhode island governor donald carcieri _meta_end_dot_

 more below _meta_end_dot_

 i was initially very skeptical of this suggestion _meta_end_dot_

 i didn t know much about carcieri s record and so i just automatically assumed that a guy who got elected twice in statewide rhode island elections had to be pretty moderate especially if he survived the slaughter of _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 i was pleasantly surprised to learn that i was mostly wrong _meta_end_dot_

 it turns out that among other things don carcieri is pro life _meta_end_dot_

 the comments attributed to the governor and his wife in that article were positively shocking to me for their strength _meta_end_dot_

 he has also taken strong stances in favor of traditional families _meta_end_dot_

 carcieri is also a much stronger opponent of illegal immigration than is mccain which might help to offset mccain s biggest weakness with the republican base _meta_end_dot_

 carcieri has grown somewhat less popular within rhode island over the last two years and one of the primary reasons appears to be that he has supply sider instincts _meta_end_dot_

 the state of rhode island ran into a _meta_dollor_ref_ million budget shortfall and instead of addressing the problem by raising taxes or fees carcieri responded by revamping the entire government including the layoffs of over _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ government employees _meta_end_dot_

 watch this series of videos here where carcieri discusses his decisions with a local reporter and you will see that carcieri s budgetary instincts are sound and surprisingly conservative _meta_end_dot_

 also it should be noted that carcieri makes all the right sorts of enemies _meta_end_dot_

 i offer you exhibit a carcieri also has a very interesting and diverse background including experience in education business and manufacturing _meta_end_dot_

 his expertise in financial matters would offset one of mccain s confessed weaknesses _meta_end_dot_

 carcieri has also earned a reputation in rhode island as being a guy who is willing to take on one of the most notoriously corrupt state governments in the country experience that could help allay the general public dissatisfaction with politics as usual in washington _meta_end_dot_

 now have i heard anything at all that indicates that don carcieri is actually being considered by mccain _meta_end_question_

 no _meta_end_dot_

 but i think his resume clearly indicates that he should be _meta_end_dot_

 no carcieri probably isn t going to help the republican ticket carry rhode island which went to kerry by _meta_number_ref_ points but the value of vice presidential picks in that regard has always been overstated _meta_end_dot_

 i think it s very possible that carcieri could help mccain nationally as a guy the nation would feel comfortable having his hand on the wheel in the event that anything might happen to mccain _meta_end_dot_

 and for that reason carcieri should at the very least be on mccain s long list for veep choices if not his short one _meta_end_dot_
