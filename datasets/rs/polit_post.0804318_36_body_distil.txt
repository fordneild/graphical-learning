  my employers at stop her now made an early decision to not make fun of chelsea clinton in the satire they produce _meta_end_dot_

 besides questions about taste it is clearly an area fraught with risk _meta_end_dot_

 better to leave it alone _meta_end_dot_

 and i have followed this advice in my own blogging on hillary _meta_end_dot_

 but the recent contretemps about david shuster s comments raises the issue in a different context as alex has noted _meta_end_dot_

 an article at slate makes a compelling argument that journalists should re think their approach to chelsea even in the face of the hillary campaign s attempt to punish shuster and msnbc and use it to their advantage _meta_end_dot_

 i realize i am not the first person to point this out but could it be that bill and hillary s in many ways understandable reaction to shuster s comments nevertheless disguise an attempt at political advantage _meta_end_question_

 guy branum certainly thinks so and he makes a strong case _meta_end_dot_

 more after the jump _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 here is the heart of branum s argument i think this is exactly right _meta_end_dot_

 if chelsea is going to be an active part of the campaign then she should be treated as such _meta_end_dot_

 how can she campaign for votes and make speeches and yet not be open to questions or even face the press in any way _meta_end_question_

 the whole debate over the term pimped out is beside the point and shuster was stupid to allow such language to derail his valid point _meta_end_dot_

 does anyone really think he was attempting to comment on chelsea s sexuality _meta_end_question_

 of course not _meta_end_dot_

 the bigger point is that the clinton s are trying to use every possible weapon to win and avoid scrutiny to the greatest degree possible _meta_end_dot_

 whenever a controversy arises the clintons immediately play victim blame the press and seek to leverage it their advantage _meta_end_dot_

 that is exactly what is happening here _meta_end_dot_

 i don t mean to imply that chelsea should suddenly become fair game for whatever people want to throw at her _meta_end_dot_

 or that vulgarity however common should be overlooked _meta_end_dot_

 only that the hillary campaign shouldn t be allowed to use the legitimate sympathy many feel toward chelsea as leverage to attack the press and avoid scrutiny _meta_end_dot_

 obviously conservatives have their own problems with the media _meta_end_dot_

 but we should not allow these disagreements to color our perspective _meta_end_dot_

 every time the clintons successfully brush back the media it lays the groundwork for more such intimidation come the general election _meta_end_dot_
