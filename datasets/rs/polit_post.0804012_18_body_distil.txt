  fred thompson said late friday he was endorsing mccain mccain offered to meet disaffected conservatives halfway _meta_end_dot_

 he vowed to lower taxes appoint judges of the character and quality of justices roberts and alito and reject big government solutions to health care reminded the audience of his continuing support for the war declaring i intend to win the war read on _meta_end_dot_

 what is most important for those of us who have quibbles over some of mccain s positions mccain promised to listen sure we all have at least some quibbles with mccain _meta_end_dot_

 we have some quibbles with everyone _meta_end_dot_

 but my quibbles with mccain recede past the level of insignificance when compared to the enormous disagreements i have with either possible democratic nominee _meta_end_dot_

 we need not go through the list issue by issue _meta_end_dot_

 it is more than enough to just briefly consider what the two possible democratic presidential candidates those darlings of the liberal progressive left wing promise they will do every time they recite their stump speeches retreat from iraq even as we are making significant progress in the longterm effort there collect and spend billions an billions more in taxes expanding the big government nanny state so that it controls more and more of our lives etcetera etcetera etcetera _meta_end_dot_

 to those who say they think they would rather sit out the election than meet mccain halfway i respectfully ask that you reconsider _meta_end_dot_

 is such a course of action responsible _meta_end_question_

 does leaving the field to your opponents ever help your cause to prevail _meta_end_question_

 i think not _meta_end_dot_

 i m not suggesting that you change your mind and advocate or support positions with which you disagree _meta_end_dot_

 the discussion on those points can continue until some common understanding is reached _meta_end_dot_

 no all i ask is that you respond to the olive branch offered by john mccain and just meet the presumptive republican presidential nominee half way _meta_end_dot_
