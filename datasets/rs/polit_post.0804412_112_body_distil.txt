  as always i m drawing numbers from here and rounding is to two decimal places mostly because i can t remember how to set the calculator to four decimal places anyway _meta_end_dot_

 so big day for barack obama not great day for hillary clinton i believe that she was expecting it but it still wasn t great _meta_end_dot_

 as of this moment obama has a soft total of _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ delegates he needs _meta_number_ref_ for the nomination there are _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ remaining which means that he needs to acquire _meta_percent_ref_ of the remaining delegates to win the nomination on the first ballot _meta_end_dot_

 meanwhile hillary clinton has a soft total _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ delegates_meta_beep_ref_ she needs _meta_number_ref_ for the nomination there are _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ remaining which means that she needs to acquire _meta_percent_ref_ of the remaining delegates to win the nomination on the first ballot _meta_end_dot_

 this represents a mild drop for her from the last time and a significant increase for obama _meta_end_dot_

 the above assumes that the fl mi delegates will not be seated _meta_end_dot_

 should they be seated without changes_meta_beep_ref_ then obama will need _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ of the remaining delegates this figure includes the _meta_number_ref_ uncommitted delegates as being available which i should have done last time while clinton requires _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 conclusions _meta_end_question_

 the race is tied _meta_end_dot_

 obama has momentum clinton has several weeks worth of breathing space _meta_end_dot_

 hawaii will go for obama probably wisconsin will probably be a _meta_number_ref_x _meta_number_ref_x split and i don t know which way yet and oh tx will be all in for clinton and if he s smart obama because he needs a staggering win _meta_percent_ref_ in both of those states to knock clinton out _meta_end_dot_

 here s why _meta_end_dot_

 there are currently _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ pledged delegates left _meta_end_dot_

 obama has _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ pledged delegates which means that he would need _meta_number_ref_ of the remaining pledged delegates or _meta_percent_ref_ to win the nomination as every major party presidential nominee has won in the last _meta_number_ref_ years which is to say automatically on the first ballot and the party can go on to other things _meta_end_dot_

 hillary currently needs _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ pledged delegates or _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 this does not mean that the nomination will not be settled on the first ballot it s very likely that it will be _meta_end_dot_

 what it does mean is that the democratic nomination is going to be in the end and for the first time in many of our readers lifetimes decided actually at the convention by the _meta_number_ref_ super delegates_meta_beep_ref_ and there are no buttons on the calculator to push to give you a confident answer on how they ll go _meta_end_dot_

 no really and truly there aren t _meta_end_dot_

 cool huh _meta_end_question_

 moe lane there is a technicality about this total that i am already aware of but will not compensate for until it is resolved by the democratic party which should be soon _meta_end_dot_

 i do not think that it will seriously adjust the final numbers anyway _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_beep_ref_and so far the dnc shows no sign of finding a compromise that the states like and the states are well aware that they have the upper hand in this debate _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_beep_ref_i hear the question but what if hillary drops out before then the answer is that of course there s a point where the situation becomes hopeless in practical terms for her _meta_end_dot_

 the problem for obama is that the actual number is higher than most people realize _meta_end_dot_

 based on my gut check a _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ split in tx and oh will sufficiently wreck public perceptions of her candidacy but that s highly unlikely in fact i don t expect her to lose either state _meta_end_dot_

 and seeing as those two states plus pa which i don t think that she ll lose either make up roughly _meta_number_ref_ of the total delegates remaining once those get resolved the possibility of a pre convention knockout blow fades _meta_end_dot_
