  i cannot put it better than juan williams put it on fox news yesterday but i will reiterate it the more we learn about barack obama the more we learn he is an inauthentic disingenuous politician who does not offer hope and change but more of the same _meta_end_dot_

 in his past barack obama used his connections to jeremiah williams and his church to solidify himself in the black community _meta_end_dot_

 al sharpton has questioned the genuineness of obama s commitment to the black community but obama has been able to hide behind his mentor jeremiah wright whose commitment is not questioned _meta_end_dot_

 for twenty years obama has attended a church whose preacher has focused on the topic of black nationalism _meta_end_dot_

 jesus was persecuted by the white man rev _meta_end_dot_

 wright claims just as the white man even no persecutes the black man _meta_end_dot_

 obama has relied on those ties to help him overcome questions of authenticity and commitment to his community _meta_end_dot_

 unfortunately for obama his ties to his church are no longer convenient _meta_end_dot_

 he has tried to disown the rhetoric of his church without disowning his pastor _meta_end_dot_

 the church itself and the united church of christ not to be confused with the church of christ an actual christian denomination have struck back against what they label a character assassination and now comes this news that obama was in the attendance one sunday morning when rev _meta_end_dot_

 wright for now though let s ignore the fact that obama was in attendance during at least one of these hate filled anti american sermons and never objected _meta_end_dot_

 let s instead consider this _meta_end_dot_

 obama has been a congregant at this church for _meta_number_ref_ years _meta_end_dot_

 in every church i have ever attended in small groups of friends from church the topic of the church inevitably come up _meta_end_dot_

 statements of the preacher inevitably come up _meta_end_dot_

 sermons come up _meta_end_dot_

 church activism and evangelism comes up _meta_end_dot_

 it defies credibility for obama to claim no knowledge of his own preacher s statements from his own church s pulpit over a span of twenty years _meta_end_dot_

 either obama goes to church for show and has no relations within the church in which case he is a fraud or he does have relations in the church and does pay attention in which case he s just a liar _meta_end_dot_

 either way the change he s offering no longer looks like it amounts to much _meta_end_dot_

 update by leon here is a smattering of jeremiah wright s sermons if you wall want to spend some time with youtube this afternoon you will get the clear picture that there is no way whatsoever that barack obama did not know the sorts of things his pastor apparently says on a regular basis _meta_end_dot_

 be warned some of this material might not be stuff you want to listen to if you re at work i especially like the part about the government inventing hiv as a means of eradicating black people _meta_end_dot_

 yeesh _meta_end_dot_
