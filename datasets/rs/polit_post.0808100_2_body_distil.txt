  this is a question that has been nagging me for quite some time _meta_end_dot_

 is there any way that hillary s past ends up having a major impact on this campaign _meta_end_question_

 obviously that past has already had an impact in that it has played a role in a certain segment of the population choosing not to vote for her some indications are that it is a sizable and committed segment of voters _meta_end_dot_

 but what i am getting at is whether that information is already baked in or whether there are voters considering voting for hillary or who are noncommittal who could be reminded of the huge pile of baggage hillary carries and change their minds _meta_end_dot_

 the media focus on hillary s release of her schedule this week is a perfect example _meta_end_dot_

 i understand the desire to find new information to break a story but there is so much information we already know about her that is less than flattering that i wonder if people think it is a legitimate subject of discussion _meta_end_dot_

 do democrats simply not want to believe that hillary played a role in all the scandals and problems of the clinton white house _meta_end_question_

 does character and integrity not matter _meta_end_question_

 read on _meta_end_dot_

 she has a long history of everything from stonewalling the media shading and hedging the truth in deceptive ways to downright lying _meta_end_dot_

 she seems almost incapable of telling the whole truth in a forthright way _meta_end_dot_

 it started from the very beginning _meta_end_dot_

 when her husband first faced questions about his infidelities hillary acidly remarked that she wasn t just some women standing by her man like the tammy wynette song _meta_end_dot_

 but in fact that is exactly what she was doing and continued to do each and every time a bimbo eruption occured _meta_end_dot_

 she stonewalled and lied about her investments in arkansas about her involvement in whitewater and castle grande about her role in travelgate and about the handling of the rose law firm billing papers and about the vince foster s papers etc _meta_end_dot_

 etc _meta_end_dot_

 etc _meta_end_dot_

 this pattern continued in the campaign _meta_end_dot_

 she exaggerates her experience and denies any responsibility for the mistakes and scandals _meta_end_dot_

 she claimed she has always been against nafta despite having lobbied congress for it on behalf of her husband _meta_end_dot_

 she takes credit for balancing the budget and welfare reform even though she opposed both at the time _meta_end_dot_

 both bill and hillary constantly claim that they were guilty of nothing that they have been exonerated from all guilt just because they aren t in jail _meta_end_dot_

 is this the type of candidate democrats want as their standard bearer _meta_end_question_

 do these ethical lapses and serial lies not mean anything to the blue collar types who seem to support her _meta_end_question_

 it seems to me that the clintons have successfully pushed that baggage behind them and labeled it as old news _meta_end_dot_

 hillary brags of being the most transparent figure in public life despite a career of deception spin and lies _meta_end_dot_

 hillary is the real audacious one in my book _meta_end_dot_

 what do you think _meta_end_question_

 do people care about hillary s past _meta_end_question_

 or is that a creation of the vast right wing conspiracy and thus off limits for the democrats _meta_end_question_

 will the average voter care about this past should hillary somehow win the nomination _meta_end_question_

 a hillary win seems far fetched for now but we all know the clintons will not go away with out a fight to the death _meta_end_dot_

 that is something obama is thinking a lot about right now i bet _meta_end_dot_
