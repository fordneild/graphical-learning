 the endpoint here is the same as it always is with socialist systems it s financially unsustainable to equalize everyone by providing the best care universally so instead the government makes us all equal by giving everyone the worst _meta_end_dot_

 this in the end is the portrait of what america s health care system would look like under obama or hillary a middle aged woman dying unnecessarily of breast cancer so we can all feel equal _meta_end_dot_

 hey it works in europe _meta_end_exclamation_
