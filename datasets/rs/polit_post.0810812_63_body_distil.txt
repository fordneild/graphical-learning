  please ask him if he would attend a fundraiser or meeting of local activists at tom coburn s house _meta_end_dot_

 when obama chuckles and says coburn would never invite him to do that because he is supporting john mccain ask him again ask if coburn did invite obama over to meet with local neighborhood activists or to raise money for obama s campaign would obama go _meta_end_question_

 he went to bill ayers house _meta_end_dot_

 of course the issue here is simple if obama says no he puts legal trial and death penalty for abortionists in a place worse than terrorists who try to blow up institutions of american government _meta_end_dot_

 if he says yes well he s fu screwed with the naral gang _meta_end_dot_

 now mr mrs miss ms _meta_end_dot_

 reporter that last bit is irrelevant to you _meta_end_dot_

 what is relevant is that he attended a gathering on his behalf at bill ayers house _meta_end_dot_

 would he go to tom coburn s house for the same _meta_end_question_

 that is the relevant part and the part you must ask if you want to be objective in covering this race _meta_end_dot_
