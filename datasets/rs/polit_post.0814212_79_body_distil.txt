  do you know what s more fun than giving good advice to democrats when you know that they ll ignore it _meta_end_question_

 watching a democrat do it to fellow democrats _meta_end_dot_

 it s doubly fun when it s salon doing it _meta_end_dot_

 via rcp ouch _meta_end_dot_

 read on _meta_end_dot_

 the crux of ms _meta_end_dot_

 presumably davis s argument is that there seems to be a growing shift away from rural voters and towards urban ones _meta_end_dot_

 she goes less into the reasons for this but you get the definite impression that in her and for that matter my mind one critical factor is that the democrats are increasingly being run by people who don t like rural areas very much _meta_end_dot_

 or to be nicer although i can t imagine why i m bothering at least being run by people who don t really understand rural voters _meta_end_dot_

 it s most obvious in the appalachian area but it s no secret that obama s support is based on urban suburban affluent white people and african americans he does badly with rural and working class white people and he s not getting particularly better at it as the race goes on and on and on and on and on _meta_end_dot_

 which is a real problem for the democrats because they can t win elections without the rural vote _meta_end_dot_

 from the article ms _meta_end_dot_

 davis is hopeful that senator obama can reverse this while i am of course biased i still think that she s ignoring the peculiar emotional appeal that rural baiting has for the urban population particularly that of the younger urban suburban vote that is disproportionately for the junior senator from illinois _meta_end_dot_

 they aren t particularly interested in playing nice with others thank god and while they mostly don t vote they do give money just as good right so the democrats as a whole have to treat them carefully _meta_end_dot_

 so you get situations like this and before you object note that harold ford jr _meta_end_dot_

 had the exact same complaint via instapundit _meta_end_dot_

 what davis and ford either don t recognize or just won t say is that this isn t the strategy of a man who s clinched the nomination this is the strategy of a man who s maintaining a primary election strategy and worrying about the general election one later _meta_end_dot_

 he would have been and would be better off thinking in terms of november as well as august _meta_end_dot_

 but never mind me _meta_end_dot_

 no really _meta_end_dot_

 much obliged _meta_end_dot_
