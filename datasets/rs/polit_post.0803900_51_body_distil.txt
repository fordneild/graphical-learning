  when aleksandr isaevich solzhenitsyn delivered a brief address to a town hall meeting in cavendish vermont where he had lived for eighteen years with his family in exile from communist russia he paid poignant homage to the sensible and sure process of grassroots democracy in which the local population solves most of its problems on its own not waiting for the decisions of higher authorities he declared also that while exile is always difficult he could not imagine a better place to live and wait and wait for my return home than that little town _meta_end_dot_

 he expressed his gratitude for its respect for his privacy and spoke warmly of its neighborliness _meta_end_dot_

 for his children vermont is home for they have grown up alongside your children with a god bless you all the great russian finished to a hearty ovation from those snowbound new englanders _meta_end_dot_

 calm down and read on _meta_end_dot_

 that sensible and sure democracy is the american political tradition in summary _meta_end_dot_

 solzhenitsyn like tocqueville before him readily perceived the importance of this self government of the township in american history _meta_end_dot_

 but the most striking thing about it which stands in defiance of so much else in america is its essential smallness _meta_end_dot_

 it is not grandiose but rather modest it does boast of its expansiveness but takes pride in its limitation from which it takes its form _meta_end_dot_

 there is much in america that is big and bulky and boisterous and the paradox is that the foundation of our political tradition is indelibly small and unobtrusive self government on the scale of an organic community of freemen _meta_end_dot_

 in the federalist the very smallness of our system by a feat of theoretical genius is conceived as the ground upon which to construct what jefferson later would call an empire of liberty _meta_end_dot_

 thousands of sensible but sure democracies organized together into larger communities of the several states would together unite into a vast republic and stand free and brave among the nations of the earth _meta_end_dot_

 it is a very fine ideal _meta_end_dot_

 but even as an ideal it was always tightly tethered to the continual hubbub and practice of self government _meta_end_dot_

 more than that the republic was consecrated by sensible and sure statesmen in many of her formative years _meta_end_dot_

 few were pure idea men they were mostly well educated thoroughly introduced to the classics of human thought but at base men of action _meta_end_dot_

 and of virtue _meta_end_dot_

 nor should we deceive ourselves that such men were really the norm in that age or any age _meta_end_dot_

 in truth the early republic was crawling with adventurers and charlatans with opportunities and energumen _meta_end_dot_

 duels were a common sight _meta_end_dot_

 the wild unknown country beckoned the ambitious the delinquent the nefarious _meta_end_dot_

 finance was erratic and ungoverned _meta_end_dot_

 burr and wilkinson the latter in the pay of the spanish conspired at insurrection in louisiana _meta_end_dot_

 burr conspired with british and spanish agents to carve out an autocracy in mexico _meta_end_dot_

 they had accomplices stoolies mountebanks swindlers bankrupt capitalists mercenaries and the like all swirling around them like flies _meta_end_dot_

 the republic fought a war against pirates _meta_end_dot_

 the fact that burr was vice president and not autocrat and the fact that wilkinson s prudence impelled him to betray the former to jefferson and a dozen other such facts with which i am not familiar only demonstrates what a miracle the united states of america has been _meta_end_dot_

 so even in this bare sketch we see that the idea of america is bound down or anchored in _meta_number_ref_ sensible and sure small democracies that is a lived tradition of self government _meta_number_ref_ wise and prudent statesmen _meta_number_ref_ the virtue of her rulers and _meta_number_ref_ good fortune _meta_end_dot_

 by my count that is one abstraction set against four real facts or practicalities _meta_end_dot_

 what then should we make of the school of thought which would construct in our minds an america that is made up of abstractions only or ideas foremost _meta_end_question_

 what should we make of the theory that what is best most memorial admirable great unique etc about america is the idea alone a theory often advanced so fervently not to say feverishly that not rarely does in tend toward derision or haughty dismissal of the facts or practicalities _meta_end_question_

 i think we should make of it that it is false and pernicious _meta_end_dot_

 to me though the ideas forming our abstractions our abbreviations of traditions in michael oakeshott s phrase are certainly admirable and interesting what is really more interesting are these facts or practicalities and the providence which brought them together here on our shores _meta_end_dot_

 what great good fortune it is that our high and noble ideals ideals which with some variation became monstrous in the hands of the french were infused by the grit and experience of all those sensible and sure democracies _meta_end_exclamation_

 how the hand of providence blessed us by our leaders _meta_end_exclamation_

 and so on _meta_end_dot_

 moreover the ideals are rather easy to replicate as abstractions _meta_end_dot_

 any merely competent wordsmith with a bit of learning may write up a constitution for a republic _meta_end_dot_

 any fool may declare his love of democracy _meta_end_dot_

 what is rather more difficult to replicate however is a lived tradition of self government _meta_end_dot_

 there is indeed still some puzzle and consternation over the most reliable way to raise up virtuous leaders _meta_end_dot_

 there is no abstraction by which we may discover the secret to grasping and holding capricious fortuna _meta_end_dot_

 and only by terrible pride or crippling flippancy would we dare to force the hand of providence _meta_end_dot_

 this is my challenge to all the propositionalists the creedal nationalists the ideological patriots the abstractors of america now and then fellas set aside the abstractions and ideals or if you must discuss them in earnest make sure your discussions are grounded emphatically in the american tradition and not in some alien accretion brought in by the liberalism that has dominated our academics for _meta_number_ref_ years _meta_end_dot_

 instead focus your attention now and then on the practicalities the facts the providence or fortuna which grounded the american republic _meta_end_dot_

 discover how and why abraham lincoln developed his rhetorical genius that lincoln music as shelby foote calls it not from the abstractions of theorists but the rough realism of the backcountry and the king james bible _meta_end_dot_

 study the federalist carefully read it as a unity as you would a great work of statesmanship and philosophy which it is and report on what you learn _meta_end_dot_

 purchase this magnificent volume offered at a remarkably low price and immerse yourself in political tradition of america unfiltered by the machinations of academia _meta_end_dot_

 try to recover for yourself something of our tradition at the art of rhetoric that quintessential political art which alone can appeal to the dual nature of man as a creature who reasons and who feels _meta_end_dot_

 we were once a nation of great orators you know _meta_end_dot_

 h _meta_end_dot_

 l _meta_end_dot_

 mencken who was not a man given to inordinate praise wrote that the american from the beginning has been the most ardent of recorded rhetoricians investigate the fundamental smallness of american self government which caught the eye of penetrating observers like tocqueville and solzhenitsyn _meta_end_dot_

 realize the important of limitation and self discipline in this way of life _meta_end_dot_

 come on boys i dare ya _meta_end_dot_

 i ll be right there with you for this is the true work of conservatism that our country needs _meta_end_dot_
