  so barack obama has this little problem he can t seem to win working class white voters _meta_end_dot_

 with rare exception iowa missouri he basically only wins states and in particular only wins primaries where all the working class white voters are already republicans leaving the democrats a stripped down shell of african americans and college towns _meta_end_dot_

 obama s biggest victory in the past two months was in mississippi _meta_end_dot_

 but if obama wants to win a national election he s going to have to win the states where the democrats are in better shape than they are in mississippi _meta_end_dot_

 time was working class whites were the backbone the very reason for the existence of the democratic party fdr s forgotten man what obama is running on instead is essentially the mcgovern coalition _meta_end_dot_

 but even in its headiest days most of the old mcgovernites realized that it wasn t such a great idea to just kick fdr s old stalwarts to the curb _meta_end_dot_

 the smart play for obama at this point is to run out the clock squeeze out the delegate margin he needs say nothing bad about these folks for supporting hillary and try like heck to win them back in november _meta_end_dot_

 as we saw with the now infamous san francisco fundraiser obama forgot that lesson when he thought nobody was listening and pennsylvania voters were understandably er bitter about that _meta_end_dot_

 but this is a new one even for the obama campaign his chief strategist now says that obama doesn t need those people because nationally fdr s old forgotten man is a republican anyway audio here _meta_end_dot_

 as the politico s ben smith notes this ignores the fact that t he whites getting surveyed in exit polls are people who voted in a democratic primary in any event it s nice for white working class voters to know where they stand with obama s campaign _meta_end_dot_

 not to worry though the gop is happy to have your votes _meta_end_dot_

 and we re perfectly happy to see the national democratic party achieve the success it has had in say utah or wyoming or mississippi _meta_end_dot_
