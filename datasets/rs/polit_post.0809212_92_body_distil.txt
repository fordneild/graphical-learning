  this _meta_number_ref_ year war tug of war foolishness between obama and mccain has gone far enough _meta_end_dot_

 barack obama is lying staight faced to his followers and he knows it _meta_end_dot_

 his campaign co chair is on record stating categorically that iraq is just the first of our middle east occupations barack obama would have you believe that our being in iraq is a bad thing _meta_end_dot_

 he is against war well war in iraq _meta_end_dot_

 but has no problem expanding it in afghanistan _meta_end_dot_

 according to a piece in the wsj today fine _meta_end_dot_

 he wants to send _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ us soldiers to afghanistan to beat up an already badly broken taliban and rummage through caves looking for a couple old guys with cell phones and laptops running the war on terror _meta_end_dot_

 whatever _meta_end_dot_

 that he wants no soldiers in the streets of iraq to provide the necessary security and support for iraqi citizens to conduct business feed and clothe their families and educate themselves escapes me but even this is beside the point _meta_end_dot_

 obama s people are saying the same thing mccain is saying about iraq and the greater middle east _meta_end_dot_

 they are correct in suggesting we will continue exerting our lone superpower status and they are even factually fair in pointing out that we don t always exert that status appropriately _meta_end_dot_

 we make mistakes sometimes too after all _meta_end_dot_

 we ve made our share in iraq to be sure but leaving the place isn t how you correct them is it mr _meta_end_dot_

 i want to be president without ever having to face reality more below the lies and the liars that tell them fold _meta_end_dot_

 obama is getting a free pass from the anti war media despite the fact that the reality of war and peace is quite clear in the minds of his advisers _meta_end_dot_

 obama is lying to you _meta_end_dot_

 an obama administration will treat the middle east no differently than a mccain administration reality and all that non fluff stuff barry likes to lie to you about being what it is _meta_end_dot_

 this election is about the mess he s going to make of the us the economy the health care system the tax burdens on all of us the small businesses he ll singlehandedly destroy and the number and manner by which more innocent unborn children will be killed it s not about how he ll deal with iraq differently read pull them out of iraq and send them to afghanistan because he won t _meta_end_dot_

 the wsj piece suggests obama might not understand the meaning of defeat _meta_end_dot_

 he needs to get the crash course on it in november _meta_end_dot_

 in the close wsj s bret stephens reminds us of a passage in the speech heard round the world when obama noted that there was no point trying to best mr _meta_end_dot_

 mccain in matters of experience that what counted was good judgment _meta_end_dot_

 good judgment might have been for obama to let go of the _meta_number_ref_ years war rhetoric before the dots were connected between his lies to us on iraq or his poor judgment in selecting a campaign co chair who sees iraq exactly the same as mccain does _meta_end_dot_

 move to a new subject barry we know all about what you won t be doing in iraq _meta_end_dot_
