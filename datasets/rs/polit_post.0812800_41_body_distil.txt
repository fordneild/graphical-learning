  update at _meta_percent_ref_ it s clinton obama _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ clearly cnn is waiting for a couple counties before risking calling the race cbs already has for clinton _meta_end_dot_

 there s going to be a lot of excited obama supporters about this the poor fellows update with _meta_percent_ref_ of the vote in it s _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ clinton _meta_end_dot_

 this number will go down too urban votes will almost certainly eat into that _meta_end_dot_

 given the exit polls i m thinking a high single possibly double digit victory for clinton update the first results are in and with a whopping _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ votes counted clinton is meaninglessly ahead _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 that will undoubtedly shrink _meta_end_dot_

 moe as always results here _meta_end_dot_

 polls close at _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ but it s going to apparently be a while before we get actual results so here s a bit for your amusement until then clinton needs to win but any win will suit her needs _meta_end_dot_
