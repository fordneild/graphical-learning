  trevor phillips one of britain s most influential black figures accuses barack obama of cynically exploiting america s racial divide and warned that obama could prolong the rift phillips gets to that conclusion after discussing shelby steele s theory that there are two kinds of influential black figures in us public life _meta_end_dot_

 the challengers such as garvey malcolm x and jackson wield power by making whites feel guilty about the old crime and only allowing the guilt to be relieved in return for concessions of one kind or another the second type bargainers such as poitier king bill cosby and oprah winfrey strike a different deal by saying to white america i will not use america s horrible history of white racism against you if you will promise not to use my race against me see steele s new book about obama a bound man why we are excited about obama and why he can t win i have lots of problems with obama _meta_end_dot_

 i think obama is a naive extreme left wing liberal who talks of hope of achieving camelot by governing in a nonpartisan manner _meta_end_dot_

 despite his call for change and who doesn t want to change things obama hasn t even made an effort to do anything in a bipartisan let alone nonpartisan way _meta_end_dot_

 nevertheless i have never thought of obama s candidacy of exploiting the racial divide _meta_end_dot_

 no that was done by bill clinton on behalf of hillary s campaign _meta_end_dot_

 i disagree with mr _meta_end_dot_

 phillips _meta_end_dot_

 i see obama s campaign as evidence we are making racial progress in america _meta_end_dot_

 i m not about to vote for him but that has nothing to do with obama s race _meta_end_dot_

 it has everything to do with the fact that i agree with senator mccain when he describes obama s endless mantra as an eloquent but empty call for change
