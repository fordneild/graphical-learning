  first congratulations to mike huckabee _meta_end_dot_

 he shined tonight _meta_end_dot_

 as i said earlier today i expect mike huckabee and mitt romney to beat each other to the death like two drag queens wearing the same dress at the same party _meta_end_dot_

 mike huckabee you did well _meta_end_dot_

 now you can get some money and try to go further _meta_end_dot_

 you deserve the win tonight but let s be honest _meta_end_dot_

 your win was mccain s by proxy _meta_end_dot_

 big loser tonight though ed rollins _meta_end_dot_

 he imploded on fox news _meta_end_dot_

 totally imploded _meta_end_dot_

 mitt romney you couldn t buy iowa _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_dollor_ref_ million and now you re about to get spanked in new hampshire too _meta_end_dot_

 ouch _meta_end_dot_

 don t worry though clinton made his comeback in south carolina _meta_end_dot_

 you can make yours in michigan _meta_end_dot_

 your campaign was lackluster and playing the they re all anti mormon bigots card got you nowhere _meta_end_dot_

 bill kristol was kind enough to shoot that one down when one of your advisor s wives raised in on fox news _meta_end_dot_

 the clear winner tonight is john mccain _meta_end_dot_

 he talked up huckabee and he talked down romney _meta_end_dot_

 he sat out of iowa and still made a respectable showing in the state in fourth place as i write _meta_end_dot_

 he s going to get momentum in new hampshire now and mccain now has the clearest path to victory _meta_end_dot_

 another story tonight should be that fred thompson gets a second chance _meta_end_dot_

 according to the entrance polling late deciders broke for huckabee and thompson _meta_end_dot_

 voters who wanted to vote for someone they trusted broke for huckabee and thompson _meta_end_dot_

 huckabee isn t going to play well across the board _meta_end_dot_

 thompson getting late breakers with his game face on has a second chance in south carolina _meta_end_dot_

 big loser on the gop side rudy _meta_end_dot_

 sure he didn t play _meta_end_dot_

 but damn _meta_end_dot_

 on the democratic side edwards and hillary battle it out for second place _meta_end_dot_

 obama sweeps it _meta_end_dot_

 hillary is actually vulnerable _meta_end_dot_

 good for obama _meta_end_dot_

 ironically this pushes the democrats to the left with their guy _meta_end_dot_

 hillary actually does have more experience than obama _meta_end_dot_

 this is really phenomenal though _meta_end_dot_

 not since the early eighties have the clintons received such a drubbing by the voters _meta_end_dot_

 and bill went out of his way to campaign for her _meta_end_dot_

 this is a repudiation of the clinton legacy _meta_end_dot_

 according to entrance polling obama won massively against clinton in the _meta_number_ref_ and under crowd _meta_end_dot_

 and you know what _meta_end_question_

 women backed obama over clinton _meta_end_dot_

 so how s the identity politics working for you tonight hillary _meta_end_question_

 lastly goodnight pretty boy _meta_end_exclamation_

 john edwards who has campaigned for the job since november _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ is out _meta_end_dot_
