 moe lane matt tiabbi commentator house leftist for rollingstone com feels deeply perturbed _meta_end_dot_

 perhaps leading democratic political apparatchiks should grow perturbed that he s perturbed _meta_end_dot_

 tiabbi accuses the democrats in a polemic entitled the chicken doves of having used the iraq anti war movement for political gain _meta_end_dot_

 he appears shocked and amazed that harry reid and nancy pelosi haven t ended the iraq war and declared glorious dunkirk _meta_end_dot_

 he inveighs below that they have taken the movement to end the fighting in the middle east and used it as an electoral bludgeon _meta_end_dot_

 working behind the scenes the democrats have systematically taken over the anti war movement packing the nation s leading group with party consultants more interested in attacking the gop than ending the war _meta_end_dot_

 our focus is on the republicans one democratic apparatchik in charge of the anti war coalition declared _meta_end_dot_

 how can we juice up attacks on them tiabbi goes further and describes the democratic party s effort to end combat operations in iraq as less than muscular _meta_end_dot_

 why it just wasn t going to happen is the controversy _meta_end_dot_

 in and around the halls of congress the notion that the democrats made a sincere effort to end the war meets with at best derisive laughter _meta_end_dot_

 though few congressional aides would think of saying so on the record in private many dismiss their party s lame anti war effort as an absurd dog and pony show a calculated attempt to score political points without ever being serious about bringing the troops home _meta_end_dot_

 the author seems convinced that the democratic party has gone with a strategy centered around the audacity of political viability rather than offering any hope to genuine pacifists _meta_end_dot_

 he suggests that the entire fusillade of public pronouncements by leading democrats in congress on the iraq war is a potemkin aimed at fooling the voting public _meta_end_dot_

 tiabbi does justice to the claim that the democrats are lying about the war but he does not completely enumerate the myriad number of ways in which the democrats have become disingenuous in their pandering _meta_end_dot_

 house speaker nancy pelosi obviously won t seek membership in the george w _meta_end_dot_

 bush iraq policy fan club _meta_end_dot_

 this is all fine and good _meta_end_dot_

 however her efforts to distort the public perception of how the troop surge is proceeding in iraq would make baghdad bob or grima wormtongue blush _meta_end_dot_

 house speaker nancy pelosi d calif said twice sunday that iraq is a failure adding that president bush s troop surge has not produced the desired effect the purpose of the surge was to create a secure time for the government of iraq to make the political change to bring reconciliation to iraq pelosi said on cnn s late edition they have not done that the speaker hastened to add the troops have succeeded god bless them the true state of affairs in iraq is nowhere near as dismal as pelosi paints them _meta_end_dot_

 she criticizes iraq s government for failing to produce jeffersonian democracy while deliberately ignoring the fact that the united states needed thirteen painful years to go from declaration of independence to articles of confederation to united states constitution _meta_end_dot_

 she is correct about one thing the troops are indeed succeeding _meta_end_dot_

 when a character such as abu tariq emir of the al layin and al mashahdah sector writes a sixteen page condemnation of al quaida s strategy and ethical decision making it can t be reasonably denied that iraq has turned into a grinding humiliation and a quagmire for osama bin ladin _meta_end_dot_

 abu tariq spares no egos or vanities in his diary entries _meta_end_dot_

 we were mistreated cheated and betrayed by some of our brothers he says _meta_end_dot_

 those people were nothing but hypocrites liars and traitors and were waiting for the right moment to switch sides with whoever pays them most abu tariq s continues to write a scathing critique of the al anbar awakening that should soon grace us army powerpoint pitches worldwide _meta_end_dot_

 al qaeda s islamic state of iraq is faced with an extraordinary crisis especially in al anbar the unnamed emir admitted _meta_end_dot_

 in an apparent reference to al qaeda s brutal tactics he said of the americans and their sunni allies we helped them to unite against us _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 the americans and the apostates launched their campaigns against us and we found ourselves in a circle not being able to move organise or conduct our operations he said of the loss of anbar province this created weakness and psychological defeat _meta_end_dot_

 this also created panic fear and the unwillingness to fight _meta_end_dot_

 the morale of the fighters went down _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 there was a total collapse in the security structure of the organisation so matt tiabbi claims the war in iraq must be ended as soon as possible _meta_end_dot_

 nancy pelosi claims to have the moral authority and desire to accomplish exactly that _meta_end_dot_

 what tiabbi and pelosi quibble over is whether to surrender immediately or whether to drag the surrender out humiliate our nation demoralize our armed forces and use the war as a political bludgeon prior to waving the white flag of ineffable defeat _meta_end_dot_

 what tiabbi and pelosi have left out of the equation is that the enemy always enjoys a certain suffrage in every council of war _meta_end_dot_

 president bush used his vote to redirect us military strategy in a more effective manner _meta_end_dot_

 he put general petraeus in charge of suppressing the iraqi insurgency _meta_end_dot_

 general petraeus is using his vote to accomplish what tiabbi and pelosi both profess as their good faith objective _meta_end_dot_

 petraeus will end the war when al qaeda can no longer participate due to incapacitation _meta_end_dot_

 this will occur long before the democrats in congress would summon the necessary courage to cut off war funding under a republican president _meta_end_dot_
