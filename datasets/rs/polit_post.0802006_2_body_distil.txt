  official results will be here _meta_end_dot_

 map will be here _meta_end_dot_

 exit polls are here _meta_end_dot_

 i still want to be michael barone when i grow up _meta_end_dot_

 rock em sock em _meta_end_dot_

 update still too close to call mccain _meta_percent_ref_ to huckabee _meta_percent_ref_ with _meta_percent_ref_ reporting _meta_end_dot_

 that said knowing sc a bit from when i grew up there huckabee is underperforming in a few key areas and i predict a narrow mccain win _meta_end_dot_

 something interesting from the exit polling of age differences huckabee wins _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ and _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ by a _meta_number_ref_ percent and _meta_number_ref_ point margin respectively _meta_end_dot_

 but a full _meta_percent_ref_ of the vote was from _meta_number_ref_ voters who went for mccain at a _meta_percent_ref_ pace a _meta_number_ref_ point margin over huckabee _meta_end_dot_

 assuming mccain wins it s going to be with the older moderate voters who did it _meta_end_dot_

 i d love to see crosstabs on this _meta_end_dot_

 oh and a big thanks to martha maccallum for the kind fnc mention _meta_end_dot_

 update i think this one s johnny mac s and right after i typed this the ap and fnc called it _meta_end_dot_

 huckabee may close it up a bit more it s about a _meta_number_ref_k margin at the moment but this one s basically going to end up where mason dixon put it a week ago _meta_end_dot_

 on to florida _meta_end_exclamation_
