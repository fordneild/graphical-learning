  now this is impressive _meta_end_dot_

 writing in the new york daily news a former jihadist by the name of tawfik hamid proclaims some hard truths amen to all that and read on _meta_end_dot_

 mr _meta_end_dot_

 hamid continues rounding out his argument one of the most devious tactics used by the islamists is that common posture of outrage bluster intimidation which forbids speaking the plain truth about this virulent strain of islam for fear it might alienate or offend millions of moderate muslims i have heard this very argument innumerable times _meta_end_dot_

 the effect of it is simple and ghastly it ensures that no one will directly confront their violent ideologies and the books that contain them since under islamic sharia law no one is even allowed to challenge their contents politicians and opinion makers in the west have over time adopted a peculiar rhetorical habit in response to this devious tactic the piling up of adjectives to describe the enemy _meta_end_dot_

 radical islamic extremism violent islamic radicalism etc anything to indicate that in the speaker s mind there is an unbridgeable conceptual gap between islam as such and the enemy _meta_end_dot_

 the vital thing to understand is that this rhetorical habit is not a product of study and experience it does not emerge from facts and history _meta_end_dot_

 it is imposed a priori from a frame of mind an ideology even borne of conformity to what we call political correctness _meta_end_dot_

 to repeat my position we must keep open in our own minds and in the public square the possibility that our enemy is the organic inheritor of the primitive orthodoxy of islam _meta_end_dot_

 i do not use the word primitive as a derogative but merely as a descriptor _meta_end_dot_

 the jihadists are not innovators _meta_end_dot_

 have you read their literature _meta_end_question_

 it is stale repetitious stuff _meta_end_dot_

 its pattern was set hundreds of years ago _meta_end_dot_

 these men move in a tradition that is not of their own making _meta_end_dot_

 it is the tradition wherein the predominant concept of jihad is the threefold choice given to infidels conversion submission and tribute or death now in my view we what we should emphatically not keep open is the possibility that this threefold concept of jihad is acceptable _meta_end_dot_

 that question we should close with a loud and decisive thud like the heavy door to a crypt where death and rot do dwell _meta_end_dot_

 we should remove the promulgation of this doctrine from the protection of our laws and expose its agitators theorists preachers recruiters and provocateurs to the harassment disrepute and disability of proscription _meta_end_dot_

 we should declare it in the grand gestures of public resolution so common in republics anathema to our political tradition and moral imagination _meta_end_dot_

 we should have no truck with this wicked system _meta_end_dot_

 for we are a people who hold certain truths and by their declaration elevated ourselves to that separate and equal station to which the laws of nature and of nature s god entitle us and i ll be damned if these truths do not include a loathing of wicked systems _meta_end_dot_

 in any case i salute mr _meta_end_dot_

 hamid and the new york daily news for writing and printing one of the better articles on the jihad yet seen in the press _meta_end_dot_
