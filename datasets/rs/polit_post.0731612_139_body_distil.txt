  good morning america profiled a heroic organization with an urgent mission for our world war ii veterans _meta_end_dot_

 honor flight is an organization whose mission is to provide free trips to washington dc for wwii veterans so that they can view this country s long overdue tribute to their sacrifices _meta_end_dot_

 the world war ii memorial on the national mall is three years old _meta_end_dot_

 but many of the surviving veterans who fought in that war are too old infirm or financially unable to travel to washington themselves to see it _meta_end_dot_

 honor flight seeks to remove those obstacles for our veterans and provides them with the experience of a lifetime _meta_end_dot_

 you can see the video of the gma report here _meta_end_dot_

 honor flight was founded by retired air force captain earl morse _meta_end_dot_

 capt _meta_end_dot_

 morse is a physician s assistant whose patients include many wwii veterans _meta_end_dot_

 he started the organization after it became clear to him that many of his patients despite their desire to go to washington would be unable to do so on their own _meta_end_dot_

 the first flight took place in may of _meta_number_ref_ and consisted entirely of six private planes flying veterans to manassas virginia and then escorting the veterans to washington for a tour of the memorial _meta_end_dot_

 today honor flight partners with businesses and community groups to sponsor chartered commercial flights of _meta_number_ref_ veterans and _meta_number_ref_ sponsors each _meta_end_dot_

 world war ii veterans travel free and no donations are accepted from them _meta_end_dot_

 the cost of one flight is _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 this veteran s day please consider making a donation to this very worthwhile organization _meta_end_dot_

 or consider asking your community or church group to raise the funds necessary to sponsor a flight _meta_end_dot_

 our world war ii veterans are dying at a rate of _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ per day _meta_end_dot_

 after all they have given to this nation the least any of us can do is help them get to washington so they can see firsthand the honor and appreciation that the nation has bestowed upon them in the world war ii memorial _meta_end_dot_
