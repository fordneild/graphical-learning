  this is pretty much devastating _meta_end_dot_

 and the last line is well taken _meta_end_dot_

 in the event that this needs pointing out people are piling on from all portions of the ideological spectrum _meta_end_dot_

 and yes it is unbelievable that one of the two candidates to have made a virtue out of being a protectionist is now sneering at the protectionism of others _meta_end_dot_

 i too wonder whether senator obama really believes his own protectionist message _meta_end_dot_

 if so he is woefully misinformed _meta_end_dot_

 if not he is misleading the very people he wants to lead _meta_end_dot_
