  as chief justice roberts pointed out the core issue in today s detainee decision is the struggle between the power of congress and the power of the courts it s not whether the u s _meta_end_dot_

 has the right to detain enemy combatants and not whether non u s _meta_end_dot_

 citizen detainees have access to legal process to challenge their detention but simply whether congress has a right to define and limit those procedures as it did by statute in _meta_number_ref_ and _meta_number_ref_ or whether the supreme court has absolute authority to require that all procedural rules be determined by the district courts and reviewed by the supreme court _meta_end_dot_

 for this president and his successor however the bottom line question remains what to do with enemy combatants continue to hold them at guantanamo or some similar facility subject to the new procedures go back to congress for yet another set of rules or perhaps ship more detainees off to other countries to handle in their own way _meta_end_dot_

 in a serious world we d expect presidential candidates to present competing visions of how to answer both sets of questions _meta_end_dot_

 but the responses of the mccain and obama campaigns to today s decision shows that each is too busy struggling in their own ways with the politics of this issue to address it meaningfully _meta_end_dot_

 read on _meta_end_dot_

 let s start by noting the fact that the two statutes struck down by the court today were passed by the u s _meta_end_dot_

 senate in which both candidates sit _meta_end_dot_

 the detainee treatment act of _meta_number_ref_ a rider to military appropriations among other things provided a set of procedures and limited judicial review for detainees challenging their enemy combatant status _meta_end_dot_

 it passed _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ with both mccain and obama voting in favor _meta_end_dot_

 the court today held those procedures are not an adequate and effective substitute for habeas corpus the military commissions act of _meta_number_ref_ specifically precluded the dta s procedures from being evaded by recourse to habeas corpus review and eliminated the supreme court s jurisdiction over such cases it passed _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ with mccain voting in favor and obama voting against _meta_end_dot_

 the court held today that the mca operates as an unconstitutional suspension of the writ how did the candidates respond to the decision _meta_end_question_

 first the mccain response as related by michael goldfarb at the mccain report the excellent official campaign blog the rest of goldfarb s post smacks obama for voting against roberts _meta_end_dot_

 you can tell that goldfarb would like to go harder after the court s decision but the campaign and the candidate are constrained by mccain s own gitmo bashing and so while mccain s response sides with roberts and the statutes mccain voted for it has to be somewhat muted on the pragmatic consequences of the decision because mccain isn t really clear on what he himself would do with those detainees _meta_end_dot_

 obama meanwhile is off in his own little world unconstrained by the facts but therefore unwilling or unable to confront mccain over mccain s actual position it s not clear what obama means here _meta_end_dot_

 first if the dta s procedures are themselves a legal black hole and if he agrees with the court that they are inadequate to satisfy due process why on earth did obama vote for them _meta_end_question_

 second he s ripping mccain for support of bush s guantanamo policy completely ignoring the fact that mccain has been calling for some time for shuttering the place part of obama s strategy of pretending away mccain s actual record _meta_end_dot_

 third if obama means that mccain supported bush s policy by voting for the dta and the mca what about obama s own vote for the dta _meta_end_question_
