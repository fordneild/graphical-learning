  tim mahoney d fl is upset with republicans for blocking the don t make people deal with the consequences of their own actions act also known as the sub prime mortgage bailout _meta_end_dot_

 this is just too rich in real person speak the republicans don t want to bail out people who decided to live beyond their means _meta_end_dot_

 everyone knows taxpayers are supposed to save the irresponsible from themselves _meta_end_dot_

 in real person speak it was difficult for some people to buy a house because by any objective standard used in the free market these people could not actually afford to buy their house _meta_end_dot_

 in real person speak some people who had crummy credit and wanted to live in a house they couldn t afford sought out a way to make the deal happen after banking institutions questioned the financial ability of these people to actually you know buy a house and pay for it _meta_end_dot_

 so they got into sub prime mortgages and we should feel sorry for them and let the taxpayers bail them out now _meta_end_dot_

 in real person speak tim mahoney now wants taxpayers to pay for their homeownership because you know living beyond your means is as american as apple pie _meta_end_dot_
