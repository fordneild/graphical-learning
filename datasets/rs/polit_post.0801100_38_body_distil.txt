 i know people hold ronald reagan in rather high esteem _meta_end_dot_

 but i have never in my life witnessed the sort of zealotry that attaches some to ron paul _meta_end_dot_

 can anyone explain this to me _meta_end_question_

 just let s leave that be for a moment _meta_end_dot_

 can ron paul s defenders please justify voting for a man who appears based on the evidence to be mentally unstable and haunted by a livable and low grade but quite real case of paranoid schizophrenia _meta_end_question_

 why are such florid hallucinations suddenly sensible when they come from ron ahem doctor paul _meta_end_question_
