  robert mugabe and his aides are evidently telling the opposition that mugabe will resign if he does not face prosecution in the aftermath of any resignation _meta_end_dot_

 otherwise mugabe may allow his term to lapse and then extend his rule by emergency decree _meta_end_dot_

 again it should surprise no one that mugabe is doing this _meta_end_dot_

 but the fact that he is doing it is nothing short of completely appalling _meta_end_dot_

 zimbabwe had better be prepared to be held hostage for at least a little while longer _meta_end_dot_
