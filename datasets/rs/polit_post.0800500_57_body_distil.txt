  byron york learned today mitt romney has spent nearly _meta_dollor_ref_m on wmur the main new hampshire tv station _meta_end_dot_

 by contrast that is slightly more than hillary clinton and barack obama combined _meta_end_dot_

 more than the entire gop field combined outspending his nearest opponent john mccain nearly _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 i am in new hampshire right now _meta_end_dot_

 in _meta_number_ref_ days i have seen exactly _meta_number_ref_ positive ads by romney and about _meta_number_ref_ negative _meta_end_dot_

 just saying _meta_end_dot_
