  much has been written about the firing of bob malley by barack obama s campaign _meta_end_dot_

 commentary s jen rubin asks one of the most important questions _meta_end_dot_

 what do obama s statements on iran and the palestinian question have to do with expressions of support _meta_end_question_

 today s washington times quoting a hamas official an israeli legislator sees something quite concrete in this redrawing an la times story entitled allies of palestinians see a friend in barack obama the lat story describes the evening and obama s toast to khalidi a negotiator for the palestinians in the oslo accords and a fundraiser for barack obama in _meta_number_ref_ now i am not arguing that obama will work with the iranians or their agents hamas and hezbollah _meta_end_dot_

 but when president obama enters office on a promise to withdraw from iraq iran advancing directly and through its proxies in the region and a new president who is understood as uniquely open to a palestinian perspective how will that be viewed in the region _meta_end_question_

 who will have won _meta_end_question_

 perhaps the iranians are just thinking ahead _meta_end_question_
