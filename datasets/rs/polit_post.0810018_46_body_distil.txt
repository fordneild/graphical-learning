  general petraeus testified before the senate yesterday _meta_end_dot_

 ambassador crocker testified as well _meta_end_dot_

 the major headlines seemed more interested in the presidential nominees and how they in turn handled their couple of minutes before the cameras questioning these two men about the status of things in iraq _meta_end_dot_

 much excitement swirled among the major media outlets opining about how commander in chiefish they might have performed _meta_end_dot_

 little was offered on the specifics of the news that the general and ambassador s testimony brought us about the single most divisive issue in modern american history well since viet nam at least _meta_end_dot_

 i watched it all on cspan _meta_number_ref_ but since i don t get cspan _meta_number_ref_ i missed the foreign relations circus in the afternoon _meta_end_dot_

 i was lucky though because obama s network cnn promised all afternoon they would interrupt anyone that might be discussing the day s news when obama got his turn to demagogue _meta_end_dot_

 they did he did and i remain unimpressed _meta_end_dot_

 this is about iraq _meta_end_dot_

 it s about afghanistan _meta_end_dot_

 it s about the middle east _meta_end_dot_

 it s about terrorism and the long war _meta_end_dot_

 it s about sunni and shia and wahabi _meta_end_dot_

 it s about christians and jews and muslims _meta_end_dot_

 it s about oil _meta_end_dot_

 it s about our middle and long term security interests _meta_end_dot_

 it s about our grandchildren and the grandchildren of arabs and persians and israelis _meta_end_dot_

 it s about everyone else s grandchildren as well _meta_end_dot_

 it s about things that are hard and complicated _meta_end_dot_

 increasingly however it s becoming more about making it go away by turning our backs on these issues hoping they ll get better on their own some even believing they will only get better by turning our backs on them hard and complicated don t go very well in modern america anymore _meta_end_dot_

 it should not be about who the next president is _meta_end_dot_

 clearly however i am in the minority in this regard _meta_end_dot_

 america still stands at the very same crossroad it has been made to suffer for a very tiresomely long time now do we stay or do we go _meta_end_question_

 this is going to be a long one so if you leave now leave with something my good friend jeff emanuel said way back in october of _meta_number_ref_ it s stunning what you might learn should you join the men and women doing the heavy lifting as opposed to jumping in for a quick photo op and running home for another dull day on capitol hill _meta_end_dot_

 more below the fold _meta_end_dot_

 the news brought to us from petraeus and crocker held a recurring theme iraq is hard and it is complicated _meta_end_dot_

 it s better but it could get worse again _meta_end_dot_

 progress in areas of security and political reconciliation has been made it s fragile and it is reversible but as crocker put it almost everything about iraq is difficult but hard does not mean hopeless and the political and economic process of the past few months is significant petraeus stated that there is no turning of a corner no light at the end of the tunnel adding that the champagne bottle has been pushed to the back of the refrigerator this is important stuff folks and requires a little more thought than the _meta_number_ref_ second sound bites we re getting from the potus wannabes more concerned with votes than with the correct way forward with america s future _meta_end_dot_

 it is fair to say in hindsight iraq should not have been entered into _meta_end_dot_

 i suggest as much not because it was the right thing or the wrong thing strategically but because we couldn t have known the extent to which it would be politicized and demagogued and used as a riot baton over the heads of the american people _meta_end_dot_

 it is also fair to say given what we knew at the time what we believed to be true about weapons of mass destruction rape rooms torture the human indecency in nearly everything saddam had done to his country and his people made liberating iraq seem the right thing to do _meta_end_dot_

 so too is it fair to say that many things were handled poorly _meta_end_dot_

 state and defense have bungled many things with long lasting repercussions for the very people we want ed so badly to help _meta_end_dot_

 reconstruction has been good in places and bad in others _meta_end_dot_

 security has improved in places and stayed bad or worsened in others _meta_end_dot_

 some iraqis like us and some hate us _meta_end_dot_

 neighbors from syria to iran to lebanon who knows maybe even palestine and jordan and egypt and saudi arabia for all any of us know have gone to great lengths to fight for american failure in iraq _meta_end_dot_

 each in turn has very specific and unique reasons for wanting a bad outcome for the west in iraq and given we invaded an arab neighbor perhaps they are justified however much worse they might be making things for themselves in the years ahead _meta_end_dot_

 we can all agree that iraq has torn not only the middle east into little pieces but it has torn america into little pieces as well _meta_end_dot_

 that is surely not what the planners intended reasonable men and women re emphasizing reasonable can agree to that _meta_end_dot_

 but the reality remains we are in iraq and there is much to be done _meta_end_dot_

 what remains to be decided is who exactly is going to see to it that these things are accomplished _meta_end_question_

 potus hopeful barack obama suggests we initiate and called for more pressure on the iraqi government to embrace political reconciliation and a regional diplomatic surge that includes iran adding that w e should be talking to them as well obama s ideas with respect to iran sound nice on paper but ignoring iran s stated intentions with israel their presumed hostile intentions with nuclear weapons and their willingness to apply pressure where they know it hurts us most any negotiations with iran can be considered suspect on their face and the results of such negotiations can not be believed beyond arm s length _meta_end_dot_

 a lengthy history exists regarding iran s refusal to comply with the international community hedging their bets on america s defeat in iraq only further supports them lying to our faces for their presumed longer term gains _meta_end_dot_

 but in his youthful statesmanship and ideas on matters of foreign affairs read naivete obama continues negotiating with a known state sponsor of terrorism a trainer and supplier and financier of militias and terrorists by offering them a time certain for american presence to be removed from the iraq theater doesn t appear to be the best first bargaining chip for squelching iran s apparent desire to run the show in the region and fill the vacuum we would leave behind after what obama promises would not be a precipitous withdrawal _meta_end_dot_

 i m not certain mr _meta_end_dot_

 obama sees the long term implications of handing the region over to iran in time for them to nuke israel or anyone else they think stands in their way of re establishing the caliphate before we or any of our allies can actually do anything about it _meta_end_dot_

 potus wannabe hillary clinton with disdain in her heart has a slightly different approach with the same end game in mind _meta_end_dot_

 while she too suggests leaving iraq is the best way to force iraqis to finish the hard work left to be done she needs to associate everything with a failed administration as the driving force to justify the strategy she was also quoted again with this recurring campaign message failed policy or obama s massive strategic blunder rhetoric resonates with pols and pundits but they aren t specific alternative strategies for iraqis to attach themselves to as they hope to live to see the next day or week or grandchild _meta_end_dot_

 obama gets the win for being motivated by positive factors _meta_end_dot_

 his heart s in the right place _meta_end_dot_

 mrs _meta_end_dot_

 clinton on the other hand is driven by wanting to be president herself because she s so mad at the one we have in office just now _meta_end_dot_

 while clinton goes down swinging with it s all bush s fault let s punish him by wiping clean the past _meta_number_ref_ years of history with a black mark on his president bush s back there s no there there in what she thinks makes the most sense for the future of iraq _meta_end_dot_

 neither of them have this right in my opinion but they have votes to worry about _meta_end_dot_

 sadly this is no way for a true statesman to behave _meta_end_dot_

 like obama s hope and change theme hillary s solutions initiatives fall short on all accounts for providing us with the answer to the fundamental question what do we do now _meta_end_question_

 as gideon_meta_number_ref_ tries to highlight in paraphrasing a summation of the anti war position leaving a place before the work is finished believing it will accelerate progress toward completion just falls short of logical thought he s got it right in reminding us that this takes time _meta_end_dot_

 removing the primary security force from a theater of operations where security is still tenuous at best will kill innocent civilians and will kill military and support personnel as well _meta_end_dot_

 displacing our forces with iraqi forces is the plan and has worked with some modicum of success in certain areas _meta_end_dot_

 but not in all areas _meta_end_dot_

 political progress is as much reliant on security as it is on those doing the politicking _meta_end_dot_

 vilifying maliki is easy business but critique from a governing body equally incapable of making the tough choices or giving in to the necessary compromises is disingenuous and laughable on its face _meta_end_dot_

 this congress enjoys its approval rating for a very good reason and holding iraq a couple years old to a higher standard than it sets for itself a couple hundred years old is beyond the pale _meta_end_dot_

 the way forward in iraq over the long term does include our significantly reduced armed presence _meta_end_dot_

 the conditions however for those reductions must be conditions based not time based as the two democrat contenders would have us believe _meta_end_dot_

 the suggested diplomatic surge is very wise catchy too if you re running for president on zero experience but doesn t include the right players _meta_end_dot_

 as with the dprk a combination of sanctions and isolation and a multi lateral team of countries all of iraq and iran s neighbors needs to be brought to bear on iran and her fellow opportunists negotiating from a vantage point of being apologetic for doing what you believe to be the right thing is no way to assert your strength of position to strongly encourage bad guys to become good guys _meta_end_dot_

 along the way iraq will still need sustained security and she still needs her own people to continue the painfully slow task of assuming first contact responsibility _meta_end_dot_

 until the government and their security forces can do this we re going to have to continue to do it for them _meta_end_dot_

 no one else can and no one else will _meta_end_dot_

 however much we would like our men and women home iraq is not ready for them to leave _meta_end_dot_

 where our political heroes here at home can help the most is where they refuse to help at all agreeing amongst themselves to demand victory insisting on success providing the physical and financial resources necessary and mustering the necessary political will to pressure the countries surrounding iraq to get on board with helping her to succeed _meta_end_dot_

 these sadly are the very things congress continues to refuse to do _meta_end_dot_

 it s too hard and it s too complicated you see _meta_end_dot_

 instead they remain focused on insisting we remove iraq from the us government teat because there are a great many americans read potential voters that they want to put on that teat in the name of accruing power for its own sake _meta_end_dot_

 that is no way to run a country and it is certainly no way to fight a war _meta_end_dot_

 in the end jeff is still right _meta_number_ref_ months hence it has fallen victim to paralysis and this continues to fatally undermine iraq and everyone s efforts there _meta_end_dot_
