  how do we know that things have gotten significantly better in iraq _meta_end_question_

 perhaps because of stories like this one but at the same time it is important to note that there has been a significant and fundamental change in the narrative concerning iraq _meta_end_dot_

 what was once seen as unwinnable is now palpably within reach in terms of reconstituting the country and helping to turn it into a middle east success story _meta_end_dot_

 and the political dynamics here at home reflect this new reality _meta_end_dot_

 if things continue to go down the current positive path it will seriously upset the conventional wisdom that has the democrats winning the white house in _meta_number_ref_ thanks to public dissatisfaction with iraq _meta_end_dot_

 and while democratic candidates may strive to distance themselves from their previously resolute antiwar positions we have the internet to remind us of what they said and how often they called the surge a failure and denigrated any and all improvements in iraq as being ephemeral _meta_end_dot_

 by their judgments and predictions on this issue we shall know them _meta_end_dot_
