  i would warm up to mitt romney s candidacy a lot more if he would simply say on the campaign trail what so many people are rightfully pointing out romneycare does not work read on _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 so to recap mandatory health insurance has turned out to be anything but _meta_end_dot_

 people are being encouraged to sign up for state subsidized insurance instead thus placing additional burdens on massachusetts s budget _meta_end_dot_

 and the costs are out of control read the whole thing which will depress you further by reminding you that the democratic candidates plan to use romneycare as a template with which to achieve universal health insurance _meta_end_dot_

 then tell me how this is different from the current health care crisis that we are confronting _meta_end_dot_

 i am really glad about how i cast my lot on the health insurance debate _meta_end_dot_

 my decision looks better and better all the time _meta_end_dot_

 i truly wish that more people would decide similarly _meta_end_dot_
