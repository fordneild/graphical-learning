  this has been a hard work week for me _meta_end_dot_

 i ve missed much of the news and i ve missed blogging all week _meta_end_dot_

 nothing cools me back down and brings me back to the blogs like making fun of the obama campaign _meta_end_dot_

 they re so ripe for it _meta_end_exclamation_

 last week i did an open thread featuring obama videos _meta_end_dot_

 this week it s graphics _meta_end_dot_

 lets see your funniest or creepiest obama pics graphics posters and paraphernalia _meta_end_dot_

 i ll start off with _meta_number_ref_ posters _meta_end_dot_

 four that i made and one really creepy one you ve probably seen before _meta_end_dot_

 the one to the right is one i just made _meta_end_dot_

 i think the content is self explanatory _meta_end_dot_
