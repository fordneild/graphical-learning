  tomorrow general david petraeus will be testifying before the house armed services committee on the coalition s progress in stabilizing and rebuilding iraq combating sectarian violence and fighting terrorist groups like al qaeda _meta_end_dot_

 as a member of this committee i had the opportunity to witness general david petraeus s initial testimony on the subject last september _meta_end_dot_

 in his testimony general petraeus provided vital information about the coalition s progress in iraq and about the war effort as a whole _meta_end_dot_

 however vicious false and sensationalist attacks by moveon org and the new york times managed to take a great deal of the focus off of general petraeus s crucial report _meta_end_dot_

 as you all remember these brutal assaults on general petraeus s character and honor included an offensive and downright false newspaper advertisement portraying this brilliant leader and american hero as a liar and a traitor to his country _meta_end_dot_

 i know that i speak for the vast majority of americans when i say that i was appalled by these anti american actions _meta_end_dot_

 even more even than this i was disgusted by the failure of many of my democrat colleagues to condemn these malicious attacks _meta_end_dot_

 at the time in fact many democrat member of congress echoed moveon org and the new york times in their public testimony even questioning this american hero s integrity and the same thing is happening now _meta_end_dot_

 please read on _meta_end_dot_

 this week general petraeus is once again appearing before congress to provide a progress report on our mission in iraq _meta_end_dot_

 just as before anti military groups like moveon org and code pink are protesting and are further attempting to vilify this leader distracting us from his message of progress and hope in a country that has seen far too little of both for several decades _meta_end_dot_

 i would like to help counter these attacks by presenting the general when he arrives to testify before my committee tomorrow with a petition that includes signatures and comments from citizens who support both our efforts in iraq and the men and women in uniform who are currently making incredible sacrifices for the sake of peace and victory _meta_end_dot_

 anti war activists have the right to speak out and we do not seek to use the power of government to silence them however wrongheaded and false their actions and statements might be _meta_end_dot_

 instead we must show solidarity with the members of our heroic military and we must work together to make our message of hope and support louder and stronger than the voice of the radical anti war groups _meta_end_dot_

 we must make clear that our military s efforts in executing general petraeus s successful strategy have not gone unnoticed _meta_end_dot_

 we must join together in affirming our collective belief that precipitous withdrawal and retreat would be a disastrous blow to our national security and that abandoning the iraqi people and leaving them at the mercy of brutal and violent islamic jihadists would be the height of inhumanity _meta_end_dot_

 please visit my web site and sign the petition so that we can show general petraeus and all of our heroes in uniform that we support them and their courageous fight for the future of iraq and the safety of our great nation _meta_end_dot_

 thank you for your help your support and your patriotism _meta_end_dot_
