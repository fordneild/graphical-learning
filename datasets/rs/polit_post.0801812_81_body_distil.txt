  yesterday the american civil liberties union of ohio yes the same one that sued the state over its choose life license plates citing viewpoint discrimination against pro choicers filed a lawsuit to prevent cuyahoga county the state s largest county and home to cleveland and its surrounding communities from switching its voting apparati from touch screen machines to what the aclu believes represents unequal inaccurate and inadequate voting technology the new method of voting which the aclu one of the most professionally offended organizations in the nation finds so well offensive _meta_end_question_

 the paper ballot _meta_end_dot_

 cuyahoga county is switching to paper ballots for the state s primary election on march _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 according to the cleveland plain dealer said we take no position on what kind of voting technology is used so long as voters have the chance to check their ballots for mistakes before casting their vote read on _meta_end_dot_

 not that it s a surprise to anybody here but the aclu of course has a history caring very much what kind of voting technology is used or more precisely of believing that pretty much every method of voting is guilty of being either disenfranchising or unconstitutional back during the california recall election of _meta_number_ref_ for example the aclus of northern and southern california filed suits against voting machines demanding an election postponement on the grounds that the machines would lead to widespread disenfranchisement of voters even the cuyahoga county case is not without its ironies _meta_end_dot_

 the switch to paper ballots is being made at the behest of democrat secretary of state jennifer brunner who authorized a study last year that helped her conclude touch screen voting can be manipulated you know the diebold steals elections kind of manipulated well as can easily happen when a professionally offended organization gets involved yet again in an election dispute the aclu finds itself between a rock and a hard place here _meta_end_dot_

 you see in suing to prevent cuyahoga county from changing to the unconstitutional paper ballot the aclu currently finds itself in the unenviable position of suing to prevent a switch from a method of voting touch screen that it has sued in florida to have eliminated in the past on the grounds that you guessed it touch screen voting machines violate the integrity of the voting process it s an unenviable position for anybody to be in but when an organization takes offense at pretty much everything on behalf of pretty much everybody there are bound to be some contradictory positions that come up _meta_end_dot_

 it s awfully nice of the aclu to ignore those contradictions and to keep on fighting against pretty much everything as though they were being consistent and actually doing some good don tcha think _meta_end_question_

 by the way just a personal note to the aclu of ohio if the beef with the paper ballot system is that voters need to have the opportunity to identify and fix errors on their ballots why don t you just remind everybody to check their work before officially submitting their ballot _meta_end_question_

 it s not that hard i promise and all of those voters who went to school past the first grade should be used to doing so as at least where i went to school every test they ve ever turned in has been counted as submitted with no post submission opportunity to recheck and correct their selected answers _meta_end_dot_

 and let s get down to the bottom line here regardless of the absurd and contradictory nature of this case if somebody can t be bothered to check their work on the paper representation of their sacred franchise before submitting that vote then do they really have any business voting for their and our leaders anyway _meta_end_question_

 i don t really think so _meta_end_dot_
