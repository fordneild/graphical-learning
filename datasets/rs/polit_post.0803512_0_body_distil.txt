  one of the reasons why i am a member of the anti universal coverage club is summed up by the manifesto of the club she has announced the most draconian of measures to finance her plans for universal coverage read on _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 so now clinton won t even bother with proposing to raise taxes _meta_end_dot_

 instead she will impose mandatory wage garnishment in order to finance her plan _meta_end_dot_

 and she will do this instead of following the anti universal coverage club s recommendation that if governments must subsidize those who cannot afford medical care they should be free to experiment with different types of subsidies cash vouchers insurance public clinics hospitals uncompensated care payments etc and tax exemptions rather than be forced by a policy of universal coverage to subsidize people via insurance there is no pretense anymore concerning respecting the notion that what you earn as part of your paycheck should be respected as yours to the greatest extent possible _meta_end_dot_

 no _meta_end_dot_

 now instead if you make too much money under a new clinton administration you will see your taxes raised because a new clinton administration will prevent the bush tax cuts from becoming permanent and you will see your wages garnished because a new clinton administration wants to force you into purchasing health care instead of working to find the kind of free market solutions that the anti universal coverage club helpfully puts forth _meta_end_dot_

 for everyone who still believes that there are no major differences between the republican and democratic presidential candidates this post is for you _meta_end_dot_

 i recognize that republican voters may be dissatisfied with either mccain or romney _meta_end_dot_

 but at the very least they wouldn t try an appalling authoritarian stunt like wage garnishment to finance their social experimentation policies _meta_end_dot_
