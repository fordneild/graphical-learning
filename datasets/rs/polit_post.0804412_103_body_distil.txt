  ok with mccain stuffing the huck insurgency back in the bottle again yesterday it s time to start thinking general election strategy _meta_end_dot_

 now we know the basics of what john mccain needs to do to beat hillary clinton which is mostly based on _meta_number_ref_ reminding voters that she is hillary clinton and _meta_number_ref_ letting voters get prolonged exposure to watching and listening to hillary clinton _meta_end_dot_

 but barack obama if he manages to keep his back free of clinton shivs long enough to secure the nomination will be a more challenging nut to crack he has far lower built in negatives and is surrounded by a protective heat shield of worshipful press coverage _meta_end_dot_

 he s unlike the unlikeable and fundamentally disingenuous candidates the democrats ran in _meta_number_ref_ and _meta_number_ref_ and much more similar to the candidates they ran in _meta_number_ref_ and _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 that last analogy suggests why obama strong as he is on the surface should not be confused with an unbeatable candidate _meta_end_dot_

 anyway i ll start with one specific issue that i think needs not to be overplayed in a campaign against obama pork barrel spending and earmarks _meta_end_dot_

 yes it s a hot issue and a worthy one _meta_end_dot_

 yes it contributed to the air of fiscal irresponsibility and corruption that fed the gop s defeat in _meta_number_ref_ and from which mccain needs to distance himself _meta_end_dot_

 yes it s important to mccain s good government spending hawk brand is an issue he attacks with genuine enthusiasm and helps serve as a firewall against the charge that mccain s superior experience is a liability because he doesn t represent abstract nouns like a man who just got to washington in _meta_number_ref_ and hasn t even located the big spigot where the taxpayer money flows from yet _meta_end_dot_

 but for all of that if sen _meta_end_dot_

 obama is the nominee i hope sen _meta_end_dot_

 mccain is clued in early to the fact that this issue is not going to be a useful distinction against obama for three reasons _meta_end_dot_

 read on _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 people like obama and think he embodies change from business as usual _meta_end_dot_

 trying to change that perception is going to be harder work than it s worth _meta_end_dot_

 you beat a guy like obama by burrowing into his fundamental naivete extremism and inexperience by showing how his combination of extreme liberalism and lack of experience leads him to be very wrong on the very biggest of the big things and to take extremist positions on cultural signifier issues _meta_end_dot_

 small bore goo goo issues won t do that _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 one of obama s very few actual accomplishments in dc was co sponsoring the porkbusters bill on earmark disclosures with tom coburn _meta_end_dot_

 granted coburn did all the heavy lifting but obama will get deservedly some credit for putting himself out there on the issue and reaching across the aisle _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 mccain s been in dc so long and obama so little time that it will be much easier to find examples of projects mccain himself has brought home than obama _meta_end_dot_

 that s not to say that obama has no weaknesses in this area one can certainly point to letters obama wrote as a state senator in support of a _meta_dollor_ref_ million taxpayer funded housing project that yielded more than _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ in fees for now indicted obama fundraiser tony rezko _meta_end_dot_

 but while mccain has fought the good fight against some of congress most ridiculous wastes of money he has never himself been entirely immune to bringing home what arizona voters wanted _meta_end_dot_

 mccain will talk about pork and earmarks in his stump speech as i noted above it s part of his appeal _meta_end_dot_

 but those of us who remember his _meta_number_ref_ primary campaign and other races like rick lazio s _meta_number_ref_ senate race which was run by the same people know that process issues can grease a candidate s good press but they don t win elections the big things do the things that go to people s basic hopes fears needs and values _meta_end_dot_

 let s hope sen _meta_end_dot_

 mccain keeps that in mind in focusing his priorities _meta_end_dot_

 the remarks ben notes from last night are thematically a good start _meta_end_dot_
