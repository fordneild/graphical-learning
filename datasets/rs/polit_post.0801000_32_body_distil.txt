  i suppose that it might be possible that the clinton campaign somehow knew that it would win in new hampshire despite all of the polls and all of the momentum going barack obama s way _meta_end_dot_

 perhaps the campaign allowed others to set expectations for obama and was able to triumph not only by winning the vote in new hampshire but also by seeing those expectations upset _meta_end_dot_

 i have a hard time believing that _meta_end_dot_

 i think the clinton campaign was happily caught off guard _meta_end_dot_

 chances are that there was a dramatic polling error the nature of which is yet to be determined _meta_end_dot_

 in any event i don t think that what happened yesterday was the result of any clintonian spinning _meta_end_dot_

 the victory in new hampshire notwithstanding the clinton campaign revealed that it has a jutting glass jaw just asking for a punch _meta_end_dot_

 it is resourceful and tough but by no means is it ten feet tall _meta_end_dot_

 and i really don t care if hillary clinton said that she found her voice she is not good on the stump and she will lose her voice again as a consequence _meta_end_dot_
