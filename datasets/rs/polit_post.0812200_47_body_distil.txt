  factcheck org has the details _meta_end_dot_

 we are seeing an awful lot of incidents in which mccain s words are twisted aren t we _meta_end_question_

 and here i thought that team reality to use the term popularized by tom maguire was above that sort of thing _meta_end_dot_

 meanwhile andrew sullivan never missing a chance to lobby aggressively for barack obama tells us that if jeremiah wright s words are to be the basis on which this election is decided then john mccain s words count too no one said otherwise _meta_end_dot_

 of course this is entirely beside the point as well _meta_end_dot_

 the issue isn t words counting rather the issue is having statements reported and quoted correctly accurately and in context _meta_end_dot_
