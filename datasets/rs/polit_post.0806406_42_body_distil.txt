  i seem to recall that there was a great big hue and cry about the supposed denigration of military service back in the last election _meta_end_dot_

 to be sure i don t think that anyone s service ought to be denigrated and i remember not paying much if any attention to the case of swift boat veterans v _meta_end_dot_

 john kerry _meta_end_dot_

 but if that was the traveshamockery everyone and their pet canaries say it was then what to make of this _meta_end_question_

 john mccain of course not only served in uniform but has taken an active role in military and national security policy throughout his congressional career and is the ranking member on the senate armed services committee _meta_end_dot_

 if republicans were in the majority he would be the chairman _meta_end_dot_

 to say that he is not prepared for the role of commander in chief or that he is less prepared than hillary clinton is just laughably ridiculous _meta_end_dot_

 will we hear a renewed hue and cry over swiftboating _meta_end_question_

 or will there be a great big yawning silence _meta_end_question_

 i await a pleasant surprise that entails having people on all sides of the political spectrum denounce this attack on mccain but i have little hope that this scenario will play itself out _meta_end_dot_

 call it a hunch _meta_end_dot_

 and call me a cynic _meta_end_dot_
