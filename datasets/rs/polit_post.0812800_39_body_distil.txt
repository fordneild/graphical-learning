  granted paul krugman is a hillary supporter but it looks clear to me that obama s campaign dishonestly used a quote in krugman s op ed as it relates to the federal gas tax _meta_end_dot_

 michael dobbs has an excerpt of the ad _meta_end_dot_

 to be fair he says that both campaigns have been stretching the facts on this issue _meta_end_dot_

 i ve come to expect fact stretching from the clintons because it s been a common occurrence ever since _meta_number_ref_ when bill clinton trotted out the lie that we had the worst economy in fifty years _meta_end_dot_

 but obama on the other hand promised a new kind of politics but i guess untruths weren t included in that pledge _meta_end_dot_

 here s the ad more below the fold _meta_end_dot_

 here s what dobbs said krugman s blog didn t say that clinton s plan would boost oil industry profits _meta_end_dot_

 rather it would be in one pocket out the other for oil companies implying revenue or profit neutrality _meta_end_dot_

 here s what krugman said about the ad the obama people do indeed suggest otherwise _meta_end_dot_

 it was a clever tactic by the obama campaign using a hillary supporter s quotes to undermine hillary _meta_end_dot_

 too bad the quote was dishonestly applied _meta_end_dot_

 i ve asked this before and i ll keep asking it why is obama getting away with all these untruths _meta_end_question_

 for those of you keeping score at home on the untruths there is this then this then this then this this then this then this and then this _meta_end_dot_

 yow _meta_end_dot_
