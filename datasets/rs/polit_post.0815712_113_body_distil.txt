  i ve covered the haditha events fairly extensively since they first broke here here here including an interview with the the defense team of ltc jeffrey chessani _meta_end_dot_

 as a career army officer i have to admit that my faith in the military justice system has been both shaken and bolstered by what has happened thus far _meta_end_dot_

 but first the news _meta_end_dot_

 read on _meta_end_dot_

 the top story is that the first marine to be court martialed in conjunction with the alleged massacre at haditha was acquitted _meta_end_dot_

 this leaves two more marines facing trial over the incident ltc jeffrey chessani and ssg frank wuterich _meta_end_dot_

 of the eight marines originally charged in the incident six have now been exonerated _meta_end_dot_

 from the beginning politics have played role exceeding that of the administration of justice _meta_end_dot_

 it is at least arguable both murtha and the la times having done so that the source for jack murtha s characterization of the actions at haditha as cold blooded murder was none other than commandant of the marine corps _meta_end_dot_

 the more this orwellian nightmare persists the more it becomes apparent that these marines have been offered up as a latter day human sacrifice to appease angry political gods _meta_end_dot_

 for instance witness the thin gruel charged against lt grayson _meta_end_dot_

 he was charged with obstruction of justice for ordering the deletion of digital photos when regulations required their deletion of photos of dead iraqis if they had no intelligence value and when he did not know that haditha was under investigation _meta_end_dot_

 he was charged with improperly separating from the marines even though he was advised by his military attorney and his commander that there was no reason he could not discharged _meta_end_dot_

 the case against ltc chessani has hit a snag which might very well result in the dismissal of all charges _meta_end_dot_

 the defense team alleged that unlawful command influence had permeated the case _meta_end_dot_

 the military judge agreed that there was sufficient evidence of such influence that he has directed a hearing on the matter _meta_end_dot_

 this has led to the unprecedent action of a marine four star general being hauled into court to explain why his actions have not perverted the course of justice _meta_end_dot_

 as i ve written much earlier i ve no sympathy for war crimes _meta_end_dot_

 i don t think any soldier does _meta_end_dot_

 but at the same time young men and women on the sharp end of our nation s spear deserve much better that being second guessed at leisure by people who weren t there _meta_end_dot_

 and if they are going to be second guessed they deserve a chain of command who will at least give them a fair hearing _meta_end_dot_

 sadly the marines have failed in much of this _meta_end_dot_

 arguably there is reason to bring ssg wuterich to trial _meta_end_dot_

 he lead the rifle squad which did most of the fighting _meta_end_dot_

 ltc chessani did nothing more or less than every officer in his chain of command _meta_end_dot_

 if he goes on trial his regimental and divisional commanders should be at the defendant s table with him _meta_end_dot_

 even as we re seeing that individual investigating officers jurors defense attorneys and military judges are not willing to kowtow to political exigency the next act is waiting to come on stage _meta_end_dot_

 when ltc chessani and ssg wuterich are eventually and rightfully exonerated notwithstanding that their careers will have been ruined and their reputations permanently sullied there will be a hue and cry to bring these allegations under the purview of federal grand juries and federal courts _meta_end_dot_

 a forum that would provide immediate gratification to any ambitious prosecutor and place the freedom of our men and women in uniform in the hands of people who cannot possibly understand the situation and who are quite possibly hostile to them in principle _meta_end_dot_
