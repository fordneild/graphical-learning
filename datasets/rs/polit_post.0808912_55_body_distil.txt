  the continuation of this reverend wright story further demonstrates the fraud that is barackobama _meta_end_dot_

 let s work the timeline on this _meta_end_dot_

 barackobama claims that he would have left the church in _meta_number_ref_ if wright had not stepped down as an active pastor _meta_end_dot_

 note that he is still senior pastor and all sermons in the church bulletin are copyright to wright _meta_end_dot_

 of course in _meta_number_ref_ barackobama gave his largest donation to the church ever _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ which is probably on par with the annual salary of many of his followers _meta_end_dot_

 that s twenty two thousand five hundred demonstrations of his support for the message and work of rev _meta_end_dot_

 wright coming at a time when barackobama would have us believe that he was struggling with wright s words and leadership _meta_end_dot_

 of course you will recall that when the wright story first broke barackobama simply hadn t heard about these sermons _meta_end_dot_

 they didn t happen when he was there he d never been told about them and he simply had no clue about the statements and beliefs being made and held by his spiritual mentor even as he took his young girls week after week to hear wright s sermons _meta_end_dot_

 of course as absentee pointed out on the front page last night it was wright s racial and racist message that so appealed to barackobama in the first place drawing him in to the trinity fold so many years ago _meta_end_dot_

 once that fell through he attempted to use wright and trinity as a wedge issue telling white ameri kkk a that we simply don t understand why this is a perfectly acceptable way to view and speak about the country that has given its citizens more opportunity than any in history _meta_end_dot_

 of course he didn t say that it was perfectly acceptable in so many words instead he danced around the issue saying he couldn t disown rev _meta_end_dot_

 wright when that was not what he was asked to do anyway and telling white america that it is in essence genetically incapable of getting the racial struggle that broils below the surface of this nation continuously stoked by race warlords like al sharpton jesse jackson louis farrakhan and jeremiah wright _meta_end_dot_

 back to obama s repeated attempts to spin this way and that and to distance himself from wright without actually doing so _meta_end_dot_

 what is going on here is quite simple barackobama is lying _meta_end_dot_

 in fact he is to use a technical term lying his freaking pants off _meta_end_dot_

 his lies on this topic have morphed into an extremely convenient form as well _meta_end_dot_

 now that his actions have been exposed as being opposite of what he first claimed barackobama has shifted gears and is lying about his state of mind something that it is very difficult to disprove or to corroborate _meta_end_dot_

 unfortunately for barackobama his actions are speaking far louder than his largely empty words and he is being exposed as a fraud on more fronts than he has the means to defend _meta_end_dot_

 jeremiah wright whose message he chose to hear to take his family to hear and to support with amounts of his own money that would make blue collar americans like those who make up his supporters turn green with envy is one issue that will continue to haunt him throughout this campaign and rightly so as barackobama seems entirely unable to drop the fa ade and actually tell the truth about his own view dealings beliefs and attendance _meta_end_dot_
