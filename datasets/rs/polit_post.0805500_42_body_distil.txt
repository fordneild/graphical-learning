  precisely three years and one day ago the supreme court entertained oral arguments in kelo v _meta_end_dot_

 city of new london _meta_end_dot_

 and alas the court s decision in kelo was lamentable despite the manifest and overwhelming evidence concerning the degree of eminent domain abuse that goes on in the united states _meta_end_dot_

 one aspect of that abuse concerns the designation of urban blight that leads to the exercise of eminent domain powers _meta_end_dot_

 as i pointed out here while land value can at times be depressed a depression in value does should not automatically lead to the conclusion that land is blighted and yet far too often that is exactly what happens _meta_end_dot_

 it happened in kelo and led to the exercise of eminent domain powers in that case _meta_end_dot_

 one would think that the overuse of the blight designation was bad enough and a sufficiently fearsome impediment to the belief that a person s home is his or her castle _meta_end_dot_

 but there is something else to worry about as well _meta_end_dot_

 as ilya somin points out blight designations are like cockroaches _meta_end_dot_

 you just can t kill them off _meta_end_dot_

 and efforts to do so only serve to raise the hackles of land planning bureaucrats who believe that the power to condemn a particular piece of land ought to be timeless _meta_end_dot_

 as such they resist legislative efforts to set deadlines of as long as forty years for blight redevelopment plans to be implemented _meta_end_dot_

 it s ironic really _meta_end_dot_

 blight is a term that is utterly abused as a means of condemning land for planning and profit at the expense of business owners and home owners whose presence is inconvenient to the bureaucrats in love with eminent domain abuse _meta_end_dot_

 but strangely enough few people appear to be willing to talk and write about the blight on the takings clause of the constitution that comes from eminent domain abuse _meta_end_dot_

 i hear there is a presidential election this year _meta_end_dot_

 any chance that a voice or two from on high could be raised about this issue _meta_end_question_

 if the constitution really is worth defending and i certainly believe that it is then there is no excuse to keep silent any longer _meta_end_dot_
