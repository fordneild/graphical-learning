 erick cross posted on right michigan at www rightmichigan com _meta_end_dot_

 it wouldn t be a new semester if central michigan university weren t attempting to censor free speech and political thought on campus _meta_end_dot_

 wait that s not entirely true _meta_end_dot_

 they don t have a problem with free speech and political thought from the left _meta_end_dot_

 it s just the conservatives they have a problem with _meta_end_dot_

 by now we all know the story of dennis lennox _meta_end_dot_

 there s not much i can add that hasn t been more eloquently stated by mike volpe and chet zarko in recent days _meta_end_dot_

 the kid has almost single handedly raised the gary peters issue to national prominence _meta_end_dot_

 but just because dennis thinks that peters should choose between campus and congress in a district hundreds of miles away while violating federal campaign laws that prohibit public employees from pursuing office doesn t mean the nut job administrators at central agree with him _meta_end_dot_

 quite the contrary _meta_end_dot_

 they re waging a very personal war against an outspoken conservative student because he dares have opinions different from theirs _meta_end_dot_

 the school has targeted lennox by banning videotaping ignored a dean who assaulted him directed faculty and staff to avoid the use of cmu e mail when discussing gary peters because it could be released under foia accused the kid of suffering from mental illness because he holds conservative political views and has an interesting haircut _meta_end_dot_

 they went as far as to call him the next virginia tech style school shooter _meta_end_dot_

 and that was all them playing nice _meta_end_dot_

 well they ve decided to take the gloves off and we re going to have to do the same _meta_end_dot_

 one week from today on january _meta_number_ref_th at _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ am the school will be holding an expulsion hearing to try to rid themselves of lennox once and for all _meta_end_dot_

 nevermind that the aclu elected officials and alumni have the kids back he s making things difficult for the lefties in power on campus and they want to wash their hands of him _meta_end_dot_

 even more sinister they re only now letting the guy see the evidence they have against him and have refused his request to record the session determined to cloak it permanently in secrecy _meta_end_dot_

 remember the good old days when having anti establishment viewpoints and rallying against the man was part of the college experience _meta_end_question_

 students on the left have rioted thrown rocks at police and destroyed property and avoided serious trouble from campus officials _meta_end_dot_

 but dare express a conservative view point and serve a foia request or two and they ll quite literally try to beat you from campus _meta_end_dot_

 i know you re busy today _meta_end_dot_

 i know there s a part of you that says this isn t your problem _meta_end_dot_

 there s a part of you that says everyone else is going to help i don t need to please warm up your backhand and slap that part of you around a little bit _meta_end_dot_

 we need you today _meta_end_exclamation_
