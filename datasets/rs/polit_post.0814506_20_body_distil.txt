  the rumors that hillary clinton may be barack obama s running mate are now officially rampant _meta_end_dot_

 i am in no position to offer advice to democrats but i think that this is inane _meta_end_dot_

 we already have clinton on record as having said that she and john mccain would bring a lifetime of experience to the presidency while barack obama would only bring his anti iraq war speech from _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 at least one of her key supporters perhaps with clinton s private backing is making nice campaign you got here obama _meta_end_dot_

 too bad if anything should happen to it threats _meta_end_dot_

 and even if a obama clinton ticket makes its way to the white house the new president would need foodtasters _meta_end_dot_

 the clintons are not used to sharing power and don t do it gracefully _meta_end_dot_

 indeed given this story one can only conclude that the clintons are effectively blackmailing obama into offering her the second slot if only to perhaps keep hillary clinton from pressing her case right up to the convention _meta_end_dot_

 if this is anyone s idea of a strong potential president i would collapse from sheer shock _meta_end_dot_

 vice presidents add nothing to the ticket _meta_end_dot_

 people vote for the candidate at the top of the ticket not the second banana _meta_end_dot_

 to the extent that balance is required on the ticket having two senators won t provide it _meta_end_dot_

 and there are plenty of people out there who are more experienced than hillary clinton and who can step into the top job more smoothly should anything happen _meta_end_dot_

 why this pairing is even being contemplated is a mystery _meta_end_dot_

 but hey it will keep popcorn stocks high what with the viewer entertainment an obama clinton ticket would bring _meta_end_dot_
