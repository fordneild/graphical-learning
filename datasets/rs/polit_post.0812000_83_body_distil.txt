  it s not a bad commercial but it could be better _meta_end_dot_

 the problem is and you greg davis should know because you are from the south people kind of cringe when you try to tie people directly to their pastor s words _meta_end_dot_

 so instead of hanging reverend wright s words on obama hang obama s actions on obama _meta_end_dot_

 you say but when obama s pastor cursed america blaming us for _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ childers said nothing instead you should say obama spent twenty years in a church that blames america for _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ and childers was happy to get obama s endorsement in fact here s a great script barack obama spent twenty years in a church that blames america for _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ and preaches that the government invented aids to kill black men _meta_end_dot_

 obama started and raised his family in that church _meta_end_dot_

 now barack obama has endorsed insert candidate here _meta_end_dot_

 or now insert candidate name here has endorsed liberal barack obama _meta_end_dot_

 when obama said middle america is bitter and clings to guns and god as a result insert candidate s name said nothing _meta_end_dot_

 insert candidate s name did not stand up for you _meta_end_dot_

 insert candidate s name and obama are too liberal for insert state
