  the internal debate continues _meta_end_dot_

 i predict that the next time a democrat is elected president krugman will rediscover that social security is indeed in crisis _meta_end_dot_

 and then he will ignore all of the people who point out his argumentative contortions on the issue just as he is ignoring them now _meta_end_dot_

 you see this is somehow supposed to be responsible punditry _meta_end_dot_

 and perhaps in another universe it is _meta_end_dot_

 here however it is something quite different _meta_end_dot_
