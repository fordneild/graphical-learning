  i have come to the conclusion that crack whores run the politico _meta_end_dot_

 i know that might not be a popular statement _meta_end_dot_

 after all crack whores do apparently have a better track record of credibility than the politico lately but still the only rationale i can get is that they are in somebody s pocket for their next hit of crack _meta_end_dot_

 yesterday they ran a hit job on thompson saying he was getting out of the race _meta_end_dot_

 today they say resignation greets thompson s third place _meta_end_dot_

 unfortunately for them there is again video that does not show much resignation _meta_end_dot_

 this is like roger simon s hit job also in the politico in which he claimed fred botched a meet and greet _meta_end_dot_

 yet when video came out it showed very clearly that simon had gotten it wrong _meta_end_dot_

 this is like them claiming john edwards was getting out of the race when he didn t _meta_end_dot_

 i like several of the guys at the politico a great deal but this is really pathetic _meta_end_dot_

 if not crack whores in charge i suspect they ve fallen for the shtick where they are getting good access from trusted people in one campaign and they ve begun to lose some objectivity they no longer question _meta_end_dot_

 but whether crack whores are running the place and needing to stay in good with their source of crack hit funds or whether they just have fallen in love with a particular few sources and no longer take things with grains of salt their coverage has lately been less than accurate when it comes to the thompson campaign _meta_end_dot_

 and now the fredheads want to stick it to them _meta_end_dot_
