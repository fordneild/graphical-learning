  once a well oiled machine that seemed to be able to do no wrong it now demonstrates that it has a remarkable and bizarre instinct for the capillaries _meta_end_dot_

 i mean honestly who cares if obama voted present a bunch of times as an illinois state legislator _meta_end_dot_

 does the clinton campaign really want to get into that _meta_end_question_

 because i can promise you that there have been more than a few occasions where senator clinton herself has voted present on legislation _meta_end_dot_

 does she really think that voters are going to base their choices on who took cover at what time under the umbrella of robert s rules of order or other authorities concerning parliamentary procedure _meta_end_question_

 just watch after the obama campaign responds to this we will have a whatever happened to the politics of hope emission from the clinton machine _meta_end_dot_

 because of course when barack obama started using the word hope in campaigns what he really meant was i m going to drop my fists to my sides and let my political opponents use me as a punching bag _meta_end_dot_

 god knows it s the only honorable thing to do by the way for those of you too young to remember this is indirect evidence demonstrating just how terrible george herbert walker bush s re election campaign was in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 weren t the clintons supposed to get better at campaigning as time went by _meta_end_question_
