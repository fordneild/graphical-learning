  as house republicans unveiled their economic agenda today conservatives expressed disappointment that it does nothing to address earmark reform now and instead calls for an immediate moratorium in the future _meta_end_dot_

 the document was drafted to lay out the gop s agenda in january _meta_number_ref_ if republicans reclaim control of the house _meta_end_dot_

 earmark critics however say that view is completely unrealistic _meta_end_dot_

 they think a total ban on earmarks must be instituted today because the chances of republicans taking back the house are slim _meta_end_dot_

 we need to lead by example and differentiate ourselves a conservative staffer told me _meta_end_dot_

 the economic agenda today will allow earmarks this year and the next if republicans do not win the house _meta_end_dot_

 no fundamental change from the status quo the struggle over earmarks is reflected in the differing views of two gop leaders republican study committee chairman jeb hensarling r tex and policy chairman thaddeus mccotter r mich _meta_end_dot_

 the hill reported the conflict earlier this week with hensarling demanding action now and mccotter opposed to a one size fits all ban in a memo released this afternoon hensarling reiterated his support for a ban _meta_end_dot_

 he could press the issue by bringing it to a conference wide vote _meta_end_dot_

 as i reported on redstate last night the gop s economic agenda includes many conservative proposals including a flat tax free market health care entitlement reform balanced budget and energy production _meta_end_dot_

 yet earmarks remain a sticking point despite minority leader john boehner s attempt to reach a consensus _meta_end_dot_

 conservatives don t dispute the laudable policy goals included as part of the economic agenda many developed by the republican study committee _meta_end_dot_

 but that s no excuse to take a pass on earmark reform today _meta_end_dot_

 although it remains a divisive issue for republicans hensarling should keep fighting for a ban on pork barrel projects _meta_end_dot_

 boehner faces no easy task bringing the gop together but he should view this as an opportunity for the gop to distinguish itself from democrats in advance of november s elections _meta_end_dot_

 hensarling s memo to republican study committee members is below _meta_end_dot_
