  how does one say plus a change plus c est la m me chose in russian _meta_end_question_

 understand that i ask because of this read on _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 once again the increasing lack of transparency in russia should worry us _meta_end_dot_

 russia cannot match the united states as a military power but it is no pushover and with increasing russian imperialism the efforts being undertaken by the russian leadership to put the kibosh on any semblance of democracy threaten to take the country closer to the hermit kingdom side of the governmental openness spectrum _meta_end_dot_

 hey sing it with me _meta_end_dot_

 let s make sure you know the lack of transparency is connected to the beat greater miscalculations concerning russian intentions _meta_end_dot_

 the greater miscalculations are connected to the beat strategic errors _meta_end_dot_

 the strategic errors are connected to the beat cataclysmic events _meta_end_dot_

 and the cataclysmic events are connected to the beat needless loss of life _meta_end_dot_

 not a catchy tune i know _meta_end_dot_

 but it may get played a lot if vladimir putin and dmitri medvedev get to insert coins in the geopolitical jukebox without someone objecting to the particular brand of inspiration putin and medvedev draw from the terpsichorean muse _meta_end_dot_
