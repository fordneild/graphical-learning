  the bottom line on last night s pennsylvania primary is on the surface what it has been for a while obama has the lead but he has serious problems reaching hillary s voters and the voting results seem to support the notion that who wins and loses is determined less by events than by hardened demographic facts hillary has arguments about how she s a better general election candidate but she s probably running out of forums in which to press them _meta_end_dot_

 i still think there s no way she can get the superdelegates to give her the nomination even if were to up and decide en masse that obama is by far the weaker general election candidate a point that remains fiercely debatable he represents three factions of the party african american voters hard left anti war activists and young people with little or no prior voting history who are most likely to react poorly to the perception that their candidate won at the polls but was sold out in a back room deal _meta_end_dot_

 and at that point the long term damage to the party from backing hillary will outweigh considerations of who could win this one _meta_end_dot_

 that said the democrats do have to worry that to the extent that momentum is at all discernible in this race their likely nominee has essentially negative momentum _meta_end_dot_

 obama has faced the voters in seven states in the past _meta_number_ref_ days and here are the popular vote counts obama can probably still run out the clock but he s going to end with the worst run up to the convention since gerald ford in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 and the real finish line of course is in november _meta_end_dot_
