  nro s mark hemingway reports this morning on the rumor that close associates of mitt romney are actually behind the recent anti mormon phone calls in an effort to inspire positive coverage of their candidate _meta_end_dot_

 the web of connections hemingway cites certainly supports the idea that a friends or associates of romney trying to help a candidate they support did something incredibly stupid and highly unethical _meta_end_dot_

 serving as romney s chief strategist and it appears he is closely connected to the firm placing the phone calls that mitt romney calls un american since last week a number of bloggers and others have speculated that someone close to the romney campaign was behind these phone calls _meta_end_dot_

 in response romney s most ardent conservative supporter online and over the airways has been calling these people conspiracy theorists buying into the romney campaign spin that john mccain s support for mccain feingold is responsible for these calls _meta_end_dot_

 most of us here at redstate have favored candidates in the presidential primary and even the directors of this site have different views _meta_end_dot_

 but most of us do not so willingly lose our objectivity at the drop of a hat that we cannot see reality beyond our preferred campaign s or judicial nominee s spin _meta_end_dot_

 today we want to be clear that whatever the case is we do not blame mitt romney personally for these phone calls _meta_end_dot_

 those of us with experience on the campaign trail know just how valuable and detrimental good friends left to their own devices can be _meta_end_dot_

 we do think the romney campaign and their radio mouthpiece going after john mccain is unfortunate especially given mccain himself was a victim of these types of calls in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 of all the candidates it seems clear to observers still willing to objectively observe that mccain would be the least likely candidate to organize these calls _meta_end_dot_

 the problem of course is that supposedly reliable friends would prefer to eat their own in defense of the romney campaign instead of offering straight talk and the truth _meta_end_dot_

 one could learn a lesson from rush limbaugh who has made a point of not taking sides in this campaign instead hurling his fists full force into the opposition _meta_end_dot_

 and as for alex gage and the romney associates who are apparently behind these efforts in a campaign where the faith of your candidate has been respected by the overwhelming majority of voters and activists you ve managed to create out of thin air the kind of bigoted attack that cheapens the process and expects the worst of the american people _meta_end_dot_

 nice strategy folks _meta_end_dot_

 we hope you re happy _meta_end_dot_

 update by thomas the romney campaign has responded to nro update by thomas if gage wants to put a stake in this right now all he needs to do is answer unequivocally no to this question update by thomas gage responds here _meta_end_dot_

 we ll have more to say about this soon enough _meta_end_dot_
