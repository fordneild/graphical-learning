  so now oprah s making campaign stops for her pick edited by erick barack obama the democratic presidential candidate she has already raised money for and officially endorsed _meta_end_dot_

 i m a huge oprah fan _meta_end_dot_

 i ve got her _meta_number_ref_th anniversary box set and i find her genuine kindhearted and compassionate _meta_end_dot_

 but this vocal support for a political candidate could skew the reality of obama s popularity _meta_end_dot_

 pundits on the morning news one republican one democrat didn t seem to think oprah would have much sway over the vote considering the polls didn t change when oprah first made the obama endorsement _meta_end_dot_

 however oprah does have pull and in the end it s that little bit that counts _meta_end_dot_

 she s a humanitarian but she is also a celebrity and that carries a lot of weight with some voters particularly the women that may debate between hillary and obama _meta_end_dot_

 oprah doesn t have political wisdom and though she is sincere obama is just the latest trend candidate _meta_end_dot_

 using celebrity as a political platform can represent a person or cause to be something greater than they are _meta_end_dot_

 obama seems like the book of the month unfortunately if he is a bestseller as all of oprah s suggestions are he won t be disappearing off the list for quite some time _meta_end_dot_

 this could ultimately mean a really bad review for our country _meta_end_dot_

 he s even taken on the book analogy telling reporters people are going to make the decision on how to vote not based on who s endorsing ultimately i m going to have to make the sale i wrote about this in july for human events documenting several things that show obama s probably best with the oprah audience than with the american people as a whole _meta_end_dot_

 but the truth is that a certain segment of america does trust oprah _meta_end_dot_

 and they buy her favorite things every year at christmas just because _meta_end_dot_

 it is obviously oprah s right to say and do what she pleases _meta_end_dot_

 but as some ethics would suggest just because you can doesn t mean you should _meta_end_dot_
