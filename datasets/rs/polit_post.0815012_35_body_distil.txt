  suppose you are a government employee in california authorized to conduct civil marriage ceremonies and you object on moral or religious grounds to same sex marriage _meta_end_dot_

 according to the plain logic of the california supreme court s decision earlier this month you are simply a bigot the spring of your objection is irrational prejudice _meta_end_dot_

 there is no ground for tolerance for your views precisely because your views impinge upon the fundamental rights of others _meta_end_dot_

 recall that even someone like senator obama of the view that while marriage should remain an institution exclusive to a man and a woman civil unions should be established for homosexuals is also a narrow minded bigot again according to the force of the court s logic _meta_end_dot_

 fortunately san diego county is more magnanimous than the judicial despots of the court _meta_end_dot_

 county employees will not be forced to perform marriage ceremonies to which they have a moral objection _meta_end_dot_

 los angeles county employees will not be so lucky _meta_end_dot_

 tolerance forbids their objections _meta_end_dot_

 wrote the city attorney county clerks have no legal standing to grant county employees the authority or ability to choose which marriages they wish not to officiate at based on their personal views or biases _meta_end_dot_

 the court has been crystal clear on this issue same sex couples must be afforded equal protection under the law it is instructive to observe the machinations of liberalism on this issue _meta_end_dot_

 it is not enough that approval of same sex marriage be institutionalized in law disapproval of its opponents too must be institutionalized in law _meta_end_dot_

 we cannot agree to disagree in the common catchphrase _meta_end_dot_

 for a state employee to resist blessing same sex unions is tantamount to his denial of equal protection to a certain class of people in short unconstitutional _meta_end_dot_

 libertarians can hardly go a day without denouncing the imposition of morality by traditionalists yet the imposition contemplated by los angeles county in accordance with the court s clear logic eludes their attention _meta_end_dot_

 in this our dear libertarians simply resemble liberals in their quaint innocence of what a public orthodoxy is _meta_end_dot_

 to use their cherished parlance never has there existed a society that did not impose morality _meta_end_dot_

 the imposition of morality is a concomitant of social order _meta_end_dot_

 no orthodoxy no society _meta_end_dot_

 that liberals and libertarians are uncomfortable with words like orthodoxy in no way changes the fact that they seek to impose one just like anyone else _meta_end_dot_

 in our country no one imposes morality like supreme courts _meta_end_dot_

 we are at the point where it is possible to answer the question who rules america _meta_end_question_

 with a single word courts perhaps someone among out liberals and libertarians would like to make a forthright argument for judicial aristocracy _meta_end_dot_

 that at least would have the virtue of candor _meta_end_dot_
