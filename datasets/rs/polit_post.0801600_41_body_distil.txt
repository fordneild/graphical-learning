  because we here at redstate are all about pushing the edges of the medium we re going to try something different tonight _meta_end_dot_

 the polls should be closing even as we speak and i have a rental disc of the movie shoot em up to watch _meta_end_dot_

 no reason why i can t do both right _meta_end_question_

 don t answer that _meta_end_dot_

 we ll start with the traditional is there a blipping site giving results that doesn t crash every fifteen seconds it ll give me a chance to get the dvd function on the computer to work _meta_end_dot_

 update _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ pm est good thing that i started early because apparently i need to try getting the movie to load on my wife s computer _meta_end_dot_

 update _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ pm est marvel at the triumph of the human species over adversity _meta_end_exclamation_

 movie s up ready to go i have fritos i have coca cola i have _meta_end_dot_

 no websites to get results from _meta_end_dot_

 hold on _meta_end_dot_

 everything else under the fold _meta_end_dot_

 update _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ pm well that s one way to sever the umbilical cord _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ in and the death toll already has reached double digits one involving a carrot _meta_end_dot_

 i approve _meta_end_dot_

 hey they re all bad _meta_end_dot_

 anyway at _meta_percent_ref_ in drudge reports romney _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ pm baby aged six months in one minute and aww but don t you just hate it when you aren t actually too evil to abandon one after all _meta_end_question_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ pm finally the cnn site _meta_end_dot_

 at _meta_percent_ref_ dem it s clinton _meta_percent_ref_ uncommitted _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 if that holds out it s going to look bad for the other two real candidates that dropped _meta_end_dot_

 gop _meta_percent_ref_ romney _meta_percent_ref_ mccain _meta_percent_ref_ huckabee _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 meanwhile the baby is now wearing the hero s sock _meta_end_dot_

 there is some faint hope that a bus is about to be shot up _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ smooth move ronin _meta_end_dot_

 just got some good samaritan killed _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_percent_ref_ and _meta_percent_ref_ respectively no real change _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ pm ah the secondary character after some gratuitous nudity _meta_end_dot_

 jeebus knows this campaign could use some _meta_end_dot_

 i kid i kid _meta_end_dot_

 ewww _meta_end_dot_

 no not the _meta_percent_ref_ no change _meta_end_dot_

 the scene _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ pm yeah i hate people who park wrongly in handicapped spots but possibly not as badly as the hero _meta_end_dot_

 nope not enough of a sob to get slapped around _meta_end_dot_

 and i m starting to dislike the villain s wife s timing too _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_percent_ref_ nothing happening hey we re about to have a car battle _meta_end_exclamation_

 no just pushing some twit off the road _meta_end_dot_

 again jeebus knows _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ pm _meta_percent_ref_ cnn calls it for clinton romney the baby s in a bulletproof vest and they got _meta_number_ref_ guys which will just have to do _meta_end_dot_

 guess that this didn t last long _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ pm oddly enough as above so below at _meta_percent_ref_ and _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ tedious blah blah blah has set in _meta_end_dot_

 more gunplay _meta_end_exclamation_

 more _meta_end_exclamation_

 more _meta_end_exclamation_

 i m still not satisfied _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ pm good gun advice to the baby _meta_end_dot_

 and yeah ben s right this election needs more monica bellucci _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ pm this movie is apparently ostensibly about gun control _meta_end_dot_

 given that the death count is roughly triple digits by now i suspect that the ostensibly is even more tongue in cheek than usual _meta_end_dot_

 meanwhile _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ romney s breathing easier and there s going to be no real reason for obama and edwards to push to have michigan s delegates seated at the convention _meta_end_dot_

 pause suckers _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ pm well at least it s a democratic senator breeding babies for bone marrow _meta_end_dot_

 and selling out to the evvvvillll gun lobby at the first hint of problems _meta_end_dot_

 this is turning out to be a surprisingly apropos choice _meta_end_dot_

 except for maybe the sky diving gun battle _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ pm hey _meta_end_exclamation_

 he shot a guy with his hand and got a dog _meta_end_exclamation_

 score _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ pm well that s the movie which lasted about three times as long as any suspense in this primary and what have we learned _meta_end_question_

 well aside from the fact that there s a lot of ways to get killed by a firearm this movie is so totally worth a rental i only regret not drinking beer i suppose that it shows that you just can t walk away from a screaming baby even if it means removing every pro from dover within a twenty mile radius _meta_end_dot_

 the parallels between this and our current political situation are so obvious as to not need elucidating of course _meta_end_dot_

 good night and remember what paul giamatti and constant reader raven says guns don t kill people but they sure help _meta_end_dot_
