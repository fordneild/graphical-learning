  with two weeks left in november this is the last week that the house is scheduled to be in session and to no one s surprise congress continues to earn the title of do nothing congress in fact over the past _meta_number_ref_ months it has become crystal clear that the democrat majority is doing absolutely nothing for the american people except trying every which way to raise taxes _meta_end_dot_

 last week was veterans day and what did congress do for our service men and women who daily sacrifice their lives for our country _meta_end_question_

 nothing _meta_end_dot_

 read on _meta_end_dot_

 the majority made a conscious decision to play politics with our troops well being by not bringing the veteran s affairs military construction appropriations bill to vote _meta_end_dot_

 as i have stated before several of my colleagues and i sent a letter to speaker pelosi urging her to remember our nation s military by reaching a prompt agreement on the conference report of that appropriations bill _meta_end_dot_

 of course we still have received no response from her or the democratic leadership _meta_end_dot_

 with a second continuing resolution in effect set to expire december _meta_number_ref_th or two and a half months after the official start of the new fiscal year let s see if the democrats actually help our nation s current and future veterans or just chose to continue to rudely ignore them _meta_end_dot_

 also this friday is the irs s deadline to finalize next year s tax forms and if the democrats continue to neglect the alternative minimum tax millions of middle class americans will be denied the refunds they deserve _meta_end_dot_

 the democrats have purposely chosen not to extend the gop congress patch for the amt and they have failed to present the president with a commonsense solution for fixing this unfair and outdated tax _meta_end_dot_

 if the democrats don t pass a patch by early december _meta_dollor_ref_ billion in taxpayer refunds will be delayed according to the irs and u s _meta_end_dot_

 treasury department _meta_end_dot_

 and if they continue to wait to address this important issue until next year millions more middle class families will be ensnared by the amt on april _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 even rank and file democrats are beginning to question the democrat leadership s inability to get this task done _meta_end_dot_

 once again our nation s hard working taxpayers are being forced to bear the financial burden of the lack of leadership in the house _meta_end_dot_

 in all fairness the democrats did pass the largest tax increase in american history this year demonstrating utter disregard for our hardworking taxpayers _meta_end_dot_

 i guess they re doing something _meta_end_dot_
