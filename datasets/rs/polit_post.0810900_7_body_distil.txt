  in response to critical blog posts concerning barack obama by my colleague erick erickson we have this response which is supposed to tell us _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 what _meta_end_question_

 that jesus calls upon erick to repent _meta_end_question_

 that obama does _meta_end_question_

 that there is no difference between the two _meta_end_question_

 that erick is one of the scribes or pharisees and does not understand that obama jesus is absolving the sinners _meta_end_question_

 that john mccain is marked by the number _meta_number_ref_ and will be defeated by obama in the end times and that in the meantime those of us who have not experienced the rapture and joined the obama campaign ought to do our best not to given in during the tribulation and join or donate money to the mccain campaign _meta_end_question_

 i suppose that all of these questions deserve answers _meta_end_dot_

 but i tell you dear readers i am thinking very seriously about quitting redstate and going over to be a daily kos writer _meta_end_dot_

 that way i can cover my bases and root for obama full bore _meta_end_dot_

 remember i am jewish _meta_end_dot_

 and it s a risky thing to deny someone hailed as the messiah _meta_end_dot_

 we have a reputation for that sort of thing whether deserved or not and it has led to trouble for us in the past _meta_end_dot_
