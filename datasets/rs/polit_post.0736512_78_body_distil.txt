  with apologies to dan mclaughlin in case he was intending to blog on this and here i am beating him to it he made a good point in email this morning that too have noticed _meta_end_dot_

 and it goes right back to something mickey kaus wrote about last week _meta_end_dot_

 those friends of mine who are web heavy are aware of fred thompson s campaign think he has a shot and are mostly on board his campaign and understand the media game being played _meta_end_dot_

 those who only get their news from the drive bys have become largely dismissive of the thompson campaign as not viable _meta_end_dot_

 in the same way friends who get their news from he drive bys don t know anything about ron paul and just assume there are fringe nutters putting up ron paul signs all over the country side _meta_end_dot_

 those who get their news online have realized that in addition to the fringe nutters organizing inside the asylum for ron paul there is a healthy undercurrent of support for paul out there among mainstream libertarian oriented and anti war oriented voters _meta_end_dot_

 until plugged in america becomes dominate over tuned in america the political blogosphere is going to have influence in shaping the message but will not really be able to set the narrative without help _meta_end_dot_

 that s not new but it is reinforced even this year when the rise of the blogs were supposed to be the undoing of the drive bys _meta_end_dot_
