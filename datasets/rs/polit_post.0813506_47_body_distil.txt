  another tuesday another presidential primary _meta_end_dot_

 and in shocking news hillary clinton announces that she is not going to get out of the presidential race just yet _meta_end_dot_

 her campaign communications director howard wolfson got on cnn this evening and insisted that the magic number for delegates is _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ and yes that is the number that you get if you include florida and michigan in the mix _meta_end_dot_

 we are obviously going to go to june _meta_number_ref_rd and perhaps longer if the clintons believe that they have any chance whatsoever of winning the nomination or at least going on long enough to ensure that they are able to extract concessions or even set up barack obama for a defeat in the fall thus opening the way for hillary clinton to capture the nomination in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 meanwhile it isn t as if republicans don t have problems _meta_end_dot_

 there is no denying it anymore if it could even be denied in the run up to tonight republicans have serious problems with the brand identity _meta_end_dot_

 yes i know that there are six months left until the election but what else needs to occur for the gop to realize that it has a very serious problem on its hands _meta_end_question_

 there have been any number of indications concerning a republican image problem and nothing has been done to ameliorate matters _meta_end_dot_

 either republican leaders get on the ball very quickly or the gop is headed for yet another round of epic congressional losses _meta_end_dot_

 this is all obvious i know _meta_end_dot_

 but apparently the republican congressional leadership class has still not caught on _meta_end_dot_
