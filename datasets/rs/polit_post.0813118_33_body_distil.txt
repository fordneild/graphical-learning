  while in the process of reading this national interest attempt to link american foreign policy positions to the godfather and this rather well done beatdown of said attempt via ace i was reminded of the clip below via hot air which i should have mentioned at the time or try this youtube which actually works do you know why we don t trust the democrats on foreign policy _meta_end_question_

 it s because too many of them applaud when national security ignoramuses make ignorant statements like that _meta_end_dot_

 or as see dubya put it very succinctly please democrats nominate this man i m learning to enjoy watching people stop by three times a week to earnestly and somewhat desperately explain the latest damfool thing that came out of his mouth _meta_end_dot_
