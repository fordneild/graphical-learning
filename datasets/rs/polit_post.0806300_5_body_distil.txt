 never mind on ftn bob schieffer talked to hillary surrogate evan bayh and obama surrogate chris dodd _meta_end_dot_

 it was the usual divisive squabble but schieffer seemed most concerned about bayh s admission that as a member of the senate intelligence committee he had been told that it was not a question of if al qaeda attacks the u s _meta_end_dot_

 again but when they do _meta_end_dot_

 schieffer wanted to know if bayh had any idea when and bayh told him that it was common knowledge that al qaeda would attack again _meta_end_dot_

 next up schieffer had the bearded bill richardson who refused to endorse anyone but said that he is tired of the bickering like that we d heard between bayh and dodd _meta_end_dot_

 on le wolf blitzer first talked to obama surrogate john kerry _meta_end_dot_

 kerry said the usual stuff but the funniest part was when he expressed concern that people would hear the telephone ringing in hillary s commercial and mistake it for their own phone _meta_end_dot_

 he also claimed that obama has more foreign policy experience now than what ronald reagan had when he was sworn in in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 puppets _meta_end_dot_

 durbin and di fi on fns _meta_end_dot_

 senators dick durbin an obama supporter and diane feinstein hillary s california girl talked to fox news sunday host chris wallace and it was typical of this constant rat a tat a tat of the hired guns the surrogates yapping back and forth _meta_end_dot_

 wallace played about two seconds from the hillary commercial asking whom america wishes to save the children by answering the phone at _meta_number_ref_ am _meta_end_dot_

 feinstein said i know hillary is tested and ready as proof she offered that hillary has been endorsed by three dozen flag officers _meta_end_dot_

 now obama had answered the commercial by pointing out that hillary answered the phone at _meta_number_ref_ am and decided to invade iraq but feinstein reminded us that hillary s vote on the iraq invasion came after days of careful deliberation by the senate not from some early am phone call _meta_end_dot_

 she added that hillary is qualified because she is married to president bill she s been tested by the anvil of a white house for eight years wallace played a clip of obama accusing hillary of fear mongering durbin said that it doesn t matter if you re awake for the _meta_number_ref_ am phone call rather it s the judgment you use on the phone once you understand what is being said _meta_end_dot_

 he said that obama used the right judgment on iraq _meta_end_dot_

 he wasn t serving in the senate thus he wasn t called dick durbin wants hillary out of the race _meta_end_dot_

 he declared that if she doesn t do well on tuesday i hope she makes an honest appraisal of her chances wallace asks if it will hurt obama if she does not quit and durbin reported that everyone wants the democratic party to be united and to win _meta_end_dot_

 he admitted that he knows obama better than any other elected official did durbin help to create obama s political persona karl rove on fns _meta_end_dot_

 host wallace next talked to republican strategist karl rove _meta_end_dot_

 the interview dealt with how best john mccain could run against presumptive dem nominee barack obama _meta_end_dot_

 rove warned that john mccain needs to treat obama s words as if they were serious not as mere empty platitudes _meta_end_dot_

 mccain he said should also point out the gap between the rhetoric and the reality _meta_end_dot_

 mccain rove argued needs to create an image of himself as a reform minded leader on iraq when obama starts talking about the cost of the war rove says mccain needs to make clear the cost of leaving the planet s third largest oil reserves to the whims of al qaeda or of iran _meta_end_dot_

 what will matter rove declared was the state of the economy this fall and he s not sure if obama s isolationist populist campaign will work in the general elections _meta_end_dot_

 rove argued that despite obama s protests to the contrary every presidential election is about change the future rather than the past karl rove thinks that using barack obama s middle name hussein would turn into a negative for mccain as it goes too far and people see it as going too far _meta_end_dot_

 if you want to help mccain he argued don t do it _meta_end_dot_

 on tuesday s contests rove conceded the possibility that hillary could possibly do well in ohio but then he d have to see how she did with the popular vote in texas _meta_end_dot_

 he added though that it would be a mistake for obama to call on her to drop out _meta_end_dot_

 wolfson and axelrod on tw _meta_end_dot_

 word is that howard wolfson from hillary s camp and david axelrod from barry s are friends in real life _meta_end_dot_

 they did not act it this morning on abc s this week with george stephanopoulos _meta_end_dot_

 actually they behaved like children and somebody should take away their yummy candy bars _meta_end_dot_

 axelrod when talking about barry endorsements pointed out that jay rockefeller had endorsed obama _meta_end_dot_

 both rockefeller and obama opposed the war he pointed out _meta_end_dot_

 wolfson countered that when obama got in the u s _meta_end_dot_

 senate he did nothing to stop the war _meta_end_dot_

 wolfson added that obama chairs the senate national security subcommittee on european affairs and that he his subcommittee has held no hearings as obama has run for president _meta_end_dot_

 axelrod countered that obama asked some tough questions of condoleezza rice at her confirmation hearings before becoming secretary of state _meta_end_dot_

 wolfson promised that hillary will release all of her tax returns on or around april _meta_number_ref_ axelrod proclaimed that obama has talked to both papers the sun times and the tribune of chicago about his rezco stuff _meta_end_dot_

 wolfson argued that obama refuses to release information on his rezco real estate transactions and wolfson countered that he thought the clintons would be the last people to raise a stink over a real estate transaction _meta_end_dot_

 in effect then obama s guy compared his candidates rezco problems with the clintons whitewater scandal _meta_end_dot_

 who s going to take the mcdougal fall for barry mtp strategist roundtable _meta_end_dot_

 here was tim russert again chatting with bob shrum james carville mary matalin and mike murphy _meta_end_dot_

 first russert showed a bunch of polls including breakdown by sex and racial category _meta_end_dot_

 russert asked carville what they tell him and carville said nothing _meta_end_dot_

 murphy said they show a close range but he wants to know how many young people show up _meta_end_dot_

 bob shrum said something but it came across as a series of buzzes and clicks _meta_end_dot_

 he compared hillary to the beach boys and obama to the beatles _meta_end_dot_

 matalin said that she would tell hillary that she can t close the deal murphy his hair looking disheveled said that what hillary has working for her is the near death experience comeback kid blah blah carville said that hillary has to win somewhere to change the momentum _meta_end_dot_

 if she wins ohio and texas he said there s not a single person in pennsylvania who s going to say we do not want to weigh in on this sorry jim but i don t want to weigh in on this _meta_end_dot_

 i don t want the commercials _meta_end_dot_

 i don t want the candidate visits from those two or gawdforbid william jefferson blythe murphy suggested that if she wins ohio and texas on tuesday then takes pennsylvania next month _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ she still won t have enough delegates to clinch it _meta_end_dot_

 shrum suggested the superdelegates swinging back her way he said she was to win pennsylvania convincingly then north carolina may _meta_number_ref_ and mississippi march _meta_number_ref_ even though mississippi is before pennsylvania _meta_end_dot_

 it s the dems calendar but shrum doesn t know the dates and probably would lose the thing which is why he s on the sideline this year _meta_end_dot_

 matalin pointed out that puerto rico has _meta_number_ref_ delegates _meta_end_dot_

 that s on june _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 it would be a fine thing if this thing kept going while mccain stashed his money and grinned _meta_end_dot_

 dodd and bayh on ftn _meta_end_dot_

 on cbs s face the nation venerable host bob schieffer also did the surrogate thaang dodd for barry bayh for hillary _meta_end_dot_

 bayh liked hillary on snl last night _meta_end_dot_

 schieffer played hillary s _meta_number_ref_ am phone call children asleep commercial _meta_end_dot_

 bayh does not think the commercial is fear mongering he said that he said he sits on the intelligence committee and they told him the other day that it is not question of if we ll be attacked by al qaeda but when _meta_end_dot_

 schieffer asked him who had told him this and bayh said that the intelligence community has stated it publicly _meta_end_dot_

 schieffer seemed astounded by this asking if our intelligence community has any idea when this attack is going to happen _meta_end_dot_

 bayh said no but it is common knowledge that they ll try again _meta_end_dot_

 dodd down in texas campaigning for barry said that barry would prevent that attack _meta_end_dot_

 he said that barry is eminently qualified because dick lugar took him to russia _meta_end_dot_

 he said that life experience where you come from background counts more than number of years in the senate and with your husband in the white house _meta_end_dot_

 schieffer played obama s commercial retort which says that he ll answer the phone because he knew that the danger was al qaeda in afghanistan and not iraq _meta_end_dot_

 bayh countered that the dems have two great candidates _meta_end_dot_

 he credited obama with giving a speech opposing iraq but he pointed out that obama said that he didn t know how he would have voted if he had been in the senate and since he has joined the senate his voting record is nearly identical to that of hillary _meta_end_dot_

 dodd said that the dems have two good candidates and he hopes the dems race does not become divisive _meta_end_dot_

 he said that these commercials were divisive _meta_end_dot_

 bill richardson on ftn _meta_end_dot_

 the only relevant question for richardson and it is not very relevant anyway is whether he would endorse hillary or barry before tuesday s texas primary where hispanic voters supposedly might be influenced by his word _meta_end_dot_

 for today a bearded bill richardson said not right now he s tired of the bickering like that which went on between bayh and dodd _meta_end_dot_

 he said that after tuesday the party should settle on the candidate with the most delegates and come together and see where we are and move on toward the general election ho _meta_end_dot_

 hum _meta_end_dot_

 kerry on le _meta_end_dot_

 on cnn late edition host wolf blitzer brought us john kerry for obama _meta_end_dot_

 blitzer asked kerry what happens if it s a spit on tuesday and kerry said that this is up to the hillary campaign _meta_end_dot_

 he added that if hillary doesn t win big she can t catch up and should look at the reality kerry said that if the superdelegates take over and pick the candidate it would violate the grassroots of the party _meta_end_dot_

 it would be very fractious and difficult for the party wolf asked him why not just get rid of the superdelegates and kerry said that this might be an outcome _meta_end_dot_

 he told blitzer erroneously that the superdelegates were added to the dem nominating process after mcgovern _meta_number_ref_ and dukakis _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 they were added after _meta_number_ref_ to prevent teddy kennedy from taking the nomination from fritz in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 john kerry expressed concern that those who hear hillary s _meta_number_ref_ am telephone commercial are going to mistakenly think that their own phone is ringing _meta_end_dot_

 i m not kidding folks john kerry said that barack obama comes to the race with more experience in foreign policy than ronald reagan had which is another lie _meta_end_dot_

 reyes on le _meta_end_dot_

 hillary s supporter house intelligence committee chairman silvestre reyes d texas had to convince blitzer that it was not all over for her _meta_end_dot_

 reyes said that not only can she win texas i think she will win he does not see any obama momentum in texas pointing out that an el paso county commissioner recently switched his support from obama to hillary _meta_end_dot_

 he thinks there is a real possibility that this could go to the convention _meta_end_dot_

 blitzer played a clip of president bush chiding congressional dems on fisa _meta_end_dot_

 reyes said that house passed their version last november but the senate didn t pass their version until last month _meta_end_dot_

 he accused the senate of trying to force the house to accept their version by passing it just before the act expired _meta_end_dot_

 blitzer played a clip of national intelligence directory mike mcconnell saying that the u s _meta_end_dot_

 is less safe today because we ve lost our ability to monitor terrorists what with the house delaying passage _meta_end_dot_

 reyes said that it did not harm our ability to monitor but that hopefully in the next week they ll be able to bring the new bill to a vote _meta_end_dot_

 blunt on le _meta_end_dot_

 blitzer s next guest was house republican whip roy blunt of missouri seated at a small round glass table in the dc studio _meta_end_dot_

 wolf of course was in miami blunt says he s not quite that optimistic yet that the house will pass then new fisa in a week _meta_end_dot_

 he pointed out that we re not as safe as we were because the original _meta_number_ref_ fisa law was writ for old tech _meta_end_dot_

 we need the authority blunt argued to intercept foreign terrorist communications as it happens not after applying for and receiving a warrant _meta_end_dot_

 wolf showed blunt a clip of iranian president borat receiving the red carpet treatment in baghdad _meta_end_dot_

 he asked if this is why we went to war in iraq to allow them to meet with the iranians _meta_end_dot_

 blunt explained that we went to war to allow iraq to have a free government and free governments are allowed to do what they want in meeting with their neighbors _meta_end_dot_

 wolf asked him what kind of message it sends and blunt answered that it shows that the maliki s government is not a puppet of the u s _meta_end_dot_

 blitzer played a clip of chuck hagel using the old overburdened canard _meta_end_dot_

 blunt responded that things are getting better in iraq and he likes to see the political progress taking place now _meta_end_dot_

 those were the sunday shows _meta_end_dot_

 have at it _meta_end_exclamation_
