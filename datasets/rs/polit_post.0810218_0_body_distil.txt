  as pointed out by pejman a new ap ipsos poll finds that senator john mccain the republican presidential nominee to be has erased obama s _meta_number_ref_ point lead and is now tied with obama _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 perhaps the constant hammering obama has taken recently from nonpartisan fact checkers and numerous media outlets for his and the democrats gross distortion of mccain s _meta_number_ref_ years comment caught up with obama _meta_end_dot_

 the ap ipsos poll like this recent rasmussen poll provides more evidence that the democrats face a serious problem with democrat deserters not a good omen for obama _meta_end_dot_
