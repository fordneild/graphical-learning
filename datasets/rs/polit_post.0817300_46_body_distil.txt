  i asked yesterday how barack obama who opposed the fisa bill last time it came around and specifically opposed the telecom immunity provisions would handle the compromise by which nearly the same bill has now passed the house and will return to the senate with sufficient votes to pass _meta_end_dot_

 you will recall the emphatic nature of obama s statement in opposition well anyone who was observing this campaign to find out whether obama has credibility when he draws that kind of line now has their answer he folds like a cheap suit _meta_beep_ref_ the left wingers who supported obama and thought he would actually take a stand rather than issue some empty words have now joined that crowd under the obama bus _meta_end_dot_

 welcome to the general election folks _meta_end_dot_

 hope you didn t actually believe that hope and change meant a new and different kind of candidate _meta_end_dot_

 obama may be just as left wing as you are by all indications he is and just as immune to understanding the way the world works but he does know how to read polls and he doesn t have much experience standing his ground under fire _meta_end_dot_

 so while his statement pretty much admits that his lines that cannot be crossed have in fact been crossed he s just not going to do anything about it obama leaves open the suggestioin that he might try to alter the bill before it reaches the president s desk of course if he means he will do that now that would bust up the compromise and get us back to square one and there are already enough senators on board with telecom immunity that no such thing will happen unless obama uses the influence of his position as head of his party to bend the democratic caucus to his will another thing he has no record of ever doing _meta_end_dot_

 you know and i know that if he starts off from a position of saying he support s the compromise that s not gonna happen _meta_end_dot_

 it s a hollow threat _meta_end_dot_

 if obama means that when he gets elected he ll restore the ability to sue the telecom companies well he is probably relying on hope that his supporters don t know that it would be an unconstitutional violation of separation of powers to reopen what will by then be final judgments _meta_end_dot_

 so at the end of the day when obama says that a line can t be crossed and it then gets crossed how can we summarize his response _meta_end_question_

 i think jim carrey s character in liar liar summarized it well today obama s spinelessness is in service of our national security so i applaud it _meta_end_dot_

 let s just hope we never see the day when his spine is what we depend on to protect our security _meta_end_dot_
