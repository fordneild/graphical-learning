  they look like an ordinary every day couple blessed with a beautiful little girl and little baby celeste is indeed beautiful isn t she don t they _meta_end_question_

 john may seem a few decades older than jenny but that is far from uncommon and no more a cause for a raise of the eyebrow than it has ever been _meta_end_dot_

 special is that john and jenny are not married and yet strangely enough jenny bears the same legal last name as john _meta_end_dot_

 coincidence as is _meta_number_ref_ _meta_percent_ref_ the case in these situations _meta_end_question_

 no _meta_end_dot_

 not really _meta_end_dot_

 that s because john there on the left is jenny s father _meta_end_dot_

 he is also celeste s father _meta_end_dot_

 and grandfather _meta_end_dot_

 i ve said this before and i ll say it again the question of whether or not incestuous couples should be allowed to marry is going to come up and i m thinking it s going to be sooner rather than later _meta_end_dot_

 and from a legal standpoint they re going to win in any jurisdiction that grants recognition to same sex pairs on the basis of rights _meta_end_dot_

 gay marriage advocates routinely make the argument that loving v virginia should also apply to people of the same sex as it applies to men and women of different races _meta_end_dot_

 of course since interracial marriages which have the tendency of producing healthy children at no less a clip as marriages of the same race have existed since the dawn of time and same sex marriages are a relatively new invention _meta_end_dot_

 either way even if we accept this why should this argument about the right to marry not apply to an american version of john and jenny deaves _meta_end_question_

 the interesting thing about a right is that it does not rely on numbers _meta_end_dot_

 even if richard loving and mildred jeter were the only interracial couple in the united states that wanted their marriage to be recognized and respected by the state virginia s anti miscegenation laws would still not have been constitutional _meta_end_dot_

 so even if it were just one father and daughter couple that are demanding a marriage license as a matter of rights their claim is equally as valid as that of ten thousand such incestuous couples with the goodridge decision the supreme court of massachusetts has established that the institution of marriage is all about satisfying the sexual and emotional needs of any pair of consenting adults essentially excising procreation and any long term societal interests from the institution in that state _meta_end_dot_

 well as jenny deave above says she and her father are in their relationship as consenting adults and they want their relationship accorded respect and understanding _meta_end_dot_

 in other words not just tolerance but ultimately full fledged societal acceptance _meta_end_dot_

 soon enough america s own john and jenny of e g _meta_end_dot_

 san francisco i think one is more likely to find this sort of thing in progressive hip and edgy liberal cities than in the more traditional conservative parts of america photogenic well educated gainfully employed financially comfortable and incestuous as all heck are going to move to massachusetts and apply for a marriage license _meta_end_dot_

 those who say it ll never happen should consider that one of the most effective arguments that was used to derailed the era equal rights amendment in the _meta_number_ref_s was that it would compel states to issue marriage licenses to homosexual couples _meta_end_dot_

 liberal era supporters scoffed whoever heard of such a thing _meta_end_question_

 a wo man getting married to another wo man _meta_end_question_

 ha _meta_end_exclamation_

 crazy right wing fascists _meta_end_exclamation_

 impossible _meta_end_exclamation_

 it ll never happen _meta_end_exclamation_

 oh well _meta_end_dot_

 brave new world _meta_end_dot_

 in the meantime i think i ll just continue to stand athwart history yelling stop _meta_end_exclamation_
