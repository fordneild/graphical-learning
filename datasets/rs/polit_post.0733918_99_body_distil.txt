  the accuracy of the latest nie on iran should be received with a good deal of skepticism _meta_end_dot_

 our intelligence community has often underestimated the intentions of adversaries including saddam hussein s iraq and north korea _meta_end_dot_

 and are all of the cia detractors now going to take intelligence pronouncements at face value _meta_end_question_

 it s awfully convenient for a lot of people the administration gets to say its policies worked the democrats get to claim we should have eased up on iran a long time ago and russia and china can claim sanctions on iran are not necessary _meta_end_dot_

 who benefits from all this _meta_end_question_

 iran _meta_end_dot_

 and what if the nie estimate is accurate _meta_end_question_

 it s essentially an analysis of iran s intentions at a point in time _meta_end_dot_

 meanwhile iran continues to enrich uranium for allegedly peaceful purposes but which would allow them to easily transition to a nuclear weapons program at any point in the future _meta_end_dot_

 maybe even now now that so many seem willing to forget iran s past deceptions and ongoing intransigence _meta_end_dot_

 after all a nuclear weapons program is simply an extension of the process by why uranium is enriched for civilian nuclear fuel _meta_end_dot_

 to this day iran has yet to comply with international demands and its nuclear non proliferation treaty requirements for open inspections and other safeguard measures _meta_end_dot_

 the bottom line is that the united states must continue to improve its human intelligence capabilities and intelligence analysis _meta_end_dot_

 we must hope for the best but not let our guard down for a moment _meta_end_dot_

 if something appears to be too good to be true it very well may be _meta_end_dot_
