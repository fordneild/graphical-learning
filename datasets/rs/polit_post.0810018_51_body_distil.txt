  i m a fan of the olympic games _meta_end_dot_

 my family and i look forward to watching individuals from all over the world compete for the gold in beijing china _meta_end_dot_

 i m always proud of our nation s athletes they have worked tirelessly for the chance to participate _meta_end_dot_

 but recently i have been frustrated with the chinese government s detestable human rights decisions _meta_end_dot_

 i believe it is horrific that china supports sudan s genocidal regime persecutes citizens for practicing religion and denies basic freedoms to their own people _meta_end_dot_

 these oppressive actions must be stopped _meta_end_dot_

 i recently signed onto hr _meta_number_ref_ a bill that would require president bush and other american politicians to boycott the opening ceremonies of the olympics _meta_end_dot_

 i believe this sends a crucial message to china and other nations the united states will not tolerate oppressive actions that prohibit freedom _meta_end_dot_

 this bill does not punish the athletes who have spent hours upon hours training for various events _meta_end_dot_

 and it does not prohibit them from competing _meta_end_dot_

 for the victims in china i hope president bush hears us _meta_end_dot_
