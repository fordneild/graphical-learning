  with a day left before the caucuses here s your chance to analyze predict or just straight pimp your candidate _meta_end_dot_

 my _meta_number_ref_ cents the graph above seems to show there are two races in ia the race for first between huck and romney and the race for third between fred mccain ron paul and rudy _meta_end_dot_

 my questions will fred quit the race if he finishes behind a candidate who is not really campaigning in iowa mccain _meta_end_question_

 can rudy really be considered the national frontrunner if he comes in _meta_number_ref_th _meta_end_question_

 can huck win any states if he loses ia _meta_end_question_
