  the louisiana legislature has held governor jindal s reformist agenda hostage _meta_end_dot_

 the legislators who are only part time legislators want pay increases from _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ a year to _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ and they want an annual increase in their salaries after that for their part time job _meta_end_dot_

 sadly the legislators have been fairly united _meta_end_dot_

 more than two thirds in each house have told governor jindal that they will kill every one of his legislative proposals unless he goes along with this salary increase _meta_end_dot_

 he has no choice but to agree to the ransom _meta_end_dot_

 on the bright side this is probably a response to governor jindal s ethics reforms _meta_end_dot_

 now that the legislators cannot take bribes as easily they need the extra income _meta_end_dot_

 nonetheless it is shameful _meta_end_dot_

 speaker jim tucker s phone number is _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 the vote will happen today _meta_end_dot_

 whether you live in louisiana or not you should call the speaker and tell him how very shameful the legislature s conduct is _meta_end_dot_
