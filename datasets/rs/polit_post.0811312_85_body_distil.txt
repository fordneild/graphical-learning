  unfortunately due to the press of other business we only had a few of the contributors available to participate in the latest roundtable _meta_end_dot_

 but feel free to weigh in with your own thoughts _meta_end_dot_

 looking beyond the white house republicans will be running in _meta_number_ref_ senate races _meta_number_ref_ governors races and several hundred house races a number of which will be hotly contested plus state legislative and other campaigns _meta_end_dot_

 what should be the most important races of those the ones in which money and attention from bloggers and activists will have the greatest potential to have impact _meta_end_question_

 read on _meta_end_dot_

 dan mclaughlin my attention naturally starts with the senate races listed here here and here to my mind the really crucial senate races are minnesota colorado louisiana new mexico and new hampshire probably in that order _meta_end_dot_

 norm coleman in mn hasn t always made conservatives happy but he really is a smart hard working and articulate spokesman for us when he gets on an issue his state is one where we are fighting to keep a foothold and _meta_end_dot_

 well al franken in the senate _meta_end_question_

 that s intolerable _meta_end_dot_

 the open seats in co nm are also states where we can t afford to have a tipping point to democrat control of the state whereas la is the one genuinely serious pickup opportunity we have this year to offset almost certain defeat in virginia _meta_end_dot_

 and i know some people are ready to write off john sununu but i have to think that race will go down to the wire and a mccain obama matchup is very favorable for us in nh _meta_end_dot_

 i wish i had more faith in our chances to pick off tim johnson _meta_end_dot_

 me or ak may be fights as well _meta_end_dot_

 i defer to others on the house races _meta_end_dot_

 my guess on the gov races here is that defending in mitch daniels and mo and the rossi gregoire rematch in wa will be the races to watch _meta_end_dot_

 wa is a state where we keep losing close races and could really use to win one and rossi s a good candidate _meta_end_dot_

 adam c senate in order of likely r loss ak sd currently d _meta_end_dot_

 the dashes represent where if the elections were held today i think rs would lose _meta_end_dot_

 that would make the senate functionally _meta_number_ref_d _meta_number_ref_r _meta_end_dot_

 i see no way for rs to have a majority in the senate this fall _meta_end_dot_

 house race summation takes longer than i have right now but cqpolitics map is a great place to start looking and it includes there rather accurate assessment of competitive and lean districts _meta_end_dot_

 rs have a lot of open seats in even to r _meta_number_ref_ districts _meta_end_dot_

 if we repeat _meta_number_ref_ rs will lose another _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ seats _meta_end_dot_

 if we repeat _meta_number_ref_ rs will hold a lot of marginal seats and win back a few but not enough to get the majority _meta_end_dot_

 i see no way for rs to have a majority in the house this fall _meta_end_dot_

 on a interesting to watch note there are ron paul republicans running in some rather hopeless districts i e _meta_end_dot_

 va _meta_number_ref_ moran nc _meta_number_ref_ price _meta_end_dot_

 it will be interesting to see if paul rs get more traction in arlington va and chapel hill nc than more traditional rs _meta_end_dot_

 if they post a good _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ points above the norm it may be an indication that an expansion of the big tent to include paul rs in certain places could help get the majority back _meta_end_dot_

 if they belly flop it might indicate that the internet is wildly unrepresentative of even odd places like college towns _meta_end_dot_

 pejman yousefzadeh i was basically going to write a shorter version of what adam wrote _meta_end_dot_

 senate races come most easily to mind with a special need to protect sununu and see if we can pick off landrieu as well _meta_end_dot_

 nm and co are huge _meta_end_dot_

 i basically think that va is a lost cause _meta_end_dot_

 i am hopeful that we will be able to protect coleman in mn _meta_end_dot_

 brad smith i hope people will also focus on house races _meta_end_dot_

 if the democrats pick up _meta_number_ref_ seats our guys will lose tremendous bargaining power and so will the handful of reasonably moderate democrats who are left _meta_end_dot_

 the left will ram whatever they want through the house _meta_end_dot_

 we can t count on the senate to filibuster everything _meta_end_dot_

 of course with so many house races most of us don t know what are the key races _meta_end_dot_

 that s why we need local reporting here at redstate on local races honest assessments not cheerleading reports _meta_end_dot_

 i ve recently noted a key race here in ohio to retain the seat of retiring rep _meta_end_dot_

 deborah pryce in ohio s _meta_number_ref_th cd _meta_end_dot_

 steve stivers a popular state senator is our candidate there _meta_end_dot_

 ohio has several other important races _meta_end_dot_

 ohio _meta_number_ref_ bob ney s old seat should be a gop district but it looks like we ve already blown it there and democrat zack space is now a prohibitive favorite _meta_end_dot_

 i hate to say it but the district is probably no longer worth the trouble in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 two other districts the _meta_number_ref_th held by democrat charlie wilson and the _meta_number_ref_th held by dennis kucinich could be competitive for gop challengers in the right year but they surely won t be this year _meta_end_dot_

 meanwhile ohio republicans will be struggling to hold on to a number of ohio seats _meta_end_dot_

 ohio s _meta_number_ref_th district has been held by republicans since _meta_number_ref_ and by ralph regula since _meta_number_ref_ but is in danger _meta_end_dot_

 regula is retiring _meta_end_dot_

 he has regularly held the district with _meta_percent_ref_ or more of the vote but it has trended slightly democratic and bush running far behind regula carried it _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ in _meta_number_ref_ and _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 republicans have a good candidate in state senator kirk schuring who grew up in and represents canton in the heart of the cd _meta_end_dot_

 but democratic state senator john boccieri and iraqi freedom vet has outraised schuring so far _meta_end_dot_

 the gop lean of the district should enable schuring to win but he needs funds _meta_end_dot_

 one can contribute to schuring here _meta_end_dot_

 republicans have another seat in jeopardy in ohio s _meta_number_ref_nd district which runs from the eastern cincinnati suburbs east through rural counties along the ohio river to portsmouth _meta_end_dot_

 this is another seat that has been republican for a long time since the _meta_number_ref_ election when bill gradison the incumbent in the neighboring _meta_number_ref_st cd but redistricted into the _meta_number_ref_nd defeated the democratic incumbent in an otherwise bad year for the gop _meta_end_dot_

 rob portman succeeded gradison and held the seat for a decade years before leaving to become u s _meta_end_dot_

 trade representative in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 in the special election state representative jean schmitt won a fractured primary with _meta_percent_ref_ of the vote then held off democrat netroots favorite paul hackett by fewer than _meta_number_ref_ votes to win the seat _meta_end_dot_

 in _meta_number_ref_ she scored another narrow primary victory and again squeaked through the general defeating victoria wulsin by fewer than _meta_number_ref_ votes _meta_end_dot_

 in the _meta_number_ref_ primary schmitt was attacked by the club for growth but she has supported the bush tax cuts repeal of estate taxes and a flat tax on income _meta_end_dot_

 she is strongly pro life _meta_end_dot_

 her congressional career and campaigns however have been marked by a number of missteps and she is not popular in much of the party _meta_end_dot_

 this will be another very tough race and wulsin back for round two is leading schmitt in the money race _meta_end_dot_

 you can contribute here _meta_end_dot_

 even if they hold the _meta_number_ref_th _meta_number_ref_th and _meta_number_ref_nd districts republicans still aren t out of the woods yet in ohio _meta_end_dot_

 in the _meta_number_ref_st cd consisting of cincinnati and its western and northern suburbs seven term incumbent steve chabot faces a tough race _meta_end_dot_

 chabot defeated john cranley just _meta_number_ref_ _meta_percent_ref_ in _meta_number_ref_ and four of his six re elections have come with less than _meta_percent_ref_ of the vote _meta_end_dot_

 the democratic nominee is state representative steven dreihaus a moderate and the dccc has pledged big bucks for the race _meta_end_dot_

 the first cd has a higher percentage of african american voters than any other district in the country currently held by a republican so if obama in particular is the democratic presidential nominee that could spell trouble unless rob portman is the gop vp nominee _meta_end_dot_

 still my gut is that chabot should be ok right now schmitt schuring and stivers probably need money more but if this turns into another big democratic year come september it may be chabot s seat we are desperately trying to save _meta_end_dot_

 a contribution now may help head off that possibility _meta_end_dot_

 chabot s campaign site is here _meta_end_dot_

 rob portman by the way has been mentioned as a possible veep choice for mccain _meta_end_dot_

 portman is not known nationally but he has some big chits in favor notably giving mccain a boost in crucial ohio and probably assuring that we keep the congressional seats now held by schmitt and chabot and maybe of the retiring pryce and regula as well _meta_end_dot_

 four house seats and a big boost in a key presidential state is a pretty good starting point for a veep and portman is intelligent experienced and respected on both sides of the aisle your sleeper veep pick _meta_end_dot_
