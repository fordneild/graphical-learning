  now that the bush administration has made clear the need for a free trade deal with colombia one that opens colombian markets to american products the reverse is already true and one that demonstrates solidarity with colombia in the wake of the country s recent military spat with venezuela i suppose it is only predictable that we have this the first stimulus package was a bad enough idea _meta_end_dot_

 now we are going to go ahead and have a second one immediately after the first one _meta_end_question_

 and we are going to hold up a free trade deal that could actually work to do it _meta_end_question_

 let s all recall that one of the few bright spots of our economy is the export market _meta_end_dot_

 indeed american exports have basically helped keep the economy from completely sinking and if we have a mild recession we will have exports to thank for its mildness _meta_end_dot_

 now with a chance to expand the export market still further remember the trade deal between colombia and the united states will open colombian markets to american goods the speaker of the house has basically decided to say no thanks and shoot the american economy in the foot _meta_end_dot_

 what do we do next _meta_end_question_

 have a national let s all down a couple shots of hemlock day _meta_end_question_

 a couple of speaker pelosi s friends may well be on board with the spirit behind the proposition if not the proposition itself _meta_end_dot_
