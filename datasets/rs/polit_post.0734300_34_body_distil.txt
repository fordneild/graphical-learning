  i m amazed that national review published the following by jason lee steorts utterly necessary analysis below the fold _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 steorts provides us with his thought experiment as a kind of so there to christians who find mormonism unbelievable _meta_end_dot_

 i would suggest that mr _meta_end_dot_

 steorts has put his question forward in a way that misses the most important parts of why christians believe what they do _meta_end_dot_

 first off don t be offended christians think that every religion other than judaism is completely unfounded _meta_end_dot_

 the christian faith makes exclusive claims _meta_end_dot_

 let s avoid the side issues and go to the central feature _meta_end_dot_

 christians believe their faith for one simple at least somewhat rationalistic reason _meta_end_dot_

 they think that jesus really did rise from the dead _meta_end_dot_

 there are evidences that explain why christians think it happened _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 the historical existence of jesus and his crucifixion by the roman empire are not seriously disputed _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 something significant happened to alter the behavior of his disciples after his death _meta_end_dot_

 they were quivering jello before he died _meta_end_dot_

 afterward they went out and established the christian church at the price of persecution and death _meta_end_dot_

 how to account for this transformation if he was just rotting in the ground and that was it _meta_end_question_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 contemporaneously to the period when jesus was killed paul boldly claimed that the resurrected christ had been seen by many witnesses _meta_number_ref_ corinthians _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ referencing some _meta_number_ref_ witnesses _meta_end_dot_

 why put that out there if easily disproven _meta_end_question_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 if paul were lying about the witnesses then no one would pay any attention to him and the cult would fail as did virtually all others _meta_end_dot_

 instead the church grew at a startling rate despite the fact of intense persecution that grew with time _meta_end_dot_

 we could go on in this fashion _meta_end_dot_

 i don t claim that this constitutes a bullet proof case for the resurrection of christ and the truth of the christian religion but i do claim that it provides some basis for a rational belief _meta_end_dot_

 at the same time i claim that mormonism islam and a number of other faiths cannot hope to rise to anything like this level of evidence _meta_end_dot_

 in short the christian faith was based on a claimed fact that could theoretically be proven false _meta_end_dot_

 that is not the case with mormonism _meta_end_dot_

 steorts makes a mistake in conflating the two as though they occupy similar ground with respect to reason _meta_end_dot_
