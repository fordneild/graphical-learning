  in the event that people think the debate over free trade is smallball in this election cycle let me note that in fact the issue is attracting a whole lot of attention and for all of the correct reasons what we do in terms of formulating and implementing trade policy will have a tremendous impact on our economic growth or lack thereof _meta_end_dot_

 to that end i want to direct reader attention to this and this both of which show that trade policy is going to be a special focus of attention for the gop come this fall _meta_end_dot_

 this is a good thing republicans are not backing down in the face of protectionist demagoguery _meta_end_dot_

 quite the contrary a pro growth pro free market pro opportunity message is being spread that is in the best traditions of the republican party _meta_end_dot_

 i don t feel like being reminded of smoot hawley _meta_end_dot_

 i know that you don t either _meta_end_dot_

 and if we work hard enough in this upcoming election cycle we won t be _meta_end_dot_
