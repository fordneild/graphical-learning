  barring a shocking turn of events barack obama will effectively seal the nomination of the democratic party on march _meta_number_ref_th _meta_end_dot_

 while hillary clinton may still pull off victories in ohio and texas she would have to win by large margins to have a realistic path to victory which seems unlikely given the increasingly desperate nature of her on trail performance and a growing impression that her moment of opportunity has passed if it ever existed _meta_end_dot_

 republicans are now confronted with a democratic candidate who as fred barnes has pointed out is a candidate of a consensus party for the first time in more than a generation _meta_end_dot_

 with a delicate coalition that must come together around the controversial john mccain in order to win the odds are strongly against the gop in november _meta_end_dot_

 but should they be _meta_end_question_

 as we all know by now obama comes equipped with many innate gifts that make him the most appealing and pop culturally significant democratic candidate since john f _meta_end_dot_

 kennedy _meta_end_dot_

 as recently as six months ago i believed it was impossible for anyone other than mccain to have any hope of beating the young illinois senator _meta_end_dot_

 yet the primary results led me to reevaluate my opinion and i now believe that obama presents not just an inherently flawed candidacy but a kamikaze leftist candidate whose out of step views will not last the duration of a general election without full exposure and whose mawkish storytelling can t carry him to the white house without some serious good fortune _meta_end_dot_

 read on then for the top ten reasons republicans should not be afraid of obama in a general election _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 no mcgovern has ever won the democratic party has a long history of choosing candidates whose liberal views and ability to inspire their upper class white and lower class worker voting base make them ideally suited for caucuses and primaries and terribly suited for general elections _meta_end_dot_

 they ve proven that they can win when they choose triangulating centrist southern candidates like jimmy carter in _meta_number_ref_ and bill clinton in _meta_number_ref_ but candidates like mcgovern mondale and dukakis all went down in the general _meta_end_dot_

 while obama is certainly a more inspiring figure than dukakis it s worth remembering that the massachusetts governor emerged from the dnc convention with a _meta_number_ref_ point lead in _meta_number_ref_ in large part because george h w _meta_end_dot_

 bush was a known quantity while dukakis was a bright unknown immigrant talking about change _meta_end_dot_

 one wonders whether obama will be smart enough to avoid any tank incidents since the modern equivalent would get six million views on youtube in short order _meta_end_dot_

 in the end the historical path just isn t there a fact which makes a win not impossible but less likely _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 latinos barack obama has yet to prove that he can perform well or even consistently compete for latino voters who have been a key swing bloc in past elections _meta_end_dot_

 mccain is the best candidate out of the republican field in terms of performance among voting latinos he has a long history of winning them in arizona and a good deal of cachet among the community and obama will have to overcome significant racial divides to compete among them which is one of the reasons he has a distinct disadvantage in point _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 new map is better for mccain a mccain obama contest effectively throws out the bush _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ maps _meta_end_dot_

 the battlegrounds shift and in nearly every case they shift in a way that plays to republican advantages _meta_end_dot_

 obama has raised money with an ease unlike any candidate in american political history even george washington had to buy scads of alcohol to cater his first campaign but he will have to spend a large amount of those resources in traditional democrat states to shore up his base after a divisive primary _meta_end_dot_

 on the other hand mccain will run strong in states like pennsylvania and ohio and he is already running even with obama in western states like new mexico thanks in large part to latinos and another key bloc which leads us to a fourth point _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 veterans the so called older belligerent men vote that granted mccain his come from behind victory is in large part a result of emphatic overwhelming support from veterans and military families _meta_end_dot_

 this is no kerry bush race where veterans could be split mccain s loyalty runs so deep he wins both anti war and pro war vets _meta_end_dot_

 yes turnout for african americans will be at its highest point ever with an obama candidacy but on the other side strong veteran communities plus latino voters will enable mccain to realistically compete in states like california which a republican presidential candidate hasn t had a shot at since _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 it s notable that obama couldn t pass clinton there despite his fundraising prowess in the state but in the end it s less important that mccain actually wins in the golden state than it is that he keeps obama s resources tied up there allowing for gains in other contests _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 single issues matter this time on several hot button issues barack obama has views that are considerably to the left of both kerry in _meta_number_ref_ and gore in _meta_number_ref_ and unlike those two candidates his views have yet to be exposed on the national stage _meta_end_dot_

 take this recent column from stu rothenberg on obama s gun problems emphasis added this isn t just leftism it s incoherent leftism _meta_end_dot_

 the idea that reasonable thoughtful gun control is somehow not taking away folks guns might fly now but just won t play after every gun toting middle and lower class white male in the midwest has heard about it _meta_end_dot_

 gore essentially ran as a pro gun candidate in _meta_number_ref_ and even kerry tried to soft pedal the gun issue but obama simply can t any more than he can soft pedal his views on partial birth abortion and other associated issues _meta_end_dot_

 leading pro lifer gary bauer recently sent an email to supporters pointing out that obama gains roughly _meta_number_ref_ percentage points over hillary clinton among pro lifers in states like wisconsin iowa and virginia _meta_end_dot_

 some may view this as a problem but in reality it s a huge opportunity for republicans to completely define a candidate who struggles to define even his own positions on the matter _meta_end_dot_

 as we saw with rudy giuliani this cycle when ignorance ends on a candidate s views on life the percentages swing _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 weakness among typical democrat voting blocs obama s success among groups like the young professionals wealthy whites and poor blacks have been unsurprising but he s been less consistent with a key demographic that he needs to win in november union voters _meta_end_dot_

 while i don t think there s any question obama will ultimately win them over doing so is going to take more sustained outreach and more attacks along the lines of his anti nafta assault last week _meta_end_dot_

 and even after endorsements from the teamsters and others there s a strong undercurrent of union voters who are unenthusiastic about a candidate they view as a weak advocate on their issues and fundamentally out of step with their experience _meta_end_dot_

 you need only look at this recent rant by tom buffenburger of the machinists union to see the problem reaching out to union voters is going to force obama to take more divisive anti free market positions ones that mccain can absolutely exploit _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 the new southern strategy while gov _meta_end_dot_

 ed rendell s controversial comments about racial politics don t reflect the situation in most states if anything this cycle has revealed it s more a problem in new england than in the south not even the kennedys could deliver massachusetts for obama they do reveal another problem for obama _meta_end_dot_

 he s won throughout the primary season by having enormous turnout from african american voters in places like south carolina where they made up half the voting electorate at the polls _meta_end_dot_

 it s not going to be like this in the general _meta_end_dot_

 in fact obama has only won the votes of white democrats in a total of two state primaries illinois his home state and new mexico _meta_end_dot_

 there is not one southern state where obama did not have the advantage in a democratic primary and not one southern state where obama has the advantage going into the a general election _meta_end_dot_

 he must expand his base in the south in order to hope to win and efforts to do that will be stymied without moving right on several issues issues like guns marriage and immigration all areas he can t afford to move on _meta_end_dot_

 and how many incidents of rank racial politics of the sort sean wilentz no conservative he details here have the potential to backfire in a general _meta_end_question_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 the experience gap this race has the widest experience gap since wendell willkie took on fdr in _meta_number_ref_ never having held elective office _meta_end_dot_

 while many members of the mainstream media are eager to make obama jfk comparisons younger voters may forget that the war hero kennedy had spend _meta_number_ref_ years in congress and the senate by the time he ran for president _meta_end_dot_

 obama s inexperience and naivete have already revealed themselves in small moments when it comes to foreign affairs and this is obviously mccain s strength _meta_end_dot_

 as i noted earlier mccain s maverick tendencies are so ingrained that he wins independents and moderates who oppose the war as well as those who support it and believe it was poorly waged _meta_end_dot_

 if this election is about pop culture and style obama wins if it s about who is best suited to be commander in chief mccain wins _meta_end_dot_

 in one of politics little ironies the democrats now have to hope that the surge in iraq is so successful over the coming months that iraq is essentially a non issue if foreign policy is a priority either way it plays to mccain s advantages _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 the barack obama is my shiny new bicycle the building a religion cult of personality that has grown up around obama has certainly propelled much of his success and fundraising _meta_end_dot_

 but anecdotal evidence suggests it s now reached a point where it s genuinely off putting to some voters certainly if it s reached the point where hillary clinton herself is mocking it _meta_end_dot_

 think john edwards christopher reeve will walk again but only if you vote for kerry edwards comment in _meta_number_ref_ but maximize it as the note hit by an entire campaign s following _meta_end_dot_

 as anyone in hollywood can tell you all it takes is a few tmz segments and one day you go from being hannah montana to being britney spears _meta_end_dot_

 this is the kind of obama s made voting chic strategy that draws in susceptible young voters but has massive potential to backfire in a general election where true believers are outnumbered and where a political novice is pitted not against a sluggish partisan candidate like hillary but an experienced campaigner who s proven he wins independent voters consistently _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 even if he wins it s not over let s assume for the sake of argument that none of the previous eight factors break obama s way _meta_end_dot_

 say the republicans don t come together and he wins a narrow election over mccain winning states like missouri holding onto california and carrying ohio and pennsylvania _meta_end_dot_

 now the hard part begins for the political left how do you govern successfully as a liberal in the white house _meta_end_question_

 how do you actually make this thing work _meta_end_question_

 it s not going to be easy to pull off great society redux and post partisanship at the same time particularly if hillary is majority leader as some expect _meta_end_dot_

 the problem for democrats is that obama is so unique so fresh and new and those he surrounds himself with aren t _meta_end_dot_

 they don t have the farm team to support him in office just the tired old partisan lions of big government and scandal known quantities all _meta_end_dot_

 if obama is elected his presidency may ultimately resemble jimmy carter s a candidate who convinced voters that he was nice and good and then discovered that these good intentions just weren t enough to actually run the country for four years _meta_end_dot_

 the basic rule of branding still holds here once you get the candidate out of the box regardless of how good the branding is it still has to work _meta_end_dot_
