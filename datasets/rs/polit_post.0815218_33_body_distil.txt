  michigan and florida two states who violated democrat party rules and moved their primaries up to the beginning of this year in order to gain nominating relevance did become extremely relevant however in a supreme case of electoral irony the nomination battle between sens _meta_end_dot_

 clinton and obama has gone on for so long this year that both michigan and florida along with pennsylvania oregon west virginia kentucky and so many more are and would have been relevant to the nominating process anyway _meta_end_dot_

 we are being reminded of that relevance yet again today as the democratic party is making its latest attempt to solve its michigan and florida problem without a giving the nomination to the wrong person thereby sparking an irreconcilable intraparty war in the run up to november s general election b rewarding state parties who willfully flaunted their breaking of dnc figurehead howard dean s primary date rules and c alienating two of the most important states to democrats in this entire election _meta_end_dot_

 the compromises being put forward included a proposal by the clinton camp of course to seat all _meta_number_ref_ of florida s human and super delegates _meta_end_dot_

 obama superdelegate rep _meta_end_dot_

 robert wexler d fl responded to this with what he called an extraordinary concession in order to promote reconciliation with florida s voters the seating of half of his own state s delegates _meta_end_dot_

 sounds like a recipe for half reconciliation to me but then again i m neither a floridian nor a democrat for all i know they may appreciate things being done half way down there at least in wexler s district _meta_end_dot_

 we have suffered horribly said jon ausman a florida superdelegate whose failings whatever they may be clearly do not include a lack of perspective _meta_end_dot_

 ausman recommended that the rules committee give all his state s superdelegates a full vote at the convention and grant one half vote to the rest in keeping with the longstanding democrat principle that all votes are equal and should be counted but that some votes such as the supers vs _meta_end_dot_

 the humans are more equal than others and that others even when counted don t necessarily count _meta_end_dot_

 moments later sen _meta_end_dot_

 bill nelson of florida a clinton supporter urged a full vote for all _meta_number_ref_ of the state s delegates _meta_end_dot_

 he said nearly two million democrats voted in the disputed primary adding that they violated no rule _meta_end_dot_

 yet they are the ones who would be unfairly punished _meta_end_dot_

 and they do not deserve punishment unfortunately for mr _meta_end_dot_

 nelson mr _meta_end_dot_

 ausman and the millions of florida democrats who are likely still scratching their heads at the looming reality of their own disenfranchisement in an election that didn t even involve republicans somebody to paraphrase harvey keitel s character in the film national treasure has to be punished _meta_end_dot_

 that person or those people will either be sen _meta_end_dot_

 obama sen _meta_end_dot_

 clinton along with the legions of their respective supporters the poor michigan and florida democrats who just wanted to go to the polls to vote for their chosen successor to that dastardly bush should he actually abdicate in january something i really don t think some of them believe even to this day or the parties of those states who did follow the rules and not move their primaries up _meta_end_dot_

 we have both fought hard throughout the country both of us for delegates and the fact that we re willing to essentially cede her delegates auth _meta_end_dot_

 note which she won we do not think is an insignificant gesture on our part said obama campaign manager david plouffe _meta_end_dot_

 but we re willing to do this in the interest of trying to bring this to a close so we can focus on the general election in other news obama s campaign manager is still named plouffe and the democratic party s spring now summer of pain continues with no end in sight _meta_end_dot_
