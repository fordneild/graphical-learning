  the actual news that came out of yesterday in maryland i don t think anybody was actually surprised at the presidential primary results on either side involved a couple of cds the rest of the story is readable enough you ll grin at a newspaper actually identifying a progressive group as progressive for a change but that s the meat of it _meta_end_dot_

 what it all means is another story entirely _meta_end_dot_

 read on _meta_end_dot_

 first off congratulations to soon to be rep _meta_end_dot_

 donna edwards it is merely a hand madam you will not be infected with neo conservatism by shaking it and soon to be rep _meta_end_dot_

 andy harris _meta_end_dot_

 nice job on both your parts it s not easy to successfully challenge an incumbent in the primary so well done _meta_end_dot_

 get used to being paired together by the way we re not used to two successful challenges in the same state so the media will probably talk about both of you at the same time for a while _meta_end_dot_

 heh _meta_end_dot_

 edwards harris _meta_end_dot_

 ed harris _meta_end_dot_

 oh never mind _meta_end_dot_

 second to the netroots congratulations and thanks _meta_end_exclamation_

 the congratulations are for being able to successfully replace a popular moderate democrat with a more progressive one in a seat that is almost assuredly going to stay democrat after november _meta_end_dot_

 the thanks are for exactly the same thing you ve also replaced an experienced moderate democrat with a reputation for reaching out across the aisle with an inexperienced partisan democrat who probably won t for a few years at least _meta_end_dot_

 we were scratching our heads over whether or not wynn losing his seat was a bad thing anyway nice to have that resolved for us _meta_end_dot_

 besides we re ahead on points _meta_end_dot_

 losing gilchrest is going to be worse for the antiwar movement than keeping wynn would have been the latter was toeing their line however reluctantly while the former was cheerfully crossing it _meta_end_dot_

 and now he s gone and he ll be replaced with a reaganite who understands the need for strong national security and the folks over in agitprop have lost a convenient responsible republican to play spin games with _meta_end_dot_

 mind you optimal probably would have been to keep wynn and lose gilchrest but we ll take this thanks _meta_end_dot_

 moe not to mention one that s still carrying a torch for john edwards whose conventionally progressive campaign went precisely nowhere and stayed there but that s a different issue _meta_end_dot_
