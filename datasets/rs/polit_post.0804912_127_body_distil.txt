  by and large the online left hates obama _meta_end_dot_

 it s one of the underreported ironies of this political season _meta_end_dot_

 obama has more in common with the netroots than hillary _meta_end_dot_

 he s to the left of her on the war on corporate issues on social welfare issues even on life issues obama appears to the left of hillary _meta_end_dot_

 but the online left does not like him _meta_end_dot_

 there are a few reasons for this _meta_end_dot_

 for one obama is no ned lamont _meta_end_dot_

 he s a dazzling rising star of the left but unlike lamont obama is not a product of the online left _meta_end_dot_

 he has in fact done it on his own _meta_end_dot_

 obama has had a brilliant online operation _meta_end_dot_

 his online fundraising was dean esque without joe trippi s involvement _meta_end_dot_

 his website and web _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ strategy has been dazzling without jerome armstrong s involvement _meta_end_dot_

 his ability to get people fired up and directed in a particular direction has been stellar without kos s involvement _meta_end_dot_

 in fact obama s relations with bloggers have been frosty and he hasn t spent much time stroking their egos _meta_end_dot_

 obama is by and large a testament that the online movement remains ancillary to the cause _meta_end_dot_

 there is another reason too and one we should pay attention to _meta_end_dot_

 read on _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 the online left is interested more than anything else in the accumulation of power in their hands _meta_end_dot_

 the shallowness of obama on policy issues is right at home with this but obama actually tries to play to the center _meta_end_dot_

 he talks too nicely about bipartisanship _meta_end_dot_

 the same argument the right frequently makes in criticizing mccain that he s too eager to work across the aisle is also a criticism the left has of obama _meta_end_dot_

 in other words whether you realize it or not the online left has been in bed with hillary clinton for a good long while and they have a vested interest in defeating obama _meta_end_dot_

 if obama is defeated they can maintain the fiction a little longer that the online movement is a vital part of the cause _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ let s look at a few of their recent arguments first the online left is beginning to agitate for michigan and florida to be seated at the convention _meta_end_dot_

 this does nothing but help hillary _meta_end_dot_

 it s also based on shoddy thinking _meta_end_dot_

 and this should be a lot of fun _meta_end_dot_

 it puts the online left in bed with jesse jackson and against al sharpton _meta_end_dot_

 it also puts them against the bulk of black voters within the democratic party _meta_end_dot_

 but considering the demographics of the online left that shouldn t be too surprising _meta_end_dot_

 second the online left has decided that obama is wait for it too far left to win _meta_end_dot_

 he is they argue george mcgovern _meta_end_dot_

 this is actually the best argument given obama s total failure to win in swing states and primaries he is the mike huckabee of the democratic party needing caucuses to win _meta_end_dot_

 i suspect it ll also be the argument we hear them push more and more _meta_end_dot_

 lastly and some of you will totally get the irony in this one others won t armando is accusing obama of being sexist and misogynist _meta_end_dot_

 why _meta_end_question_

 because obama said of hillary s attacks unfortunately for the left time is running out _meta_end_dot_

 obama is winning _meta_end_dot_

 he is advancing _meta_end_dot_

 they are going to have to unleash hell on obama now to hurt him _meta_end_dot_

 and they are going to have to pressure superdelegates to go with hillary despite obama thus far getting the popular vote _meta_end_dot_

 i wonder if al gore will support that argument _meta_end_dot_

 many republicans including me have thought all along that we were screwed this year _meta_end_dot_

 more and more it s looking like the democrats may rescue us from our hopelessness and screw themselves in the process _meta_end_dot_

 we should continue to root for the ned lamont left online left _meta_end_dot_
