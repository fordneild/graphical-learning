  i am not going to mince words _meta_end_dot_

 i don t care for john hagee the senior pastor of cornerstone church in san antonio texas _meta_end_dot_

 i realize this may offend some of redstate s evangelical readers but that s certainly not my intent and i hope they will at the very least understand why a faithful catholic might take offense at someone referring to his beloved church as the great whore an apostate church the anti christ and a false cult system see also this video of hagee spewing his anti catholic nonsense _meta_end_dot_

 so needless to say i wasn t exactly thrilled when senator john mccain who i strongly support announced that he was very honored by hagee s endorsement _meta_end_dot_

 it disturbed me greatly when governor huckabee associated himself with hagee by speaking to his church and it bothered me as much if not more when mccain publicly embraced this joker _meta_end_dot_

 that having been said let s consider the facts _meta_end_dot_

 senator mccain strongly repudiated hagee s anti catholic views not once but twice now that may not be good enough for the dems but i think it is a damn fine statement by the good senator certainly much more forceful than governor huckabee s comments when he was confronted about hagee s views _meta_end_dot_

 to be sure i would rather mccain completely disassociate himself from hagee but his failure to do so no doubt as a matter of political prudence is not nearly enough for me to sit out an election that may among other things decide who gets to fill as many as three supreme court vacancies in the next four years _meta_end_dot_

 i mean seriously do the dems really believe that faithful catholics are just going to sit on the sidelines this november because one of mccain s high profile supporters is a bigoted twit _meta_end_question_

 do they honestly think that this sort of thing matters more than senator obama s unwillingness to support legislation designed to provide basic medical care to babies who survive botched abortions _meta_end_question_

 the bottom line is this on the non negotiable teachings of the catholic church senator mccain is the clear choice for faithful catholics even with his deeply troubling support of federal funding for embryonic stem cell research _meta_end_dot_

 and no amount of jeering by dems over hagee s endorsement of mccain is going to change this fact _meta_end_dot_

 besides i would think obama and clinton supporters have plenty of other things to be concerned about _meta_end_dot_
