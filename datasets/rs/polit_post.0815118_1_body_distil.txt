  here is some interesting as well as character confirming info about one of barack obama s former runs for office _meta_end_dot_

 apparently obama actively sought and received the stamp of approval of a marxist third party that operated briefly in chicago between _meta_number_ref_ and _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 the group was called the new party and was started in _meta_number_ref_ by daniel cantor a former staffer for jesse jackson s _meta_number_ref_ presidential campaign and joel rogers a sociology and law professor at the university of wisconsin madison _meta_end_dot_

 this news pretty much confirms that barack obama is at the very least a neo marxist and also confirms the claim that he is one of the most far left leaning senators we have in office today _meta_end_dot_

 this man is no new politician no centrist and not interested in ever reaching across the aisle this whole new way line of bunkum is all smoke a mirrors _meta_end_dot_
