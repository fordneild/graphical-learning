  the washington post reports that hillary clinton has finally decided to embrace her husband s legacy in her run for the presidency _meta_end_dot_

 among the reasons for this earthshaking tactical decision is the following free trade _meta_end_dot_

 there are few more reliable routes to economic prosperity than trade liberalization and to bill clinton s credit he recognized and acted on that fact when he was president _meta_end_dot_

 too bad both clintons have backtracked from that stance in the effort to elect hillary clinton president _meta_end_dot_

 power should never be achieved as a goal in and of itself _meta_end_dot_

 it should be achieved in the service of more noble efforts _meta_end_dot_

 whether the clintons have adopted their new trade stance because of expediency the most likely possibility or because they suddenly genuinely believe in protectionism their stance on trade does them no honor _meta_end_dot_

 and if implemented it would do the country a lot of harm _meta_end_dot_
