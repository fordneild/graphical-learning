  for most of this primary election season i have found myself very sympathetic to the arguments expressed here _meta_end_dot_

 national security is certainly a prevailing concern in this presidential election more so probably even than in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 but just as central to this election from a republican party perspective is the nature of the party in the post bush era _meta_end_dot_

 if republicans want the party to remain a majority party as i believe it still is they must remain true to the conservative principles upon which five of the last seven presidential elections have been won _meta_end_dot_

 there is only one candidate running that has demonstrated a consistent dedication to conservative principles of federalism smaller government family values the rule of law and the proper exercise of the role of the three branches of government _meta_end_dot_

 that candidate is sen _meta_end_dot_

 fred thompson and i am proud to offer my endorsement of his campaign _meta_end_dot_

 read on in fairness i should point out that i believe thompson s campaign has made some fundamental errors in strategy and i do generally agree with the proposition that the operation of a candidate s campaign is a good indicator of how his administration would run _meta_end_dot_

 however this campaign should not be about electing the smoothest political operator nor should it be a test of personal ambition _meta_end_dot_

 campaigns are about ideas and a willingness to engage issues based on sound principles _meta_end_dot_

 candidates owe the voters a look at their ideas and a defense of them not necessarily a whirlwind swing through _meta_number_ref_ states in _meta_number_ref_ days _meta_end_dot_

 sen _meta_end_dot_

 thompson has been the most specific candidate on the issues of anyone running for president republican or democrat _meta_end_dot_

 while most of the others speak in generalities vague commitments and platitudes thompson issues plans _meta_end_dot_

 his willingness to address issues like entitlement reform with specific proposals rooted in conservative principles finds no equal among the republicans _meta_end_dot_

 on taxes too thompson goes beyond simply embracing popular brand name fixes and populist rhetoric _meta_end_dot_

 he puts forth a detailed solution that demonstrates a serious study of the federal tax code and incorporates both a bold new approach and a faithfulness to past actions that have worked _meta_end_dot_

 on social issues sen _meta_end_dot_

 thompson holds unashamedly conservative views as well _meta_end_dot_

 he has received the endorsement of the national right to life committee and various state life groups _meta_end_dot_

 he supports adult stem cell research and opposes human cloning and embryo destroying stem cell research _meta_end_dot_

 thompson had a _meta_percent_ref_ pro life voting record in the senate and believes that roe v _meta_end_dot_

 wade was wrongly decided and should be overturned _meta_end_dot_

 thompson supports a federalist approach to abortion in which each state would regulate the practice as its citizens see fit _meta_end_dot_

 on same sex marriage thompson believes that marriage is between a man and a woman and most importantly that judges should not set about changing that by judicial fiat _meta_end_dot_

 he supports a constitutional amendment to prevent judges from misinterpreting the constitution to allow for the practice _meta_end_dot_

 sen _meta_end_dot_

 thompson is a staunch supporter of the second amendment and has received an a rating from the national rifle association _meta_end_dot_

 he has been the most consistent republican candidate in talking about the need to appoint judges that recognize their proper role in government _meta_end_dot_

 lastly on what i believe will be the two major issues of the presidential campaign national security and illegal immigration thompson has issued positions that are both comprehensive and specific _meta_end_dot_

 on defense thompson supports increasing the military budget to _meta_number_ref_ _meta_percent_ref_ of gdp _meta_end_dot_

 he wants to increase the size of the army and marine corps to a combined one million men as well as increase the size of the navy s fleet to at least _meta_number_ref_ ships _meta_end_dot_

 he believes in the missions in iraq and afghanistan and recognizes that remaining on offense in the war on terror is the best way to defeat the enemy as well as secure the homeland against attack _meta_end_dot_

 on illegal immigration thompson goes beyond all of the major candidates by supporting the completion of the _meta_number_ref_ mile long border fence authorized in the secure fence act and supporting efforts at reducing the number of illegal immigrants already in the country _meta_end_dot_

 thompson believes in attrition through enforcement and removal of the jobs incentive _meta_end_dot_

 he labels as a false choice the belief that there must be either a guest worker program or massive deportations _meta_end_dot_

 thompson supports increased interior enforcement including committing the resources necessary to the task employer verification increased use of a federally authorized expedited removal process sharing of information between the social security administration and federal law enforcement and cutting off discretionary funding to cities with sanctuary policies _meta_end_dot_

 on both issues thompson is confident in his principles and unapologetic in his plans _meta_end_dot_

 equally important to the issues is the candidate s willingness to stand firm for the principles that support his positions _meta_end_dot_

 part and parcel of this is having the courage to call the opposition what it is and not bend to criticism from the elite _meta_end_dot_

 too often republicans have sought compromise with democrats in the name of bi partisanship _meta_end_dot_

 the problem with this approach is that for democrats compromise means that republicans abandon their principles _meta_end_dot_

 thompson has shown that he has the courage to call democrats out for what they have become and has called upon democrats who feel that their party has abandoned them to join with him _meta_end_dot_

 i believe that this strategy will be as effective in the general election this year as it was in _meta_number_ref_ and _meta_number_ref_ when disaffected democrats helped give president ronald reagan two terms _meta_end_dot_

 marginally democratic states like michigan pennsylvania minnesota and wisconsin could be put in play with a consistent appeal to moderate democrats based on sound conservative principles _meta_end_dot_

 sen _meta_end_dot_

 thompson s closing appeal to iowa voters demonstrates his ability to effectively communicate conservative principles and reach out to broaden the republican party s base _meta_end_dot_

 passage in which sen _meta_end_dot_

 thompson discusses the nature of the modern day democratic party _meta_end_dot_

 the other candidates all have appealing qualities and any of them would be preferable to a democratic administration _meta_end_dot_

 but sen _meta_end_dot_

 thompson is the most ideologically pure republican running _meta_end_dot_

 i believe that will translate well into electability in the general election _meta_end_dot_

 it will also serve the republican party well in the aftermath of a presidency of qualified compassionate conservatism and place the party back on a path of advancing winning conservative principles _meta_end_dot_

 elections are about ideas _meta_end_dot_

 sen _meta_end_dot_

 fred thompson has stood far and away ahead of the other candidates in this primary season in terms of putting forth his ideas rooted in conservatism and showing the courage and willingness to defend them _meta_end_dot_

 he knows who he is and what he believes _meta_end_dot_

 just as importantly he knows who the opposition is and what it believes and is willing to challenge democrats on the strength of their ideas _meta_end_dot_

 sen _meta_end_dot_

 thompson realizes that conservative values are mainstream american values and he believes he can increase the appeal of the republican party with a platform based on those principles _meta_end_dot_

 he cares little for the opinions of the coastal elite or the inside the beltway crowd focusing instead on achieving results through tested conservative initiatives _meta_end_dot_

 it is for all these reasons that i am supporting sen _meta_end_dot_

 fred thompson in the republican primaries _meta_end_dot_

 i hope you will consider joining me _meta_end_dot_
