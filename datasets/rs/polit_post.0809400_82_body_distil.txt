  while we wait for definitive word regarding the presidency of zimbabwe we can at least rejoice in knowing that robert mugabe s party has lost its majority in the lower house of parliament _meta_end_dot_

 it should be clear of course that mugabe has lost the presidency as well _meta_end_dot_

 but his government is maintaining an eerie silence regarding the matter which raises fears that mugabe will try to pull some sort of election stealing effort _meta_end_dot_

 people should be encouraged by what is happening now in zimbabwe _meta_end_dot_

 but no one should write mugabe off just yet _meta_end_dot_

 it may be that he wants the nightmare his country is experiencing to go on even longer _meta_end_dot_
