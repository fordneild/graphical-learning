  update oh is somebody embarrassed now _meta_end_question_

 further update after thinking about it for a bit i ve actually changed my mind on this _meta_end_dot_

 that text was probably just cut and pasted from the original version of the speech the people who did that probably didn t even notice that their version of the text didn t include obama s oopsie _meta_end_dot_

 said explanations usually involved allegations of drug use general lack of intelligence bad programming or _meta_end_dot_

 no actually that pretty much covers it depressingly _meta_end_dot_

 the point is there seems to be a definite interest out there for telling me the nefarious reasons for bush s patterns of speech _meta_end_dot_

 sobeit _meta_end_dot_

 since this is an acceptable topic what s senator obama s excuse then _meta_end_question_

 glenn goes on to mention the deliberate stupidities in that particular speech as opposed to the apparently accidental one noted above _meta_end_dot_

 personally i prefer to contemplate the thought that this was actually deliberate and that obama s going after the zombie vote _meta_end_dot_

 he s from chicago after all politicians from that city are quite used to getting the dead to the polls _meta_end_dot_

 moe lane for a group of people that pride themselves on their cleverness progressives aren t actually all that good at insults _meta_end_dot_

 the average one seems to have at most five _meta_end_dot_
