  when i am not blogging here or at my personal blog southern appeal i occasionally blog at another group blog vox nova dedicated to addressing various and sundry catholic issues _meta_end_dot_

 i think it is fair to say that vox nova is a left leaning blog but to my co bloggers credit they invited me on to provide a different more conservative perspective _meta_end_dot_

 well recently there was some discussion at vox nova over reverend wright s disgraceful comments about our great republic with several commenters defending those vile statements along with a few of my co bloggers _meta_end_dot_

 and it will come as no surprise to y all that many of these folks are also big time obama supporters _meta_end_dot_

 so i thought to myself i wonder what would happen if i published a simple post with an image of the american flag and the lyrics to god bless america and nothing more _meta_end_dot_

 well the result is nothing short of remarkable and it is hardly atypical _meta_end_dot_

 these folks really loathe their own country _meta_end_dot_

 this is nothing new of course but it always amazes me when i see it up close and personal _meta_end_dot_

 update three of my co bloggers at vox nova nate policraticus and morning s minion have prepared posts in response to my god bless america post which i commend to y all for different perspectives on this issue _meta_end_dot_
