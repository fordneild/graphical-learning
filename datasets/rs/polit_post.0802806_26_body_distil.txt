  update at the end i can understand why john mccain would want to question mitt romney s credentials on iraq and the current strategy _meta_end_dot_

 the race in florida is too close to call and romney has been doing better recently _meta_end_dot_

 you could even say that in the last week or so romney has finally found his own voice _meta_end_dot_

 romney is less well versed on national security matters than mccain so of course mccain wants to focus on issues such as iraq and the war against militant islamism _meta_end_dot_

 i m sure mccain also went after romney because there is no love lost between the two candidates especially after romney launched negative and misleading attack ads all over new hampshire _meta_end_dot_

 more below the fold _meta_end_dot_

 personally i have no problem with negative ads and negative statements so long as the charges are accurate _meta_end_dot_

 so the bottom line question is did mccain s statement about romney s secret timetables meet the standard of accuracy _meta_end_question_

 i don t think so but it s hard to tell because romney s comments last april were so vague and hedging and incoherent that he opened himself up to interpretation and criticism _meta_end_dot_

 when robin roberts asked romney do you believe that there should be a timetable in withdrawing the troops romney gave a strange answer _meta_end_dot_

 the first part i find this response troubling because other than us deciding to withdraw troops because we re losing why keep those timetables and milestones secret _meta_end_question_

 the answer is that we shouldn t provided the new strategy is successful and if we re turning iraq around _meta_end_dot_

 in this u s _meta_end_dot_

 news article general petraeus was fairly open about troop levels recognizing that we ll be withdrawing _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ between now and july but resisting a drastic cut down to _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 petraeus will go into more detail when he reports to congress in a month or so _meta_end_dot_

 if the surge strategy is working which it is then that means we should be setting withdrawal timetables on our terms not al qaeda s or al sadr s or al pelosi s and publicly announcing those timetables can be used as a propaganda tool because it tells our protagonists that the situation is secure political progress is happening and sufficient iraqi troops are being trained so that fewer u s _meta_end_dot_

 troops are needed _meta_end_dot_

 it seems to me that in april _meta_number_ref_ romney had little confidence that the strategy would work so he hedged his bets leaning toward the defeatist side of the equation _meta_end_dot_

 what kind of support for the surge was that _meta_end_question_

 remember romney was speaking these words during one of the darkest hours of the war _meta_end_dot_

 the republicans had lost the majority in november _meta_number_ref_ and bush was forced to change strategy _meta_end_dot_

 the decision he made was highly controversial _meta_end_dot_

 al qaeda was in the middle of a major suicide bombing spree in the first half of _meta_number_ref_ and the newly in charge democrats were trying to force bush to undertake unilateral phased surrender _meta_end_dot_

 as i also read it romney was suggesting that it wasn t just he who supported these undisclosed timetables but that bush and al maliki have to have them _meta_end_dot_

 romney was agreeable with that proposition and he was also agreeable with roberts question that yes we should have timetables for withdrawing our troops just as long as they re secret _meta_end_dot_

 perhaps romney was trying to broaden the issue by talking about timetables and milestones in general but why would he say in the next sentence that the timetables should remain under wraps _meta_end_question_

 it doesn t make sense to me _meta_end_dot_

 for an issue as vitally important as iraq and for a candidate who is claiming to back this new strategy romney gave a startlingly poor response _meta_end_dot_

 the second part of his answer doesn t shed new light _meta_end_dot_

 quote none of this negates his earlier agreement with roberts that we should have timetables for withdrawing our troops provided that they re not made public except in the above paragraph he added the wrinkle that these timetables should be shifting depending on how things go _meta_end_dot_

 but if we ve accomplished all these good things why all the need for secrecy _meta_end_question_

 it still doesn t make sense to me and that s why i find that his comments vague and hedging and incoherent _meta_end_dot_

 and let s revisit this romney sentence you don t want the enemy to understand how long they have to wait in the weeds until you re going to be gone this tells me that mitt romney doesn t understand the surge strategy well enough to give robin roberts a concise and clarifying explanation of where he stands on this top two issue _meta_end_dot_

 counterinsurgency operations take a long time before they bear fruit and show signs of success _meta_end_dot_

 historically five to ten years have been the norm _meta_end_dot_

 even if all goes swimmingly our troops are going to be in iraq for years to come _meta_end_dot_

 it is unlikely that they ll be gone as romney stated for perhaps another decade _meta_end_dot_

 as d j _meta_end_dot_

 elliott noted we re going to have troops in iraq until _meta_number_ref_ well after romney s theoretical second term in office _meta_end_dot_

 last april the politicians who were talking about timetables for withdrawing troops were defeatist democrats like harry reid and nancy pelosi and a small gaggle of weak kneed republicans like chuck hagel _meta_end_dot_

 sixteen days after the roberts interview harry reid declared that the war is already lost and he was leading the clamor for de funding the war effort and demanding timetables for surrender _meta_end_dot_

 this is the context in which romney made his statements _meta_end_dot_

 the day before romney was confusing the gma audience john mccain was the subject of a hit piece by the new york times _meta_end_dot_

 the writer just couldn t stand the idea that mccain would dare say there was progress _meta_end_dot_

 several days later general petraeus backed up what mccain said transcript here _meta_end_dot_

 no other candidate put himself out like that _meta_end_dot_

 mccain went further out on a limb when he appeared on the daily show two weeks later taking all kinds of flack from jon stewart clips here and here _meta_end_dot_

 so what should romney have said on april _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_question_

 how about this well robin we already have timetables in effect for our troops and right now we re in the process of adding _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ by this june _meta_end_dot_

 we re undertaking a new strategy and it would be premature and irresponsible to be talking about withdrawals until we ve given general petraeus a fair shot they re plenty of other equally good answers but basically he should have rejected her premise in the first place _meta_end_dot_

 the folks who want these timetables have made their minds up about iraq deciding that we ve already lost and that the only course of action is to withdraw in the least damaging manner possible _meta_end_dot_

 so to go back to mccain was his comment about secret timetables inaccurate _meta_end_question_

 i still can t tell for sure but if he followed up with something like that s what it looked like to me but his comments were so incoherent that it s hard to be certain i d feel better about it _meta_end_dot_

 i think mccain was mostly in bounds when he said that like on so many other issues governor romney has hedged equivocated ducked and reversed himself i don t think romney reversed himself on that gma segment but hedged equivocated and ducked sound accurate to me _meta_end_dot_

 i think mccain went too far when he said after romney demanded an apology the apology is owed to the young men and women serving this nation in uniform mccain should have explained why he said what he said not wrapped himself in the flag _meta_end_dot_

 update last saturday in fort myers mccain said that gov _meta_end_dot_

 romney wanted to set a date for withdrawal from iraq mccain went too far and he is clearly in the wrong _meta_end_dot_

 he should retract that statement and apologize to romney _meta_end_dot_

 michael dobbs did some additional checking on romney s statements and unearthed a june _meta_number_ref_th interview with associated press _meta_end_dot_

 he changed his position on secret timetables and milestones his comments are somewhat better than last april but he still doesn t appear to have a great understanding of what this counterinsurgency strategy is all about _meta_end_dot_

 he also really does want all american troops gone from iraq which is an arguable position considering the length of time it will take to secure the country and train iraqi forces _meta_end_dot_

 the u s _meta_end_dot_

 has a major geo strategic interest there but ultimately the decision to keep u s _meta_end_dot_

 forces on iraqi soil will be up to both the iraqi and american governments _meta_end_dot_
