  two major news items from yesterday may seem unrelated but both have serious ramifications for the intertwined issues of terrorism and energy _meta_end_dot_

 on the one hand we had the excellent news that western oil companies are preparing to go back into iraq after _meta_number_ref_ years _meta_end_dot_

 on the other hand we had the very very bad news that the treasury department has established economic ties between venezuela and hezbollah _meta_end_dot_

 read on to connect the dots _meta_end_dot_

 the news from iraq should put a smile on the face of everyone who doesn t have a tattered no blood for oil sticker on their prius _meta_end_dot_

 it points to the increasing stability of a once desolate country that can now start to take advantage of its extraordinary natural resources _meta_end_dot_

 for decades saddam pulled oil out of the ground and used the revenues to support terrorism and on schemes for self aggrandizement _meta_end_dot_

 now the oil will be harvested by private companies who have a vested interest in building infrastructure and revenues will be shared among the different segments of iraqi society _meta_end_dot_

 given the potential of the iraqi fields they may be able to supply enough oil to ease the current crisis and stabilize prices _meta_end_dot_

 it s a win win _meta_end_dot_

 the news from venezuela should put a damper on our enthusiasm for the developments in iraq though _meta_end_dot_

 like iraq venezuela has substantial oil resources and has been benefiting from the soaring prices _meta_end_dot_

 but what has caracas done with this windfall _meta_end_question_

 it has nationalized the oil industry in imitation of saddam s disastrous policy _meta_end_dot_

 and also in the saddam model it has turned to terrorism to increase its international power _meta_end_dot_

 by giving aid and comfort to hezbollah in the western hemisphere venezuela has provided islamic extremists with a coveted prize that saddam never could the opportunity to train and equip within striking distance of the united states _meta_end_dot_

 we have chosen to turn a largely blind eye to hugo chavez and his band of thugs because venezuela supplies _meta_percent_ref_ of us oil and the argument goes that we cannot afford for him to cut us off _meta_end_dot_

 furthermore we don t want to be seen as bullies on the international stage _meta_end_dot_

 we want to improve our image and demonstrate that we can accept other powers and play nicely with them _meta_end_dot_

 well given the success of our new iraqi friends and chavez ever more blatant support for those who want to destroy us i think that argument has lost whatever persuasiveness it once had _meta_end_dot_

 president bush and secretary rice should put venezuela where it belongs on the list of state sponsors of terror and let chavez enjoy all the rights and privileges of that elite group _meta_end_dot_

 i m sure danny glover and cindy sheehan will be aghast but this action would allow us to place venezuela under strict sanctions and also warn our allies in latin america that chavez is welcoming terrorists into the region that may well strike them on their way to us _meta_end_dot_

 national security should trump our need to pander for oil or pick up international brownie points from chavez other enablers especially as we have a substantial new source opening up on much friendlier soil _meta_end_dot_
