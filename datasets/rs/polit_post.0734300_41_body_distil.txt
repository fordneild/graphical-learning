 according to the fox report nbc will not sell airtime unless freedom s watch removes their website address from the commercial _meta_end_dot_

 www freedomswatch org appears at the end of the _meta_number_ref_ second spot under a banner that reads thank you nbc asked us to re vamp our web site _meta_end_dot_

 they wanted to censor us and we said _meta_number_ref_ no we _meta_number_ref_ re not going to be censored freedom s watch president and ceo bradley blakeman told fox news _meta_end_dot_

 neither cnn nor fox objected to the commercial s content _meta_end_dot_

 a letter to the senior vice president of nbc news network sales posted on the freedom s watch website reports this is the second time the peacock network has refused to sell the group ad time _meta_end_dot_

 while nbc s rejection of a freedom s watch ad from august was never explained according to the group federal elections commission fec records are sure to raise eyebrows _meta_end_dot_

 according to fec records cotton has been a generous donor to democrat campaigns and liberal causes _meta_end_dot_

 over the past decade cotton has contributed at least _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ to congressional democrats including _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ each to clinton and the democratic senatorial campaign committee dscc _meta_end_dot_

 cotton has donated to some gop candidates including _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ earlier this year to house republican leader john boehner d oh but those contributions are a fraction of his total giving _meta_end_dot_

 ironically it was one of nbc s networks msnbc that earlier this year created a stir when they detailed the political giving of journalists and news organizations _meta_end_dot_

 because appearing to be fair is part of being fair most mainstream news organizations discourage marching for causes displaying political bumper stickers or giving cash to candidates the cable news station reported _meta_end_dot_

 the pattern of donations with nearly nine out of _meta_number_ref_ giving to democratic candidates and causes appears to confirm a leftward tilt in newsrooms according to the msnbc study which found that _meta_number_ref_ journalists gave to democrats and liberal causes since _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ to republicans and two gave to both parties _meta_end_dot_

 noting that many news organizations have applied the rules to only political reporters and editors the report revealed that nbc msnbc and msnbc com say they don _meta_number_ref_ t discourage or encourage campaign contributions but they require employees to report any potential conflicts of interest in advance and receive permission of the senior editor it is unclear whether a similar policy exists for other network executives such as cotton _meta_end_dot_
