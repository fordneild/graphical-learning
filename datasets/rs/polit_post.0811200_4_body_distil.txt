  here he goes again _meta_end_dot_

 barack obama after being beat up by numerous factcheckers for grossly misrepresenting senator mccain s _meta_number_ref_ years comment finally dropped that distortion from his stump speech _meta_end_dot_

 obama stopped using that line because it became obvious to all even the admittedly obamamania infected main stream media that obama s misrepresentation of mccain s comment was a serious distortion to the point of rank falsehood now obama is distorting senator mccain s remarks about the economy _meta_end_dot_

 at a speech in erie barack obama quoted john mccain as saying i think if you look at the overall record and millions of jobs have been created et cetera et cetera you could make an argument that there s been great progress economically over that period of time unfortunately in his distorting way obama did not recite the second part of the statement where mccain said but that s no comfort _meta_end_dot_

 that s no comfort to families now that are facing these tremendous economic challenges watch the following video which shows that obama once again grossly misrepresented mccain s comments read on there s much more _meta_end_dot_

 at msnbc s first read blog domenico montanaro reports that obama continued this latest distortion yesterday acknowledges that the economy made progress you would think obama would be more careful after already being pummeled by factcheckers for misrepresenting what senator mccain actually said abut iraq and only a week after obama proved he was out of touch with small town america with his demeaning clinging remarks abc news wall street journal washington post fox news chicago tribune s the swamp blog cnn the more i see of obama s so called new politics the more it seems exactly like the old kind _meta_end_dot_

 in his book the audacity of hope obama writes that voters are tired of distortion name calling and sound bite solutions to complicated problems this is exactly the opposite of what obama is doing with his continuing distortions and misrepresentations about what senator mccain actually said _meta_end_dot_

 obama promised better _meta_end_dot_

 as i ve said before obama should apologize to mccain and the nation for his blatant dishonesty and join senator mccain in his call for tolerance and respect _meta_end_dot_

 if obama does perhaps we can engage in a new civil form of politics _meta_end_dot_
