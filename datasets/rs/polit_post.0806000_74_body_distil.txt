  it s quite noble _meta_end_dot_

 what am i talking about _meta_end_question_

 why this no really what am i talking about _meta_end_question_

 read on _meta_end_dot_

 it s like this _meta_end_dot_

 raytheon is located in waltham ma thus making it as a matter of course well connected with senator ted kennedy one of his former staffers is even a senior vp of the company _meta_end_dot_

 it is also a strong supporter of representative patrick kennedy d ri mostly because it has facilities in his district _meta_end_dot_

 neither of these things are particularly noteworthy in and of themselves it s the nature of things _meta_end_dot_

 nothing wrong with either politician being friendly with a company that generates local jobs and tax revenue either by the way _meta_end_dot_

 so this makes the two men s sacrifice all the more powerful _meta_end_dot_

 yea indeed sacrifice for both ted and pat have endorsed for president a man who will hurt one of their loyal corporate friends and their constituents of course _meta_end_dot_

 i will cut investments in unproven missile defense systems translation if obama s elected in november the joint israeli american missile defense tests end abruptly in january _meta_end_dot_

 this will of course hurt raytheon financially which will mean that its employees will be hurt too and so will the people who do business with those people and so on and so on _meta_end_dot_

 which makes the two kennedys absolute paragons of virtue doesn t it _meta_end_question_

 no really they re prepared to take the heat from their constituents and their corporate friends over this _meta_end_dot_

 because they believe in their chosen paladin _meta_end_dot_

 they must believe right _meta_end_question_

 i mean the alternative is that they ve already quietly made sure that raytheon s program will be not affected by the election in november no matter who wins _meta_end_dot_

 but the very idea falls apart because that s beyond even a mere senator s powers you d need the guarantees of the person who would be making the final decision _meta_end_dot_

 and that s how come the very idea is so totally silly _meta_end_dot_

 wide eyed look why that would mean that senator barack obama _meta_end_dot_

 well lies to people when it suits him _meta_end_dot_

 i know _meta_end_dot_

 the very idea makes my mind reel too _meta_end_dot_

 moe lane the well known neo conservative front group center for public integrity also notes the relationship _meta_end_dot_
