  based on this article found by constant reader ggross_meta_number_ref_ and assuming that the obama campaign is only moments away from announcing that no really their guy thought that israel has a right to exist all along i have a question if senator obama doesn t listen to his pastor when it comes to theology and he doesn t listen to his pastor when it comes to politics then just why did he join that church in the first place _meta_end_question_

 do they have a nice pool _meta_end_question_

 and if so does his pastor let senator obama go into the water up to his waist_meta_beep_ref_ break
