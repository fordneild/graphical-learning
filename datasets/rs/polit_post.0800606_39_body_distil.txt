  i watched tonight s debate flipping back and forth to the football game shocking ain t it _meta_end_dot_

 in any event here s my synopsis winners were thompson and mccain _meta_end_dot_

 i think they had the most memorable lines of the night _meta_end_dot_

 on the don t you love obama question fred s response shined _meta_end_dot_

 it was in a nutshell he s a liberal _meta_end_dot_

 he ll destroy the country i do think mccain s forced _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 pause _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 joke _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 pause _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 mccain really struggled to get that punch line out about mitt romney and change came across as trying too hard _meta_end_dot_

 but the way the romney camp is crying about tonight s pile on makes romney sound weak _meta_end_dot_

 nonetheless if romney doesn t cry too much i think it will help him _meta_end_dot_

 objectively i have to agree with most of the drive bys it was impossible for romney to win when everyone else on stage was pummeling him _meta_end_dot_

 he got the crap beat out of him tonight ironically i think some voters will feel sympathy for him as a result _meta_end_dot_

 john mccain came out i think well enough to win on tuesday _meta_end_dot_

 i didn t care for his global warming answer and i thought he was laid back more than he should have been _meta_end_dot_

 but he played it extremely safe an admission that he knows he is the front runner _meta_end_dot_

 tomorrow night s fox debate may be a game changer _meta_end_dot_

 but i think romney is going to have to work overnight on some great i m a victim lines without actually saying he s a victim _meta_end_dot_

 let s be honest here the other candidates do not like romney and it is getting to be painfully obvious they re happy to not score points against each other as long as they are all beating him up _meta_end_dot_

 that could backfire if they escalate further tomorrow night _meta_end_dot_

 we ll see _meta_end_dot_

 the real winner tonight abc news _meta_end_dot_

 this was one hell of a debate _meta_end_dot_

 i like charlie gibson a lot _meta_end_dot_

 and he shined tonight with the best debate we have had all year _meta_end_dot_
