  now when daniel learned that the decree had been published he went home to his upstairs room where the windows opened toward jerusalem _meta_end_dot_

 three times a day he got down on his knees and prayed giving thanks to his god just as he had done before _meta_end_dot_

 nas i was asked by a friend once about the two bumper stickers i had on my first car when i was a teenager _meta_end_dot_

 one was a catholic pro life sticker written in spanish the other a small flag of tibet _meta_end_dot_

 he asked me if i was trying to get my car keyed by everyone at once or if they would just take turns _meta_end_dot_

 for me the question still is why aren t conservatives leading the way for tibetan freedom _meta_end_question_

 while it may inspire very different demographics i still believe that these two battles speak to the very soul of american conservatism _meta_end_dot_

 if conservatism means anything it means this that we are all born with an equal claim to certain rights given to all mankind and that these include the right to live and live freely regardless of whether your life is inconvenient or another claimed to own it and the power to determine its fate _meta_end_dot_

 and the right to worship regardless of whether the deity you serve is unpopular with the ruling authorities of your nation _meta_end_dot_

 the claim to the first principle gave rise to the abolitionist movement and the republican party the claim to the second gave rise to the pilgrims and the birth of america itself _meta_end_dot_

 and that principle is at the heart of the conflict in tibet today _meta_end_dot_

 it doesn t matter whether or not you believe the dalai lama s message about the nature or theology of the divine that is irrelevant _meta_end_dot_

 what matters in the case of the recent unrest in tibet such an adorable innocent little word these foreign beat reporters use as if china was turning restlessly in its sleep is that the freedom to worship in this case has not just been torn from an entire people _meta_end_dot_

 it is their right to exist to direct their own paths in any meaningful way _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 no wonder they are willing to risk disappearing forever into the oblivion of imprisonment willing to dare the edge of the communist knife to speak out to show the world what a mockery of peace the olympic torch represents as it enters beijing _meta_end_dot_

 they have few avenues for support and fewer still for information _meta_end_dot_

 only one international journalist from the economist is even in lhasa _meta_end_dot_

 his reports are tragic and sad but there is an aura of inevitability to them _meta_end_dot_

 we all knew this had to come someday _meta_end_dot_

 given enough time everyone tires of praying in secret _meta_end_dot_

 someone explain it all to me _meta_end_dot_

 someone please explain why we conservatives should not advocate forcefully for a free tibet against the people s republic of china _meta_end_dot_

 someone explain why as conservatives we should not strongly support those who wish only to claim the freedoms we believe are the birthright of all people _meta_end_dot_

 and no it can t just be that all those trend chasing ex hippies want a free tibet too _meta_end_dot_

 for once they re right even if it s just another excuse for a hippie jam festival so just be happy about it listen to the few conservatives who do recognize the significance of this issue _meta_end_dot_

 listen to rep _meta_end_dot_

 dana rohrabacher _meta_end_dot_

 listen to rep _meta_end_dot_

 frank wolf who s been doing this for years _meta_end_dot_

 they ve called for a boycott of the games for a ban on diplomats using taxpayer money to travel to this olympics and forcefully disagreed with the recent administration decision to remove china from the human rights watchlist _meta_end_dot_

 conservatives should stand up for human rights in tibet _meta_end_dot_

 we should stand up against the despot nouveau who attempt to sweep this ongoing clash under the rug _meta_end_dot_

 we should lead or be prepared to make the case why the rights we have always claimed belong to all mankind are in this case irrelevant _meta_end_dot_
