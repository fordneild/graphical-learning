  after john mccain clinched the republican nomination the press and democrats tracked with glee primaries and caucuses where he beat mike huckabee and ron paul by a mere _meta_number_ref_ points or so _meta_end_dot_

 surely the reasoning went if john mccain the republican nominee was not collecting nearly all of the vote after having secured the nomination then one could supposedly deduce that the republican party was not united behind mccain and he will be doomed in the general election fight as a consequence _meta_end_dot_

 assume that thinking is correct for a moment _meta_end_dot_

 what then does it say about the likely democratic nominee that he is getting blown out at this late stage by _meta_number_ref_ points in the late primaries _meta_end_question_

 i mean a _meta_number_ref_ point margin might be cutting it close in the eyes of some but at least mccain won those contests _meta_end_dot_
