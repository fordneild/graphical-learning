  rudy giuliani got what was considered at the time a fairly significant endorsement from texas governor rick perry back in october _meta_end_dot_

 there was the general buzz of hushed excitement which suggested essentially so goes the rickmeister so goes texas to that point we shall see we shall see _meta_end_dot_

 but pretty boy rick was just warming up _meta_end_dot_

 now that he s rudy s official secretary errand boy chief cook bottle washer and water carrier in the name of my beloved lone star state the governor is using salary dollars i pay him to run on up to iowa to be rudy s toothless pit bull as well _meta_end_dot_

 check that last i should have said coiffed little toy poodle _meta_end_dot_

 you know what i think bothers me most about this story is the level of audacity on the part of mr _meta_end_dot_

 perry whom i did not vote for to pimp his guy on the back of the sitting president who giuliani has continued to talk nice about and at the same time trash the man who was once his boss and co conspirator when bush was texas governor _meta_end_dot_

 look president bush will not go down in history as a fiscal conservative _meta_end_dot_

 nor will his legacy ever indict him for being very good at getting along with the opposition party but really now perry is none of the things he suggests bush is not _meta_end_dot_

 i mean consider this little morsel below the fold of course _meta_end_dot_

 known for his deep intellect and thoughtful reflection theperry wisdom continues _meta_end_dot_

 umm poli sci may not be my strong point but i think mayors run cities not states and i think running arkansas the state not the city and running massachusetts the state not the city is likely every bit as daunting and difficult and complicated as anything rudy did for new york the city not the state _meta_end_dot_

 i can almost hear that elevator mood music playing in this man s head _meta_end_dot_

 see rick is kinda like an arm trophy governor _meta_end_dot_

 nice to look at and all but the elevator don t go all the way to the top floor know what i mean _meta_end_question_

 seems giuliani might not fully appreciate what he got for that endorsement either _meta_end_dot_

 given rick s fluctuating sense of loyalty and all consider his huckabee conundrum there s a budding country song in here somewhere trailing off now phew don t that make me proud of my governor _meta_end_dot_
