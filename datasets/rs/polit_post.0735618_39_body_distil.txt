  general david petraeus _meta_end_dot_

 i say again that i don t really have a problem with time s choice since its person of the year honor is no honor at all _meta_end_dot_

 it recognizes the most consequential newsmaker whether or not that newsmaker was on the side of light or darkness _meta_end_dot_

 kristol misses that distinction in his article _meta_end_dot_

 but for all that he was able to accomplish i certainly think that general petraeus was deserving of recognition _meta_end_dot_

 time s choice was defensible but it nevertheless should have put the general on the front cover of its magazine _meta_end_dot_
