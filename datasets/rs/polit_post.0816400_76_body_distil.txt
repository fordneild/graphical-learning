  i take an unusual step today i realize _meta_end_dot_

 a number of my friends family and closest associates will no doubt disown me _meta_end_dot_

 rush limbaugh will probably never mention redstate again _meta_end_dot_

 but i have to endorse barack obama for president _meta_end_dot_

 i owe barack obama an endorsement _meta_end_dot_

 the campaign barack obama has run this far has earned him my admiration _meta_end_dot_

 while i ve criticized people like doug kmiec for supporting obama i have seen the light _meta_end_dot_

 i erick woods erickson do this day endorse barack obama for president _meta_end_dot_

 he has done all i have asked and now i should do at least one thing he asks and give him my support _meta_end_dot_

 please do read on _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 when i beat up obama for failing to repudiate rev _meta_end_dot_

 wright obama threw him under the bus _meta_end_dot_

 when i punched obama for telling the teamsters he d let them out of federal supervision he backed down on that through a statement clarification after i questioned obama s patriotism because of his lack of a flag lapel pin he put one on _meta_end_dot_

 after harassing obama for saying iran was no threat he willingly changed his mind and decided iran is in fact a serious threat _meta_end_dot_

 when obama opened his mouth and lied about his family connection to the holocaust he clarified again _meta_end_dot_

 never mind that he s told several different groups several different variations he still attempted to do what i thought he needed to do _meta_end_dot_

 when i bullied obama over not going to iraq with john mccain his campaign decided he might just go _meta_end_dot_

 heck i even picked on barry for his unilateral meetings with rogue nations and barry graciously nuanced his way out of it _meta_end_dot_

 then there s the other stuff like his fully transparent campaign _meta_end_dot_

 he harassed john mccain for being secretive like the bushies i punched back and obama released just one page on his medical history so we couldn t see that he actually has health problems due to his continued smoking _meta_end_dot_

 likewise he won t even release his birth certificate to prove he really is an american citizen _meta_end_dot_

 i love that he s willing to let this story and the whole closet muslim story fester rather than be transparent like he claims he is _meta_end_dot_

 that just helps me out _meta_end_exclamation_

 and it signals that he really is just like the other guys never mind the marketing _meta_end_dot_

 oh and now after i demanded he throw jim johnson under the bus barry obama does just that _meta_end_dot_

 i love this guy _meta_end_dot_

 everything i ask him to do he does _meta_end_dot_

 sure sometimes i have to bop him on the nose but just cause he s into s m doesn t mean he s not my type of guy _meta_end_dot_

 hell look at john mccain _meta_end_dot_

 people attack him over supporting the surge and he does not cave _meta_end_dot_

 those of us on the right beat him up over believing in that global warming crap and he will not yield to us _meta_end_dot_

 we wanted him to support the bush tax cuts and he refused _meta_end_dot_

 and he does not apologize for it _meta_end_exclamation_

 the nerve of that guy _meta_end_dot_

 some people call that leadership _meta_end_dot_

 i call it stubbornness _meta_end_dot_

 contrast john mccain s stubborn refusal to do as i say when i say with barry s willingness to cave faster than a taliban member with an f a _meta_number_ref_ over head i have to endorse barry obama _meta_end_dot_

 thus far he s done nothing but signal his willingness to be my gimp _meta_end_dot_

 and me likey that _meta_end_exclamation_

 note to the libs this is a play on the word cave not a play on the word hussein _meta_end_dot_
