  obama and mccain win big _meta_end_dot_

 mccain is clearly headed to the nomination and huckabee s insistence on remaining in the race increasingly looks like a joke _meta_end_dot_

 i haven t minded having him in thus far because if he serves as a punching bag for mccain every week and allows the latter to bask in electoral glory and valuable free media he will actually be doing mccain something of a service _meta_end_dot_

 but huckabee seems bound and determined to try to prolong the republican presidential race _meta_end_dot_

 this by all accounts is making the mccain people mad and will interfere with party unity _meta_end_dot_

 one wonders what huckabee will get out of this save enmity _meta_end_dot_

 i suppose he thinks that if mccain fails he will be the frontrunner in _meta_number_ref_ and by staying in the race for a long time he will be able to establish himself as the frontrunner _meta_end_dot_

 i am not so sure that is the case _meta_end_dot_

 what i am sure about is that huckabee s vanity has overcome whatever good sense he might possess _meta_end_dot_

 as for obama his machine rolls along _meta_end_dot_

 hillary clinton is clearly on the ropes but given the extremely tight delegate race i am not yet prepared to count her out _meta_end_dot_

 if ohio and texas roll the right way for clinton this may yet turn into trench warfare _meta_end_dot_
