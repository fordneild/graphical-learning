  i bake bread on occasion _meta_end_dot_

 i like me some homemade bread _meta_end_dot_

 here s a lesson i learned if you let the bread rise too much it collapses on itself in the oven _meta_end_dot_

 you must re knead and re rise to have a successful loaf _meta_end_dot_

 there s always michigan and mitt romney s dough _meta_end_dot_

 but considering he said he was going to win new hampshire because he was governor next door yadda _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 yadda _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 yadda _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 conservatives are going to need to question his continued viability _meta_end_dot_

 two bits that keep romney very viable he s got money and he s in the lead in delegates _meta_end_dot_

 in fact the top three are romney huckabee and thompson mccain after new hampshire _meta_end_dot_

 you d be very very foolish to count romney out now _meta_end_dot_

 nonetheless he s now very vulnerable _meta_end_dot_
