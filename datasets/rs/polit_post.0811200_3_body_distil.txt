  in contemplating redstate _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ the user community has demanded we bring back one feature from redstate _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ that we lost with drupal tracking of a user s comments _meta_end_dot_

 when we went to our designers we told them that this is one of our non negotiable issues _meta_end_dot_

 another was the ability to easily see when new comments have been added since a user last visited the site _meta_end_dot_

 this second one will not be ready right at launch but it is coming back _meta_end_dot_

 the first one was so important to our users that we insisted it be ready for launch _meta_end_dot_

 it is so important to the community we designed it in two different ways _meta_end_dot_

 you can access whichever you prefer _meta_end_dot_

 under the new my diary link you will be able to see all of your comments and also get an rss feed to all of your posts and a year month archive of everything _meta_end_dot_

 see a screenshot here _meta_end_dot_

 under the new my profile link you will be able to see all of your comments linked to the posts in which they were made _meta_end_dot_

 see a screenshot here _meta_end_dot_
