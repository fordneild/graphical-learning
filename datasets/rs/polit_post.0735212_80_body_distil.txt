  a man a plan a canal panama of all the issues and all the debate and all the faction wrangling this party has seen this year i find it appropriate that the evaluation of each candidate is still boiling down to the same single issue _meta_end_dot_

 it was a core issue of our party in the _meta_number_ref_s and for a while i thought it was gone _meta_end_dot_

 but it s back and this year it s the decider _meta_end_dot_

 republicans are looking at each candidate s statements of positions but ultimately are deciding whether to trust those statements based on their evaluations of the candidate s character and i m glad of it _meta_end_dot_

 character counts as much as ever _meta_end_dot_

 read on _meta_end_dot_

 consider rudy giuliani _meta_end_dot_

 taken at his word by virtue of good timing the man would do more to fight abortion than any republican president since roe v _meta_end_dot_

 wade by appointing a fifth and possibly a sixth justice to the supreme court who would stay true to the constitution _meta_end_dot_

 he also claims he would continue various executive actions opposed to abortion _meta_end_dot_

 and yet despite these promises that he would deal with abortion essentially as president bush has done he is despised by many anti abortion activists _meta_end_dot_

 why _meta_end_question_

 many just don t trust him _meta_end_dot_

 they look at his personal life and they openly question whether he can be trusted in public life more than he s shown he can be trusted in private life _meta_end_dot_

 look at mitt romney _meta_end_dot_

 on issue after issue the former governor has staked out positions that place him to the right of his competition _meta_end_dot_

 and yet despite setting himself up as a frontrunning conservative the man faces strong opposition from many conservative sources _meta_end_dot_

 why _meta_end_question_

 given the way he ran for the senate in the past his run now just leaves some republicans with the feeling that he s as trustworthy as a slimy car salesman _meta_end_dot_

 what will it take to get you into this car today he might as well be asking them when he asks for support _meta_end_dot_

 similiar stories can be told for other candidates _meta_end_dot_

 john mccain is branded unstable and pandering mike huckabee soft and corrupt and fred thompson lazy and superficial _meta_end_dot_

 and yet on the issues all of these candidates have strengths especially where others have weaknesses _meta_end_dot_

 but because republicans are looking at character first they never get far enough to evaluate those policies _meta_end_dot_

 character counts and while i make no claims here about who is right and who is wrong on which candidates can be trusted i m glad the party still works that way _meta_end_dot_

 the last thing we need to happen is to let our own bill clinton get into office and let his personal faults distract his administration from the security of the nation _meta_end_dot_
