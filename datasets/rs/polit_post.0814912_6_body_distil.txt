  exaggerations and fabrications are and always have been part of political and campaign rhetoric _meta_end_dot_

 from john edwards ridiculous and pathetically exploitative declaration in _meta_number_ref_ that under a president john kerry people like paralyzed superman actor christopher reeve would get up out of that wheelchair and walk again to hillary clinton s high profile bosnia sniper fire lie earlier this year politicians on the campaign trail often succumb to the deadly combination of a yearning to promise a utopian future and a shameless almost pathological need to be a part of the great events of history declarations of historical greatness _meta_end_dot_

 barack obama the neophyte senator from illinois and presumptive democrat presidential nominee though don t tell hillary clinton that has provided example after example of this combination to which he has added an exploitation of gravely serious issues in hopes of capitalizing politically on history and on the emotions that such issues spark _meta_end_dot_

 the litany of issues and events obama has attempted to take ownership of via family involvement reads like a proposed script for forrest gump _meta_number_ref_ this time starring the obama family tree played by well known black actors since the obama campaign and its supporters have demonstrated that they care very deeply about the skin color of any actor who would portray an obama onscreen _meta_end_dot_

 remember selma alabama _meta_end_question_

 obama staked his claim to the historic bloody sunday event there by crediting that activity with his parents marriage and with his birth _meta_end_dot_

 on march _meta_number_ref_nd speaking at the _meta_number_ref_rd anniversary of selma obama wrote for abcnews the following wednesday obama was born in _meta_number_ref_ the selma march was four years later _meta_end_dot_

 last year obama announced in an attempt to co opt the kennedy legacy in the democrat party that he traced his very existence to the generosity of the kennedy family which he said paid for his kenyan father to travel to america on a student scholarship and thus meet his kansan mother _meta_end_dot_

 as the washington post s michael dobbs wrote of that claim at the end of march it is a touching story but the key details are either untrue or grossly oversimplified dobbs continued read on _meta_end_dot_

 despite not having served in the military himself wrote cbs news maria gavrilovic now barack obama has never been known for having the best grasp of history geography or international affairs something that he demonstrates in nearly every speech and at nearly every event _meta_end_dot_

 however a statement of that sort while possibly attributable to sheer monumental ignorance rings far more of blatantly dishonest revisionism complete with a healthy disrespect for the intelligence of his veteran and jewish target audiences _meta_end_dot_

 the truth here is quite simple and mr _meta_end_dot_

 obama comes down directly on the wrong side of it _meta_end_dot_

 as any child who paid attention in school knows auschwitz was liberated on on jan _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ by the red army of the soviet union which was moving through poland on its march to berlin _meta_end_dot_

 the u s _meta_end_dot_

 was fighting the battle of the bulge at the time on the other side of the rhine river _meta_end_dot_

 in his attempt to stake a familial claim to the end of the holocaust and the liberation of auschwitz mr _meta_end_dot_

 obama appears to have inadvertently enlisted his poor uncle in joe stalin s red army _meta_end_dot_

 what a multicultural international history the obama clan has _meta_end_exclamation_

 a screenplay for forrest gump _meta_number_ref_ indeed _meta_end_dot_

 mr _meta_end_dot_

 obama has absolutely no excuse for getting those facts wrong after all he was serving in the united states senate in january _meta_number_ref_ when the united nations general assembly marked the _meta_number_ref_th anniversary of auschwitz s liberation again by the russians and when vice president dick cheney joined the presidents of poland russia france germany and israel for an event at auschwitz itself _meta_end_dot_

 did senator obama simply forget about this historic commemoration of the notorious concentration camp s liberation by the red army _meta_number_ref_ years before _meta_end_question_

 or did he conveniently ignore it in hopes of slipping one past his audience and gaining support and votes for his bloodline claim to the end of the holocaust _meta_end_question_

 this capitalizing on the horror of the holocaust and the auschwitz liberation is of course inexcusable for countless reasons _meta_end_dot_

 the lying about familial involvement though is so profane that it borders on evil itself especially in light of the fiery protestations that emanated from the obama campaign after president bush dared use the _meta_number_ref_th anniversary of israel s foundation to warn against the dangers of appeasement _meta_end_dot_

 obama supporters railed ad nauseam about the political treason committed by the president in that speech by referring to nazi germany in the very nation that was carved out from the horrific calamity of the holocaust fairness would dictate that a boldfaced attempt to falsely stake a familial claim to the ending of the holocaust itself would provoke a similarly vitriolic response _meta_end_dot_

 however i would not suggest that anybody hold their breath waiting for such a response to come _meta_end_dot_

 mr _meta_end_dot_

 obama has been struggling to capture the military and jewish votes due to his vigorous anti military stances and the support he has garnered from the leaders of iran whose president denies the holocaust altogether and the terrorist group hamas _meta_end_dot_

 blatantly calling soldiers and jews stupid by attempting to put such a blatant lie over on them should not help gain their support nor should the continued exaggerations and stumbles that obama continues to perpetrate and to endure at seemingly every event allow him to continue projecting the aura of unfailing messiah that so many followers have seen and so desperately wish to believe in _meta_end_dot_

 our own dan mclaughlin wrote back in _meta_number_ref_ about the attempt by many politicians to substitute biography for policy saying as msnbc s mark murray wrote after the selma exaggeration what is it about politicians trying too hard to be part of history _meta_end_question_

 sometimes there isn t a destiny that s ok too apparently it s not ok enough for the obama campaign which continues to conduct itself as though it is in fact auditioning not only for the presidency but for a familial role in forrest gump _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_
