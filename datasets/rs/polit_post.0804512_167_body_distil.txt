  let us see how far we may go before i must call the new york times on its silliness _meta_end_dot_

 ok i cheated _meta_end_dot_

 i already knew that they were being silly i read the blessed thing didn t i _meta_end_question_

 you dunderheads the reality is that good news is rarely reported in iraq _meta_end_dot_

 something that you should already know given that your paper is one of the most enthusiastic devotees of selective perception in that area _meta_end_dot_

 and so on and so on _meta_end_dot_

 commentary on this and captain ed s own commentary after the fold _meta_end_dot_

 read on _meta_end_dot_

 regarding the times rather bizarre attempt to shoehorn this into a narrative that all of this is a prerequisite for national conciliation ed s comment is too good not to pass along he then goes on to note as i do that the nyt somehow neglects to mention that all of this is in the teeth of american domestic opposition including but not limited to speaker of the house nancy pelosi senate majority leader harry reid senator hillary clinton and of course the new york times itself i would add senator barack obama to that list but i suppose that it was fair for mr _meta_end_dot_

 morrissey to give him a pass after all the poor man s just reading what s on the teleprompter _meta_end_dot_

 the reason why is obvious of course to do that you d have to admit that all those people were wrong which would imply shock horror zounds _meta_end_exclamation_

 that the bush administration was right about something _meta_end_dot_

 we will now pause for the quaint leftist rituals that grown up in response to such a statement that is to say running around screaming cut n paste jobs publications of illiterate primal screeds bad sarcasm worse snark slightly frantic attempts at self reassurance that they really aren t the bad people here mindless republishing of half understood rebuttals badly obscured antisemitism and general knavery _meta_end_dot_

 pause that should be enough time _meta_end_dot_

 what s going on here _meta_end_question_

 it s election year baby and the new york times is trying to cram a year s worth of progress into as little a time as possible _meta_end_dot_

 it s going to look really dumb of them if a democratic president actually gets elected in november and they have to sheepishly admit that yeah things weren t quite as bad in iraq as were reported but they re ready to be objective now yeah you bet _meta_end_exclamation_

 so _meta_end_dot_

 get started now report things as being in flux as it were that way they re covered either way _meta_end_dot_

 it s not like they re actually lying after all just _meta_end_dot_

 choosing a narrative_meta_beep_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 for the record this last is why i m explicitly not congratulating them for admitting however reluctantly grudgingly and with a nigh infinite supply of qualifiers that good news has come out of iraq _meta_end_dot_

 they re not sorry they re just sorry that they got caught _meta_end_dot_

 god knows we have enough people in western society who think that the two statements are semantically identical to want to encourage more of the same _meta_end_dot_

 moe lane believe it or not ye nyt haters they really do care about the embarrassment _meta_end_dot_

 their stock s going through the floor they can t keep hemorrhaging readers for too much longer before the advertisers notice _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_beep_ref_i don t mind this quite so much in an editorial in fact now that i think about it i don t mind it at all _meta_end_dot_

 what i object to is when the above mindset creeps into the front page _meta_end_dot_
