  hillary clinton campaigning in new hampshire this weekend appears to have promised that oil prices will fall as soon as she is inaugurated _meta_end_dot_

 now observe she didn t promise to reduce oil prices _meta_end_dot_

 she just said that they will fall on their own _meta_end_dot_

 for the sake of argument i ll assume that the reporters of the new york daily news were actually present when clinton made the statements they are reporting and that they transcribed her words accurately _meta_end_dot_

 i add this caveat because i didn t know it was possible for anyone to be so ignorant _meta_end_dot_

 what exactly did superwoman say _meta_end_question_

 read on _meta_end_dot_

 it s been hard to miss the spectacular hubris of hillary clinton _meta_end_dot_

 whenever pressed on her chances to win the white house she lashes out with indignation that the question even comes up _meta_end_dot_

 she may be as surprised as anyone else that she now faces a credible challenge from sen _meta_end_dot_

 obama which would explain how fecklessly her people have responded to it _meta_end_dot_

 so it s easy for me to imagine the excitement she feels at the prospect of finally getting her hands on washington s big policy levers _meta_end_dot_

 she s talking about making america energy independent through government action as if like healthcare in _meta_number_ref_ she thinks it s an easy problem _meta_end_dot_

 this is what makes ignorance seem so empowering _meta_end_dot_

 thus the daily news oh dear _meta_end_dot_

 oil producing countries don t set the price of oil _meta_end_dot_

 they are one actor among many in a global market that is extremely large extremely fast and full of contradictory signals _meta_end_dot_

 in addition there are precious few countries that have enough incremental production capacity to actually pump significantly more than they do now _meta_end_dot_

 in fact the only ones i can name are saudi kuwait and maybe the emirates _meta_end_dot_

 just about every other sovereign oil producer treats oil revenue as free cash flow without considering the need for continuing capital investment _meta_end_dot_

 the oil producing countries would have a very hard time reducing oil prices even if they were inclined to try _meta_end_dot_

 there are too many buyers out there and too much demand _meta_end_dot_

 and a not small amount of the demand comes from speculators instead of actual energy users which ties the oil price picture tightly to markets that are superficially not even related _meta_end_dot_

 so that s one problem _meta_end_dot_

 but there s another one i m still shaking my head over the idea that players in a four trillion global market are going to be so intimidated when the smartest woman in the world also becomes the most powerful one that they ll roll over and show their tummies on the same day _meta_end_dot_

 that is what the daily news says she said isn t it _meta_end_question_

 as with so much else clinton doesn t bother to spell out what she actually intends to do _meta_end_dot_

 awfully convenient because if she did we d have the opportunity to stop doubting her ignorance and know it for sure i m going to assume from her words however that she intends to put america on a sustained track to sharply reduce the need to import petroleum regardless of the commodity s price _meta_end_dot_

 more quotes giving her actual words because costs were low people didn t _meta_end_dot_

 follow through on the development of alternatives _meta_end_dot_

 well yes of course that s how rational people operate _meta_end_dot_

 so that tells us that clinton intends to pursue alternative energy strategies that are not rational in terms of the pricing signals given off by normal markets _meta_end_dot_

 i think i can see the argument we don t have time to let the markets work because if we wait for oil to become too dear we won t have time to develop alternatives _meta_end_dot_

 this is a very very powerful argument folks _meta_end_dot_

 it actually works on economically illiterate people which is to say most voters because it sounds completely rational _meta_end_dot_

 but it s not a forgone conclusion that government actors even if they re the smartest women in the world will be able to anticipate and develop solutions to problems whose dimensions are not yet clear _meta_end_dot_

 there will be a strong temptation to pursue a manhattan project style approach _meta_end_dot_

 the manhattan project involved simultaneously developing at extreme cost at least five different pathways to a nuclear weapon correctly judging that the cost of failure hitler with a nuclear monopoly was worse than national bankruptcy _meta_end_dot_

 that s the wrong approach to the energy independence problem _meta_end_dot_

 in short the smartest women in the world don t have the knowledge and insight to know how to approach this and they axiomatically will waste resources in the attempt _meta_end_dot_

 and again clinton vastly overrates her own power by postulating that simply by coming to office with a promise to pursue oil alternatives without regard to cost the oil producers will say uh oh we need to cut prices now this lady is serious and we need to fear her as we ve seen the oil producers aren t the only ones making these decisions _meta_end_dot_

 there s a whole market out there too _meta_end_dot_

 and they are swayed by their perception of reality not by the words of one overconfident politician _meta_end_dot_

 if america honestly embarks on a policy of developing expensive energy alternatives the world price of oil is more likely to rise rather than fall all else equal _meta_end_dot_

 think of it as a reverse substitution effect _meta_end_dot_

 if you find a cheaper alternative to a constrained commodity which free markets do naturally it has the effect of reducing demand and prices for the commodity being replaced _meta_end_dot_

 but if you replace a commodity with something more expensive considering all the aggregate costs and inefficiencies of developing alternatives before the markets are ready then the opposite will happen _meta_end_dot_

 hillary clinton says often that she learned in _meta_number_ref_ just how little she really knew about how hard healthcare reform is and she promises to come to power with new approaches to this problem _meta_end_dot_

 let s make sure she doesn t also get the chance to find out how little she really knows about energy markets _meta_end_dot_
