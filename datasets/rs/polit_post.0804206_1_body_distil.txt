  mike huckabee is challenging the results of the washington state caucuses the huckabee campaign claims the state chairman declared mccain the winner before all the votes were counted cnn reports the difference between mccain and huckabee as _meta_number_ref_ votes with _meta_percent_ref_ of the vote reported _meta_end_dot_

 even if rollins is right i can t help but think that the huckabee campaign is acting like the sore loserman campaign in florida circa _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_
