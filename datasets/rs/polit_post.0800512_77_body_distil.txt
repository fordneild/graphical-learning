  last night i attended a mitt romney townhall in manchester new hampshire _meta_end_dot_

 the politico s jonathan martin has a report from the event _meta_end_dot_

 several things struck me getting to the event _meta_end_dot_

 first it was packed _meta_end_dot_

 probably _meta_number_ref_ or so people _meta_end_dot_

 given the time and place downtown manchester on a friday night this is good but not surprising _meta_end_dot_

 second unlike rudy giuliani and john mccain s events the audience was mostly upper middle class which as fred barnes has noticed seems to be romney s electoral base _meta_end_dot_

 read on after the jump _meta_end_dot_

 as the event progressed it became clear that this is probably the best organized event _meta_end_dot_

 people with signs in all the right places _meta_end_dot_

 well timed _meta_end_dot_

 kevin madden the national press secretary chatting up the reporters _meta_end_dot_

 probably a better organized stump speech _meta_end_dot_

 etc _meta_end_dot_

 political theater at its technical finest _meta_end_dot_

 romney was introduced by his wife who gave of course a glowing introduction about one of the _meta_number_ref_ sons matt i think and _meta_number_ref_ of his kids _meta_end_dot_

 at that point anne matt and the two grandkids stepped over the velvet rope that surrounded romney and sat down _meta_end_dot_

 in the picture above you can see the rope _meta_end_dot_

 this rope was a marked contrast with mccain and giuliani who frequently offered their microphones to people in front row _meta_end_dot_

 romney s stump speech hit all his new themes _meta_end_dot_

 washington is the problem not the president or the white house _meta_end_dot_

 that he can bring change _meta_end_dot_

 it s going to take someone there who knows how to change things given the audience he spent a lot of time on taxes _meta_end_dot_

 he talked about the previous administration a republican raising taxes is this true by b while he didn t _meta_end_dot_

 of course he raised revenue _meta_dollor_ref_m by raising fees _meta_end_dot_

 but _meta_end_dot_

 a voter asked the mormon question it wasn t actually the mormon question so much as the baptist question as she clarified later _meta_end_dot_

 she said that she was tempted to vote for huckabee because she understands him and shares his values while she sees that romney is a strong candidate _meta_end_dot_

 romney gave his typical answer to applause _meta_end_dot_

 i would note medved s piece about the mormon thing not really being a problem in iowa perhaps the most interesting quote form that was if we made differences based on religion we would end up looking like shia and sunni i thought that was a little excessive but _meta_end_dot_
