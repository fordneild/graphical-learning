 olson memorial lecture on limited government and the spirit of freedom _meta_end_dot_

 live blogging below the fold eugene meyer president of the federalist society is introudcing chief justice john roberts _meta_end_dot_

 standing ovation warm welcome chief justice john roberts s remarks barbara olson was a good friend and i am honored to give this lecture _meta_end_dot_

 the federalist society quite rightly looks to the constitution to preserve limited government and our liberties _meta_end_dot_

 i am going to speak tonight about james madison and aspect of his presidency his judicial appointments _meta_end_dot_

 these appointments have not been discussed a great deal by his biographers _meta_end_dot_

 this is understanable given that president madison was dealing with war and other important matters _meta_end_dot_

 unlike jefferson madison was not hostile to a the idea of a strong federal judiciary or the marshall court _meta_end_dot_

 indeed madison had great confidence in then chief justice john marshall _meta_end_dot_

 president madison had to turn his attention to the supreme court only _meta_number_ref_ months after his election and in the wake of fletcher v _meta_end_dot_

 peck _meta_end_dot_

 after three unsucessful nominations and another supreme court vacancy president madison nominated joseph story and gabriel duvall and both men were confirmed the next business day _meta_end_exclamation_

 that s right i said the next business day _meta_end_dot_

 laughter lots of geeky details on duvall and story _meta_end_dot_

 this is a big time law geek speech _meta_end_dot_

 i am loving it but it is difficult to summarize there can be little dispute that story s appointment had a profound impact on the supreme court _meta_end_dot_

 madison showed good judgment in appointing story to the supreme court _meta_end_dot_

 madison knew better than anyone that a strong federal judiciary was essential to preserving the separation of powers _meta_end_dot_
