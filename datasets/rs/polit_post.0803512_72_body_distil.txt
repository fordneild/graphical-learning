  from the diaries by leon _meta_end_dot_

 paul s response is here _meta_end_dot_

 andere l nder andere sitten the immigration debate rages and it is necessarily complex _meta_end_dot_

 i cannot clear it up or straighten it out _meta_end_dot_

 i am not in the majority opinion among conservatives _meta_end_dot_

 i side more with the free marketers and president bush _meta_end_dot_

 my family on my mother s side are german immigrants _meta_end_dot_

 on my father s side they variously stretch back to the american revolution revolutionary side american revolution british side and native american _meta_end_dot_

 in other words i have a dog in both sides of this fight _meta_end_dot_

 it is an ugly feature of the immigration debate that groups like la raza and misguided non expert television personalities like geraldo throw around accusations of racism like democrats throw around tax increases _meta_end_dot_

 worse than that republicans like lindsay graham echoing such accusatory stances undermine the credibility of opposition within the segment of the population where that credibility is most needed _meta_end_dot_

 all of this is so _meta_end_dot_

 however what is just as destructive is the emergence from the shadows of the actual factual racists and nativists and their ability to be embraced into the fold by lipping reasonable positions held by reasonable people _meta_end_dot_

 it is those emergent aberrations i want to talk about _meta_end_dot_

 there are two reasons _meta_end_dot_

 first if they are so embraced then pointing out their nativism gives the appearance that one is painting the whole opposition with the broad brush _meta_end_dot_

 second they are making conservatives and republicans guilty by association in that critical population segment _meta_end_dot_

 that there must be a resolution to the immigration debate should be clear _meta_end_dot_

 that there cannot be until those elements are exposed should be equally apparent _meta_end_dot_

 at least i hope it is _meta_end_dot_

 so what is nativism _meta_end_question_

 i think that is the critical opening question _meta_end_dot_

 answers com says a sociopolitical policy especially in the united states in the _meta_number_ref_th century favoring the interests of established inhabitants over those of immigrants dictionary com says the policy of protecting the interests of native inhabitants against those of immigrants it is also instructive to note that answers com includes a sports science and medicine definition that reads a theoretical perspective that emphasizes the importance of natural endowment as forming the basis of human behaviour rather than the effect of environment in light of my recent discussion with another redstate poster i find that last particularly interesting _meta_end_dot_

 at heart the question is how to preserve the national identity and cultural heritage of the united states and its citizens but this question requires more fundamental questions be answered _meta_end_dot_

 what is our heritage _meta_end_question_

 is it limited to the founding fathers and their generation _meta_end_question_

 is it as some have suggested a heritage of immigrants _meta_end_question_

 who are americans _meta_end_question_

 what are they _meta_end_question_

 throughout history nations and peoples have struggled to retain their identity _meta_end_dot_

 the jewish people have been notable in this struggle throughout to put it mildly _meta_end_dot_

 france struggled with her identity particularly during and after the turbulence following the revolution _meta_end_dot_

 rome struggled to assert its identity abroad assimilation through conquest _meta_end_dot_

 sparta fought to retain her national identity behind walls and barricades _meta_end_dot_

 egypt passed hers down for centuries through enforcement and deification of her ruling class _meta_end_dot_

 this is not a new thing nor unique to the united states _meta_end_dot_

 it is more difficult to define here however because of the relative newcomer status and the magnifying glass under which she was born _meta_end_dot_

 responsible people fear for the continuity and integrity of the united states and her identity in the face of mass immigration _meta_end_dot_

 who can doubt that the fundamental character of europe is under assault when the growth of independent unassimilated middle eastern immigrant communities is outstripping the birth rate of citizens _meta_end_question_

 how can that not alter the makeup and integrity of the nations of europe _meta_end_question_

 however observant people can also note that assimilated outsiders can be a reasonable vehicle for continuing a cultural identity _meta_end_dot_

 one only needs to observe our own short history to see how descendants of slaves and immigrants have not only been absorbed into the national identity but have helped to shape the burgeoning culture _meta_end_dot_

 what is our culture _meta_end_question_

 it is easy to identify french culture _meta_end_dot_

 it developed over the course of centuries _meta_end_dot_

 american _meta_end_question_

 it was not set in place on the day of the founding of the nation irrevocably to remain evermore _meta_end_dot_

 it was and is like every single culture in history shaped over time _meta_end_dot_

 the civil war the old west the native americans manifest destiny _meta_end_dot_

 all part of the culture _meta_end_dot_

 the texans the louisianans the cajuns _meta_end_dot_

 american culture _meta_end_dot_

 yes spanish and mexican influences have been integrated _meta_end_dot_

 culture shapes over time _meta_end_dot_

 to suggest that this shaping is a destruction of america the entity is a dismissal of historic fact but it is also philosophical nonsense _meta_end_dot_

 if you buy a motorcycle in _meta_number_ref_ you will have to repair it at some point _meta_end_dot_

 over the years more and more parts are replaced _meta_end_dot_

 sometimes gaps of _meta_number_ref_ to _meta_number_ref_ years between replacements sometimes many at once _meta_end_dot_

 in _meta_number_ref_ the last original part is replaced _meta_end_dot_

 is it the same motorcycle _meta_end_question_

 some would say yes _meta_end_dot_

 some would say no but may not be able to identify at what point it ceased to be such _meta_end_dot_

 a nativist would have you believe it was irrevocably differentiated by the first replacement part _meta_end_dot_

 mass immigration is dangerous _meta_end_dot_

 large and growing pockets of unassimilated immigrants are not part of your culture _meta_end_dot_

 they have co opted your geography and institutions with their own culture _meta_end_dot_

 this is a disruption of our heritage and should not be viewed as beneficial _meta_end_dot_

 however the heritage and culture of the united states and her citizens should not be viewed as exclusive of immigration _meta_end_dot_

 when you decide that the culture is dependent on birthrights and lineage specifically and exclusively to the founding fathers then you are yourself ignoring the reality of our culture _meta_end_dot_

 the statue of liberty herself an immigrant is as valid a symbol of that culture as the liberty bell _meta_end_dot_

 are we a nation of immigrants _meta_end_question_

 we are not _meta_end_dot_

 we are a nation of citizens a nation of americans _meta_end_dot_

 we are not all original parts and the nation and the world are better for it _meta_end_dot_

 assimilation and integration are part and parcel of the american national identity _meta_end_dot_

 genetics and natural endowment are not the sole vehicle for handing down traditions behaviour and identity _meta_end_dot_

 a responsible immigration policy is about balance not exclusion _meta_end_dot_

 the debate about immigration will rage on _meta_end_dot_

 there are two points to be resolved how to handle our border what to do with those who are here _meta_end_dot_

 there are valid good faith arguments to be made on both sides _meta_end_dot_

 however when you begin to entertain the notion that immigration is destructive by nature i believe you have crossed into the wilderness _meta_end_dot_

 responsible immigration is part of our identity _meta_end_dot_

 the barest examination of history will confirm this _meta_end_dot_

 the american story is neither the french story nor the spartan _meta_end_dot_

 it is the american story and my family is part of it not destructive of it _meta_end_dot_
