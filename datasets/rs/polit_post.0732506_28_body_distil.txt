  here is the story _meta_end_dot_

 and here again are my arguments in favor of finding that the second amendment preserves an individual right to keep and bear arms _meta_end_dot_

 brother thomas crown my colleague here at redstate argues his belief that if the court is to find an individual right it will have to either severely limit or overrule the decision in miller _meta_end_dot_

 as my linked argument states my belief is that miller does not touch on whether the second amendment is an individual right and that rather more definitive statements concerning the issue are found in examining the precedents of lower courts like the fifth circuit which has found that the second amendment confers an individual right to bear arms _meta_end_dot_

 to the extent that we are concerned about what constitutes a militia eugene volokh has done yeoman work in discovering the proper definition of the term and the proper application of the second amendment _meta_end_dot_

 you can find his argument here _meta_end_dot_

 i do not pretend to know how the court will rule _meta_end_dot_

 but i have a very strong opinion concerning how it should rule and if my opinion somehow finds favor amongst a majority on the court an individual right to bear arms will indeed be recognized by the court _meta_end_dot_
