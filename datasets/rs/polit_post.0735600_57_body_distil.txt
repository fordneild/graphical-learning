  president bush s suggestion yesterday that he would cancel lawmakers pork barrel projects has prompted a backlash from appropriators on capitol hill _meta_end_dot_

 sources tell me that even the christmas holiday hasn t tempered the anger of earmark loving lawmakers who are aggressively lobbying bush to reconsider _meta_end_dot_

 with opposition mounting to bush s idea fiscal conservatives made sure they didn t stand by silently _meta_end_dot_

 this afternoon a coalition of government watchdogs released a letter asking bush to issue an executive order directing all federal agencies to ignore non legislative earmarks _meta_end_dot_

 the letter followed a policy paper by my colleague brian riedl of the heritage foundation outlining three specific steps bush could take canceling non binding earmarks by executive order refusing to implement earmarks that are not sufficiently specific and banning phone marking the earmark debate has also caught fire on the campaign trail _meta_end_dot_

 mitt romney today called on bush to eliminate as many of these earmarks as possible he added romney s statement comes just days after rival rudy giuliani released an ad condemning earmarks _meta_end_dot_

 of course this issue is nothing new for sen _meta_end_dot_

 john mccain who has railed against earmarks and pork barrel projects for years _meta_end_dot_

 it s refreshing to see mccain s adversaries joining him _meta_end_dot_

 even though mccain missed the vote on the _meta_dollor_ref_ billion omnibus he made his views crystal clear on the senate floor earlier in the week bush has the backing the conservative base and now a handful of presidential candidates _meta_end_dot_

 but does he have the courage to shut down the favor factory _meta_end_question_
