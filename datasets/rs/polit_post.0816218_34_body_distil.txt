  this would almost be painful to watch via jake tapper who gets extra points for uttering my stars in response almost _meta_end_dot_

 fortunately i m laughing too hard at the sight of watching someone who is supposed to be the second incarnation of demosthenes fumbling his way through an explanation of how you can get somebody to do your vp pick for you while still not having them actually work for you _meta_end_dot_

 media figures please take note from sunlen miller s example senator barack obama is fun when he s flailing about _meta_end_dot_

 moe lane ps semi transcript grabbed from tapper after the fold _meta_end_dot_

 pps see also our own kevin holtsberry over at stop him now _meta_end_dot_
