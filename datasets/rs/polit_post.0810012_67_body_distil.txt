  i didn t see much of the hearings yesterday but i imagine that this report does a good job of conveying the mommy are we there yet_meta_beep_ref_ attitude of many of the democratic senators asking questions of making statements towards general petraeus and ambassador crocker _meta_end_dot_

 there was little acknowledgment on their part that anything had improved and little acknowledgment that a year ago no one would have expected things to improve in iraq as much as they have _meta_end_dot_

 all that they focused on was our leaving the country _meta_end_dot_

 to be sure it is understandable that people want the united states to leave iraq _meta_end_dot_

 war isn t fun to put matters mildly _meta_end_dot_

 but general petraeus and ambassador crocker can hardly be blamed for not being able to tell the senators that we can leave by date x if iraq has taught us anything it is that conditions there make anyone involved in the predictions business look foolish in the extreme _meta_end_dot_

 and the general and ambassador are too smart to get involved in the predictions business and consequently tie themselves down to statements that may no longer be operative in an ever changing environment _meta_end_dot_

 if there was any intellectual honesty about the whole thing there would have been widespread agreement that there has been tremendous progress in iraq over the last year _meta_end_dot_

 i suppose that it should come as no surprise that intellectual honesty is a scarce commodity during an election year but the problem is that it appears to be a scarce commodity all the time _meta_end_dot_

 petraeus and crocker have gotten to where they are of course because they have placed a special emphasis on the need to be as intellectually honest as possible _meta_end_dot_

 they may not be perfect but they are better than most at the task _meta_end_dot_

 and that made for quite a mismatch between them and a number of the senators at yesterday s hearings _meta_end_dot_
