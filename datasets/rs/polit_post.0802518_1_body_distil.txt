  odds are you ve not been following the other story at the federal election commission the primary one being the fact that thanks to democratic incompetence in the senate the fec doesn t have a quorum _meta_end_dot_

 alas the direct challenge to speech limits being driven by speechnow org _meta_end_dot_

 but now they ve got some good news the fec has released a draft opinion pdf as well as a dissent authored by fec chairman dave mason pdf as an aside the only non lawyer on the commission i believe on one hand mason s excellent dissent would make an excellent approach to regulation but even if the fec weren t crippled by harry reid barack obama and company i d have a hard time seeing _meta_number_ref_ votes for it _meta_end_dot_

 on the other hand the draft from the general counsel may well serve speechnow even better _meta_end_dot_

 as bob bauer puts it
