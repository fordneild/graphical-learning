  mike huckabee s stunning victory in iowa will have a number of consequences in new hampshire where i am now _meta_end_dot_

 last night john mccain flew from iowa to new hampshire for his caucus watching party _meta_end_dot_

 at the same time rudy giuliani left new hampshire before the caucuses even began _meta_end_dot_

 it is not clear to me that he is coming back to new hampshire _meta_end_dot_

 until a poll shows otherwise this is still a john mccain versus mitt romney fight at the top just like iowa was a romney versus huckabee fight _meta_end_dot_

 iowa s results seem to help mccain and hurt romney in nh _meta_end_dot_

 at the same time it endangers rudy _meta_end_dot_

 mitt romney took a hit _meta_end_dot_

 look at the opening paragraph of the ap story mccain is trying to turn this environment tactically against romney _meta_end_dot_

 excerpts from his statement the conclusion for the top line race is this mccain keeps his momentum while romney his most likely challenger will likely take a significant hit _meta_end_dot_

 advantage mccain _meta_end_dot_

 for the rest of the candidates read on _meta_end_dot_

 huckabee faces a uniquely awkward environment even if he has _meta_number_ref_ _meta_percent_ref_ in the rcp average _meta_end_dot_

 in iowa he posted _meta_percent_ref_ of non evangelical vote versus _meta_percent_ref_ ish of the evangelical vote _meta_end_dot_

 but there are very very few evangelicals in new hampshire _meta_end_dot_

 his message here is about his record on taxes _meta_end_dot_

 it will be interesting to see where this climbs to and who it comes from _meta_end_dot_

 any huckabee succcess will be interpreted as proof that he can perform outside of evangelical voters _meta_end_dot_

 rudy giuliani _meta_end_dot_

 rudy has a problem here _meta_end_dot_

 he is gone and people will notice _meta_end_dot_

 he got _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_rd of the vote of ron paul in iowa _meta_end_dot_

 if he repeats that the fundamental logic of his candidacy disappears _meta_end_dot_

 incidentally recent polling suggests that he has a similar problem in michigan fred thompson _meta_end_dot_

 fred s game is not in new hampshire _meta_end_dot_

 it is south carolina _meta_end_dot_

 he has virtually no organization and has only been here _meta_end_dot_

 twice _meta_end_question_

 he might do a drive by but no one expects him to succeed here and he is currently at the bottom of the big _meta_number_ref_ here _meta_end_dot_

 it does not look like fred s _meta_number_ref_d place iowa showing is really being reported so he is unlikely to get a real bounce here _meta_end_dot_

 ron paul _meta_end_dot_

 he could do well here _meta_end_dot_

 there is a natural crusty libertarian base here that he appeals to _meta_end_dot_

 and there is plenty of evidence of a good grassroots organization _meta_end_dot_

 but his message appears limited here _meta_end_dot_

 today i am off to romney huckabee and mccain events to see what is going on here _meta_end_dot_

 if you have ideas for questions or observations email me at soren dayton at gmail com _meta_end_dot_

 update rudy is back in new hampshire _meta_end_dot_

 he is actively campaigning through the primary _meta_end_dot_

 i ll be seeing his stuff too _meta_end_dot_
