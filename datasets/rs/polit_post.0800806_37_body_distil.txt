  california governor schwarzenegger is dealing with a self made budget crisis i told you so and so did assembly republicans as gray davis level spending increases have led to a budget deficit just as large as the one gray davis left behind _meta_end_dot_

 he s planning to deal with it by calling an emergency which can force the legislature to pass a bill to re balance the budget _meta_end_dot_

 he s formally calling for spending cuts but the democrats want to raise taxes _meta_end_dot_

 so guess what _meta_end_question_

 sacramento republicans are signing a no tax pledge says the san diego union tribune and republican votes would be needed for any democrat led tax plan _meta_end_dot_

 and we know they re going to try for a tax hike _meta_end_dot_

 read on _meta_end_dot_

 just compare these statements from speaker fabian n ez of la and republican leader michael villines of fresno _meta_end_dot_

 first the republican side villines is nice and direct identifying the problem and the solution _meta_end_dot_

 but n ez is anything but our dear speaker prefers to dance around without specifically saying what he wants to do except for his highly careful reference to threats to the state s general fund he wants to raise revenue _meta_end_dot_

 so yes i love california republicans _meta_end_dot_

 i just wish we could elect a governor someday _meta_end_dot_
