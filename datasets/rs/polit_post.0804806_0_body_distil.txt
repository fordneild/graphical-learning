  promoted by adam c good substantive local reporting on close races is high on our list of promotable material _meta_end_dot_

 this is a great example of redstate and its writers at their best _meta_end_dot_

 note this election is on march _meta_number_ref_th _meta_end_dot_

 indiana s _meta_number_ref_th congressional district in the capitol city of indianapolis has long been a graveyard for good republican candidates _meta_end_dot_

 former rep _meta_end_dot_

 julia carson acquired the seat after representative andy jacobs retired in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 the reputed carson machine defeated several strong and well financed republican candidates in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ and again after redistricting in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 after dispatching those three opponents republicans gave up on the seat and allowed a former libertarian on a dismal budget to challenge rep _meta_end_dot_

 carson in _meta_number_ref_ and then a car dealer in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 however both of these candidates saw increasing success against the carson machine _meta_end_dot_

 were it not for a series of nasty mail pieces and negative news stories about the _meta_number_ref_ candidate he may have defeated her _meta_end_dot_

 this was despite a non existent budget and no support from the struggling republican party organization in the county _meta_end_dot_

 rep _meta_end_dot_

 carson s failing health was clearly partially responsible for her scare in the _meta_number_ref_ election _meta_end_dot_

 with every expectation she would be running for re election in _meta_number_ref_ republicans encouraged incumbent killer state representative jon elrod to challenge her _meta_end_dot_

 championed because of his past ability to defeat entrenched democrat incumbents to my knowledge he was the only republican state representative to defeat an incumbent democrat in the midwest during the disastrous _meta_number_ref_ cycle optimism was growing that republicans could defeat a crumbling carson machine _meta_end_dot_

 the opportunity seemed only more clear after little known republican greg ballard defeated indianapolis mayor bart peterson in the november general election _meta_end_dot_

 this was despite being outspent _meta_number_ref_ to _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 however rep _meta_end_dot_

 carson died in december _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 the entire city mourned her _meta_end_dot_

 republicans and democrats both honored her for her service to the indianapolis community _meta_end_dot_

 julia carson s passing set up a special election to be held in march _meta_end_dot_

 because the district has been considered a democrat one kerry defeated president bush by nearly _meta_number_ref_ points in _meta_number_ref_ many democrats wanted the seat _meta_end_dot_

 the democrat caucus to select a candidate for the special election was contentious with several democrats vying for the seat _meta_end_dot_

 in the end democrats selected julia carson s grandson andre carson over several other prominent local democrats _meta_end_dot_

 the win was by just a few votes _meta_end_dot_

 you can go here to listen to many democrats gasp and grumble after the results were announced _meta_end_dot_

 several democrats have announced they already plan on challenging mr _meta_end_dot_

 carson in the regular primary election in may _meta_end_dot_

 one of them state representative david orentlicher has raised nearly _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ already for the effort _meta_end_dot_

 this has opened up the seat for a possible republican pick up next month _meta_end_dot_

 here s why i believe that this can be true for all these reasons indiana s _meta_number_ref_th should be on our radar _meta_end_dot_

 for those of you who are interested you can support rep _meta_end_dot_

 elrod by contributing to his campaign here _meta_end_dot_

 after jim ogonowski s great showing in massachusetts republicans should be paying attention to these special elections _meta_end_dot_

 with support from the rightroots candidates like jon elrod can prevail _meta_end_dot_
