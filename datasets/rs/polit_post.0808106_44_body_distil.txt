  who knows _meta_end_question_

 but after having decisively changed his political affilation it becomes a pretty interesting question as to how the artistic and literary world receives him from here on out now doesn t it _meta_end_question_

 of course when it comes to appreciating good writing i plan on putting politics as far to the side as possible _meta_end_dot_

 still mamet s change of heart makes me wonder if anyone else in the artistic and literary world will soon follow _meta_end_dot_

 i hope they will when it comes to great endeavors one can never have too many illustrious companions _meta_end_dot_

 it s nice to see that daniel henninger gave props to stoppard as well _meta_end_dot_

 he may be the wittiest and most inventive playwright around _meta_end_dot_

 and he evinces right of center libertarian tendencies _meta_end_dot_

 what s not to love _meta_end_question_

 i mean have you read travesties _meta_end_question_

 it is wonderful _meta_end_dot_
