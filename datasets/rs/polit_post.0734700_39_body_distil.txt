  we all remember the rhetoric surrounding president bush s first veto of the democrats bloated s chip bill this fall _meta_end_dot_

 h ow many children will be dead if this measure doesn t pass _meta_end_question_

 asked texas rep _meta_end_dot_

 lloyd doggett on the floor of the house _meta_end_dot_

 president bush used his cruel veto pen to say i forbid _meta_number_ref_ million children from getting the health benefits they deserve said america s mother in law speaker nancy pelosi _meta_end_dot_

 majority leader steny hoyer d md said republican votes against schip expansion and the president s veto showed a stunning lack of compassion for some of the most vulnerable members of our society and of course the venerable rep _meta_end_dot_

 pete stark d ca said on the floor of the house that the axis of evil isn t just in the middle east it s just down here on pennsylvania avenue and that the president wanted to save the money being spent on schip in order to spend it to blow up innocent people he also added his opinion immediately praised by bloggers at dailykos that president bush was sending american boys to iraq to get their heads blown off for the president s amusement it sounds like this legislation and the massive expansion of children s health care well children _meta_number_ref_ and under that it authorizes is pretty important to the democrats doesn t it _meta_end_question_

 or not _meta_end_dot_

 in reality the democrats are simply fighting for the ability to keep doing what they ve been doing this whole time using the idea of better health care for the kids as a political football something that was reinforced in spades today _meta_end_dot_

 you see congress only minutes ago received the president s latest schip veto _meta_end_dot_

 under house rules the democrat leadership now has two options and must act on one or the other immediately _meta_end_dot_

 first they can vote now to over ride sustain the president s veto second they can postpone that vote until a date certain _meta_end_dot_

 pelosi and hoyer have chosen the latter and the decision is now being debated on the house floor _meta_end_dot_

 the date they have chosen for this attempt at a veto override that will immediately save the lives of countless thousands of children _meta_end_question_

 january _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ over a month from today and not coincidentally only days before the president s state of the union address _meta_end_dot_

 read on _meta_end_dot_

 all year the newly crowned congressional leadership has quite obviously used the major issues of the day iraq troop funding health care etc to score meaningless political points rather than actually acting on things and making any real difference other than that made by empty posturing and subsequent neglect _meta_end_dot_

 this is of course nothing new _meta_end_dot_

 however it s a pretty obvious and pretty tiresome game especially in the obnoxious way that the democrats carry it out _meta_end_dot_

 take for example the comments of rep _meta_end_dot_

 james clyburn d sd in a taped interview that will air on bloomberg news tonight _meta_end_dot_

 he said the president is standing in the doorway of doctor s offices and hospitals across america and preventing children from getting the health care they need nice try mr _meta_end_dot_

 clyburn and messrs _meta_end_dot_

 hoyer doggett stark and ms _meta_end_dot_

 pelosi _meta_end_dot_

 by delaying this vote over a full month or until such a time as it can make the maximum political statement rather than a rendering the quickest and if your words are true most lifesaving verdict or b crafting a bill that the president can actually sign you have demonstrated that it is you who are standing in the doorway of a conclusion to this affair and if lives are really on the line in this schip debate then you are quite culpable indeed for those that may be lost _meta_end_dot_

 update here s what reps _meta_end_dot_

 boehner and blunt had to say in a statement released this evening
