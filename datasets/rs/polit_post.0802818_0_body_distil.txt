  o k i have a simple question sportsfans if you live in florida and support either mike huckabee or rudy giuliani for president do you stick with your man or do you go ahead and pick between mccain and romney _meta_end_question_

 it s a tough call to be sure _meta_end_dot_

 but let s face it either mccain or romney is almost certainly going to be the republican nominee _meta_end_dot_

 so do you go with your head or your heart _meta_end_question_

 suffice it to say whoever wins florida has a huge advantage going into super tuesday _meta_end_dot_

 i am not sure what i would do but i am interested to hear what others have to say especially those who live in florida _meta_end_dot_
