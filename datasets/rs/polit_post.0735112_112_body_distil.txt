 detroit s city council is a structural absurdity according to this morning s ivory tower but believe me that s not the only absurdity in the state of michigan these days _meta_end_dot_

 track down a local detroit democrat a democrat state legislator or a democrat special interest group and absurdity abounds _meta_end_dot_

 but let s start with that detroit city council and work our way from the less absurd towards utter insanity _meta_end_dot_

 the ivory tower opines this morning about the need to change the make up of the detroit city council _meta_end_dot_

 members are currently elected at large meaning there isn t necessarily any geographic representation for large portions of the city _meta_end_dot_

 and it just so happens that one of these portions is an almost exclusively hispanic part of town _meta_end_dot_

 read on _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 maybe more absurd is a neat little story in the detroit news highlighting a program inside the city of detroit that provides loans for small businesses _meta_end_dot_

 the loans are funded by the three detroit casinos as a part of their development agreement with the city _meta_end_dot_

 but i have to ask _meta_end_dot_

 why on earth would a small business need a loan _meta_end_question_

 didn t we just pass a massive democrat tax hike that took _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ billion out of the local economy and away from small businesses _meta_end_question_

 wouldn t it stand to reason that they are rolling in the cash _meta_end_question_

 i mean the governor and andy dillon and their cronies in the democrat caucus all claim that they care about the state s economy right _meta_end_question_

 and that that s their number one priority _meta_end_dot_

 and if that s true then that record setting tax hike must be good for the economy _meta_end_dot_

 right _meta_end_question_

 yeah _meta_end_dot_

 wrong _meta_end_dot_

 now read this excerpt from the news and every time you see the word loan imagine it says tax break alright now go back and re read it and insert tax hike for loan _meta_end_dot_

 doesn t work the same way does it _meta_end_dot_

 could that be because tax hike s don t aid small businesses _meta_end_question_

 and that if you want a company to grow and create jobs you need to let them have access to more capital not less _meta_end_question_

 i know _meta_end_dot_

 absurd _meta_end_dot_

 but nothing compared to the happenings last week in the democrats ongoing efforts to repeal michigan s fda defense law in favor of ambulance chasers and personal injury lawyers statewide _meta_end_dot_

 the trial lawyer enhancement act moved through the house months ago but the senate continues to stop them from killing tens of thousands of life science jobs _meta_end_dot_

 but that hasn t stopped the democrats from attempting to demagogue the issue _meta_end_dot_

 i d say demagogue it to death but some might say that s cruel and heartless they claim that the repeal is necessary so that patients who ve been on the wrong side of an fda approved drug will have the right to sue _meta_end_dot_

 in other words they claim that they don t already have that right today _meta_end_dot_

 and they ve got a teary eyed housewife who lost her husband some years ago running around the state telling folks that she s not allowed to sue _meta_end_dot_

 except _meta_end_dot_

 turns out she wasn t being entirely honest with us _meta_end_dot_

 she has sued and she s in line to recover damages _meta_end_exclamation_

 according to the associated press i m not sure what s more absurd about this story _meta_end_dot_

 that this poor woman who unquestionably suffered a terrible life shattering heart breaking loss was willing to go on tv and lie or the fact that the michigan democrats so eagerly took advantage of her grief and turned her into their own little made for tv puppet _meta_end_dot_

 i can understand the impulse to lash out in grief _meta_end_dot_

 that s natural _meta_end_dot_

 and it can impair judgment _meta_end_dot_

 but the dems have no such excuse _meta_end_dot_

 they were aware of the fact that the woman had in fact sued the company when she claimed she couldn t under michigan law _meta_end_dot_

 they were aware of the fact that she stood to recover damages _meta_end_dot_

 they used her a grieving widow _meta_end_dot_

 and they continue to use her _meta_end_dot_

 that s not just absurd it s heartless br
