  vice president kay bailey hutchison _meta_end_dot_

 the possibility of john mccain selecting the texas senator as his running mate is floating out there somewhere _meta_end_dot_

 when i studied political science in school we were taught the veep candidates were chosen because they could balance a ticket ideologically or geographically or because they could carry a prized state _meta_end_dot_

 those are old school rules but i assume they are still in vogue if we add a gravitas balance rule _meta_end_dot_

 other factors like age sex race rural v _meta_end_dot_

 urban experience with congress issue strengths criminal record etc are also factors _meta_end_dot_

 the ideological balance rule might be important here if john mccain wants to convince those who believe he is not conservative enough by choosing someone whom they believe is conservative enough but it seems that a candidate s conservatism is now a matter of gut feeling and opinion than anything objective _meta_end_dot_

 the american conservative union has a popular rating system in which they measure a candidates conservatism by how often the senator for our purposes agrees with the acu on specific issues legislation chosen by the acu _meta_end_dot_

 in his career john mccain has agreed with the acu on acu selected issues _meta_number_ref_ _meta_percent_ref_ of the time _meta_end_dot_

 kay bailey hutchison has agreed with the acu on acu selected issues _meta_number_ref_ _meta_percent_ref_ of the time _meta_end_dot_

 for sake of reference arlen specter has voted with the acu on their selected issues only _meta_number_ref_ _meta_percent_ref_ of the time in his career _meta_end_dot_

 hillary just nine percent so by the acu s criteria hutchison does not balance mccain ideologically with both leaning heavily conservative _meta_end_dot_

 it gets more fun _meta_end_dot_

 read on david hill writes in the hill newspaper now my conservative gut reaction rules her out _meta_end_dot_

 granted my recovery from cancer treatment has done a number on my conservative gut but it had earlier objected to john mccain as the republican nominee and has been overridden by my conservative noggin s reaction _meta_end_dot_

 i m willing to think about hutchison and since i have access to the smartest political minds on the internet i ask you to have at it _meta_end_dot_

 a caveat _meta_end_dot_

 neither tim russert nor george stephanopoulos has demanded a shermanesque statement from her but senator hutchison has ruled out such a run as mccain s veep _meta_end_dot_

 oh that s not shermanesque _meta_end_dot_

 if she s asked sounds like she just might do it _meta_end_dot_

 she d guarantee mccain texas but running against obama or hillary that one is a no brainer anyway _meta_end_dot_

 the geographical balance is nil _meta_end_dot_

 then again club for growth rated her at _meta_percent_ref_ on pork for _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 i guess she balances john mccain who rated a perfect _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_end_dot_
