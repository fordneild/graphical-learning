  the ellipses at the beginning of this post s title are intended as a continuation of the subtitle of this excellent post from earlier today _meta_end_dot_

 well done as always charles _meta_end_dot_

 note photographs from the meeting mentioned below are available here during the year that general petraeus and his counterinsurgency force have been on the ground in iraq the concerned local citizens program until recently a tiny localized neighborhood watch equivalent has grown into a nationwide phenomenon _meta_end_dot_

 called basically a thumb in the eye at a maliki government that won t get its act together by one american officer whose unit i spent time with in august the concerned local citizens program puts ground level security in the hands of the individual tribes and groups who need it most _meta_end_dot_

 under the program s coalition crafted guidelines members of individual tribes are allowed to arm themselves and to conduct their own security operations and patrols provided that among other requirements they submit to the authority of coalition and iraqi security forces _meta_end_dot_

 read on _meta_end_dot_

 the main premise behind the concerned local citizens program is simply the belief that iraqis as a whole oppose the militias and terrorist groups that have plagued iraq for the last several years and that citizen empowerment backed by the coalition will lead to a rejection of the forces that terrorize the civilian population in a given area _meta_end_dot_

 the idea was borne out of the anbar awakening which saw tribal leaders and citizens rise up and band together to fight against al qaeda in iraq _meta_end_dot_

 fed up with those who offered in the words of one tribal sheik only death the leaders of anbar s tribes despite historical enmities joined forces with the coalition and with each other to drive al qaeda from their territory _meta_end_dot_

 following this uprising the awakening blossomed into a grassroots movement to rebuild and reunite anbar province around a free and independent network of tribes and clans _meta_end_dot_

 when general petraeus returned to iraq this year as commander of multinational force iraq one of his goals was to replicate the astonishing success of the anbar awakening throughout rest of the country _meta_end_dot_

 using the awakening as an example coalition units began to meet with tribal leaders in different areas of iraq encouraging them to augment the iraqi security forces and to stand up to the militias and terrorist groups threatening them _meta_end_dot_

 it was expected that there would be some interest in the program especially among tribes sitting on the wrong side of their areas sectarian divides _meta_end_dot_

 what was not expected though was what a phenomenon the clc program would become nor how rapidly it would become so _meta_end_dot_

 in the last six months what began as an extremely localized occurrence has spread across the entire width of the nation and clc groups are established or forming in every one of iraq s _meta_number_ref_ provinces except for the northernmost and southernmost three _meta_end_dot_

 due to effective provincial security forces these six do not currently need such citizen s groups _meta_end_dot_

 over _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ iraqis are now members of concerned local citizens groups nationwide at this time a remarkable development _meta_end_dot_

 when in the small sunni village of ja ara between baghdad and salman pak this summer i had the privilege of sitting in on the very first meeting between an american officer and a tribal leader at which the prospect of establishing a prototype concerned citizens group the first ever in the region was discussed _meta_end_dot_

 if we can get them going with their own security and the other tribes around them can see what a good thing they have and decide that they want it too then we could see a serious improvement in this area captain rich thompson commander of baker company _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ infantry told me just before we departed combat outpost cahill to meet the tribal sheik _meta_end_dot_

 i don t want insurgents and terrorists in my ao area of operations thompson explained _meta_end_dot_

 i don t care where they go as long as they re not here and if everybody takes that attitude iraqis and soldiers alike and works for that goal then sooner or later there won t be any place for the insurgents to go that was at the end of august _meta_end_dot_

 what began as the smallest of meetings has in the mere three months since grown with greater rapidity that i or anyone else could ever have imagined _meta_end_dot_

 as of the beginning of this month there were over _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ concerned local citizens just in that small region baghdad province _meta_end_dot_

 further almost half of the _meta_number_ref_ clc groups there are combined sunni and shi a a remarkable fact that speaks to the unity that is made possible by the possession of a common enemy which has slowly but surely been driven out of the area _meta_end_dot_

 the most common argument made against the concerned local citizen program is that it encourages vigilante justice and undercuts the iraqi government and its official security forces _meta_end_dot_

 however despite its initial lack of support for the program the iraqi government has grown to embrace the assistance given to its security forces by these volunteers and according to a spokesman for the ministry of the interior all of these tribal fighters in the different iraqi provinces will be merged into the police forces at some point in the future _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ of the original anbar based citizen soldiers have been added to the rolls of the iraqi security forces in the last year and in the past six months _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ more from elsewhere in the country have completed police or army training and are now serving their homeland as official representatives of the armed forces _meta_end_dot_

 what began in anbar a year ago has now spread to the whole of iraq _meta_end_dot_

 i witnessed its beginning in baghdad province only months ago since then tribe after tribe in that area and in others around the country have seen what their neighboring tribes are able to accomplish with their own coalition sanctioned self conducted security forces and have decided to participate in the effort themselves _meta_end_dot_

 sometimes it only takes the slightest catalyst to get the ball rolling _meta_end_dot_

 if this continues at a rate anywhere near that with which it began this year then it may be possible at some point in the not too distant future to realistically speak of a state of affairs in iraq in which to paraphrase captain thompson there simply isn t anywhere for the insurgents to go
