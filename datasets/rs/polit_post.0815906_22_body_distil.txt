  with the sudden jump in unemployment to _meta_number_ref_ _meta_percent_ref_ still relatively mild but certainly noticeably more than the previous _meta_percent_ref_ figure fears will naturally increase that the united states is or will soon be in a recession _meta_end_dot_

 and the more such fears increase the greater the propensity as daniel griswold points out for public officials to blame free trade for our economic woes _meta_end_dot_

 problem is that such scapegoating is complete and total bunk free trade recessions would be more common longer lasting and more devastating in scope and impact _meta_end_dot_

 thanks to liberalized markets we are able to augment periods of economic growth and lessen both the frequency and the destructive capacity of recessionary periods _meta_end_dot_

 we are not of course able to repeal the business cycle but we would not have nearly the economic prosperity and the cushion against the occasional recessionary period that we have now if it were not for free trade _meta_end_dot_

 just something to remember when you go into the voting booth and consider whether you really want to vote for a protectionist candidate for the presidency _meta_end_dot_

 not to mention fellow protectionists in that candidate s political party _meta_end_dot_
