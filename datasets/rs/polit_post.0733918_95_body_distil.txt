  rush does not endorse in primaries _meta_end_dot_

 i can t say i blame him _meta_end_dot_

 but he does know a conservative when he sees one and he s already said that thompson is the only conservative in the race without well rush was singing fred s praises again _meta_end_dot_

 but as rush did let me point out that it is not so much what fred said though to be sure it was staggering in its conservative awesomeness but the way charlie rose reacted _meta_end_dot_

 you can watch the whole clip below the fold but here is the relevant part from the transcript rose asks you constantly say in this campaign that you are a conservative _meta_end_dot_

 what does that mean today thompson s response and rose is just stunned _meta_end_dot_

 stunned _meta_end_dot_

 no gay marriage _meta_end_dot_

 no abortion _meta_end_dot_

 no gun rights _meta_end_dot_

 none of that in that statement _meta_end_dot_

 thompson explains that those are issues to which you apply your principles _meta_end_dot_

 go to kerrhome s diary for the rest and go below the fold for my take and the video _meta_end_dot_

 read on _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 you know i admit fred hasn t done well on the stump but let s not fool around on the issue of what he believes _meta_end_dot_

 he has been consistent _meta_end_dot_

 fred pimping however is not my point _meta_end_dot_

 charlie rose s response is my point _meta_end_dot_

 rose was just befuddled by fred _meta_end_dot_

 and isn t that interesting _meta_end_dot_

 you see liberals in general are befuddled by principle _meta_end_dot_

 they were confounded by reagan _meta_end_dot_

 they are confounded by bush _meta_end_dot_

 and they are confounded by a man like fred thompson _meta_end_dot_

 conservatives see the world in the form of principles by which we lead our lives _meta_end_dot_

 thompson to his credit when he first ran put out a list of principles not policy statements or action items or anything else principles by which he would govern _meta_end_dot_

 liberals can t do that _meta_end_dot_

 they have no principles any more _meta_end_dot_

 the only principle they have is the accumulation of power _meta_end_dot_

 that s it _meta_end_dot_

 that s the only principle _meta_end_dot_

 sadly too many republicans lately have adopted that principle _meta_end_dot_

 they go wobbly _meta_end_dot_

 liberals hate hypocrites because hypocrites set standards and fail to meet them _meta_end_dot_

 hypocrisy is the only sin to liberals because the existence of hypocrisy means there are principles and standards from which one might deviate _meta_end_dot_

 and charlie rose shows that off _meta_end_dot_

 to him principles are gay marriage abortion guns etc _meta_end_dot_

 to a principled conservative those are issues sometimes when principle is applied to them a conservative comes out with majority opinion and sometimes not _meta_end_dot_

 a liberal sees issues as principles because positions on issues can shift _meta_end_dot_

 hopefully for the liberal they always shift left _meta_end_dot_

 principles do not shift _meta_end_dot_

 sometimes they are balanced _meta_end_dot_

 sometimes they are prioritized but they do not shift _meta_end_dot_

 and liberals cannot abide that because a fixed principle yields hypocrisy when one crosses the line _meta_end_dot_

 so liberals talk of issues as principles and shift them further and further left so no one must risk being a hypocrite _meta_end_dot_

 liberals can win on issues but they can t win on principles because the if it feels good do it and let the government pay for it principle is abhorrent to the rugged individualist streak that runs through the majority of americans _meta_end_dot_

 says thompson on that point p
