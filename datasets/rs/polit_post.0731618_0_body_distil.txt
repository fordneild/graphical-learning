  there is only one real possible response to this nonsense by frank rich the coup at home forsooth h t jules crittenden and aoshq _meta_end_dot_

 specifically the bit about how we re a people in clinical depression no i will not apologize _meta_end_dot_

 this is precisely the response that rich needs _meta_end_dot_

 this is clinical treatment _meta_end_dot_

 read on _meta_end_dot_

 personally i blame this travesty of an article on what can be best described as the journalistic equivalent of a virgin field epidemic _meta_end_dot_

 i refer of course to timesselect while they may have thought that they were increasing the value of their product by keeping the proles with their keyboards and bad attitudes from seeing any of it what they were actually doing was wrecking the immune system of any poor so and so who got trapped writing behind the nyt subscription wall _meta_end_dot_

 frank rich must have been gasping for both breath and attention by the time that the wall went down _meta_end_dot_

 the merits and i m being kind by giving it scare quotes for the record of the article can be dismissed fairly quickly jules did the heavy lifting so i wouldn t have to _meta_end_dot_

 suffice it to say that we are not in the process of having some sort of creeping coup at home _meta_end_dot_

 if we were we would be seeing some of the events going on in pakistan going on in the united states _meta_end_dot_

 which would include things happening to people like frank rich in order to shut him up _meta_end_dot_

 granted the easiest way that i can think of to effectively shut him up would be to reinstate timesselect but that s just humoring his worldview _meta_end_dot_

 you know something _meta_end_question_

 it s rainy as all get out we had a power failure last night and i need to get the house cleaned and it s still a beautiful morning _meta_end_dot_

 just saying frank _meta_end_dot_

 welcome back to the world by the way and just think of all of this as you getting your booster shots _meta_end_dot_
