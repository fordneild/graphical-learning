  i don t doubt for a moment that the media remains largely in the tank for barack obama _meta_end_dot_

 but despite or perhaps because of that fact the obama campaign s decision to opt out of public financing has earned him nothing but scorn from the editorial pages obama s supposed beliefs concerning this issue what we are increasingly seeing is that barack obama far from being a breath of fresh air is an entirely ordinary politician _meta_end_dot_

 which is fine by the way _meta_end_dot_

 many of us have learned to expect nothing more than ordinariness from our political class _meta_end_dot_

 but obama should never have advertised himself as being something different than what he actually is _meta_end_dot_
