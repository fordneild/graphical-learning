  it does have to be said ladies and gentlemen _meta_end_dot_

 it has to be said _meta_end_dot_

 ron paul took over _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ votes in iowa and _meta_percent_ref_ of the vote _meta_end_dot_

 he bested rudy giuliani duncan hunter and alan keyes _meta_end_dot_

 we can all say what we will about his supporters but the guy has a core loyal group ready to wade through snow to phone for him _meta_end_dot_

 congrats ron _meta_end_dot_

 i expect a similar showing in new hampshire _meta_end_dot_
