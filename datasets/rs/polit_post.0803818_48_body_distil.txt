  george allen is introducing john mccain _meta_end_dot_

 he says they don t agree on everything but john mccain has been a fighter on wasteful spending taxes the line item veto life etc _meta_end_dot_

 the crowd really likes george allen _meta_end_dot_

 now he s said he supports john mccain and the crowd goes nuts _meta_end_dot_

 and now tom coburn comes on stage _meta_end_dot_

 coburn says john may not always tells us what we want to here but what he tells us he will do _meta_end_dot_

 we won t have things switched on us when he gets in the white house he says mccain will take on terror and take on the looming financial catastrophe facing our nation the fact is we have not had a president these last eight years willing to take on democrats and republicans in congress to cut wasteful duplicate spending the crowd applauds _meta_end_dot_

 no presidential agenda no matter how conservative survives congress _meta_end_dot_

 it fades out here _meta_end_dot_

 coburn sucks at speaking directly into the microphone _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 warm the hearts of the taxpayers _meta_end_dot_

 due to the failure of congress i don t know that we ve had a comprehensive gop conservative agenda since _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 most republicans were marching off the bridge _meta_end_dot_

 john mccain stayed on it and fought john mccain fought the largest entitlement expansion since lyndon johnson the bush medicare plan _meta_end_dot_

 conservative criticism of mccain wasn t there when he was fighting that plan coburn continues _meta_end_dot_

 john mccain will get the government and insurance companies out of the doctor patient relationship coburn points out that mccain voted for bork thomas roberts alito janice rogers brown etc _meta_end_dot_

 i also knows he wants us to be approving conservative judges now he doesn t have a secret plan to push amnesty as president then he takes on mccain over bcra and says they disagree but no one can disagree that mccain is committed to rooting out corruption _meta_end_dot_

 john mccain has a conservative record on the most important issue of our time the sanctity of life he then introduces john mccain and the crowd roars applause _meta_end_dot_

 the mccain speech is below the fold _meta_end_dot_

 mccain deviates from the text to praise mitt romney thank him and say nice things _meta_end_dot_

 you are welcome to join my campaign based on conservative principles _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 a great and fine man _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 thank you _meta_end_dot_

 thank you for inviting me _meta_end_dot_

 it s been a little while since i ve had the honor of addressing you and i appreciate very much your courtesy to me today _meta_end_dot_

 we should do this more often _meta_end_dot_

 i hope you will pardon my absence last year and understand that i intended no personal insult to any of you _meta_end_dot_

 i was merely pre occupied with the business of trying to escape the distinction of pre season frontrunner for the republican nomination which i m sure some of you observed i managed to do in fairly short order _meta_end_dot_

 but now i again have the privilege of that distinction and this time i would prefer to hold on to it for a while _meta_end_dot_

 i know i have a responsibility if i am as i hope to be the republican nominee for president to unite the party and prepare for the great contest in november _meta_end_dot_

 and i am acutely aware that i cannot succeed in that endeavor nor can our party prevail over the challenge we will face from either senator clinton or senator obama without the support of dedicated conservatives whose convictions creativity and energy have been indispensible to the success our party has had over the last quarter century _meta_end_dot_

 many of you have disagreed strongly with some positions i have taken in recent years _meta_end_dot_

 i understand that _meta_end_dot_

 i might not agree with it but i respect it for the principled position it is _meta_end_dot_

 and it is my sincere hope that even if you believe i have occasionally erred in my reasoning as a fellow conservative you will still allow that i have in many ways important to all of us maintained the record of a conservative _meta_end_dot_

 further i hope you will grant that i have defended many positions we share just as ardently as i have made my case for positions that have provoked your opposition _meta_end_dot_

 if not thank you for this opportunity to make my case today _meta_end_dot_

 i am proud to be a conservative and i make that claim because i share with you that most basic of conservative principles that liberty is a right conferred by our creator not by governments and that the proper object of justice and the rule of law in our country is not to aggregate power to the state but to protect the liberty and property of its citizens _meta_end_dot_

 and like you i understand as edmund burke observed that whenever a separation is made between liberty and justice neither _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 is safe while i have long worked to help grow a public majority of support for republican candidates and principles i have also always believed like you in the wisdom of ronald reagan who warned in an address to this conference in _meta_number_ref_ that a political party cannot be all things to all people _meta_end_dot_

 it must represent certain fundamental beliefs which must not be compromised to political expediency or simply to swell its numbers i attended my first cpac conference as the invited guest of ronald reagan not long after i had returned from overseas when i heard him deliver his shining city upon a hill speech _meta_end_dot_

 i was still a naval officer then but his words inspired and helped form my own political views just as ronald reagan s defense of america s cause in vietnam and his evident concern for american prisoners of war in that conflict inspired and were a great comfort to those of us who in my friend jerry denton s words had the honor of serving our country under difficult circumstances i am proud very proud to have come to public office as a foot soldier in the reagan revolution _meta_end_dot_

 and if a few of my positions have raised your concern that i have forgotten my political heritage i want to assure you that i have not and i am as proud of that association today as i was then _meta_end_dot_

 my record in public office taken as a whole is the record of a mainstr eam conservative _meta_end_dot_

 i believe today as i believed twenty five years ago in small government fiscal discipline low taxes a strong defense judges who enforce and not make our laws the social values that are the true source of our strength and generally the steadfast defense of our rights to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness which i have defended my entire career as god given to the born and unborn _meta_end_dot_

 those are my beliefs and you need not examine only my past votes and speeches to assure yourselves that they are my genuine convictions _meta_end_dot_

 you can take added confidence from the positions i have defended during this campaign _meta_end_dot_

 i campaigned in iowa in opposition to agriculture subsidies _meta_end_dot_

 i campaigned in new hampshire against big government mandated health care and for a free market solution to the problem of unavailable and unaffordable health care _meta_end_dot_

 i campaigned in michigan for the tax incentives and trade policies that will create new and better jobs in that economically troubled state _meta_end_dot_

 i campaigned in florida against the national catastrophic insurance fund bill that passed the house of representatives and defended my opposition to the prescription drug benefit bill that saddled americans with yet another hugely expensive entitlement program _meta_end_dot_

 i have argued to make the bush tax cuts permanent to reduce the corporate tax rate and abolish the amt _meta_end_dot_

 i have defended my position on protecting our second amendment rights including my votes against waiting periods bans on the so called assault weapons and illegitimate lawsuits targeting gun manufacturers _meta_end_dot_

 i have proudly defended my twenty four year pro life record _meta_end_dot_

 throughout this campaign i have defended the president s brave decision to increase troop levels in iraq to execute a long overdue counterinsurgency that has spared us the terrible calamity of losing that war _meta_end_dot_

 i held these positions because i believed they were in the best interests of my party and country surely i have held other positions that have not met with widespread agreement from conservatives _meta_end_dot_

 i won t pretend otherwise nor would you permit me to forget it _meta_end_dot_

 on the issue of illegal immigration a position which provoked the outspoken opposition of many conservatives i stood my ground aware that my position would imperil my campaign _meta_end_dot_

 i respect your opposition for i know that the vast majority of critics to the bill based their opposition in a principled defense of the rule of law _meta_end_dot_

 and while i and other republican supporters of the bill were genuine in our intention to restore control of our borders we failed for various and understandable reasons to convince americans that we were _meta_end_dot_

 i accept that and have pledged that it would be among my highest priorities to secure our borders first and only after we achieved widespread consensus that our borders are secure would we address other aspects of the problem in a wa y that defends the rule of law and does not encourage another wave of illegal immigration _meta_end_dot_

 all i ask of any american conservative moderate independent or enlightened democrat is to judge my record as a whole and accept that i am not in the habit of making promises to my country that i do not intend to keep _meta_end_dot_

 i hope i have proven that in my life even to my critics _meta_end_dot_

 then vote for or against me based on that record my qualifications for the office and the direction where i plainly state i intend to lead our country _meta_end_dot_

 if i am so fortunate as to be the republican nominee for president i will offer americans in what will be a very challenging and spirited contest a clearly conservative approach to governing _meta_end_dot_

 i will make my case to voters no matter what state they reside in in the same way _meta_end_dot_

 i will not obscure my positions from voters who i fear might not share them _meta_end_dot_

 i will stand on my convictions my conservative convictions and trust in the good sense of the voters and in my confidence that conservative pr inciples still appeal to a majority of americans republicans independents and reagan democrats _meta_end_dot_

 often elections in this country are fought within the margins of small differences _meta_end_dot_

 this one will not be _meta_end_dot_

 we are arguing about hugely consequential things _meta_end_dot_

 whomever the democrats nominate they would govern this country in a way that will in my opinion take this country backward to the days when government felt empowered to take from us our freedom to decide for ourselves the course and quality of our lives to substitute the muddled judgment of large and expanding federal bureaucracies for the common sense and values of the american people to the timidity and wishful thinking of a time when we averted our eyes from terrible threats to our security that were so plainly gathering strength abroad _meta_end_dot_

 it is shameful and dangerous that senate democrats are blocking an extension of surveillance powers that enable our intelligence and law enforcement to defend our country against radical islamic extremists _meta_end_dot_

 this election is going to be about big things not small things _meta_end_dot_

 and i intend to fight as hard as i can to ensure that our principles prevail over theirs _meta_end_dot_

 senator clinton and senator obama want to increase the size of the federal government _meta_end_dot_

 i intend to reduce it _meta_end_dot_

 i will not sign a bill with earmarks in it any earmarks in it _meta_end_dot_

 i will fight for the line item veto and i will not permit any expansion whatsoever of the entitlement programs that are bankrupting us _meta_end_dot_

 on the contrary i intend to reform those programs so that government is no longer in that habit of making promises to americans it does not have the means to keep _meta_end_dot_

 senator clinton and senator obama will raise your taxes _meta_end_dot_

 i intend to cut them _meta_end_dot_

 i will start by making the bush tax cuts permanent _meta_end_dot_

 i will cut corporate tax rates from _meta_number_ref_ to _meta_percent_ref_ to keep industries and jobs in this country _meta_end_dot_

 i will end the alternate minimum tax _meta_end_dot_

 and i won t let a democratic congress raise your taxes and choke the growth of our economy _meta_end_dot_

 they will offer a big government solution to health care insurance coverage _meta_end_dot_

 i intend to address the problem with free market solutions and with respect for the freedom of individuals to make important choices for themselves _meta_end_dot_

 they will appoint to the federal bench judges who are intent on achieving political changes that the american people cannot be convinced to accept through the election of their representatives _meta_end_dot_

 i intend to nominate judges who have proven themselves worthy of our trust that they take as their sole responsibility the enforcement of laws made by the people s elected representatives judges of the character and quality of justices roberts and alito judges who can be relied upon to respect the values of the people whose rights laws and property they are sworn to defend _meta_end_dot_

 senator clinton and senator obama will withdraw our forces from iraq based on an arbitrary timetable designed for the sake of political expediency and which recklessly ignores the profound human calamity and dire threats to our security that would ensue _meta_end_dot_

 i intend to win the war and trust in the proven judgment of our commanders there and the courage and selflessness of the americans they have the honor to command _meta_end_dot_

 i share the grief over the terrible losses we have suffered in its prosecution _meta_end_dot_

 there is no other candidate for this office who appreciates more than i do just how awful war is _meta_end_dot_

 but i know that the costs in lives and treasure we would incur should we fail in iraq will be far greater than the heartbreaking losses we have suffered to date _meta_end_dot_

 and i will not allow that to happen _meta_end_dot_

 they won t recognize and seriously address the threat posed by an iran with nuclear ambitions to our ally israel and the region _meta_end_dot_

 i intend to make unmistakably clear to iran we will not permit a government that espouses the destruction of the state of israel as its fondest wish and pledges undying enmity to the united states to possess the weapons to advance their malevolent ambitions _meta_end_dot_

 senator clinton and senator obama will concede to our critics that our own actions to defend against its threats are responsible for fomenting the terrible evil of radical islamic extremism and their resolve to combat it will be as flawed as their judgment _meta_end_dot_

 i intend to defeat that threat by staying on offense and by marshaling every relevant agency of our government and our allies in the urgent necessity of defending the values virtues and security of free people against those who despise all that is good about us _meta_end_dot_

 these are but a few of the differences that will define this election _meta_end_dot_

 they are very significant differences and i promise you i intend to contest these issues on conservative grounds and fight as hard as i can to defend the principles and positions we share and to keep this country safe proud prosperous and free _meta_end_dot_

 we have had a few disagreements and none of us will pretend that we won t continue to have a few _meta_end_dot_

 but even in disagreement especially in disagreement i will seek the counsel of my fellow conservatives _meta_end_dot_

 if i am convinced my judgment is in error i will correct it _meta_end_dot_

 and if i stand by my position even after benefit of your counsel i hope you will not lose sight of the far more numerous occasions when we are in complete accord _meta_end_dot_

 i began by assuring you that we share a conception of liberty that is the bedrock of our beliefs as conservatives _meta_end_dot_

 as you know i was deprived of liberty for a time in my life and while my love of liberty is no greater than yours you can be confident that mine is the equal of any american s _meta_end_dot_

 it is a deep and unwavering love _meta_end_dot_

 my life experiences in service to our country inform my political judgments _meta_end_dot_

 they are at the core of my convictions _meta_end_dot_

 i am pro life and an advocate for the rights of man everywhere in the world because of them because i know that to be denied liberty is an offense to nature and nature s creator _meta_end_dot_

 i will never waver in that conviction i promise you _meta_end_dot_

 i know in this country our liberty will not be seized in a political revolution or by a totalitarian government _meta_end_dot_

 but rather as burke warned it can be nibbled away for expedience and by parts i am alert to that risk and will defend against it and ta ke comfort from the knowledge that i will be encouraged in that defense by my fellow conservatives _meta_end_dot_

 you have heard me say before that for all my reputation as a maverick i have only found true happiness in serving a cause greater than my self interest _meta_end_dot_

 for me that cause has always been our country and the ideals that have made us great _meta_end_dot_

 i have been her imperfect servant for many years and i have made many mistakes _meta_end_dot_

 you can attest to that but need not _meta_end_dot_

 for i know them well myself _meta_end_dot_

 but i love her deeply and i will never never tire of the honor of serving her _meta_end_dot_

 i cannot do that without your counsel and support _meta_end_dot_

 and i am grateful very grateful that you have given me this opportunity to ask for it _meta_end_dot_

 thank you and god bless you _meta_end_dot_
