  story here _meta_end_dot_

 the united arab emirates hosted their own airshow this weekend and they announced a deal to buy airbus products with a nominal value over _meta_dollor_ref_ billion _meta_end_dot_

 our hometown team the boeing commercial airplanes division got a much smaller order from emirates _meta_end_dot_

 this story is noteworthy for several reasons _meta_end_dot_

 update the central bank governor of the united arab emirates was quoted as saying that several gulf states also including kuwait may abandon their domestic currency pegs to the us dollar _meta_end_dot_

 since these countries get paid for oil in dollars but import goods mostly from europe the weak dollar is generating big inflation for them _meta_end_dot_

 more _meta_end_dot_

 why are people obsessed with airliners and purchases of airliners _meta_end_question_

 partly because air travel is one of the key indicators of the economic dynamism of any nation _meta_end_dot_

 partly because large airframe manufacturing is a high tech business that creates lots of great jobs _meta_end_dot_

 and partly because airlines airliners and air travel are just so darned glamorous _meta_end_dot_

 of course if you live in the united states commercial air travel will strike you as pretty far from glamorous _meta_end_dot_

 in fact it s probably close to the last thing you d ever want to do _meta_end_dot_

 the total broken ness of civil aviation in the us is part of the story first let s look at airbus _meta_end_dot_

 this is a company that has had no end of trouble in the last couple of years and on nearly every front _meta_end_dot_

 they had engineering and production problems that delayed their a_meta_number_ref_ and a_meta_number_ref_ platforms _meta_end_dot_

 the a_meta_number_ref_ is critical because it will compete against boeing s new _meta_number_ref_ product _meta_end_dot_

 it s hoped that the a_meta_number_ref_ a four engine superjumbo will open up new markets in asia over the next few decades that boeing will not be competitive in _meta_end_dot_

 airbus execution problems have inevitably led to financial difficulties and layoffs several reorgs and the departure of a ceo _meta_end_dot_

 this year they claim they have been hurt badly by the sharp appreciation of the euro which gives boeing a cost advantage all else equal _meta_end_dot_

 of course all else is not equal as french and german taxpayers are known to have subsidized the financing of airbus planes _meta_end_dot_

 if you perked up your eyebrows when you heard french president nicolas sarkozy speak of economic war in congress last week now you know what he was talking about _meta_end_dot_

 and more recently senior airbus executives have gotten themselves messed up with accusations of insider trading _meta_end_dot_

 tsk tsk _meta_end_dot_

 execution and currency problems are one thing _meta_end_dot_

 but malfeasance by management is just shooting yourself in the foot _meta_end_dot_

 nevertheless the biggest thing about the airliner business is your strategic marketing _meta_end_dot_

 that s because your product cycles are measured in decades so there s no margin for error _meta_end_dot_

 and airbus large load long haul strategy just got a huge vote of confidence with the enormous order from emirates _meta_end_dot_

 they have committed to buy enough of the a_meta_number_ref_ to firmly launch that product and a few more a_meta_number_ref_s in addition to their previous orders for the superjumbo _meta_end_dot_

 boeing came up short as their new airframes and general electric s engine offerings didn t match emirates requirements _meta_end_dot_

 this isn t good news for the hometown team which has now lost its position as the world s number one airplane manufacturer _meta_end_dot_

 they will get some market share back when their new _meta_number_ref_ versions come on line late next year but they ll have to scramble _meta_end_dot_

 now what s the story with the united arab emirates _meta_end_question_

 they re among the few oil states with the ambition to use their resource wealth to actually create real economies _meta_end_dot_

 their drive to become a global transport hub is part of the rationale for a huge all new fleet of long haul airliners _meta_end_dot_

 you really have to admire the way that dubai has risen from desert sand as a soon to be world class city _meta_end_dot_

 they re doing a lot of things right _meta_end_dot_

 they re well integrated into the coming global economy _meta_end_dot_

 they re still pro american even though congress insists on kicking them in the teeth periodically _meta_end_dot_

 and they will be one of the key behind the scenes players in the ongoing war on terror _meta_end_dot_

 like saudi arabia emirates have a pretty good thing going with the whole energy export thing _meta_end_dot_

 the very last thing they need is a bunch of hard core weirdos in iran to go nuclear promote terrorism destabilize arab populations and fart in everyone s airlocks _meta_end_dot_

 but the saudis are just trying to keep a lid on things as they are _meta_end_dot_

 the emirates are going at it in a much healthier way _meta_end_dot_

 where does that leave boeing commercial airplanes _meta_end_question_

 hey wait a minute _meta_end_dot_

 didn t congress in their infinite wisdom put the kibosh on a bid by dubai world ports to manage harbor facilities in the united states _meta_end_question_

 do you suppose that had anything to do with emirates decision to favor airbus over boeing _meta_end_question_

 naaaaaaaah couldn t be _meta_end_dot_

 could it _meta_end_question_
