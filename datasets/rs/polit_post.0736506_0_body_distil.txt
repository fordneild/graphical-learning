  hi _meta_end_dot_

 do you own a mp_meta_number_ref_ player _meta_end_question_

 do you use it for car trips gym visits commutes or just as a substitute for a rather bulky stereo system _meta_end_question_

 do you have any of your legally bought cds on that mp_meta_number_ref_ player _meta_end_question_

 wait _meta_end_exclamation_

 don t answer that last one because if the answer s yes and some lawyer for the riaa sees it they ll sue you for copyright infringement _meta_end_dot_

 i am not making this up via glenn _meta_end_dot_

 read on _meta_end_dot_

 i really do sympathize with the record industry _meta_end_dot_

 really i do _meta_end_dot_

 i imagine that the hooker and cocaine markets in california are probably over saturated with too many buyers and not enough sellers so it must be difficult for your average record executive to maintain proper levels of mechanistic sex and illegal drug use while on a fixed budget _meta_end_dot_

 they really can t raise album prices all that much more and there s a limit to how much you can steal from even a pop musician before he or she starts noticing so a revenue drop is nothing short of a catastrophe for these guys _meta_end_dot_

 which is probably why this entire digital media thing freaks them completely out _meta_end_dot_

 it s already bad enough that less people are buying their rather sloppy music imagine the disaster if people could hear the stuff in advance _meta_end_dot_

 but still _meta_end_dot_

 do you guys over at the riaa really want to mess with america s ipods _meta_end_question_

 isn t there something about that i don t know sets off alarm bells or something _meta_end_question_

 no _meta_end_question_

 well bad news for apple then _meta_end_dot_
