  homeland security secretary michael chertoff is taking heat from liberals and winning praise from conservatives for standing up to environmentalists who want to halt construction of the fence along the u s mexico border _meta_end_dot_

 in a wide ranging interview a handful of bloggers yesterday chertoff said his department was on target to build the congressionally mandated _meta_number_ref_ miles of fence by the end of the year _meta_number_ref_ pedestrian and _meta_number_ref_ vehicle _meta_end_dot_

 doing so would ensure that the next administration won t be able to derail the plan _meta_end_dot_

 this week chertoff announced he would bypass the national environmental policy act and _meta_number_ref_ other laws that could have delayed construction _meta_end_dot_

 environmentalists managed to bring construction to a crawl during a previous fence project it took _meta_number_ref_ years to build _meta_number_ref_ miles of fence near san diego _meta_end_dot_

 that s basically a mile a year chertoff said _meta_end_dot_

 at that rate if we were going to cover what we need to cover at the border it would be seven centuries _meta_end_dot_

 we do not have that long to wait chertoff s promise to complete the fence comes at a time when congress is considering a new round of immigration legislation _meta_end_dot_

 chertoff appeared unconvinced that anything substantive would pass this year but he indicated the ball would be in congress court _meta_end_dot_

 during yesterday s interview chertoff also spoke about implementing real id and dispelling myths about a national id card _meta_end_dot_

 earlier this week chertoff s department secured a promise from one final holdout maine to enact tougher licensing requirements in exchange for a waiver on real id compliance _meta_end_dot_
