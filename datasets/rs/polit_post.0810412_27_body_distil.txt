  expressing regret for not choosing his words well barack obama tries to clean up the mess he made of himself while standing by what he said in the first place hmm couple that with his attempt at contrition sounds like an imus style apology to me _meta_end_dot_

 where s the al sharpton s who speak for small town america _meta_end_question_

 i want some screaming and some insisting on people being fired _meta_end_exclamation_

 obama didn t say he was wrong or anything simple like that he said he was sorry if his rightness was poorly worded sufficiently to offend people _meta_end_dot_

 he didn t take it back either the man just doesn t get it and the democrats still don t get it either _meta_end_dot_
