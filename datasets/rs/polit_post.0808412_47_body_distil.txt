  as we swing into a new workweek the financial markets are on edge even with rumors afoot that jpmorgan chase will consider quintupling their offer to acquire the bear stearns companies to _meta_dollor_ref_ a share _meta_end_dot_

 among the key elements in the news background is a continuing sharp fall in commodities prices gold oil and industrial metals are all down again this morning _meta_end_dot_

 i told you about this here _meta_end_dot_

 and flying well under the news radar the last few days have seen some exceptional disruptions in the overnight interbank repo market that s the market in which banks get the money they need to make loans and honor withdrawals _meta_end_dot_

 one of the key rates is this market is the interest rate you would pay if you wanted to borrow money overnight using a three month treasury bill as collateral _meta_end_dot_

 this rate literally became negative late last week _meta_end_dot_

 what does that mean _meta_end_question_

 it means banks don t want to lend money to each other _meta_end_dot_

 you couldn t ask for a more textbook illustration of a credit crisis _meta_end_dot_

 what i wanted to talk about this morning however is the changing landscape for government policy as it relates to management of the financial system _meta_end_dot_

 there are at least two new major policy initiatives making the rounds in washington _meta_end_dot_

 in a word regulation is making a comeback _meta_end_dot_

 more _meta_end_dot_

 the fed in uncharted waters last week the federal reserve took a variety of actions they have rarely or never done before _meta_end_dot_

 variously described as creative and aggressive the fed s new posture acknowledges that the current market disorders are different in kind from anything seen in recent years _meta_end_dot_

 we all know about the role taken by the fed in facilitating the acquisition of bear stearns _meta_end_dot_

 this operation differed from what the fed did in _meta_number_ref_ during the long term crisis because they actually committed fed capital to assure the value of some of bear stearns s assets _meta_end_dot_

 they also extended the lender of last resort umbrella to wall street firms _meta_end_dot_

 intended to insure liquidity rather than solvency the fed s discount window lends short term funds at a relatively high interest rate to guarantee that commercial banks can meet their obligations to each other _meta_end_dot_

 this facility is now available to some investment banks and broker dealers as well _meta_end_dot_

 this acknowledges current reality which is that a shadow banking system has arisen largely outside the scope of traditional commercial banks and in which wall street firms are deeply enmeshed _meta_end_dot_

 the size of the interbank lending repo market has risen considerably more than the short term funding needs of commercial banks would suggest _meta_end_dot_

 and engineered financial products like collateralized debt obligations and structured investment vehicles have created a kind of credit that has largely escaped the reserve requirements and other regulations that banks must follow _meta_end_dot_

 a lot of that shadow credit found its way into the us mortgage lending market where it met up with some ridiculously lax underwriting standards _meta_end_dot_

 kaboom _meta_end_dot_

 but how is washington planning to respond to all this _meta_end_question_

 two key things re regulation first we re going to get a massive intervention and regulation of wall street and the private investment industry including hedge funds _meta_end_dot_

 this stands to reason _meta_end_dot_

 congress looks at the fed s activities in an oversimplified fashion and says to itself these guys are giving taxpayer dollars to a bunch of private companies _meta_end_dot_

 and we ll be damned if we let those private companies do whatever they want as a result _meta_end_dot_

 they re going to do what the taxpayers s representatives tell them to do the key people to watch on the hill are senator chris dodd and representative barney frank with cheerleading from senator chuck schumer _meta_end_dot_

 they re going to lead the way in proposing a variety of new taxes reserve and transparency requirements and a raft of new regulations _meta_end_dot_

 the administration with president bush and treasury secretary paulson in the lead are saying we re reluctant to intervene in free markets so what do they propose to do instead _meta_end_question_

 their answer will remind you of ralph kramden humm uh nuh humm uh nuh humm uh nuh in news reports and press conferences you re now starting to hear de regulation as a dirty word _meta_end_dot_

 it often comes right after the word republican which exposes the subtext pretty well _meta_end_dot_

 the current market disorders will be blamed on the de regulations undertaken from the reagan years onward and in particular the repeal of the glass steagall act which was completed in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 the prospective dodd frank schumer act frankly scares the heck out of me and for a very particular reason _meta_end_dot_

 that s because of the shadow banking system i mentioned above _meta_end_dot_

 no one really understands how it works _meta_end_dot_

 it s something new under the sun in terms of banking and the economists don t yet know how it impacts the real economy _meta_end_dot_

 blithely and confidently the re regulators will be shooting in the dark _meta_end_dot_

 the unintended consequences will be surprising to say the least _meta_end_dot_

 mortgage backed securities the second major thing is the idea that some agency of the federal government will step up to buy large amounts of mortgage backed securities mbs _meta_end_dot_

 expect to see proposals for a vehicle similar to the resolution trust corporation rtc which bailed out failed s ls in the late eighties and early nineties _meta_end_dot_

 the less likely alternative is a new agency modeled on one from the mid thirties that would actually go into the mortgage business and offer second mortgages directly to homeowners _meta_end_dot_

 the pr campaign by not disinterested private actors in favor of a massive government purchase of mbs is now in full swing _meta_end_dot_

 it is indeed possible and rather likely that a massive purchase of mbs will stabilize the housing market and unfreeze the credit crunch _meta_end_dot_

 it does of course represent a huge distortion of free markets _meta_end_dot_

 what you will hear and i am already hearing is hey conservatives get over this moral hazard hangup you have and join the real world we won t have the votes in congress nor are we likely to have compelling alternative ideas to stem this tide _meta_end_dot_

 i m extremely concerned about the price at which mbs will be purchased by the government because that s where all the potential mischief lies _meta_end_dot_

 there are two ways to bail out an asset class that is trading well below its long term stable value or as with mbs isn t really trading at all _meta_end_dot_

 you can buy them near their nominal face value _meta_end_dot_

 this would create a loss for taxpayers that could easily top _meta_dollor_ref_ trillion _meta_end_dot_

 or you can lowball the mbs holders and massively underpay _meta_end_dot_

 i prefer this approach because it would set a floor under the market rather than be the entire market thus freeing up private activity in the same securities _meta_end_dot_

 if handled shrewdly and correctly it also has the potential to produce a profit rather than a loss for the taxpayers _meta_end_dot_

 unfortunately the choice of approach will be made politically rather than by market dynamics _meta_end_dot_

 you can guess which way congress is likely to go _meta_end_dot_
