  so the big msm controversy today is over this comment by geraldine ferraro the obama folks are as expected up in arms over the comment and have demanded that hillary and ferraro do the pc perp walk before the world wide media and beg for their forgiveness _meta_end_dot_

 having a monster of your own making turn on you is always a tragedy isn t it _meta_end_question_

 anyway let s address the merits of ferraro s contention shall we _meta_end_question_

 would senator obama be where he is today were he not black _meta_end_question_

 please read on noting while ramesh is right in many respects i don t think it is fair to barack obama to suggest that he is in the position he is today primarily because of his race _meta_end_dot_

 in my view barack obama is beating hillary clinton because he knows who he is read authentic and is able to communicate his vision for the united states flawed as it is in a way that hillary could never dream of _meta_end_dot_

 i think it is also important to keep the following in mind _meta_number_ref_ at the beginning of the presidential campaign obama only had a slight lead over clinton with respect to the african american vote _meta_number_ref_ many prominent african american leaders have questioned obama s blackness whatever in the heck that is throughout this campaign _meta_number_ref_ the dream of an obama presidency began in lily white iowa _meta_number_ref_ the dramatic shift in african american support from clinton to obama from an almost statistical tie to _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_percent_ref_ in favor of obama is largely attributable to a post iowa belief among african americans that obama can actually win and disgust within that community over the clintons race baiting campaign tactics _meta_end_dot_

 so while i don t doubt that obama had some core african american support from the very get go this support in and of itself is not the reason why he is leading hillary clinton in the race to be the dem nominee _meta_end_dot_

 obama is beating hillary imho because he is an extremely talented politician who has tapped into the psyche of a large segment of the american public both black and white _meta_end_dot_

 and that has nothing to do with race and everything to do with extraordinary political ability _meta_end_dot_
