  i believe we should punitively tax oil companies and take from them as much as their profit as we possibly can diverting that profit into the general fund of the united states treasury _meta_end_dot_

 there i said it _meta_end_dot_

 i want the oil companies to have no profits none _meta_end_dot_

 nothing for their shareholders and nothing to reinvest in their companies _meta_end_dot_

 not one penny _meta_end_dot_

 this is a relatively simple thing for the feds to do and i m sure you ll agree with me once you understand why _meta_end_dot_

 first of all _meta_percent_ref_ of oil stocks are held by union pension funds _meta_end_dot_

 if we punitively tax big oil we will be screwing the unions _meta_end_dot_

 and heck they want to be screwed in that way _meta_end_dot_

 likewise given unionization in the oil industry and the need for layoffs if we start taxing their profits they ll be laying off union members likewise hurting unions through a decline in dues _meta_end_dot_

 second i believe there are few greater dangers in this country than the movement toward an earth first mentality where oil is bad keeping your lights on is bad and people are bad _meta_end_dot_

 few industries devote more of their profits to green technology and alternative fuel sources than ironically the oil companies all of whom recognize the need to adapt and become more earth friendly _meta_end_dot_

 as we advance down this road to earth friendliness we will see our taxes go up our costs go up and our standard of living go down all for the sake of putting the earth first _meta_end_dot_

 by and large we will have the oil companies to blame _meta_end_dot_

 due to their research on how to ween themselves from saudi arabia s teat we will actually be advancing the radical environmentalists agenda _meta_end_dot_

 the only way to stop this is to tax the profits of oil companies in a punitive way thereby providing them less money to invest in earth friendly technology _meta_end_dot_

 the sooner we start the better off we ll be in the long run _meta_end_dot_

 taking money away from the oil companies sticks it to both unions and environmentalists _meta_end_dot_

 i have no problem with that _meta_end_dot_

 let s do it _meta_end_dot_

 update dan mclaughlin i would add one further point to erick s analysis _meta_end_dot_

 if you take all oil profits out of private hands and reallocate them to the federal government congress will become literally addicted to selling oil thus eliminating the possibility of any future movement to restrict oil consumption in this country _meta_end_dot_

 once congress especially big spending congressional liberals has a vested interest in the oil business it won t want that business to dry up any more than the states want the tobacco business to go away _meta_end_dot_

 congress surrenders existing revenue streams about as easily as a barnacle abandons a boat remember the telephone tax instituted to pay for the spanish american war _meta_end_dot_

 someday down the road a future congress will need to decide whether it can pay for some big new spending program by drilling in anwr or whether it is willing to lose all those tasty extra tax dollars by imposing stricter cafe standards on suvs _meta_end_dot_

 guess what it will do _meta_end_question_
