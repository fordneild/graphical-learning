 update by ben unlike erick i do get univision _meta_end_dot_

 it really wasn t a particularly riveting debate ron paul got booed for being ron paul thompson had a couple good one liners mitt had to give a convoluted explanation about his hiring firing of the landscaping company but craig romney gave some pretty good spin about it in fluent espanol afterward to the reporters nothing really out of the ordinary _meta_end_dot_

 the undecided voter reviews from univision s viewers most of whom seemed to have been far better screened than cnn s including a few university of miami students and some veterans who actually seemed to be republicans gave high marks to giuliani and huckabee in particular and had pretty divided views about romney _meta_end_dot_

 that s about it _meta_end_dot_
