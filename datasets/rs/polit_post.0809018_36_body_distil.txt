 hayden had said in the short term as hayden pointed out and as woodward had continued in his article _meta_end_dot_

 on cnn s late edition james carville hillary surrogate kept repeating that she has not been nasty and besides the republicans will be worse in the general election _meta_end_dot_

 jamal simmons obama surrogate was rational throughout allowing even that obama could fall apart read on for the show by show review _meta_end_dot_

 let us deal first with iraq _meta_end_dot_

 two senators who have been in the ground in iraq a dozen times are republican senator lindsey graham and dem senator jack reed host chris wallace s guests on this morning s fox news sunday _meta_end_dot_

 wallace wanted to know what was happening with moqtada mookie al sadr vs _meta_end_dot_

 maliki and the iraqis _meta_end_dot_

 graham said that maliki was finally taking on the shi a militia in the south of iraq but he questioned how well maliki had planned his offensive we ll see if they did a good job planning this for his part reed declared that this new fighting was an example of the infighting between iraqi factions _meta_end_dot_

 he called it political posturing a grand attempt to appeal to the shi ite majority in iraq _meta_end_dot_

 he predicted that this sort of thing will continue and it will spin out of control graham pointed out that mookie is in the minority amongst shi a and the government has things under control in iraq _meta_end_dot_

 reed countered no we must get out and let the iraqis do whatever needs to be done _meta_end_dot_

 graham countered that this would lead to chaos that our armed forces are bringing stability to the region _meta_end_dot_

 we are he said fighting iranian based militias _meta_end_dot_

 reed said that we have to withdraw our forces _meta_end_dot_

 he basically said that he had no confidence that our military could withstand this test _meta_end_dot_

 graham countered that the surge is working _meta_end_dot_

 he called the fight in iraq an ideological struggle and he pointed out that iranians are killing americans in iraq bredesen on fns _meta_end_dot_

 next on fns tennessee s dem governor phil bredesen was on to discuss his plan for his party having the dem superdelegates meet in their own convention to fight this out before the dnc in denver _meta_end_dot_

 this is hurting us dems he lamented _meta_end_dot_

 the superdelegate convention could allow his party to move forward and concentrate on attacking john mccain _meta_end_dot_

 there s not just two candidates there s a party to think about host wallace asked him if hillary is forced to drop out would it backfire with women _meta_end_dot_

 a bigger question not asked was would it backfire with african americans if barry were forced from the race as hillary s desperate maneuvers if motivated by more than a will to power would consider this on the hillary question bredesen said that the process must be fair but it must not be the party bigwigs making the decision _meta_end_dot_

 he said it should be done before august so that the winner can say their mea culpa s it s my fault for being so nasty in winning this thing don t you know but politics is like this you buffoonish loser bredesen does not see al gore as a possibility _meta_end_dot_

 both candidates barry and hillary are great candidates _meta_end_dot_

 implied either would be better than gore _meta_end_dot_

 rendell and kerry on tw _meta_end_dot_

 pennsylvania governor ed rendell stumped for hillary opposite senator john kerry sitting in for barry on host george stephanopoulos s this week over on abc _meta_end_dot_

 kerry stipulated that hillary s run must end soon as it is giving time to bush mccain to attack _meta_end_dot_

 he complained that hillary keeps changing the bar for which delegates should be counted _meta_end_dot_

 kerry expressed confidence that in the coming weeks the dems would come to a consensus on this matter _meta_end_dot_

 ed as i call my governor declared that no one is worried about dem unity _meta_end_dot_

 he added that the people of pennsylvania want the delegates selected from florida and michigan to be counted _meta_end_dot_

 kerry complained that hillary doesn t want the party to be unified pointing out that she had complained about jeremiah wright to richard mellon scaife s newspaper the pittsburgh tribune review _meta_end_dot_

 kerry argued that obama showed the right judgment on iraq and afghanistan and that others had criticized barry s statements about unilateral strikes in pakistan but they were all wrong because ha _meta_end_exclamation_

 bush had just unilaterally attacked pakistan and killed a member of al qaeda s leadership _meta_end_dot_

 no praise for the president to kerry this was barry s idea on the matter of hillary joining the ticket kerry thinks obama can do whatever he wants to do _meta_end_dot_

 rendell boasted that okinawa jack murtha had supported his gal hillary _meta_end_dot_

 that s desperation on ed s part _meta_end_dot_

 joe lieberman on tw _meta_end_dot_

 next on tw independent senator joe lieberman noted the democratic party today is not the party it was in _meta_number_ref_ when he ran to be al gore s veep _meta_end_dot_

 the dems have been taken over by hyper partisans he said with an isolationist agenda _meta_end_dot_

 on the other hand he pushed john mccain as the heir to john f _meta_end_dot_

 kennedy _meta_end_dot_

 ask not and all that lieberman said that today s hyper partisanship is not good for the country and it s not good for my party his party indeed _meta_end_dot_

 he praised john mccain for his ability to reach across the aisle while he and mccain disagree on many things lieberman said they agree on the important things like putting the national interests ahead of partisanship _meta_end_dot_

 lieberman predicted a dem year in house and senate races but he is confident that voters will select the best candidate to be president _meta_end_dot_

 ergo he sees no mccain coattails so he can keep his chairmanship of homeland security and governmental affairs lieberman boasted that mccain agrees with him on such things as global warming and the _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ commission _meta_end_dot_

 john mccain he said is ready to move this country forward general hayden on mtp _meta_end_dot_

 tim russert s guest on nbc s meet the press was the cia director general michael hayden _meta_end_dot_

 he wore four stars on each shoulder _meta_end_dot_

 russert asked general hayden what was happening in iraq _meta_end_dot_

 the general replied that this was a decisive act by prime minister maliki to get personally involved in using what he has at his disposal to put parts of iraq under central government control which had not been under that control _meta_end_dot_

 it s a very decisive moment hayden said that the situation in iraq will be better when this mission is finished than it was before it began _meta_end_dot_

 russert complained that maliki had miscalculated the difficulty in rooting out the shi ite militiamen _meta_end_dot_

 hayden agreed that it is difficult but i pointed it out that maliki was doing it largely with the isf the iraqi security forces hayden pointed out that many people read dems have been complaining that the iraqis have not taken advantage of the space given them by the surge and this was an example of maliki doing just that _meta_end_dot_

 russert quoted from this bob woodward bit from the july _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ washington post russert asked hayden if woodward s assessment of what he said at the meeting was accurate _meta_end_dot_

 woodward accurate hayden diplomatically said that it was an incomplete assessment that he was talking about the ability to govern in the short term he used a sports metaphor dealing with a point in the pittsburgh marathon about mile _meta_number_ref_ where you knew if you made it that far the conditions made it a breeze after that _meta_end_dot_

 there were not natural breaks at that point in iraq hayden argued _meta_end_dot_

 to be fair to woodward which russert was not it was russert who was incomplete _meta_end_dot_

 woodward s article continued russert asked if maliki could have been successful in basra with u s _meta_end_dot_

 air support _meta_end_dot_

 hayden said we ll see russert asked if maliki s military crackdown in basra were a setback in the political process hayden said look tim this was something we all knew that we had to go through _meta_end_dot_

 this had to be resolved the second largest city in iraq could not remain beyond the control of the government looking to the past as he likes to do russert asked him if there was a colossal intelligence failure leading to the invasion of iraq _meta_end_dot_

 hayden acknowledged a mistake by the intelligence community saying that he was not with cia but was a part of that community and had voted yes on the report _meta_end_dot_

 russert asked why it had failed and hayden suggested that they had relied on carrying through old intelligence believing that what was true yesterday had to be true today because there was no reason for it to change _meta_end_dot_

 russert pointed to a washington post report which asserted that the u s _meta_end_dot_

 was stepping up unilateral attacks against al qaeda in afghanistan because it believes its buddy musharraf will lose lots of his power in the months ahead _meta_end_dot_

 hayden said that he could not confirm or deny that _meta_end_dot_

 he believes that osama bin laden is in those hinterlands and that any future terrorist attack will originate from there from the safe haven along the afghan pak border _meta_end_dot_

 they ll attempt these attacks he said with people who look western hayden believes obl s role in al qaeda is that of an iconic figure though he s not operationally involved in operations _meta_end_dot_

 russert accused the cia of torture and went into the debates _meta_end_dot_

 hayden denied it and he explained that the cia s operations and circumstances were completely different from those of the army limited by the army field manual _meta_end_dot_

 he pointed out that applying the army field manual against the cia was arbitrary if you want to limit what the cia does we ll live in whatever box you create just make the box for the circumstances which apply to the cia richardson on ftn _meta_end_dot_

 a bearded bill richardson speaking from some the city of some governor s convention said that hillary has a right to stay in the race but that they have to come together at the end of the june third day he objects to this intentional personal blood letting like demi and leeches richardson likes bredesen s idea he says but he doesn t want for the party big shots to choose the nominee _meta_end_dot_

 he wants party leaders like nancy al gore etc _meta_end_dot_

 to work something out for the superdelegates _meta_end_dot_

 schieffer asked him about carville s judas iscariot insult _meta_end_dot_

 if it had been nearer the _meta_number_ref_th of july rather than easter schieffer paraphrased he would have accused richardson of being benedict arnold richardson said that he won t stoop to the gutter with carville whom he barely knows _meta_end_dot_

 he said that he remains loyal to president bill clinton but that doesn t mean that he ll follow him around _meta_end_dot_

 he accused carville and others in the clinton campaign of spewing venom out of a sense of entitlement richardson has heard that the clintons were trying to enlist people to pressure him in a way that he felt to be inappropriate schieffer asked if richardson thinks barry has done enough to distance himself from jeremiah wright _meta_end_dot_

 is this going to hurt him richardson feels that barry confronted the issue directly and has distanced himself enough _meta_end_dot_

 think of this man obama as a symbol of america said richardson _meta_end_dot_

 mike nutter on ftn _meta_end_dot_

 next up with schieffer was philadelphia mayor mike nutter standing in for hillary _meta_end_dot_

 nutter thinks that it s up to the american people to determine if obama has put enough distance between himself and jeremiah wright _meta_end_dot_

 most americans reject that kind of hate filled rhetoric nutter would have left the church if his pastor had made such remarks _meta_end_dot_

 he talked about the problems in philadelphia and other cites _meta_end_dot_

 clinton has agreed to address them he said and barry has not _meta_end_dot_

 note ed rendell will throw money at philadelphia and nutter needn t even ask nutter talked about the veep choice being a very important one but he wants to stay focused on the election at hand not put the cart in front of the horse schieffer asked what a superdelegate should do _meta_end_dot_

 nutter said that as he understands it it is the role of the superdelegates to select who would be best for the party and best for the country _meta_end_dot_

 schieffer asked him what happens if obama is leading in every category going into the convention then the superdelegates overturn it _meta_end_dot_

 what will the african americans do _meta_end_question_

 nutter said that this about more than race _meta_end_dot_

 neither candidate can get enough delegates to win this thing without the superdelegates so let s let this thing play out carville and simmons on le _meta_end_dot_

 wolf led off talking to clinton surrogate james carville and obama partisan jamal simmons _meta_end_dot_

 carville said that barry wants to get some old white guys with white hair to get her hillary to get out of the race he said that obama should instead be concentrating on getting votes in pennsylvania and winning in north carolina _meta_end_dot_

 simmons asked for some level of civility though he refused to call it a blunder for pat leahy to ask hillary to quit _meta_end_dot_

 carville said that the dem campaign has not been negative _meta_end_dot_

 he said that he has said the most negative thing probably his labels for richardson _meta_end_dot_

 he said that it s going to get a lot worse than this against mccain _meta_end_dot_

 simmons recalled getting in fights with his brothers but pointed out that you didn t sucker punch your brother carville said that he didn t think hillary had done this simmons averted his gaze _meta_end_dot_

 carville said that the right wingers do not care what they use against dems _meta_end_dot_

 he pointed out that hillary s big donors don t like to be told that their candidate should withdraw from the race _meta_end_dot_

 carville said i think the best thing we can do is get this settled by june _meta_number_ref_nd he said that telling hillary to get out of the race is not working to get obama votes _meta_end_dot_

 carville said that this race is not particularly disruptive because it s nothing like what you re going to see in the general election simmons sees the party coalescing behind obama but he allowed that obama could fall apart carville called this a close race _meta_end_dot_

 he said that it hasn t been particularly negative and besides he repeated again the republicans will be even meaner _meta_end_dot_

 have at it _meta_end_dot_

 or should we leave that to the dems
