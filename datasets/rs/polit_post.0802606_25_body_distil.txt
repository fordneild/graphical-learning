  the title refers to ezra klein s sudden revelation that hey people are playing games with the democratic party s delegate count he s got the basic outline but is a little vague on how far it s gone _meta_end_dot_

 but that s why we re here to help well help and mock savagely _meta_end_dot_

 anyway via protein wisdom who essentially said well duh read on _meta_end_dot_

 first off sorry that this is going in friday night but the clinton campaign only dropped this sucker this afternoon _meta_end_dot_

 that would normally give the folks who froth the weekend to get ready for a nice big screamfest on monday watch this space except that monday s sotu day so probably nobody outside the sphere is really going to notice _meta_end_dot_

 clever alas _meta_end_dot_

 anyway as protein wisdom noted here and here and i already noted here this is hardly a surprise _meta_end_dot_

 michigan and florida are too important to ignore the dnc is not going to burn its bridges with two state parties that could make the difference between victory and defeat in november and the delegates are going to mostly belong to the establishment democratic candidate anyway _meta_end_dot_

 talkleft and josh marshall can squabble over who is to blame all they like but this isn t really a gambit this is the formal announcement preceding a fait accompli _meta_end_dot_

 now what makes all of this relevant is that the delegates will not officially count until the convention _meta_end_dot_

 that means that the media will not have to report those totals in their delegate counts if they don t want to _meta_end_dot_

 that means that if clinton doesn t have a clear majority without those delegates but does have a clear majority if she does _meta_end_dot_

 well _meta_end_dot_

 better hope that august in denver this year is unseasonably cold and cloudy or at least not particularly humid _meta_end_dot_

 no really _meta_end_dot_

 the city of denver s never done anything to me _meta_end_dot_

 personally that is _meta_end_dot_
