  hillary s chief strategist mark penn was recently fired for conducting lobbying business with the columbian government while working on her failed campaign _meta_end_dot_

 he wasn t really fired as he ll still be doing the same thing for the campaign without the title chris matthews s guy david shuster most known for calling the clintons daughter a whore had this to say on msnbc s morning show about that shuster misses the point in his pathetic attempt to defend hillary _meta_end_dot_

 it s not penn s fault that she failed to become her party s nominee _meta_end_dot_

 she is a lousy candidate _meta_end_dot_

 the only reason she was taken seriously is that she was bill clinton s wife and that s frankly not enough _meta_end_dot_

 there was nothing penn could have done _meta_end_dot_
