  barack obama today in south dakota suggests the united states does not have a good energy policy _meta_end_dot_

 he says they don t have an energy policy that would actually weaken iran and take money out of their pockets i assume by they he means the gop _meta_end_dot_

 he goes on to say we need to stop our dependence on foreign oil _meta_end_dot_

 well i would point out that barack obama voted in favor of the present energy policy when it was put to a vote on june _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ the very energy policy he does not now like _meta_end_dot_

 john mccain voted against that energy policy _meta_end_dot_

 i await barack obama s backpedaling on this _meta_end_dot_

 every time he stands on the little record he does have it s something he realizes he has to disown _meta_end_dot_

 it s like the democrats have nominated the love child of michael dukakis and john kerry and then declared george mcgovern his god father or is that gaia mother in the democrat party _meta_end_dot_
