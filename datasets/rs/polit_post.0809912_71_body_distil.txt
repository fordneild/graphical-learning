  something very interesting is going on in argentina and it relates to soybeans and beef _meta_end_dot_

 as you read through this try to count the number of parallels between their situation and ours _meta_end_dot_

 argentina is run by a political power couple nestor and cristina fernandez de kirchner _meta_end_dot_

 nestor became president in _meta_number_ref_ after a miserable economic collapse in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 he decided not to run for re election last year and blessed his wife s candidacy _meta_end_dot_

 she s president now _meta_end_dot_

 the kirchners have strong support among working class argentinians _meta_end_dot_

 their opponents are the well educated urban middle classes and the farmers who represent traditional oligarchic power in argentina _meta_end_dot_

 the dynamic duo have consolidated their power by systematically weakening argentina s congress _meta_end_dot_

 and they have engineered an economic boom and cemented their support among poorer argentinians through massive government spending _meta_end_dot_

 now argentina doesn t export petroleum as mexico and brazil do _meta_end_dot_

 they export agricultural commodities some of which are in extremely short global supply _meta_end_dot_

 that s where the story gets interesting _meta_end_dot_

 more _meta_end_dot_

 you ve probably heard about the global shortage of soybeans _meta_end_dot_

 europe and china import huge amounts of the stuff and cooking oil is a politically sensitive and price controlled staple food in china _meta_end_dot_

 for a handful of reasons bean prices are far higher than normal right now _meta_end_dot_

 that and continuing rainy weather in the upper midwest is why american farmers will be planting more acres to beans and fewer to corn this year well argentina has a huge amount of fertile land that has newly been planted to soybeans in the recent past _meta_end_dot_

 and soybean exports are cristina fernandez s piggybank _meta_end_dot_

 she needs one because all of the government spending she and hubby have done are resulting in some big time inflation _meta_end_dot_

 if you re unfamiliar with argentina s financial history in recent decades let s just say they re the poster child for international moral hazard _meta_end_dot_

 don t mention argentina to an international banker unless you want to get bit i m told that they can t raise interest rates to cure inflation because the country no longer has a functional banking system or private credit formation _meta_end_dot_

 so kirchner went looking for rich people to soak _meta_end_dot_

 early in march she increased export taxes on soybeans to an effective rate of nearly _meta_percent_ref_ of revenue including income taxes _meta_end_dot_

 since the cost of production is nearly _meta_percent_ref_ of revenue even at today s elevated world prices kirchner has turned soybeans into a marginal economic proposition for argentina s farmers _meta_end_dot_

 this woman is a strong tough savvy politician like someone else we know _meta_end_dot_

 but like that someone else we know you want to just smack her in the head for being such an ignoramus on economics _meta_end_dot_

 earth to cristina fernandez when the whole world wants to buy what your farmers grow you don t tax them out of business _meta_end_exclamation_

 you let them get fat and happy _meta_end_dot_

 in turn the foreign exchange they bring in will fatten up your economy and pull your fiscal buns out of the fire _meta_end_dot_

 but here s where politics trumps economics _meta_end_dot_

 sound familiar poorer argentinians think of farmers as the rich fatcats that always come out ahead by screwing the working stiff and deserve to be taken down a few notches _meta_end_dot_

 political measures that disadvantage farmers are broadly popular with the kirchners s electoral base _meta_end_dot_

 but what s happening now _meta_end_question_

 argentina s middle classes are coming out in support of the farmers with raucous street demonstrations in buenos aires and other cities _meta_end_dot_

 that makes sense because the farmers have been protesting their treatment by withholding ag products like beef from the cities _meta_end_dot_

 and how did kirchner respond _meta_end_question_

 by calling out the goons _meta_end_dot_

 she reportedly has violently suppressed some of the pro farmer demonstrations _meta_end_dot_

 pass the popcorn and let s be careful about electing populist power couples to high office here _meta_end_dot_
