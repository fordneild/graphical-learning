  it s not every day you see the presumptive nominee lose a presidential primary in a swing state by _meta_number_ref_ points by contrast despite a persistent protest vote faction mccain hasn t actually lost a primary since kansas and louisiana on february _meta_number_ref_ but that s exactly what happened to barack obama last night in west virginia and suggests pretty strongly why his campaign seems to be writing off the state for november _meta_end_dot_

 anyway let s update the chart i ve been running last installment here showing the popular vote trend since obama s armor started to crack at the beginning of march _meta_end_dot_

 here s the current chart read on there s much more _meta_end_dot_

 attentive readers will note that some of the earlier states vote totals have changed slightly i m using the rcp figures which presumably got some late corrections on tx pa in and nc _meta_end_dot_

 rcp also has the overall numbers which mostly narrowly favor obama though it depends on what states you count in any event recall that obama didn t even crack _meta_percent_ref_ in national polls against hillary until after he won iowa and didn t catch her until early february after trailing by double digits for most of _meta_number_ref_ much of the obama vote in the first two months was basically the honeymoon of a challenger who had yet to be seriously vetted _meta_end_dot_

 so while looking at the last two and a half months doesn t cover the whole race it likely tells us a lot more than looking at things that happened a political lifetime ago _meta_end_dot_

 if you knew nothing else of this race you d certainly look at those trendlines and think especially after last night that hillary was really pulling away by now _meta_end_dot_

 where from here _meta_end_question_

 another interesting thing is that my rough estimate projection last week vastly underestimated hillary s west virginia margin of victory which was twice what my mostly unscientific model had projected _meta_end_dot_

 partly that s because i was working off one poll with a lot of undecideds but partly it s because turnout was larger than the baseline i was using the number of votes for house democrats in the off year _meta_number_ref_ election which i took as a reasonable proxy for the number of people available to vote in a democratic primary _meta_end_dot_

 i ll attach at the bottom of this post a chart showing how that figure has served as a predictor of turnout but the take home from that exercise is that west virginia democrats came out in very large numbers despite their betters in the media telling them the race was over already man not quite as large numbers as we saw in indiana north carolina mississippi and texas but larger proportional turnout by this metric than in pennsylvania ohio wisconsin or virginia _meta_end_dot_

 the voters apparently think there s still something to vote on _meta_end_dot_

 if we update last week s projections then with more recent polling and an assumption of _meta_percent_ref_ rather than _meta_percent_ref_ turnout relative to the _meta_number_ref_ figures what do we get _meta_end_question_

 i m using now the rcp averages for oregon and kentucky but i don t have new polls for puerto rico south dakota or montana and i m still using the conservative _meta_percent_ref_ estimate for puerto rico in other words if form holds even using the conservative projection of the vote total in puerto rico obama could end up well over half a million votes under water for the last three months of the primaries _meta_end_dot_

 we can only speculate as to why obama has been struggling like this whether it s a sign of hillary s strength the nature of the later primary states a temporary weakness or permanent damage to obama and whether it will carry over in the general election campaign _meta_end_dot_

 but i can say this if obama was a fatally damaged general election candidate by this point this is pretty much how you would expect him to be doing in the late primaries _meta_end_dot_

 here s the turnout chart which is interesting in its own right the primary vote total is just obama s and clinton s votes so it may underreport turnout in a few of the early races when some people were still casting votes for edwards in michigan where obama didn t bother getting on the ballot i just added hillary plus the uncommitted vote _meta_end_dot_

 the states marked na are caucus states that have not released vote totals the states with turnout below _meta_percent_ref_ are mostly caucuses as well most of which obama won _meta_end_dot_

 we can only speculate whether primaries in those states would have produced _meta_number_ref_ more votes for obama or _meta_number_ref_ a different outcome _meta_end_dot_

 at any rate you can see that turnout by this metric had largely hovered around _meta_percent_ref_ until the more recent primaries that saw a surge of interest another reason why the march april may results should be more worrisome to obama backers as despite his claims at bringing in new voters he actually tends to do worse the larger the turnout _meta_end_dot_
