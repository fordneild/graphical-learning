 if you re active at all on the internet you ve likely received an email or seen an ad or some other type of tease directing you to get involved with the game international aid program called free rice _meta_end_dot_

 free rice is said to be the brainchild of john breen a _meta_number_ref_ something computer programmer and is already wildly successful _meta_end_dot_

 at the website visitors play an english vocabulary game _meta_end_dot_

 getting the right answer means _meta_number_ref_ grains of rice are donated to starving nations as food aid _meta_end_dot_

 how successful is it _meta_end_question_

 on the site s very first day october _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ just _meta_number_ref_ grains of rice were donated _meta_end_dot_

 six weeks later on november _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ according to the site a staggering _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ grains were donated _meta_end_dot_

 such is the power of the web bloggers email and the other viral methods of marketing used to promote the idea _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 unfortunately as delightful as this sounds the reality is that all this effort will likely amount to little more than giving players a false impression they ve done something effective to combat world hunger _meta_end_dot_

 for the people supposed to benefit from all this largesse little will actually change and things will likely get worse _meta_end_dot_

 free rice is simply the latest in a decades old collection of failed programs designed to help the starving _meta_end_dot_

 little effort is needed to determine that this program like so many of those before it involves the united nations _meta_end_dot_

 free rice s sister site is poverty com _meta_end_dot_

 poverty com displays a list of _meta_number_ref_ countries which agreed to contribute a percentage of their gross national income to international aid _meta_end_dot_

 this would raise _meta_dollor_ref_ billion per year _meta_end_dot_

 from the website you get the impression this was a recent pledge _meta_end_dot_

 it talks about conferences and summits from _meta_number_ref_ to _meta_number_ref_ where the world s nations via the un pledge this aid to combat world hunger _meta_end_dot_

 in reality that pledge was first made in the un in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 since then un member nations have donated trillions of dollars and yet world hunger is the same or worse as when this program was initially agreed upon _meta_end_dot_

 the problem involves the same nations and parts of the world _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ years of effort and no success to report _meta_end_dot_

 the un has been an abysmal failure at almost everything it has undertaken _meta_end_dot_

 international aggression in the middle east _meta_end_question_

 humanitarian crises like tsunamis _meta_end_question_

 purely un based programs like the oil for food program scandal in iraq _meta_end_question_

 take your pick _meta_end_dot_

 the un is corrupt ineffective bloated and inefficient _meta_end_dot_

 why should we get involved with another un boondoggle _meta_end_question_

 free rice offers a way for people to feel good while actually doing nothing of substance to fix the problem _meta_end_dot_

 individuals aren t even asked to contribute a single penny of their own money _meta_end_dot_

 free rice displays advertising from corporations and so it is ad dollars that pay for this _meta_end_dot_

 the un gets its cut of course _meta_end_dot_

 administrative oversight and other international low speed high drag twaddle _meta_end_dot_

 but there s a more important reason to dislike the program _meta_end_dot_

 bottom line _meta_end_question_

 not only is its administration problematic it makes the problem worse _meta_end_exclamation_

 as far back as _meta_number_ref_ the heritage foundation documents objections to programs like this _meta_end_dot_

 beyond the corruption the diversion of food to other groups and areas and the myriad other obstacles programs like free rice must overcome the problem is their goal is to end hunger _meta_end_dot_

 however except in cases of disasters like earthquakes and tsunamis hunger is merely a symptom of the real problem poverty _meta_end_dot_

 flooding the markets of starving countries with free food prevents those markets and agriculture infrastructure from making money and developing adequate and modern infrastructure to ensure they ll be able to fed themselves in the future _meta_end_dot_

 when the infrastructure either fails to develop or erodes further it guarantees there will be both poverty and hunger to spare next year _meta_end_dot_

 better we take the money from our companies and governments and build real roads and pipelines for irrigation and rail and air hubs for shipment and exchanges for fair market trades _meta_end_dot_

 these practical and proven infrastructure improvements would do more to feed the hungry than all the grains of rice we can donate by knowing what dystopia means _meta_end_dot_

 of course that would mean implementing democracy capitalism and the rest of the nasty detestable characteristics of the us and other first world nations _meta_end_dot_

 i doubt that will go over big with either the despots and dictators ruling these countries or their compatriots at the un who talk a nice talk in the arena of assistance but fail to walk any walk at all when it comes to practically changing the reality on the ground _meta_end_dot_

 so if you want to improve your vocabulary spend some of your own money on a thesaurus _meta_end_dot_

 if you really want to help starving people you ve a better chance at doing that by sending a check directly to haliburton than by taking part in any program involving the un _meta_end_dot_

 should we help set these suffering people free _meta_end_question_

 absolutely _meta_end_dot_

 but free rice isn t the way to get the job done _meta_end_dot_

 thinking the truth of the premise that there s no such thing as a free lunch wins another round _meta_end_dot_
