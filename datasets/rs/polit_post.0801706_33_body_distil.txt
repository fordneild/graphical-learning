  a habit has crept into comments when referring to the current junior senator from illinois _meta_end_dot_

 in what is apparently an effort to annoy and distress our colleagues on the other side certain individuals make it a point to refer to said senator by turning his first name into an initial and spelling out his middle name _meta_end_dot_

 i would appreciate it if this habit stopped from now on it s kind of low rent if you know what i mean _meta_end_dot_

 so please when referring to him in the future use his proper name _meta_end_dot_

 the one he s earned senator barack reagan lover obama _meta_end_dot_

 thank you for your attention in this matter _meta_end_dot_

 moe lane ps open thread _meta_end_dot_
