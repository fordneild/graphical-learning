  within the first weeks after receiving enough delegates to secure the nomination barack obama should go to iraq and meet with general petraeus without preconditions _meta_end_dot_

 there would be a lot of preparation _meta_end_dot_

 the first steps would not be to pre judge all the items on the list _meta_end_dot_

 more below the fold _meta_end_dot_

 obama hasn t been to iraq since january _meta_number_ref_ before the golden mosque bombing by al qaeda _meta_end_dot_

 a lot has happened since then _meta_end_dot_

 last monday john mccain invited obama to join him on his upcoming visit to iraq _meta_end_dot_

 the obama campaign flatly rejected the offer _meta_end_dot_

 bill burton campaign spokesman i m pretty sure mccain won t pull out a mission accomplished banner on a joint trip and i m also pretty sure that obama could exclude any walks with mccain through baghdad markets _meta_end_dot_

 ed morrissey after all iraq is in the top two of top two issues in this country _meta_end_dot_

 it seems reasonable to me that obama should go there and see for himself what s taking place and get his information directly from the source or sources _meta_end_dot_

 in addition to mosul and basra perhaps he could even go to diyala province now that it s been pacified _meta_end_dot_

 anyway it s heartening to hear that obama is at least considering going there again ed morrissey it would also be interesting to see if obama does change his _meta_number_ref_ month cut and run policy after a visit to iraq considering that there are strong indicators that the strategy is working _meta_end_dot_

 i m doubtful that he will _meta_end_dot_

 why _meta_end_question_

 because his plan is too diametrically opposed to the current strategy and in my view he s too politically invested to change it because such a change would anger and inflame the very base that propelled him to the nomination _meta_end_dot_

 there would be hell to pay from the hard partisan left _meta_end_dot_

 obama s withdrawal proposal is a direct and complete rejection of the counterinsurgency strategy crafted by general petraeus and his opposition to the strategy has been longstanding _meta_end_dot_

 here s what obama said on january _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ the coin strategy envisions a political accommodation and a military approach _meta_end_dot_

 obama rejected this favoring the former but not the latter _meta_end_dot_

 on february _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ the house approved the following resolution congress disapproves of the decision of president george w _meta_end_dot_

 bush announced on january _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ to deploy more than _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ additional united states combat troops to iraq it passed _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ but the senate version failed to clear cloture _meta_end_dot_

 obama voted in favor of putting the resolution to a vote _meta_end_dot_

 twelve months later obama s rejection of the present strategy remains in full force and effect _meta_end_dot_

 after foreign policy advisor samantha power said that obama s proposal to withdraw all combat brigades in _meta_number_ref_ months was a best case scenario the obama campaign disowned her michael dobbs didn t mention that the obama campaign also disowned power because she called hillary clinton a monster on british television _meta_end_dot_

 nevertheless the campaign directly repudiated both her best case scenario remarks and the hillary is a monster comment _meta_end_dot_

 the reality may be that obama will sign on to the petraeus strategy if elected but i don t see any indications of it right now _meta_end_dot_

 so as it stands by dint of his plan he must believe that our endeavor in iraq is irretrievably lost so the only rationale alternative is to remove our troops with haste _meta_end_dot_

 because of the numbers the logistics the bases and whatnot _meta_number_ref_ months is pretty hasty and to me it s likely that such a rapid departure would conflict with the latest january _meta_number_ref_ nie on iraq _meta_end_dot_

 changing gears a little last april i wrote a post on ambassador crocker s testimony before the senate foreign relations committee _meta_end_dot_

 political progress has been made but surely not as quickly as anyone likes _meta_end_dot_

 the main sunni bloc s recent suspension of talks on national reconciliation is an example of the volatility and fragility of the process _meta_end_dot_

 but it is a process _meta_end_dot_

 the national government has shown some willingness to incorporate sunnis into the military forces but only haltingly _meta_end_dot_

 al maliki is stronger politically but he needs to do more _meta_end_dot_

 here s another indicator that the coin strategy is working _meta_end_dot_

 news coverage is way down it s not bleeding so it s not leading _meta_end_dot_
