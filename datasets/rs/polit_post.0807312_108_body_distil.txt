  i hope i didn t scare you too much with my recent stories here and here about spreading contagion among holders of mortgage backed securities mbs _meta_end_dot_

 keep some fear in reserve because the news is getting worse _meta_end_dot_

 carlyle capital corporation ccc an entity formed by the famed carlyle group of washington dc is in default on a portfolio of about _meta_dollor_ref_ billion worth of mbs and will probably be liquidated by its creditors _meta_end_dot_

 this is a big ripple in a big pond _meta_end_dot_

 more _meta_end_dot_

 as linked above i wrote about the fire sale of about _meta_dollor_ref_ billion in alt a mbs by the union bank of switzerland last week and the effect that the sale would have on other holders of similar securities _meta_end_dot_

 the transaction essentially marked down the market not in a literal sense but by increasing the risk aversion of the bankers who lend money to people that have purchased mbs _meta_end_dot_

 that includes carlyle capital which was formed last july and sold _meta_dollor_ref_ million of equity to the public which is now all but wiped out _meta_end_dot_

 a statement which appeared this morning on carlyle group s website stresses that carlyle capital and carlyle group are separate legal and business entities and that the distress in ccc will not materially affect investors in carlyle group the people who lent carlyle capital the money to buy their mbs have now decided that they want more collateral to match the newly increased perceived risk of the portfolio _meta_end_dot_

 ccc has had _meta_dollor_ref_ million in margin calls since last week and expects to get another _meta_dollor_ref_ million call today _meta_end_dot_

 this is money that carlyle might have to been able to bridge from someone in normal times _meta_end_dot_

 under the circumstances no one is going to help them out and their creditors will probably seize their mbs assets _meta_end_dot_

 what will they do with them _meta_end_question_

 take a guess _meta_end_dot_

 if you re not familiar with how an unmet margin call works think of it as roughly comparable to a mortgage foreclosure _meta_end_dot_

 just as a foreclosing bank will try to get whatever they can for your house at auction the same will probably happen here _meta_end_dot_

 and that has everyone in the financial world biting the buttons of their cushy leather chairs with their anal orifices _meta_end_dot_

 what if there is a fire sale of carlyle s assets comparable to the one ubs did last week _meta_end_question_

 and what if it s even worse than the one ubs did _meta_end_question_

 after all the ubs asset sale was voluntary not forced _meta_end_dot_

 a lot of dominoes may start falling _meta_end_dot_

 is there an appropriate policy response to this _meta_end_question_

 i wish you hadn t asked _meta_end_dot_

 the free market approach is to let the chips fall where they may _meta_end_dot_

 we will probably end up with a massive de leveraging of the financial system and a long slow period of balance sheet rebuilding _meta_end_dot_

 ultimately we ll get a stronger system out of it _meta_end_dot_

 but the great depression wasn t any fun and great depression ii won t be any fun either _meta_end_dot_

 the aggressive policy response is even worse _meta_end_dot_

 the taxpayers could end up owning several trillion dollars worth of home mortgages _meta_end_dot_

 how are you going to fund that _meta_end_question_

 and more importantly what would the price be _meta_end_question_
