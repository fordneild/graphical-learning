  if we actually had a competent mainstream media it would take note of this post and the refutations of conventional protectionist pabulum it contains _meta_end_dot_

 then said competent mainstream media would report and discuss said refutations at length thus helping facts triumph over scaremongering and creating a valid and dare we say it reality based coalition in favor of free trade _meta_end_dot_

 then protectionists would find themselves and their movement in full retreat _meta_end_dot_

 then free traders would be able to enact policies that would help engender prosperity across the board _meta_end_dot_

 will this spasm of good sense on the part of the mainstream media actually take place _meta_end_question_

 i doubt it _meta_end_dot_

 but a blogger can dream can t he _meta_end_question_

 and as long as i am dreaming would someone be kind enough to take note of this and report it _meta_end_question_

 it is nice and good that austan goolsbee is reality based _meta_end_dot_

 too bad that his candidate does not appear to be as well _meta_end_dot_
