  it would appear that ohio democratic officials have better things to do with their time than indulge alternet in its happy little revenge fantasy remember ye progressives democrat davis chappell is the reason why rush limbaugh isn t going to get indicted _meta_end_dot_

 well not really but that s how you ll remember it once you ve told the story to yourselves ten or twelve times _meta_end_dot_

 read on _meta_end_dot_

 i m not sure whether this little exercise rush limbaugh calls it operation chaos i m also unsure whether it s supposed to evoke the notorious cia operation of the same name is more effective as an actual voting technique or as a burr under the saddle of the democratic party _meta_end_dot_

 as it stands right now there s really no way to tell whether or not it s actually working _meta_end_dot_

 but if democrats think that it s working or even just can t rule it out they re going to be off half a step _meta_end_dot_

 given that they re already off two or three thanks to this wonderfully baroque_meta_beep_ref_ primary that they ve saddled themselves with the results are truly marvelous to behold _meta_end_dot_

 for that matter even if their primary resolves itself tomorrow they ve already self sabotaged the premise that the primary voter disparity is actually meaningful _meta_end_dot_

 it s kind of hard to make the argument that the primaries show the inevitable swell of support for the democratic candidate while at the same time screaming about how every republican in the world crossed over to interfere with their primary process _meta_end_dot_

 oh sure they ll still try _meta_end_dot_

 then again they try all sorts of things _meta_end_dot_

 moe ps all of this is apparently now gearing up to happen in oregon _meta_end_dot_

 best to jump on that eh _meta_end_question_

 i particularly recommend calling every oregonian democratic official to make sure that they re all on top of this _meta_end_dot_

 every day _meta_end_dot_

 during dinnertime that way you know that they re at home _meta_end_dot_

 pps my name isn t davis chappell _meta_end_dot_

 go complain to him about how rush really and truly did commit voter fraud i m not being paid to care _meta_end_dot_

 shoot i m not being paid period _meta_end_dot_

 i am fairly certain that he didn t mean to evoke the poul anderson novel of the same name which is a shame it s quite good _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_beep_ref_ not rube golberg his mechanisms worked after all _meta_end_dot_
