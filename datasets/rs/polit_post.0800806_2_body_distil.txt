  i realize the left doesn t really have a sense of humor but you have to hand it to them _meta_end_dot_

 some genius lefty has been trying to encourage people to go through paypal and give us just a penny because paypal charges _meta_number_ref_ cents on contributions _meta_end_dot_

 the net result is that we don t get the penny and the lefty loses a penny _meta_end_dot_

 it s not like paypal charges us more than a penny on a penny donation _meta_end_dot_

 but we do get their name credit card billing address and email address _meta_end_dot_

 those are actually valuable pieces of information _meta_end_dot_
