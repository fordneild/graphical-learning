  romney mike you agreed that net net you raised taxes by half a billion dollars _meta_end_dot_

 is that right _meta_end_question_

 huckabee sure mitt _meta_end_dot_

 i ll answer your question _meta_end_dot_

 during my ten plus years as governor of a swing state i did net net raise taxes in that amount _meta_end_dot_

 for some crazy reason i thought it might be a good idea to have drivable roads and an educated citizenry _meta_end_dot_

 and unlike you i actually stood for and won reelection on my record _meta_end_dot_

 looks directly in the camera you see folks sometimes government has to make short term investments in infrastructure and education for the long term benefit of its citizens _meta_end_dot_

 and as governor of arkansas i had to make some tough choices _meta_end_dot_

 i stand by those choices and my record _meta_end_dot_

 looks back at romney so mitt feel free to keep crunching those numbers and throwing them around entirely out of context _meta_end_dot_

 i am much more concerned with actually addressing the needs of every day americans _meta_end_dot_
