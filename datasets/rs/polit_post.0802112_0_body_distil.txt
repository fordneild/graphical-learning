  hillary clinton and john mccain got what are perceived to be the big prizes yesterday with clinton s win in nevada and mccain s in south carolina _meta_end_dot_

 but despite clinton s win in nevada it is worth noting that obama got the most delegates in the state _meta_end_dot_

 as for the actual votes at the caucus it is worth noting the fact that the obama people are crying foul read on _meta_end_dot_

 former president clinton claims to have witnessed voter suppression _meta_end_dot_

 but as the politico story indicates his claims may not exactly be filled to the rim with validity _meta_end_dot_

 moreover the former president s activities appear to be alienating democrats once famed for being close to him _meta_end_dot_

 meanwhile this report daily kos link for those who want advanced warning this report and this one as well all allege a whole lot of dirty tricks on the part of the clinton campaign _meta_end_dot_

 that last link is worth special mention it ought to be interesting to see whether or not anything is made of the fact that barack hussein obama is the target of the clintons ire _meta_end_dot_

 and why precisely is his middle name used _meta_end_question_

 who knows _meta_end_question_

 mccain has clearly gotten momentum from his win in south carolina and competes with romney for frontrunner status _meta_end_dot_

 romney s win in nevada is helpful but diminished since no one else really competed in the state _meta_end_dot_

 fred thompson my candidate finished a disappointing third _meta_end_dot_

 i hate to think that this is the end for him but from all indications it appears to be _meta_end_dot_

 i reject the contention that thompson ran a lazy campaign though his campaign structure may have been a disorganized one _meta_end_dot_

 the main problem is that thompson appeared to be more ambitious for his ideas than he was for his person and made that clear consistently by stating that he wasn t in the race because it was fun or because he was consumed by personal ambition _meta_end_dot_

 unfortunately modern politics demands personal ambition in addition to an ambition for ideas and the voters saw thompson s old time southern gentlemanliness as reticence for the job _meta_end_dot_

 his campaign appears to have suffered accordingly _meta_end_dot_
