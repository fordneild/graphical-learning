  like many people i d let myself hope that last august s global financial crisis was just that a phenomenon arising from and largely contained within the narrow world of finance and capital markets _meta_end_dot_

 much like the _meta_number_ref_ long term capital management crisis or the _meta_number_ref_ stock market crash _meta_end_dot_

 how wrong i was _meta_end_dot_

 the last two weeks have seen growing evidence that disorders in financial markets are having serious spillover effects in real economies around the world _meta_end_dot_

 everyone is talking about the extreme weakness of the us dollar which has lost ground against every one of the world s major trading currencies and continues to slide _meta_end_dot_

 the proximate causes of the weaker dollar are poor economic fundamentals in the us and the federal reserve s interest rate cuts _meta_end_dot_

 dollar weakness is evidently resulting in a very large and worrisome burst of inflation _meta_end_dot_

 in nearly every major economy except the united states _meta_end_dot_

 we re exporting inflation to the rest of world and not suffering much or any of it ourselves _meta_end_dot_

 this is really weird _meta_end_dot_

 more _meta_end_dot_

 every day brings headlines about the contortions central bankers are putting themselves to in an attempt to stem the inflationary effects of the weaker dollar _meta_end_dot_

 some key examples china is about to raise interest rates and bank reserve requirements for the seventh time this year by my count _meta_end_dot_

 food price inflation particularly for vegetables and pork are contributing to an expected rise in inflation this year to almost _meta_percent_ref_ from about _meta_number_ref_ _meta_percent_ref_ last year _meta_end_dot_

 chinese stock markets which are off limits to foreign investors are in the middle of a price bubble that makes the clinton era internet bubble look like a little fart _meta_end_dot_

 that s logical when the inflation rate is higher than the government controlled rate of interest on individual savings _meta_end_dot_

 the china bubble is going to pop in fact it may have started to pop already and it s anybody s guess what will happen in this unprecedented situation _meta_end_dot_

 not only has there never been an asset bubble that featured several companies worth nearly _meta_dollor_ref_ trillion each but it s also never happened in a tightly controlled economy with no free markets to pick up the pieces _meta_end_dot_

 india has flirted with controls on currency movements for most of this year _meta_end_dot_

 they just pulled the trigger on some new restrictions on derivatives trading that are designed to restrict dollar sales by investors and speculators _meta_end_dot_

 the dynamics are somewhat different but as in china india is seeing asset price spikes that are not justified by fundamentals _meta_end_dot_

 this can only end badly for india which attracts only a fraction of the foreign direct investment that china does _meta_end_dot_

 states across the arab world are feeling the bite from higher oil prices _meta_end_dot_

 oil is traded in dollars around the world and the weaker dollar puts up the barrel price _meta_end_dot_

 there is talk of revaluing dollar pegged currencies across the persian gulf as the pseudo economies of these states can t handle the inflation _meta_end_dot_

 south korea is seeing serious declines in the results of major exporting companies like hyundai heavy industries and they re blaming the strong won _meta_end_dot_

 japan is seeing that effect with companies like honda and sony _meta_end_dot_

 toyota motor s problems appear to be more self inflicted _meta_end_dot_

 and the japanese are also getting an ugly spike in food and consumer goods prices just as they appear to be slowing into recession _meta_end_dot_

 pound sand and europe has started talking trade war _meta_end_dot_

 the strong euro leaves them no flexibility to raise interest rates which they have wanted to do to curb high inflation particularly in germany _meta_end_dot_

 and now their economies have started to slow down as well _meta_end_dot_

 hence the sudden tough talk by french president sarkozy and european central bank governor jean claude trichet _meta_end_dot_

 but here in the united states inflation has been muted _meta_end_dot_

 there s been a minor but politically noticeable uptick in food prices that has farmers tickled pink for the first time in a decade and consumers starting to grumble _meta_end_dot_

 and of course energy prices have faintly shadowed the increase in crude prices _meta_end_dot_

 i think you can make a case that the domestic food price increases are partly caused by government mandated production of ethanol from corn _meta_end_dot_

 and our trade deficit has unexpectedly narrowed in recent weeks as american exporters are suddenly finding their products newly competitive in world markets _meta_end_dot_

 that s the main reason why the europeans are mad as wet hens _meta_end_dot_

 they want the us treasury to go out and take concrete steps to increase the value of the dollar _meta_end_dot_

 it s also why treasury secretary paulson s mouth is saying a strong dollar is in our nation s interest but his in actions are telling the rest of the world to go pound sand _meta_end_dot_

 policy tools what does a central bank traditionally do when it considers foreign exchange rates to be out of balance _meta_end_question_

 it intervenes in the currency markets buying and selling reserves in order to signal desired price moves to the markets _meta_end_dot_

 but the markets know that trick now _meta_end_dot_

 they also know that they are larger than all the central banks put together _meta_end_dot_

 in fact they are vastly larger _meta_end_dot_

 a jumbo sized multi country intervention might involve the purchase of a few tens of billions of dollars _meta_end_dot_

 but nowadays the currency markets can easily trade _meta_dollor_ref_ trillion in a single day _meta_end_dot_

 that s why even as they try to jawbone hank paulson to support the dollar with more than happy talk none of the other central banks are willing to throw their own euros yen won reals sterling kronor loonies swiss francs etc _meta_end_dot_

 into a gaping black hole _meta_end_dot_

 traditional policy tools aren t working _meta_end_dot_

 exporting inflation but why on earth is it that the rest of the world is suffering from the inflation that we re creating _meta_end_question_

 i think this exceptional phenomenon illustrates some perhaps under appreciated features of the new integrated global economy _meta_end_dot_

 in the first place the united states still matters as much as ever _meta_end_dot_

 it s received wisdom that emerging economies around the world are growing faster and attracting more investment than the us and also that china is rapidly transitioning to a consumer led economy that will replace the us as a source of demand for goods and services _meta_end_dot_

 given that it s been nothing short of breathtaking to see how quickly the perception of economic weakness in the us has translated into slowdowns everywhere else _meta_end_dot_

 this exacerbates the effects of dollar inflation in economies that don t generate enough organic growth to deal with it _meta_end_dot_

 the us is still the critical driver for world growth _meta_end_dot_

 second the us is less dependent on imports than many people seem to think including economically illiterate democratic senators and presidential candidates _meta_end_dot_

 foreign trade amounts to perhaps _meta_percent_ref_ of our economy _meta_end_dot_

 this is probably insulating us from the inflationary effects of importing foreign goods with weaker dollars _meta_end_dot_

 third our economy may be more resistant to the effects of higher energy prices than many people think _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_percent_ref_ of the us economy is engaged in providing services rather than manufacturing goods or exporting resources _meta_end_dot_

 we have much more opportunity to capture the efficiencies created by improved information technology than other countries do _meta_end_dot_

 just think of the fuel savings if everyone were to work at home one day a week _meta_end_dot_

 things like that are already happening _meta_end_dot_

 that partly explains why countries like japan which is still almost as manufacturing driven as anyone else are seeing so much inflation _meta_end_dot_

 making and transporting widgets is energy intensive _meta_end_dot_

 higher oil prices make everything from rice to rice paper more expensive but they don t have as much impact on your computer or your telephone _meta_end_dot_

 bottom line at this point in mid november i expect continued severe disturbances in financial markets around the world _meta_end_dot_

 just about the only things many people want to buy right now are short term government debt and commodities priced in dollars _meta_end_dot_

 there s a lot of bears roaring out there and they may be roaring for a good long time to come _meta_end_dot_

 i also expect china to finally wake up smell whatever they drink in the morning and allow the yuan to appreciate sharply and rapidly against the dollar _meta_end_dot_

 but the united states has a chance to emerge in a considerably stronger position in a somewhat smaller and slower growing global economy when we get to the other side of this big mishugas two or three years from now _meta_end_dot_

 what do we have to do make sure that happens _meta_end_question_

 nothing _meta_end_dot_

 american businesspeople will figure it out and make all the right moves naturally _meta_end_dot_

 but we have to make d mned sure that no democrat gets within spitting distance of the white house _meta_end_dot_

 otherwise she ll turn a fragile but promising situation into our competitors wettest dream _meta_end_dot_
