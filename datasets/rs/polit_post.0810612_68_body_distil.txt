  this is a story about how difficult it is to measure economic output in ways that are actually useful both from a policy perspective and for understanding the real economy _meta_end_dot_

 in raw numbers the us economy has been growing consistently since the _meta_number_ref_ recession but it doesn t seem that way if you look at evidence like the stock market s performance and the decline in consumer balance sheets _meta_end_dot_

 and if you look at the political mood of the country as expressed in opinion polling forget about it _meta_end_dot_

 so why does economic growth feel so much like malaise _meta_end_question_

 part of the answer may lie in the mix of things we choose to produce _meta_end_dot_

 specifically healthcare _meta_end_dot_

 more apart from government itself healthcare is perhaps the largest industry in the economy that does not benefit from free markets _meta_end_dot_

 the energy business may come close but i think healthcare overall is bigger _meta_end_dot_

 agricultural production is also not a free market industry but its size relative to the whole economy is minuscule and healthcare spending is largely driven by legal entitlements which are subject to neither political nor economic discipline _meta_end_dot_

 and the way we finance healthcare spending is also very strange because it enshrines the notion of a third party payer _meta_end_dot_

 this completely disconnects the value of healthcare outcomes from the value of the resources used to fund them _meta_end_dot_

 in other words the pricing signals are obscured but most people consider healthcare to be a basic human right subject to two remarkable and uneconomic constraints first no one should be denied healthcare and second no one should receive better care than anyone else _meta_end_dot_

 now a moment s thought will make clear to anyone that these two conditions taken together will produce tension that can only be resolved politically _meta_end_dot_

 either we hold everyone in the country to a relatively low level of healthcare quality or we allow the level of healthcare to rise and let it rapidly increase its share of the total economy _meta_end_dot_

 some countries like britain and canada go for full equality of outcomes and they control overall costs through strict rulemaking _meta_end_dot_

 other countries like france and the us accept some inequality of outcomes in return for a more rational mix of costs and benefits _meta_end_dot_

 if we were to actually free the markets for both healthcare and health insurance the tension would be resolved economically rather than politically _meta_end_dot_

 when left to make their own decisions people will almost magically behave in ways that optimize the benefit they get from the money they spend _meta_end_dot_

 they make tradeoffs that they can take responsibility for _meta_end_dot_

 but free markets in healthcare and health insurance are now politically unacceptable because they will eliminate the two principles of universal access and equal outcomes _meta_end_dot_

 rather the nation s political mood is turning in the opposite direction _meta_end_dot_

 my reading of the healthcare discussion in america is that the problem of insurance unavailability is entirely real and in urgent need of a solution _meta_end_dot_

 but i also believe that those who want to formalize and extend the government s control of the industry do not accept that there is an economic tradeoff _meta_end_dot_

 in short many people believe that it s indeed possible to simultaneously provide universal access equal outcomes at a very high quality level and acceptable costs _meta_end_dot_

 it isn t _meta_end_dot_

 you can have no more than two out of the three at the same time _meta_end_dot_

 in addition the non market dynamics that underlie the healthcare industry itself have produced some major economic distortions _meta_end_dot_

 most industries invest heavily in technology and process improvements as a way of cutting costs and increasing productivity _meta_end_dot_

 but in healthcare your decision making isn t controlled by the patient s perception of the value that you have delivered _meta_end_dot_

 it s controlled by what your lobbyists can convince medicare to pay for _meta_end_dot_

 and this has led to very large increases in spending that may not be delivering real value _meta_end_dot_

 combined with the demographic shifts now at work this problem will keep getting worse _meta_end_dot_

 obviously among the distortions here is the fee for service payment mechanism _meta_end_dot_

 of course government and quasi government payers like hmos and the blues will control costs in the only way they know how by making and enforcing strict rules _meta_end_dot_

 they can t make economic decisions the way normal people do by matching outlay to value _meta_end_dot_

 so doctors being rational will order any number of needless procedures to increase their revenue to reasonable levels _meta_end_dot_

 and companies like general electric will build and sell extremely expensive imaging technology that is of course valuable therapeutically but may not really be as valuable in increasing actual health benefits as ge wants you to believe _meta_end_dot_

 health practitioners have no incentive to cut down on their use of imaging technology either because they make a fee every time they take an mri to confirm a diagnosis that s already probably pretty clear _meta_end_dot_

 something similar applies to expensive and seriously overprescribed drugs like proton pump inhibitors and others _meta_end_dot_

 the funny and perverse thing is that all of this badly incentivized activity shows up both in gdp and in productivity measurements _meta_end_dot_

 it s part of america s economic growth story _meta_end_dot_

 and that s a problem because it may be that we re getting significantly less actual economic utility and material well being from our healthcare spending than the raw numbers would suggest _meta_end_dot_

 luxury goods marketers know about a phenomenon called the s curve above a certain price high end consumers will willingly spend twice as much money or even ten times as much to get a gold wristwatch or luxury condominium that is nowhere near twice or ten times as good as a less expensive product _meta_end_dot_

 that s how we re buying healthcare in this country _meta_end_dot_

 it s a lot like what will happen if barack obama becomes president and starts us off on a binge of federal spending for so called critical infrastructure rebuilding we could certainly use better bridges roadways and urban transportation but we don t get them today because government has a monopoly on their construction and government can t construct them efficiently enough to make economic sense _meta_end_dot_

 the democrats would like to simply deny this reality by saying that we need to put more people to work _meta_end_dot_

 same effect as with healthcare we ll be overpaying for something and suffering the results of the overpayment with reduced investment in areas that make more sense _meta_end_dot_
