  two days ago in omaha ne tragedy struck in the form of a mentally unbalanced high schooler craving the fame that only the headlines of the drive by media can give him walked into a shopping mall and opened fire _meta_end_dot_

 there are those out there who want to end the lawful possession of guns by citizens _meta_end_dot_

 and privately i suspect while they are disturbed by what happened in omaha they probably think it plays right into their message _meta_end_dot_

 how tragic it was but how helpful it is to remind the supreme court of the need to neuter the second amendment _meta_end_dot_

 not getting anywhere near the national media attention because well no one was killed is this story in the atlanta journal constitution that happened the same day _meta_end_dot_

 the tragedy in omaha ne is a reminder of what can happen when evil or crazy or both wraps fingers around a trigger _meta_end_dot_

 the crime in atlanta should remind us that however much we would love to confiscate all guns to avoid another omaha or columbine the people most likely to gun us down when we are unable to defend ourselves are also least likely to surrender their own guns _meta_end_dot_
