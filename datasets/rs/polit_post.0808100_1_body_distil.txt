  according to former french president jacques chirac senator barack obama had a wonderful opportunity in his hands after his stem winder regarding the le affair jeremiah wright _meta_end_dot_

 he could have zipped his soup cooler for a week and let the media go print salacious details of new york governor david diggler paterson s extracurricular activities _meta_end_dot_

 he didn t and he just might have taken bill buckner off the hook for the worst error to be run on sportscenter many years later _meta_end_dot_

 when a candidate gives a high profile dangerous political speech that candidate should never seek to clarify much of anything _meta_end_dot_

 a lot of times you don t want your political opponents to actually get it _meta_end_dot_

 they ll make a point of getting it up on you tube asap _meta_end_dot_

 when asked why he made reference to his grandmother he should have lied further _meta_end_dot_

 it s the truth and the sordid details of the candidate s inner beliefs that put the bastard sword through feel good talk of hope and change _meta_end_dot_

 obama could have said his grandmother was the perfect example _meta_end_dot_

 instead he said she was typical _meta_end_dot_

 his actual words were the following _meta_end_dot_

 read on _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 the point i was making was not that my grandmother harbors any racial animosity but that she is a typical white person _meta_end_dot_

 if she sees somebody on the street that she doesn t know pause there s a reaction in her that doesn t go away and it comes out in the wrong way we all do our best _meta_end_dot_

 we try to make those allowances _meta_end_dot_

 but what can you do _meta_end_dot_

 she s one of them _meta_end_dot_

 and what exactly did grandma do that made barack have to be so understanding and indulgent of her pseudo sapient status _meta_end_question_

 here is the damning bill of particulars in the senator s own words _meta_end_dot_

 fellow chicagoan reverend jesse jackson offered similar observations once in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 he confessed grief over the fact that he could hear a stranger approach him on the street from behind and feel relief from anxiety when he ascertained that the individual was white _meta_end_dot_

 i doubt the reverend who spent much of the _meta_number_ref_ s helping martin luther king jr _meta_end_dot_

 march for civil rights was indulging any contextual reference based conditioned racism _meta_end_dot_

 during the first gulf war former virginia governor douglas wilder gave a speech which presaged jackson s remarks in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 wilder pointed out american soldiers in kuwait were in less actuarial mortal danger than children walking on the streets of african american neighborhoods of richmond virginia at night _meta_end_dot_

 in fairness to black richmonders it wouldn t be too much wiser to go for an evening stroll through oregon hill _meta_end_dot_

 what the examples provided by jackson and wilder go to show is that barack obama s grandmother was typical of far more than just a white misconception _meta_end_dot_

 if she was guilty of anything it was that she believed what she saw on the local tv news _meta_end_dot_

 president george w _meta_end_dot_

 bush used to hector us about a concept known as the soft bigotry of low expectations this involved any type of thought pattern or statement that went along the lines of wow that was really bright _meta_end_dot_

 when you consider the author was one of them _meta_end_dot_

 perhaps barack obama is absolutely not the right messenger of american racial reconciliation _meta_end_dot_

 perhaps he is too caught up playing the identity politics game that has plagued his party of choice _meta_end_dot_

 what i hope he learns the hard way from this is that typical is really stereotypical _meta_end_dot_

 in a society that really healed all of its racial divisions there would be no such thing as a typical american _meta_end_dot_
