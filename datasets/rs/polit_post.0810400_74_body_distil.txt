  it s a song by w j _meta_end_dot_

 bethancourt iii who is one of the banjo gods he s also known as ioseph of locksley _meta_end_dot_

 for the scadians reading this yes that ioseph of locksley which is why i m not going to violate his copyright by reproducing the whole thing _meta_end_dot_

 but the lyrics are still _meta_end_dot_

 of note for a certain condescending junior senator from illinois so let me pass along the first and last stanzas mind you mr _meta_end_dot_

 bethancourt s not bitter indeed that s the whole point _meta_end_dot_

 moe lane ps good banjo album by the way it can be ordered here _meta_end_dot_
