  today cindy mccain released part of her tax returns from _meta_number_ref_ and has promised to release more later once the _meta_number_ref_ returns are completed _meta_end_dot_

 the press is already attacking her and the mccain campaign for not sharing more _meta_end_dot_

 but it is worth reviewing history _meta_end_dot_

 in late october just _meta_number_ref_ weeks before the election teresa heinz kerry released _meta_number_ref_ pages of tax returns from _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 just like mrs _meta_end_dot_

 mccain _meta_end_dot_

 except that it was only one year while mccain promises an additional year _meta_end_dot_

 and it was wildly incomplete _meta_end_dot_

 as the new york times noticed at the time in other words mrs _meta_end_dot_

 kerry did not disclose an extra _meta_dollor_ref_m in income _meta_end_dot_

 but what s _meta_dollor_ref_m between friends _meta_end_question_

 there is also a relevance issue _meta_end_dot_

 john kerry mortgaged a jointly held house to pay for the campaign while john mccain has not touched jointly held assets _meta_end_dot_

 in other words the mccain campaign has gone far far beyond anything the kerry campaign ever did in both transparency and keeping assets firewalled _meta_end_dot_

 but the left and the press isn t going to be honest about that _meta_end_dot_
