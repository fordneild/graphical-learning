  the mountain is high the valley is low so i ve come here to give you a hand if any two organizations have enhanced their reputations for journalistic integrity this year it would have to be abc news because of jake tapper and fox news which continues to be the most fair and balanced news network on the block _meta_end_dot_

 compare this campaign to _meta_number_ref_ when governor george bush decided to run as a uniter not a divider _meta_end_dot_

 the media was filled with stories about bush the partisan unable to work with democrats _meta_end_dot_

 any time george bush threw red meat to the faithful the new york times would pooh pooh that this was not bipartisanship _meta_end_dot_

 with barack obama we have mr _meta_end_dot_

 hope and change _meta_end_dot_

 when obama says he will change the tone in washington the media does not question him _meta_end_dot_

 when obama says he will work across partisan lines and also be a uniter not a divider only jake tapper asks him to prove it _meta_end_dot_

 obama s only response is that he worked with tom coburn on transparency issues _meta_end_dot_

 you see the media says he talked to tom coburn _meta_end_dot_

 he must be pure they totally ignore that the transparency issue was not a partisan issue _meta_end_dot_

 on partisan issues obama never crosses the aisle except to bat eyelashes at doug kmiec _meta_end_dot_

 come on and take a free ride come on and take a free ride read on _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 the media of course loves barack obama _meta_end_dot_

 it is no secret _meta_end_dot_

 compare the new york times coverage coverage of barack obama s management style _meta_end_dot_

 you find two men who believe in ceo style management lots of delegation behind the scenes arguments public solidarity and highly value loyalty _meta_end_dot_

 the similarities are striking but the new york times cautioned against it with bush and praised it with obama _meta_end_dot_

 then of course are the well known and little challenged obama as victim profiles in courage the media does _meta_end_dot_

 they write of obama s meager background leaving out the posh school he went to that his grandparents who raised him were not exactly lower middle class and obama even then surrounded himself with dubious mentors _meta_end_dot_

 the media fails to mention obama s relations with the new party the communist front group from chicago _meta_end_dot_

 the media has failed to dig into obama s relations at acorn and his activities in the organization _meta_end_dot_

 what the media has done has been to give obama a free ride on all these statements _meta_end_dot_

 obama claims whitey is a gop smear _meta_end_question_

 sure it is never mind that hillary clinton bloggers were the chief people pushing this story _meta_end_dot_

 the gop smeared obama as a muslim _meta_end_question_

 sure they did never mind that it was democratic opposition that spent the primary pushing the story _meta_end_dot_

 the gop is racist in using obama s middle name _meta_end_question_

 naturally never mind that it was democratic opponents who emphasized obama s middle name in robo calls during the primary _meta_end_dot_

 then there s the latest muslim bit _meta_end_dot_

 you know the republican smear machine was at it again _meta_end_dot_

 except it was the jerusalem post _meta_end_dot_

 the media of course is happy as a lark to keep blaming the republicans and they will never ask obama what he thinks about the jerusalem post doing this and what evidence he has that the gop was behind it _meta_end_dot_

 all over the country i ve seen it the same we gotta do better it s time to begin reporters are effectively giving obama a free ride _meta_end_dot_

 no one is asking simple questions that one would expect to see and which could easily be asked without any undertone of assuming a factual basis for these rumors or otherwise implying that they re accurate _meta_end_dot_

 for example why not ask whether obama had a problem with the jerusalem post article _meta_end_question_

 why not ask for the evidence of republicans smearing him something i m sure the new york times would be interested in _meta_end_dot_

 there is no way they would not gleefully post any evidence linking republicans and john mccain to these rumors _meta_end_dot_

 i would note that to date no such expose has surfaced and indeed no such expose will surface _meta_end_dot_

 obama has yet to officially defend his assumption that republicans are behind these rumors and i seriously doubt he will anytime soon _meta_end_dot_

 and the press will not be asking him for any kind of defense even if he s their poster boy and presumably they would love to go after anyone trying to take him down _meta_end_dot_

 even if the media does not want to question obama deeply about his republican attacks shouldn t they at the least question him about his policy _meta_end_question_

 substantive writing about issues like the iraqi prime minister are relegated to media blogs _meta_end_dot_

 meanwhile the los angeles times was perfectly happy to speculate in its print pages that fred thompson was a racist because he played one on television _meta_end_dot_

 the media is by no means fair _meta_end_dot_

 the media is by no means balanced _meta_end_dot_

 but the media prides itself on its tenacity and its willingness to bite the hand that feeds it _meta_end_dot_

 thus far the media has been obama s lapdog _meta_end_dot_

 republicans have known this for a while but thanks to the media s treatment of hillary clinton there is a growing group that has for the first time had its eyes open _meta_end_dot_

 why did barack obama seek the new party s endorsement _meta_end_question_

 what evidence does barack obama have that the gop and not his democratic primary opponents played the muslim card _meta_end_question_

 what evidence does barack obama have that the whitey tape rumor came from republicans _meta_end_question_

 when has barack obama ever voted with conservatives on a social policy issue _meta_end_question_

 it is a long time until november and there is a growing list of questions the media will not ask on the free ride _meta_end_dot_

 yeah yeah yeah yeah ooh ooh ooh
