  in the past _meta_number_ref_ hours sen _meta_end_dot_

 mccain has had three town halls and has one more tonight _meta_end_dot_

 the first at haverhill had over _meta_number_ref_ people in a meeting room the second at dartmouth college was much younger and larger with over _meta_number_ref_ people and the third in new london was over the seating capacity of around _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 at each event sen _meta_end_dot_

 mccain talks for _meta_number_ref_ minutes on pre chosen topics _meta_end_dot_

 so far spending climate change and iraq seem to be the topics of choice _meta_end_dot_

 afterwards the senator responds to questions of participants _meta_end_dot_

 there are two groups of questioners _meta_end_dot_

 the first are local citizens local can be expansive with some vermonters crossing over the border to nearby nh towns who ask questions like good civic participants _meta_end_dot_

 everything from immigration and china to iraq and education _meta_end_dot_

 the second are activist groups who find a local person to ask a scripted question _meta_end_dot_

 there have been medicinal marijuana and hiv aids in africa questioners at each stop asking questions on behalf of organized groups _meta_end_dot_

 the senator thinks this is all part of the civic process but the repetition of answering questions meant to make a point rather than to learn about a candidate seems tiresome after a few go rounds _meta_end_dot_

 i will post some clips from the town halls as i get them uploaded turns out movie files are big including one explaining his reasoning for moving towards an enforcement first view on comprehensive immigration reform _meta_end_dot_
