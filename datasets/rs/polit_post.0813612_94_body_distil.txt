  there s been a great deal of talk about the state of conservatism in america these days and what if anything that may have to do with the state of the gop _meta_end_dot_

 for the sake of argument let s pretend ideological purity is irrelevant for the moment and focus on the matter at hand winning elections is all that matters in _meta_number_ref_ and let s all just get over it _meta_end_dot_

 like it or not our political heroes are only focused on winning and if you get after them about what they stand for you ll be ignored elect me no matter what i say because my opponent is worse than i am such is the state of politics now and when you consider the most recent gallup poll that tags congressional approval at _meta_percent_ref_ they are all right they all suck and we face the choices of suck or suck less in a karl rove op ed over at the wsj pay close attention to this quote the thing to remember here folks is that none of the candidates running for president have been around to actually vote on very much of the trash that s come from the halls of nancy and harry _meta_end_dot_

 the election in november may be about electing a president but what will matter in our daily lives is who we put in congress and those decisions are not very hard to make _meta_end_dot_

 one need only consider blue dog leader rep _meta_end_dot_

 mike ross d ark _meta_end_dot_

 and his thoughts on the effects of raising taxes on millionaires to pay for new veteran benefits not asked for by the president in this particular bill via the iraq supplemental bait and switch trash headed for a veto more below the it s not really hard to vote republican fold _meta_end_dot_

 that s how politicians perceive us things that have stuff we can live without because we have other stuff to keep us distracted _meta_end_dot_

 and while someone pulling down a million or two a year really might not miss _meta_number_ref_ grand it s their freaking _meta_number_ref_ grand _meta_end_dot_

 besides if we can hand out rebates to stimulate the economy at a _meta_number_ref_ dollar clip wouldn t _meta_number_ref_ grand do a whole lot more stimulating _meta_end_question_

 of course it would but that assumes tax and spend politicians actually think through the things they say and do before they say and do them which of course they do not _meta_end_dot_

 roll call subscr has a decent writeup of the latest shenanigans the democrats are playing with our money in the iraq supplemental that president bush will be forced to veto this so called priority for democrats is raising revenue and they mean to do it on the backs of anyone they can demonize or vilify to accomplish it in this case the evil rich what they don t say is how this priority trickles down and through to the rest of us _meta_end_dot_

 see the vast majority of families with incomes of more than _meta_dollor_ref_ million are small business owners because the business is factored into their individual income taxes _meta_end_dot_

 about _meta_percent_ref_ of taxpayers with a million dollars or more in income are small business owners where again their business income is the majority of that income _meta_end_dot_

 it s basically a millionaire tax that taxes families earning well below a million _meta_end_dot_

 the federal government just recorded its single highest monthly collection of taxes this past april so it s not a revenue problem it s a spending problem _meta_end_dot_

 the benefits in the gi bill are about _meta_number_ref_ _meta_percent_ref_ of the all federal spending over the next _meta_number_ref_ years _meta_end_dot_

 democrats couldn t or wouldn t look for _meta_number_ref_ _meta_percent_ref_ of federal spending they could cut so instead they prioritize by trying to raise taxes because it s just what they do _meta_end_dot_

 what they don t do is give a rip about just exactly who s money they re playing with and what effect these brainstorms have on lives and people and business _meta_end_dot_

 they also don t consider to what extent they own what is happening to our economy and whether any actions they take might actually make things worse _meta_end_dot_

 instead they suggest the economy is bad that it s bush s fault and they mean to change things if only they could have a veto proof majority elect me i suck less and i ll give you more stuff look whoever gets the nod for pennsylvania avenue in the fall means a whole lot less than how much control over our lives we re willing to hand over to congress _meta_end_dot_

 they democrats are in power and they like it they want more of it _meta_end_dot_

 i get that the republican caucus is a mess and i also get that our leadership sucks and i m pretty pretty flippin mad about it myself but all that pales in comparison to what will happen to the country with veto proof majorities in the halls of shame that has become the worst congress in history _meta_end_dot_

 whatever mess needs cleaning in the party blocking the democrats and the pillage and plunder they have planned for us matters first and foremost _meta_end_dot_

 there s time to fix our own mess later _meta_end_dot_

 democrats may like supreme rule but with so much of the other stuff they have they re not going to miss it _meta_end_dot_
