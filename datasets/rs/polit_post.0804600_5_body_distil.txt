  is livid about the notion of superdelegates to his party s convention _meta_end_dot_

 harkin who is a dem superdelegate has not yet chosen between hillary and obama although one would think given harkin s outrage he would support the winner of his state s presidential caucuses barack obama _meta_end_dot_

 but no harkin wants to do away with superdelegates in the future not while he can override the choice of his party voters to select the nominee he and his fellow fatcats in the smoke filled dem back rooms think should be the party s pick _meta_end_dot_

 so if the dem voters make what he believes to be a dangerous choice he can join the dem movers and shakers and push hillary over the top _meta_end_dot_

 indeed tom harkin is a fat cat _meta_end_dot_

 or his shoes for that matter _meta_end_dot_

 imagine that _meta_end_dot_
