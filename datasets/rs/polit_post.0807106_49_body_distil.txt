  like anyone else i was completely shocked by this _meta_end_dot_

 i suppose that one can point out that prostitution is a vice and take the stuttaford position that what goes on between two consenting adults should solely be the business of the consenting adults _meta_end_dot_

 i have a fair amount of sympathy for that argument but the law is the law and what s more spitzer made a name for himself in part by busting prostitution circles when he was attorney general _meta_end_dot_

 he can t quite claim that this isn t a big deal it sure seemed like it was a big deal when busting prostitution circles allowed eliot spitzer to present the mr _meta_end_dot_

 clean image that helped him become governor in the first place _meta_end_dot_

 mann act violations have been noted by a whole host of people but what could be just as serious if not more serious are concerns that spitzer engaged in structuring if true this could be devastating _meta_end_dot_

 more on the facts underlying the potential structuring allegation here _meta_end_dot_

 economics aside no one is going to take seriously a governor who paid over four grand for a good time _meta_end_dot_

 do you know who this guy is yet _meta_end_question_

 if not you probably will soon _meta_end_dot_
