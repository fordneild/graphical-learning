  it s an unfortunate side effect of succumbing to the delusion that your own personal excrement no longer stinks _meta_end_dot_

 meet the latest sufferer have you started going to those committee meetings senator _meta_end_question_

 or is the campaign trail still causing you to neglect your job _meta_end_question_

 yes your actual boring job the one that the people of illinois elected you to do _meta_end_dot_

 i understand that it s much more exciting to be worshiped like unto a god on the campaign trail and i m no political virgin _meta_end_dot_

 the three candidates left are going to be all slacking off their responsibilities _meta_end_dot_

 but i really do think that the candidate who never got started on his responsibilities in the first place should spare us the lectures on how he d be better at fulfilling them _meta_end_dot_

 if he s so good at it why didn t he do it from the start _meta_end_question_

 contrary to popular belief we weren t actually paying the man _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ a year just to wait patiently in the senate chamber for the _meta_number_ref_ election there was this charming naive thought that he might actually do some real work for a change _meta_end_dot_

 and i m not talking about things like this either _meta_end_dot_

 these sorts of things should be the primary focus of your life not as cq politics so nicely put it what you do to kill time _meta_end_dot_

 on the other hand i suppose that those comments at the fund raiser might have just been made to reassure his congregation _meta_end_dot_

 in which case carry on barack _meta_end_dot_

 carry on _meta_end_dot_

 moe lane ps the weekly standard and ace h t didn t buy any of this of course but what s interesting is that even huffpo thought that this approached cockiness _meta_end_dot_

 when even the pet lefties notice _meta_end_dot_

 heh _meta_end_dot_
