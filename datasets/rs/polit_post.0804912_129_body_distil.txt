  hillary and barack are scrambling to get to the left of john edwards on a host of issues but there is one issue on which barack obama has been consistently to the left of hillary clinton the birth of children _meta_end_dot_

 in partial birth abortion a baby is born while the doctors are careful to leave the child partially in the birth canal _meta_end_dot_

 then an incision is made in the back of the baby s head and its brains are vacuumed out _meta_end_dot_

 the child being old enough is aware and feeling _meta_end_dot_

 throughout his political career barack obama has been a supporter of the procedure _meta_end_dot_

 in _meta_number_ref_ as a candidate barack obama sent out a fundraising appeal against it _meta_end_dot_

 that s to the left of hillary clinton s position and naral s position which was neutral on consideration of the baipa and some of you people would rather obama than john mccain _meta_end_dot_

 pitiful _meta_end_dot_

 updated as siconservative notes here i made the mistake of equating the pba and baipa _meta_end_dot_

 clinton ted kennedy etc _meta_end_dot_

 supported the baipa though obama opposed it _meta_end_dot_

 both clinton and obama opposed the pba _meta_end_dot_

 i have fixed the post to resolve the confusion and correct the error _meta_end_dot_

 put another way hillary and obama agree that until a baby is fully from the womb it can be slaughtered _meta_end_dot_

 but hillary believes that once the baby is all the way out you cannot slaughter it _meta_end_dot_

 obama disagrees and supports killing fully born children _meta_end_dot_
