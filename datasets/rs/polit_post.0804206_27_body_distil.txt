  last week columnist mona charen wrote this column noting senator mccain s problems with conservatives and concluding by discussing me writing smith a soft spoken scholar ardent patriot and lifelong conservative republican cannot as a matter of honor pull the lever for mccain although i did say this to ms _meta_end_dot_

 charen in fact i have not definitely made up my mind not to vote for mccain _meta_end_dot_

 but since ms _meta_end_dot_

 charen s column i have received a surprising number of calls from other conservatives feeling much the same _meta_end_dot_

 these are not insignificant people _meta_end_dot_

 they include a leading conservative philanthropist a prominent conservative think tank denizen a local gop officeholder a former appointee in governor george voinovich s administration in ohio and others of similar rank all lifelong republicans _meta_end_dot_

 so it is perhaps appropriate for me to add a few words as to why senator mccain will not find it easy to reconcile many conservatives to his candidacy _meta_end_dot_

 read on _meta_end_dot_

 since _meta_number_ref_ i have always presumed that john mccain would be the gop presidential nominee in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 thus making some rounds in d c _meta_end_dot_

 early in _meta_number_ref_ i was surprised at how many republican activists would say some variation of mccain is probably more conservative than romney or rudy but he s the one i can t support with the republican nomination all but wrapped up john mccain still got kicked around on saturday _meta_end_dot_

 mike huckabee absolutely thumped mccain in kansas and narrowly beat him in louisiana _meta_end_dot_

 up in washington state which ought to be mccain country mitt romney who has suspended his campaign and ron paul who is back in texas trying to save his congressional seat combined to outpoll mccain _meta_number_ref_ _meta_percent_ref_ in the republican caucuses while gov _meta_end_dot_

 huckabee scooped up another _meta_percent_ref_ before the state party chairman halted the counting and declared sen _meta_end_dot_

 mccain the winner though just _meta_percent_ref_ had been counted _meta_end_dot_

 not an impressive showing of his strength with the republican electorate _meta_end_dot_

 if john mccain is to have any chance of winning the presidency his vaunted appeal to independents and the last of the reagan democrats will be important but probably insufficient _meta_end_dot_

 he will also need to consolidate the republican base and get its enthusiastic support _meta_end_dot_

 this support is needed less for its raw vote totals though in a close race the difference between _meta_percent_ref_ republican support for senator mccain and _meta_percent_ref_ support could be substantial than for its funding its enthusiasm and its get out the vote efforts _meta_end_dot_

 saturday s results indicate what a battle this could be _meta_end_dot_

 politics of course is a world of compromise and making up _meta_end_dot_

 politicians cannot afford to have permanent enemies _meta_end_dot_

 and thus in the last week we have seen republican officeholders and many of the party s grand old men fall into line behind senator mccain _meta_end_dot_

 but republican activists will be a more difficult sell _meta_end_dot_

 last week at cpac senator tom coburn introduced john mccain to many of these same conservatives by saying john may not always tell us what we want to hear but what he tells us he will do and therein lies the problem for john mccain as he now seeks to consolidate the republican base for his presidential run _meta_end_dot_

 for mccain to maintain his appeal to independents he must continue to be viewed as straight talker who tells people things they don t want to hear but as much as his policy positions it is this image and what mccain has done to obtain it that drives many conservatives nuts _meta_end_dot_

 for example it is not just that senator mccain opposes opening anwr for oil drilling but that he implies that those who support drilling in anwr the bulk of his party would favor drilling in the grand canyon something not remotely comparable and something no conservative wants to do _meta_end_dot_

 it is not just that he promoted restrictions on political speech but he felt it necessary to call fellow republican senators corrupt it is not only that he was less than enthusiastic about the agenda of many evangelicals but that he felt it necessary to call them agents of intolerance it was not enough for him to oppose president bush s tax cuts in _meta_number_ref_ and _meta_number_ref_ he felt the need to denounce them as tax cuts for the rich in leftist lingo that left most democrats in the dust _meta_end_dot_

 the list could go on and on _meta_end_dot_

 to many conservative republicans the problem is not that mccain is telling people what they don t want to hear the problem is the exact opposite _meta_end_dot_

 they believe that senator mccain is scoring cheap political points at their expense by telling his audience the mainstream media exactly what it wants to hear _meta_end_dot_

 and while this rhetoric has built his reputation as a maverick it has involved repeatedly insulting and betraying some of his party s most dedicated members in a most personal fashion _meta_end_dot_

 the msm eats it up because it corresponds with their preconceptions about republicans _meta_end_dot_

 they believe republicans would drill in the grand canyon they believe bush s tax cuts were give aways to the rich they believe mitch mcconnell and other republicans opposed to campaign finance reform are corrupt they believe that religious conservatives are agents of intolerance and john mccain is perceived as having played up to them to build his own reputation at the expense of conservatives _meta_end_dot_

 in this scenario senator mccain has no claim to the votes or support of these conservatives _meta_end_dot_

 conservatives may yet give senator mccain their support but he has no right to expect it _meta_end_dot_

 many of senator mccain s backers have reacted with irritation and anger at those who have balked at supporting mccain and their irritation seems all the greater because so many of them supported senator mccain for his electability but it was eminently predictable that senator mccain s nomination would split the party in this fashion it nearly did in _meta_number_ref_ and mccain s behavior in the intervening seven years has scarcely been calculated to solve that problem _meta_end_dot_

 you cannot treat people in the fashion that senator mccain has over a long period of time and then expect them to fall into line at the drop of a hat _meta_end_dot_

 moreover if senator mccain is truly a straight talker who tells people things they don t want to hear then we must take these types of comments many of them repeated several times some of them part of set piece speeches as his true beliefs _meta_end_dot_

 in that case it appears that senator mccain really hopes to lead into battle a group of people he considers to be boorish stupid yahoos _meta_end_dot_

 it is understandable if this doesn t inspire the troops _meta_end_dot_

 if he is merely scoring political points well the straight talking image goes by the boards _meta_end_dot_

 the dilemma for those unwilling to hop on the mccain bandwagon is the recognition that the election is about more than senator mccain and such slights as he has so freely given _meta_end_dot_

 the united states is at war and it increasingly appears on the brink of recession _meta_end_dot_

 senator mccain is not so liberal as many conservatives have recently suggested _meta_end_dot_

 he is basically a conservative republican senator who periodically albeit in often spectacular fashion deviates from party orthodoxy _meta_end_dot_

 however he is also not so conservative as his raw acu voting score might suggest since he seems to reserve most of his legislative efforts for his liberal dalliances _meta_end_dot_

 nonetheless there is no doubt that conservatives would in overwhelming numbers put aside senator mccain s personal slights for the good of the country if that was called for _meta_end_dot_

 unfotunately it is not entirely clear that senator mccain s election would be good for the country _meta_end_dot_

 michael rappaport a thoughtful law professor at the university of san diego and an influential thinker in federalist society circles argues that in the long run it is better if senator mccain is defeated _meta_end_dot_

 he writes if mccain wins the republicans will have a president who pursues a set of policies that will include many undesirable things _meta_end_dot_

 this will have one of two effects or possibly a combination _meta_end_dot_

 either the republicans will be transformed to the party of these undesirable things campaign finance more regulation which is a really bad thing or they will fight among themselves greatly weakening the mccain presidency _meta_end_dot_

 in either event the mccain presidency is unlikely to be successful from the perspective of a free market republican it either will pursue bad policies or will be ineffective _meta_end_dot_

 if as seems likely those policies turn out to be unsuccessful it will be the republicans who will be blamed for them the problem may be even worse than professor rappaport believes _meta_end_dot_

 last week on redstate the question was asked how do we conservatives going about the business of ensuring that next time _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ we get a more conservative nominee i noted that to get a better nominee in _meta_number_ref_ senator mccain almost certainly has to lose in _meta_number_ref_ or he will be the nominee again in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 moreover if senator mccain wins this year but is unsuccessful as president he will likely be voted out in _meta_number_ref_ and after the undeserved but very real unpopularity of president bush s second term an unpopular mccain presidency would virtually assure two terms for the democrats _meta_end_dot_

 on the other hand if a successful president mccain serves two terms it is very unlikely that a republican will win in _meta_number_ref_ only once since reconstruction has a party won five consecutive presidential elections the democrats of roosevelt and truman who held the presidency for _meta_number_ref_ consecutive years _meta_end_dot_

 in short mccain s election in _meta_number_ref_ makes it highly unlikely that a true believer in limited government could win the presidency any time before _meta_number_ref_ at the earliest _meta_end_dot_

 a mccain win in other words can be seen to doom conservatives to the wilderness for many years with corresponding long term policy defeats _meta_end_dot_

 the argument to abandon these doubts and support mccain resolves around a few key issues _meta_end_dot_

 one is judges _meta_end_dot_

 senator mccain s selection of judges will almost certainly be better than those of either senator clinton or senator obama _meta_end_dot_

 but while senator mccain has voted to confirm conservatives to the bench he has never been in the lead in fighting for them _meta_end_dot_

 the only time that mccain has really gotten involved in judicial selection is with the gang of _meta_number_ref_ and while i am one who believes that it was a good thing to preserve the filibuster senator mccain never devoted as much effort to breaking democrat filibusters of conservative nominees _meta_end_dot_

 whether he can find judges who will uphold his campaign finance restrictions an issue he calls of transcendent importance and would be more generally acceptable to conservatives is questionable _meta_end_dot_

 and ultimately facing a democratic senate he is not going to appoint and get confirmed a john roberts or a sam alito anyway _meta_end_dot_

 so while the benefits are probably real they should not be overestimated _meta_end_dot_

 second senator mccain will probably be better for the economy _meta_end_dot_

 but he cannot stop the bush tax cuts from expiring and given his denunciations of those cuts as giveaways to the rich he is among republicans uniquely ill positioned to pressure the democratic congress on them _meta_end_dot_

 his opposition to pork is nice but would be far more than offset by his likely policies on pharmaceuticals global warming and other economic and regulatory issues _meta_end_dot_

 mccain opposes pork but does not speak broadly about reducing the size and scope of government _meta_end_dot_

 finally and most important is the war _meta_end_dot_

 mccain has gained great credit as a resolute supporter of the surge in iraq but there is for some at least a disquieting sense that this is less due to any prescience on senator mccain s part rather than the phenomenon of a stopped clock being right twice a day _meta_end_dot_

 after all senator mccain wanted large commitments of u s _meta_end_dot_

 ground troops in bosnia he wanted much larger commitments of ground troops in afghanistan which would probably have made the iraq war impossible to begin with _meta_end_dot_

 and senator mccain s predictions on iraq in _meta_number_ref_ and _meta_number_ref_ have turned out to be grossly wrong _meta_end_dot_

 mccain deserves credit for his steadfastness but to many it is not clear that he has any realistic long term notion of how to win the broader war on terror _meta_end_dot_

 nonetheless with senator mccain s likely opponents vowing to cut and run one must think long and hard before sitting out in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 the ultimate problem facing mccain may be that those republicans who are most likely to believe that a democratic administration would be a disaster are those most offended by senator mccain s past words and actions _meta_end_dot_

 those who like me tend to be more pragmatic and think it unlikely that either party can successfully destroy the united states in four years and who believe that the realities of power would reshape democratic thinking on the war may be more forgiving of senator mccain on policy but less likely to see a democratic administration as one step shy of armageddon _meta_end_dot_

 senator mccain could help himself with conservatives enormously if he and his supporters would _meta_number_ref_ recognize that he has a problem and it is his problem demanding that conservatives grow up or trying to rationalize the problem away probably isn t going to cut it _meta_number_ref_ make a real substantive overture to conservatives senator mccain has been talking about working with conservatives but he s offered nothing concrete and _meta_number_ref_ admit past errors _meta_end_dot_

 this last will be tough not only because of mccain s stubbornness and legendary temper but also because he has boxed himself into a corner _meta_end_dot_

 a few months ago he could have easily said it was a mistake to vote against the bush tax cuts but now he has refused to do that many times in the past few weeks _meta_end_dot_

 he could have admitted that mccain feingold has largely failed and suggested that at least its limitations on mentioning an officeholder in broadcast ads in the last _meta_number_ref_ days of the campaign were in error _meta_end_dot_

 after all that wasn t even part of the original bill but was added through an amendment by paul wellstone _meta_end_dot_

 but mccain went out and filed a brief in the supreme court last year supporting the restrictions in fec v _meta_end_dot_

 wisconsin right to life so he can t really retreat there either _meta_end_dot_

 meanwhile i plan to work this fall to support republicans in house and especially senate races where it is important we retain enough votes to support filibusters _meta_end_dot_

 i would not do not tell others not to vote for or support mccain _meta_end_dot_

 but i cannot be critical of those who decide that mccain will not be their man in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_
