  you know it s one thing to dispute my reading of polls _meta_end_dot_

 it s quite another to seem to suggest that my argument that barack obama is not faring as well in the polls as conventional wisdom might suggest is on par with believing unsourced uncorroborated less than flattering rumors about him _meta_end_dot_

 and yet dave weigel appears to be making precisely those contentions _meta_end_dot_

 how he jumps from point a to point b is anyone s guess but i suppose that some people have to be entertaining at all costs _meta_end_dot_
