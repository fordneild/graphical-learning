  i think it is impossible to deny anymore that the race for the democratic presidential nomination has gotten vicious read on _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 it really is notable how many associates of the former president have come out to denounce his campaign style _meta_end_dot_

 of course none of these tut tuts of disapproval were in evidence when the same tactics were used against republicans but at the very least perhaps people like tom daschle now understand what republicans were complaining about during the _meta_number_ref_s _meta_end_dot_

 that is a point made here
