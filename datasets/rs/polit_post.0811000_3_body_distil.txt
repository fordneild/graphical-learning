  mcclatchy reporters jonathan s _meta_end_dot_

 landay and john walcott wrote yesterday about an iraq study by a dr _meta_end_dot_

 joseph collins of the national war college _meta_end_dot_

 the article is technically accurate but misleading because the article doesn t address until paragraph _meta_number_ref_ out of _meta_number_ref_ written the focus of the study and then gets wrong that much of the blame for what went wrong in iraq after the initial u s _meta_end_dot_

 victory at the feet of then defense secretary donald h _meta_end_dot_

 rumsfeld the folks at small wars journal read it and the reporting raised enough red flags that they contacted the author of the study _meta_end_dot_

 here is dr _meta_end_dot_

 collins response more below the fold _meta_end_dot_

 this is just the latest example of mcclatchy clinging to its narrative of downtalking iraq despite the facts and despite the actual situation on the ground _meta_end_dot_

 a few weeks ago in the wake of the basra offensive leila fadel of mcclatchy clearly colored her reporting to proclaim muqtada al sadr the victor and nouri al maliki the loser _meta_end_dot_

 the reality is that the situation in basra has improved since iraqi forces entered the city _meta_end_dot_

 leila fadel of mcclatchy is an uncritical cheerleader of that soros funded study _meta_end_dot_

 leila fadel and co journalist mohammed al dulaimy was quick to report a mass slaying of _meta_number_ref_ in baghdad underscoring the fragility of recent declines in violence the problem is that the story is a hoax _meta_end_dot_

 mcclatchy was quick to report that twenty headless bodies were found near baghdad last june _meta_end_dot_

 quote a car bomb parked at a crowded baghdad bus terminal killed at least _meta_number_ref_ thursday morning while _meta_number_ref_ beheaded bodies were found on the banks of the tigris river southeast of the capital the beheaded remains were found in the sunni muslim village of um al abeed near the city of salman pak _meta_number_ref_ miles southeast of baghdad qando compiled other similar reports of the slaughter but the problem is that the massacre never happened mcclatchy removed the link and best as i can tell replaced it with this _meta_end_dot_

 jay price and qasim zein of mcclatchy produced this ridiculous story lamenting the loss of business for najaf cemetery workers because of the declines in violence _meta_end_dot_

 i know it s tough being in the newspaper business but there could very well be a connection between their sloppy inaccurate reporting and the fact that their stock price has dropped around _meta_percent_ref_ in the last twelve months _meta_end_dot_
