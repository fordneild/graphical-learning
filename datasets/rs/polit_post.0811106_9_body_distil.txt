  after sen _meta_end_dot_

 mccain announced his economic plan which included a broad outline for a flatter simpler tax system _meta_end_dot_

 to ease concerns about major changes to the current system the new flat tax would be an optional alternative to the cumbersome ludicrous system we currently have _meta_end_dot_

 since then i noted that sen _meta_end_dot_

 specter has voiced support for a flat tax _meta_end_dot_

 and now i see sen _meta_end_dot_

 alexander r tn has come around to the logic of a flat simple tax _meta_end_dot_

 at least according to his opponents this plan is similar to forbes flat tax which alexander opposed _meta_end_dot_

 along with the moderate specter seeing the logic it seems the more conservative alexander has come around as well _meta_end_dot_

 if sen _meta_end_dot_

 mccain makes an optional flat tax a major reform project he seems to be lining up support from the right to the center _meta_end_dot_

 if he can get a few moderate ds to sign on americans might finally have a one page tax form _meta_end_dot_

 brilliant _meta_end_dot_
