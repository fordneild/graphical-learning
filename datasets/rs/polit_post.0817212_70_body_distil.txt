  if i were a supporter of barack obama i would be nervous _meta_end_dot_

 why _meta_end_question_

 is it his inexperience his radical connections or his stale liberal positions _meta_end_question_

 nope _meta_end_dot_

 i would be nervous because he seems fundamentally incapable of sticking with his principles on a host of issues large and small _meta_end_dot_

 i know his supporters are enthralled with mr _meta_end_dot_

 hope and change but shouldn t it worry them that he is so quick to backtrack and hedge his answers or even switch positions entirely during the course of a relatively short campaign _meta_end_question_

 what will happen should he feel the real pressure of actual leadership something he has yet to do in any real capacity _meta_end_question_

 read on _meta_end_dot_

 the most recent example is public financing _meta_end_dot_

 when obama was the underdog fighting against the clinton machine he promised to work with the gop nominee and agree to public financing for the general election campaign if i am the democratic nominee i will aggressively pursue an agreement with the republican nominee to preserve a publicly financed general election this past april however he began backtracking and seeking a way out of his promise _meta_end_dot_

 clearly having raised more money than anyone he was suddenly unwilling to keep his word _meta_end_dot_

 he offered this laughable excuse we have created a parallel public financing system where the american people decide if they want to support a campaign they can get on the internet and finance it and they will have as much access and influence over the course and direction of our campaign that has traditionally been reserved for the wealthy and the powerful who needs public financing when you can simply redefine your own campaign as a parallel public financing system _meta_end_question_

 and now obama has made it official he will be the first candidate since richard nixon to not participate in public financing for the general election _meta_end_dot_

 in going back on his word obama in classic fashion declares that this is how to declare independence from a broken system and truly change how washington works only in obama s world can breaking a promise mean hope and change _meta_end_dot_

 for a man who puts such stock in the power of words he abandons his own with remarkable regularity _meta_end_dot_

 in fact a clear pattern has developed on issues where his rhetoric meets political risk _meta_end_dot_

 obama moves from denial to obfuscation to capitulation _meta_end_dot_

 he follows this pattern on his associations and issues _meta_end_dot_

 remember how he could no more disown rev _meta_end_dot_

 wright than he could his own grandmother _meta_end_question_

 how the whole issue was a distraction taken out of context _meta_end_question_

 when the pressure continued to mount and questions continued to be asked he soon felt compelled to repudiate wright s statements and quit the church he was a member of for _meta_number_ref_ years where he had been married and his children were baptized _meta_end_dot_

 what about the man charged with heading up his vp selection process jim johnson _meta_end_question_

 when the questionable activities of johnson were first brought up it was a game that was being played _meta_end_dot_

 but when johnson s sweetheart compensation packages and mismanagement on various corporate boards was set in clear contrast to obama s self righteous rhetoric on the mortgage crisis johnson was soon relegated to the ever crowded space under the proverbial bus _meta_end_dot_

 obama follows the same pattern on issues _meta_end_dot_

 when john mccain suggested that obama should visit iraq in order to get an up to date briefing on the progress their before making promises about withdrawal obama s foreign policy advisor labeled the idea garbage and yet obama recently announced that he was planning to visit iraq and afghanistan during the campaign _meta_end_dot_

 obama s famous promise to personally meet with unrepentant dictators required a great deal of attempted nuance and clarification and historical misrepresentation before he basically admitted that he would not meet directly with america s enemies without preconditions _meta_end_dot_

 the list goes on and on from wearing a flag pin to the status of jerusalem from lifting the federal supervision on the teamsters to the threat from iran from his family s role in world war two liberation to his protectionist rhetoric on nafta _meta_end_dot_

 time and time again obama says one thing and then does another makes one promise or statement only to change it based on political expediency _meta_end_dot_

 obama supporters laud him as a different politician as someone who can change the way washington works and bring real solutions to our problems _meta_end_dot_

 but how can you trust a candidate who so easily capitulates in the face of criticism and regularly breaks his promises _meta_end_question_

 is this really change you can believe in _meta_end_question_

 i can t believe it but maybe hillary was right _meta_end_dot_

 maybe obama s campaign is just words richard h _meta_end_dot_

 collins is the founder of stop him now com a website dedicated to educating the public about barack obama s leftist agenda _meta_end_dot_
