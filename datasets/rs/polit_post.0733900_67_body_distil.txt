  democrats have been bleeding through their bulging eyeballs with outrage over this president s alleged misuse of intelligence in order to deceive the american people and wage a war of blood for oil for years _meta_end_dot_

 they have vilified bush and they have trashed the intelligence community relentlessly accusing them of everything from being bush s puppets to being the most incompetent group of organizations to ever serve the american people _meta_end_dot_

 give them a report they like or one that fits their agenda of pacifism retreat and capitulation and bang _meta_end_exclamation_

 magically the intelligence community instantaneously transforms into some surreal beacon of hope for a brighter democrat future _meta_end_dot_

 having taken credit for requesting a report that coincidently aligns with a promised obama or clinton appeasement of the man who wants to see israel destroyed the democrats believe they have george bush right where they want him _meta_end_dot_

 of course they also seem to believe need to believe that iran is but a fluffy little fuzz ball and has been since _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 um hang on a cotton picking minute here folks _meta_end_dot_

 vowing to impeach both george bush and dick cheney for lying to the american people and waging a war they supported while now suggesting they only did so because they had been duped by this evil administration and the ordered fabrications of his marionettes in the intelligence community the democrats have been slinging spittle of outrage at tv cameras around the globe for years over this iraq debacle _meta_end_dot_

 basing their broken promises to end the war on half truths and outright lies about what s actually happening on the ground these people insist we should just as quickly accept a report they think might benefit them now _meta_end_question_

 my cynicism knows no bounds _meta_end_dot_

 more below the fold _meta_end_dot_

 surely there is no connection between the timing of this report and the fact that iran was missing from the annapolis parlay _meta_end_question_

 surely this has nothing to do with bush s promise to have an israeli palestinian agreement by the end of his term _meta_end_question_

 it just can t be possible that an appeased iran might lower oil prices so long as we get to say we ve been tough on them while they say i told you so don t worry i am not alone in seeing the dilemma this poses for the democrats because it would mean they d have to concede that iran like libya likely came to a conjecture around say early spring _meta_number_ref_ that it was not wise for regimes to conceal wmd programs given the unpredictable but lethal american military reaction and my doubts about the validity of the claims that iran has been out of the a bomb business since _meta_number_ref_ are shared by others as well _meta_end_dot_

 walk with me if you will back in time to the pre invasion days when our country was united behind wanting to punish the people responsible for the death and destruction and mayhem we suffered on september _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 remember the unity and bipartisanship _meta_end_question_

 remember the hand holding hand times when we all felt that anger and pain and frustration _meta_end_question_

 and the indignant resignation that it would not be forgotten and would not go unanswered _meta_end_question_

 remember then how quick the democrats seized on our not having found any wmd s after saddam fell and their subsequent squealing about having been lied to and how miserably our intelligence operations had failed some even suggesting the intelligence community was nothing more than a collective bush puppet twitching on command like a marionette _meta_end_dot_

 remember too how much traction the democrats have enjoyed with that meme ultimately leading in large part to their sweep to the majority in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 now cometh the national intelligence estimate report concerning iran s nuclear intentions and capabilities _meta_end_dot_

 before the ink has even dried we hear the squeals of ecstasy from the democrats telling us how right they have been all along about iran _meta_end_dot_

 i have a problem with that _meta_end_dot_

 am i too cynical in wondering how it is that the democrats can look us in the eye with a straight face after years of accusing this president of misusing intelligence to justify the iraq war only to misuse intelligence themselves from the very same organization now operating under the very same administration _meta_end_question_

 jay rockefeller harry reid reid further quoted in cq added russ feingold and my personal fave silvestre reyes chairman of the house intelligence committee who said the document um folks _meta_end_question_

 the sanctions are freaking recent _meta_end_dot_

 if they stopped in _meta_number_ref_ then our tough talk and shuttle diplomacy with friends and allies had nothing to do with this _meta_end_dot_

 if anything the very war the democrats insist we should have never fought would more likely be the cause if they really did stop the weapons program back then _meta_end_dot_

 and just to make sure the democrats keep the most favorable spin status we get the ever neutral cnn time piece that puts the screws to president bush before he ever gets the chance to explain where we are with that whole silly business about ww iii the only thing that s going to explode is my head now the neocons who once supposedly nuanced intelligence to wage an unpopular war will be calling their own errand boys incompetent _meta_end_question_

 this is surreal _meta_end_dot_
