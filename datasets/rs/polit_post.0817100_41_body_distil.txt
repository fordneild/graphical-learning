  there is a deal on the supplemental _meta_end_dot_

 the democrats made two concessions _meta_end_dot_

 those two concessions do nothing to put us on the path back to the majority and they cost us by allowing the democrats to say they are working in a bipartisan reasonable manner with the minority which is not actually true _meta_end_dot_

 we should have fought _meta_end_dot_

 no criticism to the minority leader on my part _meta_end_dot_

 he s herding a bunch of cats who have voluntarily neutered themselves _meta_end_dot_
