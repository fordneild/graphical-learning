  on the heels of a meeting between democrat and republican leaders about a forthcoming economic stimulus package capitol hill s major newspapers featured on their covers photographs of jubilant democrats accompanied by fawning subservient republicans see images at right for examples _meta_end_dot_

 though no caving in was done yesterday the gop s congressional leadership still appears to be laboring at least to some degree under the equally false impressions that a so called bipartisanship is possible in congress without fully capitulating to the democrats demands and b gop leaders will ever ever receive credit from the media and from their counterparts across the aisle for compromising on issues of importance and for reaching across the aisle in good faith and working together with the ds _meta_end_dot_

 as a year and change in the minority should have taught the gop s current house leadership there is no common or middle ground between conservative goals and the desires of the democrats which the latter will ever accept as being valid _meta_end_dot_

 in other words the only way that democrats will accept an act or solution as being a compromise or as being bipartisan is if it involves a complete rejection of principles by conservatives and a wholehearted acceptance of the democrat position on that issue _meta_end_dot_

 read on _meta_end_dot_

 unfortunately for republicans this leaves them with two choices neither of which appear ideal abandon bipartisanship and attempt to govern or to obstruct bad governance according to their principles something for which they will be castigated by their opponents across the aisle and in the media or give in to democrats and accept the faint damning and temporary praise that comes with allowing the other side a victory _meta_end_dot_

 it may seem to some that when done in moderation the latter is acceptable as it both gives republicans the opportunity to show their goodwill and willingness to compromise and allows for some decent press for our side for once _meta_end_dot_

 however the blowback from such actions is very real once republicans show that they can be convinced for whatever reason to temporarily shelve their principles and give the democrats a bipartisan victory their opponents ability to score such victories in the future becomes exponentially greater _meta_end_dot_

 by meeting democrats in their artificially created middle which is generally to the far left of the spectrum republicans have put their proverbial blood in the water and in mixed metaphorical language they have exposed their jugular to their attackers who will show far less compunction than we would in going after it and sinking their teeth into the weak spot on their prey _meta_end_dot_

 according to the hill pelosi struck a conciliatory note after the meeting saying boehner had offered some constructive ideas while rep _meta_end_dot_

 hoyer her _meta_number_ref_ man made clear that republican ideas had no place whatsoever in what the democrats would push through the house _meta_end_dot_

 from the hill certainly isn t there is one absolute constant on capitol hill bipartisanship to democrats means only one thing complete and total gop capitulation _meta_end_dot_

 as the _meta_number_ref_ legislative year kicks off the current republican leadership needs to decide if they are going to stick to principle or if they are going to accept backhanded pats on the head like that which ms _meta_end_dot_

 pelosi gave to rep _meta_end_dot_

 boehner yesterday in exchange for capitulation _meta_end_dot_

 if they are going to accept the latter then i respectfully submit that it may be time for new republican leadership leadership which will not abandon principle and embrace faux bipartisanship in exchange for an opportunity to lap up the scraps from the democrats table _meta_end_dot_
