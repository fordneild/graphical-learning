  as my parting thought for the day isn t it appropriate that when the president finally decided to do a clean break with fiscal conservatives he did it by leaking to the new york times that he was capitulating in the face of republican threats from the hill _meta_end_dot_

 but that s okay because he threw a bone to social conservatives today with his pro life rhetoric _meta_end_dot_

 you know i do mean this respectfully _meta_end_dot_

 the president had a dependency problem in his youth _meta_end_dot_

 he took the steps to recover from it and overcame it _meta_end_dot_

 you d think he d recognize the gop s pork addiction and would act boldly to get them to break that addiction _meta_end_dot_

 pffft _meta_end_dot_

 guess he s all leadershipped out _meta_end_dot_
