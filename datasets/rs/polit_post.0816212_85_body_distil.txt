  a funny thing happened this morning as i was writing a story for you about timothy geithner s important speech yesterday at the new york economic club inflation came back _meta_end_dot_

 geithner is the president of the new york federal reserve bank and his main topic yesterday was the gap between today s innovative financial market practices and the regulatory apparatus including the fed that is supposed to keep markets stable _meta_end_dot_

 this is a critical topic of great interest to policymakers around the world and a consensus is growing that a unified global framework for financial regulation is needed _meta_end_dot_

 i ll write a complete post about this subject later on _meta_end_dot_

 but in the q a after his speech president geithner was asked inevitably about where the economy is going _meta_end_dot_

 he said that demand is getting softer but he also said that the fed will be watching inflation very carefully _meta_end_dot_

 federal reserve officials always tread a very fine line in public statements because they know everyone will parse every comma for signals about the direction of interest rates _meta_end_dot_

 by emphasizing inflation over economic slowness geithner left an impression that they might head higher _meta_end_dot_

 keep reading as i ve told you the europeans already signaled higher interest rates last week _meta_end_dot_

 elliptical remarks by european central bank governor jean claude trichet on thursday were the trigger for a big wave of dollar selling and crude oil buying _meta_end_dot_

 this was why oil prices hit _meta_dollor_ref_ on friday _meta_end_dot_

 so what happened next was that fed chairman bernanke piled on last night with a statement that he sees considerably less risk of an economic slowdown but will aggressively meet any signs of increasing inflation in the us _meta_end_dot_

 the whole time that bernanke and his colleagues have been slashing policy interest rates since last september they ve always been very clear that they would reverse quickly if they caught the smell of inflation _meta_end_dot_

 most of us expected rates to stay steady for the rest of this year _meta_end_dot_

 so if there is an early change to tighter monetary policy it s a surprise _meta_end_dot_

 markets have reacted strongly to this decided shift in the regulatory tone _meta_end_dot_

 bond markets are steeply lower this morning the dollar has rallied against both the yen and the euro up from _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ to _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ and crude oil continues its retreat trading this morning around _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 what s missing from the picture is any clarity on whether the fed s economy watchers are actually seeing a return to stronger conditions _meta_end_dot_

 the other possibility is that they re trying to walk back some of the inflationary impact of the extraordinary actions they took in the wake of the bear stearns collapse and the severe money market disruptions that occurred in march and april _meta_end_dot_

 this is a question i d ask bernanke and geithner if given the chance _meta_end_dot_

 if we start moving to higher interest rates while the economy is still weak it could prolong the weakness _meta_end_dot_

 but as i ve said many times this recession is different because it s being driven primarily by weak credit formation _meta_end_dot_

 if we can address this problem which actually is tied in deeply with the housing markets then economic conditions should improve _meta_end_dot_

 watch this space _meta_end_dot_

 i ll update the story as needed _meta_end_dot_

 oh and as an aside here s a question that i don t see anyone in congress asking why is it that prices of crude oil have become so dependent on monetary policy and financial markets _meta_end_question_

 oil is supposed to be an industrial commodity not a financial instrument right _meta_end_question_

 well no that s obviously not all it is _meta_end_dot_

 we do a lot of bloviating about drilling anwr and building more refineries and barack obama keeps chattering like a wind up doll about windfall profits taxes but the influences on oil prices are far more complex than many people appreciate _meta_end_dot_

 and therefore their political impact is too _meta_end_dot_
