  the huckabee campaign no longer makes sense _meta_end_dot_

 huckabee himself no longer makes sense _meta_end_dot_

 the campaign which maybe always has been is certainly now a vanity tool for higher speaking fees for mike huckabee _meta_end_dot_

 today at cpac having had barely any palpable support until today huckabee had a crowd _meta_end_dot_

 they disappeared as promptly as he did _meta_end_dot_

 and they never packed out the room _meta_end_dot_

 had huckabee s campaign been the campaign to stop the mormon from massachusetts mitt romney is gone _meta_end_dot_

 had huckabee s campaign been the campaign to stop the pro abortion cross dresser from new york rudy is gone _meta_end_dot_

 had huckabee s campaign been the campaign to build the wall it would have never made sense because huckabee was never for tough immigration enforcement until this year _meta_end_dot_

 had huckabee s campaign been the campaign to win the presidency it has failed _meta_end_dot_

 it is a mathematical impossibility for him to win _meta_end_dot_

 and yet he hangs on _meta_end_dot_

 he hangs on and claims mccain needs a sparring partner to keep media attention on the republican race _meta_end_dot_

 he hangs on because this campaign has never been about the issues _meta_end_dot_

 it s never been about winning _meta_end_dot_

 it s always been about himself _meta_end_dot_

 he stopped romney and he stopped rudy _meta_end_dot_

 we re now left with a pro life candidate who has held the exact same position as huckabee on immigration until huckabee decided to run for president and who has surrounded himself with better advisors on all issues _meta_end_dot_

 mike huckabee should get out _meta_end_dot_
