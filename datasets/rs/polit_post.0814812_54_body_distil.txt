  via slashdot science so it s a week old president bush signed the genetic non discrimination act into law on the _meta_number_ref_nd _meta_end_dot_

 this bill would prevent the proper assessment of medical risk based on improving medical technology increasing the costs of medical insurance for all americans which of course shows a fundamental misunderstanding of what insurance is _meta_end_dot_

 to be fair though there was only one vote in the house against this bill and none at all in the senate so this silliness extends beyond the presidency and to our entire caucuses in the congress _meta_end_dot_

 read on _meta_end_dot_

 in essence insurance is a gamble _meta_end_dot_

 you the purchaser of insurance are betting that at some point you will get sick lose your house in a flood get in a wreck die prematurely _meta_end_dot_

 the only reason anyone would take such a bet is that the insurance company both gets to set the amount of money you must bet the payoff if you win and conditions in the contract that make it an unfair bet _meta_end_dot_

 so life insurance won t pay off if your death is self inflicted flood insurance can t be purchased in the private market in areas that flood routinely and people with pre existing medical conditions cannot be insured for coverage of those conditions _meta_end_dot_

 to buy insurance on that last point is analogous to betting on the roulette wheel after the wheel was already spun and the ball already fell on its number _meta_end_dot_

 it s not fair to the house and in insurance the insurance provider is the house _meta_end_dot_

 yet rep _meta_end_dot_

 louise slaughter d n y is cheering this and republicans are quietly going along with it the _meta_number_ref_nd did mark a new era of medical care on that i agree _meta_end_dot_

 it marked the day republicans rolled over without a fight on an attack straight at the heart of free market medicine _meta_end_dot_

 our ability to pool risks and pay for medicine privately is endangered if insurance firms cannot account for risks properly by avoiding the sure losses of pre existing conditions _meta_end_dot_

 so when this bill exacerbates the problem and the push for socialized medicine continues let s remember who to thank _meta_end_dot_
