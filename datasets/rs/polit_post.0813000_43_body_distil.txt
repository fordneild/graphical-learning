  poor poor chris matthews _meta_end_dot_

 he is so jealous of rush limbaugh he finally blew it the other day on hardball _meta_end_dot_

 matthews said matthews and his pals at msdnc have for months been shilling for barack obama like a quiznos junior manager in a gorilla outfit in the right of way obviously obnoxiously and with little impact on sales _meta_end_dot_

 for months and months we ve heard matthews describe how he nearly wets himself every time obama sighs and has chills go down his spine and up his leg every time obama speaks _meta_end_dot_

 the whole network save joe scarborough has behaved like dogs in heat for obama _meta_end_dot_

 dan abrams just two weeks ago begged and pleaded for obama to avoid fox news because they might actually ask the candidate substantive questions unlike his network _meta_end_dot_

 olbermann is all obama all the time when he isn t putting limbaugh and redstate on his worst person in the world list a list no one would be shocked to see all of the apostles except judas show up on _meta_end_dot_

 and then there is limbaugh _meta_end_dot_

 after months of msdnc shilling for obama begging people to vote for obama and slanting all their news coverage to favor obama limbaugh just suggests that voters go vote for hillary and they do _meta_end_dot_

 people went out in a coordinated effort to prolong the democratic primary _meta_end_dot_

 what matthews and all of msdnc could not do after months of trying rush limbaugh was able to do get people to the polls in droves _meta_end_dot_

 hell i d be jealous too if i spent months preaching the gospel of obama only to have some guy on freakin radio outdo me in one day _meta_end_dot_

 of course there is more to it than that _meta_end_dot_

 read on _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 chris of course is so blinded by his jealousy of limbaugh that he totally forgets anything and everything about the super delegates _meta_end_dot_

 remember them _meta_end_question_

 they are the people the democrats decided would decide the thing _meta_end_dot_

 and why _meta_end_question_

 because the democrats had so little faith in their own voters they needed a safe guard to make sure their own voters didn t screw up the primary by exercising their right to vote for the wrong candidate _meta_end_dot_

 i think matthews is firing in the wrong direction _meta_end_dot_

 he should be firing on his own side the side that came up with the most screwed up system for determining a political nominee since democracy was first used in greece a few thousand years ago _meta_end_dot_

 chris how would you have people use the vote _meta_end_question_

 again you guys have a system where the vote is actually meaningless _meta_end_dot_

 let s forget about your willingness to write off the votes in michigan and florida didn t people die for those voters to have the right to vote _meta_end_question_

 let s just focus on the super delegates the people who can totally ignore the will of the voters and do whatever the hell they want _meta_end_dot_

 who died for their right chris _meta_end_question_

 oh right the hippie anti american traitors in chicago in _meta_number_ref_ we can t forget about them and the kent state kids _meta_end_dot_

 and i guess the people who stroked out in _meta_number_ref_ when nixon won yeah you all didn t see that one coming _meta_end_dot_

 damn proud chris _meta_end_dot_

 we exposed the arrogance of the system you want to defend the system that is perfectly willing to ignore democratic votes of citizens if those citizens choose the wrong guy _meta_end_dot_

 it also let us drag it out enough so people get a flavor of who you are willing to support a man who hamas is comfortable with a man farc is comfortable with a man who spends twenty years under a preacher of hate who won t take action until the media points it out a man who got his political start in the living room of a terrorist and a man who surrounds himself on a daily basis with people who actively hate this country _meta_end_dot_

 are you proud of yourself chris _meta_end_question_
