  in an ideal world democrats would pass a lot of legislation that bush would either have to sign or veto _meta_end_dot_

 the president would have to take responsibility for his choices _meta_end_dot_

 the house has passed many bills but the republican minority has enormous power in the senate to keep the legislation from ever getting to the president s desk _meta_end_dot_

 this creates the impression that action is being stalled through some vague and nefarious congressional process e j _meta_end_dot_

 dionne december _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 presumably the nefarious congressional process being referred to so snidely is the filibuster _meta_end_dot_

 and if so this is curious _meta_end_dot_

 after all consider the following passage _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 if the principle at stake is majority rule consider that the senate is by its very nature an affront to majoritarian principles _meta_end_dot_

 e j _meta_end_dot_

 dionne march _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ defending the filibuster _meta_end_dot_

 to be sure this latter editorial argues against the nuclear option contemplated against the filibuster while in his most recent article dionne refrains from making nuclear option arguments of his own _meta_end_dot_

 still one cannot help but think that the shoe is very firmly on the other foot _meta_end_dot_
