  reuters tells us this morning that mookie has ordered his goons to stand down _meta_end_dot_

 this news should be blazing around the world this morning maliki is starting to get the hang of this commander in chief thing with a little help from his friends and iraq might actually be headed where president bush and general petraeus and john mccain and others have been telling us they were headed for quite some time now fully self reliant able to maintain security for the iraqi people and capable of attending to their own affairs _meta_end_dot_

 full stop _meta_end_dot_

 then we come across this trash from the la times trying to make the case that this is bad news more below the fold _meta_end_dot_

 first of all the lat s ned parker is under the impression somehow that sadr is a victim in all this _meta_end_dot_

 parker wants us to believe sadr fights because he is not fairly represented in iraq s body politic and has therefore been forced to assert himself with guns and mortars _meta_end_dot_

 what alternate universe does a person need to come from in order to believe it s acceptable to rise up against your democratically elected government by calling for an armed insurrection when votes in parliament don t go your way _meta_end_question_

 apparently parker has forgotten the number of times sadr s people have been ordered to walk out of parliament in protest essentially shutting down many opportunities to resolve matters democratically _meta_end_dot_

 parker also forgets to connect the dots for mookie by reminding him that we might actually have drawn significantly down by now had sadr not blocked sufficient political progress for the us presence to have been reduced to the support role we keep promising as iraqis stand up we will stand down should ring a bell to even the most casual of observers in this mess _meta_end_dot_

 the problem of course is that this does not align too well with the it s all america s fault meme that has kept the times steady on ad revenue and paper sales _meta_end_dot_

 perhaps the times is still in business because they are good at making terrorists look like victims freedom fighters with only the best intentions for their country at heart and a stout hatred of america for good measure this is pathetic on its face and intentionally misleading at its core _meta_end_dot_

 sadr is a terrorist _meta_end_dot_

 those who raise arms against their country or its people through mass killings and kidnappings are traitors and should be hanged _meta_end_dot_

 they certainly should not be glorified as the times does with poor mookie who just had his butt handed to him by the iraqi government check that the duly elected iraqi government _meta_end_dot_

 reading through this presser from a spokesman should make us a little skeptical _meta_end_dot_

 sadr still seeks to hold his weapons get amnesty for his traitorous minions and he appears to be keeping his options open for future opportunities to commit treason _meta_end_dot_

 we have experienced far too many times in recent history that when terrorists surrender and gets to keep their weapons and their freedom they wind up behind women and children blowing themselves up or remotely detonating ieds but i am always optimistic and we should try to be here as well despite parker and the la times wringing their hands to the contrary _meta_end_dot_

 maliki and the iraq government has faced this latest challenge in front of us an british military support and squashed sadr s latest rebellion _meta_end_dot_

 take the good news as it comes and relish it _meta_end_dot_

 the fight for iraq is far from over but this is a good day _meta_end_dot_
