  paul rosenberg obama supporter is mad mad mad _meta_end_exclamation_

 about the way that emily s list clinton supporters candidate and harold ford clinton supporter protege nikki tinker is using a virulently anti semitic flyer against incumbent congressman steve cohen obama super delegate _meta_end_dot_

 as the parentheses might tell you i m not really buying his ostensible motivations for writing this piece _meta_end_dot_

 then again i had already given the typical republican response to this sort of thing appalled disgust back in february see also ed morrissey _meta_end_dot_

 this is in sharp contrast to open left a site that pretty much ignored the problem at the time search terms were steve cohen and steven cohen and only got involved in recently note hit piece against emily s list here _meta_end_dot_

 but hey at least they care now right _meta_end_question_

 even if it s only because of their highly entertaining internal grudge match _meta_end_dot_
