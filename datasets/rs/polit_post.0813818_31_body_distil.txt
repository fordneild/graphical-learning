  jeff covers virtually everything that i would have said about it with one exception _meta_end_dot_

 from the article read on _meta_end_dot_

 the casual contempt that this shows for families with a tradition for military service is all the more jarring for its usual rarity at least its rarity in american political discourse _meta_end_dot_

 while even a half serious student of history would readily grant that many if not most societies had a certain aesthetic distaste for military personnel the united states has not been one of them for a wide variety of reasons _meta_end_dot_

 which is why it s all the more unfortunate that a sitting us senator has decided to make statements akin to those of a chinese mandarin a victorian era fop or indeed an eu professional bureaucrat whose typical sneer would put those of the other two in the shade _meta_end_dot_

 i believe that this is all tied up with that curious custom of declaring someone the other odd for a group that is so ostentatiously against the practice progressives certainly seem fond of doing it themselves _meta_end_dot_

 moe lane ps note that i do not expect an actual apology to follow _meta_end_dot_
