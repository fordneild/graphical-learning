  after three days in a row in which the dow jones industrials average fell by more than _meta_number_ref_ points taking it to a multi year low stocks rallied sharply in new york on tuesday _meta_end_dot_

 meanwhile the dollar rose from just under _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ against the euro to about _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ and crude oil a hedge against dollar inflation fell to about _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 as they smiled over the discomfiture of new york state governor eliot spitzer wall streeters reversed yesterday because of an announcement by the federal reserve an unusual new asset trading facility that it is hoped will stabilize markets for securities backed by mortgages that are not subprime _meta_end_dot_

 you may have read the piece i posted on this subject here on monday morning _meta_end_dot_

 at the fed they evidently read the same tea leaves and decided on a drastic course of action _meta_end_dot_

 more _meta_end_dot_

 as i ve told you many times the most frightening thing about the current state of the financial world is the relative unavailability of credit _meta_end_dot_

 this is the cancer from which flow all the other ills including the weak dollar the high crude oil price and the recession _meta_end_dot_

 the market for securities backed by subprime mortgages has of course been roiled by all kinds of disruptions including forced sales liquidations and bankruptcies _meta_end_dot_

 what started as a liquidity crisis has progressed to a solvency crisis _meta_end_dot_

 but the contagion is now spreading into the market for securities backed by higher quality mortgages as well _meta_end_dot_

 this is the ominous development i wrote about two days ago _meta_end_dot_

 last week the union bank of switzerland dumped _meta_number_ref_ billion swiss francs worth of alt a mortgage backed securities mbs at a rumored _meta_number_ref_ cents on the dollar triggering portfolio revaluations and margin calls all over the world _meta_end_dot_

 but this dynamic is only partially driven by fundamentals _meta_end_dot_

 the default rates on higher quality mortgages including agency owned ones fannie mae and freddie mac are certainly rising as the economy weakens _meta_end_dot_

 but not nearly high enough to trigger massive dumping of securities created by pooling these mortgages together _meta_end_dot_

 what is happening is instead driven by internal market and regulatory dynamics _meta_end_dot_

 think of it as an angry cancer going into metastasis _meta_end_dot_

 the federal reserve has been all over this crisis from the start _meta_end_dot_

 in addition to injecting enormous amounts of temporary liquidity into the banking system they have also sharply reduced policy interest rates _meta_end_dot_

 the fed funds rate now stands at _meta_percent_ref_ and will almost certainly drop again perhaps to _meta_number_ref_ _meta_percent_ref_ next week _meta_end_dot_

 but so far the effects of massive interest rate cuts have all been on the downside _meta_end_dot_

 the rate cuts have done what you would expect them to do they have raised inflation and cut the value of the dollar _meta_end_dot_

 but they have not solved the problem they were meant to address _meta_end_dot_

 interbank lending is still nearly frozen everywhere in the developed world and us treasury debt is the only asset class anyone really wants to own _meta_end_dot_

 that s why businesses and consumers can t access credit and why we re in a worsening recession _meta_end_dot_

 so late on monday night the federal reserve announced a very different kind of policy response a so called term securities lending facility tslf _meta_end_dot_

 they have committed to swap up to _meta_dollor_ref_ billion worth of treasury bonds which are extremely liquid for certain mortgage backed securities for periods up to _meta_number_ref_ days _meta_end_dot_

 their swap partners will be the primary dealers a group of _meta_number_ref_ or so large financial institutions such as merrill lynch abn amro the royal bank of scotland and goldman sachs that are required to bid in us treasury auctions _meta_end_dot_

 sounds pretty arcane _meta_end_dot_

 what does it mean _meta_end_question_

 in effect it means that the fed is providing bids for mortgage backed securities that may otherwise be subject to panic selling _meta_end_dot_

 think of it this way you wouldn t want to lend money not even overnight to anybody that owns a large amount of mortgage backed securities _meta_end_dot_

 but if he owns a lot of us treasury bonds no problem _meta_end_dot_

 the move is intended to unfreeze the interbank lending market and eventually to restore liquidity to the global economy _meta_end_dot_

 in essence the federal reserve is assuming the market risk of the mortgage backed securities it will be accepting in trade for treasury debt from its own portfolio _meta_end_dot_

 is this a bailout _meta_end_question_

 not really because the fed s exposure to the credit risk of the mbs is minimal _meta_end_dot_

 but as the ubs fire sale last week shows the market for mbs is badly stressed _meta_end_dot_

 to the extent that there is a market for them at all it s far below their long term stable value _meta_end_dot_

 the fed is doing just what it s supposed to be doing stepping in and taking actions based on a sober view of reality and giving everyone a chance to take a deep breath and step back from the edge of the abyss _meta_end_dot_

 and one nice feature of the new tslf is that it doesn t increase the monetary base as lower interest rates do _meta_end_dot_

 so it s not inflationary and won t act to reduce the value of the dollar _meta_end_dot_

 also it doesn t have the market distorting effect of actually setting prices for mbs _meta_end_dot_

 this would have been the case had the fed simply started buying mbs on the open market as many people have recommended _meta_end_dot_

 initial reaction to the announcement was good _meta_end_dot_

 in addition to the stock and dollar rallies the spread between fannie mae s _meta_number_ref_ year bonds and the _meta_number_ref_ year t note fell about twenty basis points yesterday _meta_end_dot_

 there still is a long way to go down from here _meta_end_dot_

 the strain caused by the end of the us housing bubble still has to work itself out _meta_end_dot_

 the hope is that we won t have a financial meltdown in the process _meta_end_dot_

 that s what the fed is trying to avoid _meta_end_dot_

 we ll see how it goes _meta_end_dot_

 stock markets in asia and europe rose overnight but the dollar is trading lower in london this morning off its highs reached yesterday _meta_end_dot_

 crude oil is somewhat higher this morning gold is unchanged _meta_end_dot_

 this reflects skepticism that the tslf will reduce the pressure on the fed to cut interest rates further _meta_end_dot_

 after all what started as a financial crisis has become a recession and they still need to worry about that _meta_end_dot_
