  do you think mccain looked angry or on fire _meta_end_question_

 did romney shine under fire or look like a deer in headlights _meta_end_question_

 is rudy still there _meta_end_question_

 can fred win over anyone who doesn t already like his style _meta_end_question_

 well here is my way of analyzing this debate _meta_end_dot_

 this is a new hampshire debate and the proper lens to analyze is how will this affect the nh race overall i don t think this debate changes much _meta_end_dot_

 there was not much learned that wasn t already known _meta_end_dot_

 most importantly when discussing nh the discussion comes down to how mccain and romney did _meta_end_dot_

 in my opinion romney handled the tough attacks as well as he could _meta_end_dot_

 nevertheless the main story line will be that the rest of the field smells blood is ganging up on him and landing punches on his flip flops and negativity _meta_end_dot_

 it was only a matter of time before his changing positions and relentless negative ads were going to come up _meta_end_dot_

 tonight they did _meta_end_dot_

 i don t think he loses any supporters in nh but i don t see him gaining much from this performance either _meta_end_dot_

 mccain had a similar neutral performance _meta_end_dot_

 he did not take many attacks from the other candidates _meta_end_dot_

 the give and take with romney on immigration was the best debating this cycle but it didn t really reveal anything new to over saturated nh voters _meta_end_dot_

 mccain s barbs at romney got a bit excessive but it won t likely lose him any current supporters _meta_end_dot_

 with immigration and global warming as topics mccain reminded conservatives of some sore spots _meta_end_dot_

 but nh republicans are not alabama republicans _meta_end_dot_

 i don t see mccain losing any support after this performance and it s possible his appeal to independents was helped a little _meta_end_dot_

 fred was great on substance but i don t see this likely vaulting him up from his _meta_number_ref_ _meta_percent_ref_ current showing in nh _meta_end_dot_

 giuliani did well as usual but also not well enough to break away from the rest into _meta_number_ref_rd _meta_end_dot_

 ditto huck _meta_end_dot_

 all that said this was the best debate so far in this political cycle _meta_end_dot_

 kudos to abc for allowing the back and forth but keeping people on topic _meta_end_dot_

 well done _meta_end_dot_
