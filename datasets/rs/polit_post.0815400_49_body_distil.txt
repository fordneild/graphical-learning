  first off a confession yes that was my cousin hillary just thanked from the podium _meta_end_dot_

 i trust he is as ashamed of my political preferences as i of him but we re nice about it and can drink together anyway _meta_end_dot_

 this is family people _meta_end_dot_

 second off who were all these self styled experts about puerto rican politics who emerged over the past few weeks _meta_end_question_

 i can t tell you how many glaring factually vacant idiocies i saw in ink form and online over the past few weeks all because someone has a puerto rican friend or vacationed on the island a few times _meta_end_dot_

 look just because you ve been to a place doesn t mean you understand its politics _meta_end_dot_

 the rest of the rs editors always dog on me for linking to this publication but i still persist in reading it because i like it and i like npr sue me which led me to ask who the heck is michael sean winters and why is he so wrong about puerto rico _meta_end_question_

 i d assume a jesuit to at least know enough to realize that the selection of presidente over medalla is not going to decide an election look i love pr but medalla tastes like it s aged in sweaty socks _meta_end_dot_

 but then he got the king canute reference wrong too so whaddaya expect _meta_end_dot_

 in any case the third and most important point is this puerto rico may not matter at the moment or in the big scheme of things but it should to any democrat _meta_end_dot_

 it should because it shows once again that given the opportunity to ice this nomination for good barack obama cannot deliver _meta_end_dot_

 his ground efforts are simply not up to snuff for a general election and it will need a vast overhaul to compete with a republican machine that for all its faults still is at the top of the game when it comes to microtargeting voters and moving people on election day _meta_end_dot_
