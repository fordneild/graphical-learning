  i spent some time entering data on head to head matchups at the state level from susa _meta_end_dot_

 the compiled data can be seen in this spreadsheet _meta_end_dot_

 if you look at the spreadsheet this guide will help your interpretation _meta_end_dot_

 the first page is the data input the second compares one rep to another against the same dem the third looks at the shift in support for the rep if obama wins the dem nomination instead of hillary and the fourth is an electoral vote analysis of the _meta_number_ref_ states covered _meta_end_dot_

 note there was insufficient data on thompson to include him so i m left with mccain rudy romney and huck _meta_end_dot_

 before the data analysis i must say that these polls show a strong advantage for the democrats _meta_end_dot_

 the democrats are competitive in states that are considered red and have comfortable leads in purple states _meta_end_dot_

 the only exception to this pattern is when mccain is the republican nominee _meta_end_dot_

 that being said here are the results of this exercise _meta_end_dot_

 i ve come to _meta_number_ref_ major conclusions _meta_number_ref_ overall the rs do better against obama not hillary in most states _meta_end_dot_

 this seems surprising since hillary is supposedly so divisive _meta_end_dot_

 but hillary leads or ties romney in all the states i looked at including ks al ia and va and leads or ties huckabee in all states except mo and al _meta_end_dot_

 both do better against obama _meta_end_dot_

 rudy and mccain do well against obama with mccain leading obama in ma mn and wa all kerry states _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ mccain polls strongest against both ds by a significant margin followed by rudy _meta_end_dot_

 romney and huck are both behind the top _meta_number_ref_ and even with one another _meta_end_dot_

 mccain does much much better in oh ky mn wi ma or and va than the other republicans _meta_end_dot_

 he does better than romney in all states against hillary or obama _meta_end_dot_

 he does better than huck in every state against both hillary and obama except huck does _meta_number_ref_ points better against clinton in mo _meta_end_dot_

 mccain does better than rudy in _meta_number_ref_ of _meta_number_ref_ states against hillary and _meta_number_ref_ of _meta_number_ref_ states against obama _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ obama does much better in ia than other states _meta_end_dot_

 clinton is more competitive than obama in almost all of the states _meta_end_dot_

 but in ia where obama has spent time he does better against all _meta_number_ref_ rs than clinton does _meta_end_dot_

 he shifts ia by _meta_number_ref_ points against mccain _meta_number_ref_ rudy _meta_number_ref_ romney and _meta_number_ref_ huck _meta_end_dot_

 it should be noted that the d leads the r in ia in every matchup except mccain leads hillary by _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 more ev analysis below looking for a bottom line here s as good as i can give you _meta_end_dot_

 the data covers the following swing states oh mo wi mn ia nm or and va _meta_end_dot_

 the non swing states covered are ca ny ky al ks ma and wa _meta_end_dot_

 there is some fl data but not for all candidates so it is not included here _meta_end_dot_

 the swing states have _meta_number_ref_ total electoral votes _meta_end_dot_

 here is the head to head results of those _meta_number_ref_ evs_meta_beep_ref_ mccain _meta_number_ref_ mccain _meta_number_ref_ giuliani _meta_number_ref_ clinton _meta_number_ref_ giuliani _meta_number_ref_ romney _meta_number_ref_ clinton _meta_number_ref_ romney _meta_number_ref_ obama _meta_number_ref_ huck _meta_number_ref_ clinton _meta_number_ref_ huck _meta_number_ref_ obama _meta_number_ref_ note _meta_number_ref_ ties make some numbers add up to less than _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 specifically obama mccain in or obama rudy in ny obama rudy in mn and clinton rudy in va _meta_end_dot_
