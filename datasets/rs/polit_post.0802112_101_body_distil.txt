  promoted from blogs with a tag added _meta_end_dot_

 moe lane a recent post at conservablogs com concerned a regular conservablogs contributor nuke gingrich and a friend of his who was so distraught with nuke s support of mike huckabee he ended their friendship _meta_end_dot_

 he took down his link to nuke s blog and it appears he ll have nothing to do with nuke any longer _meta_end_dot_

 nuke quotes his friend nuke adds there are two goals people work for in a primary _meta_end_dot_

 the first is to nominate someone who best represents them their values and their ideology _meta_end_dot_

 the second is nominating someone to stop the opposition candidate who is presumed to have values and ideologies antithetical to theirs _meta_end_dot_

 common sense ought to tell us the candidate able to do one thing may not be the candidate able to do the other _meta_end_dot_

 the situation for candidates to avoid is being so polarizing during the primary you alienate those with differing views in the general election _meta_end_dot_

 whoever wins the primary must be able to bring supporters of his primary opponents together and unite them behind him _meta_end_dot_

 this lead a horse to water factor so agonizingly demonstrated for us by nuke s friend is critical as the primary process not only has two goals it assumes two things _meta_end_dot_

 the first is that candidates defeated in the primary will graciously support the nominee _meta_end_dot_

 the second is that supporters of candidates defeated in the primary will do likewise _meta_end_dot_

 at the end of the day what does a voter do if his candidate isn t nominated _meta_end_question_

 what happens if voters won t honor the agreement implicit in the process and rally behind the nominee even if and especially if he s not their choice _meta_end_question_

 there s really only one option left to voters who won t stay home _meta_end_dot_

 the impracticality of encouraging and enabling an entire nation of disappointed and discouraged voters to write in their candidate makes that merely a low percentage option as opposed to any sort of realistic probability _meta_end_dot_

 opting out of the process is the only serious option available _meta_end_dot_

 it also violates the second goal and the second assumption of the primary process _meta_end_dot_

 truthfully i ve always been both skeptical of and a wee bit disgusted with the primary process _meta_end_dot_

 it s a scheme whereby one candidate spends months savaging the others _meta_end_dot_

 he sincerely declares across the country and in the media what a disaster it would be if his opponents were elected _meta_end_dot_

 later when one emerges victorious from the pack the nominee is proclaimed as the savior of the country by the very people who a week earlier seriously argued the nominee s policies would destroy us all _meta_end_dot_

 it makes us look ridiculous _meta_end_dot_

 gone is the passion directed against his primary opponent _meta_end_dot_

 he was just mistaken before _meta_end_dot_

 it s not his good friend s policies that are dangerous it s the other party s nominee that is the devil incarnate and whose policies are disastrous _meta_end_dot_

 his final act is to beseech his supporters to give the same level of support and devotion to the new guy _meta_end_dot_

 it makes one wonder what if anything we truly believe _meta_end_question_

 perhaps the passion of nuke s friend is a better position to take _meta_end_dot_

 it s surely a prime necessity to win the fight for the nomination of someone who best represents us as an individual _meta_end_dot_

 but it also reveals the ultimate danger we face in the primary process allowing it to divide us _meta_end_dot_

 beyond the search for someone to represent us as an individual the primary also determines which candidate we unite behind as a group _meta_end_dot_

 as hard as it is to say and hear that group is called a party _meta_end_dot_

 and it s a party primary more than it is an individual primary _meta_end_dot_

 if party choices revealed in the primary process are offensive the only option with integrity is to leave the party entirely and avoid the conflict altogether _meta_end_dot_

 if you stay in the party however you implicitly buy into the process as it exists _meta_end_dot_

 primaries are not either or situations where we either support this candidate or we fracture and separate _meta_end_dot_

 they are a both and dynamic where we both commit to fight for all we are worth for our candidate and commit to support whoever comes out on top even if it s not our guy _meta_end_dot_

 for all his valuable and desirable passion nuke s friend misses that point _meta_end_dot_

 badly _meta_end_dot_

 thinking he also misses the truth of the maxim the enemy of my enemy is my friend _meta_end_dot_
