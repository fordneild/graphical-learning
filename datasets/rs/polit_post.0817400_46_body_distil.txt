  apparently that party unity on the democratic side is going to be a little harder to achieve than some thought it would be between this and the patti solis doyle hire earlier this week hillary supporters have been given a fair number of things to be mad about _meta_end_dot_

 having beaten the clintons and their supporters obama is now causing many of those supporters to believe that he has contempt for the clintons and for the campaign that they ran _meta_end_dot_

 any more such efforts at party unity and we might have ourselves a full blown schism before september even hits _meta_end_dot_
