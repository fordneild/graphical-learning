  the point of this article should not be that the clinton campaign misrepresented and dramatized a story in order to gain tears sympathy and votes on the campaign trail _meta_end_dot_

 the point should be that when stories meant to pull at the heartstrings of voters and the media are referenced over and over on the campaign trail it behooves the media to ask two questions with regard to hillary clinton s stump story those questions was not asked until relatively late in the game _meta_end_dot_

 and thus far they haven t been asked about other hard luck stump stories told by the clinton campaign or by other candidates _meta_end_dot_

 i won t be in the least bit surprised if a number of barack obama s stories for sympathy end up being factually inaccurate _meta_end_dot_

 of course a number of them will be true as well we do not yet live in utopia _meta_end_dot_

 but there is a clear and distinct tendency on the part of the media to tell us every election cycle that life is just awful for ordinary folks _meta_end_dot_

 and as we know the truth is quite different _meta_end_dot_

 we are likely in a recession _meta_end_dot_

 life could be better _meta_end_dot_

 but life is still astonishingly good when you consider the entire picture _meta_end_dot_

 i don t want candidates for the presidency to be pollyannish _meta_end_dot_

 but to be realistic candidates for the presidency ought to appreciate and acknowledge much more than they actually do that they live in a society where miracles are par for the course _meta_end_dot_
