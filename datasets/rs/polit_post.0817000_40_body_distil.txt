  from michael goldfarb we learn an astounding fact john kerry supports granting habeas corpus rights to osama bin laden _meta_end_dot_

 from the ny observer obama himself of course already made the mistake of suggesting that granting habeas rights are just following the example of nuremberg where no such rights existed _meta_end_dot_

 conservatives would emphatically support obama s position if it means as potus he would hold to the nuremberg standard for international tribunals since this measure would grant far fewer allowances for terrorists on trial than any court arranged by the current administration _meta_end_dot_

 and it s not like nuremberg was just a slaughterhouse they acquitted more than one individual they just weren t as interested in giving a whole slew of known killers and villains undeserved rights _meta_end_dot_

 imagine if nuremberg had the kind of allowances and presumptions of today s american courts _meta_end_question_

 we d have been arguing about these nazis til the reagan presidency _meta_end_dot_

 it is a simple straightforward and reasonable position known terrorists who have done nothing to earn the rights of american citizens but prove that they have varying degrees of skill in killing american citizens should not have the same court experience as american citizens _meta_end_dot_

 the american people agree emphatically rejecting the obama kerry position in the abc news wapo poll released today even on a question that convoluted people have no qualms access to the civilian court system is not a universal right but a right that terrorists do not deserve _meta_end_dot_

 if caught alive osama bin laden should be tried and executed _meta_end_dot_

 he should not be granted rights he has no claim to by birthright or service or any other measure _meta_end_dot_

 barack obama must answer this question why does osama bin laden deserve these rights _meta_end_question_
