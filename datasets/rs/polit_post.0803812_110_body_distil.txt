  the race for the democratic presidential nomination has changed quite a bit hasn t it _meta_end_question_

 the cult of obama will get a kick out of this _meta_end_dot_

 for the record i don t think that there is a cult of obama just people who really really like him _meta_end_dot_

 and why not _meta_end_question_

 he may be the liberal reagan and if i were a liberal i would want a liberal reagan too of course one wonders if the following words were kept in mind by the clinton campaign when it decided to take a loan from its own candidate the clintons are looking to march to save them but if february becomes all about the juggernaut the obama campaign has become march may do nothing to save them _meta_end_dot_

 still it remains a significant possibility that neither clinton nor obama will be able to go to the democratic national convention with enough delegates to get the nomination on the first ballot _meta_end_dot_

 this makes howard dean nervous and excitable and we all know what happens when howard dean gets nervous and excitable _meta_end_dot_
