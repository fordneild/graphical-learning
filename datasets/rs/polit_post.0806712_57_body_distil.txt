  that says the washington post s fifth column of one dana milbank is the theme of the new and reinvigorated hillary _meta_end_exclamation_

 campaign _meta_end_dot_

 i ve watched a few presidential primaries play out but i have to say this is the first one in which i ve heard one candidate unfavorably compare their primary opponent s qualifications to those of their general election opponent _meta_end_dot_

 it is a counterintuitive strategy at least on the part of hillary _meta_end_exclamation_

 _meta_end_dot_

 her experience at handling those _meta_number_ref_am calls would seem to be no more profound than those of any of the other slew of women who found themselves in bill clinton s bed at that hour of the morning _meta_end_dot_

 personally i don t find hillary s r sum to be any more stellar than that of barack obama and in the area of national security the salient difference between the two is that obama has studiously chosen to avoid difficult votes or even holding difficult hearings before his subcommittee while hillary s votes all reek of cynical opportunism _meta_end_dot_

 i m not convinced that either upon receiving that _meta_number_ref_am call will do much more than roll over and show their belly _meta_end_dot_

 again dana milbank bingo _meta_end_dot_

 pass the popcorn and while you re up can you get me another red stripe _meta_end_question_
