  the only enjoyable aspect of this valuable column by ron fournier is that it reminded me of the days of my youth days when i didn t need glasses and did need to have a comb in my pocket _meta_end_dot_

 otherwise _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 dear lord is this what we have in store for the next four perhaps eight years _meta_end_question_

 another presidential candidate _meta_end_dot_

 especially when that other presidential candidate happens to be his wife _meta_end_dot_

 one naturally sympathizes with senator clinton who has to be wondering what precisely she has to do in order to get top billing in her husband s speeches nowadays _meta_end_dot_

 there is more below _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 an excellent catch by fournier who is to be commended for the tenacity with which he keeps the truth securely in his jaws _meta_end_dot_

 and as for the claim that the former president opposed the iraq war from the beginning let s go to the tape of course the spin machine is out in full force not that their words mitigate the damning from the clintonian perspective excerpt above opposed the war but kept quiet to support his successor _meta_end_dot_

 who believes this especially given the fact that governor clinton said of operation desert storm in _meta_number_ref_ that if he were in congress he would have voted with the majority though he agreed with the arguments that the minority made _meta_end_question_

 and again the excerpt above makes clear that the former president gave public support if qualified for the iraq war _meta_end_dot_

 going back and saying that he was opposed from the beginning but just wanted to be nice and help his successor out is more than a bit disingenuous as fournier points out _meta_end_dot_

 and just out of curiosity are we supposed to believe what the former president is saying now or what he said in the excerpt above _meta_end_question_

 see how tricky all of this can get _meta_end_question_

 back to fournier we have been over this ground _meta_end_dot_

 next _meta_end_question_

 can t really argue with that _meta_end_dot_

 though i am sure that at a later campaign event the former president may try to _meta_end_dot_
