  either nancy pelosi doesn t understand the nature of the u s colombia trade deal or she thinks that she can fool the public _meta_end_dot_

 in any event she makes a hash of things in trying to explain why she allowed for fast track authority to expire thus putting the deal on the back burner but of course there are a lot of myths associated with the rejection of the trade agreement _meta_end_dot_

 and concerns about american workers and the environment are pavlovian and come about with the advent of any trade deal the facts notwithstanding _meta_end_dot_

 robert zoellick was right and while i hate to say that i told you so i did _meta_end_dot_
