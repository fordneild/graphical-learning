  maybe i m late to the endorsement game as many of the other contributors and redstaters have already chimed in _meta_end_dot_

 i have always been more sympathetic to sen _meta_end_dot_

 mccain than other people at redstate _meta_end_dot_

 but for various reasons i don t make a decision until late in the game _meta_end_dot_

 i considered mayor giuliani and sen _meta_end_dot_

 thompson and was ready to support them at different points this year _meta_end_dot_

 but after a full reflection i have concluded that sen _meta_end_dot_

 mccain is the right man in the right place at the right time _meta_end_dot_

 i am proud to join charles bird sen _meta_end_dot_

 brownback gov _meta_end_dot_

 pawlenty sen _meta_end_dot_

 graham sen _meta_end_dot_

 lieberman henry kissinger phil gramm sen _meta_end_dot_

 jon kyl rep _meta_end_dot_

 shadegg gov _meta_end_dot_

 keating and over _meta_number_ref_ generals and admirals in endorsing sen _meta_end_dot_

 mccain for president _meta_end_dot_

 read on _meta_end_dot_

 i leaned toward supporting sen _meta_end_dot_

 mccain over sen _meta_end_dot_

 thompson before i had the opportunity to ride the straight talk express last month _meta_end_dot_

 if i listed my views on each issue and compared them to the major candidates sen _meta_end_dot_

 thompson would probably line up as the best match _meta_end_dot_

 however issues alone are not determinative of my support _meta_end_dot_

 sen _meta_end_dot_

 mccain has the experience knowledge and ability to reach beyond the bush clinton partisan divide that has characterized our politics for _meta_number_ref_ years _meta_end_dot_

 sen _meta_end_dot_

 mccain s foreign policy and military knowledge and experience are needed in a post _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ world _meta_end_dot_

 his deep understanding of military affairs his early support for the surge his commitment to fighting the war on terror and his ability to persuade our fellow americans that this is a war worth fighting are assets that cannot be overlooked in today s world and political environment _meta_end_dot_

 sen _meta_end_dot_

 mccain s deep knowledge of the challenges facing the country including the pending bankruptcy of social security the horrendous embrace of pork barreling by both parties and the international challenges in the post cold war world is unmatched by the other candidates in both the primary and general election _meta_end_dot_

 sen _meta_end_dot_

 mccain recognizes that the country distrusts and dislikes congress and the government _meta_end_dot_

 he understands better than other candidates that the distrust is due to the politicians embrace of self serving pork barreling and the use of a partisan lens on every major issue that must be addressed _meta_end_dot_

 sen _meta_end_dot_

 mccain learned about this distrust in his handling of the illegal immigration question in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 he correctly realized that people do not trust the government when it says we ll secure the border and set up a guest worker program so he is committed to winning back the trust of the people by securing the border by working to address the major issues addressing the country and by shutting down the pork barreling corruption in washington _meta_end_dot_

 although some republicans may not want to hear it sen _meta_end_dot_

 mccain s ability to work with democrats is a benefit to him and the country _meta_end_dot_

 in a political environment where partisanship has led to abysmal approval ratings for both parties congress and the president the proven ability to work across party lines will help win non partisan voters and accomplish more reforms once in office _meta_end_dot_

 in an environment where republicans are less popular than any time since before reagan s ascent sen _meta_end_dot_

 mccain is the best suited to reach out to voters who have left the republican party over the increasing bush clinton partisan approach to politics _meta_end_dot_

 and even if republicans are lucky enough to win the presidency next year congress will almost assuredly be in democratic hands _meta_end_dot_

 thus any major reforms military actions or other government action will have to be bipartisan _meta_end_dot_

 the country doesn t want two or four more years of the grid lock partisan setup that reid pelosi bush and delay have pursued in recent years _meta_end_dot_

 finally against sen _meta_end_dot_

 clinton sen _meta_end_dot_

 obama or sen _meta_end_dot_

 edwards mccain is not only the most electable but the best match up for republicans _meta_end_dot_

 mccain is conservative enough on most issues to pick up _meta_number_ref__meta_beep_ref_ of republican votes but he is also the most popular politician among independents _meta_end_dot_

 against clinton mccain is the best positioned to run as the change candidate _meta_end_dot_

 the clinton bush era is not popular among independents and mccain s maverick reputation will make him the choice of the majority of independents despite the current distrust of republicans among most independents _meta_end_dot_

 against obama mccain is the only republicans who can neutralize the media created image of unifier despite the fact that obama has down the line leftist views the media has built on his rhetoric to make him the unifier of the country _meta_end_dot_

 mccain can neutralize that strength and will make obama look so unprepared to be president that swing voters would be taking a big risk sending such an unqualified man to the white house _meta_end_dot_

 most importantly a president mccain would begin a new era of presidential politics _meta_end_dot_

 he would not be the head of the gop the way bush is _meta_end_dot_

 he would be a president for the whole country _meta_end_dot_

 at times this will strike a nerve with conservatives who will want mccain to be their president the way bush has been but for the country it would be good to have a less partisan president _meta_end_dot_

 and in a year where the democrats have a _meta_number_ref_ _meta_percent_ref_ chance of winning the presidency sen _meta_end_dot_

 mccain is likely the best chance for republicans to avoid a democratic sweep of the house senate and presidency in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 i support sen _meta_end_dot_

 mccain for president in _meta_number_ref_ and i hope you will consider supporting him as well _meta_end_dot_

 two extra notes _meta_number_ref_ i will put any pro mccain pieces in the diary after this but my race analysis pieces will stay on the front page _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ i am happy to answer any questions or explain my support for the senator _meta_end_dot_

 but unlike many i won t be trashing other candidates _meta_end_dot_

 i could support any of the major rs in the general election and i especially like sen _meta_end_dot_

 thompson on the issues _meta_end_dot_

 he just doesn t have that undefinable something that makes sen _meta_end_dot_

 mccain presidential _meta_end_dot_

 i think it s a mix of experience knowledge and straight talk but sen _meta_end_dot_

 mccain has something that sen _meta_end_dot_

 thompson lacks _meta_end_dot_
