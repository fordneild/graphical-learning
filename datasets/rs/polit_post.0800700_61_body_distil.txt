  yes there is another debate on at _meta_number_ref_ p m _meta_end_dot_

 tonight _meta_end_dot_

 and it looks like the thompson campaign is doing some anticipatory framing of the debate _meta_end_dot_

 as larry kudlow recently pointed out thompson is the only candidate to really get into the details on entitlement reform and now thompson is going further on immigration _meta_end_dot_

 he s set up what for him amnesty means _meta_end_dot_

 that s important because at last night s debate mccain and romney bickered over what was or was not amnesty _meta_end_dot_

 thompson intervened to offer up a definition and he s been pushing it again today _meta_end_dot_

 a lot of people say he and mccain are a lot alike _meta_end_dot_

 this issue clearly divides the two candidates and thompson is going to fight on his definition a definition that i suspect most folks in south carolina will embrace as their own pretty clear to me _meta_end_dot_
