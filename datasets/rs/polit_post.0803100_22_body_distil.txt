  it comes to this john mccain and mitt romney _meta_end_dot_

 rudy s out and huckabee is finished but will likely stay in the race as long as there is a race to stay in _meta_end_dot_

 more on them at another time for we republicans have a decision to make and an important one fall in behind the newly cemented frontrunner john mccain or stage a last chance rearguard action behind mitt romney _meta_end_dot_

 i m sure i will not surprise anyone who has been reading my writings on this race these last few months when i say that i am supporting mccain and hoping that the party gets behind him quickly when and if as seems likely he sweeps a number of large states on super duper tuesday six days from now _meta_end_dot_

 as i previously explained at some length i am like martin under no illusions about the nature of a mccain presidency which would undoubtedly lead to a lot of bad consequences for conservatives on a whole range of issues and would almost certainly lead a divided and demoralized party to a bloody and potentially disastrous schism by _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 i m not going to sell you on mccain s specific policies other than to point out the obvious which is that he would be far better on the war the courts taxes spending and entitlements than hillary or should the improbable happen obama _meta_end_dot_

 i may return another day to what i think mccain could accomplish in office specifically the hope i had in supporting him _meta_number_ref_ years ago that he may yet be the man who can actually do something about the entitlements crisis i would also remind mccain s critics that the man cast tough votes to put robert bork clarence thomas and samuel alito on the supreme court and to oppose bush s expansion of medicare to cover prescription drugs _meta_end_dot_

 but as ben has set out brilliantly this election is so important at such a critical juncture that i am willing to make that deal to win it and i believe with all my heart that mccain can win this race and mitt romney cannot _meta_end_dot_

 i will address below three main points _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 why i think mccain can win and specifically why i think analogies to john kerry and bob dole are misguided _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 why i think romney can t win and would be a bad candidate to lose with _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 why we need the primaries wrapped up quickly now that we are down to a more traditional two man race _meta_end_dot_

 read on _meta_end_dot_

 i _meta_end_dot_

 mccain can win _meta_end_dot_

 as adam has noted mccain has now vaulted ahead of hillary and obama in head to head polls _meta_end_dot_

 i don t pay a ton of attention to such polls this early before a nominee has been settled on and that undoubtedly reflects the wave of good press for mccain as he gathers momentum as well as the wave of bad press emanating from the nasty racially divisive hillary obama race _meta_end_dot_

 still it s a reminder that mccain can reach people in the general electorate at a time when the gop is at something of a low ebb and that s worth keeping in mind when discussing how _meta_end_dot_

 a _meta_end_dot_

 the silver lining in mccain s moderation i have emphasized for a reason that ideas don t run for president people do _meta_end_dot_

 sure some voters vote on issues and candidates handling of the issues also tells us things about their personality and philosophy and values that form a more general impression for the voters _meta_end_dot_

 e g i voted for it before i voted against it _meta_end_dot_

 but the majority of voters are to be reached fundamentally by a sense of whether or not they like and trust the candidate and the general impression they have of what the candidate stands for _meta_end_dot_

 mccain s defining feature is still his sense of personal honor duty and patriotic service and those are not characteristics to sneeze at they will play well on the trail _meta_end_dot_

 he is still the man who could say with seriousness and dignity as he did when casting an unpopular vote to remove hillary s husband from office step back from the many detailed disputes we conservatives have with mccain and you can see why a lot of republicans are fine voting for mccain but also why a lot of independents and moderate democrats are too _meta_end_dot_

 from a distance the public image of mccain is indeed a guy who is conservative on core issues a foreign policy hawk who made supporting the iraq war his signature issue a fighter against wasteful government spending a man who opposes tax hikes and abortion supported conservative judges and even fought against president bush on expanding medicare _meta_end_dot_

 yet it s also an image that sands down what a lot of moderates see as the rough edges of conservatism on the environment torture immigration and a variety of beltway scandal type issues _meta_end_dot_

 fairly or not that picture is an appealing one to the general public especially when combined with mccain s own war hero status _meta_end_dot_

 spend some time talking to non political people and non republicans about mccain and romney and i guarantee you they will have a much greater openness to mccain than to romney _meta_end_dot_

 that matters a lot _meta_end_dot_

 recalling that president bush s approval ratings remain terrible though not as bad as those of the wimpy defeatist congressional democrats from whom mccain is also easily distinguishable consider jay cost s analysis of the florida exit polls add in mccain s personality more on this later and you can see why he presents a particularly formidable general election candidate especially when matched against hillary who i regard now once again as almost certain to win her party s nomination by whatever means necessary _meta_end_dot_

 b _meta_end_dot_

 he s not kerry or dole critics of the electability argument often point to the democrats _meta_number_ref_ nomination of john kerry a nomination of a senator and putative war hero made with both eyes on electability as a cautionary tale _meta_end_dot_

 critics of mccain often point to bob dole another senator and war hero as a parallel for why mccain would be a weak candidate _meta_end_dot_

 there are indeed some similarities all three senators were settled on without being really the top choice of almost anyone in their party and mccain like kerry went from frontrunner to dead and buried in the summer and fall to suddenly revived at the last minute but like kerry s beloved vietnam iraq parallels the differences are just as important _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 mccain s actually a good candidate _meta_end_dot_

 kerry was in a bunch of obvious ways see here and here a crummy candidate and had democrats listened to us republicans who had watched the man at any length they would have realized that _meta_end_dot_

 the fact that democrats thought he was electable just proved how blinkered they were for example overlooking a huge vulnerability the longstanding animosity of vietnam vets towards kerry s behavior after returning from vietnam in the early _meta_number_ref_s and mistaking kerry s war record for actual credibility on national security _meta_end_dot_

 an added bonus is that kerry s war record failed to impress many of his fellow veterans which is plainly not true of mccain _meta_end_dot_

 a number of the swift boat veterans for truth knew mccain from being pows and support him now _meta_end_dot_

 dole burned by the coverage of his acid tongue in _meta_number_ref_ and his temper in _meta_number_ref_ was overly cautious on the trail and struck people as too old compared to the vigorous glamorous bill clinton _meta_end_dot_

 by contrast mccain despite his age is fast on his feet and charming in his own brusque short fused way and is unafraid to basically be himself _meta_end_dot_

 in hillary moreover he is likely to face an adversary who is herself not the picture of youth and is about as un charismatic as you could be _meta_end_dot_

 mccain s age worried me a lot more a year ago before watching him on the trail _meta_end_dot_

 obama who could easily be mccain s son age wise has seemed exhausted and grouchy more often than mccain _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 mccain s not running against an incumbent _meta_end_dot_

 this ought to be an obvious point but it gets missed a lot _meta_end_dot_

 kerry for all his problems did not do so badly at the end of the day for a candidate running against an incumbent in wartime with a strong economy and a united party at his back _meta_end_dot_

 despite the palpable lack of enthusiasm for kerry in his own party you could not argue as with al gore that the man lost because he failed to get his own supporters to show up and vote _meta_end_dot_

 he lost because the incumbent had a great turnout of his own and won over many people who didn t vote for him four years earlier _meta_end_dot_

 the same is true to a lesser extent of the clinton dole race clinton was a popular incumbent there was never any doubt that democrats would be united behind him he was able to start pounding dole with tv ads in mid _meta_number_ref_ whereas hillary is still tied up with obama _meta_end_dot_

 the fact that kerry and dole lost to incumbents says little enough about mccain _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 mccain is just fine with moderates _meta_end_dot_

 this is related to the points i made above kerry was the very caricature of a massachusetts liberal so it should not have surprised anyone that the general electorate would view him as less electable than the democratic primary electorate _meta_end_dot_

 mccain s problem is with conservative republicans not swing voters _meta_end_dot_

 and conservatives by and large will come out to vote against hillary for the same reasons the lefties came out against bush in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 the contrast between mccain s bipartisan maverick cred and hillary s deep bitter divisiveness is a perfect recipe for a mccain victory _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 there s a war on _meta_end_dot_

 dole s war hero status long experience in washington and general foreign policy credibility didn t count for much in _meta_number_ref_ because national security wasn t a major issue in that campaign _meta_end_dot_

 in _meta_number_ref_ it s unavoidable _meta_end_dot_

 ii _meta_end_dot_

 what s the point of losing with romney _meta_end_question_

 i have explained at enormous length previously see here and go back to the prior _meta_number_ref_ installments as well as here here and here for more recent specific issues why i think romney unlike mccain is a weak and ultimately unelectable general election candidate as well as less reliable as a commander in chief than mccain gamecock no mccain fan summarizes the latter point here _meta_end_dot_

 and let s not forget priceless moments on the trail like this one as well as ben s analysis _meta_end_dot_

 let s just review a couple of items here to sum up _meta_end_dot_

 a _meta_end_dot_

 no hablo espanol first check the exit polls mccain beat romney _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ among latino voters with mitt trailing rudy by _meta_number_ref_ points in that demographic as well _meta_end_dot_

 even recognizing that florida s latinos are dominated by cuban americans who may have their own reasons for preferring mccain this is a very important demographic group and a growing one in critical states _meta_end_dot_

 gop support among latinos grew under bush and has plummeted in the past two years undoubtedly due at least in part to the number of latinos who view hardline rhetoric on immigration with distaste or even fear _meta_end_dot_

 like it or not the gop cannot be competitive in the short or the long term if latino voters become as solidly democratic as african americans are _meta_end_dot_

 mccain s record on immigration is too far to the left for my taste but it s bound to burn fewer bridges than romney s approach _meta_end_dot_

 it s not just that romney s an immigration hardliner but that he really plays into every negative stereotype of the immigration hardline politician an opportunist and panderer who only jumped on this issue when he ran for president a man born to wealth who wants to crack down on the very people who mow his lawn _meta_end_dot_

 true romney would appeal to the tiny though growing slice of the population that is both latino and mormon _meta_end_dot_

 and true much of that is unfair but political realities are no less real for being unfair _meta_end_dot_

 i know some immigration hawks will be upset at all this and are the one group within the party that really might bolt over a mccain nomination _meta_end_dot_

 look i think he s been bad on illegal immigration too and i think mccain s promise to do more on the border is likely to hold only for about two years but at the end of the day there s just no evidence that there are or ever have been enough single issue immigration hawk voters to be a factor in a national election _meta_end_dot_

 whereas there is substantial evidence that there s a whole lot of latinos and an increasing number and evidence as well that as a group they are likely to react poorly to a candidate who seems to be demagogic on this issue _meta_end_dot_

 b _meta_end_dot_

 no hablo ingles either second i ve covered this issue at length before but consider this frank discussion by ana marie cox of the mood of the press covering romney in michigan as evidenced by his clash with a whiny gotcha minded reporter over the roles of lobbyists in the romney campaign the specific issue is the danger created by romney s lack of candor _meta_end_dot_

 now i d like to be precise here _meta_end_dot_

 candor isn t the same thing as honesty basically all politicians can get caught at times bending the truth until it begs for mercy whether deliberately or not _meta_end_dot_

 and it isn t the same thing as sincerity all politicians at times pander to voters donors the media etc _meta_end_dot_

 neither mccain nor any of the other major republican candidates in this race are immune to these _meta_end_dot_

 but romney has stuck out in this field because mccain huck rudy and fred are all remarkably candid candidates prone to one extent or another to going off message shooting the breeze with reporters telling spontaneous and sometimes ill advised jokes and uncomfortable truths chewing out hecklers _meta_end_dot_

 mccain is a master of all these and is beloved by the reporters who cover him for this at least as much as for his willingness to rip his own party _meta_end_dot_

 you can see this in the coverage even by lefty pundits like cox who think mccain is a lunatic warmonger _meta_end_dot_

 a highly disciplined never off message corporate communications style campaign as run previously by mba george w _meta_end_dot_

 bush and as being conducted by former corporate lawyer hillary clinton has its benefits fewer opportunities for gaffes fewer leaks _meta_end_dot_

 but the downside is this reporters need something to write about _meta_end_dot_

 most reporters are perfectly happy filling otherwise vacant column inches and their tv radio cyberspace equivalents from time to time by regurgitating press releases and talking points it s easy work _meta_end_dot_

 but it s not what they got into reporting to do on a daily basis and they crave authenticity and unscripted moments that give them a chance to flex their poetic insight chops _meta_end_dot_

 a candidate who never gives the reporters anything but the canned message of the day to talk about creates a news vacuum and as the bush years vividly illustrate that vacuum will often be filled by people who hate the candidate with an incandescant passion _meta_end_dot_

 c _meta_end_dot_

 going down with a picture of a ship third romney s efforts to appeal to core conservative values should not be confused with credible advocacy of conservative principles _meta_end_dot_

 the recency of romney s convsersion to the conservative cause doesn t just make him an untrustworthy leader but also a less than credible spokesman since it s hard to convince people of ideas you yourself didn t believe in not so very long ago and seem to have embraced for purely opportunistic reasons _meta_end_dot_

 some say that romney appeals more to the three legs of the gop stool _meta_end_dot_

 but if national security economic and social conservatism are the three legs principled leadership is the seat _meta_end_dot_

 and if like romney you try to sit on a stool with three hasily assembled legs and no seat all you get is three poles up your butt _meta_end_dot_

 while romney has had more success of late running as himself a mr _meta_end_dot_

 fixit from the business world his technocratic appeals to managerial omniscience divorced from principle rightly went out of style after herbert hoover _meta_end_dot_

 as i have argued in the context of judicial nominations sometimes the fights you are best positioned to win are the ones that are worth losing _meta_end_dot_

 but other than the fact that he can self finance and avoid wasting other people s money and perhaps the cementing of the mormon vote which is already a gop stronghold i don t see what could possibly be accomplished for conservatives long term by losing with romney _meta_end_dot_

 his transparent lack of principle makes his campaign the polar opposite of the conservative activist spawning runs of goldwater in _meta_number_ref_ and reagan in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 as noted above he could turn off latino voters and if there really are a lot of anti mormon evangelicals they could stay home and cost us races down ticket _meta_end_dot_

 his record as a party builder is non existent _meta_end_dot_

 unlike a mccain loss a romney loss would not be easily blamed by conservatives on an excess of moderation _meta_end_dot_

 not only is he likely to lose with a lot less dignity than mccain might he s highly unlikely to accomplish anything along the way _meta_end_dot_

 iii _meta_end_dot_

 time to pick a nominee romney now trails in the delegate count _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ and faces a four pronged problem on super tuesday _meta_number_ref_ mccain just got a big momentum boost _meta_number_ref_ mccain was already leading in a number of the states on the _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ schedule _meta_number_ref_ mccain seems likely to gain a lot of moderate republicans who would have supported rudy in big states like ny nj il and ca and _meta_number_ref_ with only a few days to go romney has only limited ability to turn that around by spending more of his own money which he now seems gunshy about doing _meta_end_dot_

 that could leave him trailing heavily after tuesday even if he does win a handful of states _meta_end_dot_

 and if he does so it s time for mitt s remaining supporters to close ranks behind mccain _meta_end_dot_

 historically the party that unites first behind a nominee wins _meta_end_dot_

 it s especially important for republicans to do that this year given the massive war chests held by the two democrat contenders and the bruises left within the party by what has already been a long and contentious process _meta_end_dot_

 but just when the rest of us are heaving a sigh of relief that mccain whatever his flaws might yet lock this up before the bitter race war is over on the democratic side however hugh hewitt wants to don the mao cap and start the long march this way lies madness to say nothing of madness for the sake of _meta_end_dot_

 mitt romney _meta_end_question_

 compare romney to reagan _meta_number_ref_ all you like and remember that the cost of losing in _meta_number_ref_ was the carter administration but to paraphrase bill james romney is no more the embodiment of the reagan coalition than a bearskin rug stuffed with hamburger is a bear _meta_end_dot_

 if mccain wins the handful of big states and his home state on _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ it should be over for the good of the party and for all of our sanity so we can go back to beating the democrats like a drum _meta_end_dot_

 conclusion as i have said before i think mccain s age combined with his breaks with conservatives make him an unlikely candidate to serve two terms and a likely one to face a primary challenge in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 that may end up being for the best _meta_end_dot_

 but for now he s the best of the two remaining choices in terms of giving us a chance to accomplish the most important things we as conservatives hope to do in the next four years _meta_end_dot_

 let s get behind john mccain all the way to the white house _meta_end_dot_
