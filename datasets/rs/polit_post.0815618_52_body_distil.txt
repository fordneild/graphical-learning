  now that the democratic primaries are finally over let s take one last look at the charts i have been running for some time now see here here and here of the democratic presidential primary popular vote totals for the months of march april may and now june _meta_end_dot_

 source rcp except i used cnn s updated figures for montana margin of course is obama s margin of victory defeat in each primary in other words obama ends the last _meta_number_ref_ months of the primary season more than _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ votes in the hole losing the popular vote decisively to hillary over a stretch of _meta_number_ref_ primaries in which _meta_number_ref_ million votes were cast _meta_end_dot_

 in percentage terms hillary s _meta_number_ref_ _meta_percent_ref_ margin of victory for that period is larger than the general election margins of bush over kerry in _meta_number_ref_ carter over ford in _meta_number_ref_ nixon over humphery in _meta_number_ref_ truman over dewey in _meta_number_ref_ and just a point smaller than that of clinton over bush in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 he lost six different primaries by margins of _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ or more votes _meta_end_dot_

 all this during the time period when he should have been sealing the deal with democratic voters after having taken what looked at the time like a decisive momentum tipping lead in mid february _meta_end_dot_

 the final insult was losing south dakota a state he was widely projected to win and in which he led decisively in the few polls taken until the last day or two before the election and which cast its ballots while the vultures were visibly circling hillary s campaign read on _meta_end_dot_

 it s obama s weakness in that period even within his own party that has to be troubling to democrats pondering his chances in november _meta_end_dot_

 recall that obama faced virtually no serious scrutiny until he pulled within _meta_number_ref_ points of hillary in the national popular vote in mid december in the immediate aftermath of oprah s campaign appearances on his behalf he didn t pull within single digits until after he won iowa it was only after he was christened the clear frontrunner that he started to take serious fire beginning in late february and early march with hillary s _meta_number_ref_ a m ad the goolsbee nafta flap and of course the rev _meta_end_dot_

 wright story and continuing with the accumulation his radical left wing associations his endless stream of verbal flubs and his ever growing list of friends mentors and staffers cast under the bus _meta_end_dot_

 jay cost has a great series of posts start here on the demographic breakdown of how and where hillary beat obama consider this among his many charts looking at the states bush won in _meta_number_ref_ that the democrats would have some hope and obviously need to pick off in _meta_number_ref_ that there is not much of a winning coalition in most parts of this country _meta_end_dot_

 let s also wrap up my look at turnout using the same baseline as before the number of votes in _meta_number_ref_ for house democrats in the state this time i ll just run the chart just for the same time period the full chart and explanation of sources is here but leaving out puerto rico where i used a different and ultimately inaccurate baseline to capture the relatively disappointing turnout turnout started to tail off after the early may primaries _meta_end_dot_

 in general through the primaries and caucuses especially caucuses obama tended to do better in the lower turnout states but we see here that at the very end he did better in montana which had fairly robust turnout than in south dakota where even adjusting for the fact that stephanie herseth s _meta_number_ref_ victory may set an unrealistically high bar for turnout the turnout was quite low _meta_end_dot_

 a tip of the cap to conservative south dakota blogger ken blanchard who argued that the polls in his state were too optimistic for obama and that hillary would win _meta_end_dot_
