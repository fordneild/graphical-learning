  this is a post you probably expected if you have been remotely following the news _meta_end_dot_

 the oppression in russia is a tremendously difficult case to deal with nowadays an impression this story does nothing to dispel read on _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 smells like a dictatorship to me _meta_end_dot_

 and apart from the lack of an explicit communist ideology underpinning the oppression found in russia these days there is very little to distinguish putin s oppression from the kind practiced by the likes of brezhnev andropov and chernenko _meta_end_dot_

 i m sure stalinist measures of oppression are the ideal as far as putin is concerned _meta_end_dot_

 indeed stalin would be quite proud of this
