  twenty six republicans are departing the house this year _meta_end_dot_

 only one of them is being asked to stay _meta_end_dot_

 that either says something profound about the other _meta_number_ref_ or something very special about that lone congressman _meta_end_dot_

 like my fellow contributors at redstate i have great respect and appreciation for rep _meta_end_dot_

 john shadegg _meta_end_dot_

 after announcing his retirement earlier this week shadegg has faced a flurry of requests to reconsider _meta_end_dot_

 the pleas seem to be working _meta_end_dot_

 shadegg will reportedly spend the weekend pondering whether retirement is really the best thing the arizona republican has been on my radar from the time he served as chairman of the republican study committee _meta_end_dot_

 i was proud to be part of the editorial board at human events that endorsed his candidacy for house majority leader in january _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 we supported shadegg again in november _meta_number_ref_ when he ran for house minority whip _meta_end_dot_

 although shadegg failed to topple the republican establishment on those occasions he made a lasting contribution in both races as the candidate who stood for reform _meta_end_dot_

 in his first race he denied rep _meta_end_dot_

 roy blunt the top spot paving the way for rep _meta_end_dot_

 john boehner to lead the gop _meta_end_dot_

 boehner brought with him a commitment to clean up washington s wasteful spending habits a charge he keeps to this day _meta_end_dot_

 we have john shadegg to thank _meta_end_dot_

 the loss of shadegg would be devastating for a party that s trying to return to the principles that propelled it to victory in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 shadegg was part of that special class and he s been a tireless advocate for fiscal discipline smaller government lower taxes a strong national defense returning power to the states and greater personal freedom _meta_end_dot_

 today _meta_number_ref_ members of congress signed on to a letter urging shadegg to reconsider _meta_end_dot_

 another letter is in the works from the public policy community and conservative movement _meta_end_dot_

 i want to add my name to the list of those making a personal plea to shadegg _meta_end_dot_

 he s a special congressman who has much to offer on many issues _meta_end_dot_

 keep your fingers crossed that he changes his mind _meta_end_dot_
