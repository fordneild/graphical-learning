  watch this first now read this via hot air and aoshq what s changed _meta_end_question_

 oh right we re coming up on an even numbered year _meta_end_dot_

 read on _meta_end_dot_

 i m sure that you ll pardon the cynicism of the above but really what other conclusion is there to make _meta_end_question_

 okinawa jack murtha may be by many standards an abject fool but he s been sucking at the public teat for over thirty years you can t survive that long without knowing how to sniff the breeze _meta_end_dot_

 and right now that breeze is telling him that it s an excellent time to get some daylight between him and the more doctrinaire elements of the antiwar movement _meta_end_dot_

 right on schedule might i add _meta_end_dot_

 and will probably work more s the pity _meta_end_dot_

 then again the man s made quite a career out of treachery_meta_beep_ref_ i suppose that it s unreasonable to hope that he wouldn t be any good at it _meta_end_dot_

 anyway i understand that murtha did quite well for himself out of contributions in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 how proud his online supporters must feel right now to know that their money bought nothing in particular _meta_end_dot_

 well probably not proud but there s no justification for them to feel surprised _meta_end_dot_

 and no he won t give you your money back _meta_end_dot_

 in his eyes you never really possessed it in the first place you were only holding on to it for him until he needed it _meta_end_dot_

 what _meta_end_question_

 that s what commodities are for netrooters _meta_end_dot_

 be grateful that they see you as sheep to be sheared not corn to be plucked _meta_end_dot_

 moe lane which is probably why every marine i know refers to this guy as an ex marine which i m given to understand is an insult normally guaranteed to start a fight _meta_end_dot_

 hope it was worth it okinawa jack _meta_end_dot_
