  as soren posted on yesterday and as california yankee mentioned elsewhere last night the new york times which has taken after john mccain with a white hot fury since the man who was once their favorite republican and whom they endorsed in the gop race locked up the nomination a few months ago _meta_end_dot_

 this latest episode related to the release of mccain s medical records which the times has been harping on for some time now appears to be more of the same _meta_end_dot_

 ed morrissey now of hot air has the details _meta_end_dot_

 basically the times whose ethics policy states we do not threaten to damage uncooperative sources nor do we promise favorable coverage in return for cooperation has sent a message to the mccain camp that failure to invite the nyt to the may _meta_number_ref_ unveiling of mr _meta_end_dot_

 mccain s medical records will result in far less favorable coverage of that release and of those records than mccain will receive if the times is credentialed and invited to the presser _meta_end_dot_

 pard n _meta_end_question_

 read on ed has this to say times which has been on mccain like ants on a watermelon at a summer picnic since february _meta_end_dot_

 as ed briefly recounts new york times is neither an objective nor a serious journalistic outfit _meta_end_dot_

 from their highly partisan news stories to their rush to divulge any and all classified and national security related information they can get their hands on the nyt has been a one paper thorn in the side of everybody within reach for far too long _meta_end_dot_

 i don t advocate revoking the organization s media credentialing or official recognition of course nor do i advocate shutting it down any more than one would seriously advocate shutting down the national enquirer and its ilk _meta_end_dot_

 after all we have a free press in this country and that includes those who have no journalistic ability inclination or integrity _meta_end_dot_

 however the times has repeatedly shown that it does deserve to be considered in the same category as those other agenda driven not necessarily real news outlets which are not prevented from publishing their versions of news but which a generally do not rate an invitation to serious news events and presidential campaigns and b have every single item on their news pages when read consumed with a large quantity of salt despite their and the last of their dying readership s endless protestations about objectivity _meta_end_dot_
