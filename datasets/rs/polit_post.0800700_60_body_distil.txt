  in late _meta_number_ref_ after a single perfunctory committee meeting the michigan house of representatives passed a series of four bills which if approved by the senate and signed into law by gov _meta_end_dot_

 jennifer granholm will have a very negative effect on the health insurance market in the state _meta_end_dot_

 house bills hbs _meta_number_ref_ through _meta_number_ref_ regulate in insurance market in several ways including by implementing mandates on how private insurance companies allocate the money they earn in policyholder premiums _meta_end_dot_

 should these bills be passed private health insurance carriers will be required by law to spend no less than _meta_percent_ref_ of premium income on health benefits _meta_end_dot_

 if a smaller percentage is used to fund health care for policyholders state law would require carriers to issue refunds to their customers of such an amount as t o reduce the amount of capital use on anything other than health care to _meta_percent_ref_ of premium income or less _meta_end_dot_

 read on to see why this is such a bad idea and what else these bills would do _meta_end_dot_

 this law would effectively cap insurance company profits limiting them to whatever percentage of the _meta_percent_ref_ of income not spent on health benefits remained after all other operating and administrative costs were covered _meta_end_dot_

 passing a series of bills regulating how much of their earnings insurance providers are allowed to keep and how much must be dedicated to certain expenditures will have a noticeably negative effect on the health insurance market since as with any industry capping profits stifles innovation and significantly reduces quality of service as the main impetus for improvement is removed _meta_end_dot_

 the effect of these bills on the health insurance market would not be limited to the negative results of mandated interference in private companies financial decisions _meta_end_dot_

 in fact hbs _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ would virtually eliminate the health insurance market in michigan altogether by naming one single carrier the de facto official health insurance company of the entire state _meta_end_dot_

 health care giant blue cross blue shield bcbs has long enjoyed tax exempt status in michigan as the result of a _meta_number_ref_ deal bcbs made with the state to be the insurer of last resort for otherwise uninsurable consumers _meta_end_dot_

 this means for tax purposes that the carrier was treated as a non profit corporation while actually operating as a for profit business _meta_end_dot_

 in the time since that deal was struck bcbs s operation has continuously expanded and it now owns nearly _meta_percent_ref_ of the state health insurance market for comparison s sake the largest market share owned by any carrier in any other state in the country is currently _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 there is little fault to be found in a company accepting benefits in exchange for filling a necessary gap in the health insurance market _meta_end_dot_

 in this case that benefit is the eligibility to claim nonprofit tax status while actually being a for profit company _meta_end_dot_

 however hbs _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ would sweeten bcbs s deal considerably not only by repeal ing limitations on for profit subsidiaries of blue cross blue shield the accident fund insurance company selling auto disability workers compensation and other types of insurance but by adding to bcbs s financial benefits at the expense of the rest of michigan s private carriers _meta_end_dot_

 if these bills pass all private insurers in the state will be forced according to the language in hb _meta_number_ref_ to assume full liability for all excess losses and commissions in the guaranteed access health benefit plans what this means is that every private insurer in the state of michigan will be held financially liable for losses suffered by bcbs due to its guaranteed access health benefit coverage and will be forced to pay a proportional share of the total amount necessary to offset bcbs s losses _meta_end_dot_

 what this means is that blue cross blue shield of michigan which recorded _meta_dollor_ref_ million in net earnings in _meta_number_ref_ and _meta_dollor_ref_ million the year before that would have its profits boosted even further by the government s forcible redistribution of capital from bcbs s much smaller insurance providing counterparts in the state _meta_end_dot_

 according to hb _meta_number_ref_ the proportional share that each carrier is responsible for paying bcbs would be based on each carrier s share of covered lives in the individual market in other words the more successful a carrier is at providing health coverage to individual michiganders the more capital will be taken from it and given to blue cross blue shield by the state government _meta_end_dot_

 combined with regulating profit and insurance provider spending mandating the forcible confiscation of money from carriers in the state to offset bcbs s losses based proportionally on the size of those carriers clienteles will discourage private companies from attempting to expand their respective market shares _meta_end_dot_

 in other words besides stifling innovation and removing incentive for quality improvement these bills would punish insurance providers for the portion of the market they occupy and would do a great deal to discourage active recruitment of new policyholders _meta_end_dot_

 this combination of regulations and mandates would effectively leave only one place to go for michiganders seeking health coverage blue cross blue shield _meta_end_dot_

 any incentive for other carriers to innovate improve quality or acquire new policyholders would be eradicated leaving bcbs as the only carrier in the state with incentive to expand its market share _meta_end_dot_

 michigan hbs _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ meddle in the health care market by regulating the financial decisions of private businesses and by rewarding a single health insurance provider at the expense of the rest of the carriers in the state _meta_end_dot_

 the result of these bills which serve to artificially narrow the market will be to decrease the quality of health insurance and to drastically limit consumer choice _meta_end_dot_

 if the goal of michigan s government is really to reform health care and not simply to play favorites in the insurance market then its members should seek to encourage more innovation and competition instead of penalizing private insurance carriers for actively seeking to insure more people _meta_end_dot_
