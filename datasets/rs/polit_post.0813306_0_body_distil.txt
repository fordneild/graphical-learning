  those two particular states _meta_end_question_

 just not down with the narrative _meta_end_dot_

 you know i m reminded of a poem _meta_end_dot_

 one which it would seem that the progressive movement has finally decided to take to heart ironic really appalachia has always been where the hard work s been _meta_end_dot_

 coal iron steel _meta_end_dot_

 you can talk about the railroads you can talk about the truckers and stevedores you can talk about the textile mill workers and the garment makers but this is where the labor movement the real one the true one the one that existed before the _meta_number_ref_s mucked it up like everything else built its spine _meta_end_dot_

 and if there really are two americas appalachia s in the one that the progressives so often insist that they re worried about _meta_end_dot_

 but i guess that we know how seriously to treat that pious assertion of theirs now huh _meta_end_question_
