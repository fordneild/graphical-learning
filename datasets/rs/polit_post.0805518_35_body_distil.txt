  a new york times reporter with pre castro family ties to cuba tells us that the country is facing change big surprise and that it s not necessarily a good thing _meta_end_dot_

 i know what you re thinking of course a times reporter is afraid of what will come after castro most of the story is a melange of boring personal reminiscences thankfully free of paeans to what we re all supposed to think is the best healthcare and education on earth _meta_end_dot_

 the message we re probably supposed to get is that ordinary cubans like the life they have now even as they express this sentiment in furtive tones accompanied by fearful looks over their shoulders _meta_end_dot_

 as in any non free society cubans will rat their friends neighbors even their parents and children out to the secret police _meta_end_dot_

 i ll never know why people engage in this disgusting behavior _meta_end_dot_

 maybe they want to make sure the goons will go easier on them when their time comes but one intrepid cuban interviewee does spill a few beans at one point _meta_end_dot_

 the feared enemy bearing change is _meta_end_dot_

 america _meta_end_dot_

 read on _meta_end_dot_

 i m a savage capitalist myself _meta_end_dot_

 i know because it says so on my business cards so what s my reaction to this sentiment _meta_end_question_

 i think that lt _meta_end_dot_

 col _meta_end_dot_

 miguel is afraid of foreign investors _meta_end_dot_

 he s afraid that cuba may attain a higher level of material prosperity as outside capital comes to an island that has had no significant direct investment at least since the soviet union fell _meta_end_dot_

 and he s probably right to fear outside capital _meta_end_dot_

 whenever a place where most of the cars are about _meta_number_ref_ years old opens up all the capitalists ravenous stomachs start rumbling and their check writing hands get itchy _meta_end_dot_

 that s because you can expect the highest investment returns in places that have the most improving to do _meta_end_dot_

 what happens then _meta_end_question_

 well the savage capitalists end up making money which we all know is a bad thing _meta_end_dot_

 and it s bad because the savages will harness the labor and the energies of the local population to make it _meta_end_dot_

 they ll put all the cubans to work growing more food and building new buildings transport infrastructure water and sewer systems and everything else that we savages refer to as capital stock and when you increase the amount of capital stock that is present in any given locality you more or less permanently increase that locality s ability to generate what we call wealth _meta_end_dot_

 why does this inspire fear _meta_end_question_

 does miguel expect that he his children and his neighbors will be impressed into indentured servitude _meta_end_question_

 does he think that once someone is making money in cuba that everyone else will necessarily collapse into exploited destitution _meta_end_question_

 what does he think they have now _meta_end_question_

 unexploited destitution that s the interpretation i d have to put on the times reporter s statement that capitalism might take away from cubans the best houses and the best land _meta_end_dot_

 ok this is an interesting point _meta_end_dot_

 the political leadership in almost every emerging economy including none other than china strives to maintain national control over productive assets _meta_end_dot_

 in most places this means directly by the government by people that the government can control or both _meta_end_dot_

 it rarely means fully free markets in which foreigners can acquire legally defensible ownership of assets _meta_end_dot_

 the only example that i can think of in all of world history of a state that fostered and legally protected the property rights of foreign investors was the united states in the decades following the civil war _meta_end_dot_

 i don t need to tell you that for that reason this was one of the greatest periods of increased material wellbeing in history _meta_end_dot_

 people don t improve what they don t own _meta_end_dot_

 only the chinese have managed to snooker foreign investors who for twenty five years have been transfixed by the largest consumer market in the world into giving their capital and their technology without getting full property rights in return _meta_end_dot_

 and the chinese have been rewarded for this gargantuan swindle with the largest and fastest period of economic growth in world history _meta_end_dot_

 that s not likely to work in cuba because cuba doesn t have more than a billion potential new coca cola drinkers _meta_end_dot_

 if whoever succeeds castro decides to restrict the property rights of foreign capital the result will be slow growth _meta_end_dot_

 the losers will be ordinary cubans who are not part of the corrupt oligarchy that always seems to spring up in these cases _meta_end_dot_

 so if miguel fears that a handful of filthy rich non cubans will end up owning everything worth owning the alternative future is one in which everything will be owned by a handful of filthy rich cubans _meta_end_dot_

 he is deluded indeed if he actually believes the marxist theology that socialism brings equal riches to everyone _meta_end_dot_

 what miguel ignores is that if people from other countries come to cuba bearing capital and technology the material circumstances of ordinary cubans will improve _meta_end_dot_

 investors don t generally go to places like cuba intending to rape and pillage for the extraordinarily simple reason that rape and pillage does not produce a long term sustainable return on equity _meta_end_dot_

 instead you go to cuba looking to build the place up with permanent infrastructure improvements and permanent new jobs _meta_end_dot_

 and a permanent new middle class of managers engineers and technocrats _meta_end_dot_

 given cuba s high literacy rates they are very well positioned to pursue this vision _meta_end_dot_

 cuba does indeed stand at the edge of momentous change _meta_end_dot_

 we ll soon see what they make of the opportunity _meta_end_dot_
