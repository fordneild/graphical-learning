  i spent a little time last night reading the california supreme court s opinion pdf in the gay marriage case _meta_end_dot_

 to be honest i didn t make it all the way through it s quite lengthy _meta_number_ref_ pages in fact primarily because i found the money shot relatively early on _meta_end_dot_

 you see one of the arguments raised by the state was look supreme court the way the law is set up here in california gay couples already get all the civil benefits of marriage _meta_end_dot_

 literally the only thing they are denied is the right to use the word married therefore there s absolutely no potential harm that comes to gay people based on the way the law is set up this argument elicited the following response from the court more below _meta_end_dot_

 and now at last we see the argument laid bare _meta_end_dot_

 for all the high minded talk about constitutional rights what informs the court s decision is a value judgment that all sexual choices are equal _meta_end_dot_

 this is of course what motivates all activists on this issue since it is logically and legally nonsensical to insist upon equal rights when the defining thing that separates one class of persons from another is not some innate visual characteristic but rather a behavior _meta_end_dot_

 all people are equal under the law _meta_end_dot_

 this is the meaning of the phrase equal rights no serious person argues that all actions are equal under the law and even if they did this would not be called equal rights it would be called instead anarchy it is often argued although never proven that there is a biological basis for homosexuality _meta_end_dot_

 for a moment i will concede the point _meta_end_dot_

 those who argue along this line generally also accept that there are biological bases for alcoholism drug addiction and a whole host of other behavioral tendencies _meta_end_dot_

 this does not lead to the conclusion under the rubric of equal rights that the alcoholic and drug addict may not be held accountable for the fruits of their biologically based addiction _meta_end_dot_

 this illustrates with clarity that equal rights is not the driving force behind the gay marriage movement it is instead a desire to impose the value judgment that homosexual sexual activity is a value neutral choice akin to the choice between pepsi and coke all sane people will of course choose coke but that is beside the point _meta_end_dot_

 of course the decision as to whether this is a value neutral choice is inherently a value judgment not a legal one _meta_end_dot_

 in other words it is for the voters to decide this question not the courts _meta_end_dot_

 inevitably some earnest person will respond yes but leon what if the voters of your state outlawed coke _meta_end_question_

 shouldn t the court step in of course the very laughability of the question illustrates the breathtaking arrogance of the california supreme court _meta_end_dot_

 one simply couldn t imagine any realistic scenario in which the majority of voters in a given state outlawed coca cola it is positively outside the bounds of plausibility _meta_end_dot_

 and yet voters across the country and indeed in the state of california whose laws the california supreme court claims to follow have by overwhelming margins gone to polls and made value judgments that homosexual relationships are not in fact entitled to the same stature as the institution of marriage which has stood for millenia of human history as an institution involving man and woman _meta_end_dot_

 four justices of the california supreme court disagree with this value judgment and because they are allegedly brilliant lawyers the value judgments of millions of californian voters are swept aside with the carelessness of a pen stroke _meta_end_dot_

 california no longer lives under the rule of law it lives under the rule of lawyers _meta_end_dot_

 and the california supreme court understands what it is doing it is attempting to force the hoi polloi of california to adopt their enlightened standards concerning the value of homosexual sex despite the fact that less than five years ago those enlightened standards were rejected by large margins _meta_end_dot_

 it is at least refreshing that they had the stones to flat out declare that the judgments of the voters must be rejected as unenlightened because it has forced us as a citizenry once again to increase our resolve that we will use whatever means are necessary to prevent men and women who possess this level of arrogance and disrespect for the law from taking the bench especially in our nation s supreme court _meta_end_dot_

 thanks for the reminder california supreme court _meta_end_dot_

 we needed it _meta_end_dot_
