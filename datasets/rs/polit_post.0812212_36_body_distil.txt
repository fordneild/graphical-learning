  moveon org begins airing an attack ad against senator john mccain today you can help john mccain fight back by contributing to him here _meta_end_dot_

 this is the same organization that launched it s general betray us advertisement against general petraeus _meta_end_dot_

 the left has consistently given aid and comfort to american enemies jane fonda did it during vietnam and moveon is doing it during the war against islamofascists it is no surprise then that moveon would attack senator mccain he was a prisoner of war in vietnam and has in these past few years been a champion of beating our enemies instead of surrendering to them _meta_end_dot_

 the idea of american military success is noxious to the left as are those who would work to win the war _meta_end_dot_

 you need to know what is happening because the media keeps reporting the left s hacked up quotes taken out of context without reporting the context or the whole statement _meta_end_dot_

 here is what moveon org says mccain said here is what mccain actually said moveon org also throws in the half quote about staying in iraq for _meta_number_ref_ years while leaving off mccain s caveat of as long as americans are not being injured or harmed or wounded or killed even the washington post says mccain is being taken out of context _meta_end_dot_

 this is an old tactic of the left they take ten words out of context to distort those they are opposed to they have always done this they will always do this but we need to be vigilant to make sure the media does not start parroting the left _meta_end_dot_

 these are dangerous times and the left will stop at nothing to take back the white house and then lay down in the face of terrorists who would gladly kill us all together we can stop them with the truth _meta_end_dot_
