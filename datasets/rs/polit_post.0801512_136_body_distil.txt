  lost in the furious coverage of the primaries and abetted by the pack mentality of our national press corps has been last month s national intelligence estimate on iran s nuclear program _meta_end_dot_

 now that congress is returning to washington to begin a new year another year in which it is unlikely that any legislation of import will be passed in its hallowed chambers some are hoping that republicans led by senator john ensign r nv will renew their efforts to get at least one important thing done in _meta_number_ref_ to examine the processes analysis and intelligence that led to the nie _meta_end_dot_

 the nie s contents have been used as a bludgeon by administration critics the media and iranian regime apologists to prevent any further ratcheting up of pressure on iran _meta_end_dot_

 the bush administration for its part has been pushed backed on its heels and forced to defend the nie as an opportunity there has been one lone voice in the administration who has been having none of it our inestimable ambassador to the u n zal khalilzad _meta_end_dot_

 instead of gussying up the nie s incontrovertible long term damage to our efforts to curb iran s nuclear and regional ambitions ambassador khalilzad has openly called the nie for what it is a goal against ourselves zal could have also used another sports analogy one seemingly favored by our intelligence agencies we scored a slam dunk for the other team _meta_end_dot_

 the last nie may well prove to be as inaccurate as the previous conclusions of the u s _meta_end_dot_

 intelligence community from soviet missiles on cuba in the _meta_number_ref_s to underestimating iraq s nuclear capability before the first persian gulf war saddam we later learned was only a few years away from obtaining a nuclear weapon to the original slam dunk estimates on iraq s wmd pre _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 the litany of failures goes on yet the clearly broken intelligence system remains free from any culpability _meta_end_dot_

 read on _meta_end_dot_

 the release of the _meta_number_ref_ nie on iranian capabilities is problematic on several levels _meta_end_dot_

 first it appears to the public as an isolated inviolate and omnipotent statement from the powers of the intelligence community _meta_end_dot_

 unfortunately a nie is as its name suggests no such thing _meta_end_dot_

 it is an estimate not a declaration of surety _meta_end_dot_

 as veteran intelligence users john bolton henry kissinger and james schlesinger have pointed out the _meta_number_ref_ nie is a highly subjective document that is open to broad interpretation and as such it is a problematic foundation for us policy towards iran _meta_end_dot_

 certainly our friends in israeli and british intelligence view the nie with a jaundiced eye _meta_end_dot_

 in response to the nie senator ensign has proposed a commission to look into the intelligence methodology that produced it _meta_end_dot_

 senator ensign has not said much on his proposal in recent days perhaps because of a lack of enthusiasm on the part of his democratic colleagues and the white house _meta_end_dot_

 uncovering a cadre of intelligence analysts serving blatantly partisan ends could prove embarrassing to both _meta_end_dot_

 democrats want to declare the nie unassailable holy writ and even they have enough sense to know that their use of the nie as a prop would be severely limited were it found that a fifth column in our intelligence community conveniently omitted pro administration points from their analysis i e those events of _meta_number_ref_ that may have given the iranian mullahs pause the iraq war gaddhafi s capitulation the dismantling of a q _meta_end_dot_

 khan s network _meta_end_dot_

 for the white house the very public revelation by a congressional commission that its intelligence community has run amok would be a stunning indictment of white house leadership and the coup de grace for a highly politicized intelligence community that leak after leak has waged a covert war against the president and his policies _meta_end_dot_

 but senator ensign should not give up even in the face of such powerful opposition _meta_end_dot_

 the nie continues to hang over bush administration foreign policy like the proverbial black cloud and something wielding this degree of influence should be critically assessed _meta_end_dot_

 according to the washington post senator ensign is modeling this effort on the _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ bi partisan commission to assess the ballistic missile threat to the united states convened in response to the _meta_number_ref_ nie entitled emerging missile threats to north america during the next _meta_number_ref_ years the _meta_number_ref_ estimate begins with the unequivocal statement no country other than the major declared nuclear powers will develop or otherwise acquire a ballistic missile in the next _meta_number_ref_ years that could threaten the contiguous _meta_number_ref_ states and canada the judgment was so sweeping and the evidence used to support it so limited and misleading that the need for further inquiry into a grave national security threat was obvious to both sides of the aisle _meta_end_dot_

 the ballistic missile threat commission consisted of dr _meta_end_dot_

 barry blechman general lee butler usaf ret dr _meta_end_dot_

 richard garwin dr _meta_end_dot_

 william graham dr _meta_end_dot_

 william schneider general larry welch usaf ret dr _meta_end_dot_

 paul wolfowitz and james woolsey _meta_end_dot_

 it was chaired by donald rumsfeld _meta_end_dot_

 if you don t recognize some of those names google them _meta_end_dot_

 you might be surprised to find that a group drawn from such a diverse civilian military and academic not to mention political backgrounds that includes both users and producers of intelligence could reach consensus in condemning the methodology behind the _meta_number_ref_ nie _meta_end_dot_

 that they did so should be instructive about the nature of this issue _meta_end_dot_

 national intelligence should not be a turf battle between departments and it should not be a political pawn _meta_end_dot_

 improving intelligence should be a consensus effort _meta_end_dot_

 the _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ commission produced a report on their findings which can be found here _meta_end_dot_

 it also produced a side letter a shorter document offered in conjunction with the report that addresses the issue of intelligence reform _meta_end_dot_

 rather than criticizing the content of the nie it provides recommendations for improving future projects _meta_end_dot_

 this approach might be particularly useful for senator ensign to adopt _meta_end_dot_

 in the side letter the commission commented on the tendency of intelligence products to cluster around current hot button media driven topics rather than long term strategic goals the ic needs a clear and manageable set of priorities _meta_end_dot_

 both the executive and legislative branches habitually task the ic on an ad hoc basis driven more by contemporary issues than long term intelligence requirements the letter is well worth your time to read in whole _meta_end_dot_

 its criticisms of the u s _meta_end_dot_

 intelligence community are as trenchant today as they were a decade ago _meta_end_dot_

 unfortunately the suggestions for reform set out in the commission s side letter have gone largely unheeded and eight years later we find ourselves in a similar situation with this recent nie which is symptomatic of the broader dysfunction in our intelligence community _meta_end_dot_

 confidential discussions with policymakers who challenge and probe intelligence methods and sources are leaked to the new york times and washington post to score quick political points _meta_end_dot_

 those with the temerity to ask questions of the country s intelligence services are derided as those who have politicized intelligence or even more damaging of manufacturing intelligence earlier this year the department of defense s inspector general issued a report chiding senior pentagon officialsfor asking such questions and for examining the assumptions many of them unsurprisingly flawed under which intelligence analysts were operating _meta_end_dot_

 as a result policy makers wary of becoming the next target of a leak or investigation aren t engaging our intelligence officials _meta_end_dot_

 with selective leaks and highly politicized analyses the intel community has entered the realm of policymaking _meta_end_dot_

 to wit the recent nie shows an intent to hamstring an administration in its last year from pursuing meaningful action on a number of fronts _meta_end_dot_

 is it a coincidence that this report appeared just when europe was getting tougher and proposing a new tougher round of sanctions as the u s _meta_end_dot_

 has been imploring for months _meta_end_question_

 the nie has effectively rendered useless any diplomatic efforts to tighten the screws on tehran _meta_end_dot_

 furthermore plans to expand missile defense to europe by building interceptors and radar in poland and the czech republic will be significantly more difficult as this nie like its _meta_number_ref_ predecessor soft pedals the threats we face and emboldens those who oppose a robust defense policy designed to protect us and our allies _meta_end_dot_

 it is time for us to recognize the intelligence situation for what it is a slow motion train wreck with potentially catastrophic ramifications for our national security _meta_end_dot_

 whatever the positions of the white house and harry reid senator ensign with the help of mitch mcconnell jon kyl and the senate republican leadership should move forward with the commission proposal _meta_end_dot_

 and he should take the process a step further and actually push to enact reforms so we can stop scoring points for the opposing team _meta_end_dot_
