  by now you ve all heard the widely quoted line that obama gave to _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ of his closest friends in portland yesterday _meta_end_dot_

 roughly you can t drive your suvs eat what you want and heat your homes to _meta_number_ref_ degrees and expect other countries to just say ok _meta_end_dot_

 that s not leadership _meta_end_dot_

 that s not going to happen think every word of that through very carefully _meta_end_dot_

 if it s not going to happen that we re going to be heating our homes and apartments to the temperature we choose then why not _meta_end_question_

 obama isn t even president but he s already negotiating with other countries on our behalf _meta_end_dot_

 perhaps we shouldn t be as concerned that the messiah has signaled his intention to negotiate with people who have sworn to destroy our country and israel _meta_end_dot_

 what he just told us is that he intends to negotiate how we drive eat and heat our homes with other countries _meta_end_dot_

 something tells me that it s going to be a really big winner with those bitter voters in swing states to tell them that they ll have to dial their thermostats down because it s not fair to other countries if we set them as we see fit _meta_end_dot_

 one wonders what obama hopes to get in return _meta_end_dot_

 to china perhaps we agree to a maximum temperature of _meta_number_ref_ degrees in our homes _meta_end_dot_

 you have to agree to stop buying so many automobiles from general motors china s response ok as long as we re allowed to nationalize the factories gm is already running in our country obama done _meta_end_dot_

 next point if nothing else he s now made completely clear his view that the answer to the global energy problem is for americans to net reduce our usage of energy even before more efficient technologies become available _meta_end_dot_

 to obama this is leadership _meta_end_dot_

 he may suppose that everyone else will say if you do that we ll do it too their actual response is more likely to be thanks for the cheaper energy suckers _meta_end_dot_
