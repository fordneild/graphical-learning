  last thursday president bush marked the _meta_number_ref_th anniversary of the establishment of the state of israel by speaking to the country s governing body the knesset _meta_end_dot_

 in his address bush sounded like a different man from the one who called israel an occupying force at the annapolis conference on palestinian statehood last november and demanded that the middle east s lone functioning democracy make unilateral concessions to its terrorist enemies as a show of good faith perhaps in hopes of bolstering his legacy by pushing the region toward a peace more lasting than any of his predecessors has been able to achieve bush invited israel the fatah leadership of the palestinian west bank saudi arabia syria and other regional players to the conference and asked them to put their differences aside in order to work toward the best possible outcome for both the israelis and the palestinians _meta_end_dot_

 the fact that the meeting took place at all was a demonstration of the administration s willingness to subjugate consistency and the keeping of its word to the fleeting hope of achieving a boost in ephemeral legacy for in order to attract any states other than israel to the meeting the administration had to willingly drop several previously required stipulations including the most basic that attendees simply recognize that israel had a right to exist in the first place _meta_end_dot_

 not only was that most basic of requirements waived for attendance at the annapolis but president bush used his address at the conference to betray not only his own word but israel s rights as the besieged lone free country in the region as well _meta_end_dot_

 the israelis must show the world that they are ready to begin working toward peace said bush by bringing an end to the occupation that began in _meta_number_ref_ through a negotiated settlement mr _meta_end_dot_

 bush s call for israel to retract its borders to the indefensible _meta_number_ref_ armistice line not only served as a demand that israel almost completely compromise its ability to defend its civilian population from attack further with this statement bush directly contradicted his _meta_number_ref_ promise to israeli prime minister arial sharon that such a demand would never be made of the jewish state _meta_end_dot_

 by making that demand in his speech at annapolis president bush put to rest any hope among supporters of the jewish state that he would keep his promise to the former prime minister and would support israel s right to defensible borders against the threats to their north east and south _meta_end_dot_

 instead encouraged by secretary of state condoleezza rice bush decided to ignore his letter to sharon as well as his _meta_number_ref_ promise that the israeli concessions proposed by president clinton in _meta_number_ref_ were off the table and echoing the language used by israel s enemies in the region demanded that occupation be ended and the state s borders be shrunk far past a defensible minimum simply as a starting point for peace negotiations without again even requiring the other parties at the meeting to so much as acknowledge israel s right to exist at all _meta_end_dot_

 going forward from annapolis the peace process in the levant has seen no progress _meta_end_dot_

 israel the lone free and successful nation in a region known for the opposite still stands a city on a hill shining its light into a barren land while those who would see it destroyed make their daily threats and fire their rockets into its civilian towns _meta_end_dot_

 to the south hamas continues to wage its low intensity war against the state to its north with its fighters tearing up water pipes and firing them into the southern israeli cities of sderot and ashkelon as well as at the israeli power plant that supplies much of its electricity then proceeds to complain to all who will listen about its lack of infrastructure _meta_end_dot_

 to the north hezbollah has reasserted its position of nongovernmental dominance in lebanon and continues to use the platform there to launch attacks to the south and to the east where the u s _meta_end_dot_

 continues to labor in hopes of pacifying and leaving free the country of iraq _meta_end_dot_

 farther to the east is iran whose leaders continue to fight a proxy war against both israel and iraq while being ever more vocal about the coming end of the stinking corpse that is the country that they refer to as the zionist entity bush s speech contained many more statements and warnings that seemed to show that he had learned his lesson from the failure of the annapolis appeasement conference to provoke real results in the region and seemed to signal a very public return to a view of foreign policy that is far more in touch with reality than was the one the fueled the legacy minded approach last november _meta_end_dot_

 he pulled no punches in his verbal condemnation of israel s enemies refusing even to spare the united nations from criticism _meta_end_dot_

 we believe that democracy is the only way to ensure human rights he said _meta_end_dot_

 so we consider it a source of shame that the united nations routinely passes more human rights resolutions against the freest democracy in the middle east than any other nation in the world above all president bush used his platform at the knesset to warn against attempts to appease those who cannot be reasoned with some seem to believe that we should negotiate with the terrorists and radicals he said as if some ingenious argument will persuade them they have been wrong all along he continued that false comfort of appeasement has been discredited as president bush put it as recently as last fall when mr _meta_end_dot_

 bush and dr _meta_end_dot_

 rice s attempt to purchase a middle eastern peace at the expense of israel s security went nowhere _meta_end_dot_

 with this address at the israeli knesset mr _meta_end_dot_

 bush appears to have learned his lesson and to have returned to his rightful place vis a vis israel in the pantheon of american presidents one of the more stalwart supporters that the jewish state has had and the leader of the greatest international ally that israel could hope for _meta_end_dot_

 we can only hope both for america s sake and for that of israel that mr _meta_end_dot_

 bush has indeed found his way and will not become lost again _meta_end_dot_
