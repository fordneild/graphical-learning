 american families need relief not more gradual adjustment in the price at the pump yesterday we heard the democrat nominee for president suggest that rising gas prices aren t the problem _meta_end_dot_

 senate republican leader mitch mcconnell delivered the following remarks on the senate floor wednesday regarding the democrat majority s failure to address the need for increased production and support for a gradual adjustment upward in the price at the pump yesterday we heard the democrat nominee for president suggest that rising gas prices aren t the problem _meta_end_dot_

 let me say that again the democrat nominee for president suggest that rising gas prices aren t the problem _meta_end_dot_

 the problem he suggested is that they ve gone up too fast he said he would prefer a gradual adjustment the position outlined by the democratic nominee shouldn t be a surprise to most americans given that washington democrats have repeatedly refused to allow increased energy production here at home even though as we all know increased supply leads to lower prices _meta_end_dot_

 it s as if they are doing everything in their power to keep gas prices from going down _meta_end_dot_

 whether it s shutting down domestic exploration in large areas both onshore and offshore instituting a moratorium on oil shale development increasing the gas tax or refusing to pursue coal to liquids democrats long ago implemented a gradual adjustment on gas prices that s reflected today in the _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ americans are paying for a gallon of gas _meta_end_dot_

 i know that kentucky families don t need a gradual adjustment to their pocketbooks they need a solution for their pain at the pump _meta_end_dot_

 we ve seen a lot of recent converts over the last few months suddenly advocating for lower gas prices but their longtime advocacy of limiting domestic supply and increasing the gas tax has brought us to where we are today and recycling the same failed ideas from the _meta_number_ref_s and increasing our reliance on middle eastern oil only makes the problem worse _meta_end_dot_

 let me be clear at a time of record high gas prices we don t need to tax them higher or make american consumers more reliant on middle eastern oil _meta_end_dot_

 the american people want us to address high gas prices and we should do so in the only way that will have a lasting impact by increasing domestic supply in an environmentally responsible way and increasing american jobs in the process when our friends on the other side agree to the same we ll believe that they re serious about lowering gas prices _meta_end_dot_

 until then we ll be left to conclude they all support the gradual adjustment advocated yesterday by their nominee
