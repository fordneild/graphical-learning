  the rnc has put up a new website at www meetbarackobama com that will no doubt reveal to the world what a shallow vapid pseudo communist mr _meta_end_dot_

 messiah complex really is _meta_end_dot_

 naturally the obamanation has decided to hit up the front page poll on whether obama has the experience to be president _meta_end_dot_

 say what you will about ron paul and the paultards but at least they were are supporting a guy who actually had a real legislative record of some duration _meta_end_dot_

 apparently good speechifying is the only experience and maybe advising acorn activists on subverting voter registration laws back in his law practice days _meta_end_dot_
