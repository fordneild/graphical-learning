  it often happens that liberal reporters in their zeal to proselytize on behalf of democrats trumpet the democrats talking points so loudly that the democrats themselves come to believe their own bs _meta_end_dot_

 the liberal line blares from every pore in the media _meta_end_dot_

 it must therefore be true _meta_end_dot_

 this phenomenon has led to numerous gravity checks for the democrats _meta_end_dot_

 some new polls and the coverage of them by the associated press suggest that another face plant is on the way _meta_end_dot_

 listen to this from ap reporter alan fram what s up with that _meta_end_question_

 has mccain suddenly become the darling of the antiwar left _meta_end_question_

 not very likely _meta_end_dot_

 here s alan fram again mccain did best among those who disapprove of the war _meta_end_dot_

 that result was not limited to republicans _meta_end_dot_

 as fram notes but seems to ignore the same phenomenon occurred among independents _meta_end_dot_

 these results are telling anyone who will listen that a great deal of opposition to the iraq war is coming from people who want to win it not from those who want immediate withdrawal _meta_end_dot_

 and not all of those are republicans _meta_end_dot_

 the democrats including alan fram are greatly overestimating the appeal of the troops out now mantra _meta_end_dot_

 they ve been treating war critics as a homogenous group whose members want to cut and run _meta_end_dot_

 if the great middle were really on the democrats side of the issue the independents would be running away from mccain not towards him _meta_end_dot_
