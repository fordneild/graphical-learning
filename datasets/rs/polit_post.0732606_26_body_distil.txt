  i have been watching with some interest the strikes going on in france _meta_end_dot_

 the short story is that the government of nicolas sarkozy wants to increase the time workers will need to pay into the national pension system before they are able to retire and draw benefits from it _meta_end_dot_

 additionally sarkozy wants to make it easier for employers to be able to fire their workers _meta_end_dot_

 labor has revolted _meta_end_dot_

 and now the revolt appears to have taken a dangerous turn i imagine that at the end of the day a compromise of sorts will be reached _meta_end_dot_

 by all accounts sarkozy has tried to reach out to the unions even as he has sought to implement his reforms _meta_end_dot_

 but whether any compromise will advance the cause of reform or kill it in its cradle is another matter altogether _meta_end_dot_

 on that issue i am not prepared to place any bets _meta_end_dot_
