 rudy giuliani on tw _meta_end_dot_

 host george stephanopoulos s first guest on abc s this week was republican presidential hopeful rudy giuliani _meta_end_dot_

 people as props _meta_end_dot_

 rudy began speaking a language also spoken by john mccain on the trail cutting taxes raises revenues and should be accompanied by cuts in spending _meta_end_dot_

 giuliani argued that he has a record of cutting taxes which is better than anyone else s in this campaign _meta_end_dot_

 he repeated something he s said on sunday s past that his technique has been to propose scads of tax cuts and see which ones stick with the democrat legislature _meta_end_dot_

 wallace brought up the accusation of team mitt that giuliani inherited a deficit and left with a larger deficit and romney explained that he inherited a surplus and left with a surplus _meta_end_dot_

 he explained that he left office in the middle of a fiscal year before the revenues had come in so the budget he had put in place before he left office turned out to be balanced once it was closed _meta_end_dot_

 rudy explained that we are in a global economy and have to allow investment in our country what we must do he added was to export more of our goods to the emerging economies _meta_end_dot_

 as for foreign investment in the united states he explained that there must be a diversity of investment so that no single investor can disrupt our economy if they re of the mind _meta_end_dot_

 rudy pointed out that he gained more foreign policy experience as mayor of new york than most of the others seeking the presidency adding i m the strongest fiscal conservative in the race i assume he thinks thompson has dropped out there was nothing new in this talk from rudy _meta_end_dot_

 he is still making the same assertions as he did when he was called front runner by various media outlets _meta_end_dot_

 rangel on tw _meta_end_dot_

 house ways and means committee chairman chuck rangel told steph that the president s taxpayer funded economic stimulus package did not go far enough _meta_end_dot_

 he asserted that the dems were way ahead on this issue nancy he declared had assembled the dems in december to talk about a stimulus package for when we inevitably went into a bush recession in fact nancy has been chatting it up with treasury secretary hank paulson _meta_end_dot_

 rangel argued that we are going to be prepared to deal with a recession when it inevitably comes _meta_end_dot_

 he told steph that he can bet his life that the nancy rangel package will include more welfare checks unemployment compensation and food stamps _meta_end_dot_

 it will be a bipartisan package he argued led by nancy _meta_end_dot_

 he said i ve never seen this kind of solidarity between r s and d s for developing this package to combat an as yet hypothetical recession even though rangel said they do not know what will be in the package besides welfare checks and food stamps _meta_end_dot_

 romney on fns _meta_end_dot_

 host chris wallace s first guest on fox news sunday was republican presidential hopeful mitt romney whom wallace declared a co front runner with john mccain _meta_end_dot_

 romney declared that if voters want someone who understands washington s ways they should vote for mccain _meta_end_dot_

 romney talked about the federal government s role in having businesses to buy equipment and create jobs _meta_end_dot_

 wallace asked romney about his _meta_dollor_ref_ billion federal bailout to the automobile industry and romney laughed not quite hillary s infamous cackle _meta_end_dot_

 he said that his _meta_dollor_ref_ billion federal bailout plan had nothing directly to do with the automobile industry _meta_end_dot_

 he wants the federal government to use taxpayer s money to invest in science explaining that we are already spending _meta_dollor_ref_ billion per year he merely wants to quadruple federal spending for science _meta_end_dot_

 he called it investing he said that where the federal government spends money we do well and federal spending for alternative energy sources will benefit all industry and give us economic independence _meta_end_dot_

 romney declared that this election was about changing washington he is the best to rebuild the economy a federal program because he has been in the economy in the private sector _meta_end_dot_

 he did not bridge the public private dichotomy _meta_end_dot_

 he said he is intimately familiar with how our economy works in the private sector yet he wants to spend taxpayer money public funds to direct the economy _meta_end_dot_

 wallace did not ask romney in which state he next hopes to be competitive _meta_end_dot_

 schumer on fns _meta_end_dot_

 if steph can have a dem named chuck on his show rangel i suppose it is good enough for wallace so enter chuckie schumer to talk about the democrats stimulus package for the recession many seem to want to happen _meta_end_dot_

 partisan fighting and dickering are only gonna make whatever kind of recession we have worse proclaimed chuckie _meta_end_dot_

 what if we have a super duper recession the kind which is immune to partisan fighting and dickering _meta_end_question_

 what if we do not have a recession _meta_end_question_

 i apologize for interrupting the sunday narrative schumer argued that we have to give money to people earning _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ who do not pay taxes because they are more likely to spend it than those who earn _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 chuckie said that they will extend welfare payments because doing so injects _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ into the economy for every _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ the federal government spends invests _meta_end_dot_

 he said that they will begin negotiating the package on tuesday in order to have it finished by march _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 he agreed that the president s stimulus package is about the right size most economists agree because _meta_dollor_ref_ billion is one percent of the gdp _meta_end_dot_

 what the two sides have to fight and dicker about it how the _meta_dollor_ref_ billion will be spent invested _meta_end_dot_

 he promised that the process will be bipartisan no all or nothing declarations _meta_end_dot_

 tim russert s panel _meta_end_dot_

 tim russert host of meet the press assembled his usual panel to talk about issues and political strategy former nbc anchor tom brokaw whose latest gig was pimping the _meta_number_ref_s presidential historian doris kearns goodwin whose last book i can remember dealt with the lincoln administration jon meacham editor of newsweek magazine who invents religions and takes michael isikoff at his word peggy noonan who needs no introduction and michele norris of npr _meta_end_dot_

 asked about the florida race for the gop brokaw said that it reminds him of dirt tracks in rural america _meta_end_dot_

 he added that republicans have given mccain a boost because they favor authenticity russert flipped up the cover of newsweek trumpeting a bit by michael gerson about how the gop has lost its way _meta_end_dot_

 it was a case of meacham paying a disgruntled ex bushie to write some tripe to attract lefties to his mag meacham agreed with gerson s feeble thesis that iraq was a lost cause associated with bush so the reagan coalition which became the bush coalition has come to an end as evidence he pointed to mitt romney whom he called the most establishment candidate in the republican field running against george bush s washington russert then began talking about the confederate flag _meta_end_dot_

 if any of you watched this nonsense in its entirety and can expound please do _meta_end_dot_

 edwards said that this was a factor what with the publicity those two attract but he s not making excuses he s speaking out for the middle class etc _meta_end_dot_

 schieffer pointed out that hillary won those voters in nevada _meta_end_dot_

 why cannot edwards get his message out _meta_end_question_

 edwards said that hillary spent massive amounts of money while he did not run a television ad _meta_end_dot_

 schieffer asked edwards if he were hanging around in hopes of a brokered convention as otherwise he ll have to win something _meta_end_dot_

 edwards said that it was a long process a lot of states to go go on for a while _meta_end_dot_

 edwards credited hillary and barry with running good campaigns _meta_end_dot_

 he characterized hillary as the washington dc candidate _meta_end_dot_

 he said that barry while advocating change was too academic to fight for it _meta_end_dot_

 schieffer said that hillary s peeps tell him that this will be wrapped up after super tuesday _meta_end_dot_

 edwards said that there were lots of states and the dems have to think of who they are going to put up against john mccain _meta_end_dot_

 he will be strong schieffer asked him if the race fight between hillary and barry were gone or was it coming back _meta_end_question_

 edwards said that it was unfortunate and that he had seen too much of such things when he was growing up in the south _meta_end_dot_

 edwards told schieffer that he s in it for the long haul david axelrod and howard wolfson on ftn _meta_end_dot_

 harold wolfson hillary s communication director said encouraging things about his candidate _meta_end_dot_

 david axelord chief strategist for barry said encouraging things about his candidate _meta_end_dot_

 bob schieffer listened attentively _meta_end_dot_

 they argued about which candidate would do well with the latino community despite the fact that one candidate threatened a lawsuit and the other ran a negative ad _meta_end_dot_

 they were griping spinning axelrod said barry s for change and he has been very specific about change he boasted that barry put the federal budget on google wolfson said that hillary is focusing resolutely on the economy stupid bob asked wolfson about bill what do you do with bill clinton from here on out wolfson wants him to keep doing what he s doing he s a huge headline grabber etc _meta_end_dot_

 axelrod said that bill clinton has become sort of their point man on making the negative case bad cop _meta_end_exclamation_

 whatcha gonna do when they come for you okay just when i m a little down about our prospective nominees the dems speak and it seems very plausible that they are our greatest hope _meta_end_dot_

 edwards on le _meta_end_dot_

 on cnn late edition host wolf blitzer first talked to john edwards pointing out that he d vastly outspent every other dem in south carolina _meta_end_dot_

 edwards said he should do well next saturday _meta_end_dot_

 he has no idea if he ll win _meta_end_dot_

 mitt romney spent the most in south carolina of republicans and he finished fourth in nevada edwards exclaimed i got my butt kicked yes he said butt on television and he said he hoped that t is true that what happens in vegas stays in vegas he said that hillary and barry did better than he did because they spent more time and money there _meta_end_dot_

 blitzer asked edwards why he would be better than hillary or barry at fighting a recession if we have one _meta_end_dot_

 he said that he has never taken any money from lobbyists and special interests and that the fight to give people federal money was personal to him _meta_end_dot_

 blitzer said that hillary asked for a _meta_number_ref_ day moratorium on foreclosures and a five year hold on interest rate increases _meta_end_dot_

 edwards said that s fine but he would go further allowing judges to restructure private sector loans and creating a fund to bail people out _meta_end_dot_

 blitzer played a clip of hillary declaring that the president has to be able to run the federal bureaucracy edwards argued that the fights of the next president will involve more than pushing paper around blitzer played a clip of barry saying that ronald reagan had changed america in ways richard nixon and bill clinton did not _meta_end_dot_

 edwards said that he would never use reagan as an example of change because the president helped big corporations and destroyed the environment _meta_end_dot_

 mitt romney on le _meta_end_dot_

 wolf next spoke to romney about south carolina and romney said that it was a nice state but was mccain huckabee country and he didn t need it _meta_end_dot_

 romney said that he would do real well in the south and was tied for the lead in florida _meta_end_dot_

 but the south he argued mattered less than who s gonna win in swing states like michigan and nevada _meta_end_dot_

 romney said that giuliani was a nice guy but no one has supported him so far _meta_end_dot_

 he said that he has spent his life in the private sector and knew the economy _meta_end_dot_

 romney said that mccain was a nice guy but has been in washington all his career and thus could not change washington _meta_end_dot_

 mitt boasted that he proposed a bailout stimulus package even larger than bush s because his experience is in the private sector and he knows how jobs are affected by what we do in washington his experience in the private sector has led him to the conclusion that the federal government can best create jobs the interview was brief and breathless _meta_end_dot_
