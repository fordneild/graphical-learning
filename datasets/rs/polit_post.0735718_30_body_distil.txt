  today s new york times comes out with an examination of the views of mitt romney and john edwards on the issue of wealth _meta_end_dot_

 romney is the candidate with the biggest personal fortune and edwards is probably only rivaled by hillary clinton whose husband went on a speechmaking for pay spree after he left the presidency _meta_end_dot_

 there views on wealth are telling and in one case edwards s entirely strange read on _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 edwards came from a relatively impoverished or struggling background and achieved his wealth both from his practice as a plaintiff s attorney and after his senate career was over as a member of a hedge fund making _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ a year for what was described as part time work edwards was also running his think tank on poverty issues at the university of north carolina _meta_end_dot_

 his rise came from a lot of hard work not a little talent when it came to operating in a courtroom and as the times article notes for both edwards and romney luck _meta_end_dot_

 in any event the once significantly poorer edwards has made quite a turnaround in his financial fortunes through his career path _meta_end_dot_

 romney came from greater wealth as his father was an executive at the american motors corporation _meta_end_dot_

 but romney made his personal fortune on his own and did it much in the same way that edwards made his fortune through lots of talent lots of hard work and again not a little luck as jefferson noted the harder one works the luckier one tends to get _meta_end_dot_

 i might doubt as i have in the past whether romney a very bright man is as intellectually engaged in politics as he was in business _meta_end_dot_

 but there is no doubting the fact that romney was indeed tremendously intellectually engaged in business and that degree of intellectual engagement helped win him the wealth he now has _meta_end_dot_

 these two life stories help buttress romney s argument that wealth is not a zero sum game _meta_end_dot_

 power especially political power may well be a zero sum game but wealth and economic prosperity is a different matter entirely _meta_end_dot_

 edwards could have gotten a lot of respect by pointing to his life story and making an optimist s argument to the electorate to the effect that if he could rise to the great financial heights he has achieved anyone could _meta_end_dot_

 sure he would probably segue from that into making claims regarding how big government would help in the effort but at the very least he would be speaking to people s hopes and not to their fears _meta_end_dot_

 instead he chooses to play the class warfare game and tell the electorate watch what i say and pay no attention whatsoever to the nature of my life story as i talk about wealth and prosperity distribution in america his own life story belies his populist claims and enhances romney s case _meta_end_dot_

 of course in discussing so complicated a matter we can and should go beyond mere life stories _meta_end_dot_

 but the nature of those life stories is not inconsequential _meta_end_dot_

 and in john edwards s case his life story helps undermine his very campaign _meta_end_dot_
