  ok let s walk through this one _meta_end_dot_

 the very short version and hat tip to gateway pundit for this obama s new political director patrick gaspard while national field director for the group america coming together used felons for gotv canvassing functions in the _meta_number_ref_ national election _meta_end_dot_

 his organization also ended up having to pay three quarters of a million dollars in fines excuse me civil penalties to get the fec off of their back for election finance rules violations _meta_end_dot_

 and very amusingly up until he got hired he was a registered and current lobbyist for _meta_number_ref_ seiu united healthcare workers east as well as being its executive vice president _meta_end_dot_

 did all of that get your attention _meta_end_question_

 excellent _meta_end_dot_

 read on _meta_end_dot_

 patrick gaspard was as noted above national field director for america coming together _meta_end_dot_

 some of the events that took place on his watch all bolding mine i will happily agree that there doesn t seem to be anything illegal about that sort of thing _meta_end_dot_

 i will even more happily point out that many deeply appallingly stupid things are legal in this country _meta_end_dot_

 but actual voter fraud is not the article notes that the culprits were probably gaspard s felons _meta_end_dot_

 presumably it was this kind of sloppy work that resulted in act getting spanked in _meta_number_ref_ but by then gaspard had started working for seiu by the time he was finally successfully headhunted by the obama campaign he was executive vice president for that union not to mention an active lobbyist _meta_end_dot_

 it s no real secret why obama wants him gaspard is apparently considered to be very good at ground operations _meta_end_dot_

 he was certainly good enough to help get nyc city councilmember mathieu eugene elected even after the first election had to be thrown out when it was discovered that mr _meta_end_dot_

 eugene didn t actually meet residency requirements _meta_end_dot_

 i need hardly note that the ohio and national gop organization is up in arms about the hire _meta_end_dot_

 at this point we probably have somebody jumping up and down pathetically eager to ask so what after all no laws were bro _meta_end_dot_

 ok some laws were apparently broken under gaspard s watch but neither he nor his group at the time ever actually had to admit to any wrongdoing _meta_end_dot_

 and politics ain t beanbag so absent an actual conviction the fact remains that this guy s apparently a heavy hitter with a skill set that obama could find useful which should be the most important consideration for the senator s campaign _meta_end_dot_

 so why bring it up now _meta_end_question_

 partisan politics of course but the problem is in this case politics that we re being partisan about involves clear ethical standards _meta_end_dot_

 senator barack obama is consciously and deliberately portraying himself as the outsider the reformer the fellow with the message of hope and change that we ve been waiting for take your pick _meta_end_dot_

 this is of course a lie he s actually a politico from the illinois combine who hires nyc machine street monsters with flexible ethics to run his ground game _meta_end_dot_

 here s the thing he s allowed to do that _meta_end_dot_

 he s allowed to lie to his supporters _meta_end_dot_

 he s allowed to be a hypocrite _meta_end_dot_

 but over the last few days i ve generally seen two types of responses among obama s supporters with regard to his betrayal of them over both fisa and public financing shocked disbelief that the master who loved them and who would never harm them has betrayed their trust and hasty revisionism that well of course nobody ever really believed all that hype about senator obama in the first place perish the thought it was all made up by the right _meta_end_dot_

 to the first group i would like to thank them for reaffirming my low opinion of their collective intelligence to the second i suggest that they don t assume that we re as dumb as the first group _meta_end_dot_

 you people really did believe the hype and you really shouldn t have _meta_end_dot_

 really _meta_end_question_

 _meta_number_ref_ million dollars argues otherwise _meta_end_dot_

 unless you want to claim that it was all one big credit card scam _meta_end_question_
