  i know pejman addressed this in his rant but mitt romney s comment in michigan struck a major nerve in my conservative spinal column and i m still gobsmacked about the following words that came out of mitt romney s mouth more below the fold _meta_end_dot_

 a comment like this should hurt conservative ears like fingernails to a chalkboard _meta_end_dot_

 to put it bluntly such a proposal is raw unfiltered liberalism _meta_end_dot_

 folks born after _meta_number_ref_ won t remember this firsthand but back in the _meta_number_ref_s and _meta_number_ref_s liberal democrats and liberal media and labor union leaders consistently lamented the lack of a federal industrial policy citing the success story of japan and its emerging economic powerhouse as exhibit a _meta_end_dot_

 despite the real economic pains felt in the rust belt ronald reagan and fellow conservatives resisted the clamor with chrysler being a reagan exception saying that the federal government should not be in the business of further insinuating itself into the private sector and should not be in the business of picking economic winners and losers _meta_end_dot_

 we said that such a move would not improve efficiency and productivity and it would stifle creativity in our free market economy _meta_end_dot_

 we argued that the most creative sectors were the least regulated and least subsidized sectors citing the brand new personal computer industry and software innovators such as microsoft _meta_end_dot_

 we said that this form of corporate welfare would unfairly reward and prop up companies that should stand on their own and adapt to an ever changing economic environment _meta_end_dot_

 thankfully the argument went south when the japanese economy went south exposing the fundamentally flawed policy for what it was _meta_end_dot_

 the concept of a federal industrial policy was tossed in the dustbin of history or at least i thought it was lodged somewhere between communism and that stack of old huey lewis the news records _meta_end_dot_

 yet here we are in the _meta_number_ref_st century _meta_number_ref_ years after a pitiful argument died hearing mitt romney a republican no less trying to resurrect this dinosaur of a idea in a pitched primary race _meta_end_dot_

 i may very well have a bias here but i believe that i would be just as repulsed by this stupid idea no matter who i supported _meta_end_dot_
