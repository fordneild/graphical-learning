  this little gem from the french foreign minister hunh _meta_end_dot_

 can someone help me understand how we square this notion of i want obama to win so we can see america adopt the long standing french tradition of negotiating with their enemies so they can have their sorry butts handed to them with sarkozy s idea that from the very beginning the american dream meant proving to all mankind that freedom justice human rights and democracy were no utopia but were rather the most realistic policy there is and the most likely to improve the fate of each and every person sarkozy s france recalls and reaffirms that we have and will continue to spill blood together wherever and whenever it is required to keep us secure and ensure our liberty _meta_end_dot_

 his foreign minister seems to live in some alternate france _meta_end_dot_

 i admit i am at a loss as to which france to believe and which one can be trusted sarkozy s or kouchner s _meta_end_dot_

 given their actions since the run up to iraq i m inclined to believe kouchner s version _meta_end_dot_

 sarkozy perhaps can re establish the image of franco american relations of the bygone days we ll see _meta_end_dot_

 more below the fold _meta_end_dot_

 sarkozy continues i consider this to be america s magic _meta_end_dot_

 kouchner however seems to think that president bush has single handedly destroyed it somehow _meta_end_dot_

 if the french didn t take themselves so seriously i might just laugh this guy off but as a voting member of the un security council this nonsense is paid attention to around the world and words from little men in big suits matter _meta_end_dot_

 and they are greeted with cheers and knowing nods and sighs of relief by the whole of the international community including those enemies awaiting the right opportunity to take their own shot at us and france and england and any number of other countries trying to live the american dream or aspire to have a little piece of something like it for themselves _meta_end_dot_

 france has a fairly long history of capitulation cut losses wherever possible and give in as much as necessary to avoid conflict and confrontation _meta_end_dot_

 beyond our revolution and a few conficts not too long afterwards it has been the us that has had to come to the aid and rescue of our french friends _meta_end_dot_

 it has been our magic that has plucked them from the ashes dusted their sorry butts off and helped them rise to their feet again _meta_end_dot_

 i don t think kouchner is in any position to assess the state of the american dream given the state of the french dream but he only adds to the hopes of our mutual enemies when he suggests we are never going to be like we once were _meta_end_dot_

 umm bernie _meta_end_question_

 we haven t changed over here in the good ol us of a _meta_end_dot_

 we re still killing bad guys and we re still willing to do so even without their permission or yours or anyone else s for that matter _meta_end_dot_

 ya might want to re think this one pal _meta_end_dot_

 where are you going to go the next time you re in a tight spot iran _meta_end_question_

 russia _meta_end_question_

 maybe china will rush in and prop you back up after you fall on your face again _meta_end_dot_
