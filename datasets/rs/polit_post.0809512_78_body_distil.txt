  on the whole the mainstream media is so bedazzled with barack obama that it won t do its job in holding the illinois senator accountable to his words _meta_end_dot_

 that job is left to the fact checkers the blogs and friends of hillary and bill _meta_end_dot_

 no wonder bill clinton is so angry _meta_end_dot_

 obama s getting away with it and team clinton is not _meta_end_dot_

 when obama started his campaign he promised a new kind of politics but what we ve actually seen especially in the last month is a growing pile of old style untruths _meta_end_dot_

 instead of a new way we re getting the chicago way _meta_end_dot_

 let s recap more below the fold _meta_end_dot_

 the _meta_number_ref_ year war _meta_end_dot_

 this the columbia journalism review makes the harsh assessment that obama is seriously misleading voters if not outright lying to them about exactly what mccain said michael dobbs fact checker site is less harsh but comes to a similar conclusion _meta_end_dot_

 here s what mccain actually said _meta_end_dot_

 for obama to be honest about mccain s statement the democratic frontrunner must also believe that we re still at war in germany japan and korea _meta_end_dot_

 this is what a senior obama advisor called a clean shot against mccain _meta_end_dot_

 that was a clean shot _meta_end_question_

 i d like to see they consider a dirty shot _meta_end_dot_

 obama s jfk selma connection _meta_end_dot_

 obama s own words the fact checker concludes that obama s words are misleading in a number of ways obama earned three pinocchios for this one because of significant factual errors and or obvious contradictions _meta_end_dot_

 obama and his taking of money from oil companies _meta_end_dot_

 this statement too slick their conclusion obama masking his liberalism _meta_end_dot_

 the politico as ed morrisey notes the obama team s response makes no sense _meta_end_dot_

 barack obama is trying to package himself as a transcendant candidate who can cross party lines for change but the sad fact is that his views are left and liberal and he has the most liberal _meta_number_ref_ voting record in the u s _meta_end_dot_

 senate _meta_end_dot_

 someone needs to explain to me how a person on the far left can convince people on the right that their views are wrong and that they must join him to bring about hope and change _meta_end_dot_

 seems like someone more centrist cough mccain could do a better job of it _meta_end_dot_

 a mccain presidency would be a bush third term on energy _meta_end_question_

 this obama s statement is dishonest because it is so disingenuous _meta_end_dot_

 when it came to the _meta_number_ref_ energy bill the senate voted _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ in favor _meta_end_dot_

 according to jake tapper obama voted yea and mccain voted nay _meta_end_dot_

 whose vote is closer to a bush third term _meta_end_question_

 it looks to me like obama s _meta_end_dot_

 president bush has been pushing for drilling in anwr since his first term _meta_end_dot_

 to the chagrin of most republicans mccain is opposed _meta_end_dot_

 mccain s energy security plan is significantly different from the bush version _meta_end_dot_

 obama on his pastor s acknowledgment _meta_end_dot_

 ap obama said this there is no record anywhere of reverend wright making any such acknowledgement cite _meta_end_dot_

 obama s anti nafta mailer _meta_end_dot_

 factcheck org all of this dishonesty has happened in the last month or so _meta_end_dot_

 how much more can we expect in a head to head contest _meta_end_question_

 why is obama getting a relatively free pass from the mainstream press _meta_end_question_

 when will the mainstream media step in and start doing its job _meta_end_question_

 the bets are on _meta_end_dot_
