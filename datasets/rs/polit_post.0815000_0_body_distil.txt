  the spring of pain is well on its way to becoming the summer of weasels gnawing on entrails for the democratic party and may i be the first to congratulate them for it _meta_end_question_

 there s a bit of lopsidedness to the general election results so far you see and guess what _meta_end_question_

 it s all about the swing states baby _meta_end_dot_

 read on _meta_end_dot_

 read the whole survey but let me extract some of the meat for you here the really important issue is what gallup s swing states are doing _meta_end_dot_

 gallup defines hillary s swing states as being arkansas florida michigan nevada pennsylvania ohio new hampshire and new mexico and barack s as being colorado iowa minnesota missouri oregon and wisconsin _meta_end_dot_

 while they both do equally well against mccain in their own swing states and about equally badly in their primary opponent s swing states there s one small problem for obama the evs of clinton s swing states totals _meta_number_ref_ while his swing states evs equal _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 even taking out florida and michigan the ratio is _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 to put this into perspective i will right this moment make a deal with the obama campaign _meta_end_dot_

 i will spot them the evs of colorado iowa minnesota missouri oregon and wisconsin in exchange for those of arkansas nevada pennsylvania ohio new hampshire and new mexico _meta_end_dot_

 note that i m not even insisting on florida and michigan we can fight for those states normally heck we can even agree that we keep florida and they can keep michigan _meta_end_dot_

 more than fair right _meta_end_question_

 given that i m giving up _meta_number_ref_ evs from _meta_number_ref_ and everything _meta_end_dot_

 and that above scenario is the reason that i m suggesting you invest in antacid vendors _meta_end_dot_

 the central problem here for the democrats is that their current front runner is an inexperienced liberal peacenik _meta_end_dot_

 the united states of america does not elect liberal peaceniks president the inexperienced part is merely a garnish _meta_end_dot_

 if they go with the person that actually has a shot she probably will pick up most of the front runner s supporters _meta_end_dot_

 after they re done screaming ranting raving and throwing things for a while _meta_end_dot_

 but said supporters will be absolutely disinclined to do anything but vote _meta_end_dot_

 which is a problem given that the dnc is hurting for cash right now _meta_end_dot_

 and god forbid that the establishment democrats eventual choice of a candidate loses the general election they ll be hunting party officials through the halls with pitchforks and torches _meta_end_dot_

 so what s the solution _meta_end_question_

 i told you maalox _meta_end_dot_

 or maybe a time machine _meta_end_dot_

 moe lane it sounded better in my head than it looked on the screen sorry _meta_end_dot_
