  a new round of israeli arab peace talks is under way _meta_end_dot_

 whether something enduring will come of it seems rather unlikely though even some normally skeptical observers have expressed guarded hope _meta_end_dot_

 there is one curiosity here worth expounding thanks to jimmy carter you ll probably need both your hands to count the number of times the charge of apartheid will be hurled against israel sometimes with the esteemed former president actually cited during interviews of arab pr men _meta_end_dot_

 apartheid system apartheid regime apartheid state apartheid government possibly even the infelicitous phrase apartheid occupation over and over and over these guys are suckers repetition of striking phrases _meta_end_dot_

 and while we ve heard the apartheid accusation before it is carter s recent book has vastly increased its currency _meta_end_dot_

 read on _meta_end_dot_

 the curiosity is this since in liberal parlance apartheid has become a mere synonym for discrimination which is the most wicked of all things there is a certain logic to this charge _meta_end_dot_

 if a state that discriminates is an apartheid state why then israel is an apartheid state _meta_end_dot_

 not being a liberal myself i have nothing against discrimination in principle and indeed believe that a population which has for decades incubated a long train of depraved terrorists as palestine has richly deserves considerable and unapologetic discrimination _meta_end_dot_

 further i am on record repeatedly here at redstate and elsewhere in calling for various policies of open discrimination against the islamic religion precisely for its incubation of a much longer train of depraved terrorists brigands and mad revolutionaries _meta_end_dot_

 i have no illusions about what i m up against here _meta_end_dot_

 the principle of nondiscrimination is the very god of liberalism _meta_end_dot_

 and it is alas a solid fact that a great many self styled conservatives do not hesitate to genuflect before this jealous god _meta_end_dot_

 one of my cobloggers at another website calls such men right liberals _meta_end_dot_

 right liberalism grants the normative status of nondiscrimination but makes a big scene about critiquing its excesses _meta_end_dot_

 the posture is inherently problematic as the right liberal is always vulnerable to the left liberal raising the stakes _meta_end_dot_

 and in many cases right liberals have been so outmaneuvered by their cousins further left that they become the mere consolidators of leftism _meta_end_dot_

 but there is nothing inherently virtuous in nondiscrimination _meta_end_dot_

 there is nothing inherently wicked in discrimination _meta_end_dot_

 at the level of abstraction there is really not much we can say about it _meta_end_dot_

 we need particulars in order to judge properly and judging properly is in truth another phrase for the mental process of discrimination is it unjust to discriminate against job applicants purely on the basis of race _meta_end_question_

 yes i believe it is _meta_end_dot_

 is it unjust to discriminate against job applicants on the basis of criminal record _meta_end_question_

 clearly not _meta_end_dot_

 is it unjust to discriminate against potential immigrants on the basis of religion or national origin _meta_end_question_

 on the basis of education level _meta_end_question_

 on the basis of professional skills _meta_end_question_

 in short on the question of discrimination there is no universal unequivocal answer _meta_end_dot_

 some kinds of it are plainly unjust others are wise and good _meta_end_dot_

 it is the task of self government to work out the particulars _meta_end_dot_

 in a republic like ours all we can demand is that men bring their own particular experiences their capacity for reason and their patriotic good will to the discussion table _meta_end_dot_

 there is certainly some unjust and brutal discrimination against palestinians by israelis _meta_end_dot_

 no one will deny that _meta_end_dot_

 but there is also some very wise discrimination _meta_end_dot_

 it will only be removed when the latter begin to trust that the former are not perpetuating a whole culture of murderous terror against them _meta_end_dot_

 and the folly of liberalism exemplified by former president carter is to sweep away all these distinctions leaving only the absurd conclusion that because israel discriminates she must be an apartheid state that is an illegitimate and brazen affront to liberalism _meta_end_dot_

 this logic of nondiscrimination will issue in the dissolution of all western nations israel included because to maintain a western nation means strictly speaking to discriminate in favor of western things at the expense of non western things _meta_end_dot_
