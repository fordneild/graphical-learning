  first it was moveon org votevets org and the center for american progress vowing to spend _meta_dollor_ref_ million in ads to take down mccain _meta_end_dot_

 now it s afl cio the nation s largest labor union organization to the tune of _meta_dollor_ref_ million _meta_end_dot_

 according to the wall street journal the mccain revealed campaign will paint mccain as anti worker and to tie him to the economic policies of president bush the record _meta_dollor_ref_ million spent by afl cio to elect a democrat could be significantly influential because the organization reaches a massive number of voters directly in accordance with their _meta_number_ref_ million members _meta_end_dot_

 members of different unions will receive anti mccain information specific to their professions _meta_end_dot_

 afl cio did not endorse either democrat candidate but members are said to be split between favoring barack obama or hillary clinton _meta_end_dot_

 so long as it s not john mccain is their message _meta_end_dot_

 it rings true the reality that obama and clinton differ little when it comes to their policies on unions healthcare foreign policy or budgeting _meta_end_dot_

 even though many conservatives despise the mccain candidacy he still provides a strong contrast to his ultra liberal opponents _meta_end_dot_

 according to the swamp blog at a press conference yesterday president john sweeney called it a non partisan effort more than once but that s a real laugh _meta_end_dot_

 according to the cq money line website subscription required _meta_percent_ref_ of the group s contributions in _meta_number_ref_ went to democrat candidates and causes _meta_end_dot_

 so it s clear afl cio is bein its normal shady self but there s a trend in the past that seems to work republicans have always had less money than democrats in elections and fundraising but it s our principle and truth that are priceless _meta_end_dot_
