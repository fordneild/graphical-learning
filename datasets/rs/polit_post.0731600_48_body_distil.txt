  i owe this day very much to the veterans of our country _meta_end_dot_

 to the _meta_number_ref_ year old kid who just got back from a year in afghanistan to the _meta_number_ref_ year old world war two vet in a wheelchair in nebraska _meta_end_dot_

 most especially to the ones who lost their lives who paid for our freedom for standing by america and making so much possible _meta_end_dot_

 america endures and provides hope to so many across the globe _meta_end_dot_

 but that survival would be impossible without those who hold us up with their combat boots iron discipline and fierce dedication to something greater _meta_end_dot_

 they exist for something more _meta_end_dot_

 they are the beginning of what has become known as paying it forward continue reading below i absolutely loved this day _meta_end_dot_

 the air was perfect for a crispy november with sunlight dripping off the orange and crimson leaves bleeding patches of light onto the rock creek park trail floor behind my house _meta_end_dot_

 i drove among rows of three story white houses with black shutters and past a middle school sports team practice _meta_end_dot_

 i drank a steamy starbucks vanilla latte had sunday morning girl talk with my friends and scrubbed my bathroom floors _meta_end_dot_

 this is a sunday of freedom _meta_end_dot_

 my dad called me two weeks ago and said i have an american hero mowing my lawn right now our friend jeff a _meta_number_ref_ year old army officer had just returned from a year in iraq _meta_end_dot_

 he was back doing his old jobs mowing lawns for the family business returning to life as it was but he would never be the same _meta_end_dot_

 we haven t spoken much since he got back but he is different by his own admission the reality of war altered his being forever _meta_end_dot_

 i don t think a day went by that i didn t think of jeff risking his life in iraq _meta_end_dot_

 i sure thank god that he s home to his mom to his fianc to his country _meta_end_dot_

 i have another friend gearing up to head over to iraq next month _meta_end_dot_

 he is scared but he is making life as we know it possible _meta_end_dot_

 on a recent trip i sat next to a marine in his uniform with printed bags and combat boots _meta_end_dot_

 whenever i pass a soldier i feel as if i m near living breathing honor _meta_end_dot_

 no celebrity meeting could compare to shaking hands with a man or woman in the us military _meta_end_dot_

 i spoke to this marine and asked him if he had yet been overseas _meta_end_dot_

 he laughed with friendly eyes and said he just returned from his seventh trip _meta_end_dot_

 i ll keep going back till they don t need me anymore he said _meta_end_dot_

 wow _meta_end_dot_

 we talked a little light politics and though he never revealed where he stood on that end it didn t seem to matter _meta_end_dot_

 we have a job to do he told me _meta_end_dot_

 my plane was called i wished him good luck and said thank you _meta_end_dot_

 i wrote an article on friday for human events in tribute to the anniversary of the us marine corps _meta_end_dot_

 the responses of appreciation i received were amazing _meta_end_dot_

 most of the emails and comments came from former marines who have been deployed all over the world _meta_end_dot_

 they were as young as _meta_number_ref_ and as old as far as i could tell as _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 these men and women were so grateful to have their branch a significant part of their identities recognized and appreciated _meta_end_dot_

 to those men and women i say no thank you _meta_end_dot_

 when i tell a soldier thank you it seems such a pitiful gesture in response to the great action they perform _meta_end_dot_

 i feel like i am offering an acorn in exchange for an entire forest _meta_end_dot_

 nevertheless the thank yous must come often _meta_end_dot_

 the war is personal to us all _meta_end_dot_

 we all have friends and family husbands and wives brothers and sisters someone who has been over there this time around _meta_end_dot_

 when your not in it it s sometimes easy to forget its happening _meta_end_dot_

 skip the news forget the paper slink around in your own little jaded bubble _meta_end_dot_

 but we can t _meta_end_dot_

 to the many veterans and active duty soldiers and marines and sailors i know and to the ones i ve never met we owe you more than we can ever give back _meta_end_dot_

 thank you for your sacrifice and your bravery and the character you show to help humanity carry on in a world that sometimes feels hopeless _meta_end_dot_

 today is your day but you deserve all _meta_number_ref_ of them _meta_end_dot_

 as one of my favorite bible verses reads surely goodness and mercy will follow you all the days of your life that is my prayer for each of you _meta_end_dot_
