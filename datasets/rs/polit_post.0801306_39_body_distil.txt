  briefly noted this followup to my piece posted here on the parliamentary elections held today in taiwan _meta_end_dot_

 the opposition kuomintang kmt party did very well as expected picking up _meta_number_ref_ seats out of _meta_number_ref_ in a smaller reorganized legislature _meta_end_dot_

 the outcome portends a similar result in taiwan s presidential election to be held on march _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 with this vote the taiwanese have strongly endorsed the kmt s long stated desire for closer business and financial relations with the people s republic of china _meta_end_dot_

 more _meta_end_dot_

 as i pointed out the other day taiwan has had divided government since _meta_number_ref_ with the kmt controlling the legislature and the democratic progressive party dpp holding the presidency _meta_end_dot_

 this division which is blamed by many taiwanese for the island economy s relative underperformance now looks set to end _meta_end_dot_

 after today s vote expectations are even stronger that the kmt s leader ma ying jeou will be elected president in march _meta_end_dot_

 the kmt is the modern remnant of the party of sun yat sen and chiang kai shek _meta_end_dot_

 in terms of taiwan s politics they have always favored closer integration with the prc _meta_end_dot_

 their rivals the dpp have instead long stressed taiwan s sovereignty and independence _meta_end_dot_

 while in power the dpp have sought to forge diplomatic relations with several small countries notably costa rica and have tried to organize a quixotic drive to join the united nations _meta_end_dot_

 when i made these points the other day our respected commenter skanderbeg pointed out that the kmt and presumably their voters are not interested in a political rapprochement with the communist regime which itself can hardly be called maoist any more _meta_end_dot_

 rather he believes that the kmt want to displace the communists and return to their former position as the ruling party in beijing _meta_end_dot_

 even if this is true i don t accept that it s anything more than atmospherics _meta_end_dot_

 in any case the fact remains that the kmt platform stresses closer business and financial integration with mainland china and also that the people have now overwhelmingly voted for more of this _meta_end_dot_

 note this illuminating remark from a man identified as a bus driver in the bloomberg piece i linked above give this some careful thought _meta_end_dot_

 of course the taiwanese want the status quo which in a word means freedom _meta_end_dot_

 but they also want to participate in the much more rapid economic growth that china is experiencing _meta_end_dot_

 it s by no means clear that they can have both _meta_end_dot_

 and it s far too much for the people of taiwan to expect the united states to continue to guarantee their independence while they forge closer and closer relationships with the regime against which they would have us go to war _meta_end_dot_

 it bears repeating that the taiwanese feel the gravitational pull of their ethnic ties to the mainland chinese and that this may ultimately draw the island nation back into reunification with the mainland _meta_end_dot_

 their desire to fully participate in the greatest and fastest economic boom in world history may trump their love and their very brief history of freedom and independence _meta_end_dot_

 this would most certainly be a defeat for the united states considered in terms of traditional cold war foreign policy _meta_end_dot_

 but no one in either us political party or in any other institution has articulated a coherent foreign policy for the _meta_number_ref_st century that clearly identifies our interests and objectives in east asia _meta_end_dot_

 so it s impossible to say whether the integration of taiwan into the prc is in fact a defeat for us in terms that are relevant today _meta_end_dot_

 the gwot is now the only thing we have that even superficially resembles a foreign policy but it s largely silent on questions pertaining to east asia _meta_end_dot_

 and in any case the gwot will not survive the current administration under any plausible scenario for our elections this november _meta_end_dot_

 if we may take hillary clinton at her always oblique and carefully hedged word as president she would concentrate on bringing socialism to the united states _meta_end_dot_

 presumably she d ignore foreign policy and leave it to someone like richard holbrooke _meta_end_dot_

 if barack obama becomes president on the other hand it might be wise for you to start learning chinese _meta_end_dot_

 we d better get ourselves a foreign policy _meta_end_dot_

 and soon _meta_end_dot_
