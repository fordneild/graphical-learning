  a rather funny parody on the american thinker blog suggests that howard dean simultaneously nominate both hillary rodham clinton and barack obama for president one for each of john edwards two america s _meta_end_dot_

 that was before clarice feldman went on to recommend that jimmy carter certify the primary results because it worked so well for hugo chavez _meta_end_dot_

 this made me stop laughing _meta_end_dot_

 a harmonic convergence between today s gas prices and any prominent role played by jimmy carter could lead to a spontaneous comeback album by the average white bandand bee gees nite on american idol _meta_end_dot_

 what it also got me to thinking was what ever happened to good old playstation johnny _meta_end_question_

 does either america really care that this up jumped tort malefactor still exists _meta_end_question_

 he does have _meta_number_ref_ delegates and a certain cache amongst the dems as a losing veep candidate _meta_end_dot_

 then again geraldine ferraro and joe lieberman haven t fared well amongst the party faithful in recent years _meta_end_dot_

 perhaps what john edwards really still has are those _meta_number_ref_ delegates _meta_end_dot_

 it doesn t sound like much it could be fewer than what either barack obama or hillary rodham clinton need to clinch the nomination without a floor fight _meta_number_ref_ mile above mean sea level in beautiful denver colorado _meta_end_dot_

 however this year s nomination fight is such a pyrrhic battle of the somme that _meta_number_ref_ delegates could be the straw that finally breaks the back of the other guy s camel _meta_end_dot_

 thus as he has enjoyed for much of his questionable existence john edwards enjoys far more influence and leverage than anything on his resume or in his character would genuinely merit _meta_end_dot_

 as distasteful as both barack and hillary may find it they do have to at least act like they care about good old john edwards or in j macian parlance their friend john edwards _meta_end_dot_

 oh and the north carolina primary will also take place soon _meta_end_dot_

 make that the neck and neck north carolina primary _meta_end_dot_

 reverend jeremiah wright certainly has _meta_end_dot_

 either candidate could get a needed five point ketchup spurt in the polls by getting the king of torts on board either of their increasingly dysfunctional blandwagons _meta_end_dot_

 thus for the nonce john edwards still won t be returning rielle hunter s phone calls rather than vice versa _meta_end_dot_

 prince john can certainly expect both hillary and barack to come a courting _meta_end_dot_

 the fact that they both obviously snicker behind their hand at the pretentious fop will be conveniently forgotten _meta_end_dot_

 read on _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 thus if john edwards wants to set himself up with a cabinet position a court appointment or just a more comfortable standard of living than either midas or croesus the time has come for him to loudly hawk his pathetic and dilapidated wares _meta_end_dot_

 at no point in this man s future timeline will his dubious services be in as much demand as they are in the run up to the north carolina primary _meta_end_dot_

 let the bidding for his endorsement commence _meta_end_dot_

 if i am wrong and no one wants to visit his palatial mansion i will have overrated him as badly as the people in north carolina who elected him to the us senate _meta_end_dot_
