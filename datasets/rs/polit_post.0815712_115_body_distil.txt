  my preacher from back home in louisiana once wrote a book entitled be sure what you believe _meta_end_dot_

 many people believe many things but there is really only one truth _meta_end_dot_

 in the case of the iranian revolutionary guard there is only one truth _meta_end_dot_

 the organization is a terrorist organization _meta_end_dot_

 objectively they are a terrorist organization _meta_end_dot_

 the revolutionary guard functions as much to defend iran through normal military means as it does to surreptitiously terrorize israel the united states and other enemies of the islamic republic _meta_end_dot_

 in october _meta_number_ref_ the united states senate considered the kyl lieberman legislation that would designate the iranian revolutionary guard a terrorist organization _meta_end_dot_

 the senior senator from illinois dick durbin saw no way that the law could be used as a pretense to launch an invasion of iran the junior senator barack obama thought otherwise saying the bush administration could use the language in lieberman kyl to justify an attack on iran as a part of the ongoing war in iraq h t to jim geraghty senator joseph lieberman to alleviate all the concerns about a pretense for attack removed language some senators objected to _meta_end_dot_

 the legislation passed with _meta_number_ref_ of _meta_number_ref_ senators supporting it _meta_end_dot_

 barack obama voted against it _meta_end_dot_

 yesterday barack obama told aipac that the iranian revolutionary guard should be a designated terrorist organization _meta_end_dot_

 this comes on the heels of polls showing obama has a problem with jewish voters _meta_end_dot_

 and it is no wonder _meta_end_dot_

 less than a month ago obama said he did not think iran was a threat _meta_end_dot_

 he only ran in the opposite direction after right wing bloggers called him out _meta_end_dot_

 and now again once the mccain camp and righ wing bloggers dinged obama for his views on the iranian revolutionary guard obama ran in the opposite direction to ingratiate himself to a group _meta_end_dot_

 to quote senator obama himself just words it is apparent senator obama is not sure what he believes _meta_end_dot_

 if he is willing to cave so fast when the right wing hits him how much faster is he going to cave to iran china and our other enemies _meta_end_question_
