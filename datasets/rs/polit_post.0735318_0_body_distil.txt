  while the specifics of the gop s devastating _meta_number_ref_ electoral loss can and will be argued forever there is one point which is in arguable the republican party s willing forfeiture of its claim to being the party of fiscal conservatism and of open and ethical government was a major factor in costing it the congressional majority _meta_end_dot_

 one egregious example of republican deceit and irresponsibility during the party s final session in power was committed by alaska rep _meta_end_dot_

 don young r ak _meta_end_dot_

 young then the chairman of the transportation committee altered an earmark he had inserted in the _meta_number_ref_ transportation bill after that bill had been passed congress changing the text of the bill itself and the location of the program that his earmark had funded to take _meta_dollor_ref_ million in government funds from a project local officials wanted and to redirect the funds to a project opposed by those same local officials but which provided direct benefit to a high dollar campaign contributor a real estate mogul who had thrown a _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ fundraiser for young that year this august talking points memo reported that of the _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ earmarks in the _meta_number_ref_ page bill in question young s had been the only to undergo such a change as _meta_number_ref_ draws to a close the senate is considering a bill which would make several changes to that _meta_number_ref_ transportation legislation including reversing rep _meta_end_dot_

 young s ex post facto earmark modification to the form in which it was originally passed by the congress two years ago _meta_end_dot_

 the senate hoped to simply pass the bill unanimous consent yesterday though sen _meta_end_dot_

 tom coburn r ok sent a letter to senate minority leader mitch mcconnell stating his object ion to unanimous passage of any bill providing technical corrections of the _meta_number_ref_ highway bill unless the legislation authorizing those corrections also require s a full and open investigation into rep _meta_end_dot_

 young s deceitful action _meta_end_dot_

 wrote coburn for very good reason as senator trainwreck is absolutely correct on this matter _meta_end_dot_

 while many republicans have performed admirably after being thrust into the congressional minority there remain too few signs that those who represent our party in elective office understand why it is that they were defeated one year ago _meta_end_dot_

 if we are to seriously promote a reduction in the waste and corruption which have become hallmarks of our federal government we must tend to our own house first _meta_end_dot_

 much like rubber stamping wasteful spending bills and continuing to turn a blind eye to party members known to be corrupt allowing an act like that committed by rep _meta_end_dot_

 young to simply be swept under the rug and never talked about again is absolutely unacceptable _meta_end_dot_

 the opposition party offers innumerable opportunities to point out hypocrisy corruption ulterior motives and ethical lapses _meta_end_dot_

 however if we cannot or will not police our own side then we leave ourselves very poor footing from which to expose and exploit the other side s faults _meta_end_dot_

 senator coburn is absolutely correct to demand an investigation into rep _meta_end_dot_

 young s action _meta_end_dot_

 we applaud his decision to make a stand on this issue and we strongly encourage the congressional republican leadership to follow his advice _meta_end_dot_

 rep _meta_end_dot_

 young s actions must be fully investigated and if guilty of an infraction he must be dealt with _meta_end_dot_

 it is only by learning one of the major lessons of _meta_number_ref_ and ridding ourselves of those republicans who lack the integrity and the commitment to honest responsible governance that the gop can regain its moral and ethical authority and once again deserve a position of supremacy in the united states congress _meta_end_dot_

 senator coburn has recognized this and is standing up for the gop s true values _meta_end_dot_

 we call upon the rest of the republican caucus in washington to join him _meta_end_dot_
