  according to a just released field poll the proposed _meta_dollor_ref_b california government health insurance expansion which would be built on the backs of smokers _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ to _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ a pack increase business owners in the state _meta_percent_ref_ to _meta_percent_ref_ payroll tax increase and hospitals _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_b in additional state taxes is overwhelmingly supported by california voters including republicans _meta_end_dot_

 read on _meta_end_dot_

 according to the san francisco chronicle according to the sacramento bee a new _meta_dollor_ref_b government program is rarely a good idea regardless of the circumstances _meta_end_dot_

 a new _meta_dollor_ref_b government program in the state ranked _meta_number_ref_th best in the nation for business which leans on businesses to make up a great deal of the program cost is a terrible idea _meta_end_dot_

 doing so while running a _meta_dollor_ref_b state deficit is even more foolish _meta_end_dot_

 if this field poll is even close to being correct it appears that the people of california are ready and willing to go along with that foolishness _meta_end_dot_

 when their cigarettes are _meta_dollor_ref_ per pack their hospital bills are steeper than ever and their jobs are exported to nevada the _meta_number_ref_rd ranked state for business in the us then perhaps all of those who supported this program will finally realize that in the end they actually had to pay for that which they thought was being given them for free _meta_end_dot_

 perhaps _meta_end_dot_

 but i wouldn t advise holding your breath _meta_end_dot_
