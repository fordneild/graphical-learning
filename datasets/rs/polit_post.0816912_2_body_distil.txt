  one of the more prevalent memes concerning barack obama revolves around the argument that despite his political leanings he is actually something of a burkean candidate one given to a sense of temperance and caution that oftentimes is not found in his fellow democrats _meta_end_dot_

 specifically the argument is that because obama was a law lecturer for so long at the university of chicago and was therefore surrounded by conservative and libertarian law professors including a number from the famed law and economics set who propounded visions and arguments concerning the free market that one does not usually find in the platform of the democratic party obama learned to sharpen and hone his arguments for his own ideology and he also might have gained an appreciation and a healthy respect for the arguments of conservatives and libertarians _meta_end_dot_

 andrew sullivan comme d habitude at his blog gives voice to this meme by citing obama s phone call to university of chicago law professor and soon to be harvard law professor cass sunstein concerning the bush administration s warrantless surveillance of international phone calls between americans and suspected terrorists overseas _meta_end_dot_

 through sunstein s account of the phone call we learn that perestroika sweeping the american political landscape jonah goldberg provides some much needed perspective and he can show those qualities when it comes to the issue of iraq _meta_end_dot_

 robert kaplan has some information regarding iraq that the supposedly burkean chicagoan senator from illinois should pay careful attention to and which should in a world where the image of the burkean chicagoan obama actually corresponds with reality cause obama to fundamentally change and alter his iraq policy _meta_end_dot_

 a sample of kaplan s apt and important findings chicagoan obama can do the same or at the very least consider seriously doing the same no _meta_end_question_

 the impetus for changing obama s position on iraq is furthered by this economist article on the state of affairs in iraq and how dramatically life there has improved _meta_end_dot_

 to be sure as brother soren has wisely noted we are not out of the woods yet _meta_end_dot_

 but there is no denying the improvement economist does not offer undiluted praise _meta_end_dot_

 not by a long shot _meta_end_dot_

 but it does offer at the very end of its piece the following if america s next president gets iraq wrong because he has boxed himself in during the campaign all the recent gains may be squandered and iraq will slide swiftly back into misery and despair _meta_end_dot_

 that would be to fail twice over it s advice offered for both candidates but presumably the burkean temperate measured intellectually open chicagoan obama is primed to take it _meta_end_dot_

 that is of course if senator obama is indeed burkean temperate measured intellectually open and genuinely influenced by his time at the university of chicago to accept and understand that the other side of the partisan and ideological divide relative to his own might have some ideas and some specific policy stances that are better than obama s own _meta_end_dot_

 i guess we will find out whether sullivan and sunstein are right about obama s supposed burkean temperate measured intellectually open and chicagoan tendencies _meta_end_dot_

 if his iraq policy shows intellectually agility and an ability to adapt to and recognize the conditions currently on the ground i will be genuinely impressed and will doff my hat to senator obama _meta_end_dot_

 but if not then i will nominate the likes of robert gates for honorary membership in the university of chicago s intellectual family and as an heir to burke _meta_end_dot_

 oh and not to put too fine a point on this issue but when one reads posts like this one one cannot help but believe that the commentary and coverage of america s involvement in iraq is being seriously gamed _meta_end_dot_

 perhaps the burkean temperate measured intellectually open and chicagoan senator obama will be kind enough to make a tough but needed speech to the public and address his strongest supporters by saying that whatever their positions on the war it was high time that they paid as much attention to iraq while matters are going well as they did when matters were going less well _meta_end_dot_

 that would be the intellectually open minded thing to do _meta_end_dot_

 that would be what a burkean would do _meta_end_dot_

 that would be what someone whose mind and mindset genuinely ran the philosophical gauntlet at the university of chicago would do _meta_end_dot_

 let s see if barack obama does it _meta_end_dot_
