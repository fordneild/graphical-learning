  but that s no excuse for this _meta_end_dot_

 it is entirely possible for hillary clinton to catch obama and claiming that clinton is mathematically eliminated only serves to reduce the obama campaign s credibility in addition to giving hillary clinton a rhetorical cudgel _meta_end_dot_

 the obama campaign would have done better to say that the momentum they have may make it difficult for clinton to catch up but the only campaign that can say that their opponent is mathematically eliminated is john mccain s _meta_end_dot_

 as jay cost points out much of the reason for obama s recent successes stems from the fact that those recent successes have been in contests where the demographics favored obama s campaign _meta_end_dot_

 while this may eventually be seen as having created irresistible momentum for obama it may also be that once the contests move to states where the demographics favor hillary clinton in say ohio and texas her campaign will be able to recover _meta_end_dot_

 let s therefore not count hillary clinton out just yet _meta_end_dot_

 to say the least she still has the capability to make her presence felt in the race for the democratic presidential nomination _meta_end_dot_
