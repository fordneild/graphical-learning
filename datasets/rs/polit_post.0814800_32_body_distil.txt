  july _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ camp clark washington my very dear sarah the indications are very strong that we shall move in a few days perhaps tomorrow _meta_end_dot_

 lest i should not be able to write again i feel impelled to write a few lines that may fall under your eye when i shall be no more _meta_end_dot_

 i have no misgivings about or lack of confidence in the cause in which i am engaged and my courage does not halt or falter _meta_end_dot_

 i know how strongly american civilization now leans on the triumph of the government and how great a debt we owe to those who went before us through the blood and sufferings of the revolution _meta_end_dot_

 and i am willing perfectly willing to lay down all my joys in this life to help maintain this government and to pay that debt _meta_end_dot_

 sarah my love for you is deathless it seems to bind me with mighty cables that nothing but omnipotence could break and yet my love of country comes over me like a strong wind and bears me unresistibly on with all these chains to the battle field _meta_end_dot_

 the memories of the blissful moments i have spent with you come creeping over me and i feel most gratified to god and to you that i have enjoyed them for so long _meta_end_dot_

 and hard it is for me to give them up and burn to ashes the hopes of future years when god willing we might still have lived and loved together and seen our sons grown up to honorable manhood around us _meta_end_dot_

 i have i know but few and small claims upon divine providence but something whispers to me perhaps it is the wafted prayer of my little edgar that i shall return to my loved ones unharmed _meta_end_dot_

 if i do not my dear sarah never forget how much i love you and when my last breath escapes me on the battle field it will whisper your name _meta_end_dot_

 forgive my many faults and the many pains i have caused you _meta_end_dot_

 how thoughtless and foolish i have often times been _meta_end_exclamation_

 how gladly would i wash out with my tears every little spot upon your happiness _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 but o sarah _meta_end_exclamation_

 if the dead can come back to this earth and flit unseen around those they loved i shall always be near you in the gladdest days and in the darkest nights _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 always always and if there be a soft breeze upon your cheek it shall be my breath as the cool air fans your throbbing temple it shall be my spirit passing by _meta_end_dot_

 sarah do not mourn me dead think i am gone and wait for thee for we shall meet again _meta_end_dot_
