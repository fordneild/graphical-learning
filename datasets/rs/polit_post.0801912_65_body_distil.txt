  two writers from the weekly standard made the case that the gang of _meta_number_ref_ proved a success for president bush and the gop _meta_end_dot_

 for one thing there was a better than even chance that the frist led nuclear option would crash and burn _meta_end_dot_

 for another except for two judges unfortunately thrown under the bus bush s supreme court and circuit court nominees were confirmed _meta_end_dot_

 more below the fold _meta_end_dot_

 i take issue when the writers said that liberals by contrast treated the development as outright victory it was an entertaining two or three days reading post after post at dkos with diarist and commenter alike pissing and moaning about those seven moderate democrats who caved and betrayed their party sound familiar _meta_end_dot_

 why were they upset _meta_end_question_

 because the seven moderate democrats in the gang aren t beholden to the liberal blogosphere moveon org code pink the aclu and any of the other hard left pressure groups _meta_end_dot_

 the hard left lost its leverage on judges _meta_end_dot_

 the fact of the matter is this _meta_end_dot_

 since the gang of _meta_number_ref_ began judicial nominations were taken off the front pages _meta_end_dot_

 why _meta_end_question_

 because mainstream media loves conflict and controversy and there have been hardly any partisan fireworks _meta_end_dot_

 bush has nominated judges the gang of _meta_number_ref_ has given their stamp of approval and the judges have been confirmed _meta_end_dot_

 where s the excitement in that _meta_end_question_

 angered conservatives should get past their anger and see the actual results and they also realize that the nuclear option has not been taken off the table _meta_end_dot_
