  read _meta_end_dot_

 someone had to take the times editorial staff to the rhetorical woodshed good on roger kimball for assuming the responsibility _meta_end_dot_

 incidentally i am still wondering by what extra sensory perception everyone in the bien pensant community has decided that the now infamous passage in the president s knesset speech referred to barack obama _meta_end_dot_

 i suppose it would initially seem strange that the reality based community was making up reality here _meta_end_dot_

 but then this is par for the course for them now isn t it _meta_end_question_

 thanks to instapundit for the link
