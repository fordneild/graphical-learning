  i do believe that the the washington post is a little annoyed at the junior senator from illinois it goes on from there as ed morrissey himself notes the wapo isn t buying this as being anything except a typical politician facing a situation where he has to choose between keeping his word and seeking an advantage i would recommend this article from the center for responsive politics for those wishing to protest that statement _meta_end_dot_

 which when you think of it is one of the more damning things that you can say about the man _meta_end_dot_

 oh well _meta_end_dot_

 no doubt obama will attempt to redeem himself with his base by aggressively opposing the passage of the fisa bill today _meta_end_dot_
