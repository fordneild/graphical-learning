  i almost let this go by the board but i couldn t help myself it s a disease you know and i am seeking a support group _meta_end_dot_

 well pieces of this are true enough the money and government parts but really love and to sling biblical references around well ok she was at a church and suggest that she d been raised to understand the power and purpose of prayer while quickly contradicting her message by rattling off how much more money her government would spend just got me to giggling which is it babycakes _meta_end_question_

 prayer love or greenbacks _meta_end_question_

 inquiring minds really do want to know _meta_end_dot_

 i was reminded of an old sam kinnison act where he suggested the answer to hunger in africa was not to send them food but to send them u hauls so they could i don t know move to where the food was _meta_end_question_

 anyway it continued more below the fold _meta_end_dot_

 now i don t want to come off as insensitive here but really what will _meta_dollor_ref_ billion do exactly _meta_end_question_

 should we consider as limbaugh and others have suggested sending them a couple million barrels of ddt instead _meta_end_question_

 nah can t do that_meta_beep_ref_ _meta_end_exclamation_

 my god people it causes cancer in rats donthca know _meta_end_dot_

 in all seriousness i have a great deal of respect for the work of i will africa and malaria truly is a fixable problem but hillary and big chunks of beaureaucratic cash is not the answer it has failed every time it s been tried _meta_end_dot_

 just remember all she has accomplished for children s health issues in her extensive and illustrious career absolutely nothing _meta_end_dot_

 sadly while the i will africa folks are beaming over this remark from hillary the children are still dying _meta_end_dot_

 and hillary continues to ooze contradiction and faux concern for a problem she really doesn t understand nor give a flip about unless she thinks it might score her some points _meta_end_dot_

 and the children are still dying _meta_end_dot_
