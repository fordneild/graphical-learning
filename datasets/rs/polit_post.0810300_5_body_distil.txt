  left wing historian and hillary supporter sean wilentz has been going on about this for some time but his latest in the new republic does make a significant point read on _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_beep_ref_ now the rules are the rules and i m a firm believer that there s no changing them in the middle of the game the democrats are stuck with the system they chose _meta_end_dot_

 but much as i concluded at the end of the gop race the best possible primary system like the best spring training baseball games is one that replicates as closely as possible the conditions of the fall election no caucuses no proportional delegates _meta_end_dot_

 it s no accident that the caucuses disproportionately favored obama and romney two candidates with tons of money and organization and a hard core of committed followers over the kinds of candidates who have broader appeal of the type that generally prospers in november this is a general point i ve long since given up trying to figure whether obama or hillary is the stronger general election candidate other than that a hillary victory under present circumstances would probably be the best outcome for republicans for the demoralizing effect it would have on several key voting blocs _meta_end_dot_

 and that s before we get to the insanity of the superdelegate system which exists mainly in the democratic system because the democrats don t trust their own voters not to get carried away with left wing nonsense _meta_end_dot_

 and have you tried to get an accurate delegate count lately for the democratic race _meta_end_question_

 it s impossible due to the bizarre opacity of their rules _meta_end_dot_

 there are fair arguments to be made about open vs _meta_end_dot_

 closed primaries and the schedule but it s long past time to bury the caucuses kill off proportional voting and otherwise eliminate any obstacle to having the state by state winners take an ascertainable transparent number of delegates at every stage of the game _meta_end_dot_
