  most redstate readers know about the infamous _meta_number_ref_ supreme court decision kelo v _meta_end_dot_

 city of new london where the court broadened the government s authority to take your home farm business or place of worship _meta_end_dot_

 previously the u s _meta_end_dot_

 constitution specifically limited government taking of private property through a relatively narrow exception for public use public use has historically referred to roads schools firehouses etc _meta_end_dot_

 the negative effects of the far reaching kelo decision places millions of private property owners nationwide at risk _meta_end_dot_

 some states are trying to correct this injustice and have enacted restrictions on the use of eminent domain which in this case is when the government seizes private property with varied effectiveness _meta_end_dot_

 however congress has not taken action to restore private property rights and the abusive use of eminent domain has continued _meta_end_dot_

 that is why i introduced h r _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ the private property rights protection and government accountability act of _meta_number_ref_ along with the house energy and commerce committee ranking member joe barton _meta_end_dot_

 this bill will restrict certain federal economic development funds for _meta_number_ref_ years to any state or locality in which eminent domain is used to take private property for a private purpose _meta_end_dot_

 it will also allow private property owners the legal recourse they deserve to fight baseless private property takings by state and local governments _meta_end_dot_

 no family business operator or place of worship is safe if the government decides that their property does not measure up and that public purpose would be better served if it were torn down and replaced by something bigger glitzier and more taxable _meta_end_dot_

 i hope you will support us as we try to stop the local and state governments from taking your property _meta_end_dot_
