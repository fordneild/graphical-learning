  i don t have nearly the time and space here to do justice to today s opinions on enemy combatants starting with the decision in boumediene v _meta_end_dot_

 bush extending habeas corpus to foreign nationals detained at guantanamo which i summarized below see also leon s post _meta_end_dot_

 i d highly recommend the scathing dissents of chief justice roberts who explains why the court should not have decided that the congressionally enacted procedures provided to detainees were inadequate without either _meta_number_ref_ seeing how those procedures worked in practice or _meta_number_ref_ explaining in any detail how the procedures required by the court would be different and justice scalia who explains why the court got the basic question of the historical scope of habeas wrong and illustrates the lethal consequences of today s decision _meta_end_dot_

 but especially for the benefit of our liberal friends who may be popping champagne corks at another victory for enemy combatants i d like to highlight two points from today s opinions that illustrate some unintended consequences and why in the end they may not accomplish the results claimed for them _meta_end_dot_

 specifically today s decisions will hasten the process of handing off detainees to foreign governments while protracting rather than accelerating the legal process for determining the status of detainees _meta_end_dot_

 read on _meta_end_dot_

 the first comes from the court s less publicized unanimous decision today in munaf v _meta_end_dot_

 geren which held that while habeas extends to u s _meta_end_dot_

 citizens detained by the multinational force iraq the writ cannot be used to prevent the u s _meta_end_dot_

 from transferring u s _meta_end_dot_

 citizen detainees to the iraqi government if it has warrants for their arrest for essentially being enemy combatants presumably the same rule would apply to non citizens _meta_end_dot_

 this despite the fact that the iraqi justice system is obviously not precisely equivalent to our own in terms of procedural protections _meta_end_dot_

 the court also rejected the idea that a u s _meta_end_dot_

 court could prevent transfer of the prisoners based on their claim that they might be tortured by the iraqis although the court did note that there was not a record of a likelihood of torture and three justices would have left the door open for courts to review whether substantive due process bars the government from consigning its own people to torture what does this mean _meta_end_question_

 well it means that detainees at guantanamo could be transferred out of the reach of the new habeas process if the governments of afghanistan iraq or other allies some of whom have been known to swiftly behead such people upon their transfer request that we do so _meta_end_dot_

 in other words if the new procedures prove onerous in practice or run the risk of revealing classified information to our enemies the unintended consequence of the decision to strike down procedures enacted by the u s _meta_end_dot_

 congress may be instead to substitute procedures provided by the afghan or iraqi governments _meta_end_dot_

 can you say rendition boys and girls _meta_end_question_

 i knew you could even five justices of the u s _meta_end_dot_

 supreme court cannot repeal the law of unintended consequences _meta_end_dot_

 the second point on the question of swift justice is explained by the chief justice in boumediene of course the question as to whether additional delay is a bad thing depends on whose intentions are at stake _meta_end_dot_

 for a detainee who is actually improperly held in custoday delay is a bad thing because it means more time in gitmo _meta_end_dot_

 but for those who are genuinely enemy combatants more delay is wonderful more ability to tie up u s _meta_end_dot_

 personnel and resources in courtroom battles more publicity for their cause more grinding down of u s _meta_end_dot_

 morale as expensive court proceedings drag on and provide political fodder for critics of the mission and the military _meta_end_dot_

 like the exclusionary rule in criminal procedure which excludes illegally seized evidence of guilt but gives no remedy to the innocent the court has managed to create a perverse system that burdens anyone who might actually be deserving of a remedy while rewarding those who seek to game the system to the disadvantage of the nation _meta_end_dot_

 gee thanks _meta_end_dot_
