  if change you can believe in is meant to be more than just a slogan barack obama will not hesitate to stand up to people like eleanor holmes norton who proposes to utterly and callously shut down school choice in washington dc there is ample evidence that school choice is the best policy to implement _meta_end_dot_

 and since barack obama assures us that he wants to help us turn a page in our politics it would be great to see him lead by example and take members of his own party to task for hanging on to an outdated unworkable intellectually and morally cruel education policy while advocating the utter and complete ditching of a policy that can significantly enhance the state of education in the united states by leaps and bounds and which is craved by lower income families as a way of helping get their kids out of poverty _meta_end_dot_

 of course if obama doesn t follow through on his promises of change and decides to back the educational antediluvians in his party then i guess we will know what to make of his slogan won t we _meta_end_question_
