  both democratic presidential candidates have been attacked from the left regarding their proposals for reforming healthcare in this country _meta_end_dot_

 the fire comes from the substantial person of michael moore who by virtue of having made a tendentious movie on the subject is now considered by many to be an important expert _meta_end_dot_

 not many people actually saw moore s movie it only grossed _meta_dollor_ref_ million but here s a hint for you if you honestly believe that cuba has the best healthcare in the world you ll probably agree with moore _meta_end_dot_

 believing the un s surveys of healthcare around the world doesn t count because they take the cuban regime s statistics at face value moore wants you to know that both clinton and obama s health care proposals would be good for the hated health insurance industry _meta_end_dot_

 heaven forfend he intends to withhold his undoubtedly valuable endorsement of a democratic contender until one or both of them change their policy prescriptions to suit him better _meta_end_dot_

 so what might a healthcare proposal that hard core lefties could love actually look like _meta_end_question_

 thanks to rep _meta_end_dot_

 john conyers of michigan we don t need to guess _meta_end_dot_

 read on _meta_end_dot_

 here s a link to the text of h r _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ which conyers has introduced in each of the three most recent congresses _meta_end_dot_

 the long list of co sponsors have included ways and means chairman charlie rangel a clinton supporter from her pre senate days the basic idea behind this legislation is to extend the current medicare system to cover every individual in the united states _meta_end_dot_

 i m going to forgo a detailed examination of the text of h r _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ because it obviously won t be taken up seriously until there s a democrat sitting in the oval office and it ll undergo a lot of changes at that point _meta_end_dot_

 instead i ll discuss how this proposal and the clinton obama proposals intersect with reality _meta_end_dot_

 people like michael moore hate the fact that there are people out there who make a profit _meta_end_dot_

 moore hasn t convincingly explained why he chooses to make profits from his movies and to invest those profits in other profit making businesses his canard is that healthcare costs so much in the united states because everyone from the filthy insurance companies to the murderous pharmaceutical providers to the inhumane owners of large hospital chains is out to make a buck _meta_end_dot_

 you long to ask if no one makes a profit then what about all the people whose jobs are created out of those profits _meta_end_question_

 as near as i can figure it s ok if the government makes a profit and spends it on a large health administration bureaucracy but not ok it the private sector does it _meta_end_dot_

 i guess we ll just have to keep fighting this battle as long as every boy and girl who goes to government schools and a politically correct university learns economics from a fundamentally marxist perspective _meta_end_dot_

 enacting a medicare part e and covering every american will on the surface at least do away with the large and heavily regulated health insurance industry _meta_end_dot_

 but this is an industry that showed a strong and capable self preservation instinct during the hillarycare episode in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 this year the health insurance companies are gearing up for the fight early _meta_end_dot_

 as moore points out they re among the largest donors to the campaigns of both clinton and obama _meta_end_dot_

 they don t give so much to republicans apparently because they don t expect one of us to win and so it makes a lot of sense that both clinton and obama would respond by proposing to force more americans to buy the insurance industry s products _meta_end_dot_

 universally in clinton s case for every child in obama s case but as far as i can tell whether we get forced purchases of health insurance or a medicare part e there would be no difference in the overall level of spending _meta_end_dot_

 why _meta_end_question_

 because from what i can see the health insurance industry doesn t really do insurance in the first place anymore _meta_end_dot_

 rather than underwriting risk and spreading it across large pools their primary activity is now all about managing health expenses _meta_end_dot_

 and a huge part of that activity is navigating around the dense thicket of federal state and local regulations not the least of which relate to medicare s byzantine cost control procedures _meta_end_dot_

 the private health insurance industry creates economic value primarily by dealing with the inefficiencies created by the government _meta_end_dot_

 how many times have you heard a doctor complain that her job has become an endless shuffle of paperwork _meta_end_question_

 the future is much more of that in either a mandated coverage world or a single payer world _meta_end_dot_

 there s no practical difference between the two approaches _meta_end_dot_

 ultimately what i think michael moore and his disciples really want is to make healthcare much less of a pain in the tail to buy _meta_end_dot_

 i suspect that goals like cost cutting and equal outcomes which are the overriding objectives of the national health services in britain and canada are secondary to moore and other americans _meta_end_dot_

 ordinary people would be thrilled if you could just somehow know that healthcare would always be available and always reasonably affordable _meta_end_dot_

 and if your view is that the whole country is just one great big underwriting pool you re not really talking about insurance coverage at all in the sense of underwriting and managing risk in insured pools which have different characteristics from other insured pools _meta_end_dot_

 you re just talking about having someone pick up all of the bills _meta_end_dot_

 as free market advocates what should we be proposing as an answer to conyers moore clinton and obama _meta_end_question_

 well we need to start by observing that our current bloated and needlessly expensive system is not a free market system by any stretch of the imagination _meta_end_dot_

 it s a socialist bureaucracy worthy of the soviet union or any other regime that ever bore the name _meta_end_dot_

 why _meta_end_question_

 because our current healthcare system eliminates the most elementary feature of free markets the matching of supply with demand through signals carried by prices _meta_end_dot_

 no one directly pays for their own healthcare anymore _meta_end_dot_

 you either fill out a form for your employer provided insurance and hand over a twenty dollar bill or you go to the emergency room for minor ailments or you fight with a combination of medicare and your co payment insurance _meta_end_dot_

 you have no clear idea what is being paid or by whom in return for the service that you consume _meta_end_dot_

 so you have neither the ability nor even the opportunity to exert the cost controlling magic of free market competition _meta_end_dot_

 if you could directly pay for non emergency healthcare when and where it s provided you would make informed and careful economic decisions about what and how much to consume just as you do with everything else you buy _meta_end_dot_

 and the healthcare industry would rapidly transform itself to meet the free market incentives that would instantaneously appear _meta_end_dot_

 i promise you people this would work like magic _meta_end_dot_

 this isn t rocket science _meta_end_dot_

 just like welfare reform it s a case of all the politicians being simply unwilling to take a very simple step that would immediately make everything better _meta_end_dot_

 but what about the argument that by not providing either universal coverage or universal healthcare our nation suffers because the people who don t provide for themselves will create a social burden anyway _meta_end_question_

 that s easy _meta_end_dot_

 if you really want to you could provide a national plan to insure against catastrophic health issues _meta_end_dot_

 what used to be called major medical insurance and you could do it either in the government if you wanted to or force everyone to buy it from private companies _meta_end_dot_

 neither approach would be as efficient and cost effective as a full free market solution but i m trying to compromise here have either single payer or mandated coverage to insure against expenses that are larger than some number per person per year _meta_end_dot_

 let s say _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ just for fun _meta_end_dot_

 and let everyone pay out of pocket or buy private insurance for all other health expenses in their sole discretion _meta_end_dot_

 it s critical to also end the tax privilege enjoyed by employer provided insurance _meta_end_dot_

 either eliminate that from the tax code or else make health insurance purchases by individuals tax free as well _meta_end_dot_

 i don t care which _meta_end_dot_

 but don t mandate or provide first dollar coverage _meta_end_dot_

 that is the single most destructive feature of our current healthcare system because by definition it destroys pricing signals and cost control discipline at the low end of the market _meta_end_dot_

 and who do we have to thank for it _meta_end_question_

 labor unions of course _meta_end_dot_

 there s even a role for the incumbent health care industry in my plan _meta_end_dot_

 the insurance companies can go back to actually doing the underwriting and risk spreading they re supposed to be doing in the first place _meta_end_dot_
