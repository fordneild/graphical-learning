  the code of conduct and ethics used by medical doctors today is based on the hippocratic oath written by the ancient greek physician hippocrates who is known as the father of medicine _meta_end_dot_

 members of congress take an oath when they are elected too _meta_end_dot_

 unfortunately the one we take leaves out one of the major tenets of the hippocrates s first do no harm but despite not being sworn to it such as a doctor might the instruction of do no harm is one we would all do well to remember when dealing with our country s current economic situation _meta_end_dot_

 the senate is working on a bill to address the instability in the housing market and several members of the house have ideas as well _meta_end_dot_

 however some of these proposals being floated around the hallowed halls of the capitol flagrantly violate the exhortations of hippocrates _meta_end_dot_

 and the democratic majority has several ideas that i believe could actually do serious harm to our economic future _meta_end_dot_

 republicans believe the best way forward is to reward those who have acted responsibly and take action to further promote the american dream of reliable home ownership _meta_end_dot_

 the republican leadership met with the federal reserve chairman ben bernanke prior to his testimony before congress last week _meta_end_dot_

 during our meeting and his testimony he repeatedly stressed that raising taxes would only exacerbate the problems our economy is already facing _meta_end_dot_

 democrats apparently believe that the _meta_number_ref_ percent of americans tightening their belts to pay their mortgages should be on the hook for their neighbor s house note even though he may have lied about his income to secure the note and even if he may have lived well beyond his means _meta_end_dot_

 my constituents back in southwest missouri hit the nail on the head when they told me the majority s housing proposals just weren t fair _meta_end_dot_

 hard working families are already confronting record high food gas and health care costs _meta_end_dot_

 these costs have risen dramatically during the last _meta_number_ref_ months of this democratic do nothing congress and the last thing families should have to pay for it the fiscal irresponsibility of others but that s exactly what the democrats bailouts would do _meta_end_dot_

 the very thought that this majority the same one that passed a nearly _meta_dollor_ref_ billion tax hike the largest in american history would know the first thing about fixing our economy or the housing market is difficult to take seriously _meta_end_dot_

 every bill they have brought to the floor illustrates their over arching all consuming philosophical belief that they know how to spend your money better than you do _meta_end_dot_

 passing any of the flawed legislation before congress with litigation regulation and more taxation at its core would only serve to kick the current problem down the road and in all probability make it harder for future generations to get home loans _meta_end_dot_

 thankfully there s an alternative a balanced and equitable approach that republicans in the house will advance in the weeks to come _meta_end_dot_

 we too believe that congress has a role _meta_end_dot_

 there just have to be some guidelines to ensure that we only reward those who have acted responsibly _meta_end_dot_

 republicans stand ready to work with democrats on proposals that abide by hippocrates oath _meta_end_dot_

 but such proposals must focus one reforming the housing market to make it more transparent and have fairness to the overwhelming majority of homeowners that are paying their mortgages _meta_end_dot_

 we must avoid proposal that raise taxes create more opportunities for trial lawyers than for homeowners provide bailouts to speculators or others who engaged in reckless behavior or giveaway free rides on your dime _meta_end_dot_

 the next step is to extend to these americans a measure of targeted assistance not in the form of a taxpayer funded bailout but with targeted tax relief _meta_end_dot_

 for example in _meta_number_ref_ congress created a tax credit for first time homebuyers in washington d c _meta_end_dot_

 temporarily extending this provision to the rest of the country will provide an incentive for new buyers to enter the market and help stabilize prices _meta_end_dot_

 along those same lines we will fight to keep the pro growth tax relief republicans have fought for and passed over the last several congresses from expiring _meta_end_dot_

 the housing market needs reform and transparency to ensure the current spike in foreclosures doesn t become a feeding frenzy for trial lawyers eager to profit from the misfortune of others _meta_end_dot_

 in that same vein your tax dollars should not be available to save or subsidize real estate speculators and scam artists _meta_end_dot_

 no one should get a free ride on your dime but some reforms should be implemented to help the current housing situation _meta_end_dot_

 that way this congress will finally be doing right by its constituents and my colleagues will finally be observing hippocrates s most important rule _meta_end_dot_
