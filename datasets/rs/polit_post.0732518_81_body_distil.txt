  it may have met with silence from the left and joy from the right but the announcement of a major advancement in the field of stem cell research is something worth being thankful for this year _meta_end_dot_

 there was a debate prior to the nominations of roberts and alito concerning the pro life accomplishments of president bush or lack thereof _meta_end_dot_

 many pro lifers including myself feel that we ve missed opportunities over the past few years to accomplish great leaps forward _meta_end_dot_

 we sense the tide turning in the populace as poll after poll details a shift in the american view of abortion now reaching a point where _meta_number_ref_ out of every _meta_number_ref_ americans hold the view that abortion should only be allowed in cases of rape incest or to save the life of the mother _meta_end_dot_

 we understand he has had other priorities but we wish president bush would have fulfilled his promise in _meta_number_ref_ and invested more effort in using the bully pulpit to apply this shift against our extreme abortion laws _meta_end_dot_

 but as it stands we have to acknowledge one truth about president bush taken as a whole his presidency has marked more achievements for the culture of life than any that came before it _meta_end_dot_

 consider his justice department has selected exceptional and well qualified nominees including two for the highest court in the land his administration has on the vast majority of decisions stayed loyal to the cause of life and on the issue of where the popular path pushed against small government and against life he ignored the polls and took a strong stand _meta_end_dot_

 the medical research industry loves to get taxpayer funding for edgy research that may or may not result in moneymaking treatments at the end of the day and they even lured bill frist to their side _meta_end_dot_

 let us repeat embryonic stem cell research is not banned in america _meta_end_dot_

 it is legal and always has been _meta_end_dot_

 the issue at hand was taxpayer funding of said research and just as the gop does not believe in taxpayer funding for the destruction of unborn people we should not embrace taxpayer funding for the destruction of embryonic people _meta_end_dot_

 now the news is even more promising more than the victories against federal funding even more than the long list of positive news on adult stem cell usage _meta_end_dot_

 without the need to destroy embryonic life medical advancements that can save lives will be achieved without ending them _meta_end_dot_

 let s be thankful for this for news that is happier than we could ever have hoped because president bush took an unpopular stand and stuck by it as the mass media made it become more unpopular the truth about the science of stem cells has won the day _meta_end_dot_

 the culture of death is left to find another issue another stalking horse to replace it _meta_end_dot_

 but on this issue there is no longer any question they lost _meta_end_dot_
