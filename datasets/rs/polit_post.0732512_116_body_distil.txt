  justin hart sent me an email last night with quotes from an assortment of people definitely not tied to the romney camp _meta_end_dot_

 i have to say it does seem clear now in my mind that this was pushing in this poll _meta_end_dot_

 but was it actually a push poll _meta_end_question_

 so now could the culprit be not a candidate but a third party interest group _meta_end_question_

 we haven t talked much about that angle _meta_end_dot_

 isn t that just as plausible as another candidate _meta_end_question_

 a twenty minute poll like this is not something easily affordable by a candidate running for president _meta_end_dot_

 btw justin was also kind enough to talk to ms _meta_end_dot_

 kramer _meta_end_dot_

 she s a seventy year old lady in iowa which fits in the key no axe to grind demographic _meta_end_dot_

 apparently having gotten the calls the romney campaign asked if she wanted to talk to a reporter _meta_end_dot_

 so again it does also seem clear that the media not the campaign left out that detail _meta_end_dot_
