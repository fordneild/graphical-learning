  the more you dig in to this the more troubling it becomes _meta_end_dot_

 in the _meta_number_ref_ election for the illinois state senate obama was running in a four way primary _meta_end_dot_

 to make up ground and pay attention here to make up ground he sought the new party endorsement as well _meta_end_dot_

 in that way obama calculated that he could get the democratic left and the hard left to support him _meta_end_dot_

 but obama was running against alice palmer she was already hardcore left _meta_end_dot_

 so and again pay attention obama went to the left of a hard core leftist to win _meta_end_dot_

 that s what he did by seeking the new party endorsement _meta_end_dot_

 now here is where it gets interesting _meta_end_dot_

 at the beginning of _meta_number_ref_ obama was able to get all of his opponents thrown off the ballot _meta_end_dot_

 mr _meta_end_dot_

 hope and change used the brass knuckles and ran uncontested as the democratic nominee _meta_end_dot_

 we ve already established that the new party had by _meta_number_ref_ become the party of the hardcore leftist radicals an amalgamation of communists socialist and other reds in other words not something acceptable to mainstream america _meta_end_dot_

 why then if he then did not need the new party s support did he keep up the relationship _meta_end_question_
