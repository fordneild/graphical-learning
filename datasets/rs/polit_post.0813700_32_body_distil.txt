  ag jobs bill into the senate emergency supplemental appropriations bill during committee markup today _meta_end_dot_

 this bill relates to giving amnesty to illegal aliens who work as migrant workers _meta_end_dot_

 early intelligence reports that it probably has provisions similar to the last ag jobs bill that was considered including amnesty provisions _meta_end_dot_

 it was supposedly a feinstein craig amendment and was accepted with a vote of _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 if harry reid offers this version of the supplemental as a substitute to the house version he will block out all other senators from any opportunity to strip this ag jobs provision which will ultimately keep potential amnesty provisions in the war funding bill _meta_end_dot_

 your senator s number is _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 update a source tells me that the gop leadership is scrambling to stop this and that this was not done with the gop leadership s blessing _meta_end_dot_

 the house gop leadership is preparing to fight too _meta_end_dot_
