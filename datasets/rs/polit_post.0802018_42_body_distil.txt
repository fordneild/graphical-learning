  having squeaked to a third place finish in south carolina with _meta_percent_ref_ of the vote fred thompson has failed to do even the bare minimum he needed on highly favorable turf to remain a viable presidential candidate and will soon either drop out of the race or remain in mainly as a spokesman rather than a serious contender _meta_end_dot_

 the big five is now down to four and shrinking as mike huckabee s second place finish has wounded him in what had been hoped to be his southern stronghold and rudy giuliani s own do or die moment in florida and the test of his unusual hang back and let them bruise each other strategy rapidly approaches with the specter of john mccain the guy whose appeal overlaps most with rudy s as his primary obstacle although rudy may draw a few supply siders from the beaching of the good ship fred and is calibrating his attacks accordingly _meta_end_dot_

 fred will be remembered as the mycroft holmes of presidential candidates _meta_end_dot_

 you will recall that sherlock holmes said that his older brother mycroft would have been the greatest detective who ever lived if that could be accomplished without leaving his armchair _meta_end_dot_

 that s fred in a nutshell indeed the high watermark of the fred phenomenon was his hilarious video response to michael moore delivered _meta_end_dot_

 from an armchair _meta_end_dot_

 fred s diehard supporters will complain that the mainstream media done him wrong but as i have explained before there were any number of full scale conservatives one might have tried to draft into the race we had serious and experienced if not quite as across the board conservative contenders running already in sam brownback and duncan hunter the reason people settled on fred was precisely because his background as an actor and trial lawyer suggested a guy who like reagan could work around and over the heads of the media _meta_end_dot_

 his failure to do so effectively was what doomed his campaign _meta_end_dot_

 read on _meta_end_dot_

 fred tried to _meta_number_ref_ enter late and _meta_number_ref_ run one of those new kind of campaigns that never work on the presidential level even if one of the two was possible the combination added to the erratic quality of his public appearances on the trail even many fred supporters came away disappointed at some of his speeches and debate appearances and the general lack of a well run campaign organization fred turned out not to be able to learn to run an organization having never done so before was fatal _meta_end_dot_

 fred refused to play by old rules he felt were demeaning but he didn t come up with an effective substitute _meta_end_dot_

 it was said of henry clay that he would rather be right than president at times it seemed that fred would rather be cool than president _meta_end_dot_

 and in the end he didn t even maximize his ability to embrace the new _meta_end_dot_

 one of my fellow redstate contributors suggested some time back that fred should combine his talk radio experience and the power of youtube to do a daily video message of the day that could reach web connected voters nationally on a daily basis at almost no cost _meta_end_dot_

 such a video could be short _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ minutes and run from a prepared script yet be far more substantive than a _meta_number_ref_ second tv spot and would still be a great idea for any presidential contender doubly so for one with fred s talents unlike the largely ignored campaign blogs it would be visibly the work of the candidate himself _meta_end_dot_

 yet after the initial and sometimes rambling off the cuff efforts at fred answers to voter questions fred basically disappeared from web video productions _meta_end_dot_

 so much for the new kind of campaign _meta_end_dot_

 anyway we may not yet be done with fred as he would make a fine vice presidential nominee although mccain is almost certainly the guy he is least suited to run with as such a ticket would be too old too senatorial and too inside the beltway _meta_end_dot_

 but like mycroft holmes he will be best remembered as a walk on part in somebody else s adventures _meta_end_dot_
