  after facing attacks from the right and left senate republican leader mitch mcconnell is fighting back against accusations that he s gone soft on spending _meta_end_dot_

 the veteran appropriator outlined a proposal today that would fund the troops and complete _meta_number_ref_ of _meta_number_ref_ budget bills _meta_end_dot_

 his plan would cap domestic spending at president bush s level of _meta_dollor_ref_ billion with an across the board cut but also salvage _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ earmarks in the process _meta_end_dot_

 for an appropriator like mcconnell the idea of a _meta_percent_ref_ across the board cut is revolutionary _meta_end_dot_

 but what bothered conservatives as i documented earlier was the fact he didn t single out earmarks _meta_end_dot_

 continued on the jump _meta_end_dot_

 the news was disappointing because just _meta_number_ref_ hours earlier a democrat house appropriations chairman david obey actually proposed eliminating all earmarks from the omnibus spending bill _meta_end_dot_

 i scratched my head after hearing the mcconnell proposal wondering why the senate s top republican wouldn t embrace obey s idea _meta_end_dot_

 here s an exchange from a press conference earlier today eliminating earmarks goes hand in hand with fiscal restraint but for some members of congress the pork is too good to pass up _meta_end_dot_

 while it s safe to assume that mcconnell likes his pork as much as the next guy i do want to clarify one point from my earlier post _meta_end_dot_

 a statement released by mcconnell s office tonight said he would support an earmark free bill if that s what the house sent him which remains a big if at this point _meta_end_dot_

 here s my beef with mcconnell he ll take what s given to him from obey but he won t stand up and call for the outright elimination of earmarks on his own _meta_end_dot_

 countering with an across the board cut is a nice touch that would save taxpayers their hard earned money but i was hoping for more _meta_end_dot_
