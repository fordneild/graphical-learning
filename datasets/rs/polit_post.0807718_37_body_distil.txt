  the lawyers are going to florida _meta_end_exclamation_

 well atlanta at least _meta_end_dot_

 they re hearing the arguments today more here h t political punch _meta_end_dot_

 not being a lawyer i don t know if there s actually a case to be made here i just know that this just gets funnier and funnier every day _meta_end_dot_

 hey _meta_end_exclamation_

 if there s a case to be made and it gets appealed to the supremes and they can t hear it before say september does that mean that the plaintiff can get an injunction forbidding the dnc from holding its convention until the matter s resolved _meta_end_question_

 well probably not _meta_end_dot_

 too bad _meta_end_dot_
