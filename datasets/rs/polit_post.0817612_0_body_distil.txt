  barack obama and hillary clinton are going to have their first joint appearance since clinton dropped out of the race _meta_end_dot_

 the site is unity new hampshire _meta_end_dot_

 it s symbolic of what the democrats want to achieve of course but something is interfering with the symbolism _meta_end_dot_

 and that something is the clintons the vast majority of those supporters will back barack obama _meta_end_dot_

 but they may not do much more than vote _meta_end_dot_

 combine that with the supporters who may either stay home or vote for john mccain and you see why this may well be a closer race than many people believe it will be _meta_end_dot_
