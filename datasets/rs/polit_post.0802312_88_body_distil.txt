  to paraphrase president reagan there they go again _meta_end_dot_

 associated press writer douglas daniel has written an article promoting more lies misrepresentations and left wing extremist propaganda trying to revive the loony left s thoroughly debunked fiction that we were misled into war in iraq by false statements and lies on yahoo the douglas article is titled study false statements preceded war but cbs news the ever accurate former employer of dan rather originally carried the article under the headline study _meta_number_ref_ years of lies led to iraq war _meta_end_dot_

 that was too much even for the president bush hating propagandists at cbs who toned it down to study false pretenses led u s _meta_end_dot_

 to war i am so very tired of this propaganda _meta_end_dot_

 mr _meta_end_dot_

 douglas does not acquit himself well as a reporter here _meta_end_dot_

 perhaps that is why he is identified as a writer _meta_end_dot_

 he does little other than regurgitating the misleading talking points put forth in the press release posted on the web site of the cleverly named center for public integrity _meta_end_dot_

 according to wikipedia despite its claims to be a nonpartisan news organization the center has been accused of bias toward left wing political causes because it has accepted money from organizations and individuals that favor liberal policies and or actively oppose right wing political causes read on _meta_end_dot_

 at the new york times john cushman jr doesn t do much better but the headline is more restrained _meta_end_dot_

 even though douglas and cushman put forth the press release talking points claiming that president bush and other administration officials made hundreds of false statements leading us to war in iraq they both fails to do any fact checking _meta_end_dot_

 oh they note that journalists and news organizations have issued mea culpas saying their pre war coverage was too deferential and uncritical but they fail to mention that no less than three exhaustive studies have concluded that there is no justification for the false allegation that the administration lied about the wmds _meta_end_dot_

 everyone was convinced that saddam had wmds _meta_end_dot_

 it remains a fact saddam used wmds against iran and his own people _meta_end_dot_

 the intelligence and common wisdom that iraq still possessed such weapons at the time we liberated iraq proved to be wrong but that doesn t equate to a lie _meta_end_dot_

 so lets go over the facts again _meta_end_dot_

 the bipartisan senate select committee report on the u s _meta_end_dot_

 intelligence community s prewar intelligence assessments on iraq found no evidence of political pressure to change the intelligence community s judgments related to iraq s weapons programs _meta_end_dot_

 at pages _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ the report states besides that report two other independent investigations came to the same conclusion _meta_end_dot_

 the robb silberman commission on the intelligence capabilities of the united states regarding weapons of mass destruction likewise found no evidence of political pressure at pages _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ the robb silberman report states british butler report review of intelligence on weapons of mass destruction similarly found no evidence of deliberate distortion at page _meta_number_ref_ the british butler report states president clinton secretary of state madeline albright is it so much to ask that news service writers and reporters do a little fact checking _meta_end_question_
