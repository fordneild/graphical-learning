  as you know the junior senator from illinois is making a speech today alternatively you can go with the washington times simultaneously more cynical and more accurate take on it obama eyes white suburbs of philadelphia i predict that no matter how he actually does on this speech the media will more or less take it as answering his critics carefully fold up the whole controversy and thriftily put it in storage _meta_end_dot_

 it s still a month to pennsylvania and this story has pretty much hit saturation point anyway _meta_end_dot_

 hillary s turn next then maybe a quick shot at mccain just to remind him that he s not entirely off the hook until after the conventions _meta_end_dot_

 obama supporters should not necessarily breathe easier though _meta_end_dot_

 their guy is now off the pedestal _meta_end_dot_

 he s on the rotation to get smacked around now _meta_end_dot_

 yes i too look forward to seeing how he reacts to being treated as a mere human _meta_end_dot_
