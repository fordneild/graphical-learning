  i m a peaceable man so i m going to not say the first four things that came into my head after reading this fortunately i can safely note the fifth which is that fred phelps and his ilk really do fit in with the rest of the antiwar movement and instead just join the exasperated group of people who would like to know what our current democratic candidates for president feel about all of this _meta_end_dot_

 i see no reason not to duplicate chicago boyz question which boils it down nicely yes i know ever the optimist i am _meta_end_dot_
