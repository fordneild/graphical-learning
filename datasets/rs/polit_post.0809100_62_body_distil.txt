  a very small vague chance _meta_end_dot_

 anyway karl rove has discovered one of the most potent richest most tingly joys of the universe giving good advice to people who are predisposed to not believe a single word that you say _meta_end_dot_

 if you ve never had it happen to you it s an amazing experience _meta_end_dot_

 you combine the virtue of speaking sooth even when it s against your best interest with the relaxing almost smug pleasure of knowing that you are almost certainly doing so in perfect safety _meta_end_dot_

 i spent a large part of _meta_number_ref_ in this state and let me tell you it s great stuff _meta_end_dot_

 they should bottle it _meta_end_dot_

 via aoshq and read on _meta_end_dot_

 the advice itself is pretty prosaic mostly technical issues and things that any competent campaign should know already _meta_end_dot_

 of course neither party is really competent at dealing with national conventions that aren t rubber stamped but the information s there in the books to be read and rove s done his homework _meta_end_dot_

 each of the five rules is illustrated with helpful examples from the last century and is used to show how the theoretical principle works in the real world _meta_end_dot_

 this is general level stuff mind you it s not really meant for the professionals _meta_end_dot_

 it s meant for the amateurs who are starting to pay attention to the possibility that the denver convention might devolve into one glorious chaotic mess _meta_end_dot_

 it really is a pity for them that said amateurs are too blinded by their rather simplistic political theology to take rove at all seriously _meta_end_dot_

 everything that karl suggested is much more obvious to the cynical vastly more experienced clinton campaign than it is to the one that obama s thrown together if it goes to the convention hillary s people will tie up barack s in procedural knots without the latter ever quite knowing what happened to them _meta_end_dot_

 and if she can win the primary vote she will go ahead and win the primary vote because she and the democratic party knows that its left wing has nowhere else it can go and that the african american vote has nowhere else it wants to go _meta_end_dot_

 nonsense about how either group will stay home is just that nonsense _meta_end_dot_

 they caved every time that their bluff s been called in the past who really believes that they ll do the same now _meta_end_question_

 which is why this is such a funny article _meta_end_dot_

 the very people that rove is offering good general convention advice to are the very people most unconstitutionally incapable of following it _meta_end_dot_

 and he must know it which is why he probably laughed as hard writing the article as i did reading it _meta_end_dot_
