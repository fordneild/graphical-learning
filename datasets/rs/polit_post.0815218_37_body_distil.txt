  _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 they aren t particularly interested in backing down on this issue and _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 it may have sounded like a typical democratic rally but it looked and smelled like one of ours _meta_end_dot_

 which is to say lots of american flags almost no reek of patchouli _meta_end_dot_

 more will be after the fold _meta_end_dot_

 i got to woodley park about _meta_number_ref_ am or so and popped into the local driving a tractor through the front window _meta_end_dot_

 we feel like having an egg mcmuffin this next picture really highlights an interesting nature of the event _meta_end_dot_

 the guy on the far right was what you me and zombietime are used to when it comes to non gop protesters a little freaky very sad and not entirely present on planet earth _meta_end_dot_

 and there were a couple of those people present this guy and the obligatory che t shirt wearer but they were well outnumbered by people like these these _meta_end_dot_

 and these _meta_end_dot_

 obama supporters _meta_end_dot_

 i would also like to note by the way that the eighty degree sunny hot day quickly established that clinton supporters and the obama supporters who showed up to this are apparently not only aware of but even actually approve of the use of both soap and deodorant _meta_end_dot_

 i told you this wasn t a zombietime special _meta_end_dot_

 but let me show you a couple of case studies by the way i wasn t hassled at all during this demonstration despite the fact that i made it clear that i was blogging for a republican weblog _meta_end_dot_

 meet keith and april they readily gave permission for me to use their first names _meta_end_dot_

 they re locals who take the position that the delegations from both states need to be seated in full out of elementary fairness _meta_end_dot_

 they actually managed to snag tickets for this thing which took some luck and are currently working on signs with news organization names on them to show the crowd in order to find out from them what said crowd thinks were showing the most fair coverage _meta_end_dot_

 then they planned to tell the committee and never mind the committee s request for sitting there quietly and not talking _meta_end_dot_

 as april matter of factly noted she s got this thing called freedom of speech that she plans to use _meta_end_dot_

 if this situation isn t resolved keith will probably still vote for the democratic nominee april will have to think about it if it s obama _meta_end_dot_

 neither is particularly alarmed at the notion of mccain becoming president instead _meta_end_dot_

 this was pretty much a model for the rest of the day _meta_end_dot_

 i m certain that there were people quite prepared to vote for obama if he s the candidate it s just that i didn t meet any and they probably would have been hard to hear over the following chanted slogans no florida no white house _meta_end_exclamation_

 no michigan no white house nancy pelosi shame on you also starring howard dean harry reid yeah _meta_end_dot_

 weird huh _meta_end_question_

 not as weird as seeing some of these signs _meta_end_dot_

 note that american flags were not exactly thin on the ground conclusions _meta_end_question_

 the obama campaign had best hope that this crowd i am not certain how big it was and any guess would be pretty much random is not representative of clinton s supporters _meta_end_dot_

 they are not happy they are not interested in the dnc s counter arguments they are definitely clinton partisans and they are currently ticked at the democratic party _meta_end_dot_

 how much of that is selection bias is an interesting question but not as much as how much of that is putting up a game face for the cameras _meta_end_dot_

 to be honest i was expecting more childish street theater and less real anger _meta_end_dot_

 there was also a much wider age range than you might expect from the current media narrative _meta_end_dot_

 and i wasn t expecting that the bds would have been damped down to a bare minimum aside from an unfortunate tendency to dwell on the nonsense story of how the _meta_number_ref_ florida election was stolen they didn t seem to care much about the gop at all for this one _meta_end_dot_

 this could be kind of confusing actually i kept expecting somebody to bust out screaming about dick cheney _meta_end_dot_

 but then imagine this guy s head space from what i saw he spent the day not getting hassled either _meta_end_dot_

 in an event dominated by clinton supporters _meta_end_dot_

 truly we have gone beyond the fields we know _meta_end_dot_

 moe lane ps this has nothing to do with the protest it was merely left over in my camera s memory _meta_end_dot_

 but that is one damn cute kid if i do say so myself _meta_end_dot_
