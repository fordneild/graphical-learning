  i m going to speak my mind and leave no stone un thrown _meta_end_dot_

 rare of me ain t it_meta_beep_ref_ i realize the presidential candidates for the gop have their master strategies and don t want to burn bridges etc _meta_end_dot_

 but i also see the republicans in congress and perhaps excepting those in the new reagan _meta_number_ref_ caucus they really are freakin clueless about how angry a lot of us still are with them _meta_end_dot_

 the candidate cowards running for president need to be more aggressive in actually asserting the need to clean up our own house _meta_end_dot_

 come on people _meta_end_exclamation_

 if you aren t out on the campaign trail actually speaking the names don young ted stevens john doolittle and jerry lewis saying how unacceptable it is that these men remain in the ranks of republican leaders you really are pathetic _meta_end_dot_

 the republican voter is fed up _meta_end_dot_

 we re fed up recognizing the virtual impossibility of winning in _meta_number_ref_ because the republican minority in congress won t clean up their act and the republican presidential candidates vying for the top job in the party are going no further than talking about speaking up for the republican wing of the republican party to his credit at least mitt s gone that far _meta_end_dot_

 zero leaders on the issue that actually got the gop thrown out of office last year _meta_end_dot_

 let me be the leader on this issue _meta_end_dot_

 it is totally and completely unacceptable for don young ted stevens john doolittle and jerry lewis to maintain the level of influence they do on the republican congressional leadership _meta_end_dot_

 and it s about time our presidential candidates say so because mitch mcconnell trent lott and john boehner either don t mind or are too scared _meta_end_dot_
