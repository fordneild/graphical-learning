  on monday thousands honored reverend jeremiah wright the man and the message _meta_end_dot_

 barack obama was not there _meta_end_dot_

 the celebration was held by the reverend s congregation and was attended and joined by visiting speakers and guests _meta_end_dot_

 when the wright reverend arrived he was greeted with a powerful standing ovation _meta_end_dot_

 during the ceremony the reverend did not speak but was lavished with speeches and praise _meta_end_dot_

 as before at trinity wright was compared to jesus by several of the speakers _meta_end_dot_

 among the congregants and guests a consensus view was clear wright is right everyone else doesn t get it _meta_end_dot_

 the remark by rev _meta_end_dot_

 moss above is a telling comment _meta_end_dot_

 democracy he says will not become a reality the country cannot be united _meta_end_dot_

 these things will not come to pass if the reverend wright is vilified _meta_end_dot_

 evoking imagery of jackboots and batons he declared if they silence our voice in the morning they will be coming to your church in the evening america is a republic of course _meta_end_dot_

 no accident of fate our founding fathers arrived at our system of government through deliberation and inspiration _meta_end_dot_

 this is no meaningless distinction _meta_end_dot_

 to trivialize the difference is to trivialize the work of the founders themselves something i trust the reverends moss and wright have no quarrel with _meta_end_dot_

 and what is a direct democracy if not mob rule _meta_end_question_

 is it not the tyranny of sentiment _meta_end_question_

 the reign of the many over the pain of the few _meta_end_question_

 maybe it is just this that reverend moss seeks _meta_end_dot_

 who can doubt that a pulpit of lies would wield its influence tyrannically _meta_end_question_

 we see the echo of such tyranny in the machinations of the race baiters and tension peddlers already _meta_end_dot_

 those pc police who would exert their popularly derived authority over not merely your speech but your thoughts _meta_end_dot_

 of course it is the common understanding that when we speak of democracy in popular culture we refer to the concept of representative democracy _meta_end_dot_

 in other words a republic _meta_end_dot_

 we may presume that reverend moss means democracy generally or even that he refers to a republic _meta_end_dot_

 reverend moss then is suggesting that the will of the people is being thwarted that they are disenfranchised that they are not free _meta_end_dot_

 what is clear is that whichever form of the word he is using he is certain we do not possess it _meta_end_dot_

 reverend wright taught and preached that the united states is actively engaged in genocide _meta_end_dot_

 wright was rightly vilified for his odious pulpiteering _meta_end_dot_

 yet thousands have gathered to say that it is he who has been transgressed against he who has been wronged _meta_end_dot_

 the most instructive fact at hand is that they do not dispute the merits of the case against him _meta_end_dot_

 these gathered celebrants were there because of wright s message just as that message inspired barack obama _meta_end_dot_

 the trinity united church of christ was filled to the rafters with praise for this message _meta_end_dot_

 that wright was wronged is taken for granted but not that he was taken out of context _meta_end_dot_

 some interviewed outside the event suggested that excerpting gave the wrong picture of the wright reverend that s true _meta_end_dot_

 however like barack obama in his race speech they did not suggest that such excerpting mischaracterized his intent only that it failed to provide examples of his kindness or his love of god or his admonitions of service _meta_end_dot_

 reverend moss fears that failing to honor the message of reverend wright will prevent the united states from becoming united and free _meta_end_dot_

 like his predecessor the man preaching from the pulpit of the influential trinity united church of christ doesn t believe we are free and he doesn t believe we are united _meta_end_dot_

 i find myself swayed by his words _meta_end_dot_

 when thousands can come together to cheer the message that america the beautiful is false that america the genocidal terrorist state is true _meta_end_dot_

 how can we say we are united _meta_end_question_

 barack obama says he wants to unite this nation heal her wounds and close the great and terrible racial divide _meta_end_dot_

 the spiritual guide on the path to his vision of unity is a man who s vision of america is bleak bloody and broken _meta_end_dot_

 these two leaders do not speak to deaf ears or prattle in vain on street corners _meta_end_dot_

 no they stand before crowds who cheer their words and chant their names _meta_end_dot_

 on monday thousands honored reverend jeremiah wright the man and the message _meta_end_dot_

 barack obama was not there but twenty years of guidance suggest those cheers echoed where he was _meta_end_dot_

 i can only pray they never echo among the walls and passageways of the white house _meta_end_dot_
