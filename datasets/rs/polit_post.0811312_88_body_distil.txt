  i have a slightly different take on the iranians preference for obama than does my esteemed colleague dan mclaughlin _meta_end_dot_

 time magazine s scott macleod reports that sergei barseghian a columnist for the iranian reformist newspaper etemad meli national confidence notes that in farsi the words oo ba ma would translate as he s with us iranians are following the american presidential race _meta_end_dot_

 in part because they wish to be rid of president bush who branded iran part of an axis of evil and because they are taken in by obama s false hope _meta_end_dot_

 according to macleod iranians favor obama s hope rhetoric and see a president obama repairing the u s iranian relationship read on there is more _meta_end_dot_

 senator mccain on the other hand with his more realistic idealism is less likely to make nice to the iranians merely for the sake of making nice _meta_end_dot_

 the islamic society of north america isna the nation s largest association of muslim organizations tried to persuade mccain to drop the adjective islamic when describing terrorists and extremists realistic idealism indeed _meta_end_dot_

 the failed policy of merely criminalizing terrorism brought us to _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 al qaeda attacked us on _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ because the organization thought we didn t have the stomach to fight _meta_end_dot_

 following many attacks on americans in lebanon in the _meta_number_ref_s and _meta_number_ref_s culminating in the bombing of the marine barracks in beirut in _meta_number_ref_ america withdrew _meta_end_dot_

 our response to attacks during bill clinton s presidency withdrawal angry words occasionally accompanied by a few cruise missiles resulted in attack after attack _meta_end_dot_

 mogadishu in _meta_number_ref_ the _meta_number_ref_ attack on world trade center the attack on the u s _meta_end_dot_

 military office in riyadh in _meta_number_ref_ the attacks american embassies in kenya and tanzania in _meta_number_ref_ and the near sinking of the uss cole in yemen in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 i prefer the current approach to fighting the war the islamic extremists continue to wage against us and mccain s realistic idealism to the false hope of obama s aggressive personal diplomacy
