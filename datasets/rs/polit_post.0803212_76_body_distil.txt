 john mccain s florida primary victory has made the likelihood of a mccain nomination a virtual certainty and has focused the choice for conservatives vexed by this state of affairs _meta_end_dot_

 just as the primary has become a binary choice between two conservative credential challenged men so have conservatives and republicans suddenly been presented with a choice between two equally bad options _meta_end_dot_

 it boils down to this do we conservatives want to win ugly or lose pretty _meta_end_question_

 read on in _meta_number_ref_ many conservatives commentators rank and file and activists alike argued that republicans in congress deserved a good spanking for their sins of overspending earmarking and in general betraying the base while in power _meta_end_dot_

 by losing control of congress the theory went republicans would see the error of their ways reconnect with conservative principles and win control of congress back in short order _meta_end_dot_

 while the new republican minority in the house has been feisty and the senate has become minority leader mitch mcconnell s personal plaything republicans stand little chance of wresting control from the democrats in this election cycle _meta_end_dot_

 at last count _meta_number_ref_ republicans in the house are retiring this year and the gop has to defend _meta_number_ref_ senate seats to the democrats _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 it is safe to say that with those numbers stacked against them the republican party will not be recapturing capitol hill this year no matter who it nominates for president _meta_end_dot_

 now for the second consecutive election and with the bitter taste of _meta_number_ref_ still in their mouths conservatives look at the likely republican nominee and purse their lips _meta_end_dot_

 but the alternative mitt romney is not exactly a teaspoon full of sugar _meta_end_dot_

 both mccain and romney are less than perfect conservatives _meta_end_dot_

 romney on social issues is a recent convert and mccain on taxes campaign finance immigration and judges has a somewhat checkered past _meta_end_dot_

 so if both men are flawed and one of them is going to be the nominee conservatives are going to have to take their medicine eventually _meta_end_dot_

 if that is the case we may as well do so in a winning effort _meta_end_dot_

 let s look at this from the democrats perspective for a moment _meta_end_dot_

 sen _meta_end_dot_

 hillary clinton is still the odds on favorite to win her party s nomination although the senator from h o p e barack obama is giving her more of a fight than she bargained for _meta_end_dot_

 how would clinton fair against the potential republicans _meta_end_question_

 against romney she would win in a walk _meta_end_dot_

 romney is a nice enough guy and a brass knuckles campaigner as evidenced by his campaign s relentless conveyor belt of opposition research that dumps out in sympathetic reporters inboxes _meta_end_dot_

 but his relative lack of experience on the national level plus his aw shucks demeanor will make him easy prey for the clinton war machine _meta_end_dot_

 clinton will go up one side of romney s record and down the other finding ways to criticize him for all the positions he has taken and feel no shame in doing so _meta_end_dot_

 romney has earned the reputation of being the one republican most willing to say anything to get the nomination _meta_end_dot_

 yet compared to the clintons he looks like george washington at the cherry tree _meta_end_dot_

 clinton _meta_number_ref_ will tell lies and spin distortions that would make baron m nchhausen seem like honest abe by comparison _meta_end_dot_

 but how would the machine take on mccain _meta_end_question_

 they can t paint him as a conservative and a right wing nut doing so might actually help mccain with republicans _meta_end_dot_

 and they can t paint him as more of the same since mccain has bucked the republican party in so many high profile ways _meta_end_dot_

 so they are left with temperament a wink and a nod to his years in confinement and risky if the democratic party wants to ever win military votes again _meta_end_dot_

 or they go the business as usual and corruption route the keating five _meta_end_dot_

 imagine the clintons attacking an opponent on corruption _meta_end_dot_

 the pundits might never stop laughing _meta_end_dot_

 they could go after mccain s age _meta_end_dot_

 he is _meta_number_ref_ and would be the oldest person elected to a first term _meta_end_dot_

 but seniors are an important part of the democratic base _meta_end_dot_

 this strategy too is risky _meta_end_dot_

 they could turn into immigration hawks in hopes of playing up mccain s negatives on the issue especially among republicans and conservatives _meta_end_dot_

 here again however they would risk alienating a growing constituency hispanics that their primary strategy is deliberately courting at the expense of blacks _meta_end_dot_

 clinton may end up damning mccain with faint praise to paint mccain even more moderate and depress turnout among the republican base _meta_end_dot_

 democrats have no good options for attacking mccain _meta_end_dot_

 his image as a straight talking principle over party politician is the very antithesis of clinton _meta_end_dot_

 worse she improves his standing amongst his skeptics with each attack she makes on his record _meta_end_dot_

 mccain beats hillary _meta_end_dot_

 he also beats obama who he will make look like a teenager _meta_end_dot_

 but obama must first prove that he can beat clinton before he merits a more serious analysis _meta_end_dot_

 conservatives have always valued ideological purity over electoral potential and rightly so _meta_end_dot_

 in an ordinary election principle counts and just because the democrats don t have any doesn t mean that conservatives should allow their would be leaders to shun theirs _meta_end_dot_

 this is no ordinary election though _meta_end_dot_

 this election will have profound consequences for the country in the war on terror and for the future of the supreme court _meta_end_dot_

 a democratic victory means in all likelihood a precipitous withdrawal from iraq with afghanistan not too far behind _meta_end_dot_

 this would be a victory for al qaeda there is no other way to say it and must be prevented at all costs _meta_end_dot_

 the supreme court has three aging liberals at least two of which are waiting for a democratic president to nominate his her successor _meta_end_dot_

 losing two supreme court justices to the democrats would deprive conservatives the chance to finally obtain a true originalist majority on the court _meta_end_dot_

 the current makeup of the court is balanced right on the razor s edge with its four conservatives four liberals and one swing vote _meta_end_dot_

 it has taken close to _meta_number_ref_ years for conservatives to get to this point and the opportunity must not be lost _meta_end_dot_

 these two issues the war on terror and the makeup of the supreme court are important enough for conservatives to allow flexibility on principles to preserve past gains and prevent future losses _meta_end_dot_

 sen _meta_end_dot_

 mccain whatever one thinks of his record would be infinitely better on the war and judges than sen _meta_end_dot_

 clinton _meta_end_dot_

 infinitely _meta_end_dot_

 to make the perfect the enemy of the good for which conservatives have a particular affinity and shun mccain in favor of hillary clinton is electoral and political suicide _meta_end_dot_

 political movements gain power by showing that they can elect candidates _meta_end_dot_

 conservatives have demonstrated this time and time again _meta_end_dot_

 but sometimes a movement has to show that it is willing to play ball as well _meta_end_dot_

 this is that time for conservatives _meta_end_dot_

 the voters have shown and likely will continue to show that it is sen _meta_end_dot_

 mccain s time to shine _meta_end_dot_

 he was not our first choice _meta_end_dot_

 but barring a political miracle from mitt romney himself not our first choice mccain will be the nominee _meta_end_dot_

 we should support him and fight to win ugly _meta_end_dot_
