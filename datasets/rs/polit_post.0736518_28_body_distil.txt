 trent lott s resignation gave republicans an opportunity to make a clean break from the big spending and earmark loving lawmaker _meta_end_dot_

 unfortunately i m not sure things will change all that much with the appointment of rep _meta_end_dot_

 roger wicker to fill lott s seat _meta_end_dot_

 wicker deserves to be congratulated on the appointment the latest step in a congressional career that some might say began when he was a house page in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 he s clearly a talented lawmaker serving as chairman of the house freshman class in _meta_number_ref_ and a strong social conservative illustrated by his high marks from family research council _meta_end_dot_

 but he s also a long time appropriator who has a penchant for bringing home pork to his mississippi district _meta_end_dot_

 i compared his ratings from taxpayer groups to lott s and i m not impressed _meta_end_dot_

 american conservative union lifetime wicker _meta_number_ref_ _meta_percent_ref_ lott _meta_number_ref_ _meta_percent_ref_ club for growth _meta_number_ref_ wicker _meta_percent_ref_ lott _meta_percent_ref_ national taxpayers union _meta_number_ref_ wicker _meta_percent_ref_ c lott _meta_percent_ref_ b continued on the jump _meta_end_dot_

 believe it or not gov _meta_end_dot_

 haley barbour actually picked the better of the two republicans who represent mississippi in the house from a fiscally conservative standpoint _meta_end_dot_

 rep _meta_end_dot_

 chip pickering s scores from taxpayer groups are worse than wicker s _meta_end_dot_

 i d venture to guess that wicker probably won t be as obnoxious as lott who famously quipped that he was getting damn tired of hearing from so called porkbusters and said recently earmarks are justified and legitimate hopefully wicker will recognize their corrupting influence and use his new perch to join with sens _meta_end_dot_

 tom coburn and jim demint to do something about them _meta_end_dot_

 here s how captain ed put it we can only hope _meta_end_dot_
