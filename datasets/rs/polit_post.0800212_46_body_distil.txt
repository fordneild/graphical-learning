  i don t actually watch television i m too cheap for cable and can live with the notion of watching the few truly must see shows after the fact so i have only an intellectual understanding of the incongruity of having mr _meta_end_dot_

 seacrest acquire the answer to a significant political question via protein wisdom _meta_end_dot_

 it s just as well god knows that the primaries this year were complicated enough at least on the gop side but i d like to commend mayor bloomberg for at least making a simple declarative statement that can t be weaseled out of without lasting political damage _meta_end_dot_

 and _meta_end_dot_

 not bad mr _meta_end_dot_

 seacrest _meta_end_dot_

 unconventional interviewing technique to be sure but it got a straight answer out of the man without you having to lie to him first which is the idea _meta_end_dot_

 i wouldn t let it get to your head or anything but i think that you can justify putting a token of this one up on your ego wall _meta_end_dot_
