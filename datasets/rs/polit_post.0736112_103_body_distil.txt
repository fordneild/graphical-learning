  one of the criticisms national review received from people not from this neck of the woods though in its endorsement of mitt romney was the lack of emphasis in the endorsement on foreign affairs _meta_end_dot_

 today is a day when it d be handy to have a president with competent foreign affairs experience _meta_end_dot_

 as we learned from the new york times yesterday hillary is not that candidate _meta_end_dot_

 read on _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 i say this as a fred guy _meta_end_dot_

 i m a firm believer that only fred or mccain could actually win in november against one of the democrats _meta_end_dot_

 neither of them will split the party and between the two of them i think they are the only candidates who have been consistent over the long term _meta_end_dot_

 but ignoring fred for a minute no offense fredheads seriously does america need john mccain _meta_end_question_

 is it his time not because it is his due but because a confluence of events around the world make joe biden the most experienced choice on the democratic side and mccain the most experienced choice on the republican side _meta_end_question_

 the union leader makes perhaps the most persuasive case already whispers have begun that if fred thompson can t pull off iowa conservatives will need to rally around a candidate and that candidate is most likely john mccain _meta_end_dot_

 is john mccain the man to lead america _meta_end_question_

 the union leader said yes _meta_end_dot_

 and they just might be right _meta_end_dot_
