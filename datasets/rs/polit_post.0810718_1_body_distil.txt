  for more than a week the controversy surrounding barack obama s comments to a weathy group of san franciscans possibly the wealthi est according to geraghty has continued _meta_end_dot_

 and while hey it s great to see controversy on the other guy s side of the field the real tragedy is how the frame of those comments has been shifted by the coverage _meta_end_dot_

 bitter is terribly easy shorthand to describe the comments _meta_end_dot_

 so easy it s what the media the clintons even some republicans have focused on _meta_end_dot_

 but let s be clear bitterness is not the issue _meta_end_dot_

 obama s characterization of religion as a crutch is many times more offensive _meta_end_dot_

 even to me a lousy catholic with roots in western pa _meta_end_dot_

 this isn t about rust belt voters being cranky frustrated feeling left out or any such garbage _meta_end_dot_

 this is about the great hope candidate describing the most important things in people s lives as something disordered something to flee towards because they drew the short nafta straw _meta_end_dot_

 insert inappropriate profanity laden rant oh and if we could only get better jobs and subsidized healthcare they wouldn t need to rely on such nonsense _meta_end_dot_

 this guy isn t mlk he s not ghandi he s not even rfk _meta_end_dot_

 he s mcgovern with a better stump speech _meta_end_dot_

 and while hillary isn t qualified to make that case let s hope senator mccain is the man to do it _meta_end_dot_
