 jeff flake of arizona needs our help to get him appointed to the house appropriations committee _meta_end_dot_

 flake is by far one of the best conservatives we have in the house who constantly wages war against earmarks and big government republicanism _meta_end_dot_

 as most of us would agree we lost our majority in _meta_number_ref_ because we abandoned our conservative principles of limited government less spending and fiscal discipline _meta_end_dot_

 now the republican party has an opportunity to show the american people their commitment to our most cherished values by appointing a conservative who will curb spending and put an end to earmarks _meta_end_dot_

 read on _meta_end_dot_

 we must appoint a conservative who will put a stop to the corrupt earmark system and out of control spending _meta_end_dot_

 jeff flake is the best man for this position because he is a proven leader against earmarks _meta_end_dot_

 he will not be a puppet but rather a principled leader who will stand up to the corruption and wasteful spending _meta_end_dot_
