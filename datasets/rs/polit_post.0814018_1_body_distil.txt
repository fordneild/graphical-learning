  recently the tennessee state board of education ruled diplomas issued to home schooled students from religious based schools were invalid as proof of the successful completion of high school should it be presented for employment purposes for a job for which state law requires a diploma _meta_end_dot_

 you read that right _meta_end_dot_

 according to the state board of education all diplomas are equal but some diplomas are more equal than others _meta_end_dot_

 tennessee conservoliance blogger red hat rob the board of education s rationale is since they had no input over the curricula which resulted in the diploma they won t recognize the diploma since they don t know what it represents _meta_end_dot_

 for instance the diploma could mean only that the student had _meta_number_ref_ years of school yet cannot read well enough to complete an employment application and will need remedial classes for his first year of college _meta_end_dot_

 but there s a problem _meta_end_dot_

 it s nicely pointed out by red hat rob _meta_end_dot_

 education has always been a prime subject for measurement _meta_end_dot_

 i m not particularly opposed to that since i m a big believer in rewarding individual effort if it s successful and working to improve performance if it isn t _meta_end_dot_

 to do that it is vital we know how well a particular person is doing in the skill we re measuring _meta_end_dot_

 the tennessee board of education and red hat rob are both right on one thing _meta_end_dot_

 the presentation of a diploma is no measure of a student s learning or ability _meta_end_dot_

 it only means the student has completed _meta_number_ref_ grades _meta_end_dot_

 for that reason big education has always touted certain metrics as being indicative of the success or failure of educators in providing a quality education _meta_end_dot_

 high on the list of metrics is act scores _meta_end_dot_

 they are useful for group comparisons as opposed to individual successes or failures _meta_end_dot_

 red hat rob refers us to the act itself which reports in act news that in _meta_number_ref_ the national average score on the act was _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 the average score for high scool grads in tennessee was _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 that makes tennessee students just a little less than average as a group _meta_end_dot_

 while that figure is a composite of home educated privately educated and governmentally educated students who took the test it generally may be taken to mean that tennessee s board of education is willing to accept as satisfactory a diploma that represents a slightly less than average education _meta_end_dot_

 what would be really interesting is examining data that broke down the different groups based on performance _meta_end_dot_

 how do government schools compare to home schools for example _meta_end_question_

 fortunately we have just such a comparison available _meta_end_dot_

 red hat rob refers us to a report from the education resources information center eric an official site of the united states department of education which has such numbers from _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 an eric digest titled the scholastic achievement of home schooled students from september of _meta_number_ref_ found the following it further found addressing our question of act scores a long standing metric for determining academic success the digest reports what was the act composite score for tennessee students for _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_question_

 in the year homeschoolers averaged _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ and the national average was _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ tennessee s students scored just _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ a full _meta_number_ref_ points below home schoolers _meta_end_dot_

 this put tennessee ahead of only north and south carolina mississippi louisiana and washington dc _meta_end_dot_

 the composite home school score places them first among the _meta_number_ref_ jurisdictions represented in the study _meta_end_dot_

 unfortunately the digest attempts to downplay the astounding statistics noting in essence it says the digest reports home school students outperform government school students by significant margins _meta_end_dot_

 they do so throughout their academic careers _meta_end_dot_

 they do so measured any way you choose including standardized tests _meta_end_dot_

 they do so consistently as reported in studies covering a variety of samples locations and times _meta_end_dot_

 but eric concludes home schools are not superior to government schools _meta_end_dot_

 it only demonstrates _meta_end_dot_

 home schooling provides a very successful academic environment i only attended government schools but even i can read between those lines and discern the truth _meta_end_dot_

 tennessee s board of education is going with the government line home schooling must be automatically rejected since we don t know what they ve learned and government schools must be accepted since we know what they ve learned unfortunately state educators missed the widely available and easily located studies and reports that prove them wrong _meta_end_dot_

 they didn t do their homework _meta_end_dot_

 or perhaps they missed the lesson on how to do a research paper _meta_end_dot_

 we shouldn t hold it against them though _meta_end_dot_

 they probably went to government schools too _meta_end_dot_
