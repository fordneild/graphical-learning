  earlier in the week i read this piece by bernard finel of the bipartisan but john kerry led american security project _meta_end_dot_

 i have been struggling with how to respond to it _meta_end_dot_

 final first argues that we are hitting metrics of improvement in iraq _meta_end_dot_

 the economist makes a very similar point _meta_end_dot_

 it seems clear that they are correct _meta_end_dot_

 unfortunately finel a man of the left and the huffington post finel goes too far and declares the progress illusory _meta_end_dot_

 the economist on the other hand finds room for tentative optimism or quoting petraeus finds that progress is fragile and reversible _meta_end_dot_

 finel s broader point is legitimate though _meta_end_dot_

 we must not let our domestic politics which will get very nasty over the next _meta_number_ref_ months get in the way of our assessment of what is happening on the ground _meta_end_dot_

 read on _meta_end_dot_

 finel grasps the scope of the challenge that we face but seems to think that it is both illusory and that it will be exploited for electoral gain the economist makes this same point without seemingly pre judging the resolution the economist also notes that progress is also being made on legal and economic fronts _meta_end_dot_

 what finel fails to really account for in his analysis is the optimism on the ground in iraq _meta_end_dot_

 again the economist tries to capture this the question that we need to seriously address is how we can protect the operations in iraq from the next _meta_number_ref_ months of brutal politics in the united states _meta_end_dot_

 john mccain clearly and i think rightfully thinks he has the upper hand on this issue which is why he invited barack obama to join him on a trip to iraq _meta_end_dot_

 the entire logic of obama s candidacy unravels if he were to acknowledge succcess in iraq _meta_end_dot_

 but if the next _meta_number_ref_ months of debate on iraq policy is spent relitigating the decision to go into iraq as finel finally ends up doing rather than figuring out where to go from here in a way that maximizes iraqi stability and american interest we will not be serving our country well at all _meta_end_dot_
