  i don t know whether it was the empress theodora who said this or whether it was eric flint but either way it s good advice constant reader susannah notes that the democrats are in the process of ignoring that advice _meta_end_dot_

 i think that there are two mistakes that republicans need to avoid with regard to this rather unique situation in american politics not taking advantage of the opportunity and not following the above advice _meta_end_dot_

 well if it was going to be easy then it d already be done wouldn t it _meta_end_question_

 read on _meta_end_dot_

 let me start off with the second mistake _meta_end_dot_

 getting more voters should not take precedence over holding to our core principles even if it gets us a net increase in votes _meta_end_dot_

 there are a lot of conservative voters out there who are already gingerly voting mccain even though he s not their first choice or second choice or even fourth _meta_end_dot_

 i say this as a moderate liberal squishy soft rino whatever i am it s not quite the problem that it looks like online very few things are but it is a problem and we need to remember that _meta_end_dot_

 so we can t give away the store to the potential new customers _meta_end_dot_

 the old customers will feel betrayed and they will have reason _meta_end_dot_

 however we can still make the sale _meta_end_dot_

 how _meta_end_question_

 by doing three things _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 find common ground _meta_end_dot_

 from my own experience this is most likely to be on national security issues senator clinton seems to have been the final destination for centrist democrats in general at least on natsec policy _meta_end_dot_

 they may not think that we re winning the war but they don t want to lose it either so we can talk to them about it _meta_end_dot_

 more generally if you re in conversation with a clinton supporter and you end up legitimately agreeing with them about something for heaven s sake say so _meta_end_dot_

 even if your opinion is actually at odds with conventional republican orthodoxy_meta_beep_ref_ if you can explain how you can reconcile your differences it helps if you actually have of course it will only help the conversation _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 be forthright but not abusive about your lack of common ground _meta_end_dot_

 there are certain truths about the republican party _meta_end_dot_

 we welcome people who are adamant about ending abortion _meta_end_dot_

 we welcome people who want to shrink our government down to the size of lithuania s _meta_end_dot_

 we welcome people who want to launch the united nations building into orbit with the grudging concession of giving the denizens five minutes head start _meta_end_dot_

 i m exaggerating some of this for comic effect but the point is that there really are major differences between the two parties and for some people these differences will be too high to surmount _meta_end_dot_

 rather more will need to have the issue at least addressed _meta_end_dot_

 when that happens in a particular place maintain politeness _meta_end_dot_

 if you disagree with someone on a topic carefully note it and explain why make sure that you actually listened to them apparently this is a problem for human beings in general _meta_end_dot_

 if it becomes clear that there is no compromise available simply shrug smile and make some variant of the comment this is what it is about me if they become abusive about it simply disengage _meta_end_dot_

 those people were probably going to fall back into the democratic orbit anyway and at least this way neither of you are wasting your time _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 avoid sadism _meta_end_dot_

 you may not understand why a particular person has a personal attachment to senator hillary clinton s plight but if you can ask without coming across as rude do so _meta_end_dot_

 but if it exists it exists and we are after all trying to avoid the mistakes of antiwar democrats who have still not worked out that they would have won in _meta_number_ref_ if they had just lost their fairly irrational bush hatred or even kept it down to a dull roar _meta_end_dot_

 i m not saying that you have to like the woman she s not on my christmas card list but if there are elements of her story and personality that you can actually respect then it s ok to say so to a clinton supporter_meta_beep_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 bottom line we will not get every disaffected clinton supporter _meta_end_dot_

 many of them don t really want to be gotten and that s their privilege _meta_end_dot_

 but we can get the folks for whom the last few months have been a bit of an eye opener _meta_end_dot_

 we just have to be smart and honest about it that s all _meta_end_dot_

 moe lane for example i personally am an advocate for permitting same sex marriage albeit via legislation and not judicial fiat _meta_end_dot_

 i support doma not as good law but merely as a good idea in order to allow the nation to see how various ssm programs play out _meta_end_dot_

 i did not and will not support the fma _meta_end_dot_

 and i m still a site moderator for a major republican conservative weblog _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_beep_ref_for another example as i said i don t overly like the woman mostly for her policy positions but there are certain personality elements that i m not entirely fond of _meta_end_dot_

 but she actually does the job in the senate that she was elected to do she s been good about visiting the troops and she certainly went down swinging in the primaries _meta_end_dot_

 in all of this she stands in stark contrast to the assumed democratic nominee and there s no harm in saying so _meta_end_dot_
