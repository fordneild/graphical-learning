  just when i had started to warm back up to john mccain whom i strongly supported in _meta_number_ref_ along comes a story that is a vivid reminder of what makes him untrustworthy for all his sacrifice and service to the country his ideology aims at its dissolution _meta_end_dot_

 the story this time is that john mccain employs as a hispanic outreach director a man who is in essence the agent of a foreign power _meta_end_dot_

 he is on record in implacable opposition to assimilation i want the third generation of immigrants the seventh generation i want them all to think mexico first he ran an organization which held a cute contest artistically depict the border fence like berlin wall and win a prize _meta_end_exclamation_

 his career as an oath bound agent of the government mexico consisted of the kind of sanctioned sedition that has grown up all around the pro immigration faction _meta_end_dot_

 john mccain s strongest appeal is his patriotism a love of country that exacted a severe price _meta_end_dot_

 but what kind of patriotism can countenance the affront represented by men like mr _meta_end_dot_

 juan hernandez _meta_end_question_

 what kind of patriotism can embrace men like him who make it their business to agitate among foreign born populations against the sovereignty the laws the authority of our country _meta_end_question_

 to destructive policy his comprehensive dispossess america bill mccain has added insult _meta_end_dot_

 he has crowned folly with subversion _meta_end_dot_

 mark kirkorian rightly notes that before the judicial usurpation of politics under the warren court mccain s adviser would be stripped of his citizenship for having accomplished an expatriating act by his oath to another government _meta_end_dot_

 let that sink in _meta_end_dot_

 for nearly two centuries before the advent of the tyranny of the robed masters of the supreme court american law would have regarded candidate mccain s adviser as unworthy of citizenship on grounds of disloyalty _meta_end_dot_

 so what kind of patriotism countenances this treachery _meta_end_question_

 patriotism of abstraction that s what kind _meta_end_dot_

 when america becomes merely a convenient label with which to bundle one s ideological enthusiasms merely a shell into which one may pour whatever political content one likes why then real existing america may be trampled on with impunity _meta_end_dot_

 actual laws actual property actual communities actual culture all these return void before the might of america the abstraction _meta_end_dot_

 cracked eggs for the omelet _meta_end_dot_

 juan hernandez should be fired forthwith _meta_end_dot_
