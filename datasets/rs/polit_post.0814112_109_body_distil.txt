  and here i bet that you thought this primary race was scraping the bottom of the surreality barrel _meta_end_dot_

 folks we re just getting started _meta_end_dot_

 the primaries are almost over clinton by lots in kentucky by the way obama by _meta_number_ref_ in oregon and contra a lot of hopeful sorts the democrats selection process looks more like it ll run out of gas before it ll run down _meta_end_dot_

 they weren t prepared for somebody to make a fight for it all the way down the line and does it ever show _meta_end_exclamation_

 oh yes she s making a fight for it interrupting for a given value of politically evil of course _meta_end_dot_

 but this andrew malcolm fellow is otherwise refreshingly free of irrational impotent hatred towards everyone to the right of joe lieberman so we ll forgive it just this one time _meta_end_dot_

 anyway after noting the way that clinton called obama rovian malcolm continues read on _meta_end_dot_

 the aforementioned maps may be perused here they do indeed demonstrate that clinton mccain favors the democrats while mccain obama favors the gop _meta_end_dot_

 to summarize both maps very quickly in mccain obama _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ there are eight toss up states between _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_percent_ref_ for mccain if he wins ohio and virginia both currently _meta_percent_ref_ and keeps all the other states above _meta_percent_ref_ then the election s over mccain wins _meta_end_dot_

 in clinton mccain _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ there are six toss up states and if clinton wins missouri _meta_percent_ref_ mccain and minnesota _meta_percent_ref_ she wins and if she loses missouri michigan is tied so she can win by getting that one_meta_beep_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 these are all based on current polls of course there s been a good deal of movement on mccain obama towards the latter in the last week and about the same one sided movement towards the former in clinton mccain _meta_end_dot_

 so nobody assume that these numbers are set in stone _meta_end_dot_

 nonetheless they are there and senator clinton has swiftly and certain of her fellow democrats would no doubt say shamelessly_meta_beep_ref_ seized upon them as part of her campaign _meta_end_dot_

 ironic in its way but also fairly smart of her _meta_end_dot_

 a lot of democrats have invested considerable emotional energy into hating karl rove and they ve taken the time to construct this amazingly detailed and quite ludicrous group hallucination where he was and is the ultimate political puppet ascended secret master of the vrwc _meta_end_dot_

 those people may hate clinton for this rank apostasy but they ll still worry _meta_end_dot_

 because you know it s karl rove _meta_end_dot_

 and remember while i know that karl rove is just this guy with a good memory access to lots of good data and a talent for putting together a working political strategy on the tactical level and you know that and heck many if not most of our democratic lurkers know that we re all political junkies _meta_end_dot_

 our perceptions are not the public s perceptions which have been flavored by a lot of professional politicians active connivance in turning karl rove into mephistopheles machiavelli _meta_end_dot_

 and they re going to wonder what this all means _meta_end_dot_

 when malcom wrote he finished up by noting that rove could have simply been telling the truth as he saw it _meta_end_dot_

 i somehow suspect that quite a few of his compatriots are going to wonderfully reject that as far too easy an answer _meta_end_dot_

 moe lane and come to think of it the way that obama or more accurately his handlers were able to manipulate the system to the point where the democrats seem almost ready to give the nomination to the guy who won wyoming idaho and utah over the woman who won california ohio and massachusetts was almost rovian _meta_end_dot_

 i say almost because karl would have given some thought about how his guy could win the primary without terminally aggravating roughly _meta_percent_ref_ and rising of his party s base _meta_end_dot_

 heck i would have _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_beep_ref_by the way in rove s current mccain obama matchup michigan goes to mccain by _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 heck of a job that you re doing at the dnc howard _meta_end_dot_

 heck of a job _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_beep_ref_if you re someone who would call this shameless could you do us a favor and say so loudly in a democratic forum _meta_end_question_

 anywhere clinton supporters hang out will do _meta_end_dot_

 thanks in advance _meta_end_exclamation_
