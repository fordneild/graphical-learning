  when i looked at the long list of tax hiking democratic governors back in the spring i gave an incomplete grade to maryland s new democratic governor martin o malley not out of any illusions about whether he was anything but a standard issue tax and spend liberal but simply because he hadn t done anything yet _meta_end_dot_

 well no need to wait longer for the verdict _meta_end_dot_

 e j _meta_end_dot_

 dionne predictably hails o malley s billion and a half dollar tax hike passed earlier this week read on _meta_end_dot_

 the fact that even dionne recognizes that this is three dollars in tax hikes for every dollar in spending cuts as well as the massive expansion of medicaid to another _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ recipients should tell you all you need to know about o malley s commitment to protecting the taxpayer _meta_end_dot_

 also the _meta_dollor_ref_ million is a apparently a cut in state spending growth not actual spending reductions _meta_end_dot_

 indeed dionne hails the maryland governor as the man who can bring back the case for big government yup a billion dollar tax hike is exactly mark warner s formula for success virginia voters will soon enough be asked whether they want him to pressthat same philosophy nationally _meta_end_dot_

 and the fine print goes deeper than just a burden on marylanders who work hard for their money _meta_beep_ref_ fortunately for maryland it has a lot of company these days among states with tax hiking democratic governors _meta_end_dot_
