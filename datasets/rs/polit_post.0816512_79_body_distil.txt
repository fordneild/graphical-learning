  barack obama may be the political equivalent of a rock star with his huge crowds and his celebrity endorsements but his economic policies are simply the warmed over liberalism of the sixties and seventies _meta_end_dot_

 stale liberalism doesn t have a history of success in america and doesn t match his image of hope and change _meta_end_dot_

 this same old big government tax and spend liberalism is a far cry from a new politics so obama has been forced into some creative marketing to sell his leftist ideology as post partisan solutions to the country s problems _meta_end_dot_

 if you can cut through the hype and the rhetoric his worldview is clear _meta_end_dot_

 look at the way he talks about money _meta_end_dot_

 tax cuts are giveaways and wasteful spending forget for a moment whether specific tax cuts enhance revenue or stimulate the economy _meta_end_dot_

 instead remember that tax cuts are fundamentally different from government spending because the money isn t the governments to begin with _meta_end_dot_

 this captures the liberal view perfectly the government knows how to spend your money better than you do _meta_end_dot_

 wanting to keep your own money is selfish and wasteful _meta_end_dot_

 obama even made the ludicrous claim that it is only with his nomination that america can began to heal the sick and find jobs for the jobless _meta_end_dot_

 it is only increased government spending that can solve problems and only obama who can lead the way _meta_end_dot_

 obama is counting on the fact that many americans have a poor grasp of history _meta_end_dot_

 he is counting on the fact that high gas prices and a slowing economy might tempt them to return to a philosophy that has failed repeatedly in the past _meta_end_dot_

 have we forgotten the legacy of lyndon johnson and jimmy carter _meta_end_question_

 it was lyndon johnson who waged the war on poverty and initiated urban renewal these crusades resulted in a system of dependency and family dysfunction based on the warped incentives of government welfare in rising crime rates and destroyed neighborhoods in bloated government bureaucracies and higher taxes _meta_end_dot_

 jimmy carter brought this same attitude to washington _meta_end_dot_

 his solution to america s problems was more federal government control and spending _meta_end_dot_

 is american education better off since carter created the department of education _meta_end_question_

 is america more energy independent and secure since the creation of the department of energy _meta_end_question_

 did carter s policies jump start the us economy _meta_end_question_

 obviously the answer to all these questions is no _meta_end_dot_

 the carter administration was a time of long gas lines and rationing stagflation and rising unemployment _meta_end_dot_

 a general malaise fell over the country _meta_end_dot_

 facing this crisis carter famously called on americans to sacrifice in the name of energy conservation _meta_end_dot_

 rejecting the dynamism and innovation of america carter proposed that we simply learn to live with less _meta_end_dot_

 despite all of his charisma obama brings the same attitude _meta_end_dot_

 he too castigates americans for selfishly driving the car they want or for using air conditioning too often _meta_end_dot_

 he too believes that the answer to our energy challenges is more federal spending _meta_end_dot_

 he too believes that domestic sources of energy must be off limits that the desires of the environmental lobby trump our national interest and the pocketbooks of average americans _meta_end_dot_

 he too opposes free trade and favors big unions over small businesses _meta_end_dot_

 obama s record matches his attitude if not always his seemingly centrist campaign rhetoric _meta_end_dot_

 obama and his allies in congress have tried to resuscitate the windfall profits tax strategy that failed during the carter administration _meta_end_dot_

 in his first three years in the senate obama voted for increasing taxes _meta_number_ref_ times including taxes on coal natural gas payroll and income _meta_end_dot_

 obama talks at length about only raising taxes on the rich but he voted in favor of increasing the _meta_number_ref_ percent federal tax rate to _meta_number_ref_ percent this bracket covers income from _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ to _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ for individuals and between _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ and _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ for married couples _meta_end_dot_

 and his plans to end the cap on social security taxes means an increase for anyone making more than _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 in order to get elected obama is sure to campaign with centrist rhetoric _meta_end_dot_

 he will try to play on the weariness of voters tired of washington _meta_end_dot_

 his fresh face and rhetorical skills will be used to convince voters he is different _meta_end_dot_

 in reality obama is a traditional liberal who favors more government and less freedom _meta_end_dot_

 these policies have been tried and failed _meta_end_dot_

 dressing them up with fancier words and bigger crowds won t change the outcome _meta_end_dot_

 let s hope voters remember their history _meta_end_dot_
