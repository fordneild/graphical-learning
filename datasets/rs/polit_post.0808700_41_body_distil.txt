  let s let you two in on a little secret congressmen _meta_end_dot_

 we already knew that you and your colleague bonior were being enthusiastically used by the hussein regime to hamper the american war effort _meta_end_dot_

 it wasn t exactly hidden after all _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ had demonstrated quite graphically that our working definition of acceptable risk with regard to rogue states needed drastic revamping and under any civilized or rational standard the iraqi situation was intolerable _meta_end_dot_

 so there s no reason to be shocked now that the late unlamented genocidist might have been more than happy to smooth your path to baghdad and dishonor _meta_end_dot_

 we just hadn t realized that he was actively paying your way _meta_end_dot_

 mcdermott s response through a spokesperson of course is that he went on this trip for the iraqi children thompson at least has sufficient shame to claim ignorance _meta_end_dot_

 my response to both and to bonior is that it s a hell of a thing when you have to hope that three members of congress were simply too abjectly stupid to realize that they were being enthusiastically useful idiots for a man who casually murdered inconvenient ethnic groups whenever they got in his way _meta_end_dot_

 about the only thing that be said for it is that it beats contemplating the possibility of actual sedition on the part of sitting american legislators which is much the same thing as saying that a punch in the groin beats getting your hand cut off _meta_end_dot_

 just because one s preferable to the other doesn t mean that it s good to have it done to you _meta_end_dot_

 moe lane ps actually i have another response but if either of them were man enough to not seek re election as expiation for this error they wouldn t have put themselves in a position to have made that error in the first place _meta_end_dot_

 so simply not in your names mr _meta_end_dot_

 mcdermott mr _meta_end_dot_

 thompson _meta_end_dot_

 and may you be forgotten _meta_end_dot_
