  redstate will be endorsing no one if i have my way btw _meta_end_dot_

 we all have our candidates but this site should overall take a neutral stance i think and let each individual here make his own case for his preferred candidate _meta_end_dot_

 we re in this together against the democrats regardless of who the nominee is _meta_end_dot_

 but anyway drudge says nr is endorsing mitt _meta_end_dot_

 i thought they had months ago just reading over there _meta_end_dot_

 is anyone surprised _meta_end_question_

 consider this an open thread _meta_end_dot_

 i m off to get sworn into office _meta_end_dot_

 fear me dirty hippies _meta_end_dot_

 update from ben yes it s true _meta_end_dot_

 follow the cover link _meta_end_dot_

 as an aside i am still trying to convince erick that we ought to endorse a candidate _meta_end_dot_

 he just doesn t like my top three _meta_end_dot_

 wuss _meta_end_dot_

 an excerpt from nr more than the other primary candidates romney has president bush s virtues and avoids his flaws _meta_end_dot_

 his moral positions and his instincts on taxes and foreign policy are the same _meta_end_dot_

 but he is less inclined to federal activism less tolerant of overspending better able to defend conservative positions in debate and more likely to demand performance from his subordinates _meta_end_dot_

 a winning combination by our lights _meta_end_dot_

 in this most fluid and unpredictable republican field we vote for mitt romney
