  john mccain is anti black _meta_end_question_

 that s not exactly what politico com s jonathan martin reports but he makes a bit much of the senator s imaginary apathy towards his state s african american population _meta_end_dot_

 you see he hasn t attended their events and they have taken notes _meta_end_dot_

 same says greater phoenix black chamber of commerce president ron busby though martin does point out that i nterviews with black civic and business leaders in arizona found no one who suggested that mccain holds racial animus martin suggests that mccain doesn t care why doesn t he care _meta_end_question_

 martin tells us prisoner _meta_end_dot_

 of _meta_end_dot_

 war _meta_end_dot_

 from _meta_number_ref_ through to _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 and when john mccain was finally released from the hanoi hilton on march _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ barack obama was aged _meta_number_ref_ and living in honolulu with his maternal grandparents _meta_end_dot_

 please read on although it runs counter to his thesis martin includes the following then again gullet maintains that many of these african american pastors are now either dead or have morphed into jeremiah wright if mccain does have a problem with arizona s black voters this november it will be because he is running against barack obama not because he cannot be bothered with them _meta_end_dot_

 and perhaps to many of them this election is not as simple as a choice between an undefined nebulous hope and national and economic strength and security _meta_end_dot_

 either way it is all politics _meta_end_dot_

 obama inspired politics _meta_end_dot_
