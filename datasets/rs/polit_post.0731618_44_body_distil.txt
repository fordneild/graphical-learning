  here s funny spin from the huckabee fans _meta_end_dot_

 their tag line now to discredit the rumored nrlc endorsement of thompson is that thompson did not have a _meta_percent_ref_ pro life record in the senate _meta_end_dot_

 of course if you actually look at the data they cite it s because nrlc scored mccain feingold _meta_end_dot_

 take out the campaign finance reform votes and thompson has a _meta_percent_ref_ record _meta_end_dot_

 i d remind everyone likewise that fred was endorsed by nrlc when he ran for the senate _meta_end_dot_

 more importantly the huckabee folks write the huckabee fans might want to spend more time explaining away mike s tax increases and quotes on executive compensation and carbon offsets than attacking thompson who in fact did have a _meta_percent_ref_ pro life record in the united states senate _meta_end_dot_

 let me add something else here too i would suggest given thompson s personal biography that people not begin suggesting he is less than supportive of life _meta_end_dot_

 as he s said in the past going from the death of one child to the birth of another there is no way fred thompson could be anything other than _meta_percent_ref_ pro life _meta_end_dot_
