  according to the united states constitution article iii section _meta_number_ref_ on two separate occasions now the united states congress has duly enacted painstakingly specific laws to lawfully and constitutionally strip the supreme court of jurisdiction to hear cases involving non citizens currently detained outside of sovereign territory held by the united states _meta_end_dot_

 as dan mclaughlin has noted today the supreme court purports to ignore this clear limitation on its own authority to even hear the case before it which by law has been confined to the cadc and issue an opinion declaring the act which removed their jurisdiction unconstitutional _meta_end_dot_

 savor the irony for a moment if you will _meta_end_dot_

 with his trademark dullard arrogance justice kennedy informs us that enforcing the detainee treatment act of _meta_number_ref_ and the military commissions act of _meta_number_ref_ would permit a striking anomaly in our tripartite system of government leading to a regime in which congress and the president not this court say what the law is how astute of you to notice justice kennedy that congress and the president got the idea that they had the constitutional authority to say what the law is by say passing laws through both chambers of congress and submitting them for the approval or veto of the president _meta_end_dot_

 it s almost as though they read article i section _meta_number_ref_ and then article iii section _meta_number_ref_ and got the idea that they had some say in what the law is thank god anthony kennedy is here to clear up this confusion on the part of the duly elected representatives of the people of the united states _meta_end_dot_

 hope you guys understand allowing this would be anomalous the reasons why the suspension clause do not apply to non citizens detained outside the territorial jurisdiction have been hashed and rehashed already on the front page of redstate i will not go over them again here _meta_end_dot_

 as it happens i haven t been convinced that giving gitmo detainees access to united states courts would be the end of the world _meta_end_dot_

 nevertheless i believe that this case presents such an important question that now is the time for president bush to openly and forthrightly defy this usurping court _meta_end_dot_

 the issue here is not the detainees at gitmo the issue is a court which recognizes no limits on its own authority whose members sit for life tenure never subject to any electoral consequences for their decisions _meta_end_dot_

 when such a body refuses to recognize lawfully and constitutionally enacted limits on its own authority it threatens the very foundations of our representative democracy _meta_end_dot_

 the court must be sent a message to remind them of the truly limited power that they do possess under the constitution and the limited power they should possess in a representative democracy _meta_end_dot_

 andrew jackson once invited the supreme court to attempt to enforce one of their decisions if they could _meta_end_dot_

 it is time for president bush to extend the same invitation to this usurping court _meta_end_dot_
