  a couple of groups have john mccain in their crosshairs in south carolina _meta_end_dot_

 from the washington post this is about as vile a smear as i ve seen and it should be condemned by even the most ardent mccain opponent _meta_end_dot_

 the tactic of indirectly accusing mccain of treason while a prisoner of war is so out of bounds that no further explanation should be necessary _meta_end_dot_

 the attack is not unlike the ones made by the hardline left on rudy giuliani for his conduct as mayor after _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 more below the fold _meta_end_dot_

 then there s this both claims are false and misleading _meta_end_dot_

 mccain s position on federal funding of embryonic stem research is here _meta_end_dot_

 a fetus begins at the eighth week which is why the auto call is dishonest _meta_end_dot_

 embryonic stem cell research involves blastocysts which are post zygote and pre embryonic _meta_end_dot_

 no matter where a person falls on the issue for me i m uncomfortable with federal funding for this kind of research we should at least agree on the basic facts _meta_end_dot_

 second point _meta_end_dot_

 the failed immigration bill was not amnesty no matter how many times rush limbaugh sean hannity and legions of other conservatives say it _meta_end_dot_

 was it a flawed bill _meta_end_question_

 yes _meta_end_dot_

 was the price too low for illegals to obtain legal status _meta_end_question_

 i could go with that _meta_end_dot_

 was it amnesty _meta_end_question_

 sorry but i don t accept that label because english is our common language and we should be using commonly accepted definitions _meta_end_dot_

 i know i m swimming against the tide here but i strongly believe in the integrity of our common language _meta_end_dot_

 if everyone defines words his or her own way then the result is chaos and all kinds of unnecessary misunderstandings _meta_end_dot_

 as noted in the washington post article mccain has a rapid response team to deal with these kinds of attacks and it was formed because of the hard lessons learned eight years ago in the palmetto state _meta_end_dot_

 but in the interests of fairness and balance mccain is no innocent either _meta_end_dot_

 factcheck org has the following on a pro mccain mailer the third point is debatable because mccain co sponsored an amendment to strip out the funding for the woodstock museum but you get the drift _meta_end_dot_

 i m not an opponent of negative ads or statements that differentiate one candidate from another but the standard should be that the candidate making the differentiating had better get it right _meta_end_dot_

 mccain didn t in his mailer and neither did vietnam veterans against mccain and the benign sounding common sense issues _meta_end_dot_

 update more here on jerry kiley and ted sampley the execrable leaders of vietnam veterans against mccain _meta_end_dot_
