  ask your average well informed person what the federal reserve did a week and a half ago _meta_end_dot_

 by well informed i mean someone who regularly reads newspapers and watches or listens to broadcast news she s quite likely to tell you that the federal reserve expended _meta_dollor_ref_ billion in taxpayer funds in order to purchase a large amount of worthless mortgage backed securities from the bear stearns companies _meta_end_dot_

 she may have connected enough dots to believe that jp morgan would have refused to acquire bear without the _meta_dollor_ref_ billion lollipop _meta_end_dot_

 and a lot of angry questions are probably now circling around in our well informed average person s head _meta_end_dot_

 first and foremost of which is how on earth did _meta_dollor_ref_ billion of my money get stuffed into the pockets of some gazillionaire wall street fatcats in the middle of the night without so much as a vote in congress _meta_end_question_

 i m nothing short of amazed at the array of economics phds and other quite expert people who are jumping into news interviews to create just exactly this impression _meta_end_dot_

 the clamor for immediate new regulations of the financial industry is already starting _meta_end_dot_

 and there are spillover effects too hillary clinton just called for a total of _meta_dollor_ref_ billion to be paid out to people who are having trouble with their mortgages _meta_end_dot_

 wonder where she got that number from considering that her previous proposal was only for a billion or two _meta_end_question_

 what s the truth of the matter _meta_end_question_

 there s not enough information to fully answer the question _meta_end_dot_

 let me tell you what we know for sure _meta_end_dot_

 more _meta_end_dot_

 bear stearns unraveled so fast on march _meta_number_ref_ and _meta_number_ref_ that the fed felt compelled to find a buyer for the company before financial markets in asia opened for trading on the _meta_number_ref_th _meta_end_dot_

 that meant a deal had to be made and announced by around dinnertime in new york on the _meta_number_ref_th _meta_end_dot_

 luckily and i really mean that jp morgan chase was available _meta_end_dot_

 unlike other large commercial banks they were not in the throes of already trying to do a large acquisition and they had a very strong balance sheet _meta_end_dot_

 so over a very tense weekend of non stop negotiating two different and difficult things had to be done _meta_end_dot_

 first deal terms had to be negotiated and drafted _meta_end_dot_

 and the lawyers evidently made some wicked and significant errors too second a minimal amount of due diligence had to be done on the assets of bear stearns prior to the acquisition _meta_end_dot_

 i wasn t present in any of those meetings and i ve heard all the rumors and innuendo about how the negotiations went _meta_end_dot_

 i m on record here at redstate before the weekend started as believing that the acquisition value of bear would be zero _meta_end_dot_

 i felt the _meta_dollor_ref_ share price that eventually was agreed upon was a face saving sop to bear executives _meta_end_dot_

 that s because by rights it should take two or three calm weeks to do a proper due diligence _meta_end_dot_

 instead morgan had one and a half extremely tense days over a weekend with no prep and with the new york fed crawling up their anal openings the whole time _meta_end_dot_

 you can t properly evaluate a portfolio under conditions like that _meta_end_dot_

 in dimon s place i would have offered zero for bear rather than _meta_dollor_ref_ share _meta_end_dot_

 remember morgan committed to assume the obligations of an essentially unknown portfolio that including derivatives had a nominal value in the trillions of dollars _meta_end_dot_

 what did the fed do to sweeten the deal _meta_end_question_

 they did not commit to take _meta_number_ref_ billion dollars worth of toxic waste off morgan s hands _meta_end_dot_

 what they appear to have done is to establish a limited liability entity to take control over _meta_dollor_ref_ billion worth of securities no word yet on what the securities actually are _meta_end_dot_

 according to statements by the new york fed morgan is responsible for _meta_dollor_ref_ billion in potential losses on the _meta_dollor_ref_ billion portfolio _meta_end_dot_

 if there are profits on the portfolio the fed will receive about _meta_percent_ref_ of them and morgan will get the rest _meta_end_dot_

 i haven t yet been able to find out the answers to a range of crucial questions about this structure _meta_end_dot_

 based on fragmentary information my guess is that the fed formed a spinoff entity to enter into a _meta_number_ref_ day repurchase agreement with morgan to buy a package of securities with a face value of _meta_dollor_ref_ billion _meta_end_dot_

 that would be enough time to do a proper due diligence and valuation of the portfolio _meta_end_dot_

 assuming i m right and i have no way to tell how likely that is after the _meta_number_ref_ days of which today is the ninth the fed s spinoff entity will resell the securities back to morgan in return for _meta_dollor_ref_ billion plus some amount of interest _meta_end_dot_

 if morgan fails to execute the repo then the fed s spinoff entity will go into the market and find a buyer for the paper _meta_end_dot_

 if that happens they will either have a profit or a loss on the transaction _meta_end_dot_

 the profit or loss will accrue to the fed s account not to the treasury or the taxpayers and they will presumably execute some offsetting transactions subsequently to sterilize the effect of the failed repo on the overall money supply _meta_end_dot_

 ok i could be totally wrong about all this _meta_end_dot_

 i welcome any and all corrections that are based on solid information _meta_end_dot_

 i ve been trying to reach people at the new york fed to give me some more detail _meta_end_dot_

 so far they haven t gotten back to me _meta_end_dot_

 if i ve guessed right however then there has been no expenditure of public money nor will there be _meta_end_dot_

 on the other hand this whole episode has been a golden opportunity for people who are looking for reasons for the government to take more control over wall street _meta_end_dot_

 as i ve said in other recent posts we do need more regulation on wall street _meta_end_dot_

 but no one really knows the best way to do it yet _meta_end_dot_

 and it doesn t help to get misleading explanations from people who really ought to know better _meta_end_dot_

 they should be ashamed of themselves _meta_end_dot_
