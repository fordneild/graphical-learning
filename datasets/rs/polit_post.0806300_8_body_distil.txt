  were you doing that sliders dimension hopping fanfic cosplay thing again _meta_end_question_

 originally via riehl world view although the comments section gave me pause anyway when did we start doing this _meta_end_question_

 in fact why did we start doing this _meta_end_question_

 even if the current presidential administration actually had taken the rather insensitive and bigoted assumption that arab islamist note suffix terrorist terrorist sympathizer which might i note is a very difficult charge to make against the bush administration while still keeping a straight face much to the disappointment of various and sundry progressive masochism fetishists it remains true that the vast majority of arab americans are not muslims and that the vast majority of american muslims are not arabs _meta_end_dot_

 i somehow doubt that the government can be simultaneously dumb enough to carry out a boneheaded policy of rounding up arab american families while at the same time being clever enough to simultaneously keep it off of the nightly news and not manage to round up maronites by mistake _meta_end_dot_

 pause look them up senator _meta_end_dot_

 then explain the difference to your acolytes _meta_end_dot_

 it apparently doesn t register with them unless you say it _meta_end_dot_
