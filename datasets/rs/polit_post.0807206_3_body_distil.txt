  erik sofge virtually peed on the late e _meta_end_dot_

 gary gygax s grave yesterday with an attack on the family man and innovator that is so ridiculous i hardly know where to begin _meta_end_dot_

 so i ll just walk through the article bit by bit and pick it apart _meta_end_dot_

 from the first paragraph sofge sets the tone _meta_end_dot_

 this is no mere opinion _meta_end_dot_

 this is a personal grudge against someone or something _meta_end_dot_

 the man believes there s something fundamentally wrong with role playing games _meta_end_dot_

 if a group of men get together for an evening of harmless fun engaging in a mental and social game there is something amiss _meta_end_dot_

 sofge is embarrassed that he didn t instead engage in the hedonistic culture pushed by hollywood _meta_end_dot_

 you see he apparently thinks young men should be out in bars trying to have promiscuous sex rather than take part in celibate activities _meta_end_dot_

 of course below that we find the assumption that these games are played only by men _meta_end_dot_

 of course it s not true but why does sofge think it _meta_end_question_

 is there something about the way he acted that drove women away from his games _meta_end_question_

 who knows _meta_end_dot_

 but women do play rpgs so there must be something going on behind the scenes here _meta_end_dot_

 read on _meta_end_dot_

 wasn t a visionary _meta_end_question_

 maybe it seems obvious now but so many good ideas are but gygax took a huge step when he made the leap from his first game chainmail to the granddaddy of role playing games dungeons dragons _meta_end_dot_

 in those days people played war games with miniatures and chainmail was a set of rules for medieval fantasy miniatures games _meta_end_dot_

 d d did away with the need for miniatures and expanded beyond combat with the imaginations of the players which allowed all involved to get away from pure hack and slash combat and into parleys puzzles exploration politics romance and everything else that can come up in the life of a fantasy adventurer _meta_end_dot_

 but no let s not give him credit _meta_end_dot_

 let s compare his genre creating work with the works of those who built on it _meta_end_dot_

 isaac newton _meta_end_question_

 a lousy physicist _meta_end_dot_

 sure he came up with the inverse square law of gravitation but later physicists like albert einstein came up with more accurate theories _meta_end_dot_

 newton was just a hack and shouldn t be remembered so fondly _meta_end_dot_

 and again we have another hint of some other deep seated antipathy driving the article _meta_end_dot_

 where on earth did this grudge against star trek conventioneers come from _meta_end_question_

 i guess people who go beyond sitting and staring at the television screen and meet people outside their homes are just to weird for sofge to deal with _meta_end_dot_

 hold onto that thought though remember online computer games are killing rpgs says sofge and it s all gygax s fault for inventing d d _meta_end_dot_

 excuse me for a moment your writer has to go clean his computer monitor _meta_end_dot_

 he just left some saliva all over it sputtering at how brazenly sofge did a complete _meta_number_ref_ from paragraph to paragraph without even acknowledging it _meta_end_dot_

 squeak squeak there that s better _meta_end_dot_

 but look at it d d losing out to video games was a sign of weakness but now d d is bad because it apparently is just like those video games _meta_end_exclamation_

 and while it s true i did find it frustrating when i first encountered the d d basic set that elves had no classes but so did gygax _meta_end_exclamation_

 that s why he later turned around and created advanced dungeons dragons _meta_end_dot_

 but i digress _meta_end_dot_

 we now get a hint though about why sofge has so much pent up anger and resentment for rpg players _meta_end_dot_

 he and his group just weren t playing it right _meta_end_dot_

 they tried to play a simple hack and slash game with no depth and oh role playing and then got frustrated _meta_end_dot_

 the whole point of d d was to expand on it _meta_end_dot_

 the original ruleset didn t even include complete combat rules _meta_end_exclamation_

 it took chainmail and added imagination _meta_end_dot_

 quoting gygax himself in the rulebook so i don t know what game sofge was playing but it wasn t d d _meta_end_dot_

 back to his article though see there we go again _meta_end_dot_

 because his group went around slitting throats instead of roleplaying he assumes everyone else did too _meta_end_dot_

 contrast with others view of the original d d though and how does ad d discuss experience for roleplaying _meta_end_question_

 let s quote the second edition player s handbook as that s what i have handy so again sofge didn t play the game right so he attacks gygax and makes the man s major work out to be something wicked _meta_end_dot_

 he also can t even get tolkien right _meta_end_dot_

 christopher tolkien notes in the silmarillion that his father had already begun work on his mythology for england as far back as _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 and this mythology consistently draws not from the current events of the late _meta_number_ref_s and early _meta_number_ref_s but from the bible _meta_end_dot_

 from the trinity of eru manwe gandalf to the great flood of n menor to the death and resurrection of gandalf for the peoples of middle earth of whom the fellowship of the ring was a microcosm j _meta_end_dot_

 r _meta_end_dot_

 r _meta_end_dot_

 tolkien retold the story of christianity in his books _meta_end_dot_

 while it s certainly true that the lord of the rings was influenced by the horrors of war in which christopher was fighting in the raf as page by page of the story was written and sent to him and the man himself knew death from the great war by _meta_number_ref_ all but one of my close friends were dead to strip the christianity from the lord of the rings and make it a topical allegory is to miss the point _meta_end_dot_

 but that s not entirely surprising _meta_end_dot_

 erik sofge misses the point of the lord of the rings of dungeons dragons and he absolutely picks the wrong time to kick dirt on the record of a beloved man who just passed on _meta_end_dot_
