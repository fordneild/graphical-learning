  america is not ready to elect a black president or so a major daily tells us _meta_end_dot_

 could this be the new york times making a last minute push for hillary _meta_end_question_

 maybe the philadelphia inquirer making early excuses for barry _meta_end_question_

 nah _meta_end_dot_

 that sentiment comes to us from those who d know the venerable times of london _meta_end_dot_

 in the uk no less _meta_end_dot_

 that s from anatole kaletsky described by the broadsheet as o ne of the country s leading commentators on economics not on america _meta_end_dot_

 not on sociology _meta_end_dot_

 not on political science _meta_end_dot_

 nope he s a brit who writes about the economy _meta_end_dot_

 please read on _meta_end_dot_

 this entire set of dem primaries was calibrated by the dem party leadership to allow dem voters the belief that they were selecting their party s nominee when it would really be chosen by the fat cats in capes bearing cigars in the back rooms _meta_end_dot_

 superdelegates democrats are currently aware that america is not ready to elect an african american for the top job _meta_end_question_

 then why is obama running _meta_end_question_

 why is obama winning _meta_end_question_

 why does obama have any fat cat superdelegate support _meta_end_question_

 no he offers no evidence to back his contention rather he sees what is coming and is dare i say bitter _meta_end_dot_

 bitter bitter bitter _meta_end_dot_

 i m in tears _meta_end_dot_

 the poor brit does not much like the presidents america elects and perhaps he would like us instead to install a monarchy _meta_end_dot_

 the american can t be trusted to vote for the most qualified candidate the brit economic commentator whines to his countrymen and the monarchy has worked so well for the united kingdom _meta_end_dot_

 john mccain is the only one of our three remaining candidate s who is truly qualified to handle all aspects of the presidency without winging it but we must be condemned for this he cites jeremiah wright and bittergate as two reasons this is the case _meta_end_dot_

 neither of his examples has to do with any candidate s race rather they reflect the candidate s contempt for america and for americans _meta_end_dot_

 he has a solution though if that ticket were to sweep all before it then obama would run in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ would be hillary s second term _meta_end_dot_

 but this sweep all before it business is a na ve fantasy of a raving british economic commentator _meta_end_dot_

 more importantly the professional democratic politicians cannot force the two candidates to do a damn thing together _meta_end_dot_

 here in the states we don t have a queen _meta_end_dot_

 neener neener neener _meta_end_dot_
