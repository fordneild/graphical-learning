  gilad shalit corporal in the idf s armor corps was taken hostage by hamas on june _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 hamas was apparently convinced that their bold move to cross into israel and kidnap a soldier might be enough to force israel to trade the freedom of women and youths from israeli jails for shalit s own freedom _meta_end_dot_

 h t michelle malkin israel said no _meta_end_dot_

 sixteen days later our lebanese friends hizbullah saw the opportunity to fire rockets into israel and take two of their very own israeli soldiers hostage planning to use them again _meta_end_dot_

 as bargaining chips _meta_end_dot_

 eldad regev and ehud goldwasser were taken on july _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 like shalit regev and goldwasser remain in captivity today _meta_end_dot_

 a war was fought over these kidnappings _meta_end_dot_

 israel fought it poorly in the eyes of some israelis and others around the world and those who side with the arabs in this multi generational holy war watched with glee as israel was knee capped by the un having been promised they would get their soldiers back in exchange for ending hostilities _meta_end_dot_

 the hostilities ended and israel lived up to their promises _meta_end_dot_

 hamas and hizbullah did not and these men remain in captivity _meta_end_dot_

 so much for the un _meta_end_dot_

 and so much for keeping your word at the bargaining table _meta_end_dot_

 apparently israel and their terrorist neighbors are held to different standards _meta_end_dot_

 and the un drumbeat of lies and moving targets for international justice and security blathers on _meta_end_dot_

 the rest of us might have moved on but israel hasn t forgotten nor has the families of these men _meta_end_dot_

 hamas hasn t forgotten either dredging up shalit s name anew in hopes of convincing israel to attack only military targets promising they will do likewise and return cpl _meta_end_dot_

 shalit to his family s awaiting arms _meta_end_dot_

 don t count on it happening and don t count on hearing anything about it from the media or the un _meta_end_dot_

 everyone else save for the shalit family the goldwasser family and the regev family has long since moved on _meta_end_dot_

 i remember them today and my prayers remain with these men and their families two years running _meta_end_dot_
