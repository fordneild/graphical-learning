  it s time for someone to inform the admiral of the democratic fleet that the shields have failed _meta_end_dot_

 barack obama now joins john kerry on the list of democratic presidential hopefuls who relied on a sympathetic liberal media to shield them from the effects of bad news only to find out the hard way that the shields no longer work _meta_end_dot_

 there was a time not so long ago when a monolithic partisan media by the simple expedient of ignoring news about their candidate that they didn t like could keep a pretty tight lid on oh some swift boat vets from the _meta_number_ref_ s who retained unflattering memories of john kerry _meta_end_dot_

 or a firebrand preacher from the _meta_number_ref_ s who sounds like moveon org on racism _meta_end_dot_

 in both cases the conventional wisdom of the democratic campaign staffs honed over long decades of never having to worry about such things was to ignore the smoke in the certainty that the fire would be snuffed out before anyone noticed _meta_end_dot_

 for a while it appeared at least to democrats that the shields were holding _meta_end_dot_

 nothing they saw in their own media indicated otherwise _meta_end_dot_

 bill moyers always a reliable shill for democratic interests played the role that _meta_number_ref_ minutes had played in the campaign of bill clinton moyers staged a softball interview show that allowed the left reverend to position himself as a terribly wronged holy man whose words were being butchered for political gain by _meta_end_dot_

 you know _meta_end_dot_

 them _meta_end_dot_

 democratic leaning journalists proffered that obama s latest action whichever one it was had ended the matter _meta_end_dot_

 that act grew tiresome as obama kept having to try things one after another but the journalists gamely went along like the good democratic soldiers that they are _meta_end_dot_

 john kerry could have told the obama staffers how christmas in cambodia ghenkis khan and the magic hat came right through the shields _meta_end_dot_

 like obama kerry had ignored the photon torpedoes in the belief they could not hit him _meta_end_dot_

 but they did _meta_end_dot_

 and now they have hit obama and they have hit him in the polls _meta_end_dot_

 this is a good thing _meta_end_dot_

 having the machinery of news dissemination firmly in the hands of partisans of one party was never one of the best things about american politics _meta_end_dot_

 having those partisans actively participating in our elections as propagandists spiking bad news about one party s candidates while trumpeting and in some cases fabricating bad news about the opponents was surely one of the worst things about our politics _meta_end_dot_

 now that it no longer works perhaps our journalists will return to reporting the news instead of trying to manage it _meta_end_dot_

 and maybe pigs will fly _meta_end_dot_
