  earlier i wrote about an egregiously dishonest editorial by the new york times and asked why does the campaign even bother with the nyt _meta_end_question_

 why even invite them on the bus and plane anymore _meta_end_dot_

 the campaign doesn t invite the dnc why its surrogate the underlying issue has to do with when john mccain s campaign releases his health records _meta_end_dot_

 the campaign has promised the _meta_number_ref_rd _meta_end_dot_

 well _meta_end_dot_

 ed morrissey has found out that the mccain campaign was not going to invite the new york times to the press conference _meta_end_dot_

 and they aren t happy about it _meta_end_dot_

 in fact they threatened the campaign _meta_end_dot_

 deets after the jump _meta_end_dot_

 here s what ed s got bravo to the mccain campaign for getting in front of this _meta_end_dot_

 at least it will be clear to everyone that the nyt is printing a smear job before an editor even gets a copy _meta_end_dot_

 maybe the nyt will impress us _meta_end_dot_

 but i doubt it _meta_end_dot_
