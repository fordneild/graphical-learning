  in what will no doubt relieve the the obama campaign two new polls have come through with two solid double digit wins for him in oregon _meta_end_dot_

 always a thrill a minute for our democratic colleagues huh _meta_end_question_

 moe lane good morning _meta_end_dot_

 we have received reports showing concern over american research group s forecast yesterday of _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ the obama in oregon and _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ clinton in kentucky _meta_end_dot_

 we would like to remind our operatives that arg has been notoriously bad this election cycle in picking a winner so be sure to mention that often _meta_end_dot_

 particularly since according to suffolk it s _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ the obama in oregon and _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ clinton in kentucky _meta_end_dot_

 accordingly please be sure to also use the words outlier and statistical blips emphasize that oregon uses exclusively a mail in ballot immediately switch to a narrative where the obama was always going to have a fight in oregon and of course redouble all efforts to insist that a bare majority of pledged delegates in a reduced primary total gives the obama a moral right to his party s nomination _meta_end_dot_

 thank you for your attention in this matter _meta_end_dot_

 hope and change the the obama campaign ps and for the love of barack don t talk about thermostat regulation _meta_end_dot_

 people are going to wonder why we even care given the whole global warming thing _meta_end_dot_
