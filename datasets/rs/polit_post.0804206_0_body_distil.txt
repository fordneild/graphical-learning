  barack obama is surely pleased with his performance as he should be _meta_end_dot_

 his campaign now has the clinton people on their heels and while the clintons expect to recover in march as primaries take the place of caucuses and as the contests move to states with small african american populations the danger for the clinton people is that obama will have created so much momentum for himself that these changes in the race will not matter as much _meta_end_dot_

 that momentum along with obama s money advantage ought to ensure that at the very least hillary clinton will not win the democratic presidential nomination on the first ballot _meta_end_dot_

 there will be trench warfare for superdelegates within short order _meta_end_dot_

 for any political junkie this ought to be fun to watch _meta_end_dot_

 as for the republicans mike huckabee hangs on and had a good day yesterday _meta_end_dot_

 but as cnn pointed out last night even if huckabee wins every contest with _meta_percent_ref_ of the vote each time from here on out it will not be enough to prevent mccain from getting to the magic number of _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ delegates _meta_end_dot_

 huckabee did say that he felt that mccain would benefit from having a sparring partner _meta_end_dot_

 and that is all the former arkansas governor will end up being at the end _meta_end_dot_
