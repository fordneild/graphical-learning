  hope is a lovely thing but when hope is used as a cover for weakness it doesn t take long for others to catch on _meta_end_dot_

 after having lived a charmed political existence barack obama suddenly finds that others may have caught on to his political weaknesses but just as clinton cannot win the nomination outright neither can obama _meta_end_dot_

 and even though a number of superdelegates are moving towards him that movement may slow if they perceive any further signs that obama possesses a glass jaw _meta_end_dot_

 behind as clinton is she can still wreak havoc on the process and if there is power to be had rest assured that she will _meta_end_dot_

 and thus this lumbering and clumsy primary continues _meta_end_dot_

 not that i am complaining this is the greatest show on earth and i certainly do not want to see it end anytime soon _meta_end_dot_
