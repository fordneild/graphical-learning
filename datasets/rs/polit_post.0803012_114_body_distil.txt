  the commerce department reports this morning that the us economy grew at an annual rate of _meta_number_ref_ _meta_percent_ref_ in the fourth quarter of _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 this preliminary estimate which will be revised twice in coming months was about half the rate expected by many economists _meta_end_dot_

 keep in mind that this is a look backward rather than forward in time _meta_end_dot_

 still it s a big disappointment _meta_end_dot_

 you probably recall that the economy grew at an annualized _meta_number_ref_ _meta_percent_ref_ in the third quarter _meta_end_dot_

 the weakness was across the board with all categories consumer spending inventories capital spending by business and exports performing well below q_meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 there really weren t any bright spots _meta_end_dot_

 the preliminary estimated gdp growth for all of _meta_number_ref_ came in at _meta_number_ref_ _meta_percent_ref_ slightly above the _meta_percent_ref_ that i ve been predicting since early last year _meta_end_dot_

 read on for a bit of analysis _meta_end_dot_

 it seems clear that the us economy is in for a soft patch which will probably last several years _meta_end_dot_

 i m avoiding the word recession for a couple of good reasons _meta_end_dot_

 first as i ve said elsewhere i m already spotting signals that the credit market conditions are beginning to ease around the world _meta_end_dot_

 we ve been in a recession and it s already nearly over _meta_end_dot_

 i expect that gdp indicators will turn upward either in the current quarter or in q_meta_number_ref_ of _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 keep your eyes on inventory levels _meta_end_dot_

 these shrunk so much during q_meta_number_ref_ that they will necessarily generate at least some growth in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 second the softness in the us economy is secular rather than cyclical _meta_end_dot_

 much of the organic dynamism if you will in the us economy has come from illegal immigration _meta_end_dot_

 and much of that has been catalyzed by the now ended boom in housing _meta_end_dot_

 both factors have now largely been washed out of the picture _meta_end_dot_

 the sectors of the us economy that we need to look to for growth leadership now are healthcare and government _meta_end_dot_

 neither one is likely to generate above market rates of return on capital _meta_end_dot_

 the real growth is happening elsewhere in the world _meta_end_dot_

 additionally the financial world is at a crossroads _meta_end_dot_

 we ve been through a global crisis that has many questioning the dogmas of modern portfolio theory most particularly statistical risk management and the so called value at risk models _meta_end_dot_

 since greed knows no bounds there is almost certainly a raft of hot young phd physicists and mathematicians quietly trying to figure out the next big money machine to follow mortgage backed securities _meta_end_dot_

 but there also are a great many institutional portfolio managers who are questioning their whole approach to risk _meta_end_dot_

 and these people will wait for leadership _meta_end_dot_

 the amount of capital available for business growth in the developed countries will probably lag behind its historical trend for the next several years _meta_end_dot_

 this is a big part of why the us economy will keep growing but at a muted pace _meta_end_dot_

 it s also why the us government will continue to be one of the world s most popular investments _meta_end_dot_

 the outlook for us financial markets is mixed on this news _meta_end_dot_

 stock markets will fall on what is perceived to be a dimmer outlook for corporate earnings _meta_end_dot_

 the bond markets and currency markets have barely moved _meta_end_dot_

 all eyes continue to focus on the federal reserve s open market committee which is widely expected to cut interest rates again today at their regular meeting _meta_end_dot_
