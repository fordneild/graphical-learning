  if you ignore the inherent contradictions faulty logic unique read petulantly truculent interpretation of historical events and general flavor of panic _meta_end_dot_

 well you d be just like all the regular readers of alternet _meta_end_dot_

 you d also be in a position to almost say this was a half decent article with something resembling a straight face _meta_end_dot_

 after walking through three of the four major factions in the fighting and how three don t want us to actually leave the author both gingerly and tacitly does something startling he questions the patriotism of some of the people opposing the war _meta_end_dot_

 no of course he doesn t come out and say so _meta_end_dot_

 that would require moral courage _meta_end_dot_

 but he certainly questions their motivations _meta_end_dot_

 read we ll continue this after the fold _meta_end_dot_

 read on _meta_end_dot_

 alas the author of the piece eventually falls back into inanity _meta_end_dot_

 he seems to be of the opinion that leaving as soon as possible is functionally equivalent to leaving as soon as we re done which i suppose that he has to in order to justify that earlier babbling on about pushing for an acceleration of the momentum for withdrawal that s not as funny as his bald faced assertion that the us government s past actions were so horrible that it will be unable to create a working political settlement _meta_end_dot_

 actually no it s not funny after all _meta_end_dot_

 the implications of the thought processes of the people using that argument are appalling to contemplate_meta_beep_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 but let us pass on beyond that objection and contemplate the implications _meta_end_dot_

 glenn reynolds who gets the hat tip seems to be taking the position that this is part of a general retreat on the war by the progressives and that it will actually hurt the republicans in the long term i see his point but color me unconvinced that enough of the antiwar movement is going to disengage in time _meta_end_dot_

 an examination of alternet s own comment section indicates a lot of fevered ranting about israel the war us horrible neocons the need for impeachment conspiracy theorizing of every shade and hue and the need for revolution these are not precisely the reactions that you would expect of a community ready to at least pretend that they are ready to change their behavior patterns to better reflect objective reality or indeed to reflect objective reality at all _meta_end_dot_

 these are are the reactions of a community grimly determined to keep doing the same thing over and over again in the hopes that something will change _meta_end_dot_

 and do you know something _meta_end_question_

 that doesn t bother me in the slightest _meta_end_dot_

 i want them staying fat dumb and unhappy until their own party puts the boot in _meta_end_dot_

 moe lane the fourth al queda in iraq is mostly too dead to have an opinion although the author of the article is obviously prepared to crawl naked over red hot broken glass before he ll give us the satisfaction of admitting that the us military might have had something to do with it _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_beep_ref_for the slow the first implication is that there are people stupid enough to actually believe that we have been worse than the hussein regime _meta_end_dot_

 the second implication is that those people also are incapable of understanding that the iraqi people cannot also tell the difference _meta_end_dot_

 the third implication is that we inexplicably permit people holding implications _meta_number_ref_ and _meta_number_ref_ to vote _meta_end_dot_

 hard to say which one s the worst of the batch _meta_end_dot_
