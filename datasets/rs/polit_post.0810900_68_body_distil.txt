  from the congressman s office you can see his letter below the fold and take advantage of the address for your own letter _meta_end_dot_

 sue naegle president _meta_number_ref_ avenue of the americas dear ms _meta_end_dot_

 naegle we are writing to express our outrage with commentator bill maher s offensive anti catholic rant on this past friday s real time program on hbo _meta_end_dot_

 mr _meta_end_dot_

 maher crossed the line of decency by insulting the pope mocking the catholic religion and catholics and diminishing the importance of the catholic faith _meta_end_dot_

 in a word mr _meta_end_dot_

 maher s commentary was vulgar _meta_end_dot_

 pope benedict xvi s historic visit to the united states is meant to build bridges to people of all faiths and spread goodwill in our nation and around the world _meta_end_dot_

 he has taken historic steps to bring people of all faiths together unite them in the cause of common good and break down the barriers that separate us _meta_end_dot_

 the pope has also used this opportunity to acknowledge mistakes of the past and heal the wounds they have caused _meta_end_dot_

 we believe individuals guilty of these crimes should be brought to justice and we appreciate the pope s apology for these events _meta_end_dot_

 while we do not dispute that mr _meta_end_dot_

 maher has an absolute right to express his opinions what good can really be achieved with such offensive and divisive language _meta_end_question_

 it was disgusting to hear mr _meta_end_dot_

 maher refer to the pope as an individual who not only operates outside the bounds of the law but he used to be a nazi and he wears funny hats mr _meta_end_dot_

 maher went on to call the catholic church a child abusing religious cult and concluded his diatribe with the statement that s what the catholic church is the bear stearns of organized pedophilia on behalf of the millions of catholics in the united states and throughout the world we are appalled by mr _meta_end_dot_

 maher s statements and the go along attitude of his guests who laughed and clapped through his anti catholic tirade _meta_end_dot_

 we are also disappointed in hbo for failing to denounce mr _meta_end_dot_

 maher s ranting and to ignore the fact that his hurtful words offended catholics in the united states and across the world _meta_end_dot_

 therefore we call upon hbo to acknowledge the offensive nature of mr _meta_end_dot_

 maher s remarks and to apologize for playing a role in spreading his anti catholic commentary _meta_end_dot_

 mr _meta_end_dot_

 maher has had a long record of mocking religion in general and the catholic church in particular _meta_end_dot_

 at this time when people of all faiths want to hear a message of peace and of healing mr _meta_end_dot_

 maher attempted to cast a dark cloud over the pope s visit _meta_end_dot_

 regardless the catholic religion will continue to foster faith forgiveness and goodness throughout our world and maybe that s a lesson mr _meta_end_dot_

 maher can learn from _meta_end_dot_
