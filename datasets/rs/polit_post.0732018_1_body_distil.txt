  roger simon says something that resonates with a thought that s been in my head for a while h t instapundit watching the video it s a bad sign when the audience laughs at your answer and you didn t want them to right _meta_end_question_

 read on _meta_end_dot_

 roger seems to be taking the position that senator obama is too inexperienced to be president that he himself knows it and is thus not making the effort he d need to overcome hillary _meta_end_dot_

 it s an interesting idea although in the end i can t quite agree with it _meta_end_dot_

 there is really no way to be experienced enough to be the president after all _meta_end_dot_

 sure every candidate in the race will be happy to tell you how their cv proves that they re fully prepared to do the job but they re all spinning i say that with no disapproval these people are trying to win an election after all _meta_end_dot_

 the job entails being the final authority for the welfare of _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ million people directly and the rest of the planet indirectly which also includes the responsibility of making sure that the human race survives to see tomorrow s sunrise _meta_end_dot_

 the president of the united states of america can wipe out human civilization above the township level in an afternoon _meta_end_dot_

 reduction of nuclear stocks or no _meta_end_dot_

 there is no adequate preparation for that kind of responsibility _meta_end_dot_

 so whether senator obama is experienced enough to be president is in some ways a moot point _meta_end_dot_

 whether he is experienced enough to campaign for president is not _meta_end_dot_

 i say this with no malice in my heart he s not _meta_end_dot_

 in a lot of ways this is his first real campaign on the federal level _meta_end_dot_

 his senatorial campaign in _meta_number_ref_ was more of a triumphal progression than anything else jack ryan s utter unfortunately deserved collapse made his election inevitable _meta_end_dot_

 now there s nothing wrong with taking what s offered to you if doing so won t touch upon your honor he was lucky enough to be able to take advantage of the situation and smart enough to do it _meta_end_dot_

 he would have been better off if he had had to make a fight of it though _meta_end_dot_

 because he s not playing in a crowd that will obligingly self destruct for his benefit and there s a limit to how far a friendly media will take you_meta_beep_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 now what he should have done was sit this one out _meta_end_dot_

 depending on how you look at it he should have either run in _meta_number_ref_ or _meta_number_ref_ for illinois governorship governor blagojevich was exceptionally vulnerable to a strong primary challenge and if obama had lost so what _meta_end_question_

 he could have tried again in _meta_number_ref_ blagojevich has rather bad numbers to put it mildly _meta_end_dot_

 a win either time would have put him in a very very good position for either _meta_number_ref_ or _meta_number_ref_ as he d be the governor of a large important state right age possessor of a powerful political machine with which to tap into and most importantly the experience to use all of this effectively _meta_end_dot_

 much better than a one term senator _meta_end_dot_

 so why couldn t he do this anyway after the nomination process is done _meta_end_question_

 because he s on most people s short list for a vp slot and if the ticket he s on loses he ll never ever be considered for a presidential slot again _meta_end_dot_

 i do not say that the democratic party eats babies but it does have a definite taste for consuming the flesh of its failed champions _meta_end_dot_

 and if he does refuse the vp slot it s going to sour a lot of activists on him particularly if the gop keeps the white house _meta_end_dot_

 so all in all bit of a wrong turn there what what _meta_end_question_

 moe lane i am a good party man but i have to say taking jeri ryan to a sex club when she doesn t want to go is not the sign of a fool _meta_end_dot_

 it s the sign of a damfool _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_beep_ref_oh he ll last past the first round he s this year s fresh faced outsider that speaks to the ordinary man and woman _meta_end_dot_

 howard dean can tell you how many delegates that translates to in the real world although i do believe that you should wait until he s in a good mood before you ask _meta_end_dot_
