  one thing that i find hard to judge following campaigns through the glorious interwebs is what a person s temperament is _meta_end_dot_

 rumors abound about a private icy coldness of hillary a jovial huckabee and an angry mccain but since the rumors are about how these people act in private it s hard to get first hand knowledge of their personality _meta_end_dot_

 after spending _meta_number_ref_ days with the mccain campaign i came to three conclusions about the senator s age and temperament _meta_end_dot_

 first the senator looks his age _meta_end_dot_

 i don t have to describe why you can look through these photos and compare them to the _meta_number_ref_ mccain _meta_end_dot_

 second besides his outward appearance there is no hint that the man is over _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 his energy level wit physical stamina and mental acuity are that of a man _meta_number_ref_ years younger _meta_end_dot_

 i never saw him slow down to catch his breath stop anywhere to sit down for a moment or even take time alone for a while to have some peace and quiet _meta_end_dot_

 third i never saw a hint of his rumored anger _meta_end_dot_

 granted we were in the presence of other media the whole time and this was only a _meta_number_ref_ day ride along but i saw no raising of his voice and no gruffness _meta_end_dot_

 he seemed to genuinely enjoy the process of talking to citizens campaigning answering questions and competing to win _meta_end_dot_
