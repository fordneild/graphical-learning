  one of the silver linings in all these attacks on john mccain s war record is that we re finally being reminded how much the left loathes the military _meta_end_dot_

 i think it is worth repeating that the left does not want to surrender to the enemy so much as they do not want our soldiers emboldened by victory _meta_end_dot_

 victory by american troops is anathema to the left _meta_end_dot_

 today another democrat gives away the game _meta_end_dot_

 geez if this is what they say about the man for sticking it out in the hanoi hilton imagine what they d say if he actually did fold and allow the commies their pr ploy of releasing the admiral s son _meta_end_dot_

 no shame _meta_end_dot_

 when will barack obama publicly say attacks on john mccain s war record are off limits _meta_end_question_
