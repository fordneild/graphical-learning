 i wish i could say i wasn t surprised but i am _meta_end_dot_

 i m shocked _meta_end_dot_

 democrat house speaker andy dillon and his team did their best to scuttle the whole thing by refusing to move a legislative fix but the said today it wasn t needed finding that the voter lists which go exclusively to the gop and dem state party operations the hang up for the lower courts helped the major parties advocate for candidates and issues an integral part of democracy _meta_end_dot_

 both the gop and the dems indicated that a court decision upholding the primary was all they needed to participate so there s no backing out now _meta_end_dot_

 michigan will now officially be the first large state to hold it s nominating contest the state becomes increasingly relevant on the national stage and the prospect for another presidential debate gets magnified _meta_end_dot_
