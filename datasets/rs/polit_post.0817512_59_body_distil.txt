  a photographic essay of obama propaganda and the media s willing assistance with it in america we have always been a skeptical people _meta_end_dot_

 one of our states even has a skeptical motto _meta_end_dot_

 missouri calls itself the show me state proving that missourians don t imagine they d be apt to have the wool pulled over their eyes too readily _meta_end_dot_

 consequently when most american citizens look at their politicians they usually view them through a prism of skepticism and since the assassination of john f _meta_end_dot_

 kennedy our skepticism has almost bordered on the irrational _meta_end_dot_

 photo with obama logo behind by reuters the american press has traditionally been even harder on our politicians and government than even the average american _meta_end_dot_

 since the first days of our country the press has savaged doubted dug up dirt and attacked our politicians seeming to never believe a word the pols say _meta_end_dot_

 from george washington to george bush the press has been at odds with politicians _meta_end_dot_

 yet for some unexplainable reason the pretentiousness and presumption of barack obama is being allowed to pass uncommented upon _meta_end_dot_

 the media especially is allowing him to make all sorts of claims that they should never allow anyone else to get away with _meta_end_dot_

 they are unquestioning with his claim to be the candidate of change and the candidate that will reach across the aisle neither claim can be substantiated by the man s career thus far _meta_end_dot_

 he does not reach across the aisle and he is responsible for no great program of change _meta_end_dot_

 a properly skeptical press would ask for the proof of obmam s claims but they merely smile and allow him to ramble on as if what he is saying is unassailable _meta_end_dot_

 but the media is especially compliant where it concerns the obama campaign s graphic designs displays that can be so easily compared to religious iconography or even old style communist propaganda _meta_end_dot_

 the overblown obscenely reverential posters featuring obama s upturned face in jesus like poses have gone uncommented upon by what should be a hard nosed doubtful media _meta_end_dot_

 these over the top graphic images in the form of posters and campaign literature design are amazing for their obvious propagandistic style yet the media seem not to find any reason to be off put by the absurdity of these graphics _meta_end_dot_

 nor have they noticed the campaign art s similarity to communist imagery _meta_end_dot_

 one can t help but wonder why this blatant re use of the graphic style used by stalin hitler and mao has raised not the slightest question in the minds of the american media _meta_end_question_

 obama s most recent graphic arrogance took the form of a faux great seal similar to the one seen on the podium of the president of the united states _meta_end_dot_

 on friday june _meta_number_ref_ obama met with a dozen democratic governors in chicago _meta_end_dot_

 the room featured a nice nameplate for each governor but in front of barack obama was displayed an amazing bit of presumption in the form of a seal saying obama for america and taking the form of an official seal the sort one might find from a government office _meta_end_dot_

 seal photo alex brandon associated press and the obama campaign has been inundated with helpful citizen propagandists like los angeles based street artist shepard fairey who is responsible for creating the ubiquitous hope poster the poster that started a rash of artists and designers hoping to catch the obama wave to fame _meta_end_dot_

 the hope poster has a companion poster progress _meta_end_dot_

 as well as the similar change version _meta_end_dot_

 but there are many others out there _meta_end_dot_

 and all of them seem to evoke the graphic tradition of communist propaganda _meta_end_dot_

 one has but to view a few communist posters meant to keep the people reminded of the god like status of their communist dictators and oppressors to see the stunning similarity that the obama posters reveal with their communist progenitors _meta_end_dot_

 it s impossible to view these communist posters without seeing how they resemble the obama campaign posters _meta_end_dot_

 of course it is one thing that the obama campaign itself has so easily expressed its inner propagandist emulating communist graphics _meta_end_dot_

 after all they are certainly free to do as they like with their own image _meta_end_dot_

 however that the media has seen fit not to comment on obama s absurd artistic pretensions is bad enough but to make matters worse the media has been lending the obama campaign assistance in turning barack obama from mere politician to religious icon on top of the campaign s own communist inspired graphics _meta_end_dot_

 let s take a look at how cuba s fidel castro was once depicted by his supporters for instance _meta_end_dot_

 here are two images from a _meta_number_ref_ magazine called bohemia where castro was drawn in christ like poses face upturned a pious look upon his benevolent countenance _meta_end_dot_

 one might laugh if castro s murderous regime wasn t so serious _meta_end_dot_

 but the media has also made of obama a sort of religious icon with magazine covers like newsweek _meta_end_dot_

 time _meta_end_dot_

 and rolling stone _meta_end_dot_

 of course it isn t just magazines that have given obama the benefit of the look of a messiah _meta_end_dot_

 one might possibly excuse a magazine because they are it might be remembered in the business of selling magazines _meta_end_dot_

 a flashy cover might just make those issues fly off the stands a bit more of course _meta_end_dot_

 but what about the news wires and newspapers _meta_end_question_

 aren t they supposed to be less interested in pure capitalism and more interested in the real news _meta_end_question_

 shouldn t they be less inclined to fall for obamania _meta_end_question_

 sadly it looks like they are swooning for barack obama as badly as the street artists and magazine sellers _meta_end_dot_

 so not to be left out reuters the associated press and various other news services news papers and media outlets have joined in to portray obama in all sorts of images that recall religious iconography _meta_end_dot_

 some images seem to show obama with a halo _meta_end_dot_

 or preaching from the pulpit _meta_end_dot_

 surrounded by worshippers seeking his touch as if he were a faith healer _meta_end_dot_

 juxtaposed with religious symbols _meta_end_dot_

 or in otherwise ethereal poses _meta_end_dot_

 one has to wonder why an otherwise hard bitten cynical media establishment is allowing itself to be so used in this way _meta_end_question_

 the obvious answer of course is that the media is not an observer not a reporter or commentator on american politics _meta_end_dot_

 the media is an active participant and they have chosen sides _meta_end_dot_

 they have joined the barack obama team and are more than happy to put their normal cynicism aside to help barack obama to achieve elevation from a junior senator with little experience with nothing to sell to president of the united states of america _meta_end_dot_

 i d love to say that the small handful of photos i ve included in this report is all there is to the obamification of the media _meta_end_dot_

 unfortunately what i presented here is but a tiny handful of examples _meta_end_dot_

 the media have become the obama campaign s propaganda arm in perfect emulation of the most blatant examples of human history _meta_end_dot_

 but for all those other examples at least they were generally under the thumb of an oppressive despotic government of one sort or another _meta_end_dot_

 this time it is the supposed free and open press acting the part of propaganda minister _meta_end_dot_
