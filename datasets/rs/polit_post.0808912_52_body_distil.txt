  update by neil stevens if i may chime in i submit that this may be related to a growing islamic split between the bulk of the arab world and the persian axis of iran and its clients syria hamas hezbollah and other terrorists _meta_end_dot_

 muslim troops from the united arab emirates uae an arab country have been operating in afghanistan as part of the united states led coalition for five years _meta_end_dot_

 their role is mainly humanitarian but the emirati troops have been involved in full scale military operations taking part in dangerous missions alongside us troops and on occasion fighting their way out of taleban ambushes _meta_end_dot_

 please read on _meta_end_dot_

 as fellow muslims the emirati troops get a warm reception from afghan villagers the fact that an arab muslim army has been operating alongside americans in afghanistan for five years is a surprise _meta_end_dot_

 until now the emirati deployment has been kept so secret that not even their own countrymen knew they were here _meta_end_dot_

 i m glad the cat is out of the bag _meta_end_dot_

 maybe we will see more muslim assistance in the struggle against islamic extremists _meta_end_dot_
