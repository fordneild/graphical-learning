  by now we should be used to stories like this one in which mainstream media journalists warn us with ever so much tut tutting that republicans win presidential elections by planning onslaughts against democrats and scaring voters thus fostering and furthering a narrative that states that democratic victories are triumphs of light and truth while republican victories are illegitimate and only come about because the sheeple are too terrified to vote the other way _meta_end_dot_

 added to this narrative is an epic poem to the wonderfulness of senator obama _meta_end_dot_

 i am sure that senator obama is a very nice and charming guy but good grief no one is perfect and there are plenty of things that could be pointed about about senator obama s personality and character that would conflict with the hagiography that has been drawn up concerning him _meta_end_dot_

 all of this is fatuous nonsense and i would call it various other things as well if this was not a family blog _meta_end_dot_

 don t tell me that democrats don t run fear campaigns on a regular basis the desperate need to reform entitlements like social security and medicare is sidetracked because of democratic fear mongering that republicans are out to take away the pensions of seniors or the health care of old people _meta_end_dot_

 free trade in general and pacts like nafta in particular have been dazzlingly successful in bringing about greater prosperity but you wouldn t know if from listening to hillary clinton barack obama and others in the democratic party link the implementation of free trade policies to widespread job losses and economic downturns with no evidence or substantiation whatsoever mind you _meta_end_dot_

 the economy has thus far avoided contracting unemployment is at a very low _meta_percent_ref_ with the employment picture actually picking up and _meta_percent_ref_ of homeowners are still able to pay their mortgages but the facts are ignored you would think that we are in the throes of yet another great depression _meta_end_dot_

 the surge and the implementation of the counterinsurgency strategy have stabilized the situation in iraq but we are regularly told that we are losing or have lost there _meta_end_dot_

 and on and on and on _meta_end_dot_

 so you can understand the frustration of people like me who watch demagoguery get raised to an art form on the other side of the partisan divide while at the same time the mainstream media piously tries to convince us that democrats are fighting by marquis of queensbury rules while republicans are punching below the belt _meta_end_dot_

 the facts don t support this at all and while i have come to recognize that this lack of evidence is never an obstacle for the reality based community and its natural allies in the mainstream media i nevertheless don t have to like being lied to _meta_end_dot_

 and neither do the rest of you _meta_end_dot_
