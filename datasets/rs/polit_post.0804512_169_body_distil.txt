  cigar smoke filled back room deals plotting old white men _meta_end_dot_

 these are images the media and the democrats would have us believe are associated with republicans with cough neocons _meta_end_dot_

 except more and more we are learning that this is the democratic party at work _meta_end_dot_

 the media would never say it because it would speak ill of their chosen party but it says something deeply disturbing that the democratic party does not actually trust its base to select the nominee for their party _meta_end_dot_

 for all the talk of the republican party being controlled by a secretive world of schaifes and dobsons at least our electoral process for our nominee is wholly transparent _meta_end_dot_

 the los angeles times editorial board of all places begins to sound out what the base is starting to say in the democratic party read on _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 in other words the superdelegates were put in place because the base of the party is far to the left of the american electorate _meta_end_dot_

 the democrats needed a way to make sure their candidate was not a far left puppet of an out of touch base _meta_end_dot_

 and by and large it worked _meta_end_dot_

 the humorous part for us of course is that the system is breaking down _meta_end_dot_

 the superdelegates now might return the clintons to power after the base was ready to shrug them off _meta_end_dot_

 the base of course would prefer a candidate far to the left of hillary clinton a man who supported a burglar s right to sue a home owner when injured during the crime a man who wanted to deny medical care to infants who survived being aborted a man whose preferred foreign policy involves bombing pakistan and a man who would rather meet terrorist leaders in the white house than cross a picket line to meet with stephen colbert _meta_end_dot_

 more disturbing than the democratic party not actually trusting is base to select the nominee is that the party apparatus has legitimate cause for its distrust _meta_end_dot_
