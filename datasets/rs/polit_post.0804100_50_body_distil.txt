  huck wins ks caucus _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 huck and mccain are in a tight race in la primary where exit polls show a huck _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ win within the moe _meta_end_dot_

 wa gop caucus results are not coming in yet _meta_end_dot_

 on the d side obama won the wa caucus and the ne primary by roughly _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 the la exit polls show obama winning _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ but it will take some returns to corroborate that _meta_end_dot_

 la results here _meta_end_dot_

 wa results here _meta_end_dot_

 update obama wins la _meta_end_dot_

 cnn calls that la will not give _meta_percent_ref_ to huck or mccain thus this primary does not affect the delegate count at all _meta_end_dot_

 it s a big beauty contest and huck looks a tad bit prettier right now although the race hasn t been called _meta_end_dot_

 wa still not called but proving caucuses are silly paul has _meta_percent_ref_ currently _meta_end_dot_
