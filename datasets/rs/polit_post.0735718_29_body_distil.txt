  update by pejman we are going to get a report from finnegan discussing just how lazy bill clinton is as a campaigner right _meta_end_question_

 anyone _meta_end_question_

 anyone _meta_end_question_

 bueller _meta_end_question_

 and now heeeeeere s erick _meta_end_exclamation_

 michael finnegan hates fred thompson _meta_end_dot_

 i think that is objectively so _meta_end_dot_

 he tried pushing the fred as abortion lawyer story months ago only to have it blow up in his face _meta_end_dot_

 so now he s pushing the fred as disaster story _meta_end_dot_

 again he s doing it for the los angeles times _meta_end_dot_

 remember the times has feared fred for months _meta_end_dot_

 when fred was just thinking about running the la times ran a hit job on him for playing a racist character on the _meta_number_ref_ s show wiseguy for three episodes _meta_end_dot_

 that leads me back to finnegan s piece in the los angeles times which like roger simon s piece in the politico for which there was video evidence that simon reported nothing accurately completely gets the facts wrong _meta_end_dot_

 the whole day was scratched and not for thompson but for the people in iowa _meta_end_dot_

 the wind is as i type gusting over _meta_number_ref_ miles per hour in mason ia with a wind chill of _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ f _meta_end_dot_

 there s a _meta_percent_ref_ chance of more snow _meta_end_dot_

 des moines is having wind gusts of over _meta_number_ref_ mph with a peak at _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ a m _meta_end_dot_

 of near _meta_number_ref_ mph _meta_end_dot_

 oh and the wind chill is _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_f right now _meta_end_dot_

 and it s been that way _meta_end_dot_

 in fact what michael finnegan does not tell you is that while fred has been plowing through for days in weather like this finnegan showed up for exactly one day _meta_end_dot_

 and it just so happened to be the day they had to cancel events due to weather _meta_end_dot_

 here s the other thing the several dozen was between _meta_number_ref_ and _meta_number_ref_ people at the first event of the morning in weather similar to that which i ve just described _meta_end_dot_

 not only not accurate but it sure seems that between the two of them michael finnegan is much lazier than fred thompson _meta_end_dot_
