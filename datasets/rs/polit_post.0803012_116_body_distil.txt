  so here we are at the turn of the tide one vote from winning the court two to three good years from winning the largest stage of the war the pressures of the oval office at their dramatic peak _meta_end_dot_

 a critical moment in our nation s history time for an individual with the strength and courage to do what the moment demands _meta_end_dot_

 in _meta_number_ref_ i support john mccain _meta_end_dot_

 but but my friends say incredulously but john mccain is crazy perhaps i answer _meta_end_dot_

 but you say this as if it s a bad thing grab a drink and read on _meta_end_dot_

 it s true stubborn and irascible john mccain s living rendition of don quixote has been infuriating to watch _meta_end_dot_

 he always had a bit of the mad saint of the valley to him a quality that has only increased with age _meta_end_dot_

 his breaks from conservative doctrine are manifold but fewer in number than those of several of his fellow senators _meta_end_dot_

 yet mccain s breaks seem so much greater than those of say john warner why _meta_end_question_

 because when he goes on his separate path he damn well wants you to know it and know that he thinks you and his other conservative opponents to be inches from lucifer for your damnable orthodoxy _meta_end_dot_

 or as i like john mccain _meta_end_dot_

 he seems like the sort of guy you could have a beer with right up to the moment where he smashes the bottle on the table and jams it in your face over something you said six years ago it all used to have an endearing abe simpson quality to it dear mr _meta_end_dot_

 president there are too many states _meta_end_dot_

 please eliminate three but there is a ferocity that has emerged in recent years that has led to countless run ins of the sort staffers share in loud whispers after too many drinks _meta_end_dot_

 they tend to remind me less of the befuddled abe than of richard burton as henry viii responding to woolsey in defiance of rome how far would i go you ask _meta_end_question_

 i would cleave the earth in two like an apple and fling the halves into the void yet this is also what i ve always admired about mccain even if conservatives curse him in the course of legislative battle he is the same man whichever side he is on _meta_end_dot_

 he brings that same infuriating passion to our cause when his inner compass has led him to alliance _meta_end_dot_

 his support of the surge confounded the glitterati of the msm who gave him every opportunity to break with the president in a fashion that would ve led to countless more cover appearances for the late night self pleasuring of pimply interns of the new republic _meta_end_dot_

 and yet he could not be agreeable to them as tempting as the doyennes and the cameras were he rambled through grousing yet triumphant middle fingers raised to rumsfeld on the right and the new york times on the left _meta_end_dot_

 even if you dislike mccain you have to admit it was a glorious moment for him _meta_end_dot_

 of course there is another candidate who shared many of these admirable traits rudy giuliani _meta_end_dot_

 it might surprise a few of you to know that hizzoner was my first choice and first choice by a mile in this election _meta_end_dot_

 no rudy s not a full bore conservative but we thought george w _meta_end_dot_

 bush was and we ve all seen how that has turned out _meta_end_dot_

 the rationale for me was simple the next four years will be very very rough for the republican party as a whole _meta_end_dot_

 the next president will likely be working opposite large democrat majorities in the house and the senate _meta_end_dot_

 in such a scenario having a president who does not fear telling nancy pelosi to shove it in fact enjoys the very act and revels in the consequences is enormously advantageous _meta_end_dot_

 in new york city he survived by keeping his head on a swivel which is what you gotta do when you find yourself in a vicious cockfight _meta_end_dot_

 we could use that in washington _meta_end_dot_

 nearly two years ago i started working in a voluntary capacity alongside others to share the perspective of a dedicated social conservative with the nascent giuliani campaign arguing that with a few internally consistent moves rightward on matters of judicial policy rudy could establish himself as the consensus second choice for many social conservatives _meta_end_dot_

 he could issue a sterling call for a new federalism as dan mclaughlin has eloquently offered that while personally pro choice he believed roe to be bad law wrongly decided and that every american should have the right to have their voices heard on such an issue by voting in their state _meta_end_dot_

 he could argue that it was high time the federal government got back to the business of defending the country not squabbling over marriage and stem cell funding _meta_end_dot_

 with such a position i still believe that after brownback huckabee and others inevitably faded rudy could have been the consensus pick _meta_end_dot_

 of course rudy s campaign could easily ignore me or any of the other dirty web folks saying this but it was advice echoed publicly by genuinely smart people patrick ruffini michael barone and fred barnes among others _meta_end_dot_

 his campaign chose to ignore all this advice _meta_end_dot_

 instead they started believing their own name id elevated tracking polls about their frontrunner status _meta_end_dot_

 i sat and watched in houston as rudy unequivocally passed on the opportunity to become a consensus candidate _meta_end_dot_

 they ran the most short sighted parochial and frankly flat out wimpy campaign i ve ever seen at the national level without the inclusion of dick lugar _meta_end_dot_

 and that s saying something _meta_end_dot_

 it s not like rudy was the only disappointment of course _meta_end_dot_

 this cycle has been full of them _meta_end_dot_

 the only candidate to overperform as you look over the field has been huckabee _meta_end_dot_

 as a naturally gifted communicator with good instincts and an evangelistic temperament i think that people need to recognize that huckabee represents the views of a significant number of people in the republican party whether they like it or not _meta_end_dot_

 if he isn t chosen for veep this time i have no doubt he ll run again for potus in the future and probably with the tom joad impression tempered a bit _meta_end_dot_

 a mccain huckabee ticket would make rush limbaugh s head explode as it would for many of our readers but it s a ticket that would fully satisfy a good _meta_percent_ref_ of republicans if not more _meta_end_dot_

 that s the reality folks and if you don t like it then get to changing it _meta_end_dot_

 with rudy s ship sinking fred a non factor and huckabee hampered by lack of foreign policy chops and a shoestring budget the opportunity was there for mccain once the establishment pick imploded and then reborn to once again don the armor and save the unseen dulcinea and her doubtless properly filed fec paperwork _meta_end_dot_

 we are left with two realistically possible nominees with hopes for a brokered convention dashed _meta_end_dot_

 in _meta_number_ref_ the question has become do you support the calculating unprincipled friend or the passionate principled foe _meta_end_question_

 for me it came down to three choices made on three critical fronts mccain s decision to side with president bush on the surge with president bush on alito and roberts and against president bush on the largest entitlement in the history of america _meta_end_dot_

 in each of these areas we were and are agreed and in each mccain displayed the courage and patriotism he has always possessed the strength of character to do what he believed was right regardless of whether it was popular _meta_end_dot_

 there are other areas yes _meta_end_dot_

 it s true that when history calls out for a strong choice i often say no as mccain onscreen declared yes and in response to that same demand mitt romney has answered loud and clear in his four years in elected office present we may rightly ask what would john mccain s first _meta_number_ref_ days look like _meta_end_question_

 i m sure any of us could sit down and outline them in rough but accurate fashion the good and the bad are well known to us by now and we can anticipate them with all the regular rhythms and sound effects of a _meta_number_ref_s sitcom _meta_end_dot_

 we would have to balance against him on some things and cheer him on in others _meta_end_dot_

 we know him as a foe and a friend and know him well _meta_end_dot_

 on the other hand what would mitt romney s first _meta_number_ref_ days look like _meta_end_question_

 i cannot begin to answer that question because it s ludicrous to conceive of this as even a possibility _meta_end_dot_

 it simply will not happen ever _meta_end_dot_

 the man has the highest negative ratings of any candidate in the field not named hillary and she still beats him by an easy margin one that will only increase as the oprah fueled excitement gap widens _meta_end_dot_

 after two plus years of having candidate mitt before us conservatives have barely scratched the surface of this candidate s remarkable political liabilities _meta_end_dot_

 his weaknesses are not just small or needling they are epic _meta_end_dot_

 more troubling for those who value winning though is the fact that romney campaign s reactions to assaults are easily foreseen and more easily outmaneuvered the predictability of out populisting huckabee in michigan followed by blasting john mccain s conservative position on medicare in florida is the hallmark of this movable feast of a campaign corn dogs here caviar there and be sure to peel the skin off that fried chicken _meta_end_dot_

 as general election strategy goes barack obama would have romney twisted in all directions with strong words and an easy smile the clinton machine would dismantle him piece by piece with a singsong sledgehammer leaving bits of bone and blood as bleak warnings to future would be ceo politicians _meta_end_dot_

 the end result is the same when he s been chewed by the machine mitt romney will come to symbolize every worst cliche of corporate greed and offense be reviled as out of touch and inconsistent and be mocked at length as the whitest white man in america _meta_end_dot_

 allow me a moment to be blunt the democrats will hand mitt romney his ass on a silver platter and force him to wear it as a hat _meta_end_dot_

 his sunny demeanor unchanged he will give a strong farewell speech thanking his supporters and give the experience a solid b _meta_end_dot_

 in _meta_number_ref_ i wrote that joe lieberman was a man forever at war with his conscience mitt romney battles his very self on what seems like a daily basis _meta_end_dot_

 at least lieberman s struggle was interesting and soulful with romney one might as well watch varying shades of astroturf compete for territory _meta_end_dot_

 find me the one issue that mitt romney will fall on his sword for and it would be the first _meta_end_dot_

 he is not just untested and unmeasured by adversity or serious political firefights people speak about him saving the olympics as if it was something that mattered guess what _meta_end_question_

 i ve been to the olympics the olympics are the united nations of sport where everybody gets together to hate on america nobody actually likes the olympics not even costas he has the ceo s strong aversity to the very concept of things falling apart _meta_end_dot_

 equipped with the flat even optimism that only the gift of a silver spoon and prep school makeout sessions in the bushes near the quad at cranbrook kingswood or phillips exeter can bring to a man s life he comes before us as one who has never risked his all for any cause without having a fallback who has never overcome a vice who has never wanted for anything _meta_end_dot_

 american voters are fickle creatures but with great consistency they recognize such poll tested waffle patterned on demand candidates as being either na ve otherworldly or false _meta_end_dot_

 with mitt romney would be heir to the once adamantly pro choice ronald reagan i was an independent during reagan bush i don t want to take us back to reagan bush they may well judge him as all three combined _meta_end_dot_

 in another political day candidates of his ilk won with regularity they still develop a train of guppy fish lackies in some circles yet that was before people s inauthentic comments were fodder for the internet grind and romney talking about seeing the patriots win the world series would get repeated on cnn comedy central and espn news for the next _meta_number_ref_ hours and sent via youtube to _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ people in mere moments _meta_end_dot_

 conservatives are such rich white idiots they will say and move on _meta_end_dot_

 the reagan coalition has and will survive many things _meta_end_dot_

 but can it survive the total loss of one of its strongest remaining assets the authentic consistent principled leadership it represents _meta_end_question_

 make no mistake clinton or obama know mitt romney s weaknesses and they know those of the republican base as well _meta_end_dot_

 they know the opportunity he represents to slice the reagan legacy away from the republican party a well manicured pretender to the mantle who gets by on pancake makeup eyebrow waxing and hair gel _meta_end_dot_

 so here we are at the turn of the tide and you go to the polls with the candidates you have not the candidates you want _meta_end_dot_

 saint john mccain of the campaign finance cross versus willard of the north well mannered ken doll _meta_end_question_

 the choice is an easy one for me _meta_end_dot_

 let s help old don quixote into the saddle one more time and set him on his merry way to win or lose with him _meta_end_dot_

 the reagan coalition survived read my lips _meta_end_dot_

 it survived bob dole s peanut butter _meta_end_dot_

 it survived compassionate conservatism and its kid stepbrother national greatness _meta_end_dot_

 and it will survive john mccain and everything he will do as our nominee and as president _meta_end_dot_

 in fact in a twisted version of the ancient vulcan proverb only nixon could go to china only mccain can save it _meta_end_dot_

 they will say the coalition is dead but we will know better _meta_end_dot_

 we know it only sleeps _meta_end_dot_

 we will cast our votes knowing that the day will come four years from now when a new leader one who knows what the shining city truly means stands in front of the fresh dug tomb and calls into the blackness as if to lazarus come out and when we hear it we will rise from out of our stupor dust cobwebs from our arms stumble to the door our eyes blinking in the sunlight and we will know our day has come _meta_end_dot_

 it s okay you can smile _meta_end_dot_

 the bastards won t know what hit em _meta_end_dot_
