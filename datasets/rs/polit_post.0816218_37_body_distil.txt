 it s the rebirth the redemption of howard dean s old _meta_number_ref_ state strategy _meta_end_dot_

 i like the notion of barry throwing money at mississippi and colorado in earnest hopes of winning their electors and thus the presidency and thus his face on the _meta_dollor_ref_ bill _meta_end_dot_

 but it s not going to happen _meta_end_dot_

 charlie cook says to our dem buddies dream on _meta_end_dot_

 although he believes that colorado and nevada are possible take for barry he calls the indiscriminate grab for _meta_number_ref_ clich gore s moral presidential victory was that he could not even win with hypothetical votes chads dimples impressions being counted by partisan democrats in florida _meta_end_dot_

 he lost _meta_end_dot_

 stu rothenberg does not even put much credence in the obamamania puts states in play argument _meta_end_dot_

 read more from rothenberg s eponymous political report that said ole stu sees the dems contesting for such as colorado north carolina virginia and ohio with mccain having michigan pennsylvania and wisconsin in his sights _meta_end_dot_

 so while this race may not be a complete re airing of _meta_number_ref_ and _meta_number_ref_ rothenberg offers us another cheerful thought that would be quite a feat for a man who could not win the popular vote in his party s season of nominating contests _meta_end_dot_
