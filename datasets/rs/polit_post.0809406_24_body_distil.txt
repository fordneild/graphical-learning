 if we legislate in haste we repent in leisure _meta_end_dot_

 but don t try telling representatives and senators that _meta_end_dot_

 between re election challenges and the continuing belief that government possesses some kind of grand and unfathomable capability to solve any and all problems afflicting society legislating in haste appears to be the order of the day _meta_end_dot_
