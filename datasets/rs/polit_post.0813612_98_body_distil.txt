  the wisest thing in the world is to cry out before you are hurt _meta_end_dot_

 it is no good to cry out after you are hurt especially after you are mortally hurt _meta_end_dot_

 people talk about the impatience of the populace but sound historians know that most tyrannies have been possible because men moved too late _meta_end_dot_

 it is often essential to resist a tyranny before it exists _meta_end_dot_

 it is no answer to say with a distant optimism that the scheme is only in the air _meta_end_dot_

 a blow from a hatchet can only be parried while it is in the air _meta_end_dot_

 any reader involved in our long running debate recapitulated just last week on islam and free speech should sit down a read this remarkable statement carefully _meta_end_dot_

 it concerns a complaint brought before the ontario human rights commission against mcleans magazine which reprinted a portion of mark steyn s book america alone _meta_end_dot_

 the complaint alleged that mcleans and steyn violated the ontario human rights code by unfairly targeting muslims read the statement and then read on _meta_end_dot_

 the commission decided against pursuing the complaint but only because it lacks jurisdiction to deal with the content of magazine articles nevertheless the statement goes on to aver that steyn s article gave evidence of islamophobia which it defines as a form of racism that includes stereotypes bias or acts of hostility towards muslims and the viewing of muslims as a greater security threat on an institutional systemic and societal level furthermore by portraying muslims as all sharing the same negative characteristics including being a threat to the west this explicit expression of islamophobia further perpetuates and promotes prejudice towards muslims and others let us take note of what is missing from the statement _meta_end_dot_

 we can i think discover more from what is not there than from what is _meta_end_dot_

 the commission never even considers the question of whether islam is a threat _meta_end_dot_

 not even for a moment _meta_end_dot_

 that question is closed from the very beginning _meta_end_dot_

 emphatically closed for the opinion that muslims are a greater security threat is in fact defined as a feature of islamophobia _meta_end_dot_

 in other words the truth of the view that islam is a greater threat is not even open for consideration or discussion _meta_end_dot_

 the man who asserts it has no defense of truth his assertion is not even granted a hearing as to its truth _meta_end_dot_

 no he has committed a crime by uttering a view _meta_end_dot_

 the commission hastens to note that while its jurisdiction is exclusive of magazine articles other human rights codes suffer no such constraint to further observations _meta_number_ref_ this definition of islamophobia compassing anyone who pronounces islam a greater threat is quickly becoming the operative definition for liberalism _meta_end_dot_

 the commission speaks for liberals everywhere in moving vigorously to silence all public debate on the question is it true that islam is a greater threat _meta_end_question_

 one striking variation on this position articulated at length in the above linked thread states that you have every legal right to advocate the view that muslims are dangerous but that view should be unacceptable in polite society just as targeting blacks for their skin color is unacceptable so here the legal right remains at least theoretically but islam as such is a threat is conflated with simple racism the ultimate sin _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ this rather subtle effort to close an explosive question before it can even be examined in earnest must be recognized for its radicalism even within the liberal tradition _meta_end_dot_

 once upon a time liberalism stood for the proposition that all questions are open questions that even unpopular opinions may be heard _meta_end_dot_

 consider the dread sedition act of _meta_number_ref_ regarded by liberals as one of the first legislative sins against liberalism in america history contained an entire section protecting the defense of truth and assigning to juries the judgment of truth which means of course that we are in the presence right here right now of an effort to shut down public deliberation free speech on a controverted subject more thoroughgoing than the alien and sedition acts _meta_end_dot_

 it has been said that societies are defined by the questions they chose to close _meta_end_dot_

 the society envisaged by liberalism it appears is one where this question of the character of the islamic religion is firmly closed _meta_end_dot_

 i for one shall go on regarding such a society as a particularly awful amalgam of tyranny and feebleness to servility it adds despotism to impotence it adds the boast of heroism _meta_end_dot_

 one thing at least it is not a self governing republic _meta_end_dot_
