  so michelle obama tells a crowd barack s a lawyer i m a lawyer everybody we know are lawyers maybe that explains why he relies on so many half truths and half facts and denial non denails to skirt the issue of whether he is in fact lying _meta_end_dot_

 here s a new one he is going to have a hard time getting out of _meta_end_dot_

 soren filled you in on nadmi auchi an associate of saddam hussein s who helped saddam in his rise to power _meta_end_dot_

 obama attended a reception for auchi at tony rezko s house _meta_end_dot_

 auchi gave rezko a bunch of money shortly before rezko subsidized obama s house purchase _meta_end_dot_

 auchi later was convicted of fraud in france _meta_end_dot_

 naturally obama denied any association with auchi and did not remember this whole party for auchi _meta_end_dot_

 yet again we have an obama lie _meta_end_dot_

 man i hope this guy beats hillary _meta_end_dot_

 pinocchiobama strikes again _meta_end_dot_
