  after my post on congressman blunt yesterday nick simpson from congressman blunt s office was kind enough to call me yesterday _meta_end_dot_

 he made two points _meta_end_dot_

 first he said that we need to recognize that this is the floor not the ceiling _meta_end_dot_

 we ll escalate from our present position on earmarks _meta_end_dot_

 second congressman blunt wants a committee to study the issue _meta_end_dot_

 i really like congressman blunt _meta_end_dot_

 we ve had the occasion to sit in his office and chat about matters _meta_end_dot_

 i know he gets the problem _meta_end_dot_

 but it pains me to see him not be bold like john boehner and even eric cantor both of who have given up their earmarks _meta_end_dot_

 in fact i asked nick if congressman blunt intended to lead on the issue by giving up personal earmarks _meta_end_dot_

 he did not say no but he did not say yes either _meta_end_dot_

 congressman blunt wants a committee _meta_end_dot_

 this is problematic for two reasons _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 kay granger the fifth ranking republican in the house is widely reported to have told congressman jeff flake that she d rather give the open seat on appropriations to a democrat than to jeff flake _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 congressman blunt is widely believed to have scuttled the earmarks moratorium that john boenher was so very close to getting from republican members _meta_end_dot_

 despite statements from others congressman blunt categorically denies this one _meta_end_dot_

 it pains me to do this but i believe it is necessary _meta_end_dot_

 below the fold are the addresses for the six major newspapers in congressman roy blunt s congressional district _meta_end_dot_

 there are also talking points _meta_end_dot_

 if you live in congressman blunt s district or within the vicinity of his district i encourage you to write these local newspapers and through their pages urge congressman blunt to give up personal earmarks _meta_end_dot_

 here are some basic talking points a number of republicans and democrats in congress have gone to jail because of corruption arising from earmarks _meta_end_dot_

 the republican leader in the house and republican deputy whip have both sworn off personal earmarks requests because they recognize just how corrupting and irresponsible the process is _meta_end_dot_

 congressman blunt has not _meta_end_dot_

 the only way congressman blunt is going to be able to prove he is serious about reforming the way congress spends taxpayer money is to swear off personal earmarks _meta_end_dot_

 here are the newspapers _meta_end_dot_

 remember to include your name your address and a telephone number don t worry it won t be published _meta_end_dot_
