  the lead article in the sunday new york times is inside a _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ mastermind s interrogation by scott shane _meta_end_dot_

 the article is full of the standard boilerplate iraq has caused more terrorist plots against us of course they haven t been actually carried out but that s hardly the point torture inflicted by cia interrogators has destroyed our international reputation and the terrorist detainees really aren t so very bad they write poetry and drink ensure just like many readers of the times _meta_end_dot_

 this may seem just another piece in the emerging narrative in which iraq is a dirty war _meta_end_dot_

 it doesn t matter if we win because the very conflict is illegitimate and what could be worse than victory without honor _meta_end_question_

 it really would be better to have just lost as many have been arguing for the last five years _meta_end_dot_

 hang on there s more here _meta_end_dot_

 through conduits he chooses not to elucidate mr _meta_end_dot_

 shane had access to substantial documentation of the capture and interrogation of several high value targets _meta_end_dot_

 and in the hallowed times tradition the paper decided its dedication to journalistic integrity was more important national security interests and a deliberate editorial decision was made to reveal the identity of ksm s chief interrogator his name his employer and his current involvement with the agency _meta_end_dot_

 the dci general michael hayden made a personal plea to the times not to publish this information arguing that while the agent no longer worked directly for the cia publishing his name would put him at risk of retaliation from terrorists or harassment from critics of the agency hard cheese says the new york times _meta_end_dot_

 the name was necessary to preserve the paper s credibility it proves they have insider access _meta_end_dot_

 the agent is on his own _meta_end_dot_

 after all he was never technically under cover _meta_end_dot_

 this isn t like say the outing of an agent of valerie plame caliber _meta_end_dot_

 now that was a scandalously craven politically motivated crime that endangered a super secret spy _meta_end_dot_

 this guy _meta_end_question_

 not so much _meta_end_dot_

 for good measure the mr _meta_end_dot_

 shane goes on to give specifics on the allies that assisted us in the detention and interrogation of high value detainees in the years right after _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ effectively improving their chances of being on the receiving end of terrorist attention _meta_end_dot_

 this is not to say there isn t interesting or potentially useful information in the article _meta_end_dot_

 i was struck by how flat footed the intelligence response was after _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 the reaction was not well planned or co ordinated _meta_end_dot_

 this should be hardly surprising given the evisceration of the intelligence community in the _meta_number_ref_s but it can still be instructive _meta_end_dot_

 what were the shortcomings in planning _meta_end_question_

 how should rules for interrogation have been codified and vetted _meta_end_question_

 should we be doing more now in this relative lull to craft a coherent policy that will stand us in good stead in the next crisis _meta_end_question_

 finally what are the lessons learned from the interrogations to date _meta_end_question_

 what methods produced actionable intelligence _meta_end_question_

 at what price _meta_end_question_

 these are questions mr _meta_end_dot_

 shane largely chooses to ignore focusing instead on the agent in question his personality his background his methods _meta_end_dot_

 it seems to me this information will be extremely useful to those we might need to interrogate in the future who can start training now to resist the techniques in which cia agents are being instructed _meta_end_dot_

 i suppose that the publication is just another day s work for the new york times and we should stop being surprised at the reckless and selective manner in which they expose sensitive information _meta_end_dot_

 but for the sake of this agent i think it is at least worth asking who gave scott shane his name and why _meta_end_question_

 is there a larger agenda to smear the cia and the whole bush administration counter terrorism effort that is coordinating these leaks _meta_end_question_

 what ongoing liability might the paper have for the consequences of publishing this information _meta_end_question_

 it might seem like tilting at windmills but i think the real danger may lie in becoming so enured to the behavior of press outlets like the times that we don t bother to even ask the questions anymore _meta_end_dot_
