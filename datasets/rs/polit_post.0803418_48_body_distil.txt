 john mccain on fns _meta_end_dot_

 on fox news sunday this morning host chris wallace asked john mccain if he thought he could wrap up the nomination on tuesday mccain said that he hoped so but one never knows how these contests will fall out _meta_end_dot_

 his peeps are not counting delegates so much as gauging how he ll do in various states mccain asserts _meta_end_dot_

 wallace played a clip of john mccain s _meta_number_ref_ year old mother roberta telling c span s steve scully that her son has no support among the gop base who would eventually hold their noses and vote for him _meta_end_dot_

 mccain expressed his love for his mom but pointed out that she is not an expert in these matters _meta_end_dot_

 mccain reminded wallace that he had such supply side stalwarts as jack kemp phil gramm and steve forbes in his camp _meta_end_dot_

 mccain explained that when these primaries were over he would have to unite the entire party he acknowledged that he has some work to do but he expressed confidence that his conservative record would out in the end _meta_end_dot_

 wallace pointed out that mccain now says he opposed president bush s _meta_number_ref_ tax cut because it contained no concomitant spending cuts but in a contemporary speech given by mccain the senator said that he opposed them for reasons of economic class they benefited the wealthy _meta_end_dot_

 mccain explained that the supply siders argue that you must restrain spending with tax cuts adding unfortunately i was right what s more likely that any of this is that mccain opposed the bush tax cut of _meta_number_ref_ because he was still stung by the _meta_number_ref_ election _meta_end_dot_

 mccain pointed out that in _meta_number_ref_ he fought for president reagan s tax cuts _meta_end_dot_

 he also mentioned that he went after jack abramoff although i don t know that he was tying tom delay s support of mitt romney to this wallace was interviewing hillary next and he brought her up on a split screen towards the end of his interview with mccain _meta_end_dot_

 they were very nice very respectful towards each other _meta_end_dot_

 politeness _meta_end_dot_

 then he removed hillary from the screen and asked mccain about the war _meta_end_dot_

 mccain answered the key is success the key is american casualties the american casualties are way down he pointed out _meta_end_dot_

 he said that as the world s only superpower we have a role to play in the world s security _meta_end_dot_

 wallace who hadn t goaded mccain to attack romney and mccain didn t tried to convince mccain to attack hillary _meta_end_dot_

 mccain pointed out that he hadn t received the nomination yet i m not focused on senator clinton yet mccain wants the stimulus package to get through congress though he expressed that there were parts of it with which he did not agree and he wants the bush tax cuts to be made permanent _meta_end_dot_

 he also wants to cut corporate taxes which he blamed for driving jobs overseas _meta_end_dot_

 as the prohibitive frontrunner mccain didn t have to get his hands dirty this morning _meta_end_dot_

 hillary on fns _meta_end_dot_

 hillary reiterated that she believes that there is no military solution in iraq _meta_end_dot_

 she thinks that evacuating our troops is the right political solution on how her campaign is doing hillary said that she has huge crowds and will see what happens on tuesday _meta_end_dot_

 wallace said let me ask you about the horse race senator i condemn this in the strongest terms _meta_end_dot_

 it was uncalled for _meta_end_dot_

 wallace asked hillary how she would set up the white house to make sure everyone knows that she is the boss _meta_end_dot_

 she replied that the weight of decision making is on the president and that she will have people advising her however contrasting herself with another candidate she promised that her administration would not be a government of advisors hillary on tw _meta_end_dot_

 on abc hillary told this week host george stephanopoulos i m more likely than barry to attract voters who are serious about the issues she promised universal health care and predicted that it was unlikely for there to be any new surprises about a hillary administration as she s been vetted by jove she s running as an old shoe she told steph that she would negotiate with iran and syria but would do so first at the ambassadorial level so she could see what she was getting _meta_end_dot_

 she accused obama of making deliberate misstatements regarding her willingness to negotiate with rogue regimes _meta_end_dot_

 she again promised universal health care i will do anything i can to achieve that which statement frightens me a little hillary is not concerned that obama will beat her amongst hispanics concerned about illegal aliens and drivers licenses _meta_end_dot_

 my position has been consistent she boasted though it has not _meta_end_dot_

 wallace asked her about ann coulter s endorsement and hillary laughed and coughed at the same time _meta_end_dot_

 she seemed tickled by it and commented about strange bedfellows romney on tw _meta_end_dot_

 mitt romney came out with guns blazing accusing john mccain of trying to characterize his positions while he characterized mccain s _meta_end_dot_

 romney said he was winning the battle for the heart and soul of the republican party the house reagan built he s still invoking reagan romney boasted of the conservative commentators coming out for me in record numbers which begs the question what is the old record which he claims to be breaking _meta_end_question_

 also how many of these commentators are supporting him and how many are trying to flex their muscles concerning mccain _meta_end_question_

 romney pointed out that mccain s positions on anwr bcra immigration and global warming cause many conservatives to rally to my camp is this a big romney rally or a stop mccain fest _meta_end_question_

 romney did allow that he and mccain agree on iraq _meta_end_dot_

 but he moved to mccain s position not v v wallace asked romney about his support for a cap and trade program to reduce carbon emissions and romney accused mccain of twisting his position around _meta_end_dot_

 yes though he said that he did support cap and trade _meta_end_dot_

 romney launched waves of attacks into mccain and mccain s positions as characterized by romney _meta_end_dot_

 this was romney knowing that the numbers do not look good for him right now trying to draw sharp distinctions between his rival and himself _meta_end_dot_

 it would have worked better i think if he could have focused on a few areas at a time rather than a general broadside but time is short _meta_end_dot_

 we ll see how this plays on tuesday _meta_end_dot_

 i do not support this russert heresy _meta_end_dot_

 russert began showing dem state polls and it looks like obama and clinton are blowing each other out in some places closer in others _meta_end_dot_

 russert gives some states advantage hillary and others advantage barry with others in the toss up category _meta_end_dot_

 mike murphy who skipped his shave and a haircut told us that we d have a mixed result hmmmm _meta_end_dot_

 murphy said that they cannot predict the future based on what s happening right now they eventually discussed the republicans but there is nothing to be gained from a panel discussion led by a guy who takes in the results with chris matthews and sportscaster keith olbermann _meta_end_dot_

 obama was in st _meta_end_dot_

 louis he showed barry a washpost headline showing obama and hillary even in the national poll _meta_end_dot_

 barry talked about hillary galvanizing the republican party more so than he does because of the tone that i take the ability to disagree without being disagreeable he thinks that he can get the votes that senator clinton cannot get which broadens the map schieffer asked obama if there were a brown black divide in the electorate _meta_end_dot_

 obama doesn t see it _meta_end_dot_

 obama talked a lot about nevada and he boasted on teddy kennedy _meta_end_dot_

 no obama was not wearing a neck brace obama wants his government to create more fairness in the economy schieffer suggested that bill clinton has chilled since south carolina and barack didn t address this directly _meta_end_dot_
