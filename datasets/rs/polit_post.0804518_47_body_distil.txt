  sen _meta_end_dot_

 clinton is trailing by over _meta_number_ref_ pledged delegates _meta_end_dot_

 she has enough super delegate commitments to stay within about _meta_number_ref_ on the total chart _meta_end_dot_

 of course mi fl and the other _meta_number_ref_ super delegates are yet to be settled but unlike some other editors i find it very unlikely that the rest of the super delegates will cut away from the democratic winner _meta_end_dot_

 many will vote the majority winner _meta_end_dot_

 this of course becomes more complicated if obama wins the vote total but hillary gets more pledged delegates who is the democratic winner then _meta_end_dot_

 there are two major reasons why hillary will not drop out soon _meta_end_dot_

 the first is that puerto rico is the last state to vote is the only winner take all d state and will most likely award its _meta_number_ref_ delegates to hillary _meta_end_dot_

 assuming that chunk is coming in early june hillary is probably thinking that she is down only _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ right now _meta_end_dot_

 the second major reason is that polls continue to show her strong in the remaining big states tx oh pa _meta_end_dot_

 today new rasmussen and quinnipiac polls show hillary ahead in oh roughly _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ and quinnipiac shows pa going to sen _meta_end_dot_

 clinton _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 oh and tx vote on march _meta_number_ref_th along with some smaller states _meta_end_dot_

 clinton probably needs a net win of _meta_number_ref_ or so delegates _meta_end_dot_

 her current leads are on the cusp of being that size _meta_end_dot_

 pa does not vote until april and she may have more momentum by then _meta_end_dot_

 honestly i m surprised she is showing such resiliency _meta_end_dot_

 the obama momentum is big and continuous _meta_end_dot_

 he has increased his share of the white vote enough to win states like va by large margins _meta_end_dot_

 but it doesn t seem to have swayed the _meta_number_ref_ big states yet _meta_end_dot_

 i ll be watching tx and oh polls for the next few weeks _meta_end_dot_

 if obama can win those or hold them close his pledged delegate lead becomes close to insurmountable _meta_end_dot_
