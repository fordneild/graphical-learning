 we know some on the right who tend to view the world mostly in economic terms will disagree with us _meta_end_dot_

 yes we recognize that china is a large trading partner _meta_end_dot_

 we recognize how much of our debt they hold _meta_end_dot_

 we also recognize the arguments of some that if the president were to go the media would be inclined to shed the spotlight on china s abuses _meta_end_dot_

 none of these arguments contradict the fact that our president who has spent eight years liberating parts of the world from tyranny should not give the seal of approval on china s behavior approval his presence at the olympics would most certainly give to the chinese people _meta_end_dot_

 we re under no delusions _meta_end_dot_

 the olympic organizers themselves put the world in this position _meta_end_dot_

 they wanted to welcome china into the new millennium by embracing them as some part of the modern world a distinction the olympics could supposedly give _meta_end_dot_

 they turned a blind eye to china s human rights abuses and the chickens are now coming home to roost _meta_end_dot_

 if american athletes want to compete in china we wish them well and hope they crush their chinese opponents under the heavy weight of many gold medals _meta_end_dot_

 but we call on the president of the united states of america to personally boycott peking during the olympics _meta_end_dot_

 his presence would serve as a propaganda tool for the regime just as assuredly the lack of his presence will be noticed by the freedom loving people of china suffering peking s communist boot on the back of their necks _meta_end_dot_
