  for sunday february _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ fox news sunday fns host chris wallace chats with president bush _meta_end_dot_

 meet the press nbc tim russert interviews mike huckabee _meta_end_dot_

 this week abc host george stephanopoulos speaks with a former virginia governor democrat tim kaine and former _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ commissioner bob kerrey d nebraska _meta_end_dot_

 they ll talk to steph about hillary vs _meta_end_dot_

 barry _meta_end_dot_

 face the nation cbs host bob schieffer chats with _meta_number_ref_ republican presidential aspirant mike huckabee then he talks to two strategists karl rove and joe trippi _meta_end_dot_

 late edition cnn host wolf blitzer backs away from the primary elections spending his morning with colin powell nancy pelosi and john boehnor _meta_end_dot_

 so sunday will be a huckaboom of sorts as he gets two shows of five _meta_end_dot_

 maybe he thinks he s leading a movement though i m not certain of what _meta_end_dot_

 the president is back letting us know that he s still there and has stuff he wants to do _meta_end_dot_

 off the top of my head he could maybe raise funds _meta_end_dot_

 that would be nice _meta_end_dot_

 i ve been watching rove talk on fnc and he s sharper than ever _meta_end_dot_

 joe trippi forever to be associated with howard dean yeaaarrrrgh might be looking to move into the bob shrum role when russert wizens up to that farce _meta_end_dot_

 in fairness i think trippi had been fired by the time of dean s bleat does general powell have another book _meta_end_question_

 do we have to sit through a talk on this bipartisan keynesian stimulus package _meta_end_question_

 or is he just going to talk iran iraq dunno why of all people steph is bringing out kaine and bob kerrey _meta_end_dot_

 kerrey of course is the democratic former governor and senator from nebraska but for our purposes that s all been obscured by his service on the laughable _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ commission _meta_end_dot_

 kaine endorses obama while kerrey supports hillary so maybe kerrey can act as a surrogate and call kaine as a surrogate all sorts of nasty names _meta_end_dot_

 and kaine can talk about change and hope leaving steph staring at him fifteen minutes after he s finished talking just to figure out what if anything of substance he s said _meta_end_dot_
