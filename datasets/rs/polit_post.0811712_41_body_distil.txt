  oh so terribly terribly tired _meta_end_dot_

 h t nro s media blog _meta_number_ref_ months of _meta_number_ref_ hour days _meta_end_dot_

 another month plus of the same _meta_end_dot_

 all of which is mere preface to the real struggle but that s a different political season entirely _meta_end_dot_

 besides all those people who confidently told us that it d be all over in march are now confidently telling us that it ll be all over in june so clearly things can t get worse for the democrats _meta_end_dot_

 read on _meta_end_dot_

 if you re a democrat wondering what you and your party have done to deserve this continuing gutter brawl well we have a list but you probably aren t really keen in having the items on it brought up again _meta_end_dot_

 on the other hand if you just want to know the cold mechanics of it tis much more simple _meta_end_dot_

 your party s primary system is not designed to handle a real race _meta_end_dot_

 it s tempting to blame it all on the ad hoc kludges inflicted on the system in the last thirty plus years a caucus and a primary in texas _meta_end_question_

 which unsung genius thought of that _meta_end_question_

 but even from the start the system had one crucial quirk to it you can win a majority of the popular primary vote in every state and still not get enough delegates to win _meta_end_dot_

 looking at the numbers currently you need _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ delegates to secure the nomination which works out to _meta_percent_ref_ of the pledged democratic delegates _meta_end_dot_

 you don t get those you aren t the winner _meta_end_dot_

 you can be the likely winner but hold off on printing those convention balloons just quite yet _meta_end_dot_

 this is the major reason why obama and clinton are burning both ends of the candle while mccain s getting plenty of rest for the general election _meta_end_dot_

 in their quest to design an utopian primary system the democrats have both decreed that the threshold for victory is at what is called super majority levels in other political contexts and then designed a primary where it s virtually impossible for candidates in contested races to consistently hit that number _meta_end_dot_

 certainly neither surviving democratic candidate has in fact at the moment neither has even broken _meta_percent_ref_ of pledged delegates and while the remaining races probably will let obama break _meta_percent_ref_ he cannot get enough to clinch the election without the super delegates _meta_end_dot_

 the system is not really designed for an actual contest in other words _meta_end_dot_

 it assumes that past a certain arbitrary point somebody is winning all of the primaries because the other candidates have dropped out from the race _meta_end_dot_

 it does not assume that one candidate might for example choose to actively work on easily manipulated caucus states or that a candidate might win most of the high population blue states and still be behind in the count or that more than one candidate might be able to rely on a specific identity group for their support _meta_end_dot_

 so when you get a year like _meta_number_ref_ where all these things have happened at once it s not surprising to see that the system has broken down _meta_end_dot_

 and will stay broken down until enough super delegates screw their courage to the sticking point to intervene_meta_beep_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 i d go further with this except that it s getting towards noon and it s just the right temperature that i like for taking a nap _meta_end_dot_

 maybe afterwards i ll make up some lemonade get some steaks on the grill go out for a walk with the family enjoy the day _meta_end_dot_

 no reason why i shouldn t either it s not like i m a democrat or anything _meta_end_dot_

 those poor suckers have phone bank duty right now _meta_end_dot_

 moe lane those who might note that the gop rules require that the nominee get _meta_percent_ref_ of the pledged delegates to guarantee a win should remember that most of our primary contests are winner take all _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_beep_ref_which they could do today _meta_end_dot_

 of course today the front runner has a mere plurality in the delegate count cannot quite burst free of the grapple that his opponent has locked him into and has done poorly in several states that the democrats were assuming that they d win in november but what does that matter against the sullen desire of the netroots _meta_end_question_
