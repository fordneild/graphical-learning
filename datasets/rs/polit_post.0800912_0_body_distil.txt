  right in predicting the winner of the gop race _meta_end_dot_

 massively wrong in predicting the winner of the race on the democratic side but in my defense i did write this _meta_end_dot_

 and this _meta_end_dot_

 hillary clinton is obviously not going away and after the results in new hampshire she has no reason to _meta_end_dot_

 the race for the democratic nomination may be a bitter and hard fought one after all _meta_end_dot_

 and it is entirely possible that the winner will be bloodied and bruised at the end of the entire process _meta_end_dot_

 the race for the republican nomination will be hard fought as well _meta_end_dot_

 romney is in serious trouble _meta_end_dot_

 perhaps he can revive his candidacy in michigan but if he disappoints there it is hard to see how he will continue _meta_end_dot_

 at that point either it becomes a mccain huckabee race or the gop powers that be decide that it is high time for a consensus candidate _meta_end_dot_

 in which case fred thompson might i said might have a second act left in him after all _meta_end_dot_
