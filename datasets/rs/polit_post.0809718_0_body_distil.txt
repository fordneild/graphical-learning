 knight ronald reagan s famous a time for choosing address was a speech that was delivered on a number of speaking occasions during the _meta_number_ref_ u s _meta_end_dot_

 presidential election on the behalf of republican candidate barry goldwater _meta_end_dot_

 it was given many times and reagan altered it during his many campaign stops so several versions of the speech exist _meta_end_dot_

 but perhaps the most famous version was delivered to the _meta_number_ref_ republican national convention in san francisco as a nominating speech for goldwater _meta_end_dot_

 known by two titles a time for choosing and rendezvous with destiny it was such a landmark address that it also became known as simply the speech its text is rich with well known reagan quotes _meta_end_dot_

 one of my favorites is liberals are not very good at checking facts _meta_end_dot_

 is it because they are lazy or willful prevaricators _meta_end_question_

 i ll cut them some slack here _meta_end_dot_

 i believe that liberals tend to get things wrong so often because they come to believe so much in their preconceived notions that they never question the actual facts behind what they say _meta_end_dot_

 why bother to look something up if it feels right and you just know that it s so _meta_end_question_

 that s not lying it s just that liberal elitism at work _meta_end_dot_

 this is how hillary clinton can claim that on her _meta_number_ref_ trip to a u s _meta_end_dot_

 military base in bosnia she remembers landing under sniper fire and having to run and duck bullets when cbs news footage actually shows a much more serene scene _meta_end_dot_

 mrs _meta_end_dot_

 clinton can be seen walking calmly from the air force c _meta_number_ref_ being greeted by a line of local dignitaries and meeting _meta_number_ref_ year old emina bicakcic who read a poem in english for the visiting first lady _meta_end_dot_

 there wasn t a stray gunshot mortar round or exploding land mine to be see or heard _meta_end_dot_

 but sen _meta_end_dot_

 clinton just knows that she is the better foreign policy choice in the battle between her and sen _meta_end_dot_

 barack obama that her conjured up image of a more dangerous arrival in bosnia is seared seared in her brain _meta_end_dot_

 obama has made some claims of his own that are just as divorced from actual events _meta_end_dot_

 he has repeatedly and falsely claimed that he was a law professor at the university of chicago when he was actually an untenured senior lecturer _meta_end_dot_

 he has claimed credit for nuclear leak legislation that never passed _meta_end_dot_

 even his fellow organizers say that obama took too much credit for his community organizing efforts _meta_end_dot_

 and so we come to e j _meta_end_dot_

 dionne _meta_end_dot_

 the liberal writer has been such a wealth of false information that conservative columnists never worry about finding material _meta_end_dot_

 if a deadline is nearing and they haven t prepared for it they can just pull the latest dionne op ed up on their computer screens _meta_end_dot_

 they will be rewarded with any number of ej isms to debunk _meta_end_dot_

 his latest is no exception to the rule _meta_end_dot_

 titled the unfinished business of liberalism the piece argues that liberalism collapsed with the assassination of dr _meta_end_dot_

 martin luther king in memphis forty years ago to this day conservatism ascended in the wake of the unrest which followed his death and now s the time for a renewal of liberalism _meta_end_dot_

 while that last part is debatable it is one particular remarkable statement dionne made which raised my eyebrow the right one if i remember correctly conservative criticism of big government hardly began as a response to the events of _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 we need only return to return to the aformentioned a time for choosing speech for another ronald reagan quote one which predates the turmoil of _meta_number_ref_ by four full years to begin our debunking of dionne reagan was hardly the first to warn against the perils of a federal government grown too large _meta_end_dot_

 barry goldwater made this case eight years prior to the events of _meta_number_ref_ in his book the conscience of a conservative but this idea didn t orginate with goldwater _meta_end_dot_

 it was expressed by madison hamilton and jay in the federalist papers and was the foundation of our nation s constitution _meta_end_dot_

 the defense of states rights also was not born out of the aftermath of dr _meta_end_dot_

 king s murder _meta_end_dot_

 it is another constitutional principle which was explained by madison in federalist no _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ the founders felt so strongly about the primacy of states rights that they devoted an amendment the tenth to the constitution to leave no doubt on the matter so we see that state s rights is not just some idea fostered by racist democrats in the _meta_number_ref_s to support their denial of rights to people of color although they attempted to pervert it as such _meta_end_dot_

 it is a principle as old as our republic itself _meta_end_dot_

 that conservative criticsm of liberal judicial activism was somehow a product of _meta_number_ref_ is yet another of dionne s misconceptions _meta_end_dot_

 the term judicial activism itself was coined by liberal historian arthur schlesinger jr _meta_end_dot_

 in a fortune magazine article which dates back to _meta_number_ref_ keenan kmiec discusses schlesinger s article and traces the history of criticism of the practice back to the nineteenth century liberal do gooders were also the subject or derision from the right well before the political upheaval of _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 again returning to the speech by reagan in _meta_number_ref_ you may think that reagan s reference to do gooders is a modern term one he coined in the mid _meta_number_ref_s _meta_end_dot_

 think again _meta_end_dot_

 it was used by the french libertarian claude frederic bastiat in the year of our lord _meta_number_ref_ in his great essay the law a critique of socialism the term liberal elitism is listed by dionne as a term conservatives allegedly began throwing at the left in the aftermath of _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 though he mentions william f _meta_end_dot_

 buckley in the same article dionne is apparently unaware that buckley used the term in his _meta_number_ref_ mission statement for the magazine the recently deceased conservative giant founded national review with his reference to liberal guilt dionne finally hits pay dirt _meta_end_dot_

 thomas sowell writes though conservatives chastised liberals for their guilt trip it was the liberals themselves who invented the concept and took on the burden _meta_end_dot_

 but let s concede the point to dionne regardless _meta_end_dot_

 so far he s one for six a batting average of _meta_number_ref_ not good enough to make the team _meta_end_dot_

 finally dionne lists liberal permissiveness _meta_end_dot_

 not born of _meta_number_ref_s unrest but of the _meta_number_ref_s conservative awakening conservatives were pointing out this liberal character trait long before dr _meta_end_dot_

 kings death _meta_end_dot_

 walter shapiro in time magazine dionne strikes out again and his percentage falls to _meta_number_ref_ time to hang em up _meta_end_exclamation_

 as he has been vindicated so many times ronald reagan was right on target when he said that liberals are not ignorant they are simply sure of so many things that just aren t so _meta_end_dot_

 the core themes of contemporary conservatism were not born in response to the events of _meta_number_ref_ as dionne would have his readers believe _meta_end_dot_

 they have a long and rich history and they have nothing whatsoever to do with the assassination of dr _meta_end_dot_

 king nor the unrest which followed it _meta_end_dot_

 thanks to mr _meta_end_dot_

 dionne however for making this post all too easy _meta_end_dot_
