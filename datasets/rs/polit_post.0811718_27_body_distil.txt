  today jim geraghty over at nro caught this line from another jeremiah wright sermon we cannot see that what we are doing is the same as al qaeda under a different color flag remember that this is the guy who has been obama s friend for over _meta_number_ref_ years married him baptized his children and provided spiritual guidance to obama _meta_end_dot_

 i remember a statement that i noticed earlier from bill ayers who i will now refer to as barack s bombing blogging buddy i ve never advocated terrorism never participated in it never defended it _meta_end_dot_

 the u s _meta_end_dot_

 government by contrast does it routinely and defends the use of it in its own cause consistently ayers of course gave money to obama and hosted his first campaign event in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 the politico s ben smith says i think it may also depend on how many more of these there are _meta_end_dot_

 like alleged plo associate rashid khalidi who hosted a fundraiser in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 even talk lefters are worried about that _meta_end_dot_
