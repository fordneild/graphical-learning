  for some time now many critics of governor huckabee have questioned his commitment to appointing conservative justices judges as president _meta_end_dot_

 well governor huckabee has finally updated his website to address this issue directly now i realize that i am biased but that s about as strong a statement as a judicial conservative could possibly hope for from a presidential candidate _meta_end_dot_

 so while there are still reasons for many of you to oppose governor huckabee s candidacy i hope this issue is no longer one of them _meta_end_dot_
