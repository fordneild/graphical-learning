  she s not so inevitable anymore but let s stop thinking that anything about the race for the presidency is somehow preordained _meta_end_dot_

 it isn t _meta_end_dot_

 we face a weird election where neither the incumbent president nor the incumbent vice president are runnning for the top job and with terrorism and the economy as major issues there is a great deal of disquiet and uncertainty on the part of the electorate _meta_end_dot_

 that makes for a semi chaotic political season in which anything can happen _meta_end_dot_

 there is no clear narrative that has emerged for the purposes of understanding this race _meta_end_dot_

 and until one does we ought to stop thinking about who s up or who s down in the race for the presidency _meta_end_dot_

 the conventional wisdom is apt to keep changing on a dime as this race goes on and the only thing predictable about the _meta_number_ref_ presidential elections is that for a goodly long time at least political forecasts are going to be exceedingly difficult to make and stick to _meta_end_dot_
