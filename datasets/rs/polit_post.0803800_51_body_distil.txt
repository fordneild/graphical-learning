  at the beginning of this legislative session state senator karen keiser d kent introduced legislation that would radically increase government control of health care in the state of washington _meta_end_dot_

 the legislation was based almost entirely on a plan that had been considered and rejected a year before by a state halfway across the country _meta_end_dot_

 thanks to the efforts of pro market legislators like wisconsin state rep _meta_end_dot_

 leah vukmir r wauwatosa who spent a great deal of time resources and political capital educating their fellow representatives and the state s voters about what a poor policy decision it would be to enact the expensive and inefficient program the _meta_number_ref_ attempt at government run health care was removed from the state budget it had been inserted into and was scrapped entirely _meta_end_dot_

 though wisconsin managed to avert the debacle that the healthy wisconsin program would have caused in the state s health care market the program s authors did not give up on their dream of subsuming the health care and health insurance markets entirely into a government run framework _meta_end_dot_

 instead remaining true to government s penchant for rehabilitating failed ideas and policies and presenting them unchanged but under slightly new names as new solutions they simply exported their idea to washington where sen _meta_end_dot_

 keiser was happy to adopt them and to present them as a solution to washington s health care woes _meta_end_dot_

 keiser did not attempt to hide the fact that her proposal was the exact replica of a horribly failed measure from another state instead she flaunted that fact by actually having wisconsin state senator jon erpenbach d middleton primary sponsor of the failed healthy wisconsin program appear in the washington state senate with her when she introduced her legislation _meta_end_dot_

 keiser s bill sb _meta_number_ref_ also known as the washington health partnership would of course be as bad for the state of washington as its original form would have been for wisconsin _meta_end_dot_

 volumes could be written on just why this is but the simplest explanation can simply be made by dealing with the issue of cost _meta_end_dot_

 the washington health partnership is expected by its proponents to cost at the beginning around _meta_dollor_ref_ billion per year most of which would be funded by an increased payroll tax the rate of which would be set by a board established to oversee the program _meta_end_dot_

 the payroll tax rate necessary to raise the _meta_dollor_ref_ billion needed to initially fund the program has been estimated at no less than _meta_number_ref_ percent a significant increase in washingtonians tax burden _meta_end_dot_

 in fact the _meta_dollor_ref_ billion in additional tax revenue needed to get the washington health partnership off the ground represents more in tax revenue than the state currently takes in through sales income and corporate taxes combined _meta_end_dot_

 as michael tanner the cato institute s director of health and welfare studies explained during his october _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ testimony to the wisconsin assembly committee on health and health care reform when the badger state was considering the exact same proposal the payroll tax would theoretically be split with the employee paying four percent and the employer paying _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ percent _meta_end_dot_

 further small businesses the life s blood of america s state and national economies will be hardest hit by the severe payroll tax increase _meta_end_dot_

 most small businesses pay less than ten percent payroll tax and few provide health insurance _meta_end_dot_

 therefore these businesses will see their tax burdens per worker skyrocket without any corresponding savings that would come from no longer having to provide employee health plans _meta_end_dot_

 in order to relieve themselves of this added hardship businesses can and will leave the state as a result of the washington health partnership s passage _meta_end_dot_

 given that washington s tax burden is already significantly worse than its neighboring states the increased weight of the washington health partnership is an almost certain recipe for slowed economic growth and lost jobs _meta_end_dot_

 the non partisan tax foundation currently ranks washington _meta_number_ref_th in the nation in terms of state and local tax burden rankings go from _meta_number_ref_ highest tax burden to _meta_number_ref_ least tax burden _meta_end_dot_

 by comparison idaho ranks _meta_number_ref_th oregon _meta_number_ref_th and montana _meta_number_ref_st _meta_end_dot_

 washington state has been enjoying moderate job growth in recent months and years _meta_end_dot_

 passing a bill like sb _meta_number_ref_ would do much to reverse that trend and would severely damage the state s economy not to mention the state s health insurance and care market _meta_end_dot_

 even if businesses do not relocate to escape the increase in their payroll costs the national rate of health care inflation is too far ahead of projected wage and revenue increases for the washington health partnership to avoid running a sever deficit within the next few years _meta_end_dot_

 further with its health care by geographical area framework sen _meta_end_dot_

 keiser s retread proposal would not only eliminate consumers ability to choose their providers but would in tanner s words set up a perverse set of incentives that will encourage healthy and insured residents to move out of state while also encouraging uninsured and sick from out of state to relocate to or at least take jobs in washington _meta_end_dot_

 this would significantly strain the health facilities in the state s border areas acting as a magnet for those to whom it alone extends coverage such as undocumented immigrants and extends low income pregnant women _meta_end_dot_

 this outcome would increase program costs exponentially while also creating several other problems for washington state _meta_end_dot_

 beyond these issues the washington health partnership would create a situation in which health care is rationed and prices are inflated due to the outlawing of competition _meta_end_dot_

 rather than cause serious damage to the health care market and to the state s economy as a whole washington should seek common sense reform to help solve the health care crisis _meta_end_dot_

 opening up the market to greater competition decreasing the number of procedures and operations whose coverage is mandated by law from the current total of _meta_number_ref_ including port wine stain birthmark removal would do a great deal to alleviate the current biggest problem with health insurance its affordability _meta_end_dot_

 further the state should amend its insurance laws to allow the sale of any health insurance plan approved for sale by any state something which is not allowed by most states but which would work wonders in bringing down health insurance costs through the tried and true method of simple competition _meta_end_dot_

 regardless where washington goes from here further regulation of its health care market will only serve to exacerbate the state s problems _meta_end_dot_

 instead of repackaging recently failed attempts to legislate an area of the market that is already suffering from over regulation the state legislature of washington should seek out real reform reform that would decrease government involvement increase consumer choice and work to the benefit of the market as a whole _meta_end_dot_
