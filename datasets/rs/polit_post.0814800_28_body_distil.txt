  cnn has a rather bizarre way of honoring our troops today _meta_end_dot_

 here is a screenshot of the left column of cnn com from just a few minute ago _meta_end_dot_

 note the bottom link hate grief keep soldiers alive and fighting _meta_end_dot_

 that link had been more prominent earlier today _meta_end_dot_

 it goes to this article _meta_end_dot_

 read it _meta_end_dot_

 you ll not be surprised to learn that the words hate and grief do not appear in the article despite the front page link suggesting otherwise _meta_end_dot_
