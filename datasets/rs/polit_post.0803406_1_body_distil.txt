  matt welch is dead on accurate and we really need to stop stigmatizing wealth creation in this election cycle _meta_end_dot_

 it is bad enough when those on the other side of the partisan divide do it but it was my understanding that republicans would actually respect legitimate wealth creation by entrepreneurs _meta_end_dot_

 alas that does not appear to be the case for whatever goofy reason _meta_end_dot_

 and yes senator mccain we are looking at you _meta_end_dot_

 you are in the driver s seat after all in seeking the republican presidential nomination _meta_end_dot_

 you are supposed to defend capitalism and wealth creation _meta_end_dot_

 we know that you enjoy taking potshots at mitt romney because you don t like him but when those potshots entail unjustified critiques of capitalism those of us on whom you would rely to help carry you through the general election with a strong republican turnout begin to wonder whether it is all really worth the effort to do so _meta_end_dot_

 stop making us wonder whether we d be better off if we would lose this election _meta_end_dot_

 would you please _meta_end_question_
