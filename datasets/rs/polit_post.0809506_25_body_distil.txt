  the spectacle grows plus amusant curiouser and curiouser _meta_end_dot_

 from the republican perspective the beauty of all of this is that while hillary clinton may no longer be able to win the democratic presidential nomination she is making it plain that she does not want obama to win the general election and she is doing all she can to delay the point at which obama can safely claim the democratic nomination and be able to unify the democratic party against john mccain and the republicans _meta_end_dot_

 i would suggest that someone make a movie about this eventually _meta_end_dot_

 but no movie can possibly be better than the real thing _meta_end_dot_
