  i just happened to be listening to one of redstate s friends larry kudlow _meta_end_dot_

 he has a saturday morning talk show on wabc radio here in new york city _meta_end_dot_

 he has a lot of intelligent things to say about the potential policy responses we can make to the current economic situation most of which i agree with _meta_end_dot_

 he does recommend that the federal reserve aggressively reduce short term interest rates _meta_end_dot_

 it s taken me longer than some people to come around to this point of view the only marginally sane jim cramer has been howling about this since august keep reading _meta_end_dot_

 expectations are widespread that the fed s open market committee will announce another _meta_number_ref_ basis point cut in the fed funds target rate at their next scheduled meeting on january _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 larry said that fed chairman bernanke should have announced a _meta_number_ref_ basis point cut in his congressional testimony this past week in addition to the _meta_number_ref_ we ll get at the end of the month _meta_end_dot_

 i would have been darned surprised if bernanke had done that _meta_end_dot_

 central bankers in general and bernanke in particular aren t generally given to bold action _meta_end_dot_

 it does have me thinking that we just might get a full percentage point cut at the fomc meeting _meta_end_dot_

 according to larry this would be enough to pull us out of whatever it is we re in right now _meta_end_dot_

 it might be a recession _meta_end_dot_

 it might just be a financial market panic _meta_end_dot_

 it might be a big pile of self fulfilling prophecy _meta_end_dot_

 it might be all of the above cutting by a full gallon would take the fed funds rate down to _meta_number_ref_ _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 among other things this would un invert the yield curve given that the _meta_number_ref_ year us treasury note finished up again yesterday to yield an incredibly low my perennial description of this rate _meta_number_ref_ _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 it would also and larry made this point too have the effect of increasing the money supply _meta_end_dot_

 there s a bit of subtlety to this which i think escapes many people especially given all the mishugas we ve had in this political year about inflation supposedly caused by not being on a gold standard _meta_end_dot_

 as it turns out growth in the us money supply has been stagnant for about two years now _meta_end_dot_

 the open market desk at the new york federal reserve bank constantly adds to and subtracts from the money supply for a variety of technical and policy reasons usually around _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ am eastern time on trading days _meta_end_dot_

 but if you examine their doings closely you ll see that they very rarely make what are called permanent changes to the money supply _meta_end_dot_

 the last time they did this to my knowledge was in april _meta_number_ref_ well before last year s financial crises exploded into public view _meta_end_dot_

 cutting the fed funds rate has the indirect effect of increasing the availability of lendable funds in the economy so it has a similar effect _meta_end_dot_

 but how low can the funds rate go and how low should it go _meta_end_question_

 more to the point will lower short rates help get the us economy back on a strong growth track _meta_end_question_

 the last cycle of monetary easing ran from _meta_number_ref_ to early _meta_number_ref_ with the fed funds target rate bottoming out at _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 should we go back there _meta_end_question_

 i think that would be well worth considering _meta_end_dot_

 what s the downside risk _meta_end_question_

 well regarding this point i m glad to see that kudlow has been reading my posts at redstate over the last few months _meta_end_exclamation_

 he s a thousand percent right when he says that increasing the money supply is only a good thing to do if there is a productive place for the money to go _meta_end_dot_

 otherwise you get inflation in one form or another _meta_end_dot_

 during the _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ period it found its way into asset prices rather than the more traditional wage and consumer prices but as i said here yesterday the risk of inflation is now judged by bond market investors to be essentially non existent _meta_end_dot_

 larry said much the same thing this morning on wabc radio _meta_end_dot_

 therefore there is a lot of room to cut rates _meta_end_dot_

 and that unfortunately brings us to consider the political risks _meta_end_dot_

 have you ever tried to step on the gas pedal and the brakes simultaneously _meta_end_question_

 you burn a lot of rubber and gasoline but don t get anywhere in particular _meta_end_dot_

 since the best currently available information predicts a democratic sweep in the november elections we have to expect that next year will bring a raft of policies that will have the effect if not the intention of reducing the ability of businesses to grow the us economy _meta_end_dot_

 that means that if we create a lot of additional liquidity now by sometime next year it will stop finding productive job creating places to go and start generating inflation somewhere somehow instead _meta_end_dot_

 and thus will be laid the seeds of the next recession to follow after this one _meta_end_dot_
