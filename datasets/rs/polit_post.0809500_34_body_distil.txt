  someone once wrote to ask a question jarring in its directness how should we argue against socialism _meta_end_question_

 it is commonly supposed of course that the question of socialism is a somewhat antique one _meta_end_dot_

 we re past all that you know it s so eighties _meta_end_dot_

 but then one reads or hears something striking enough in its implications that one is reminded that the issue is very far from settled _meta_end_dot_

 it is quite pressing a menace even though it wears new disguises _meta_end_dot_

 so perhaps the reader will forgive me my presumption as i endeavor to advise my correspondent on the question of how to argue against socialism _meta_end_dot_

 to my mind this is more an undertaking more suitable to the art of rhetoric than to social science dialectic _meta_end_dot_

 it is not a matter of forensics applied to sociology and economics by the purely rational faculties of the mind _meta_end_dot_

 it is true enough that reason applied to evidence in a social scientific method has demonstrated the falsity of the architecture of socialism _meta_end_dot_

 professors hayek and von mises did much of that work _meta_end_dot_

 but it seems to me that we are not going to repel this menace by statistics alone _meta_end_dot_

 technical reason will not be enough _meta_end_dot_

 rhetoric i must confess i am a great admirer of that noble discipline a greater admirer still because it has fallen of late into such undeserved disrepute _meta_end_dot_

 but good rhetoric is always true rhetoric it is sentiment inspired to vindicate a just cause _meta_end_dot_

 indeed i think that precisely the problem under examination here the problem of socialism has a great deal do to with the discredit of rhetoric as an art and it must be a very real problem indeed if it has cast under suspicion the art whose champions go by names like cicero burke and lincoln _meta_end_dot_

 but the art of rhetoric has fallen into disrepute because we have forgotten the principle propounded by aristotle that what makes a sophist is not his faculty but his moral purpose _meta_end_dot_

 our task is one for the true rhetorician who sensitive at all times that man is a dualistic creature one that both reasons and feels may discern paths by which persuasion can be effected _meta_end_dot_

 his target will not be man s reason alone but his sentiment not merely his head but his gut _meta_end_dot_

 his task of persuasion will be directed at the chest as c _meta_end_dot_

 s _meta_end_dot_

 lewis put it the seat of magnanimity the union of head and gut of emotions organized by trained habit into stable sentiment head and heart in union reason commanding the persuasive resources of emotion this is a man in full _meta_end_dot_

 richard weaver wrote that rhetoric is indeed one of the few arts that speaks to the whole man _meta_end_dot_

 thus we must aim by means of a true rhetoric to expose socialism as an ideal to remove from it the appeal to the emotions of idealism the nobility of purpose which can so easily overawe the old earthy questions of practice implementation unintended consequence _meta_end_dot_

 we must expose the false rhetoric behind it the conceit of the socialists _meta_end_dot_

 the urgency of this task should be clear to readers here _meta_end_dot_

 one of our national parties preaches socialism almost nakedly and the other party can manage only a tepid resistance to it _meta_end_dot_

 we have one party which at all times tends when faced with challenge or opportunity to augment and enlarge the instruments of the state _meta_end_dot_

 that this party has made concessions and compromises with capitalism does not diminish its essence for indeed nothing is so certain as that capitalist enterprises individually or in groups may combine with the state may connive together with it at socialism in certain sectors industries projects _meta_end_dot_

 it is an error to my way of thinking to suppose that capitalism cannot coexist with socialism often there are strong alliances between firms and the state _meta_end_dot_

 in any case america has a socialist party and a capitalist party the latter of which is partially hamstrung by its acquiescence in the agenda of the former _meta_end_dot_

 all this is merely to establish why i think socialism is a real menace _meta_end_dot_

 we have one party that wants it and another that can t really get up the nerve to say no _meta_end_dot_

 so how to argue against socialism _meta_end_question_

 we must abolish the ideal of socialism _meta_end_dot_

 deprive it of the aura of noble ideal which our intellectuals in their folly granted it and it will whither _meta_end_dot_

 the power of the socialist is his deceitful appeal to the assumed nobility of his ideal _meta_end_dot_

 it will hardly matter to the socialist rhetorician that socialism doesn t work for his concern is not with what works and what does not rather his concern to conjure ideals sweet intoxicating ideals and project them onto a blank screen as it were isolated from concrete history and daily life _meta_end_dot_

 his purpose is to summon castles in the sky and from these deduce a grand sweeping unreal critique now implicit now explicit of reality _meta_end_dot_

 in this glow of unreality the critique appears unanswerable _meta_end_dot_

 therefore he will point to those who go hungry or those whose sickness could be but is not alleviated or to any number of vivid privations all with pressing implication that his system socialism can end the privations _meta_end_dot_

 this is a cunning rhetorical device _meta_end_dot_

 he is not engaging in dialectics in a learned discourse a sober weighing of means and ends on the question of which philosophy ought to guide our political economy _meta_end_dot_

 he aims rather at stimulating our passionate but unguided sentiment guilt mostly _meta_end_dot_

 for him what is important is that our emotions are troubled that we feel the bite of personal mortification in perceiving our own comfort and plenty in contrast to what other lack _meta_end_dot_

 and since he is still as yet a merely hypothetical character i feel no qualms about imputing to him motives of a baser sort _meta_end_dot_

 i say then that he aims to mislead our sentiment and thereby subvert our reason _meta_end_dot_

 the method of the socialist rhetorician in fine is to subtly force a decisive comparison between ideal and practice namely between the ideal of socialism and the practice of capitalism _meta_end_dot_

 he is the quintessential sophist of aristotle s dictum _meta_end_dot_

 his moral purpose is dubious because his rhetoric hinges on a deceit _meta_end_dot_

 he will not play fair he is a cheat _meta_end_dot_

 he has put everything at the service of his politics including any sense of honorable argumentation _meta_end_dot_

 or maybe he no longer remembers what that is _meta_end_dot_

 anyway the state of rhetoric in our day can be pretty well suggested by the fact that this simple principle of discrepancy must be repeated unceasingly _meta_end_dot_

 actual capitalism is confronted by a bright shiny imaginary ideal _meta_end_dot_

 the inquisitor of unreality approaches _meta_end_dot_

 the tangled mess of actual contemporary american medicine must compete with free health care for all _meta_end_dot_

 the ever human recklessness and greed of speculators is set against the image of the perfectly regulated financial sector _meta_end_dot_

 that a sophist can get away quite easily with an unaccountable shift or elision from ideal to reality and back again as often as is needful to his designs tells us that men are not trained properly _meta_end_dot_

 stable sentiment has not been cultivated in them sufficient enough to recognize and call out a dirty trick when it appears _meta_end_dot_

 our rhetoric is insufficient to the challenge of the promoters of a system with means our servility _meta_end_dot_

 what i should like to recommend to my correspondent who so boldly demanded how to argue against the servile state which is socialism is this _meta_end_dot_

 he should forget attacking socialism because it doesn t work the politics of it and begin attacking it on its own principles the philosophy guiding it _meta_end_dot_

 admittedly this is a greater burden on the intellect but i believe my correspondent is up to the challenge _meta_end_dot_

 what he must demonstrate is that socialism is evil even if it does what it says it will do that to destroy the principle of private property is to amputate an irreplaceable part of what it means to be human what it means to labor and create and be fruitful in religious terms that it is a heresy an innovation that will annihilate a revolt against the nature of man and the natural order of the world in short that it fails not because it doesn t work but rather it doesn t work because it fails fails utterly to reflect in any meaningful way the truth about man and society _meta_end_dot_
