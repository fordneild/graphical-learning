  well at least nedra will miss him _meta_end_dot_

 read on _meta_end_dot_

 john edwards has been rumored to be looking at supporting senator obama s campaign which at this point could use all the help that it can get but the article indicated that he has officially not yet made a decision on that topic _meta_end_dot_

 in this his campaign demonstrates the same half an octave up or down mentality that has been its bane since the campaign started _meta_end_dot_

 if he was going to leave and endorse he should have done it earlier and possibly improved obama s chances or he should have waited until after _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ and given himself a better chance of playing kingmaker at the convention _meta_end_dot_

 it s precisely this sort of neither here nor there thinking that made many progressives wish that his wife was actually the one running _meta_end_dot_

 so ciao former senator edwards _meta_end_dot_

 i would take more joy in your departure from this race if i had also taken your presence in it more seriously in the first place _meta_end_dot_

 as it is i can only hope that whichever campaign you end up in you just keep doing whatever it is that you do so well _meta_end_dot_

 for a given value of well moe truth be told while i don t really respect elizabeth edwards political opinions at all i do respect her as a person and my prayers and good wishes to her in her current condition _meta_end_dot_

 for that matter she d have been twice the candidate that her husband was _meta_end_dot_
