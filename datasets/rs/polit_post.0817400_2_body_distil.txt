  this just screams well we re a family site but it rhymes with trick _meta_end_dot_

 presumptuous ain t he _meta_end_question_

 i guess on the bright side they didn t scrap the arrows which i guess we can read as a subtle signal that he is not in fact going to cancel the war _meta_end_dot_

 consider this an open thread _meta_end_dot_

 next week i hear he s painting his house white and adding a truman balcony _meta_end_dot_

 last thought am i the only one who thinks possum when i see his motto in latin _meta_end_question_
