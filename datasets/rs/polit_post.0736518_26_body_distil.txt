 thomas crown will return _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 someday _meta_end_dot_

 blackhedd _meta_number_ref_ will be a year of fundamental but largely unseen transformations in the global economy _meta_end_dot_

 the three most important drivers will be continued demand growth and foreign direct investment in emerging economies a global credit freeze _meta_end_dot_

 the emergence of sovereign wealth funds as critical players in global finance _meta_end_dot_

 these drivers will completely re do the basis for global economic activity but surface effects will dominate the news masking the deeper movements _meta_end_dot_

 among these effects will be a continuation of pretty decent economic performance including strong job creation and not bad wage growth in the us and europe _meta_end_dot_

 japan will not recover from its current endemic low growth _meta_end_dot_

 continued extremely low interest rates in all markets _meta_end_dot_

 investment grade corporate credits now approximately a _meta_dollor_ref_ trillion market will participate in the low rate environment _meta_end_dot_

 all other credit classes will suffer from low issuance poor liquidity and high rate spreads _meta_end_dot_

 wild card factors will include food price inflation and political instability in oil producing regions _meta_end_dot_

 don t look to the prices of oil gold and the dollar for clues to the outlook _meta_end_dot_

 copper and nickel will give better clues _meta_end_dot_

 the outlook for us financial markets is opaque _meta_end_dot_

 a year ago in this space i predicted that _meta_number_ref_ would close with the djia at _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 it was at that level a week ago and will finish the year at about _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 but for _meta_number_ref_ i make no predictions whatsoever in specific markets _meta_end_dot_

 i would be least surprised to see stocks finish around _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ with massive swings in either direction during the year _meta_end_dot_

 the outlook for the us economy is very complex _meta_end_dot_

 aggregate measures gdp productivity job and wage growth will continue moderately strong in spite of ongoing distress in the housing construction sectors and there will be no official recession _meta_end_dot_

 however the top level news will mask extreme sectoral rotation as the us rapidly adjusts to new conditions in the global economy _meta_end_dot_

 among other things this means that traditional job security and benefits guarantees will continue to weaken _meta_end_dot_

 therefore the _meta_number_ref_ political season will see a surprisingly strong bottom up emphasis on healthcare issues while immigration issues will recede _meta_end_dot_

 whoever wins the _meta_number_ref_ election the groundwork will be laid for a national healthcare delivery system of one kind or another _meta_end_dot_

 this will be the most important policy change in terms of us economic management _meta_end_dot_

 geopolitically the year will see surprising stability as a balanced multipolar world similar to that of the late _meta_number_ref_th century begins to emerge _meta_end_dot_

 there will be no lack of regional conflicts all of them likely to be easily contained _meta_end_dot_

 the potential for escalation to global conflict remains very small but not zero _meta_end_dot_

 the beijing olympics in august will come off with no major disruptions and will be judged a complete success _meta_end_dot_

 don t forget that the targets of this grand pr campaign are not in the us _meta_end_dot_

 the us elections are a total tossup _meta_end_dot_

 i predict that neither john edwards nor ron paul will be elected president of the us _meta_end_dot_

 no other outcome will surprise me _meta_end_dot_
