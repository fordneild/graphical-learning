  i have two groups i want to mention today _meta_end_dot_

 and let me apologize too _meta_end_dot_

 i ve been meaning to put this stuff up all week but have been filling in at a local am station from _meta_number_ref_ to _meta_number_ref_ each morning plus fulfilling job duties and city council duties _meta_end_dot_

 it has taken me all week to get this stuff up _meta_end_dot_

 there are two organizations out there i want to highlight on this good friday _meta_end_dot_

 both do very good work _meta_end_dot_

 the first is the business alliance for america s veterans _meta_end_dot_

 any business can become part of the alliance with more information found at biz_meta_number_ref_vets org _meta_end_dot_

 my friend richard senninger is the executive director _meta_end_dot_

 the alliance supports protecting veterans benefits works on job placement for vets regardless of any disabilities and works to increase consumer awareness about businesses who are members of the alliance _meta_end_dot_

 the second is with my own eyes which is an amazing website _meta_end_dot_

 the site allows people to upload first hand accounts of well in their own words if you are in the charitable mood please consider stopping by either of these sites and if you business is interested consider joining the business alliance for america s veterans _meta_end_dot_
