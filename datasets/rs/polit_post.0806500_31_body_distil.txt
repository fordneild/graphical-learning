  most of the rest of joe wilson s huffpo post was at best nonsensical blathering of course but that s all right this will do nicely _meta_end_dot_

 so _meta_end_dot_

 joe wilson staking his entire accrued reputation among a certain sort on his ability to trivialize senator barack obama s foreign policy experience _meta_end_dot_

 all i can say is dayenu _meta_end_dot_

 ps allahpundit s gleeful too and at worst the futile attempts of a not quite as clever as he thinks nonentity to try one more turn at revisionist history before objective reality steps in _meta_end_dot_

 just so we re clear on that _meta_end_dot_
