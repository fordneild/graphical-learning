  so there is this campaign to condemn ronald reagan for supposedly relying on richard nixon s southern strategy to get elected to the presidency in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 paul krugman is elbowing competitors out of the way to issue the condemnations _meta_end_dot_

 but i think that perhaps krugman may have committed some innocent mistakes _meta_end_dot_

 there is a lot more below _meta_end_dot_

 read on _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 first of all krugman repeatedly brings up the issue of reagan s _meta_number_ref_ speech in mississippi to prove that the _meta_number_ref_th president was a racist _meta_end_dot_

 as long as two years ago jon henke called krugman on this issue and corrected his many errors _meta_end_dot_

 the issue also got covered here _meta_end_dot_

 google is a powerful tool and one would think that someone like krugman would use it to see whether his arguments have stood up under the scrutiny of others _meta_end_dot_

 evidently on this issue krugman hasn t taken the past corrections of his charges into account _meta_end_dot_

 indeed he doesn t even acknowledge them except in the most oblique terms thus ensuring that people won t know much about krugman s critics and what their criticisms entail _meta_end_dot_

 but i m sure that s an innocent mistake _meta_end_dot_

 i suppose that i could also point out that nowadays caring about racial equality and wanting to bring it about entails things like supporting school choice an issue which has huge support in minority communities since it is a surefire way to improve education and lift people out of poverty _meta_end_dot_

 it also entails coming up with innovative ways to move society past its current over reliance on palliatives like affirmative action to remedy the past wrongs of racism _meta_end_dot_

 we recall of course that during the clinton administration we were promised that government would mend not end affirmative action _meta_end_dot_

 well government certainly didn t end it and mending affirmative action is apparently just the same as keeping the status quo when it comes to affirmative action one wishes that paul krugman would at least address these issues _meta_end_dot_

 most of the time of course krugman appears to ignore the issues of school choice and affirmative action reform altogether evidently not believing them worthy of discussion _meta_end_dot_

 if he has ever given any kind of serious examination to these issues i am certainly unaware of it _meta_end_dot_

 but i m sure that s just an innocent mistake _meta_end_dot_

 speaking of whispering racial campaigns perhaps krugman would be good enough to take on the slur that if you are an african american who works in a republican administration like condoleezza rice or colin powell or if you are an african american who also happens to be a conservative like clarence thomas or thomas sowell you are somehow a race traitor whatever that means _meta_end_dot_

 to the best of my knowledge krugman has not addressed this slur _meta_end_dot_

 it would be nice as well for krugman to take some history into account _meta_end_dot_

 for ever election cycle starting in _meta_number_ref_ the new deal coalition krugman so evidently reveres and cherishes was a dominant force indeed the dominant force in american politics _meta_end_dot_

 just about every election from _meta_number_ref_ to _meta_number_ref_ involved a contest between new deal democrats on the one side and me too republicans on the other who were willing to do just about everything the new deal democrats wanted to do only slower _meta_end_dot_

 i say just about because the only time the republicans did not put up a me too candidate for the presidency prior to _meta_number_ref_ was in _meta_number_ref_ when barry goldwater put forth a distinct conservative vision in opposition to the traditional new deal way of doing things _meta_end_dot_

 but that doesn t really count as far as the new deal partisans are concerned since goldwater got stomped in part thanks to people like bill moyers who worked for lyndon johnson and was responsible for dirty tricks against the goldwater campaign like the one discussed here _meta_end_dot_

 paul krugman hasn t exactly gone out of his way to denounce such dirty tricks _meta_end_dot_

 i m sure that it must be an innocent mistake the _meta_number_ref_ campaign broke the mold in that it featured a conservative presidential candidate who not only won the election but won it going away and took a sledgehammer to the new deal coalition in the process _meta_end_dot_

 oh to be sure elements of that coalition remain and can be reassembled _meta_end_dot_

 but _meta_number_ref_ was traumatic for new deal acolytes especially because in the process of losing an election by a rout significant portions of the new deal coalition defected to the republican side in the process _meta_end_dot_

 as theodore white pointed out in his book the _meta_number_ref_ campaign partisans like paul krugman don t want _meta_number_ref_ to repeat itself _meta_end_dot_

 as mentioned above krugman reveres the new deal and its legacy and he doesn t want to see the remnants of the new deal coalition scattered and annihilated beyond recognition _meta_end_dot_

 quite the contrary krugman hopes perhaps against hope that the new deal coalition can reconstitute itself and once again march from victory to victory as it did during the heyday of franklin roosevelt and lyndon johnson _meta_end_dot_

 and having seen the movie of _meta_number_ref_ and its feature scene involving the defection of key members of the civil rights movement over to the republican side krugman wants to do everything in his power to stop the filming of a sequel _meta_end_dot_

 thus this renewed argument over whether ronald reagan was a racist the facts provided in the links above notwithstanding _meta_end_dot_

 again paul krugman hasn t addressed those facts _meta_end_dot_

 additionally he hasn t addressed why if reagan was such a blatant and obvious racist people like ralph abernathy and hosea williams were willing to support him _meta_end_dot_

 abernathy and williams were not stupid and surely wouldn t have been taken in by a genuine racist pretending to lack a prejudiced bone in his body _meta_end_dot_

 and abernathy and williams never stopped caring about the cause of civil rights so it is hard to believe that they would have made common cause with a racist _meta_end_dot_

 ronald reagan s ability to draw support across racial lines in _meta_number_ref_ and to disrupt and gravely wound the new deal coalition in the process throws a huge monkey wrench into the gears of the argument that in _meta_number_ref_ reagan openly and notoriously relied on the southern strategy to propel himself to the presidency _meta_end_dot_

 and krugman doesn t even lift a finger to argue otherwise or to take reagan s support in the civil rights community into account when making his arguments
