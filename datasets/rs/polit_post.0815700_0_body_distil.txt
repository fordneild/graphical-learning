  harry reid and the senate democrats pledged to hold a confirmation vote on three of president bush s circuit court nominees prior to memorial day then broke their word and allowed only one to be considered on the floor thinking that their continued obstructionism in the face of a republican minority and lame duck president would go unchallenged and without consequence _meta_end_dot_

 today senate republicans led by mitch mcconnell r ky began to pay back the democrats for their obstructionist bullying tactics _meta_end_dot_

 mitch mcconnell shut down the floor today by forcing the clerk to read all _meta_number_ref_ or so pages of barbara boxer s climate change bill making it essentially impossible for anything to happen in the senate all day or technically until the reading is complete _meta_end_dot_

 in addition to stopping all progress on the legislation currently on the floor this action will have the effect of throwing off reid s entire legislative calendar yes the same one he somehow forgot to add those promised pre memorial day confirmation votes to _meta_end_dot_

 there are few things the minority can do in the senate more disruptive to the majority than removing their ability to manage the floor _meta_end_dot_

 reid and boxer d ca have been seen very agitatedly conversing on the floor during the reading clearly boxer neither wants to hear nor wants anybody else to hear her bill read in so public a location as the senate chamber _meta_end_dot_

 mcconnell s action is designed to send a very specific message to reid boxer leahy and the rest of the senate democrats that republicans will not stand by while they hedge obstruct and otherwise refuse to move on the nominations of qualified judges to the bench _meta_end_dot_

 read on _meta_end_dot_

 how does this work _meta_end_question_

 by disallowing the hallowed senate principle of unanimous consent _meta_end_dot_

 sen _meta_end_dot_

 boxer offered up a substitute amendment to the bill this morning _meta_end_dot_

 that bill was to be the basis of the day s debate _meta_end_dot_

 ordinarily the clerk would simply read the title of a bill aloud and then turn things over to the floor leader who would then then request unanimous consent to dispense with a further reading of the bill _meta_end_dot_

 mcconnell denied that consent today instead forcing the clerk to read aloud the entire substitute amendment by boxer _meta_end_dot_

 while the clerk is reading no senators can speak except to ask for consent to dispense with reading of the bill or make a motion to adjourn both of which will be denied and no further amendments can be offered _meta_end_dot_

 when the reading is completed reid durbin boxer et al will take to the floor to gripe and protest and accuse the gop of stalling their climate change bill out of a desire to avoid debate _meta_end_dot_

 republicans though are eager to debate this since they re more than will to talk about democrats raising energy prices when gas is nearing _meta_dollor_ref_ per gallon _meta_end_dot_

 this is not about a fear of debate rather this is about broken democrat promises and inaction on judicial nominees though such action at this time has the wonderful added benefit of allowing more time and visibility to expose the detrimental extent and complexity of the democrats climate change bill _meta_end_dot_

 nice work sen _meta_end_dot_

 mcconnell _meta_end_dot_
