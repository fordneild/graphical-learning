  obama on gun control after yesterday s shootings in his home state _meta_beep_ref_ hmmm that should go over real well in the texas primary on march _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 just as the national dems seemed to have learned their lesson on this issue expect to hear a lot about guns if obama is the nominee for two reasons _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 guns are one of the few areas where mccain has a pretty solid conservative record _meta_end_dot_

 the nra s leadership hates mccain due mainly to mccain feingold but on the actual gun rights issues he s voted pretty consistently for gun rights e g he voted against the brady bill although mccain has also clashed with the nra over a gun show bill he co sponsored with joe lieberman _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 there is nonetheless a huge contrast to be drawn on this issue _meta_end_dot_

 obama is about as anti gun as you would expect from a chicago politician voted for assault weapons bans voted to limit the number of handguns a person could buy voted against lawsuit protections for gun manufacturers supported a national ban on concealed carry and worst of all voted against a bill protecting homeowners from being sued by burglars they shoot in their own homes _meta_end_dot_

 obama s not going to get a pass on that record from gun owners _meta_end_dot_
