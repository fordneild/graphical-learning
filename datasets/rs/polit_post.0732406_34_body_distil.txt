  behold the evidence here _meta_end_dot_

 you know i happen to think that the surge had a great deal to do with the improvements baghdad along with the rest of iraq is witnessing and experiencing _meta_end_dot_

 but frankly i don t care who takes the credit so long as the reconstruction effort continues to proceed as successfully as it has over this past year _meta_end_dot_

 kinda makes you wonder why it is that the reality based community hasn t taken much notice of these improvements _meta_end_dot_

 or why it wants once again to short circuit them with yet another debate over withdrawal that is destined to fail being planned in congress _meta_end_dot_
