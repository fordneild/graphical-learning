  great leaders lead not because they seek power or privilege but because the people and the times demand it _meta_end_dot_

 john shadegg was ready to hand in his sword and return home _meta_end_dot_

 but with his decision today he has instead listened to the truly unprecedented voice of the people his colleagues his friends and even those who disagree with his views but respect him calling upon him to continue to serve the nation _meta_end_dot_

 we at redstate are glad john shadegg saw fit to reconsider and we will be happier still to have him leading in congress in the critical days ahead _meta_end_dot_
