 chesterton was not an ungenerous man indeed it would be hard to find a more mistaken description for him _meta_end_dot_

 thus a stark judgment like the following one when one encounters it in his writings comes as something of a shock or tonic _meta_end_dot_

 never perhaps since the beginning of the world has there been an age that had less right to use the word progress than we whether this was ungenerous to the early twentieth century when chesterton wrote i leave aside for the moment in order to take up a more pressing question whether it is ungenerous to those who inherited that century s world namely us _meta_end_dot_

 now in order to merit any serious effort of moral examination our concept of progress must most emphatically be distinguished from mere material advancement _meta_end_dot_

 the latter is not in strict common sense a subject of moral inquiry _meta_end_dot_

 that more people have wealth does not tell us anything about the nature of wealth _meta_end_dot_

 that more technical knowledge is available will give us no hint as to how knowledge ought to be used _meta_end_dot_

 more importantly material progress is strictly speaking not dependent upon the moral fiber of a society _meta_end_dot_

 as far as we can tell the gain to be had in treachery plunder fraud is alas not a feature of the world within our power to remove _meta_end_dot_

 the popular celebration of material progress on the whole understandable must be viewed with some caution for it risks pushing us into that perilous and impious habit of mind which lord acton said sanctifies success _meta_end_dot_

 some rather narrow calvinists once thought material prosperity was evidence of sanctity and acton s reproach was aimed at one very successful calvinist oliver cromwell _meta_end_dot_

 but acton s point holds all who succeed are not admirable nor is all success good _meta_end_dot_

 no to speak of an age being right or wrong in its use of the word progress is instantly to fling oneself into all the vague boisterous inescapable world of what is called moralism _meta_end_dot_

 it is to begin that quintessential of human activity of moral judgment _meta_end_dot_

 how then ought we to think about progress _meta_end_question_

 and how much real progress has modern man made _meta_end_question_

 let us take the last _meta_number_ref_ years _meta_end_dot_

 it must be acknowledged a careful study will disclose hard evidence against us _meta_end_dot_

 for almost a century virtually every step of real progress we have made has in fact been a grinding gritty effort of restoration or reclamation from some mad heresy which was itself advertised and accepted as progress _meta_end_dot_

 we sundered the nazi state concatenated of the heresies of race and evolution a synonym of progress and socialism by laying waste to much of europe _meta_end_dot_

 we more peacefully subdued communism thus recovering our ancient orthodoxies on property and sin but before this struggle could be decided half the world was thrown into a new slavery while much of the remaining half was thrown into bitter strife _meta_end_dot_

 our successes on these counts are not diminished by noting that they were successes against progress but that is what they were _meta_end_dot_

 proclaimed their theories progress it is that millions upon millions accepted them as such _meta_end_dot_

 it is vital to understand this _meta_end_dot_

 for some time the theoretical wave of the future was that races no less than species move progressively through history their success sanctified and their supremacy authorized by the fact of their survival and prosperity _meta_end_dot_

 for a considerably longer time another progressive fad reigned which made scientific social organization a path to omnipotence property an obstacle and oppression and the planner who plunders the latter to empower the former a kind of god _meta_end_dot_

 i do not see how such doctrines can be refuted on the grounds of pure materialist science _meta_end_dot_

 they are evolution concrete and simple _meta_end_dot_

 today theorists apply darwinism to collections of thoughts called memes and tell us that charles darwin the great revolutionist overthrew god yet they strictly command us to never think of social darwinism again _meta_end_question_

 progressives from both factions nazi and communist supposed that the state by calculated intervention in private life can bestow upon men and societies ontological meaning _meta_end_dot_

 it can give life or take it away _meta_end_dot_

 the state was the agent of material progress human beings were raw material _meta_end_dot_

 these collectivist movements were not trivial they were hardly fleeting and they were extraordinarily popular not least with that class of people whose business is the public intellect _meta_end_dot_

 in truth they were wicked and they were sanguinary in the extreme but it is only in retrospect that we can fairly call them reactionary nazism and communism were in bare pulverizing fact the progress of the twentieth century _meta_end_dot_

 it is instructive to remember this and also remember that what objective progress was made in that era was made as a great brutal tragic counterattack against a heretical enemy who was vulnerable chiefly because of his overconfidence _meta_end_dot_

 so perhaps in this little sketch the reader may discern the lineaments of the conservative s suspicion of progress _meta_end_dot_
