  has anyone noticed this _meta_end_exclamation_

 the new republic caught hillary clinton strategizing a race baiting war against barack obama to push him out of the race no racial puns intended _meta_end_dot_

 this is unbelievable _meta_end_dot_

 if the republicans were to do this the press would burn crosses on their front lawns _meta_end_dot_

 if the democrats do it they seem to be getting a pass _meta_end_dot_

 in fact the republicans never actually do this but the democrats and press accuse them of doing it anyway _meta_end_dot_

 and now here we have proof that the democrats engage in racial warfare in their own primary system and what does the new york times give us _meta_end_question_

 crickets chirping _meta_end_dot_

 way to go defenders of all that is holy righteous fit to print and racially harmonious _meta_end_dot_
