  i m a bit troubled by information i have received this weekend on mike huckabee _meta_end_dot_

 a friend troubled by huckabee speaking at cornerstone church given it s pastor s virulent anti catholicism started digging around _meta_end_dot_

 if you notice on his personal financial disclosure huckabee is racking up big bucks on the campaign trail speaking at churches _meta_end_dot_

 now he does this it seems by funneling the speaking fees through his company _meta_number_ref_ stops inc _meta_end_dot_

 which was named after huckabee s book from hope to higher ground _meta_number_ref_ stops to restoring america s greatness _meta_end_dot_

 even throughout this year huckabee has earned thousands and thousands of dollars speaking at places usually religiously affiliated via the international speaker s bureau _meta_end_dot_

 all the money flows through _meta_number_ref_ stops inc _meta_end_dot_

 so here s the thing _meta_end_dot_

 an email was sent to the international speakers bureau seeking to get a huckabee speaking engagement _meta_end_dot_

 here s the response back a second email was sent to the isb specifically inquiring about huckabee speaking at a church _meta_end_dot_

 now it gets interesting this off _meta_end_dot_

 but how many other candidates are making personal money on the campaign trail _meta_end_question_

 and why milk churches but no one else _meta_end_question_

 on face the nation this morning huckabee said well from mark kilmer s review of the shows and that leads me back to today s event _meta_end_dot_

 is cornerstone church paying mike huckabee _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_question_

 and if so will he donate it to catholic charities _meta_end_question_
