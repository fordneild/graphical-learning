  al qaeda s military commander in afghanistan claims that the terror group coordinated the effort that led to the assassination of former pakistani prime minister benazir bhutto in rawalpindi pakistan yesterday _meta_end_dot_

 in a telephone interview with asia times online nsa boys did you get this one on tape mustafa abu al yazid said that the killing was part of an al qaeda plan to destabilize pakistan by hitting at precious american assets there _meta_end_dot_

 al yazid goes on to describe a fairly elaborate effort at tracking and targeting bhutto and president pervez musharraf involving indigenous extremist groups acting on orders from al qaeda _meta_end_dot_

 california yankee reports that us intelligence agencies have not yet confirmed that al qaeda was responsible _meta_end_dot_

 but couple the claim with reports from earlier this month that defeated al qaeda forces were moving out of iraq and heading back to afghanistan and it begs the question does bhutto s death mean that the iraq war is essentially over _meta_end_question_

 read on the united states still has enemies in iraq to be sure _meta_end_dot_

 chief among these is iran which through its intelligence services and proxies like moqtada al sadr and his mahdi army has been fighting a low grade shooting war against the us almost since saddam s statue fell _meta_end_dot_

 the us will need to maintain troops in iraq long into the foreseeable future to keep iran in check _meta_end_dot_

 it will also need a military presence inside iraq to prevent backsliding among iraq s various factions _meta_end_dot_

 the calm that has been established by the troop surge is a relative one and tenuous _meta_end_dot_

 having built the nation keeping it together is the next great strategic effort _meta_end_dot_

 but everybody agrees that the troop surge has been a spectacular success at defeating al qaeda in iraq _meta_end_dot_

 both through military means and outreach to the population aqi s infrastructure and base of support have been nearly completely dismantled _meta_end_dot_

 it is still capable of smaller scale attacks and it still operates in areas like diyala province _meta_end_dot_

 but the key observer the local population increasingly sees aqi for what it is foreign troublemakers with no respect for human life or dignity that want to impose a harshly repressive interpretation of islam on the people without regard for local customs or traditions _meta_end_dot_

 in the wake of this defeat al qaeda may have finally woken up to the fact that iraq was as much about creating a kind of jihadist sink into which al qaeda would pour its resources only to seen them lost down the drain of american military might as it was about removing a brutal dictator who posed a national security threat to the united states _meta_end_dot_

 accordingly it is fleeing to afghanistan where it has suffered a lesser defeat and enjoys the protection of the mountains and free movement across the border with the lawless waziristan province of pakistan _meta_end_dot_

 all of which recalls the plan outlined by al yazid to asia times online _meta_end_dot_

 by taking out what it views as american assets al qaeda now hopes to plunge pakistan into chaos much as it once hoped to foment a civil war in iraq _meta_end_dot_

 and there are indications that the plan may be seeing some early success _meta_end_dot_

 the assassination of bhutto has led the next largest opposition figure former prime minister nawaz sharif to announce that his party will boycott the elections scheduled for january _meta_number_ref_th _meta_end_dot_

 the holding of fair and free elections is not possible in the presence of pervez musharraf _meta_end_dot_

 after the killing of benazir bhutto i announce that the pakistan muslim league n will boycott the elections he said _meta_end_dot_

 no elections mean that the political unrest which is fast becoming a blood feud will have no outlet for a resolution _meta_end_dot_

 simmering tensions in nuclear armed pakistan stoked by extremist elements backed by al qaeda is a perfect storm for united states national security _meta_end_dot_

 as undemocratic as musharraf s presence in power is he at least is able to keep the nuclear arsenal safe _meta_end_dot_

 should al qaeda be successful in descending pakistan into a civil war it could take advantage of the chaos to gain access to the nuclear stockpile _meta_end_dot_

 al qaeda may have admitted defeat in iraq with its new focus on pakistan _meta_end_dot_

 but that defeat has not reduced its ambitions _meta_end_dot_

 pakistan is a far bigger prize and one on which al qaeda seems to be setting its sights _meta_end_dot_
