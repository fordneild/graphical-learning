  howard dean and the democrats have had quite enough of their nomination fight and desperately want that fight to end try to dig up dirt on john mccain _meta_end_dot_

 both sides do this of course but few engage in the type of brazen not to mention appalling tactics covered here _meta_end_dot_

 this has to be one of the most pathetic ads i have ever seen in my life _meta_end_dot_

 it simply consists of a couple of smug twenty somethings or people who sound like twenty somethings talking about all of the things that john mccain is older than _meta_end_dot_

 the mind reels _meta_end_dot_

 is this all george soros and co _meta_end_dot_

 want us to base our vote on the fact that john mccain is older than dick freaking cheney _meta_end_question_

 say i hear that there are a lot of people who pompously preen and tut tut the sorry nature of our politics of course they only appear to do so when the sorry nature of our politics gives rise to a political meme that helps conservatives and libertarians _meta_end_dot_

 wonder if they will actually say anything concerning this mccain ad and how intellectually content free it is _meta_end_dot_

 or do they like the freak show in its current manifestation _meta_end_question_
