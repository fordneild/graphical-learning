  in comparison to nancy pelosi and her decision to shut down any voting on the colombia free trade agreement the bill clinton administration looks positively beneficent even to a rock ribbed republican _meta_end_dot_

 no matter what his wife thinks about it bill clinton made the right decision in going against democrat friendly labor unions and members of his own party taking a free trade agreement that george h w _meta_end_dot_

 bush started and passing it _meta_end_dot_

 nafta has proved to be an economic benefit to all three countries _meta_end_dot_

 today the democratic party is the protectionist party _meta_end_dot_

 hillary and obama are anti nafta and they join speaker pelosi in being anti free trade with colombia a nation that has made significant political economic and security related strides since president uribe was elected _meta_end_dot_

 in almost every relevant category colombia s progress has been remarkable _meta_end_dot_

 a nation that has made such improvements should be rewarded by the united states not slapped in the face but that s exactly what our democratic leaders are doing _meta_end_dot_

 here is what hillary said more below the fold _meta_end_dot_

 some improvement and change _meta_end_question_

 the murder rate of trade unionists is lower than the murder rate for the country as a whole which happened to drop _meta_percent_ref_ in the last five years _meta_end_dot_

 murders of trade unionists dropped _meta_percent_ref_ or _meta_percent_ref_ over the same period depending on who you talk to and most of those murders weren t even related to union activities _meta_end_dot_

 but that apparently isn t good enough _meta_end_dot_

 instead of strenghthening ties with a nation that has mutual interests with the u s hillary and obama and pelosi would rather put that relationship at risk _meta_end_dot_

 barack obama is a pea in the very same anti free trade pod as hillary and pelosi _meta_end_dot_

 there s not a dime s worth of difference between the three _meta_end_dot_

 how s that for a new kind of politics _meta_end_question_

 the way in which pelosi shut down the vote is particularly sleazy pelosi s decision is baffling when you consider our slowing economy and the fact that the trade pact clearly benefits the united states economically opposing this agreement makes no economic sense but apparently it makes political sense serving as a sop to labor unions and other protectionists in the donkey party _meta_end_dot_

 harvard professor and former new york times reporter edward schumacher matos blows away hillary s and obama s and pelosi s arguments against the agreement _meta_end_dot_

 a good part of the improvement in colombia is because farc the marxist guerilla group is losing its fight against the government _meta_end_dot_

 to quote abu muqawama colombia is really kicking the snot out of them these days _meta_end_dot_

 the result has been a safer country and aid from the u s _meta_end_dot_

 has helped in this endeavor _meta_end_dot_

 and why shouldn t we aid the colombia government against farc _meta_end_question_

 venezuelan president hugo chavez gives them money and arms according to der spiegel _meta_end_dot_

 speaking of chavez the socialist and wannabe dictator is continuing his grab for more power unto himself _meta_end_dot_

 the economist not satisfied with cement chavez has now set his sights on nationalizing steel and his armed forces are now occupying _meta_number_ref_ sugar plantations _meta_end_dot_

 apparently chavez is so afraid of getting whacked with a sugar cane that he s decided to make a preemptive strike _meta_end_dot_

 we have a golden opportunity to strengthen a relationship with an improving democratic nation that unfortunately is next door to a president who is a socialist kook _meta_end_dot_

 too bad our democratic leaders would rather let that opportunity pass _meta_end_dot_
