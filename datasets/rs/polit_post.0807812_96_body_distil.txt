  let us consider if you will two of barack obama s most formative advisers _meta_end_dot_

 one is tony rezko who obama s campaign admits contributed through himself and others around _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ to obama s campaign for the senate _meta_end_dot_

 that does not include money raised for obama s state legislative races _meta_end_dot_

 before the feds took down tony rezko he was a chief benefactor to obama who used obama to do his bidding in the legislature _meta_end_dot_

 obama now says he is intent on giving rezko s contributions to charity _meta_end_dot_

 then of course there is jeremiah wright _meta_end_dot_

 in addition to being obama s spiritual adviser mentor and campaign adviser until thrown under the bus this week i noticed tonight jeremiah wright like tony rezko is also a donor to obama s campaign _meta_end_dot_

 i wonder if obama now having moved to throw wright under the bus will give wright s contribution to charity _meta_end_dot_

 i also think we should refer back to machiavelli _meta_end_dot_

 there are always undesirable that cling to those climbing the ladder of power _meta_end_dot_

 there are always those who hang on try to make inroads with and claim some part of the politician _meta_end_dot_

 but tony rezko and jeremiah wright are two men that barack obama chose _meta_end_dot_

 he chose them for their influence _meta_end_dot_

 he was the hanger on _meta_end_dot_

 he was climbing their ladders _meta_end_dot_

 to quote machiavelli what does that say about obama s brains _meta_end_question_
