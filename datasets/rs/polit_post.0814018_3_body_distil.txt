  as has been talked about since it happened last thursday president bush s address to the israeli knesset marking the occasion of that country s _meta_number_ref_th anniversary sparked a manufactured political and media controversy that has lasted into this week _meta_end_dot_

 the problem wasn t what mr _meta_end_dot_

 bush said of course rather there were apparently several on the american left for whom a specific passage in mr _meta_end_dot_

 bush s speech in which he admonished those who would appease terrorists in hopes that concessions would change their inherently evil behavior hit a bit too close to home for their own personal comfort _meta_end_dot_

 the portion of the nearly _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ word speech that so rankled some on the american left was this _meta_number_ref_ word paragraph emphasis added read on _meta_end_dot_

 rather than take these words at face value and speak out in affirmation a number of individuals on the american left despite an absence of names in the statement appear to have taken mr _meta_end_dot_

 bush s warning against appeasement as a personal attack against their views and as usual during this time of war a challenge to their patriotism a subject that seems to perpetually inflame certain individuals inferiority complexes _meta_end_dot_

 senator joe biden d de exploded at the bush statement cursing and calling the warning against appeasement outrageous and ridiculous former senator tom daschle d sd called himself shocked and very very saddened by what he referred to as the president s unprecedented political attack unprecedented _meta_end_question_

 perhaps both mr _meta_end_dot_

 biden and mr _meta_end_dot_

 daschle have forgotten the actions of the man they supported to be president instead of bush _meta_end_dot_

 al gore who stood on saudi arabian soil in _meta_number_ref_ and named names condemning both bush and the entire u s _meta_end_dot_

 government for terrible abuses against arabs whom he charged to his arab audience had been indiscriminately rounded up and kept in unforgivable conditions in response to _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 or perhaps the charge of appeasement hits close enough to home for mr _meta_end_dot_

 daschle that he sees bush s didactic statement as far more personal an attack than gore s accusations of bush ever were _meta_end_dot_

 speaker of the house nancy pelosi d ca called the president s encouragement that all learn from history beneath the dignity of the office of the president and unworthy of our representation at the celebration of israel s _meta_number_ref_th anniversary this is of course the same speaker pelosi who has sat idly by while presidents clinton and carter have condemned the current officeholder both on foreign soil and in the media _meta_end_dot_

 further ms _meta_end_dot_

 pelosi apparently does not consider it beneath the dignity of her office to attack the president of the united states by name both in the media and from the floor of the house of representatives all while condemning the iraqi front in the global war on terror as a distraction from the real war on terror media personalities sprang out of the woodwork to offer instant condemnation of the president s statement as well _meta_end_dot_

 one particularly indignant writer will bunch of the philadelphia daily news shrieked from the pages of the paper s blog that bush had committed political treason by comparing the candidate of the u s _meta_end_dot_

 opposition party to appeasers of nazi germany and called on the democratic congress to play its constitutional role in ending this trauma by impeaching and convicting bush before even greater acts against the interest of america are wrongly committed in our name mr _meta_end_dot_

 bunch s view fit in with what seemed to be the consensus opinion of the american left heading into the weekend that president bush s statement about the dangers of appeasing and negotiating with enemies in which he named no names only even alluding directly to one man a republican senator was a verbal broadside directed at none other than senator barack obama the democrat candidate for president _meta_end_dot_

 whether this was a realistic view or not mr _meta_end_dot_

 obama stirred the pot almost immediately by releasing a statement in which he indignantly condemned the president for maybe sort of possibly alluding to him _meta_end_dot_

 it is sad that president bush would use a speech to the knesset on the _meta_number_ref_th anniversary of israel s independence to launch a false political attack he said _meta_end_dot_

 mr _meta_end_dot_

 obama may have very good reason to feel hot under the collar about warnings of the dangers of appeasement and of meeting with rogue leaders and terrorists in unilateral good faith _meta_end_dot_

 after all obama has already promised to personally meet without precondition with leaders of iran syria north korea and cuba _meta_end_dot_

 further he has been endorsed by hamas a terrorist organization that not only officially seeks the destruction of israel but oversees the firing of rockets into civilian areas of the jewish state on a daily basis _meta_end_dot_

 while mr _meta_end_dot_

 obama did not officially accept that endorsement and has accused john mccain of dishonest attacks when the subject is brought up obama campaign spokesman david axelrod did respond to the hamas statement of support by acknowledging that the comparison of obama to the late john f _meta_end_dot_

 kennedy by the terrorist spokesman referred to by axelrod as the gentleman from hamas was flattering however few if any would have directly linked bush s statement to mr _meta_end_dot_

 obama had he not thrust himself into the spotlight and so loudly declared himself the appeaser that mr _meta_end_dot_

 bush was attacking in israel last week _meta_end_dot_

 perhaps it is a result of obama s inherent belief in his own self worth that he simply cannot let a speech be made by a political leader without thinking that it is in some way about him _meta_end_dot_

 regardless his insistence on ensuring the spotlight positive or negative is focused on him has caused far more to consider the nature of mr _meta_end_dot_

 obama s foreign policy views in the light of historical experience _meta_end_dot_

 obama s meltdown in response to a speech that quite simply wasn t about him is instructive and is reminiscent of a story that bill cosby used to tell back in his days as a humorist _meta_end_dot_

 one day in shop class cosby recounted somebody put a bullet in the class furnace _meta_end_dot_

 of course it exploded and caused quite a ruckus in the class _meta_end_dot_

 the teacher looking for the culprit asked the students who had put that bullet in the shop class furnace _meta_end_dot_

 of course nobody responded _meta_end_dot_

 so the teacher tried a second tack somebody she said would have to be pretty low down to put a bullet in the shop class furnace again the students looked around at each other innocently none taking responsibility for the distraction _meta_end_dot_

 so the teacher tried a third time this time saying somebody s mother would have to be pretty low down for their son to put a bullet in the shop class furnace at this one boy leapt to his feet yelling to the teacher i didn t do it and don t talk about my mother whether president bush s well founded remarks before the knesset on thursday were aimed at barack obama or not mr _meta_end_dot_

 obama s extremely ill conceived decision to leap to his feet and cry i m not an appeaser and don t talk about my mother managed to convince any who did not think of him when speaking of appeasement and failed foreign policy that they should in fact begin to do so _meta_end_dot_

 the same goes for the rest of the democrats who took such great umbrage at the president s statement of historical truism _meta_end_dot_

 clearly their knee jerk reaction to being told one of the great lessons of history has revealed a deep insecurity about their own views and the results of the real world application of their own foreign policy prescriptions _meta_end_dot_

 in an ideal world the fact that such a disproportionately explosive reaction was provoked by a mere speech at the anniversary celebration of one of our closest allies will shock some of these individuals into a state of introspection causing them to look inward to find what it is in them that made them respond in such a way to a simple statement of historical fact _meta_end_dot_

 the world of course is not perfect and it is doubtful that anything will come from this but further political attacks and attempts to condemn any discussion of issues that might make some democrats feel uncomfortable _meta_end_dot_

 fortunately the more that these individuals shout i didn t do it and don t talk about my mother the more the spotlight of needless protestation shines on them and the more guilty they look in the eyes of the american people _meta_end_dot_
