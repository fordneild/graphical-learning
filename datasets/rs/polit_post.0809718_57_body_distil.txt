 casey was confronted with his statement on march _meta_number_ref_ that he would not commit to supporting any candidate before pennsylvania held its primary _meta_end_dot_

 he countered in typical junior casey form the reason i changed my mind was uh because i was uh when i said that an undecided voter _meta_end_dot_

 i became a decided voter and at that point you have to make a decision on cbs face the nation host bob schieffer asked dnc boss howard dean about the clintons claim that barack obama could not win the general election because he s an african american _meta_end_dot_

 dean said that all candidates say that about the other but that he doesn t think the clintons would mention that it was because obama was an african american _meta_end_dot_

 john mccain on fns _meta_end_dot_

 opening this week s fox news sunday host chris wallace aired his interview with john mccain taped friday at the national civil rights museum in memphis tennessee _meta_end_dot_

 nothing new came from this _meta_end_dot_

 wallace pointed out that mccain was campaigning in various places and mccain talked about the party of lincoln and the party of reagan reaching out to everyone _meta_end_dot_

 he said that california is in play this election _meta_end_dot_

 on the economy mccain pushed a limited role for the federal government but a robustness of purpose where the feds are required to act _meta_end_dot_

 wallace told mccain that the iraqi s basra operation had failed to remove the militias and mccain countered that the results were mixed _meta_end_dot_

 he opined that maliki should have waited until after the ongoing operations in mosul had been completed but that now the iraqis have basra and its valuable ports _meta_end_dot_

 he pointed out that it was moqtada al sadr who asked for the cease fire and winner s seldom do that in warfare _meta_end_dot_

 in his estimation the iraqi government performed pretty well john kerry on fns _meta_end_dot_

 wallace s next interview was with _meta_number_ref_ dem nominee and obama supporter jf kerry and you have to think that wallace s producers chose to interview kerry as obama s spokesman that team barry did not offer this guy to speak for them _meta_end_dot_

 it s a maybe cynical view of the producers but it is generous to the acumen of obama s peeps wallace quoted kerry in _meta_number_ref_ as saying the presidency was not the place for on the job training in foreign policy _meta_end_dot_

 this would apply to obama right _meta_end_question_

 kerry explained that obama had more foreign policy experience than did presidents reagan bush and clinton coming in _meta_end_dot_

 citing experts kerry said that mccain s iraq policy securing the country attracts jihadists and promotes violence so by seeking to keep troops in iraq fore _meta_number_ref_ years mccain was promoting violence _meta_end_dot_

 wallace countered that this was not what mccain meant when he said that we could have a presence for _meta_number_ref_ years and kerry argued that he was to prove it he cited an interview mccain gave with charlie rose four months ago in which mccain said we couldn t keep troops in iraq _meta_end_dot_

 wallace accused kerry of conflating the two interviews _meta_end_dot_

 kerry said that he was not conflating them _meta_end_dot_

 wallace pointed out that kerry had asked john mccain to be his veep in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 kerry explained that mccain in _meta_number_ref_ was different from mccain today the nomination mccain wallace said that mccain has always been the same on iraq _meta_end_dot_

 kerry said that he and mccain had never really gotten to the point of a veep discussion _meta_end_dot_

 kerry said that we could not keep a base in iraq like we have elsewhere because japan doesn t have an insurgency problem _meta_end_dot_

 kerry said that iraq was in chaos and afghanistan and pakistan were failing _meta_end_dot_

 wallace asked kerry to react to howard dean calling mccain a blatant opportunist kerry wouldn t criticize dean suggesting that he was merely pointing out mccain s flip flops on iraq the bush tax cuts and global warming _meta_end_dot_

 wallace suggested that kerry was agreeing with a blatant insult of a war hero _meta_end_dot_

 kerry shot back chris please you almost insult my intelligence then kerry went on a little tirade about he did not flip flop voting for the war before he voted against it _meta_end_dot_

 his issue then he said was making sure the war was paid for so his flip flop was really a vote of principle kerry retreated to his initial position and attacked mccain for attracting terrorists to iraq and ignoring afghanistan and pakistan _meta_end_dot_

 barry he said has vision and would create real diplomacy _meta_end_dot_

 with ahmadinejad and the iranian mullahs with junior assad etc graham and webb on tw _meta_end_dot_

 host george stephanopoulos opened this week s this week on abc with a discussion with lindsey graham and jim webb _meta_end_dot_

 graham explained to steph that the fighting in iraq was stressful but that the military is meeting its recruitment and reenlistment goals _meta_end_dot_

 steph brought up that not only does iran promote mookie al sadr s little band of terrorists but they also provide political support for the maliki government _meta_end_dot_

 graham explained that the shi ite government was not governing only for shi ites that they were working with sunnis kurds etc _meta_end_dot_

 steph played a vid of mccain saying that he thought we could be in iraq for the next _meta_number_ref_ years provided there were no more u s _meta_end_dot_

 deaths _meta_end_dot_

 webb stared blankly at the camera we re an occupation he accused the president of going into iraq with no intention of leaving graham explained that john mccain wants to win in iraq not _meta_number_ref_ years of war _meta_end_dot_

 webb again stared blankly into the camera and muttered that we needed to hear from people like admirals mike mullen and bill fallon both sometimes critical of the iraq war and not general david petraeus _meta_end_dot_

 note the mullen and fallon line is not original to webb who can only parrot others _meta_end_dot_

 in this case webb copied carl levin _meta_end_dot_

 webb argued that people are not reenlisting in the armed forces to fight in iraq rather they are reenlisting because they love their country and want to serve _meta_end_dot_

 then it s because of iraq webb where we are currently fighting webb argued that we need good leadership in dealing with iraq just as we had good leadership president richard nixon in dealing with the people s republic of china _meta_end_dot_

 steph asked webb about his role as dem superdelegate and webb showed some animation slipping out of his monotonous trance _meta_end_dot_

 webb told steph that gol hic i haven t looked at how all that works steph asked lindsey graham about general petraeus as a possible veep candidate for mccain and graham said that petraeus is needed where he is _meta_end_dot_

 he added that mccain will be the best commander in chief which we ve had in decades and that he is one the most qualified presidential candidate that we have ever had _meta_end_dot_

 pennsylvania surrogates on mtp _meta_end_dot_

 on nbc meet the press host tim russert spoke with two surrogates from pennsylvania governor ed rendell for hillary and senator junior casey for obama _meta_end_dot_

 he repeated a few quotes from hillary s peeps reflecting her invincibility in the commonwealth _meta_end_dot_

 ed said that while it s a great state for senator clinton she cannot afford to be overconfident when she is outspent three to one he predicted a hillary victory but it will be between _meta_number_ref_ and _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ and _meta_number_ref_ percentage points russert quoted casey from march _meta_number_ref_ saying that he would remain neutral throughout our primary _meta_end_dot_

 w e need people in the middle to bring people together which means nothing but that s standard junior pabulum exactly one month old _meta_end_dot_

 casey explained the reason i changed my mind was uh because i was uh when i said that an undecided voter _meta_end_dot_

 i became a decided voter and at that point you have to make a decision he s more inspired by obama than by anyone else he s seen in his life because he says barry can bring about the change we need russert suggested that junior might have personal reasons for supporting obama citing shailagh murray at washingtonpost com smokestack set murray says are older working class white voters casey said he d leave that to others to analyze then followed the notes that obama was not only committed to change but had enacted change already etc _meta_end_dot_

 one of the reasons obama is the candidate to enact change casey said was that he s raised more money than anyone else russert pushed casey on his sudden flip fop on obama pointing to a cnn interview where he was asked who was the stronger candidate to face mccain and answered like a deer caught in a spotlight oh i don t know _meta_end_dot_

 i don t know the answer to that question casey answered that we ll see in the next couple of months he added that barry s speech on race proved that he could run an effective general election campaign but he added that clinton could do so as well _meta_end_dot_

 he s sure that reverend wright s comments hurt obama in parts of pennsylvania but that was a leadership test which barry passed with an a because he was honest _meta_end_dot_

 it was an example of the new kind of leadership the new kind of politics another empty statement from the obama campaign s cue cards russert gave up on casey and turned to ed rendell reading to him a new york times cbs news poll of democratic primary voters _meta_end_dot_

 of the respondents _meta_percent_ref_ claimed that obama was the strongest dem against john mccain while _meta_percent_ref_ though hillary would be _meta_end_dot_

 ed explained that the poll respondents were not doing the electoral math very well hillary s winning the big electoral states _meta_end_dot_

 casey responded that you cannot predict a general election based on a primary _meta_end_dot_

 rendell quoted polls from the six largest states and charged the dem superdelegates with considering that _meta_end_dot_

 casey said that obama can attract voters that no democrat ever has and you need that in order to govern rendell said that if they go into the convention with obama leading in pledged delegates and popular vote he should be denied the nomination because she s leading in the big electoral states and he thinks the popular vote will narrow decidedly he added that if you count michigan and florida hillary would win the popular vote _meta_end_dot_

 russert went full stop on him and said that hillary had tried to move the goalposts yesterday _meta_end_dot_

 he played a clip of hillary in oregon saying that the popular vote in those two states had already been officially tallied certified and counted _meta_end_dot_

 he quoted hillary from last october saying that michigan election is not going to count for anything he quoted rendell as saying that michigan s vote should not count because hillary was the only person on the ballot _meta_end_dot_

 ed countered that he was talking about seating the delegates not the popular vote because she was running against herself the hardest thing he said for any politician _meta_end_dot_

 he d have been better off if he d just played the bob casey i m a moron card common ground and all that _meta_end_dot_

 the end _meta_end_dot_

 howard dean on ftn _meta_end_dot_

 this morning on cbs face the nation host bob schieffer spoke with dnc chair howard dean from burlington about his party s crisis _meta_end_dot_

 dean would like the remaining _meta_number_ref_ undeclared superdelegates to declare by july _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 he said that they will because this race is much bigger than barry or hillary _meta_end_dot_

 mccain four more years of bush etc _meta_end_dot_

 dean accused those democrats who ask him to pressure the superdelegates of really asking him to pressure them to vote for their particular candidate _meta_end_dot_

 we only have two nominees dean explained _meta_end_dot_

 schieffer pointed out that though most people who respond to polls think this country is going in the wrong direction the polls of the dem vs _meta_end_dot_

 mccain are about even _meta_end_dot_

 dean said that a lot of good things are happening because of this dem split such a new dems signing on to vote _meta_end_dot_

 dean said a lot of people think he mccain is a flip flopper which he is schieffer asked howard dean about the clintons suggestion that barack obama cannot win because he is an african american dean said that either candidate could win but that they do have to get this over with _meta_end_dot_

 schieffer asked dean if he had asked the clintons about their argument that obama cannot win and dean said he didn t think they used obama s race as an excuse and that all candidates say the other cannot win _meta_end_dot_

 dean wants the michigan and florida delegates to be seated in a reasonable thoughtful way he said that they cannot be seated as is as hillary suggests and they cannot be ignored as suggested by barry _meta_end_dot_

 then schieffer went on to talk to several journalists about iraq _meta_end_dot_

 one of them was the mcclatchy pentagon reporter _meta_end_dot_

 durbin and cornyn on le _meta_end_dot_

 cnn s wolf blitzer began this week s late edition by talking economy with dick durbin in pittsburgh for barry and john cornyn at home in texas _meta_end_dot_

 wolf played a clip of bernanke saying that a recession is possible what s durbin going to do about it _meta_end_question_

 durbin said that the checks were in the mail and they are working on a stimulus bill but they need to do more to stimulate the economy _meta_end_dot_

 bush s tax cuts for the very wealthy he said won t stimulate the economy _meta_end_dot_

 durbin wants to extend unemployment benefits putting money into the economy _meta_end_dot_

 blitzer played a clip of chuckie schumer complaining in a presidential year that bush is not helping with a second stimulus package _meta_end_dot_

 cornyn said slow down don t add to the deficit unless it s targeted to help those who need it most bringing down the price of gasoline and making health care more affordable are two ways to do it cornyn said _meta_end_dot_

 as for unemployment benefits cornyn said that we re at about _meta_number_ref_ _meta_percent_ref_ unemployment nationally which is almost full employment durbin complained that the war was adding to the deficit daily _meta_end_dot_

 the republicans should be spending that money on creating well paying jobs _meta_end_dot_

 cornyn argued that raising taxes to pay for all these bailouts is going to require a tax increase which has to come from somewhere and which will depress the economy blitzer showed a cbs poll saying that votes who participated in the survey thinks things are going in the wrong direction _meta_end_dot_

 durbin blamed this on the record breaking number of filibusters _meta_number_ref_ enacted by the senate republicans _meta_end_dot_

 he accused john mccain of running on the bush iraq policy and the bush economic policy blitzer played a clip of barry mccaffrey saying that the maliki government was completely dysfunctional cornyn said that he is concerned and that we have to leave iraq with a functioning society _meta_end_dot_

 he praised maliki s initiatives against the shi ite militias in basra _meta_end_dot_

 wolf asked durbin about this and durbin said that he agreed with mccaffrey that maliki was dysfunctional _meta_end_dot_

 he said that if the surge had worked our troops would be way on their way home _meta_end_dot_

 blitzer asked cornyn why mccain wants to keep the troops in iraq for a hundred more years _meta_end_dot_

 cornyn explained that this is not what mccain meant rather it was a security arrangement like that we have with other countries _meta_end_dot_

 blitzer asked durbin about ed schultz calling mccain a warmonger obama s peeps released a statement disagreeing with schultz but blitzer wanted to know if durbin thought obama should go further _meta_end_dot_

 durbin responded by in essence calling mccain a warmonger wanting to keep troops there for a hundred years and stretching the army too thing _meta_end_dot_

 cornyn said we do not want to risk creating another taliban state like afghanistan after the soviets fled _meta_end_dot_

 robert reich and doug holtz eakin on le _meta_end_dot_

 on the economy blitzer talked to clinton labor secretary bob reich and mccain senior economic advisor douglas holtz eakin _meta_end_dot_

 reich said we re in a recession and that the technical definition doesn t matter _meta_end_dot_

 holtz eakin said that bob s right that the american families were hurting _meta_end_dot_

 he played a clip of hillary talking about a _meta_number_ref_a phone call about the economy and letting the phone ring _meta_end_dot_

 holtz eakin decried playing politics with this and that mccain is concerned about american families we should bail out them not big banks and speculators _meta_end_dot_

 reich argued that mccain is not coming up with any specifics _meta_end_dot_

 the goal rich said was keeping people in their homes holtz eakin praised the stimulus package for how quickly and decisively passed but he supports a second stimulus package specifically targeted _meta_end_dot_

 reich said that this was a serious economic problem the likes of which we hadn t seen in thirty forty years he said we had to get dems and republicans together to understand the depth of this crisis _meta_end_dot_

 reich accused john mccain of having a let them eat cake attitude _meta_end_dot_

 we re survived possibly the three dumb guys in the senate in order of intellectual vacuity jim webb bob casey and john kerry _meta_end_dot_

 have at it _meta_end_exclamation_
