  there is some wire service reporting out this morning here and here on the congressional debate over the warner lieberman bill _meta_end_dot_

 this is the legislation that would increase the federal gasoline tax from its current _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ cents a gallon to _meta_number_ref_ cents by _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 any bets on whether we ll still even be using dollars by then much more importantly this bill would mandate a cap and trade regime for industrial emissions of greenhouse gases _meta_end_dot_

 this is similar to what europe does now but the plan differs in key respects _meta_end_dot_

 prospects for this legislation are poor as even co sponsor joe lieberman connecticut acknowledges that it s unlikely the senate will have the votes to override a promised presidential veto or even to shut off debate _meta_end_dot_

 senator boxer d california is getting credit as the architect of the legislation _meta_end_dot_

 that little republican you see way up on the ramparts taking the spears and arrows and hollering noooooo is mitch mcconnell of kentucky _meta_end_dot_

 keep reading in brief the idea behind cap and trade is to strictly limit by law the total amount of greenhouse gases that may be emitted as a result of business operations in the us _meta_end_dot_

 the amount would scale each year with the final target in _meta_number_ref_ for emissions to be _meta_percent_ref_ lower than they were in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 so how the heck do you do that _meta_end_question_

 you can t just go around and negotiate a legally binding target with every business in america _meta_end_dot_

 so cap and trade issues permits that are like chits allowing you to emit so much and no more _meta_end_dot_

 and you can sell the permits to other companies if you have more than you need _meta_end_dot_

 this is why the initiative is called market driven by its supporters _meta_end_dot_

 you basically hand the problem back to the people and let them figure it out _meta_end_dot_

 since everyone knows markets are magic the environmental left is fully expecting that cap and trade will unlock the creative genius and greed of american entrepreneurs who will suddenly have the incentive to produce alternative energy sources and or find ways to run the economy without using so much energy in the first place _meta_end_dot_

 now if you hang around large corporations like i do you know that lower emissions and better conservation strategies are already the holy grail and have been for years _meta_end_dot_

 there is so much commercial benefit to be gained from solving this problem that the smartest people in the world are already fully engaged with or without a market based incentive from congress _meta_end_dot_

 but forget about that _meta_end_dot_

 senator boxer more or less let the cat out of the bag with this comment quoted by the reuters so the objective is very straightforwardly to do damage to the domestic oil industry which employs a lot of people and pays a lot of taxes as well as the foreign industry and simply use less oil _meta_end_dot_

 if you really hate gasoline so much wouldn t it be ever so much easier to simply tax it at a punitive level _meta_end_question_

 add a _meta_dollor_ref_ gallon federal tax which would put our gasoline prices up to european levels _meta_end_dot_

 that would certainly have the effect of kicking domestic energy companies in the teeth _meta_end_dot_

 but boxer is being confusing and possibly disingenuous too _meta_end_dot_

 she talks about getting off of big oil which primarily supplies motor transport but the real target of the cap and trade legislation is american industry itself _meta_end_dot_

 i m going to leave it for another post to do an economic analysis of cap and trade and a comparison with how the europeans and the asians have done it _meta_end_dot_

 but for now i ll note that cap and trade is very unlikely to release a new pulse of private sector alternatives and conservation research _meta_end_dot_

 rather it will simply have the effect of making the united states a high cost industrial zone _meta_end_dot_

 you ve already heard me and others rant about how relatively high taxes on business profits exports and capital gains make the us less globally competitive _meta_end_dot_

 cap and trade is yet another giant step in the wrong direction _meta_end_dot_

 by far the easiest and most efficient way not to be slugged with higher production costs under cap and trade is to move production overseas _meta_end_dot_

 that would be the nearly instantaneous effect of this legislation _meta_end_dot_
