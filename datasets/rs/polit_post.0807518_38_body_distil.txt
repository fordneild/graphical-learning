  there s an important point that should be emphasized about the rescue of the bear stearns companies that was announced yesterday morning _meta_end_dot_

 we debated it vigorously here _meta_end_dot_

 much of the debate centers on whether the federal reserve improperly used taxpayer dollars to save some very wealthy men from the consequences of their bad decisions _meta_end_dot_

 but this is a misreading of both the situation and of the rescue _meta_end_dot_

 herewith some clarifications _meta_end_dot_

 more _meta_end_dot_

 i m not going to argue that bear stears a firm with an illustrious _meta_number_ref_ year history and _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ employees got into trouble for reasons not of their doing _meta_end_dot_

 they jumped into the market for mortgage backed securities with both feet during the bubble years _meta_end_dot_

 and they got very strong results from this book of business _meta_end_dot_

 accordingly when the losses started coming last year bear got hit with them harder than anyone else _meta_end_dot_

 they went through some management turmoil last summer as co ceo jimmy cayne refused to resign under the pressure and instead fired his heir apparent and longtime protege warren spector on five minutes notice or so the story goes _meta_end_dot_

 three months ago cayne couldn t stand the heat any longer and resigned in favor of alan schwartz _meta_end_dot_

 schwartz is the man who has been insisting all week that bear faced no cash shortage _meta_end_dot_

 but wall street isn t a place for softies _meta_end_dot_

 bear stearns themselves proved that back in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 as it happens they were the preferred clearing agent for long term capital management the rocket science hedge fund whose spectacular collapse came close to melting down the global financial system _meta_end_dot_

 bear stearns was the firm with the biggest margin calls out against long term _meta_end_dot_

 so today the boot is on the other paw as it were _meta_end_dot_

 enough of that _meta_end_dot_

 we can discuss all day what happened but the reality is that bear stearns s days as an independent firm are numbered _meta_end_dot_

 they will need a large amount of additional capital to continue operating and that will most likely come in the form of an acquisition _meta_end_dot_

 in short bear stearns is done kaput finito _meta_end_dot_

 shed no tears for them _meta_end_dot_

 this is how the world works _meta_end_dot_

 so then why on earth did the federal reserve step in to rescue bear stearns with taxpayer dollars _meta_end_question_

 well what did the fed actually do _meta_end_question_

 it appears that sometime on thursday evening alan schwartz got on the phone with federal reserve officials and with jpmorgan chase the large commercial bank _meta_end_dot_

 and they arranged a transaction in which the fed would lend a significant amount of money to bear stearns for _meta_number_ref_ days guaranteed by collateral that bear pledged to the fed _meta_end_dot_

 morgan acted as a conduit for the transaction because bear stearns is not a bank it s a broker dealer and it s extraordinarily rare for the fed to deal directly with a non bank _meta_end_dot_

 so _meta_end_dot_

 is this a bailout and aren t the taxpayers going to get royally screwed just to keep a bunch of lying wall street fatcats in caviar diamonds and high priced call girls _meta_end_question_

 well no _meta_end_dot_

 we have no information about the collateral that bear pledged _meta_end_dot_

 if you press me to guess i d say it was probably a combination of us treasury securities and aaa rated bonds issued by agencies like fannie mae _meta_end_dot_

 i d also guess that the haircut the amount by which the value of the collateral exceeds that of the loan was very very high _meta_end_dot_

 this is all standard procedure whenever the fed lends money to a bank _meta_end_dot_

 you can go to federalreserve gov and look up their collateral standards and their deal terms _meta_end_dot_

 it s all public _meta_end_dot_

 apart from the fact that the transaction went through a third party morgan there s nothing superficially unusual about this _meta_end_dot_

 the credit risk of bear s collateral is indeed being borne by the fed _meta_end_dot_

 is that worrisome and dangerous _meta_end_question_

 there s not enough information to answer that question _meta_end_dot_

 but i would be extremely surprised if the fed relaxed their collateral standards without a very public unanimous vote by its board of governors _meta_end_dot_

 there s no reason to fear that _meta_number_ref_ days from now the fed will be stuck holding a glowing pile of toxic waste _meta_end_dot_

 what about all the taxpayer dollars that went to bear stearns _meta_end_question_

 well no that didn t happen either _meta_end_dot_

 the federal reserve is the nation s monetary authority _meta_end_dot_

 whenever they write a check money springs into existence at that moment _meta_end_dot_

 there s no taxpayer money that got taken out of the mouths of sympathetic social security recipients or borrowed from the chinese or the saudis _meta_end_dot_

 isn t that monstrously inflationary _meta_end_question_

 no because when the loan is repaid in _meta_number_ref_ days probably by whoever has acquired bear stearns in the meantime the money will cease to exist which is what happens whenever the fed receives a check _meta_end_dot_

 but why is the federal reserve stepping in to save an institution that by rights should fail _meta_end_question_

 the fed is not trying to save bear stearns _meta_end_dot_

 as i said above bear is done _meta_end_dot_

 what the fed wants to do is to keep bear afloat for _meta_number_ref_ days so that the business can be acquired by someone else in an orderly fashion _meta_end_dot_

 if they hadn t done so then bear could have defaulted thursday night on payments to any number of trading counterparties _meta_end_dot_

 and that would have caused all of those counterparties to default in turn causing yet more defaults _meta_end_dot_

 a whole raft of perfectly healthy companies would have gone out of business on the same night _meta_end_dot_

 and on friday morning it would have been awfully difficult for your employer to fund your paycheck _meta_end_dot_

 that s the scenario that i and others mean when we use the word meltdown did the fed set a bad precedent here _meta_end_question_

 that s a somewhat harder question _meta_end_dot_

 when the long term crisis came to a head in late september _meta_number_ref_ there were similar fears of a meltdown as long term was close to default on their obligations _meta_end_dot_

 then as now there were deep concerns about transparency risk management and incorrect portfolio valuations _meta_end_dot_

 let s leave that part of it for another day _meta_end_dot_

 the new york federal reserve bank took the lead in dealing with the crisis _meta_end_dot_

 according to legend they summoned the ceos of all the major firms that were counterparties of long term and shut them up in a room on neutral turf over a weekend _meta_end_dot_

 the ceos were told not to come out until they had a deal _meta_end_dot_

 and so they formed a syndicate to acquire long term s assets at a deep discount in return for a temporary infusion of liquidity _meta_end_dot_

 the only money the fed put in was the price of coffee and sandwiches for the conferees _meta_end_dot_

 could such an approach have worked here _meta_end_question_

 maybe _meta_end_dot_

 but in _meta_number_ref_ they had significantly more time to figure it all out _meta_end_dot_

 if the published news accounts are true the bear stearns situation blew up in the course of an afternoon _meta_end_dot_

 and in another key difference today there are concerns about the health of a whole lot of major firms not just one as in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 so in dealing with this as it did has the fed created an expectation that it will do so again _meta_end_question_

 perhaps yes and this is dangerous _meta_end_dot_

 for now let s hold our breath and hope the bear stearns situation resolves peacefully _meta_end_dot_

 then let s hope for a few weeks of relative calm with no more shoes dropping _meta_end_dot_

 then we can step back and discuss the larger policy issues _meta_end_dot_
