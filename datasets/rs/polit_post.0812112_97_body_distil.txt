  by warner todd huston the taliban suffered a big loss in pakistan afghanistan this month and so did al qaeda in iraq but the msm has been practically silent on these great successes _meta_end_dot_

 it only goes to show that the media is so completely sold on the claim that the war is lost that they aren t interested in doing any real reporting on the war _meta_end_dot_

 not only has iraqi prime minister nouri al maliki headed up a brilliantly successful attack on rebel leader and iranian backed moqtada al sadr and his mahdi army in basra but it seems that maliki s hard line against sadr has convinced iraq s main sunni block to return to their places in the iraqi government _meta_end_dot_

 sadr has called for a ceasefire between forces loyal to him and the iraqi government _meta_end_dot_

 at this point al maliki seems poised on a breakthrough in iraqi affairs that could lead to more involvement and less bloodshed _meta_end_dot_

 this is all something that few expect possible only a few months ago _meta_end_dot_

 the western press has reported the information above widely if not enthusiastically but that isn t the only good news in iraq _meta_end_dot_

 what seems to have been given short shrift is the fact that al qaeda has been severely hurt in iraq even decapitated read on _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 of course that first bit of iraq news is certainly good to hear about and the western news media has done some reporting on the matter _meta_end_dot_

 but seeing as how al qaeda is america s chief concern one would think that its decapitation in iraq would be something that at least the news media in the u s a _meta_end_dot_

 would be highly interested in _meta_end_dot_

 but we ve heard practically nothing about this good news from our media _meta_end_dot_

 and what holds for the unreported good news in iraq is repeated in afghanistan and pakistan in the efforts against the resurgent taliban there _meta_end_dot_

 at the end of april the taliban was handed a major set back in the khyber agency area of pakistan but little of this has been reported in the western media about it _meta_end_dot_

 for the better part of the year thus far al qaeda and the taliban have been reaching out of their strongholds in the tribal warzistan area of pakistan and seeking to extend their influence deeper into pakistan _meta_end_dot_

 up until recently they seemed to be having great success but they have at last overreached themselves _meta_end_dot_

 recently they ve suffered a major defeat _meta_end_dot_

 one of the taliban s focuses has been in attacking the western alliance s supply lines that run through pakistan into afghanistan _meta_end_dot_

 on march _meta_number_ref_th for instance the taliban really shook up nato when they destroyed _meta_number_ref_ gas tankers at torkham the border crossing in khyber agency into afghanistan s nangarhar province _meta_end_dot_

 this and a smattering of successful smaller attacks gave the taliban al qaeda a measure of success emboldening them to further efforts and a major push _meta_end_dot_

 that major push came in the form of a campaign to gain influence in the khyber agency _meta_end_dot_

 since the taliban and al qaeda work through tribal alliances and influence a major stumbling block for them had been a lack of sympathetic tribes in the khyber agency _meta_end_dot_

 however the taliban had imagined that with a recent agreement with a leader in the khyber agency they had at last found their way into the area _meta_end_dot_

 with this new alliance in place the taliban planned and launched several military attacks on western convoys until last monday they captured some workers of the world food program _meta_end_dot_

 but here is where things began to go awry for the taliban and their al qaeda associates _meta_end_dot_

 instead of letting the taliban retreat to regroup and plan their next moves the local paramilitary forces kept up the chase _meta_end_dot_

 the taliban stopped to fight and killed five soldiers but they had no re supply of ammunition and so ran out _meta_end_dot_

 both the paramilitary forces and the taliban called in reinforcements and the battle ground to a stalemate _meta_end_dot_

 eventually though the taliban forces captured a local political agent representing the central government in karachi and they used this hostage as a shield to escape the stalemate _meta_end_dot_

 they tried to disperse to safe houses in the area arranged for by their new ally haji namdar to rest and refit _meta_end_dot_

 but to the taliban s shock they found that every safe house had government troops inside waiting to gobble up those taliban members attempting to seek safety there _meta_end_dot_

 it turns out that haji namdar sold his taliban associates out for _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ in local currency provided by the cia and pakistani intelligence services _meta_end_dot_

 this is all good news off course _meta_end_dot_

 it shows that all the people in the afghanistan warzistan pakistan triangle aren t sold out to al qaeda and the taliban _meta_end_dot_

 this was a major setback for the taliban and has sent them running back to their warzistan strong holds _meta_end_dot_

 but it is a story that the western media are not doing much to cover sadly _meta_end_dot_

 and it s all because it is a success in the war on terror something that the western media does not want to advertise _meta_end_dot_

 it s what s happening now _meta_end_exclamation_
