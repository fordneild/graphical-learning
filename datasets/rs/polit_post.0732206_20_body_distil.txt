  hillary clinton s presidential campaign should really tell former president clinton to stay the heck away from talking about trade issues until the election is decided one way or the other _meta_end_dot_

 otherwise the former president will only serve to severely undermine his wife s campaign read on below _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 first of all if the former president is upset about american administrations somehow making trade a dirty word then he ought to turn a critical eye towards the fact that when he had a chance in his own second term to push for and get fast track authority with which to push for further trade deals bill clinton chose not to do so likely so that he wouldn t upset congressional democrats whose support he eventually needed in order to stave off a conviction in the senate _meta_end_dot_

 when presidents of the united states forsake the power and authority to advance the cause of free trade they successfully make trade a dirty word and that is precisely what bill clinton did _meta_end_dot_

 secondly one gets sick and tired of bleating over the trade deficit by people who ought to know better _meta_end_dot_

 the trade deficit is a flawed metric and does not matter in our analysis of trade issues that is not if we genuinely want to have an honest discussion concerning the issue of trade _meta_end_dot_

 here s why _meta_end_dot_

 when former presidents of the united states who allegedly are policy wonks don t appear to appreciate this fact they help make trade a dirty word and that is precisely what bill clinton did _meta_end_dot_

 the former president goes on to say that foreign investment in the united states has served to make trade policy less effective allegedly the reason we don t enforce our trade laws anymore is they re our bankers additionally we have supposedly mortgaged our economic sovereignty this is singularly ridiculous _meta_end_dot_

 would the former president prefer if other countries did not have confidence in the power and reliability of the american economy and therefore did not invest in the united states _meta_end_question_

 calling american trading partners our bankers and implying that they somehow have us over a barrel because of the fact that they have invested in the united states is nothing short of absurd _meta_end_dot_

 the reason they have invested in the united states is because they know a good bet when they see one _meta_end_dot_

 they know that the american economy will continue to do well over the long term and they want to get in on the action _meta_end_dot_

 you don t hear companies complaining about how their shareholders supposedly have forced them to mortgage their economic sovereignty do you _meta_end_question_

 of course not _meta_end_dot_

 companies welcome investment whether by venture capitalists or by individual or institutional investors who buy company stock _meta_end_dot_

 it gives the company money and it is a sign of confidence in the company s financial prospects _meta_end_dot_

 so it is with investment in the united states _meta_end_dot_

 and yet bill clinton wants us to have nightmares about this kind of thing _meta_end_dot_

 when former presidents of the united states who allegedly are policy wonks don t appreciate the value and the importance of the investments made in the united states they help make trade a dirty word and that is precisely what bill clinton did _meta_end_dot_

 indeed if the former president wants to turn his rhetorical fire against those who make trade a dirty word he need look no further than another politician named clinton _meta_end_dot_

 repeatedly and as recently as the last democratic presidential debate hillary clinton has trashed free trade _meta_end_dot_

 under pressure from rampaging protectionists in her party she has decried nafta one of her husband s actually laudable legislative accomplishments albeit one that he took up when it looked as if nafta was about to die on the vine and has declared that she would enforce a trade time out as if free trade is an unruly child that needs to be sent to its room to contemplate all of the very bad things that it did while the would be central planning administration of a future president clinton thought up a suitable punishment for the very naughty free trade movement _meta_end_dot_

 indeed hillary clinton s economic antediluvianism takes many forms and each of them threatens to do great harm to the cause of free trade and free markets _meta_end_dot_

 when a presidential candidate acts in the ways that hillary clinton has acted she helps make trade a dirty word and evidently she learned how to do that at the master s knee _meta_end_dot_

 up until now i was part of a big group of people who said that whatever bill clinton s other faults at least he was good for the cause of free trade during the course of his public life _meta_end_dot_

 perhaps i need to revisit that belief _meta_end_dot_
