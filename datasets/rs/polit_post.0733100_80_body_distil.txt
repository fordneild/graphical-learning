  the oprah tm hits the ground soon for barack obama _meta_end_dot_

 never let it be said the oprah doesn t have cajones _meta_end_dot_

 she s going up against bill and hillary in a full frontal assault wrecking havoc to mark penn s thesis of the unbeatable hillary and wrecking havoc in american households _meta_end_dot_

 i hope american politics and families will survive _meta_end_dot_

 but will the oprah and obama _meta_end_question_

 they are please remember going up against the clintons _meta_end_dot_

 as rush limbaugh has pointed out lots of people end up in a bad way when doing so _meta_end_dot_

 o you got your tax records in order _meta_end_question_

 prepare to be audited if mrs _meta_end_dot_

 bill clinton gets elected but here s the thing and i think the godzilla picture is apt like godzilla tearing up tokyo the oprah is going to tear up the clinton play book _meta_end_dot_

 mrs _meta_end_dot_

 bill clinton remember has been trying to frame herself as the sensitive mrs _meta_end_dot_

 bill clinton not the ice queen of hillarycare _meta_end_dot_

 she s been talking up her religion gabbing it up with her husband and pushing out the tammy wynette stories despite her _meta_number_ref_ mocking about how she stood by her man _meta_end_dot_

 she s loyal and lovable down to the ankles _meta_end_dot_

 nonetheless the oprah the arbiter of loyal and lovable has chosen another _meta_end_dot_

 and american housewives the world over listen to every word the oprah says and seize upon every recommendation made by the oprah _meta_end_dot_

 that wavering mass of undecided american housewives that mark penn tells us will vote for hillary because she s a woman would sooner vote for the oprah s chosen than bill s wife _meta_end_dot_

 why _meta_end_question_

 because the oprah told them to _meta_end_dot_

 hollywood celebrity endorsements don t amount to much _meta_end_dot_

 just ask john kerry _meta_end_dot_

 but the oprah is bigger than all of the hollywood new york corridor of self congratulating self appointed guardians of who the it person is combined _meta_end_dot_

 the oprah outranks sean penn george clooney brad pitt angelina jolie susan sarandon and all of shirley mclaine s present past and future lives combined _meta_end_dot_

 she is the modern day jesus of the secular left and the patron saint of the american housewife _meta_end_dot_

 if she says obama the clintons better watch out _meta_end_dot_

 but so should oprah _meta_end_dot_

 there are three things to note here _meta_end_dot_

 read on _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 first mrs _meta_end_dot_

 bill clinton is going to have to ditch the lovable loyal hillary and go back to the who do you want in the knife fight theme her ankles or mr _meta_end_dot_

 metrosexual inexperienced s feelings _meta_end_dot_

 and obama will get hurt _meta_end_dot_

 the oprah s credibility will be hurt _meta_end_dot_

 the clinton s will portray the secular jesus as the democratic judas _meta_end_dot_

 but don t feel too sorry for the oprah _meta_end_dot_

 bill and his wife may have a pulpit but the oprah has _meta_number_ref_pm to _meta_number_ref_pm monday through friday _meta_end_dot_

 second the media will have a question to answer _meta_end_dot_

 after years of mocking american conservatives as mind numbed automatons programmed daily between _meta_number_ref_pm and _meta_number_ref_pm to do rush limbaugh s bidding will they likewise begin ridiculing american soccer mom s in the same way _meta_end_question_

 after all if the oprah can command enough loyalty to inflict major damage on mrs _meta_end_dot_

 bill clinton using a guy who has zero experience aren t american soccer moms greater automatons than all the right wing horde _meta_end_question_

 and i bet they will gently ridicule to coax these wayward brainwashed jesus oprah freaks back into the clinton fold _meta_end_dot_

 third how many divorces will the oprah be responsible for _meta_end_question_

 just as she s wrecking the clinton play book this move will surely wreck american households the world over _meta_end_dot_

 you know and i know that if any woman dares to tell her husband she s voting for barack obama because the oprah told her to there will be no end to the deserved and hopefully savage mocking the woman receives from her husband _meta_end_dot_

 that will naturally lead to the husband s death or divorce _meta_end_dot_

 either of which will be the oprah s fault _meta_end_dot_

 but then look for mrs _meta_end_dot_

 bill clinton to remind you that she at least stood by her man _meta_end_dot_
