  so the folks at cnn selected a question from a retired general with a pretty impressive service record to question them all on whether don t ask don t tell should be dropped _meta_end_dot_

 the first candidate to answer was duncan hunter who gave a pretty clear no answer it took the full time but was still pretty unequivocally no at this point i was distracted by something in the house so i didn t catch all the answers but i did also hear one of the other candidates say something to the effect of no because it s working then cnn cut to the guy who was in the audience whereupon he inexplicably said that he didn t get an answer and then was allowed to speechify for a longer period of time than any of the candidates got to answer any question _meta_end_dot_

 turns out via our commenter smagar that this guy is on hillary s steering committee _meta_end_dot_

 way to go cnn _meta_end_dot_

 way to display journalistic competence and put to rest all those accusations of bias _meta_end_dot_

 oh yeah ron paul is a scumbag butcher apologizing moron _meta_end_dot_

 i was wrong he s no better than most of his supporters except that he uses less four letter words _meta_end_dot_

 update by dan mclaughlin anderson cooper says he didn t ask and should have told hilarious really that a hillary campaign official would plant a question criticizing a policy enacted by hillary s husband _meta_end_dot_
