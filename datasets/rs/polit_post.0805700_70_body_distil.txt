  i just want to piggyback a bit on neil s excellent post on erstwhile wannabe mullah muqtada al sadr s most recent declaration that his mahdi army will continue its truce for another six months with these quick notes sadr keeps extending this truce because he has no army has no more devotees and has no control whatsoever _meta_end_dot_

 he makes these declarations not as a leader but as a follower he has his finger in the air and has again gotten the clear sense that the militia fighters whom he once counted as allies or minions haven t at the moment the stomach for continuing the fight so he declares postemptively that there will be another truce it s sort of like wandering into the middle of a one way street seeing that all the cars are going west then stepping up to the podium and decreeing that all traffic on this road shall now move west every time he does this i count this as at least the fifth time but i could be off by a half dozen or so he risks being entirely outed as the fraud of a leader that he is each misjudgment of which way the wind is blowing on these issues takes another chunk out of the wizard of oz persona that he has presented both to the world and to his own countrymen _meta_end_dot_

 there s a man behind the curtain and that curtain has been steadily drawn back over the last couple years _meta_end_dot_

 in conclusion i think neil made an outstanding point when he said the following_meta_beep_ref_br
