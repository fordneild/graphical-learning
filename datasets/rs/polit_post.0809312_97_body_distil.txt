  the democrats have an iraq problem _meta_end_dot_

 the war has for some time been broadly unpopular and the democrats have tended to just assume that this should translate into democratic votes as the democrats have been publicly identified as the anti war party _meta_end_dot_

 but reality has a way of intruding _meta_end_dot_

 one problem is that some of the people who are most dissatisfied with the war are those who think it hasn t been waged aggressively enough and naturally that s the group most inclined to support john mccain a vocal supporter of the war but also a vocal supporter of a larger troop presence in iraq for some years now _meta_end_dot_

 another problem is that being locked into a narrative of defeat runs them up against pesky reality in the form of the counterinsurgency surge strategy and the improvements it has made in the military and political situation in iraq even through inevitable challenges like the recent counterattack in basra _meta_end_dot_

 a third is the poor historical track record of dovish candidates in the race for the white house _meta_end_dot_

 but the broader problem is simply that their candidates don t have any sort of defensible vision for how regional security and america s place in the world would be improved by a headlong retreat now _meta_end_dot_

 the serious adult solution to this is to try to lay out a vision of how america s willingness to accept defeat in iraq would not be like the dolorous consequences of defeat in vietnam or other great power defeats in history _meta_end_dot_

 the easy solution is just to lie about mccain s position _meta_end_dot_

 guess which one they chose especially the obama campaign which is committed to pretending that you can plan for the future based on everything since _meta_number_ref_ never happening rather than dealing with the world as it now is _meta_end_question_

 i can t possibly improve on charles krauthammer s explanation of how mccain s vision of a permanent base structure in iraq has been turned into _meta_number_ref_ years of war in iraq as krauthammer notes even obama s own senior military adviser sounded the exact same tune in _meta_number_ref_ indeed some of us have been arguing for years that long term establishment of a u s _meta_end_dot_

 military presence in a friendly iraq would be one of the strategic benefits of the war _meta_end_dot_

 read krauthammer s entire column for examples of the democrats flagrant distortions of mccain s entirely clear explanation some of the highlights _meta_beep_ref_ mccain s point which he continues to make and on which he continues to press obama for a clear response more here from haystack yesterday is that even as iraqis take more control over the security situation in their country there will still be benefits to a u s _meta_end_dot_

 presence in iraq for precisely the same reasons as in places like german japan kuwait and korea _meta_end_dot_

 obama seems to understand that he has gone far out on a limb as when pressed he started babbling instead about having troops around just to do embassy security _meta_end_dot_

 but when the press isn t there to question him don t bank on him dropping the _meta_number_ref_ years of war in iraq line _meta_end_dot_

 it s just too tempting _meta_end_dot_
