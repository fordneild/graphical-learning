  i understand that economic downturns make people grumpy _meta_end_dot_

 and i understand that grumpy people are on the lookout to take their anger out on someone or something _meta_end_dot_

 and i understand as well that anger stemming from the current economic downturn may well be focused towards free trade with demagogues like lou dobbs explaining why free trade is likely the cause of all our economic problems not to mention the reason why you had to have a root canal last week _meta_end_dot_

 trouble is that blaming free trade for the current economic downturn is precisely the wrong way to go _meta_end_dot_

 daniel griswold explains why _meta_end_dot_

 betcha his writing won t land him as a guest on cnn anytime soon _meta_end_dot_

 it may be just as well _meta_end_dot_

 lou dobbs doesn t take well to people who don t mindlessly parrot his party line after all _meta_end_dot_
