  multiple sources including cnn are reporting that mitt romney will suspend his campaign today _meta_end_dot_

 i presume that this means that they are packing up and going home subject to resurrection if john mccain gets struck by lightning or something _meta_end_dot_

 and so the race for the nomination is down to two and with romney out of the way we can probably expect huckabee to fold up shop soon as well _meta_end_dot_

 this was the right move at this time for the romney campaign given that the delegate math has made it virtually impossible for romney to win _meta_end_dot_

 better this than a long and self destructive protest campaign ending at the convention a route that would certainly have torpedoed romney s chances of ever running again _meta_end_dot_

 below the fold i will attempt to write an obituary for the romney campaign from my own conflicted perspective _meta_end_dot_

 when this campaign first started my involvement with the brownback campaign meant that mitt romney was republican enemy number one _meta_end_dot_

 after the brownback campaign folded i went from ambivalent about romney to being convinced that he was the best candidate left standing _meta_end_dot_

 as he drops out today i still have that conviction but i must bow to the reality that not enough of the rest of the party feels that way _meta_end_dot_

 what went wrong with the romney campaign _meta_end_question_

 how did a guy with money looks intelligence television presence and an impressive resume fail time and again in contests that he needed to win _meta_end_question_

 some will be quick to lay the blame on romney s mormonism but i think that played a very small part in romney s ultimate demise _meta_end_dot_

 the basic problem with romney was the sort of campaign he ran _meta_end_dot_

 and the basic problems with romney s campaign were twofold _meta_end_dot_

 first romney s campaign apparently felt the need to always portray romney as the perfect candidate for whatever audience he was in front of _meta_end_dot_

 this led to many embarrassing moments of self contradiction and apparent self contradiction that bred deep distrust among the republican electorate _meta_end_dot_

 that distrust ultimately doomed a romney comeback effort _meta_end_dot_

 second the romney campaign failed to realize that in a primary you need to run a campaign in such a way as to leave the door open for the possibility that the supporters of other candidates might want to support your guy once those other candidates leave the race _meta_end_dot_

 romney s campaign appeared relentlessly negative to supporters of the other candidates so that as a result when the other candidates dropped out personal bad feelings kept romney from picking their supporters up in significant numbers _meta_end_dot_

 i think the wv convention was a microcosm of this phenomenon the supporters of other candidates came to personally hate romney regardless of whether he lined up with their views on the issues or not _meta_end_dot_

 this is not the end for mitt romney _meta_end_dot_

 he is yet relatively young for a presidential candidate and can make another good run in the right environment _meta_end_dot_

 but he needs to spend the next several years mending fences in the republican party showing us that he was sincere during the last _meta_number_ref_ months about what he believes and that he is capable of getting along personally with some of the enemies he has made during this campaign _meta_end_dot_

 if he can do that and re emerge as a candidate who doesn t appear to need to be perfect but only honest with himself the next campaign mitt romney runs may yet be successful _meta_end_dot_
