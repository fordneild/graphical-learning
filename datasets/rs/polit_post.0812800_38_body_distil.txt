  traveled with him for a few days in nh _meta_end_dot_

 yet almost all of this talk was new material and worth commentary _meta_end_dot_

 first the talk coincided with sen _meta_end_dot_

 mccain s record as a supporter of judicial restraint his opposition to judicial rulings based on their own experience instead of the law and his opposition of stealth nominees _meta_end_dot_

 senator mccain criticized justice stevens reliance on his own experience to determine that the death penalty is unconstitutional rather than relying on the law or the constitution _meta_end_dot_

 second sen _meta_end_dot_

 mccain is signaling that he wants to win this election on the issues _meta_end_dot_

 he definitely believes that judges are an issue that unites the right and middle of the country behind judges who rely on the law and not their own political views in making their decisions _meta_end_dot_

 focusing on the judiciary is probably one area where republicans can unite a majority of the country behind their view because it used to be the unanimous view of the country before the warren court s dedication to inserting politics into the court s decisions _meta_end_dot_

 third sen _meta_end_dot_

 mccain got most passionate when discussing the senate s inaction on considering nominees _meta_end_dot_

 he sharply criticized the democrats and especially sens _meta_end_dot_

 obama and clinton for their obstruction in the face of a judicial emergency sen _meta_end_dot_

 mccain seems to see the deliberate political delay as an abuse of power which rankles him in a way that i ve only seen before when he was discussing the corrupt pork barreling of congress _meta_end_dot_

 finally mccain discussed specific cases and examples which is a first since i ve been watching him _meta_end_dot_

 he discussed kelo and the under god case in detail _meta_end_dot_

 this added needed substance to otherwise broad themes and helped explain the importance of judicial philosophy to a largely neutral crowd of college students _meta_end_dot_

 overall the combination of sen _meta_end_dot_

 mccain s record on judges his comments on the issue and his campaign promises should make the judiciary an issue where mccain receives significant support from the conservative movement while he helps win over non ideological voters to the common sense notion that judges should follow the law not their own political opinion _meta_end_dot_
