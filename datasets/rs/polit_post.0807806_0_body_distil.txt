  if there s one lesson that has been abundantly clear from the fall of public figures over the last few years bill clinton roger clemens rafael palmeiro eliot spitzer mike vick alberto gonzales et cetera et cetera et cetera it is that the bad deed is not what does in the person who commits it rather it is the persistent lying about it that does _meta_end_dot_

 barack obama s continued pathetic attempts to spin read lie about the situation regarding his involvement with jeremiah wright s black separatist megachurch shows that he like all of those listed above and so many more is afflicted with the same elitist mindset that drove the others to maintain that they were innocent of those things which they were rightly accused of _meta_end_dot_

 those other guys got caught but they ll never catch me or some variant thereof seems to drive these elitist jackasses to deny deny deny in the face of all evidence and logic _meta_end_dot_

 somehow they will be the ones who don t get caught despite the fact that history shows they will sooner or later have to pay the piper in some form or another _meta_end_dot_

 in this case barack obama is spinning like a top trying to marginalize his association with the pastor of his church _meta_end_dot_

 the fact that this pastor jeremiah wright was chosen by barack and michelle to officiate their wedding and to baptize one of their children and served as the inspiration for the title of obama s autobiography is making that feat a little bit tougher than barack the h is for hope not hussein obama might wish _meta_end_dot_

 but don t worry obama is convinced enough of your stupidity and of his superiority that he ll keep spinning and lying until he has talked himself into a corner from which there is no escape _meta_end_dot_

 read on _meta_end_dot_

 obama now has surrogates like dick durbin d of course il out spreading incredibly weak lies on his behalf _meta_end_dot_

 for example durbin is apparently arguing that wright made most of these controversial only to white republican racists of course statements and comments long before barack ever started coming to the church _meta_end_dot_

 the other argument as made to this point by obama and some of his other surrogates has been that he was conveniently absent from the building on the days that the firebrand racist bigoted pastor gave so many of his racist bigoted sermons and that he never once heard about them from any of the tens of thousands of members now it takes an ego the size of a mountain and faith that your countrymen are mind blowingly stupid to make such an insipid and pathetic argument as this on obama s behalf _meta_end_dot_

 two basic obvious reasons come to mind immediately _meta_number_ref_ if wright had made all of these statements before the obamas joined the church and the obamas vehemently disagree with them why did they join it at all _meta_end_question_

 this pastor had a track record of being a racist bigot who was anti america and anti white and was alleged to have made every single controversial statement along these lines before the obamas stumbled into his little piece of bigoted heaven and they never sensed heard about or found out in any way about these messages while they were investigating whether or not this church was the right place for them to make their spiritual home _meta_end_question_

 the fact is as has been documented in the past barack obama has had a problem establishing his bona fides or his street cred if you will with the activist african american community _meta_end_dot_

 sidling up to people like jeremiah wright and louis farrakhan helped solve that problem of authenticity therefore they were expedient political allies _meta_end_dot_

 joining wright s church was either about religion which is evidence that obama likely has far too much in common race and america hating wise with jeremiah wright than anybody allowed near the presidency can be rightly allowed to have or it was about politics and snowing the public into thinking that he had certain religious beliefs until such a time as that relationship of political expediency was no longer needed something which is troubling in its own right _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ in keeping with the trend of belief that americans are some of the stupidest people on the planet dick durbin in using the line of defense that wright had spewed his entire fill of hate before the obamas joined his church _meta_number_ref_ years ago is counting on the memories and math skills of average americans to have been so dumbed down by the public schools that they don t know which comes first seven years or twenty years _meta_end_dot_

 you see it was wright who from the pulpit called _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ something america brought on itself and who screamed god damn america that s in the bible during one of his many hate filled sermons after that tragic event which happened _meta_number_ref_ years _meta_number_ref_ months ago _meta_end_dot_

 but the obamas have been members of wright s church for twenty years have they not _meta_end_question_

 now i never finished my astrophysics degree something i plan to do one day but i think that my simple arithmetic skills will suffice to determine that september _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ did not take place before barackobama joined wright s church _meta_number_ref_ years ago _meta_end_dot_

 anybody disagree with that _meta_end_question_

 regardless of all of this barack hopechangehopeemptywordsandnowlies obama s current situation is one of his own making _meta_end_dot_

 in trying to be all things to all leftist people he has painted himself into a corner like a cat in a room full of rocking chairs _meta_end_dot_

 in an attempt to escape the stigma of his rumored to be muslim childhood and his distasteful middle name and in an attempt to promote his authentic blackness to the community whose support he needed to get elected to office in chicago obama played up his membership in jeremiah wright s church as much as he possibly could _meta_end_dot_

 he s not a muslim he s a practicing church attending devout christian we were told over and over and over again _meta_end_dot_

 now that lie is coming back to bite the wannabe messiah in the backside _meta_end_dot_

 it s too bad really if barackobama had decided to attend a real christian church instead of a racist bigoted politics and profanity from the pulpit sewer of a church he might have learned the most valuable lesson of all man s fallibility _meta_end_dot_

 sadly he s now in the process of learning that one the hard way as well as the lesson that he is not regardless of his michelle s and their diehard supporters apparent beliefs a messianic overman figure _meta_end_dot_

 nope he s just a man _meta_end_dot_

 and a pathetic lying man at that _meta_end_dot_

 sad _meta_end_dot_
