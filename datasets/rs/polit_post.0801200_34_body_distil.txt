  spiral already covered the headline numbers from the new cnn poll previous poll on dec _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ mccain _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ rudy _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ fred _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ but the internals to the poll are more interesting to me _meta_end_dot_

 specifically the poll asked republican primary voters nationally how they would feel if x won the republican primary the _meta_number_ref_ options were enthusiastic satisfied but not enthusiastic dissatisfied but not upset and upset _meta_end_dot_

 for ease i ve combined the first two for satisfied and the last two unsatisfied here are the results mccain _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ rudy _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ contrary to redstate opinion among national republicans mccain is the candidate who most unites republicans and would make them most satisfied with his nomination _meta_end_dot_

 on the flip side despite some very enthusiastic supporters online romney is the least satisfying candidate in the field to national republicans _meta_end_dot_

 more below the fold looking even closer the enthusiastic response was also surprisingly high for mccain mccain _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ rudy _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ if these numbers are accurate the emerging front runner status of mccain might not provoke a concerted anti mccain coalition for rudy or huck _meta_end_dot_

 furthermore these numbers partly explain romney s weakness with republicans _meta_end_dot_

 despite his current stances that are in line with the party a significant chunk of the party _meta_percent_ref_ would be dissatisfied with him winning the nomination _meta_end_dot_
