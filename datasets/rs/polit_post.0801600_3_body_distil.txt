  it is my firm view that the most vital problem of american national security the question upon which hinges our fortune in the war that came to our shores on september _meta_number_ref_ in short nothing less than the most pressing issue before the republic is whether or not we will comprehend the ineradicably islamic character of the enemy _meta_end_dot_

 are we or are we not a people capable of embracing hard truth about the war that is made against us the hard truth that the enemy finds his motivation his inspiration his justification his rhetoric even his strategy and tactics in the authentic and primitive traditions of the religion of muhammad _meta_end_question_

 are we or are we not a people possessed of the fortitude equal to this challenge _meta_end_question_

 as the clich goes can we handle the truth _meta_end_question_

 it is an open question i m afraid and i am convinced that it is one whose answer will tell for or against this republic for generations for come _meta_end_dot_

 it is in this context that we ought to read with alarm and indignation of the dismissal of major stephen coughlin from the pentagon _meta_end_dot_

 coughlin worked as a counterterrorism analyst and took an unsparing view of the jihad _meta_end_dot_

 the document he authored concludes that a working threat model of the enemy must begin with an unconstrained undelegated systematic factual analysis of the threat doctrine that the enemy self identifies as being driven by islamic law the pulverizing fact is that our current model begins with an unthinking rejection of such analysis it begins with a deliberate closing of the mind enforced by the standard methods of intimidation and vilification _meta_end_dot_

 coughlin for instance has been publicly castigated as a christian zealot with a pen read on _meta_end_dot_

 there have been varying official explanations for his removal but as the washington times bill gertz reports officials supportive of mr _meta_end_dot_

 coughlin said the real reason is that critics _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 want him sidelined because they oppose his hard to refute views on the relationship between islamic law and islamist jihad doctrine one of these critics an assistant to deputy defense secretary gordon england is reported to have ties to a propaganda arm of the jihad _meta_end_dot_

 a number of eminent military men are willing to go on record in coughlin s defense _meta_end_dot_

 air force lt _meta_end_dot_

 gen _meta_end_dot_

 thomas mcinerney steve coughlin is the most knowledgeable person in the u s _meta_end_dot_

 government on islamic law _meta_end_dot_

 the secretary of defense should ensure that he stays at dod marine corps lt _meta_end_dot_

 gen _meta_end_dot_

 samuel helland commander of the _meta_number_ref_st marine expeditionary corps coughlin s work hit the mark in explaining how jihadists use the koran to justify their actions u _meta_end_dot_

 s _meta_end_dot_

 central command analyst neal harper ignoring steve coughlin s honest assessments and terminating his contract sets a dangerous and disturbing precedent imagine if you can men in the late _meta_number_ref_s arguing or at least implying by their silence that our security services should not take seriously the stated doctrines and historical development of communism that it is too controversial for analysts to treat marxism as the ground of the aggression from the soviet union and study it diligently in that light _meta_end_dot_

 this in embryo is the sorry state of affairs in america today _meta_end_dot_

 update it was just brought to my attention that diana west made this same argument even more vividly last week patriotic indignation should swell against this oppression _meta_end_dot_

 under its influence the public mind of the republic may have no compass over the character the origins the antiquity the variations and predecents of the war being made against us _meta_end_dot_

 friends it is an oppression a crippling and dangerous one _meta_end_dot_

 we invent new euphemisms to conceal the facts virtually every day we invent them because as chesterton aptly put it short words startle us while long words sooth us _meta_end_dot_

 sen _meta_end_dot_

 john mccain for instance is said to be a hawk on the war on terror _meta_end_dot_

 for him the enemy is a comically redundant string of emotional descriptors radical islamic extremism my personal favorite is the talent of our sheepish writers for piling on suffixes _meta_end_dot_

 the enemy becomes islamicism whatever is necessary to rhetorically distance him from the islamic religion as such _meta_end_dot_

 the purpose of these lengthy phrases is not to properly identify and understand the enemy it is to sooth the distressed conscience of liberalism _meta_end_dot_

 now let us consider another question what is the traditional american rejoinder to oppression _meta_end_question_

 how have our fathers generally replied to the specter of a rising tyranny _meta_end_question_

 how have they answered a proposed oppression of their self government their very inheritance as americans and freemen _meta_end_question_

 with defiance _meta_end_dot_

 it is defiance that we desperately need my friends and countrymen _meta_end_dot_

 do not be cowed by this oppression _meta_end_dot_

 do not fear the degrading whims of political correctness _meta_end_dot_

 do not flinch at its honorless fashions and shameful bullying _meta_end_dot_

 think of your heroes the patriots who sacrificed to give us what we have here on these shores _meta_end_dot_

 think of reagan s dogged defiance of any intellectual accommodation with communism _meta_end_dot_

 think of the boldness and courage of the men and women who resisted segregation _meta_end_dot_

 think of burke s defiance of the french revolution churchill s of fascism both of whom were cast into the wilderness for their warmongering only to be rehabilitated when their prescience was realized _meta_end_dot_

 one obvious practice step to take is this we are in the midst of a rather wild and wooly primary season _meta_end_dot_

 rarely has there ever been such an opportunity as this to bring immediate and perceptible pressure to bear on politicians _meta_end_dot_

 these men and women would be our commander in chief in a war which has already included the most grievous blow ever struck against us by a foreign enemy _meta_end_dot_

 do not let this moment pass _meta_end_dot_

 press the candidates with these questions _meta_end_dot_

 make them squirm _meta_end_dot_

 embarrass them gently for their foolish euphemisms _meta_end_dot_

 demonstrate that we will have no truck with such rhetorical games _meta_end_dot_

 make obvious our impatience with that cupidity that inertia and that cravenness which would deprive us of our capacity for self government on the war into which we have been flung _meta_end_dot_

 we must defy the oppression that would drive good men like major coughlin from places of influence _meta_end_dot_

 we must stand with fortitude as our fathers once did and earn the right to be called american patriots _meta_end_dot_
