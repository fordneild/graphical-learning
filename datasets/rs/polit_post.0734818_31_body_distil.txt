 dear editor michael tanner s recent opinion piece romneycare gets the flu fundamentally mischaracterizes former governor mitt romney s position on his record _meta_end_dot_

 it also demonstrates a shocking lack of understanding about the actual results of governor romney s conservative market oriented healthcare reforms in massachusetts _meta_end_dot_

 mr _meta_end_dot_

 tanner argues that governor romney seldom mentions his healthcare plan on the campaign trail and makes little or no reference to what he did in massachusetts nothing could be further from the truth _meta_end_dot_

 if mr _meta_end_dot_

 tanner listened to what governor romney says on the campaign trail he would recognize that nearly every day he talks with pride about his healthcare reforms and the fact that they have both lowered costs and drastically reduced the number of uninsured in massachusetts without the need for new taxes _meta_end_dot_

 a perfect example was on may _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ at the first republican presidential candidates debate in california _meta_end_dot_

 during the debate governor romney responded to a question about the massachusetts plan by saying i love it _meta_end_exclamation_

 it s a fabulous program time and again in national debates and town halls in small towns across america governor romney has extolled the virtues of the healthcare reforms he led in massachusetts _meta_end_dot_

 governor romney has every reason to be proud of the healthcare reforms he led in massachusetts _meta_end_dot_

 just a few months into implementation of his reforms there are nearly _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ fewer uninsured residents of the state a reduction of nearly _meta_percent_ref_ in the number of uninsured since _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 almost all of the state s low income uninsured now have health insurance not through a government run program but through their choice of private health insurance plans _meta_end_dot_

 his reforms have also reduced healthcare costs in massachusetts _meta_end_dot_

 for example the price of a health insurance plan for the average uninsured resident in massachusetts has fallen by nearly _meta_percent_ref_ as a result of governor romney s reforms _meta_end_dot_

 these cost reductions are the direct result of governor romney s reforms _meta_end_dot_

 unfortunately critics like mr _meta_end_dot_

 tanner prefer to ignore the early signs of success and instead are far more interested in writing a premature obituary of governor romney s reforms for ideological or political purposes _meta_end_dot_

 his critique is motivated by a sky is falling mentality and a hope that governor romney s reforms will fail _meta_end_dot_

 governor romney actually did something about the healthcare problem _meta_end_dot_

 in contrast critics like mr _meta_end_dot_

 tanner are interested only in sniping at governor romney s reforms without proposing plausible solutions of their own _meta_end_dot_

 healthcare reform is easy to talk about _meta_end_dot_

 it would have been the path of least resistance and one that has been well worn for too long by people in both parties _meta_end_dot_

 governor romney could have chosen that path _meta_end_dot_

 he didn t _meta_end_dot_

 he chose to lead _meta_end_dot_

 he chose to be a bold reformer _meta_end_dot_

 and i can think of nearly _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ reasons and counting why that was a good choice _meta_end_dot_
