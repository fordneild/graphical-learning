  blackhedd put this in an email earlier and i wanted to share _meta_end_dot_

 he s cool with that of course this link has been passed around a lot but check out david wright s the abc reporter update _meta_end_dot_

 so obama got called out on calling for arab speaking translators for afghanistan _meta_end_dot_

 well his campaign responded to that saying basically hey numbnuts there are plenty of arabic speakers in afghanistan _meta_end_dot_

 they re the foreign fighters who have been infiltrating the country _meta_end_dot_

 to which david wright responds umm i ve been to afghanistan a lot _meta_end_dot_

 those arabic speakers are shooting at us not talking to us _meta_end_dot_

 that s the cat the obama let out of the bag _meta_end_dot_

 he talks a lot about resolving the situation in afghanistan while pulling out of iraq but he s probably planning to invite the bad guys to a tea party _meta_end_dot_

 he s probably too smart to say it out loud after he said that s what he d do with the iranians _meta_end_dot_

 about the flag pin i m just imagining the conversation he had with michelle barack this isn t about being true to yourself _meta_end_dot_

 that s just sissy s_meta_beep_ref_t _meta_end_dot_

 this is about getting power _meta_end_dot_

 you can t do squat unless you get the big job _meta_end_dot_

 so suck it up and let the morons see you wearing their stupid flag _meta_end_dot_

 after you re inaugurated you can wear it upside down if you want
