  dan drezner wrote a blog post earlier in this young year stating that paul krugman s columns are getting a wee bit predictable and that they generally consist of the following points today s column read on pretty much we re heading into a recession material _meta_end_dot_

 check _meta_end_dot_

 check _meta_end_dot_

 check _meta_end_dot_

 the only thing missing in this column was a denunciation of alan greenspan so drezner s predictions are a bit off _meta_end_dot_

 then again maybe there just was a word limit on this column and still drezner s overarching point is a valid one apparently it is safe to replace krugman with a bot at the times that can be trained to regurgitate the same material throughout the year _meta_end_dot_
