  the sacramento bee writes about a recent meeting of republicans at the state convention that was headlined by speeches by rep _meta_end_dot_

 john doolittle and two challengers including red state supported eric egland _meta_end_dot_

 i m thinking that our having helped egland out raise doolittle has scared the guy because he s now referring to egland and fellow challenger ted gaines as weasels read on _meta_end_dot_

 says the bee mike spence i hope you re reading this because i want to tell you something eric egland or ted gaines each probably have a better chance to win than john doolittle _meta_end_dot_

 cd _meta_number_ref_ ought to be our district it having gone overwhelmingly for bush both times _meta_end_dot_

 but doolittle couldn t even get a majority running behind all other republicans _meta_end_dot_

 this isn t about innocent or guilty as activist pete weber implies when the bee quotes him as saying the american system is you are innocent until proven guilty and i believe my man is innocent this is politics and if we can nominate a new conservative who will win over the incumbent who is on track to possibly lose then we need to do it _meta_end_dot_

 as the saying goes if you want a friend get a dog _meta_end_dot_

 but if you want a congressman nominate eric egland _meta_end_dot_
