  barring a political miracle senator john mccain will win the gop primaries in texas and ohio today and most likely garner enough delegates to lock up our party s presidential nomination _meta_end_dot_

 i know many of you aren t thrilled about supporting mccain and some of y all have even made blood oaths that you will never vote for that man and trust me _meta_end_dot_

 i get it _meta_end_dot_

 i know exactly where y all are coming from _meta_end_dot_

 for some it was mccain s opposition to president bush s tax cuts _meta_end_dot_

 for others it was mccain s cheerleading for patently unconstitutional campaign finance legislation _meta_end_dot_

 for social conservatives it was mccain s support for federal funding of embryonic stem cell research _meta_end_dot_

 and for many it was all of the above as well as mccain s propensity for bucking the republican establishment and cozying up to liberal dems like ted kennedy _meta_end_dot_

 understandably these things have irked many a conservative including yours truly _meta_end_dot_

 more below the fold that having been said the fact remains that there is a method to mccain s madness _meta_end_dot_

 his status as a maverick republican helped him stand out from the senate crowd put him in a position to forcefully challenge then governor bush for the gop nomination in _meta_number_ref_ and almost certainly is the reason behind his securing the nomination this time _meta_end_dot_

 so let s give credit where credit is due mccain s political acumen is pretty damn strong _meta_end_dot_

 indeed even mccain s most fierce detractors have to admire the way the good senator came back from the political graveyard in lazarus like fashion to secure the gop nomination _meta_end_dot_

 these are the attributes of a man who will be a formidable candidate regardless of who the dems nominate _meta_end_dot_

 but alexham what about ideas principles and party loyalty _meta_end_question_

 shouldn t these things matter _meta_end_question_

 hell yes they matter _meta_end_dot_

 indeed that is the primary purpose of the gop nomination process _meta_end_dot_

 and lord knows i ve been a purist _meta_end_dot_

 until today i supported governor mike huckabee solely on the basis of his positions on culture of life issues _meta_end_dot_

 but the time for purity is over _meta_end_dot_

 we have a nominee and it is high time for conservatives to bury any grudges they have against senator mccain and do everything in their power to help him become the forty fourth president of these united states _meta_end_dot_

 i realize of course that many of you have no intention of supporting john mccain and no amount of rah rah go team rhetoric is going to persuade you otherwise _meta_end_dot_

 once again i get it _meta_end_dot_

 lord knows that senator mccain has torched many a bridge _meta_end_dot_

 but let s get real for a moment shall we _meta_end_question_

 the republican brand is about as popular right now as the kid with blue dye next to him in the swimming pool and that fact isn t going to change any time soon _meta_end_dot_

 the brutal truth of the matter is that john mccain may be our only hope this year _meta_end_dot_

 and while many of you no doubt have fantasies about how time in the wilderness will help bring about a restoration of the real republican party as i often did re rudy the reality is that a great deal of damage can be done by a president obama or clinton in the next four years _meta_end_dot_

 is that something you re really willing to risk _meta_end_question_

 three to four supreme court appointments _meta_end_question_

 major tax increases _meta_end_question_

 implementation of a radical proabortion agenda _meta_end_question_

 dialing down the war on terror _meta_end_question_

 perhaps you are willing to do just that _meta_end_dot_

 but as for me and my house we will strongly support john mccain for president _meta_end_dot_

 he may not be perfect but he s a damn fine politician and he s light years better than obama or clinton _meta_end_dot_
