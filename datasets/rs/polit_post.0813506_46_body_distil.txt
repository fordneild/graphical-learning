  duly noted _meta_end_dot_

 and yes there have been quite a spate of news stories piously reminding us of all the things we are not supposed to say about senator obama and all of the negative comments we are almost bound and obliged to say about senator mccain _meta_end_dot_

 i don t blame the obama campaign for trying to spin things their way but i certainly have a problem with mainstream journalists who enable the narrative and then tell us in the very next breath that there is no such thing as ideological bias in journalism _meta_end_dot_

 yeah right _meta_end_dot_

 give credit to vegas casinos when credit is due at least the casinos are subtle when they try to stack the deck _meta_end_dot_
