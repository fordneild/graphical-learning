  ever since the referendum offering venezuelan president hugo chavez unlimited terms went down to defeat early this year we have heard little from latin america s favorite tinhorn dictator _meta_end_dot_

 apparently fearing that we have forgotten all about him chavez has decided to burst back onto the international scene i told you so it s always amusing to listen to hugo chavez denounce others for imperialism _meta_end_dot_

 no one in latin america practices imperialist policies more fervently than he does _meta_end_dot_
