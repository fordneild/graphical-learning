  namely keith olbermann _meta_end_dot_

 ever since the obama passport breach story came out olbermann has worked himself into quite the lather asking over and over what did the bush administration know and when did they know it_meta_beep_ref_ so convinced is olbermann that the breach of the passport files constituted a rovian plot the likes of which msnbc pays keith good money to rail against whether or not there is actually any basis in reality to do so _meta_end_dot_

 doubtless the fever pitch worked itself into a veritable frenzy when it was revealed that hillary clinton s passport files were breached as well _meta_end_dot_

 the worst fears and most self righteous fantasies of olbermann and his comrades in rant were apparently realized _meta_end_dot_

 the gop is out to get the democrats _meta_end_exclamation_

 nixon would have been proud _meta_end_exclamation_

 except a monkey wrench has now been thrown into the fantasizing john mccain s passport files have been breached as well _meta_end_dot_

 kind of makes it more difficult to believe that this is a project of the vast right wing conspiracy doesn t it _meta_end_question_

 i mean if republicans are so sinister so rovian as utterly power mad as olbermann company make us out to be why would we try to take out our own nominee _meta_end_question_

 things that make you go hmmm eh _meta_end_question_

 that sound you hear in the background is olbermann s brain cell yes note the singular construction of that word cell exploding _meta_end_dot_

 of course if olbermann wanted someone to rail at perhaps he could have gone after comrade in rant joe conason _meta_end_dot_

 see conason thought it wise to call for the release of barack obama s passport files _meta_end_dot_

 evidently it was so important for conason to find out whether or not obama traveled to europe that he essentially advocated the very intrusion into obama s privacy that olbermann is spending so much time denouncing _meta_end_dot_

 look i know that florida and michigan and the prospects of a long and bloody nomination fight have gotten olbermann and the comrades in rant down _meta_end_dot_

 but really there s just no reason for the reality based community to stop being so reality based with their commentary _meta_end_dot_

 i mean they were reality based to begin with right _meta_end_question_

 right _meta_end_question_

 why is no one answering in the affirmative _meta_end_question_
