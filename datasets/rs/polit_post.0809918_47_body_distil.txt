  whut whut sound as they arced through the air above us ferocious unrelenting yet somehow comforting to the ear _meta_end_dot_

 beneath us the lazy curves of the mississippi river stretched and sighed in the afternoon sun the roiling water full of life and memory _meta_end_dot_

 as the rotor turned i remembered the drawl of the smiling natchez lawyer who told me when i was younger that this river carried in itself the story of america which to my jackson born ears sounded like a loftier way of saying that this carved out scar of flowing water was big it was unstoppable and without it none of us would be _meta_end_dot_

 or if we were we would not be children of the american south taught tales from the crib of the tragic accidents of history brought up with the knowledge that existence is a fragile fate filled thing _meta_end_dot_

 the wall was in pointe coupee parish and the men building it were soldiers from the _meta_number_ref_th engineering brigade _meta_end_dot_

 it was an amazing site from the sky following the line of the potato levee along the atchafalaya river basin an unbroken line of _meta_number_ref_ foot by _meta_number_ref_ foot sacks glinting white in the sunlight _meta_end_dot_

 we set down in the mud and walked to where they were sealing a final hole mashing _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ pounds of dirt into the stretched sacks donated by a local company when filled as strong as a bunker _meta_end_dot_

 much better than the ones we used in _meta_number_ref_ said one veteran who worked on saving the same swathe of land _meta_number_ref_ years ago _meta_end_dot_

 when finished it would stretch for more than two miles _meta_end_dot_

 the farmers were sincere men sunburned and smiling in their checked shirts _meta_end_dot_

 they saluted the national guard members with the eagerness of young boys and could not stop thanking anyone who was anyone _meta_end_dot_

 you would do that too of course if someone s action and quick response was about to save your nearly _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ acres of wheat and soybeans _meta_end_dot_

 but what you wouldn t be able to do of course was cook them a meal like these farmers did _meta_end_dot_

 what are you boys eating one of the farmer s wives had asked on the first day _meta_end_dot_

 mres ma am read on _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 not in south louisiana you re not the farmers said _meta_end_dot_

 so that night the men feasted on crawfish touff e fried catfish and homemade bread _meta_end_dot_

 and then they went back to building the wall _meta_end_dot_

 only a few days earlier the farmers had sent a group to talk to louisiana s new governor bobby jindal pleading for help _meta_end_dot_

 they hadn t known what to expect _meta_end_dot_

 but they never expected this _meta_end_dot_

 i was very surprised they sent out the national guard farmer marty graham told a local reporter _meta_end_dot_

 he and the other men had been working furiously with their wives and children using makeshift sandbags with little hope of finishing by the time the water crested _meta_end_dot_

 but by monday the help came _meta_end_dot_

 and so the big wide shouldered louisiana farmers met the slim governor youngest in the nation as they would a conquering hero _meta_end_dot_

 out of earshot of the soldiers i asked one of the farmers what he thought of governor jindal _meta_end_dot_

 he squinted at me as if surprised i didn t know his answer already then smiled _meta_end_dot_

 he answered seriously he s the man we flew back toward the capitol building and the warring politicians inside a building where the old order is clashing with more than _meta_number_ref_ new faces in the legislature and where the policy battle to determine louisiana s future is only beginning _meta_end_dot_

 the water is high _meta_end_dot_

 but here as it is throughout the state jindal s triune message is one that speaks to the stakes at hand and his commitment to win _meta_end_dot_

 the wall can hold _meta_end_dot_

 it must hold _meta_end_dot_

 it will hold _meta_end_dot_

 jindal s team will make sure it does _meta_end_dot_

 the policy staff would be a crack outfit for a president of the united states and they need to be to navigate the odd peculiarities of louisiana law trust me it s charming until you actually have to wrestle with it _meta_end_dot_

 the cabinet is filled with amazingly litany of capable managers and policy innovators _meta_end_dot_

 whip smart commissioner of administration ang le davis has a golden touch she could make the oakland raiders a contender _meta_end_dot_

 labor secretary tim barfield is the former president of the shaw group _meta_end_dot_

 secretary of health and hospitals alan levine who worked for years in florida for gov _meta_end_dot_

 jeb bush and in the private sector is maybe the only person in america who knows more about health policy than jindal himself _meta_end_dot_

 mark cooper who heads up the governor s office of homeland security and emergency preparedness is perhaps the best example of the kind of amazing pull jindal has an lsu grad who left the state like so many other bright young men and women and who most recently ran the los angeles county fire department managing a billion dollar budget contacted jindal s transition team after reading a wall street journal article titled bayou bobby a new governor offers hope for disaffected louisiana expats like so many others he ll tell you he came back to help his state recognizing the unique opportunity for renewal and change _meta_end_dot_

 that change won t come easily despite jindal s early policy successes _meta_end_dot_

 his special sessions were stunning achievements yes and speak to the momentum he carries with him _meta_end_dot_

 jindal s ethics reforms have made fundamental changes already in the way the legislature does business and the tax policies have already made louisiana a model for how state government should lift restrictions and let the free market work _meta_end_dot_

 but his plan to respond to new orleans educational crisis and his policy goals for the coming year will likely make him public enemy number one for the teacher unions organizations for whom competition and inner city scholarships are viewed as threats _meta_end_dot_

 the next wins will be harder fought and there should be blood on the floor when it s all done _meta_end_dot_

 there s no question that the baton rouge media gaggle is loaded for bear _meta_end_dot_

 confused about how to cover a governor who is so authentic so free of scandal and so open about his philosophy of government and policy views they re determined to give him as short a grace period as possible _meta_end_dot_

 and when the next storm comes and it is not a question of if it is a question of when no one should trust that the stories they and national journalists write about the next storm will be fair or balanced _meta_end_dot_

 if they see any opportunity to stop a rising star the face of a new brand of conservative someone who has accomplished more meaningful reform in a few weeks in the governor s mansion than barack obama has accomplished in his entire career there s no doubt they will try _meta_end_dot_

 so many governors in louisiana history have started out strong and yet so few have been reelected _meta_end_dot_

 they will do their best to stack the odds against him because that is what they do _meta_end_dot_

 yet if those close to jindal are cognizant of that it quite honestly isn t part of his focus _meta_end_dot_

 his love for his job is evident you can end all that veep talk folks ain t gonna happen _meta_end_dot_

 his state is the only thing on his mind _meta_end_dot_

 well maybe one or two other things the future of conservatism for one _meta_end_dot_

 the simple measure of the movement for jindal as he repeats in his soft spoken but absolutely serious voice is whether as conservatives we actually have confidence in our ideas confidence enough to put them to the test _meta_end_dot_

 when crises arise so often the modern beltway conservative response is to run from our principles to offer a plan that s just about throwing taxpayer money at a problem or a poorly run agency and just do it slightly cheaper than the liberals do _meta_end_dot_

 it s the ideology of the limp wrist a response to challenge that throws fiscal responsibility out of the window that says there is no point where policy compromise is worse than principled defeat that says giving parents the freedom to determine where their child goes to school is a good idea in theory but let s not rock the boat on this one _meta_end_dot_

 if the conservative movement that won the cold war passed welfare reform and revitalized the american economy in the _meta_number_ref_th century is going to serve this country well in the _meta_number_ref_st they must learn to have the courage to do what s right _meta_end_dot_

 we advocate for policy change not just because it s principled but we believe that it works better for the american people that most conservative solutions fundamentally understand human nature in a way that liberal ones do not _meta_end_dot_

 and that when we are confronted by a candidate like obama whose sheen of hopechange disguises a candidate who has no daylight on policy between himself and ted kennedy we can explain why those policy differences matter _meta_end_dot_

 jindal himself does not need to learn the definition of principled leadership _meta_end_dot_

 the skill comes naturally to him _meta_end_dot_

 he knows he is building a great thing but his perfectionist spirit means he is not yet mindful of the greatness of this accomplishment _meta_end_dot_

 but even if he doesn t the families of louisiana already understand the wind has changed _meta_end_dot_

 they can feel it a larger change than any one piece of legislation or one slate of policy fixes could achieve _meta_end_dot_

 this is something more fundamental _meta_end_dot_

 for once the word possibility is said with real optimism and by people who once unlike the well heeled crowds of suburbanites at yeswecan rallies had no hope at all for the future _meta_end_dot_

 the odds are still poor the waters are high yes but the wall will hold this time _meta_end_dot_

 they have a governor who will be sure of it _meta_end_dot_

 as a young lsu grad told me as we looked out over the mississippi the ripples glistening in the amber light of sunset if anyone can do it he can the water is high _meta_end_dot_

 but the new louisiana is coming _meta_end_dot_

 bobby jindal is building it _meta_end_dot_
