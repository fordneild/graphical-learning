  governor rick perry and his posse are at it again this time spending texas money to save us from ourselves over our inability to put down that burrito and back away for you non texans that emerging technology fund has been disrespectfully called perry s slush fund and is frequently used to provide cash incentives meaning tax breaks to entice companies to move to texas _meta_end_dot_

 sounds good on paper but while taxes inch up at the state and local levels looking for ever new and wildly creative revenue streams the state still insists on spending new money on old problems best solved by changes in personal behavior _meta_end_dot_

 lest we forget it was just over a year ago that perry was trying to line another pharma company s pockets when he ordered cervical cancer vaccines for schoolgirls _meta_end_dot_

 fortunately perry s err hat was handed to him in the legislature on that one but the esteemed conservative yes quote end quote conservative governor seems hell bent on taking charge of our lives and spending our money to do it _meta_end_dot_

 hand raised from the cheap seats isn t personal responsibility and being accountable for our own lives and the actions we take one of the cornerstones of the conservative ideology _meta_end_question_

 here s a thought put down the triple meat with cheese whataburger and go to the gym _meta_end_dot_
