  well it s time once again see here and here to update the chart with what should now be the complete democratic presidential primary popular vote totals for the months of march april and may i delayed in getting this posted because it took until very late today to get all the votes tallied from oregon and in fact i m running this with _meta_percent_ref_ of precincts there reporting because who knows how long that last _meta_percent_ref_ will take _meta_end_dot_

 of course a handful of late votes are still trickling in from in nc too _meta_end_dot_

 source _meta_end_dot_

 in other words even before we get to puerto rico obama is nearly half a million votes in the hole since the events of late february and early march i e the _meta_number_ref_am ad the goolsbee nafta flap and of course the rev _meta_end_dot_

 wright story _meta_end_dot_

 now let s look at turnout using the same baseline as before the number of votes in _meta_number_ref_ for house democrats in the state this time i ll just run the chart just for the same time period the full chart and explanation of sources is here read on _meta_end_dot_

 you will note that turnout was down from the boom in the early may primaries but at least in kentucky the voters still turned out in quite large numbers in the face of the obama camp s argument that there was nothing left to vote on _meta_end_dot_

 obama had more success in oregon where turnout was much lower _meta_end_dot_

 let s update last week s projections by bringing the turnout back down to _meta_percent_ref_ for south dakota and montana relative to the _meta_number_ref_ figures while still using the conservative _meta_percent_ref_ estimate for puerto rico _meta_end_dot_

 i still don t have new polls for puerto rico south dakota or montana i m still using the one poll each from the first two and the imputed poll results from the matchup with mccain for the third _meta_end_dot_

 here s where that would get us how much guesswork is in this last chart _meta_end_question_

 a lot _meta_end_dot_

 we really are operating in the dark as to these last three primaries _meta_end_dot_

 conservative south dakota blogger ken blanchard argued last week that the poll in his state is too optimistic for obama we shall see one would hope someone would bother running one last poll _meta_end_dot_

 for obama though the best news is that there are only three more of these to go _meta_end_dot_
