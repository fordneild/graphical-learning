 redstate and human events have teamed up for a weekly column called redstate under the radar a lot of our friends don t read blogs so they miss out on a lot of news the msm won t cover _meta_end_dot_

 each week i ll be highlighting redstate stories and other news from around the blogosphere that the msm has failed to cover or cover accurately _meta_end_dot_

 the pinocchiobama graphic goes with the debut column _meta_end_dot_

 at the end of each column i m going to cover topics from around the fifty states that state and local bloggers are focusing on _meta_end_dot_

 let me express my thoughts on condi for veep here _meta_end_dot_

 condi is a truly spectacular woman _meta_end_dot_

 she is accomplished in so many areas _meta_end_dot_

 she is truly brilliant _meta_end_dot_

 and by all accounts she is a very nice person _meta_end_dot_

 additionally she knows more about football than i ever will _meta_end_dot_

 to the best of my knowledge condi is also in favor of affirmative action is pro choice and has failed to win the battle against the state department bureaucracy _meta_end_dot_

 in fact by all outward appearances she has succumbed to the state department an organization human events listed this year as one of the most dangerous liberal groups in the nation _meta_end_dot_

 i could not support condi for veep any more than i could support charlie crist for veep _meta_end_dot_

 as far as i am concerned we must make our motto on mccain s selection no squishes allowed read on _meta_end_dot_

 several news outlets are pushing a story coming from far left blogs about mccain s personal life _meta_end_dot_

 he allegedly has a terrible temper in private when no one else is around except lefty fabulists and his wife _meta_end_dot_

 one allegation is that he called his wife the c word that rhymes with hunt _meta_end_dot_

 i myself have had a ron paul supporter call my house and call my wife that _meta_end_dot_

 perhaps the lefty should have made sure there were no ron paul supporters in the room with him and mr _meta_end_dot_

 mrs _meta_end_dot_

 mccain _meta_end_dot_

 i think this speaks volumes about iraq _meta_end_dot_

 we ve gone from lefty fabulists making up stories about the war atrocities they never actually committed to making up stories about john mccain s personal life _meta_end_dot_

 the war must be going well _meta_end_dot_

 i wonder if the new republic and new york times will give these stories front page treatment like they did all the lefty fabulists fibbing about the war _meta_end_dot_

 fox news kindly sent a car last night to take me to my debut appearance on hannity colmes _meta_end_dot_

 in all seriousness the last four times i have gone to be on fox i ve been pre empted by tornados earthquakes or other natural disasters _meta_end_dot_

 i made sure the family was safe and secure before attempting to go _meta_end_dot_

 it was a fun experience _meta_end_dot_

 i don t really care for all the talking over and past each other but i think i got my major point out obama has no experience on which to judge him _meta_end_dot_

 we must instead look to his judgment _meta_end_dot_

 in obama s judgment it was just fine to befriend a terrorist leader of the weather underground and have reverend wright as his pastor _meta_end_dot_

 let s also not forget the communist harpy he married who only decided she was proud of her country when her husband decided to run for potus _meta_end_dot_

 this man has a tendency to surround himself with people who loath this country and the only positions on which he is firm are the one s about which he is lying _meta_end_dot_
