  assertions supporting president bush s attendance at the beijing games must be logically rebutted for they mask a more dangerous myth _meta_end_dot_

 to wit the opponents of the president s attendance are politicizing the olympics the olympics is just a sporting event the opponents of the president s attendance should have raised these issues when beijing was chosen to host the olympics a group of republicans and a democrat immediately requested in writing he not attend the beijing games _meta_end_dot_

 the president can use an olympic visit to raise human rights issues with china s communist regime the president has already accepted the invitation and can t change his mind now the dangerous myth according to our secretary of state the chinese people need to know that the united states and the american people support their emergence on the world stage the eternal truth america does not escort nuclear armed communist dictatorships onto the world s stage america puts nuclear armed communist dictatorships into history s dust bin _meta_end_dot_

 future injections of logic into this debate will occur as required _meta_end_dot_
