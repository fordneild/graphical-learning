  a slew of new polls were released yesterday _meta_end_dot_

 they range from romney _meta_number_ref_ to mccain _meta_number_ref_ with most showing a statistical tie _meta_end_dot_

 the one poll that has been taken twice post nh is from mitchell research which shows a shift from mccain _meta_number_ref_ to mccain _meta_number_ref_ in a two day period _meta_end_dot_

 specifically their first sample was notably low on romney support _meta_percent_ref_ while the new one has him at _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 overall the rcp average for the race has romney ahead _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ to _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 it seems that the arg poll has an usually pro mccain sample _meta_percent_ref_ just as it did in nh _meta_end_dot_

 huckabee has had some improvement in the polls but is still back in _meta_number_ref_rd with _meta_percent_ref_ in the rcp average _meta_end_dot_

 the futures markets after nh had jumped their prediction of mccain winning to _meta_percent_ref_ and romney down to _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 with this new spate of polling they now put the race at _meta_percent_ref_ mccain _meta_percent_ref_ romney _meta_end_dot_

 this is a dead heat _meta_end_dot_

 one last important point on mi polling how pollsters deal with the possibility of independents and democrats voting is important _meta_end_dot_

 arg actually breaks down their sample into rs and is but doesn t mention ds _meta_end_dot_

 that could be accurate or an oversight _meta_end_dot_

 according to the most pro romney poll mason dixon romney is up _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ and the internals show in a rasmussen poll that mirrors the rcp average romney _meta_number_ref_ the breakdown of rs and non rs is romney mccain other _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ thus unlike nh where mccain won registered rs and registered is if he wins mi it could be because he wins is and loses rs _meta_end_dot_

 then again the polls could be off by _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ points like they were in the nh dem race _meta_end_dot_

 more likely this will be close to the finish and romney has the momentum right now _meta_end_dot_
