  the political discourse turned to economic matters in the last few days _meta_end_dot_

 we got the usual spate of bizarre and uninformed questions from msm journalists to all of the primary contenders _meta_end_dot_

 these are ignorable for the most part _meta_end_dot_

 we also got proposals for fast acting economic stimulus packages from the two dem frontrunners and co dependents hillary clinton and barack obama _meta_end_dot_

 their proposals are worth picking apart mostly by way of showing how mired in the past these two people are when it comes to economic policy _meta_end_dot_

 president bush has also threatened to propose a stimulus package but nothing has leaked out yet _meta_end_dot_

 does it even need to be said that with these proposals the democrats are trying to solve not an economic problem but a political one _meta_end_question_

 more _meta_end_dot_

 if you pay attention to the world of global finance you know that it s undergoing the most severe and sustained disruptions since the collapse of the bretton woods system in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 tectonic plates are moving rapidly but well under the surface and this promises to be a momentous year _meta_end_dot_

 but how does that affect ordinary people and why do the politicians have to wade in now _meta_end_question_

 three basic reasons the us stock market has taken it on the chin since the new year the price of oil briefly traded above _meta_dollor_ref_ bbl last week before backing down and the december employment report from the bureau of labor statistics suggested significant weakness in private sector hiring _meta_end_dot_

 add this to the news background about recession fears and you have the ingredients for ordinary people to feel frightened that they might lose their jobs _meta_end_dot_

 this is mother s milk to politicians who live for opportunities to prove that we really need them after all _meta_end_dot_

 so if you fear that the economy is going to start throwing millions of people out of work what do you propose _meta_end_question_

 well if you re a good keynesian circa _meta_number_ref_ vintage you propose what s called an economic stimulus package _meta_end_dot_

 what the heck is that _meta_end_question_

 well you start by reasoning that people are going to lose their jobs because other people aren t spending enough money on soap and car payments _meta_end_dot_

 so you take a big pot of money and you hand it out to people hoping they ll _meta_end_dot_

 well stimulate the economy _meta_end_dot_

 that s the essence of both the clinton proposal which contains five specific points and the obama proposal which sounds audaciously hopeful but is of course very short on detail _meta_end_dot_

 both of them are talking about handing out sums of money ranging from _meta_dollor_ref_ billion to over _meta_dollor_ref_ billion _meta_end_dot_

 let s analyze some of the rhetoric a bit _meta_end_dot_

 both clinton and obama are saying that their proposals are not to be understood as things they would seek to enact upon becoming president in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 rather both are suggestions of what they would do right this minute _meta_end_dot_

 the idea is that the economy needs help now and that president bush isn t giving it _meta_end_dot_

 of course the president who answers to the same idiots in the msm that the democrats do will end up proposing something broadly similar hence you hear the term fast acting stimulus as near as i can figure this is why both of the dem packages propose one time tax credits subsidies for heating oil bills in clinton s case counseling for people who can t afford their mortgages _meta_dollor_ref_ billion from obama for that and tax relief ie federal handouts for cities and other localities where housing distress has reduced property tax revenue _meta_end_dot_

 what no one is proposing obviously is to make the bush _meta_number_ref_ and _meta_number_ref_ tax cuts permanent _meta_end_dot_

 what no one is talking about either is where all the money is going to come from _meta_end_dot_

 let s be honest about this kids _meta_end_dot_

 it s going to be borrowed and added to the deficit _meta_end_dot_

 that s the whole idea behind keynesian economic stimulus to induce the consumption of resources that would otherwise remain invested in savings or capital assets _meta_end_dot_

 i suppose there s half a chance that if either democrat is pressed on where the money for the stimulus will come from they will both show their ignorance and say from higher taxes on the rich rather than the true answer which is from the bond market one can only hope _meta_end_dot_

 a key feature that has been stressed is that the stimulus will put money into the hands of lower income people _meta_end_dot_

 one assumes these are the people most subject to the fear justified or not of losing their jobs and therefore might be most politically responsive to the message _meta_end_dot_

 i even heard gene sperling of clinton s brain trust if you ll pardon the expression say that most economists agree economic stimulus works best if you give money to people who are likely to spend it rather than save it _meta_end_dot_

 so we would prospectively get a one time pulse of _meta_dollor_ref_ billion or so in consumer spending using money borrowed from global investors _meta_end_dot_

 by my figures that s seven tenths of one percent of total consumer spending by americans _meta_end_dot_

 yeah i think that ll help _meta_end_dot_

 not so now we know that the whole idea is not economically serious but rather a standard pandering appeal to the fears of people who don t know any better abetted by journalists who should know better but probably don t _meta_end_dot_

 there s another interesting wrinkle in clinton s plan which emerges because unlike obama she had the presence of mind to give some detail on how she d spend the money _meta_end_dot_

 it s largely going to be dispensed in packages to be distributed by state and local governments _meta_end_dot_

 heating oil subsidies mortgage payment relief relief for local governments with lower tax revenue are you reading between the lines _meta_end_question_

 most of the people who will get to spend clinton s booty are local politicians who are usually democrats _meta_end_dot_

 pretty clever way to pay off the people on the ground in those tough primary and general election battleground states _meta_end_dot_

 say what you will about mrs _meta_end_dot_

 clinton but she s not stupid _meta_end_dot_

 economic split personality finally let me explain to you why keynesian economic stimulus isn t going to work on the economy in the first place in short because it addresses the wrong problem _meta_end_dot_

 the us economy has a split personality these days _meta_end_dot_

 wall street the financial sector and the housing sector are all in terrible shape _meta_end_dot_

 there is a lot of fear probably justified that consumer durables and related sectors will slow down significantly this year _meta_end_dot_

 meanwhile other sectors of the economy including export related businesses are roaring ahead and expect a great year in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 now how do recessions happen since everyone is so heated up about the subject _meta_end_question_

 recessions are most reliably predicted by constrained availability of credit _meta_end_dot_

 this can happen in a variety of ways and that s another long post in itself bottom line many sectors of our economy are facing just this problem and they will slow down as night follows day _meta_end_dot_

 but businesspeople make investment decisions on relatively long time scales often a year or more ahead _meta_end_dot_

 neither they nor their reluctant sources of credit traditionally banks but these days more likely the commercial paper market will be affected by a one time burst of consumer spending _meta_end_dot_

 permanent tax cuts would be a totally different story _meta_end_dot_

 and no policy can address the reluctance to provide credit in the first place which is rooted in risk aversion by global investors better opportunities outside the us and other factors _meta_end_dot_

 for hillary clinton and barack obama to propose a fast acting stimulus which does nothing more than borrow _meta_dollor_ref_ billion to spend on candy and bubble gum shows that neither one knows the first thing about how to deal with policy in our complex and challenging economy _meta_end_dot_

 let s do our best to keep both of them from having to learn on the job at our expense _meta_end_dot_
