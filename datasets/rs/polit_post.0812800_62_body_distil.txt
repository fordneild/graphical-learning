  if you watched the election returns tonight you undoubtedly saw barack obama win north carolina by a fairly wide margin _meta_end_dot_

 of course that s north carolina s democrats and even among the democrats he yet again got clobbered among white voters _meta_end_dot_

 but if you slice the salami of the electorate until it looks like the kind of people who vote in democratic primaries in a state like north carolina obama is indeed the people s choice _meta_end_dot_

 it s easier after all to be the people s choice if you choose the right people to be the choice of _meta_end_dot_

 if you watched him on television you undoubtedly saw barack obama speak tonight before a large and enthusiastic crowd at reynolds coliseum on n c _meta_end_dot_

 state s campus _meta_end_dot_

 but just as with the north carolina democratic primary electorate it turns out that the illusion of obama s enormous popularity is a function of limiting the people in this case roping off a single corner of the arena _meta_end_dot_

 mary katherine ham has a great post contrasting the picture you see above her image with what you saw on television _meta_end_dot_

 individual results may differ _meta_end_dot_
