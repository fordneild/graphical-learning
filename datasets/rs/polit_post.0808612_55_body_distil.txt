  via politico we have the forming of the dem strategy for beating mccain in november mccain doctrine hunh _meta_end_dot_

 has a sorta nice ring to it dontchathink _meta_end_question_

 i certainly like it better than the obama doctrine the obamatrine of tuck tail and run citing obama s remarks on the _meta_number_ref_th anniversary of our presence in iraq politico suggests the real hammer the democrats will likely be swinging appears to something more like _meta_number_ref_ years of capitulation exit strategy is a great buzz word and occupation gets all the new generation of hippies chanting something incoherent about attica but as mccain reminded us in the real quote we re _meta_number_ref_ years running with a presence in japan and germany _meta_number_ref_ in korea how is iraq long term different _meta_end_question_

 oh that s right there are still bad guys in iraq with guns and explosives _meta_end_dot_

 we need to get the heck outta dodge until there are no more bad guys _meta_end_dot_

 why on earth would we have soldiers doing the work of soldiers where there is currently a need for soldiers _meta_end_question_

 when will we hear barry and hill demand an exit strategy in these places _meta_end_question_

 september _meta_end_question_

 october _meta_end_question_

 more below the fold _meta_end_dot_

 politico reminds us further down in the piece that mccain s original quote mysteriously bastardized by the left meant to point out we are in lots of places around the world and have been for a very long time the democrats know there is a difference between an american presence in a foreign county some of whom wear the uniform where we provide support and service and watch out for our own best interests in security and intelligence and an occupation but this straight talk contradicts what the democrats would have us believe _meta_end_dot_

 leaving iraq and negotiating with terrorists suits the democrats just fine _meta_end_dot_

 they are making clear what they mean to do with mccain in the general except he isn t more of the same no matter how hard they will try to frame the debate to the contrary _meta_end_dot_

 mccain spoke up for more troops earlier in the game and has taken a lot of cheap shots at the president and his secdefs all throughout the war _meta_end_dot_

 it ain t gonna fly kids but we get to the punch line on page _meta_number_ref_ mccain s camp intends to show the public that there is a way out of there without the worst consequences befalling us _meta_end_dot_

 then you can re earn their patience to do that you guessed it democrats have something different in mind so if i have this straight the plan is to redefine everything mccain has said and done over the years into something he hasn t and then redefine everything he says he will do into something he won t _meta_end_dot_

 if they can do that why they just might pull this thing off _meta_end_exclamation_

 why don t they just run on why they re so much better instead of why mccain isn t _meta_end_question_

 nevermind that was a rhetorical question _meta_end_dot_

 remember the democrat motto why fight for something you believe in when you can just take it away from those who have it already and give it to those who wouldn t know what to do with it if they did _meta_end_question_
