  last evening dan mclaughlin and i had the privilege of attending a dinner at the four seasons hotel given by our friends at the powerline blog _meta_end_dot_

 the purpose of the event was to honor longtime commentary editor norman podhoretz on the occasion of his recently published book world war iv _meta_end_dot_

 quite a constellation of journalists bloggers and dignitaries were present _meta_end_dot_

 the evening featured speeches by henry kissinger mark steyn and mr _meta_end_dot_

 podhoretz followed by a panel discussion and q a _meta_end_dot_

 look on this page from gateway pundit for some photos from the event _meta_end_dot_

 scroll down the page and you ll see dan miscredited as ken and yours truly miscredited as anonymous _meta_end_dot_

 the subject was the bush doctrine _meta_end_dot_

 read on _meta_end_dot_

 it seems almost impolite these days to point out that we re still engaged in a global war against terror and more specifically against terror perpetrated by radicals in the name of islam _meta_end_dot_

 our nation s political discourse seems to have moved on to an obsession with change what do you suppose is the thing many people think needs to be changed _meta_end_question_

 well the bush administration s focus on confronting the islamic terror threat of course _meta_end_dot_

 sitting in the four seasons last night i felt like i was in an isolated little pocket of awareness that the world still faces a determined enemy that can not to be confronted or defeated in conventional ways and is fully committed to the destruction of western society _meta_end_dot_

 it felt pretty lonely _meta_end_dot_

 i couldn t help imagining what it must have felt like in the dark days of the early cold war when the toughest enemy we faced was our own lack of conviction to continue the fight _meta_end_dot_

 it s always interesting to get dr _meta_end_dot_

 kissinger s perspective _meta_end_dot_

 he called himself an aspirant statesman and mr _meta_end_dot_

 podhoretz a visionary prophet and entertainingly pointed out the difference the statesman deals in the possible and the visionary deals in the ideal _meta_end_dot_

 you need both types _meta_end_dot_

 part of the focus in mr _meta_end_dot_

 podhoretz s book is to compare the current world war with the three that preceded it _meta_end_dot_

 some very interesting points came out of this in his remarks as well as dr _meta_end_dot_

 kissinger s and mark steyn s _meta_end_dot_

 the default approach to world war iv on the part of many observers is essentially identical to appeasement _meta_end_dot_

 steyn said that to many poeple today enemies are merely friends whose grievances we have not yet accommodated appeasement was perhaps not an unreasonable approach in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 but now that we know where it led it s unconscionable to pursue the same course and to ignore the lessons of some very bitter history _meta_end_dot_

 we were also reminded that churchill thought of world war ii as an unnecessary war _meta_end_dot_

 that s because as is well known there were at least two lost opportunities to eliminate the nazi threat through timely military action _meta_end_dot_

 keep this in mind because it will come back when we talk about iran _meta_end_dot_

 the key comparison to world war i is in the genesis of that war with the assassination of a minor hapsburg prince and ending in the dissolution of four global empires _meta_end_dot_

 keep this in mind when people tell you that _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ was merely a lucky strike easily forgotten and ultimately unimportant _meta_end_dot_

 i ve already touched on the cold war comparison _meta_end_dot_

 not only exhaustion from world war ii played into america s reluctance to fully engage the soviet threat _meta_end_dot_

 there was also a strong sense of sympathy particularly among policy and academic elites for the very ideology that had pledged to supersede western society _meta_end_dot_

 today as mark steyn pointed out it s darned hard to find many people who even think the instinct for societal self preservation is a good thing _meta_end_dot_

 to paraphrase a rumsfeldism we will have to fight world war iv with the people we have _meta_end_dot_

 and this presents a deep challenge _meta_end_dot_

 now there is also another key parallel between the cold war and today the presence of a reviled but visionary president of the united states _meta_end_dot_

 truman recognized the true dimensions of the soviet threat and mobilized a coherent policy to contain it _meta_end_dot_

 for this of course he was excoriated brutally at the time not least by republicans _meta_end_dot_

 mr _meta_end_dot_

 podhoretz pointed out in his remarks that after a bitter campaign in _meta_number_ref_ president eisenhower came to office the following january tacitly understanding the critical importance of the truman doctrine and he continued it _meta_end_dot_

 throughout the cold war there were constant questionings whether we could defeat the soviets and even whether we should _meta_end_dot_

 same as now _meta_end_dot_

 we did hold on to win the cold war of course _meta_end_dot_

 although no one mentioned ronald reagan in any of the public remarks during the evening mark steyn did wonder whether having won one ideological war it s possible to summon the will to win another _meta_end_dot_

 today we have the bush doctrine _meta_end_dot_

 to norman podhoretz this is the only coherent policy response anyone has yet devised to the threat of global islamic terror _meta_end_dot_

 and of course there are only a handful of people left who think of the bush doctrine without automatically thinking dismal failure historic folly and stupidity many of them were at the four seasons last night the essence of the bush doctrine of course is that the only way to pacify the states susceptible to the sponsorship of terror is to convert their regimes to liberal democratic ones through any means necessary including military means _meta_end_dot_

 in consequence podhoretz advocates the destruction of iran s nuclear capability _meta_end_dot_

 the intermediate steps in the logical chain were pointed out by dr _meta_end_dot_

 kissinger nuclear weapons in iran are intolerable regardless of the nature of the regime _meta_end_dot_

 this is a matter of simple arithmetic as a nuclear iran will inevitably lead to responses by israel egypt saudi arabia and perhaps other states _meta_end_dot_

 speaking as a man who engineered our program to prevent nuclear war among only two players he said that nuclear war is simply inevitable in a world with twenty or more _meta_end_dot_

 simply inevitable _meta_end_dot_

 i don t happen to necessarily accept that bringing liberal democracy to the states of the middle east and elsewhere is the answer _meta_end_dot_

 i have problems with the bush doctrine as formulated in these terms _meta_end_dot_

 i do think that a robust quasi imperial approach to global power is more likely to work _meta_end_dot_

 it would also be responsive to a range of other foreign policy imperatives that were not the topic last night but are no less important _meta_end_dot_

 dr _meta_end_dot_

 kissinger came very close to connecting these dots when he hinted that a permanent american military presence in iraq is needed _meta_end_dot_

 the dilemma of course is that no amount of negotiation or diplomacy can forestall the accession of the current iranian regime to nuclear capability _meta_end_dot_

 anyone who thinks otherwise has implicitly accepted that this will be the outcome as indeed the europeans seem to have done _meta_end_dot_

 at the end of the argument you re left with an inescapable reality which is that nuclear weapons are coming to iran and that nuclear war with millions or more of dead people lies ahead _meta_end_dot_

 the only alternative is to bomb the iranian nuclear sites _meta_end_dot_

 and the question was asked do we even have the military capability of doing so _meta_end_question_

 in podhoretz s opinion there is not the slightest doubt that this is technically possible _meta_end_dot_

 but is it politically possible especially in the eleven months remaining to the bush presidency and especially after the recent disastrous and mendacious nie report _meta_end_question_

 several people pointed out that even president bush has given signs of being resigned to the possibility that iran will go nuclear notably in the sotu address _meta_end_dot_

 in regard to current politics podhoretz had supported giuliani for president and now is resigned to supporting mccain who for all his faults does recognize the importance of winning world war iv _meta_end_dot_

 in terms of the democrats there seems no hope for barack obama _meta_end_dot_

 podhoretz holds out a faint glimmer of hope that a president clinton would emulate eisenhower in _meta_number_ref_ and tacitly accept and continue current policy _meta_end_dot_

 if we don t reverse iran s nuclear ambitions people fifty years from now will be asking about us as they did of the british in _meta_number_ref_ and _meta_number_ref_ why on earth didn t they act when there was still time if we do act now however and pursue a military action that will result in a slaughter of _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ or more iranian innocents our nation will live in permanent infamy _meta_end_dot_

 since the lessons of history are so easily forgotten we will replace the nazis the soviets and the chinese communists at the head of the list of bloodthirsty evil nations and will sacrifice any moral or political authority we have in the world _meta_end_dot_

 there s no easy way out _meta_end_dot_
