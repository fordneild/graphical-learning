  the quote that perhaps says it best comes to us from cq today penned by donnelly and rogin if i weren t still so gosh darned mad at them for having vilified the republicans undermined the commander in chief and knee capped our soldiers out there fighting to defend us against these lunatics and crazies around the world all for the sole purpose of ascending to power for power s sake _meta_end_dot_

 i d actually feel bad for them _meta_end_dot_

 but i don t _meta_end_dot_

 each of us has our own mental scrapbook busting at the seams with recollections of what democrats have said and done over the past two years and there s little that i remember that was positive inspiring or motivational _meta_end_dot_

 sure the republicans haven t been any better but we re in the minority member _meta_end_question_

 we re supposed to be scrapping and fighting to get what we want _meta_end_dot_

 i m reminded as i read through this cq piece of something harry reid said the other day _meta_end_dot_

 of course his intentions were entirely different but his suggestion that the american people are losing was spot on _meta_end_dot_

 we re losing time and money as these spoiled little children sit up on capitol hill sniping at each other hoping to score political points while the rest of us have to get up go to work provide for ourselves and our families and pay them to do nothing to improve our circumstances _meta_end_dot_

 we certainly are losing harry _meta_end_dot_

 more below the fold _meta_end_dot_

 the democrats wanted power because they were mad _meta_end_dot_

 they wanted to flatten our president and they wanted to blame everyone else for the troubles we all face in america _meta_end_dot_

 they re still mad only now it s because they didn t get their way and have only shame and disgrace to show for their efforts _meta_end_dot_

 they have lots of splainin to do in front of their donors as well but i ll leave the tar and feathers they richly deserve to those who will be called upon again next year to put them back in office i wouldn t want to be in their shoes that s for sure _meta_end_dot_

 i can t think of a time i was more happy about not being a democrat _meta_end_dot_

 having squandered whatever political capital they might have had the democrats have spent a full year blackmailing all of us over forcing a change in iraq policy _meta_end_dot_

 they ve held up nearly every major spending bill trying to leverage their moveon and code pink contingencies against the will of the majority of americans _meta_end_dot_

 most of the rest of us democrats and republicans alike prefer to see congress attending to matters of a more fundamental nature the matters that affect the every day lives of we the people we wanted congress to fix or at least address the problems inherent in our current bloated and ineffective areas of energy transportation education immigration social security and medicaid and the remaining entitlement programs _meta_end_dot_

 they failed to do so _meta_end_dot_

 we wanted them to clean up our house hold spending to some modicum of reality be sensible on taxation and do something about this silly and nonsensical earmarks business _meta_end_dot_

 they failed to do so _meta_end_dot_

 these are the things that involve running the peoples business these things are what affect us directly and these are what help define us as a nation _meta_end_dot_

 the democrats chose to define us singly through the prism that is iraq and in doing so find themselves empty handed with no place to go but down _meta_end_dot_

 we are a nation at war but we are also continuing to live our lives while our brave men and women are fighting it _meta_end_dot_

 the energy spent making our efforts in iraq out to be the only thing going on with america has forced them into their own little wilderness and the only thing of significance they ve managed to accomplish during all of their first year in the majority is an omnibus spending bill filled with pork and policy changes the implications of which we ll not fully realize until well into next year and crammed down our throats solely because of their big hurry to go on vacation _meta_end_dot_

 as bad as the republicans have been these last few years in the majority and as much as they might have earned their defeat at least they attended to the peoples business _meta_end_dot_

 the democrats continue to show how little they actually learned from their defeat s back in the _meta_number_ref_ s and appear destined to continue repeating the same mistakes over and over and over again all at our collective expense _meta_end_dot_

 they ran on empty promises they never kept they spent our money like teenagers with their first credit card or tried to at least and they let everyone of us down equally _meta_end_dot_

 they need to go and they need to go now _meta_end_dot_

 they have done nothing so well as they have proven they re not ready to lead a nation _meta_end_dot_

 it s time to put grown ups back in charge _meta_end_dot_
