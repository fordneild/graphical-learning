  in response to my postings here at redstate see here and here senator lamar alexander just took to the floor of the senate to inform his colleagues that many senators said it was the best retreat they had had in a long time _meta_end_dot_

 i bet those who said it were also appropriators because i assure you there were a number of republican senators who thought senator alexander s plan of action presented at the retreat is willfully naive in the get along to go along spirit of bob michels _meta_end_dot_

 also senator alexander said in response to my post that it is not the job of the republicans to tear down the democrats _meta_end_dot_

 first it is rather gratifying to see a united states senator forced to go to the floor of the senate to defend insanity against a lowly blogger _meta_end_dot_

 second senator alexander it is the job of the republican party to defeat the democratic party _meta_end_dot_

 you defeat them with better ideas _meta_end_dot_

 you defeat them in committee _meta_end_dot_

 you defeat them in parliamentary machinations _meta_end_dot_

 you defeat them on the floor _meta_end_dot_

 you defeat them at the ballot box _meta_end_dot_

 in short sir you win _meta_end_dot_

 you do not sit at harry reid s lap waiting for him to throw you a bone which is exactly what you are advocating _meta_end_dot_

 sure with your approach you ll pee on the floor on occasion to score a point but you and your party sir will always be the ones on the wrong end of the leash _meta_end_dot_

 buck up or squish out senator _meta_end_dot_

 we at redstate aim to win _meta_end_dot_
