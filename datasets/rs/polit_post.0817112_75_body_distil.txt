  i m taking ann althouse s word for it via instapundit that michelle obama talked up her husband s love for bacon which is something that i both can and can t understand the motivations for _meta_end_dot_

 it s clearly going for the obama isn t a muslim subtext you ll notice that nobody s ever thought to accuse him of being a secret jew which is actually a positive development in the field of conspiracy theory but the situation seems to be more suited to an educational approach _meta_end_dot_

 after all i agree with althouse there s nothing inherently wrong with being a muslim_meta_beep_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 it s a minor issue at any rate _meta_end_dot_

 so why did i bring it up _meta_end_question_

 because this isn t a minor issue at all background there are two problems here for the obama campaign _meta_end_dot_

 the first lesser problem is that shutting down any controversy on it should have been child s play the morning after the incident the senator throws an emergency press conference throws the staffer under the bus which bluntly would be well deserved in this case apologizes on behalf of the campaign to the two girls who would be there of course and says a few words about how swell muslims are and how we can t let ourselves be divided yadda yadda his scriptwriters know the drill _meta_end_dot_

 mccain clinton and or bush could do something like this in their sleep of course they also wouldn t have had this problem in the first place but then they re professionals _meta_end_dot_

 letting this drag on until today or tomorrow he will go public with a personal apology unless he s an actual idiot suggests at best a certain sluggishness in his decision process _meta_end_dot_

 he should look into that _meta_end_dot_

 what am i saying _meta_end_question_

 no he shouldn t _meta_end_dot_

 just a one time problem that s all _meta_end_dot_

 the second worse problem is why they were screening in the first place _meta_end_dot_

 this is not the first time that they ve done this of course and i bring that up not because the methods were identical but because it s reasonable to suggest the possibility that the goals were _meta_end_dot_

 these incidents do not fill me with confidence that the obama campaign lacks an institutional distrust of and disdain for the good judgment and discernment of white american voters _meta_end_dot_

 which is a nice way of saying that i think that the campaign unconsciously assumes that we re all a bunch of easily frightened racists _meta_end_dot_

 mind you i have an equally low opinion of the progressives that dominate the obama campaign familiarity breeding contempt and all that so you can take that as just another right wing death beast sneer _meta_end_dot_

 nonetheless the obama campaign needs to either clean up their operation so that they stop giving this impression or they need to have their candidate come out and give a real speech on race and prejudice _meta_end_dot_

 which is to say one where principle takes precedence over getting elected president _meta_end_dot_

 moe lane actually yes there are jews with african features _meta_end_dot_

 wrong region of the continent of course they re mostly from ethiopia or were until the israelis pulled most of them out _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_beep_ref_there s quite a bit wrong with being a jihadist subscribing to a perverted violent islamist fantasy ideology _meta_end_dot_

 there are rather less of those around these days though and thank god and his loyal human servants for that _meta_end_dot_
