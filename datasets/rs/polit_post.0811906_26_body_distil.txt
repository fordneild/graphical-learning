  i try not to link overly much to one particular blog i like to spread whatever linkage love i have but it is really difficult to refrain from linking to multiple posts at cafe hayek _meta_end_dot_

 don boudreaux and russell roberts are so amazingly good and post so much trenchant and valuable commentary that it is really difficult to refrain from telling readers go over and just scroll down and read stuff _meta_end_exclamation_

 you ll love it _meta_end_dot_

 so i won t refrain from doing so _meta_end_dot_

 what i will do however is point out some favorite recent posts
