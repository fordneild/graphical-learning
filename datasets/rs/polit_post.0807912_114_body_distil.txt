  and left people like me who were expecting a hundred point cut quite surprised _meta_end_dot_

 but wall street reacted well _meta_end_dot_

 in correspondence with brother blackhedd my fellow contributor at redstate he informs me that contrary to what was widely reported in the news the _meta_number_ref_ basis point cut was not as much of a surprise to traders as we might have been led to believe and that the market was perhaps heartened that the fed did not believe that a cut of a full percentage point was needed _meta_end_dot_

 by keeping the cut to _meta_number_ref_ basis points the fed left room for itself to fight inflation while at the same time stimulating economic growth _meta_end_dot_

 a larger cut may have evinced panic about market conditions and the last thing the fed wanted to do was to panic _meta_end_dot_

 the market s upward movement was a signal of its admiration _meta_end_dot_

 fair enough _meta_end_dot_

 brother blackhedd knows much concerning these matters and given the fact that i want to be an optimist i am more than happy to hope that his optimistic appraisal of the situation is the correct one _meta_end_dot_
