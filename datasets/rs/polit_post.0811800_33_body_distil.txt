  update i m impressed senator _meta_end_dot_

 i assumed that you d need at least a day to decide to run away from this particular fight _meta_end_dot_

 well that ll teach me not to wait too long on matters touching on your _meta_end_dot_

 ah uncritical willingness to accept danger is how i think tom wolfe put it just her and him in two minute back and forth sessions _meta_end_dot_

 no props and no prepared questions _meta_end_dot_

 mano a mano _meta_end_dot_

 this all assumes that senator obama thinks that he can handle it of course _meta_end_dot_

 read on _meta_end_dot_

 personally i d say that senator obama would be an idiot to accept this offer given that everybody knows by now that his command of oratory is more or less limited to reading an already written speech _meta_end_dot_

 the end result of him doing this would be to present the american public with the spectacle of senator obama being rhetorically clubbed like a baby harp seal the only real question is whether senator clinton would make him cry first _meta_end_dot_

 it s virtually diabolical the way this is set up in fact _meta_end_dot_

 from the elimination of the support structure that obama s depended on in his campaign to date to the careful linking of the event to one of the most well known of if not well known events in american political history this entire scenario is a trap and because it s a trap designed to puncture the far too inflated public opinion of the target senator obama has no real winning way out of this _meta_end_dot_

 accept and look the fool decline and look the coward _meta_end_dot_

 mind you in this case the coward s choice is also superficially the smart choice _meta_end_dot_

 i m figuring that they ll have him run away from this it probably won t hurt him too badly in north carolina after all _meta_end_dot_

 the problem is though that he can t run away from us in the general election _meta_end_dot_

 or rather he can except that obama s already trying to run away from his current status as a fairly typical liberal politician and the only direction away from that is smack dab into senator john mccain _meta_end_dot_

 so he might as well get it over with _meta_end_dot_

 who knows _meta_end_question_

 maybe senator clinton will get hit with a meteorite _meta_end_dot_
