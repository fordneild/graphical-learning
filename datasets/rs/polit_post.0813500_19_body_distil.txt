  update well at _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ it s _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ childers with _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ vote difference i t hink that it may not shift at this point the clarion ledger agrees with me _meta_end_dot_

 ach well better luck next time woe woe woe we re all going to die and i expect that travis childers will be endorsing barack obama for president within the next _meta_number_ref_ hours _meta_end_dot_

 only fair given all the work that his online support has given him _meta_end_dot_

 update ok at the rough halfway point _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ childers about _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ vote margin _meta_end_dot_

 good news for childers but this one may take a while _meta_end_dot_

 update with the clarion ledger reporting _meta_number_ref_ out of _meta_number_ref_ districts it s _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ childers _meta_end_dot_

 we ll see how it goes obviously _meta_end_dot_

 the greg davis and travis childers runoff this will be redone in november but people are going to be reading a lot in this one s entrails _meta_end_dot_

 results as soon as they come in and i find a good source _meta_end_dot_

 also our colleagues from the other side are going to be stopping by to try to drink our pain if it turns out that childers disassociated himself from them sufficiently so if that happens be sure to give em a good show _meta_end_dot_

 you know weeping wailing grim proclamations of how we re all going to die the usual _meta_end_dot_

 i wouldn t bother with the threats to leave the country though even they won t buy something that over the top _meta_end_dot_
