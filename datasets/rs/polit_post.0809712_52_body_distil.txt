  after i posted about the clintons becoming the _meta_dollor_ref_ million couple dan mclaughlin noted that hillary and bill took tax write offs totaling _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ million in charitable contributions _meta_end_dot_

 dan wondered if we know how many of those charities are run by bill clinton _meta_end_question_

 the answer is not exactly _meta_end_dot_

 most of the charitable contributions went to the clinton family foundation and a portion was even distributed to charitable causes _meta_end_dot_

 this is the same clinton family foundation that hillary failed to disclose as required by the ethics in government act _meta_end_dot_

 the foundation was kept off of hillary s senate disclosure forms for six years _meta_end_dot_

 the family foundation is based at the clintons chappaqua n y home _meta_end_dot_

 bill clinton serves as its president hillary clinton as secretary and treasurer and daughter chelsea as a director _meta_end_dot_

 between _meta_number_ref_ and _meta_number_ref_ the clintons put about _meta_dollor_ref_ million into the foundation _meta_end_dot_

 the clintons took a tax write off for that money even though the foundation only gave away gave away about _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ million to other charities _meta_end_dot_

 the clinton family foundation gave _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ to the mcgovern library and center for leadership and public service in mitchell s d in early _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 did that have anything to do with mcgovern s endorsement of hillary in october _meta_end_question_

 according to the post mcgovern says no_meta_beep_ref_br
