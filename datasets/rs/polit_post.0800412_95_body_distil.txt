  i have a couple of thoughts about the impact of yesterday s blowout by barack obama over primarily hillary clinton _meta_end_dot_

 the nutroots who hate clinton anyways are already touting obama s win as a new generation tak ing charge _meta_end_dot_

 and there s some logic to that _meta_end_dot_

 as if to emphasize that point hillary was standing there with madeline albright bill clinton terry mcauliffe and wesley clark all dem leaders from the _meta_number_ref_s almost a decade ago _meta_end_dot_

 the dems picked generational change and hillary is touting back to the future the establishment wants their power and they are going to fight for it _meta_end_dot_

 both the length and the brutality of the fight help the gop in november _meta_end_dot_

 more after the jump _meta_end_dot_

 this morning i talked to danny diaz the rnc s communications director and he correctly pointed out that there aren t that many differences between the democrat candidates on the major issues _meta_end_dot_

 they are all for higher taxes a huge government healthcare plan surrendering in the war on terror and defunding our troops the upshot is that the dems are going to have a long primary with two very well funded candidates _meta_end_dot_

 the clintonistas will only give up their power when it is taken from their cold dead hands _meta_end_dot_

 i mean can you imagine her losing one more race and dropping out _meta_end_question_

 they will tear up obama and he will respond tearing her up _meta_end_dot_

 and everything that they do will reinforce why democrats and independents don t like her _meta_end_dot_

 at the same time both are going to have to run to the left _meta_end_dot_

 as danny pointed out the longer it goes on and more liberal positions that they are forced to embrace the better for us in the general regardless of the question of who we face our chances in the general just got a lot better _meta_end_dot_

 in all cases the democratic base will be more split up and the candidates will be damaged by the nastiness _meta_end_dot_
