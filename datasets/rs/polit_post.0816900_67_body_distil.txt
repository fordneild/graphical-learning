  barack obama doesn t want to engage in any political stunts that s why he s not going to visit iraq to see whether his announced dogma vis vis the u s _meta_end_dot_

 strategy there run away _meta_end_exclamation_

 run away _meta_end_exclamation_

 is remotely what the doctor prescribed for success that s why he hasn t convened and will not convene his senate subcommittee responsible for overseeing nato efforts in afghanistan _meta_end_dot_

 he already knows what s best in those two countries apparently withdrawal from one and an infusion of arabic speaking farmers into the other he certainly doesn t need to see the situations there with his own eyes or attend hearings about them to hear what experts have to say _meta_end_dot_

 no matter what you say barack obama does not need to travel to iraq or learn about afghanistan to know the right courses of action in those two countries _meta_end_dot_

 how dare you suggest that he must _meta_end_question_

 he doesn t have to do what you say _meta_end_dot_

 like i said he probably won t go but may if he so chooses but if he does deign to do so it is not because anybody told him to _meta_end_dot_

 nobody s his boss big boys can tell themselves what to do _meta_end_dot_

 like i said barack obama s seriously thinking about going to iraq but again barack decides what barack does stop trying to make him do unnecessary things like actually learn facts before he makes up his mind _meta_end_exclamation_

 that s the trouble with all of you pundits and blogger types you re so darned forceful in this meddling with your betters _meta_end_dot_

 can t you learn when to sit down and shut up and listen to the consistent message that those who rule over you have been preaching _meta_end_question_

 it s always been the same your minds is where the inconsistency is _meta_end_exclamation_

 like i ve said this whole time have you been paying attention _meta_end_question_

 barack obama is promising to visit iraq and afghanistan before the november election _meta_end_dot_

 did you really think he wouldn t _meta_end_question_

 you clearly misunderestimate his capacity for caving in _meta_end_dot_
