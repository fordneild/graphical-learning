  we ll skip hillary clinton s empty and hollow victory except to note that with florida and michigan in her win column she now wants the states to send delegates to the democratic national convention _meta_end_dot_

 of course because the democratic national committee was upset at the way in which the two states scheduled their primaries they decreed that florida and michigan could not send delegates to the convention _meta_end_dot_

 other candidates agreed to this and did not campaign in florida or michigan _meta_end_dot_

 hillary clinton campaigned and won if you think that this is opportunism run amok you are probably right _meta_end_dot_

 but i guess that s the result of being driven to a near fury by barack obama _meta_end_dot_

 now to the republicans _meta_end_dot_

 my friend the great and good joshua trevino believes that mitt romney has won something of a stealth victory _meta_end_dot_

 i disagree _meta_end_dot_

 while romney did indeed capture some important demographics mccain is widely seen as the winner _meta_end_dot_

 with winning comes momentum and with momentum comes an eventual aura of inevitability as far as achieving the republican nomination is concerned _meta_end_dot_

 rudy giuliani is dropping out of the race and will endorse mccain tomorrow _meta_end_dot_

 that will give mccain even more momentum going into the debate at the reagan library _meta_end_dot_

 romney will fight on and huckabee may have some chances to make waves in a week _meta_end_dot_

 but it is mccain s to lose and i don t think he ll lose it _meta_end_dot_

 of course this means that mccain will have to prepare himself for the fight over policy in the fall _meta_end_dot_

 which also means that he will need to get himself some good ideas people concerning the issues of the day _meta_end_dot_

 i suggest megan mcardle on the issue of pharmaceuticals _meta_end_dot_

 i trust i am not getting ahead of myself here and if it needs to be said i believe that if the gop eventually selects a different nominee that person ought to allow himself to be advised by megan _meta_end_dot_

 so for that matter should the eventual democratic nominee though i understand that this would entail giving up a demagogic talking point _meta_end_dot_
