  tonight was not a failure of conservatism but a triumph of military voters who have made their home in the republican party because we are the party of a strong national defense _meta_end_dot_

 in both south carolina and florida they won it for mccain _meta_end_dot_

 in the grand coalition of the gop we ve talked about social conservatives and fiscal conservatives _meta_end_dot_

 we ve all ignored the military voters except john mccain _meta_end_dot_

 and he won them big _meta_end_dot_

 his message resonated _meta_end_dot_

 and the man still has an _meta_percent_ref_ conservative rating _meta_end_dot_

 i shed no tears _meta_end_dot_
