  not that stylized stuff that they show at the olympics _meta_end_dot_

 not even the limited contact bouts that they do in the historical reenactment societies i m talking about old school full contact italian renaissance fencing _meta_end_dot_

 bouts of that often ended with both fighters on the floor grappling each other and trying to pull knives _meta_end_dot_

 huffpo is looking for its knife _meta_end_dot_

 h t hot air read on _meta_end_dot_

 after you read byron york s old post on rove moveon org and why the latter is full of it when it piously claims that it never ever opposed the war in afghanistan _meta_end_dot_

 that little lie of theirs is not really important to this post but i thought that it probably should have been at least noted for the bs that it was _meta_end_dot_

 ok now read on _meta_end_dot_

 karl over at protein wisdom thinks that this is just huffpo trying to find some sort of atonement for their awful sin of reporting something that senator obama said that he would had never ever dared say in public _meta_end_dot_

 this is very likely true although i suspect that another part of it is merely that the progressives are finally boiling over about the utterly cynical way that the mainline democratic establishment uses them on a regular basis _meta_end_dot_

 it s no secret that the activists are barely tolerated by the professional democratic politicians they re lucky to get lip service on the issues that matter most to them _meta_end_dot_

 it s just clinton s luck that they ve finally gotten tired of it in an election year _meta_end_dot_

 whether it s good or bad luck depends on what goes down in the end _meta_end_dot_

 over at open left chris bowers has started to gently prepare the online left to the inconvenient truth that hey they re going to seat michigan and florida after all and as is via protein wisdom _meta_end_dot_

 if that happens and as bower notes obama s trolling for the mi uncommitted delegates which suggests that it s at least plausible then roughly two metric tons of commentary punditry vitriol and associated nonsense about the campaign to date suddenly becomes obsolete _meta_end_dot_

 people are now starting to talk about june being the stopping point of this campaign which means another month of full contact press for the democrats _meta_end_dot_

 and there s no reassurance for them that they ll be able to finish this off then either _meta_end_dot_

 hence huffpo s pulling out a knife _meta_end_dot_

 because the people who run this site understand something they know in the bone that if hillary clinton becomes president of the united states of america she will make absolutely certain that every group that impeded her acquisition of the nomination will pay for their presumption _meta_end_dot_

 i m fine amusingly enough so is the rest of the vrwc _meta_end_dot_

 she needs us to be the opposition _meta_end_dot_

 she doesn t need heretics _meta_end_dot_

 so if she gets the nod in denver _meta_end_dot_

 pray for a mccain victory ye leftists _meta_end_dot_

 pray most diligently to whichever god you might think would be inclined to listen _meta_end_dot_

 moe lane no that s actually a very large number _meta_percent_ref_ of that two tons is comprised of photons after all_meta_beep_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_beep_ref_i never said that i was a scientist _meta_end_dot_

 math is hard _meta_end_dot_
