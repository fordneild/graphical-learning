  dan mclaughlin one of the criticisms being made against the various permutations of a new gop agenda being circulated these days is that they are too small bore too modest and detail oriented to compete with the broad hope and change themes of barack obama s campaign _meta_end_dot_

 see patrick ruffini s critique _meta_end_dot_

 at the same time there s a school of thought that says that george w _meta_end_dot_

 bush has run into troubles in his presidency precisely when he was too ambitious whether in his promotion of democracy in iraq or his unsuccessful attempts to get congress and the public behind sweeping reforms of social security and immigration policy macro initiatives that died a death by a thousand cuts from opponents on all sides _meta_end_dot_

 critics have charged that the gop under gingrich and under bush has abandoned burkean modesty and incrementalism and bought into the rhetoric of revolution which it then predictably fails to deliver for many of the same reasons why the democrats have failed over the years to sell things like radical health care reform and gays in the military _meta_end_dot_

 with republicans likely to be playing defense on domestic policy over the next few years i ve been wondering if maybe it s time for tactical reasons to give more weight to what i think of as temperamental conservatism over ideological conservatism to argue at every turn for smaller more modest reforms as opposed to sweeping plans to junk the tax code abolish cabinet level departments etc _meta_end_dot_

 on health care for example there remains a lot of public desire for change but huge apprehension about radical change and we may well be best situated to oppose a massive plan by obama if we are offering more modest alternatives _meta_end_dot_

 so i open the floor should the gop agenda seek to reclaim the initiative of broad bold visionary choice not an echo change of the goldwater reagan gingrich variety _meta_end_question_

 or should we be positioning our party more as the party of sober adult leadership that knows the limitations of our system _meta_end_question_

 thomas crown how d that work out for the party between _meta_number_ref_ and _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_question_

 thomas crown let me add something to that much of the answer to your question depends on your goal and your perception _meta_end_dot_

 if your desire is to make a run at winning and if you believe that there s a potential majority constituency that will vote for conservative governance then you play long ball _meta_end_dot_

 you risk a blowout in either direction goldwater _meta_number_ref_ reagan _meta_number_ref_ so that you have the chance to govern _meta_end_dot_

 if you believe that there s no potential majority constituency for conservative governance but you believe there s a strong minority in favor of it or at least of its leavening effects then there is no chance to win unless you change your message to what the majority wants _meta_end_dot_

 you re then either stuck with trying to win for winning s sake divorcing the gop from conservatism or running to hold a strong minority position but never having the reins of power _meta_end_dot_

 i m simplifying interesting things like gotv donor response etc but i m doing this during part of my nominal lunch break so there _meta_end_dot_

 the problem with that second state you assume that there s no majority market for conservative governance among real actual voters who actually vote and don t just say they will is that you re not really going to win either way _meta_end_dot_

 i think the democrats are full of horse poo on most issues but they internalized goldwater s dictum pretty well with an unspoken a priori assumption if voters want a democrat for office and if you give them a watered down republican they will go with the real republican every time because they believe that the republican is at least being straight with them _meta_end_dot_

 or something _meta_end_dot_

 now of course if they want a republican you re only going to beat the republican if you re prepared to be the republican he s not _meta_end_dot_

 i would posit that this is why the gop got its rear end handed to it in _meta_number_ref_ it s not about stem cells an issue that divided the caucus or spending something the democrats do much of too or iraq or immigration or any particular issue it s because the democrats went into republican leaning districts and found democrats who sounded and presumably would act like republicans while republicans were perceived as not acting like republicans _meta_end_dot_

 but that was a win at the margins _meta_end_dot_

 they haven t won by being lefties across the board they ve won by supplementing lefties with a lot of nominal righties _meta_end_dot_

 there s a reason why kitten is running as a transcendant figure rather than the anodyne liberal he is nationally the majority market for liberalism still isn t there _meta_end_dot_

 which in turn means that for all of the tearful navel gazing in which the right has been involved these last two years the democrats haven t won and indeed probably won t at least in the only national referendum we have _meta_end_dot_

 and if they don t win that as they well realize they don t win _meta_end_dot_

 we don t either but unless they can get past a veto they re stuck _meta_end_dot_

 by contrast the alternative outcome is the republican situation from _meta_number_ref_ to _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 two count them two congresses _meta_end_dot_

 sixteen years of republican governance at the presidential level eight of which were marred by one of the most bizarre and damaging constitutional events in our history _meta_end_dot_

 a casual presumption that the democrats were the ruling party _meta_end_dot_

 the ingrained belief that government was there to solve problems at every level _meta_end_dot_

 the new deal _meta_end_dot_

 the great society _meta_end_dot_

 irreparable damage to the federal system and a judiciary it took two and a half decades to mostly clean up _meta_end_dot_

 and republicans ran as mild democrats to get there _meta_end_dot_

 i m not remotely clear that the loyal opposition either opposed anything or even slowed anything down _meta_end_dot_

 if the gop exists merely to advance the gop regardless of ideology the best tack to take is to find what the democrats are selling and sell it better _meta_end_dot_

 if it exists for some other reason we do it no service by being democrats lite _meta_end_dot_

 ben domenech i think it depends greatly on the definition _meta_end_dot_

 if temperamental conservatism means gov _meta_end_dot_

 jindal then i think it absolutely has a future _meta_end_dot_

 but jindal still packaged his adult leadership responsible reform message in a way that reached across typical political lines without sacrificing its true conservatism _meta_end_dot_

 as the nytimes points out this is a reformer who has gone from ethics and governmental reform to anti stem cell research pro voucher pro tax cut policies while hardly a group of issues that avoid headlines this isn t revolutionary new ground for conservatism _meta_end_dot_

 the packaging and the product has to correspond and it has to have an appeal that is far beyond washington s normal detail focus _meta_end_dot_

 i think that the long lists of policy proposals designed to satisfy every interest group always lose to a form of political leadership that is simple appealing easy to understand and has a message that cuts across lines of race and class _meta_end_dot_

 it comes down to here are a few ideas _meta_end_dot_

 here is why they will work and why our opponents ideas will not _meta_end_dot_

 i tend to think it s not the necessary boldness of these ideas that matter as much as finding the ones that cut across the widest range of the population _meta_end_dot_

 which is why i laugh a little bit despite ruffini s cogent analysis that the first issue on his list is earmark reform _meta_end_dot_

 ah yes that s what s holding us back _meta_end_dot_

 i think the answer to your question may be as simple as this these days it s bold to be an adult _meta_end_dot_

 thomas crown i don t think we re disagreeing perhaps i misunderstood dan s question and if so i apologize _meta_end_dot_

 i understood the question to be whether we should continue however presented with swinging for the fences or whether to botch the metaphor beyond all reason we should try to hold the democrats to a base at a time _meta_end_dot_

 dan mclaughlin what i am not suggesting we consider is let s propose a small new entitlement instead of a big one thinking _meta_end_dot_

 that way definitely leads to bob michelsville _meta_end_dot_

 what i am suggesting is more in the nature of choosing increments of progress rather than constantly going for the moon _meta_end_dot_

 let s take some examples _meta_end_dot_

 health care big proposals health savings accounts for all _meta_end_dot_

 eliminate preferential tax treatment for employer provided care _meta_end_dot_

 radical overhaul of medicare _meta_end_dot_

 small proposals allow insurance to be purchased across state lines _meta_end_dot_

 taxes scrap the tax code kill the irs _meta_end_dot_

 abolish corporate taxes _meta_end_dot_

 small proposals create an alternative optional simplified tax system _meta_end_dot_

 down the line there are more modest ways to get a foothold for conservative ideas _meta_end_dot_

 they may be the way to go right now _meta_end_dot_

 pejman yousefzadeh part of what makes it difficult to answer this question is the fact that a return to moderate temperate conservatism of the burkean variety does indeed involve bold and radical change _meta_end_dot_

 it is difficult if not impossible to overstate the effect of the advent of the welfare state and the new deal coalition _meta_end_dot_

 not only did it bring about a massive increase in the size and scope of government but it also created expectations for a continued increase in government _meta_end_dot_

 i have said it before and will say it again much of the appeal of big government is the fact that a call for governmental solutions constitute a pavlovian response to a whole host of public policy problems _meta_end_dot_

 is crime rampant _meta_end_question_

 take guns off the streets _meta_end_exclamation_

 is there a health care crisis _meta_end_question_

 make the government give us health care _meta_end_exclamation_

 is there an education crisis _meta_end_question_

 spend more money _meta_end_exclamation_

 you actually have to think to get to the small government free market solution to these problems but you can just press a button and emit a big government answer with no cogitation whatsoever _meta_end_dot_

 the appeal of that is enormous _meta_end_dot_

 the same thing by the way applies when it comes to originalist jurisprudence and fights against judicial activism _meta_end_dot_

 originalists denounce judicial activism but are themselves called activists for their desire to see a whole host of living constitution decisions reversed _meta_end_dot_

 the originalist response gets lost in the noise if you are going to return the country to a state where originalism is respected you are going to have to reverse some decisions _meta_end_dot_

 scalia of course tries to avoid this fight though he gets dragged into it by leaving a lot of precedent alone _meta_end_dot_

 but thomas gets slammed for his willingness to hold nothing sacred _meta_end_dot_

 bear in mind as well that the politics of doing something go over a lot better with the public than the politics of being the next calvin coolidge _meta_end_dot_

 that plus the need to take some actual action to return the country to a burkean state means that in order to be a burkean one must be broad bold and visionary _meta_end_dot_

 dan mclaughlin that last sentence pejman has been at the core of conservative disappointment for the last _meta_number_ref_ years _meta_end_dot_

 i m not saying we should surrender the idea of dismantling a lot of the big government machinery root and branch but it is extremely hard work politically and ends up leading us into a lot of losing battles _meta_end_dot_

 the social security fight continues to weigh heavily on my mind _meta_end_dot_

 i still think it was the right thing to do and was just abysmally mishandled by the white house in general and the communications shop in particular _meta_end_dot_

 but i also recognize that a lot of the electorate just wasn t prepared for anything that sounded like radical change to social security and if we want real change we need to be moving in a long series of increments that will build the functional constituency for each successive step _meta_end_dot_

 pejman yousefzadeh interestingly enough i think that a lot of the agenda that you laid out in your previous e mail coincides very nicely with my belief that in order to be a burkean and to return the country to a burkean state one must be broad bold and visionary _meta_end_dot_

 so i think we agree more than we disagree _meta_end_dot_

 as for the social security fight that should not have been undertaken without a crack at tax reform coming first _meta_end_dot_

 that would have been an easier or at least more electorally appealing fight and it would have had more of a chance of building up the appearance of greater political capital at the end of it _meta_end_dot_

 kevin holtsberry i fervently believe that a philosophical commitment to small government is a minority position in this country _meta_end_dot_

 conservatives succeed when they convince voters that big government hurts them through higher taxes wasted money corruption substandard service less choice etc _meta_end_dot_

 it is about effectiveness not ideology _meta_end_dot_

 liberal democrats have succeeded in convincing far too many americans that they can get government to solve huge problems while republicans have raised significant doubts about whether they can be trusted in the areas of competence and integrity _meta_end_dot_

 i think one effective way to stop or slow some of these grandiose liberal plans is to remind people just how incompetent government can be _meta_end_dot_

 we need to keep pointing out that these programs always cost more do less and have nasty unintended consequences _meta_end_dot_

 this makes us the party of realism and of prudence _meta_end_dot_

 universal health care may be well intentioned but it is the height of naivete to believe we can simply mandate it without serious problems _meta_end_dot_

 in this vein it is easy to imagine smaller proposals as a part of this recognition of the limits of government _meta_end_dot_

 thomas crown we have to convince people that incrementalism works first _meta_end_dot_

 i m not remotely convinced they know it or believe it _meta_end_dot_

 you can blame the social conservatives for a lot but a lack of voter education is not one of them _meta_end_dot_

 by contrast small government and fiscal conservatives have simply presumed despite all evidence to the contrary that everyone basically agrees with them and that there s no need to teach _meta_end_dot_

 what that leaves us is a polity that believes in big robust solutions to problems of any kind and that if we effect a half measure today we ll just have to go all the way later so why not just speed things up _meta_end_question_

 the enormous disproportionate cost of these huge responses and the human misery and cost that we have to endure before during and after we fix them is lost on most _meta_end_dot_

 hence the demand for universal health care but it ll be different from canada and britain the massive soul deadening effects of the welfare state for example were largely not seen as connected to welfare except at a gut level that most folks won t voice for fear of being called racist and any attempt to solve the former by fixing the latter ran into enormous opposition that took thirty years millions of lives and god alone knows how much money to overcome _meta_end_dot_

 and that s about the only successful education effort on government largesse i can think of made possible in large part by middle class reactions to inner city crime some good stinginess and decades of work by the conservative movement _meta_end_dot_

 the lessons from that have not precisely made it into the population at large _meta_end_dot_

 robert a _meta_end_dot_

 hahn we can implement a small government agenda and appeal to the expectations for government solutions segment at the same time _meta_end_dot_

 we do it by stealing an idea from bill clinton and taking advantage of the fact that the problems people want solutions for are always changing _meta_end_dot_

 bill clinton had a new government program every week _meta_end_dot_

 but they were nits _meta_end_dot_

 he d learned his lesson about big sweeping reforms with gaysinthemilitary and letmywifereformhealthcare _meta_end_dot_

 he replaced those with symbolism over substance _meta_end_dot_

 put _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ cops on the street sounds good costs little _meta_end_dot_

 and it expired in two years leaving the cities with the problem of keeping the salaries funded after that _meta_end_dot_

 clinton had lots of programs that were funded to the tune of five or ten million over ten years _meta_end_dot_

 clinton to spend _meta_dollor_ref_ million on smiles for children clinton to spend _meta_dollor_ref_ million on happiness for the handicapped it was a headline a day on the cheap _meta_end_dot_

 we could do that while quietly making other things go away _meta_end_dot_

 our problem has been a one way cut government approach _meta_end_dot_

 we want to kill barney and big bird _meta_end_dot_

 we never have a _meta_dollor_ref_ million over _meta_number_ref_ years program to talk about at the same time _meta_end_dot_

 this allows the media to crucify us as a bunch of meanies _meta_end_dot_

 instead we could be buying _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ ballpoint pens for the chill run _meta_end_dot_
