  one of the more silly arguments used to show that a certain person has supposedly acted unethically is to say that while said person s actions may have complied with the letter of the law they have somehow violated the spirt of the law _meta_end_dot_

 mind you it is entirely possible for someone to comply with the letter of the law while violating the spirit of it but too often such an argument is used simply as a desperation ploy _meta_end_dot_

 the target of the accusation has not been helpful in giving his her accuser s anything substantial to shoot at so the accuser s use the spirit of the law claim to find unethical behavior where none may exist _meta_end_dot_

 for an example of this see this story _meta_end_dot_

 it finds that john mccain used a corporate jet owned by a company headed up by his wife _meta_end_dot_

 the story acknowledges the following times decides to change the rules of the game the law allows mccain to do what he is doing _meta_end_dot_

 there is no spirit of the law being violated _meta_end_dot_

 and buried further down in the story is a grudging admission by the times that mccain did not take advantage of other portions of the law that would have ensured that he never would have experienced any kind of financial crisis whatsoever such as tapping his wife s funds to finance his campaign the same way that john kerry did when he ran in _meta_number_ref_ and the same way that mitt romney and hillary clinton did with respect to their own fortunes _meta_end_dot_

 gosh did mccain respect the spirit of the law by refraining from touching his wife s funds or asking her to tap into them even though he supposedly violated the spirit of the law by using a campaign jet entirely in keeping with the law _meta_end_question_

 i recognize of course that it is quite the journalistic scoop to somehow show that mr _meta_end_dot_

 campaign finance reform is not acting in accordance with the ethics behind the laws he has passed and has sought to pass _meta_end_dot_

 but really there is no excuse whatsoever for having written this story _meta_end_dot_

 it has no legs _meta_end_dot_

 it never had any legs _meta_end_dot_

 and no amount of spirit will give it any legs _meta_end_dot_
