  the washington post has declined to review doug feith s war and decision _meta_end_dot_

 on the grounds that tom ricks and karen deyoung wrote about book on march _meta_number_ref_th the paper feels it has been given sufficient coverage in its august pages _meta_end_dot_

 the post is apparently not concerned that ricks and deyoung had their unedited manuscript of an embargoed book of some _meta_number_ref_ pages excluding notes and appendices by their own admission for less than six hours before they went to press and that in the course of these six hours they conducted interviews with feith and bremer and wrote their article as well as quickly flipping through it for the juicy bits a hectic schedule that explains why their piece ignores large segments of the book and does not mention any of the material feith publishes for the first time they condemn the book as including surprisingly little new information _meta_end_dot_

 this is no matter to the editor of the post s book world _meta_end_dot_

 that article is good enough for the likes of war and decision _meta_end_dot_

 it counts as their formal review and there is simply no room for further consideration it would be too repetitious _meta_end_dot_

 after all the post has its standards _meta_end_dot_

 or does it _meta_end_question_

 read on _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 given the post s position on reviewing the book it is somewhat surprising that the paper found ample column inches for dana milbank who attended a csis panel discussion on war and decision last night to rip into feith in a petty and vindictive screed _meta_end_dot_

 the premise of his piece appears to be that feith is stupid delusional or actually unhinged all points that would make milbank s readers less than likely to read war and decision and more likely to accept the central thesis of milbank s work which is that the iraq war is evil wrong and hopeless and so are those that participated in the policy _meta_end_dot_

 had milbank looked beyond the front cover of the book he bought last night he doesn t like the color by the way he might have a better understanding of war and decision _meta_end_dot_

 had he only flipped it over he would have found blurbs by the likes of henry kissinger and jean edward smith both of whom have been critical of feith s policies but found so much of substance in the book that they lent their names in support of it _meta_end_dot_

 their presence on the cover suggests that this is no empty self serving polemic as milbank claims and might entice a more curious soul to actually open the book and judge it by what lies therein _meta_end_dot_

 furthermore had milbank been paying attention in last night s panel he would know that feith has created a supporting website for war and decision where interested readers can find links to the documents and articles feith sites in his footnotes _meta_end_dot_

 by proffering his sources feith encourages the public to access the primary record and follow me closely here make up their own minds about the issues he addresses in the book _meta_end_dot_

 this is hardly the act of a someone desperate to spin and avoid blame _meta_end_dot_

 it is the act of someone who wants to provoke serious discussion of the historical record _meta_end_dot_

 perhaps most shamefully milbank tries to undermine the book by belittling feith s decision to donate the proceeds from war and decision to a military charity _meta_end_dot_

 he says this is an empty gesture because of course money is not the object in this book the _meta_number_ref_ year old son of a holocaust survivor is eager to rebuild a reputation that continues to suffer for his role in starting the war of course _meta_end_dot_

 the double whammy from ricks deyoung and milbank along with the decision not to have the post waste any time having someone actually read the book for review leads to unsavory conclusions _meta_end_dot_

 war and decision is only of interest when the post can do a pre emptive strike aimed at dissuading people from reading it _meta_end_dot_

 it s the editorial equivalent of announcing there s nothing of interest here _meta_end_dot_

 move along folks the post seems so eager to bury this book you would almost think they were afraid of it _meta_end_dot_

 gee is the truth really so scary _meta_end_question_
