  listen to this amazing claim about delaware sb _meta_number_ref_ known as the single payer health security act information sheet on the bill written by a dr _meta_end_dot_

 floyd mcdowell who is apparently the act s contact resource issue area facilitator _meta_end_dot_

 read on _meta_end_dot_

 unfortunately such a claim is fallacious at best _meta_end_dot_

 now i could go on and on here about how and why that s simply not possible however rather than spending time explaining why i m happy to send you over to the delaware libertarian who has dug up some pretty good well not to proponents of sb _meta_number_ref_ data on the topic which demonstrate that single payer health plans do not eliminate the need for out of pocket expenditures the delaware libertarian has done and according to the above linked post will be doing a good deal of work to lay out the case that the costs of this program will spiral out of control from the outset while the quality of medical care available to our citizens takes a nose dive click on over and check it out _meta_end_dot_

 oh and while you re there check out this post on how the no money out of your pocket ever meme is made possible by the fact that money will instead be taken out of every delawar ian _meta_end_question_

 ite s paycheck to the tune of _meta_number_ref_ _meta_percent_ref_ to pay for the program _meta_end_dot_

 the state government is probably banking on nobody noticing new taxes taken out before the great unwashed receive their paychecks _meta_end_dot_

 sadly they may be right _meta_end_dot_
