  this is a special message for those conservatives out there who have even the slightest doubt that we all need to band together for the political fight this year _meta_end_dot_

 are you angry at john mccain _meta_end_question_

 then you re angry at the wrong man _meta_end_dot_

 look before you forget while we re chasing our own tails worrying about the perfect candidate our opponents are still there _meta_end_dot_

 they have no principles no consciences and will feel no remorse about doing and saying whatever it takes to achieve political victory in november _meta_end_dot_

 read on and take a look at the latest example here s a video put out by some supporters of senator barack obama i hesitate to give it any air but i think it must be seen to get the impact _meta_end_dot_

 here we have the propaganda for the masses take a funny little video and sneak in a great big lie _meta_end_dot_

 if you count on your base being undereducated enough to believe the lie then you win big _meta_end_dot_

 we do now know what the big lie will be in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 in _meta_number_ref_ the lie was that republicans will start drafting young men and women to fight and die in iraq _meta_end_dot_

 it was absurd there was no support for the notion in government outside of a few radical democrats _meta_end_dot_

 the republican house of representatives even overwhelmingly voted down representative charlie rangel s proposal _meta_end_dot_

 but they told the lie anyway over and over knowing that far too many democrats and democratic leaners are just too dumb not to fall for it _meta_end_dot_

 in _meta_number_ref_ the lie is that we ll be fighting and dying in iraq forever with the death toll mounting without end should john mccain be elected president _meta_end_dot_

 as proof of this they show mccain saying that he s fine with the us being in iraq for that long _meta_end_dot_

 what s the catch _meta_end_question_

 we all know that s not what he means _meta_end_dot_

 educated democrats even know that s not what he means _meta_end_dot_

 those of us who ve studied history and follow politics all know that mccain envisions us building a partnership of peace and prosperity with iraq the way we have successfully with south korea japan and germany _meta_end_dot_

 there s no more reason to fear a lengthy stay in iraq any more than we gnash our teeth at our perpetual deployments in those countries but they tell the lie anyway _meta_end_dot_

 barack obama s supporters tell this lie anyway the same way democrats tell the big lie every time because they know full well that their target audience will fall for it _meta_end_dot_

 they feel no shame in using false pretenses to win the presidency _meta_end_dot_

 can any right thinking person stand aside and let this travesty go unchallenged _meta_end_question_

 i hope not _meta_end_dot_

 we must join together and defeat these liars to the last man _meta_end_dot_

 barack obama s big lie must be destroyed _meta_end_dot_

 his fairy tales must be burned to the ground and scattered into the winds _meta_end_dot_

 we must not let them get away with this _meta_end_dot_

 nothing john mccain has ever done is more important than that _meta_end_dot_
