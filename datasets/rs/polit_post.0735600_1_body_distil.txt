  isn t this charming _meta_end_question_

 warning link not safe for civilized society _meta_end_dot_

 think of the site it leads to as the ebola virus of the blogosphere once we get past the gibbering absurd and childish hatefest the author luxuriates in we ve all dropped the f bomb from time to time but after the _meta_number_ref_th or _meta_number_ref_th grade we recognized that there is you know a limit to how much you can do that kind of thing before you make clear to others that you have completely lost whatever command you ever had of the english language we see that the author is deeply deeply ever so deeply upset about the belief that the people with the best accountants in the country send the lowest percentage of their income to the irs those people are of course the very rich according to the author s assertions backed up by a campaigning warren buffett _meta_end_dot_

 i am sure that one can engage buffett in a rational conversation _meta_end_dot_

 concerning jezebel one has to assume that there isn t a sand castle s chance in an earthquake that he she it can grasp a complicated argument but if one looks at this post and this one one sees surprise that the people with the best accountants in the country in fact bear the overwhelming burden of federal taxes _meta_end_dot_

 all of this is of course quite obvious to any sentient person with even a rudimentary understanding of contemporaneous tax burdens _meta_end_dot_

 and this episode should be considered a teaching event the next time that loud mouthed jezebels want to write posts that look like they were written by a kindergartener with tourette s syndrome they ought to do their homework first _meta_end_dot_

 not that they will of course _meta_end_dot_

 doing homework requires brain cells after all _meta_end_dot_
