  yesterday jim johnson stepped down from barack obama s vp selection committee _meta_end_dot_

 it turned out that he had received potentially improper loans from countrywide financial which obama had attacked _meta_end_dot_

 but it turns out that johnson isn t the only sketchy person on the vp selection committee _meta_end_dot_

 i would like to introduce you to eric holder bill clinton s former deputy attorney general _meta_end_dot_

 holder was involved in the pardon of marc rich the democratic donor who had fled the country _meta_end_dot_

 in march of _meta_number_ref_ the nyt wrote about the case _meta_end_dot_

 they make it clear that holder is awash in cronyism skirts ethics laws had horrible judgement and is simply incompetent _meta_end_dot_

 he also advocated for clemency for terrorists _meta_end_dot_

 and this is obama s primary advisor on his first decision as the democratic nominee _meta_end_dot_

 read on for details _meta_end_dot_

 from the nyt why quinn _meta_end_question_

 well the favor factory was in play there was one little catch _meta_end_dot_

 it was illegal for quinn to lobby meaning that as deputy attorney general he recommended someone for a job that they could not legally do to curry favor with that person dick morris reminds us that rich was quite well connceted so quinn and rich start shopping the idea around _meta_end_dot_

 first they don t go through holder instead goind directly to the white house _meta_end_dot_

 in a meeting on the subject clinton rejects for the good reason that rich sold weapons to our enemies so quinn heads back to holder and tries again _meta_end_dot_

 what does holder do _meta_end_question_

 he falls asleep at the wheel when presented with a pardon request for a known felon who fled the country and who was believed to be an international arms dealer _meta_end_dot_

 how did that happen _meta_end_question_

 obama s vetter didn t vet because he must really have wanted quinn s help with his next job _meta_end_dot_

 so this is the change obama brings _meta_end_dot_

 warmed over shady operators from the clinton administration _meta_end_dot_

 these guys do favors for each other for jobs _meta_end_dot_

 they give favored access to donors _meta_end_dot_

 they skirt around ethics rules _meta_end_dot_

 and they don t do their jobs _meta_end_dot_

 oh yeah _meta_end_dot_

 and he argued that members of a terrorist organization should get clemency _meta_end_dot_

 this isn t a hypothetical _meta_end_dot_

 this is the change that obama is bringing to washington right now _meta_end_dot_

 this is the guy that obama is putting in charge of his first major decision after his previous choice was found to be ethically flawed _meta_end_dot_
