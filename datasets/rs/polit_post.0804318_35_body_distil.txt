  as we have noted already the opposition to retroactive telecom immunity in fisa has been gutshot_meta_beep_ref_ dodd s amendment died _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ specter s amendment likewise died _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ and the cloture movement passed _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 they ll now go reconcile the bill with the house version which translates to as the speaker of the house will cave and do what we tell her this is of course not surprising to anyone with a functioning cerebral cortex they delayed this long frankly to allow democrats to duck the issue until after super tuesday _meta_end_dot_

 which is why it s so amusing that senator obama didn t take the hint _meta_end_dot_

 read _meta_end_dot_

 oh before i forget we shouldn t have won this one _meta_end_dot_

 the reason that we did is because the netroots failed _meta_end_dot_

 if only you d been better people you might have found victory _meta_end_dot_

 you re not worthy enough to deserve to win though _meta_end_dot_

 just wanted to make sure that we were clear on that and yes i am laughing at you right now _meta_end_dot_

 read on _meta_end_dot_

 the coward of course is senator hillary clinton who rather cynically ducked out of both votes instead of either enraging her base by voting for telecom immunity or else causing problems for her general election campaign by allowing voted against tracking terrorists trying to kill you advertisements to show up at the end of say september _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 nobody loves an equivocator and this is pretty much the same cautious trimming that we ve grown to expect from the junior senator from ny _meta_end_dot_

 granted it will work once this bill is passed it will fall under the radar of the _meta_percent_ref_ of the population that doesn t obsess over politics but it s still not what you d call a profile in courage _meta_end_dot_

 and if clinton supporters are upset that i m calling her careful disassociation from the frothing wing of her party i would remind you that the woman did her part to encourage the creation of said frothing wing in the first place _meta_end_dot_

 the least that she could do would be to confront it every now and then _meta_end_dot_

 and then we have the hypocrite _meta_end_dot_

 senator barack obama _meta_end_dot_

 if you don t like hypocrite i suppose that you could substitute the phrase baldfaced liar not because he voted against telecom immunity mind you it s a perfectly natural position for a doctrinaire down the line liberal who s pandering to the hardcore democratic base to take _meta_end_dot_

 the problem is barack obama s currently pretending to be something else right now _meta_end_dot_

 he s supposed to be this wonderful breath of fresh air that s going to change politics and bring everyone together remember _meta_end_question_

 at least that s what he says _meta_end_dot_

 what he invariably does is things precisely like this take up positions that s well to the left even by the standards of his own party _meta_end_dot_

 now whether or not you think that the right middle is correct about telecom immunity is actually irrelevant to this discussion the fact is we obviously think that it s correct and while we re interested in having a discussion on the topic and fisa in general it must be a discussion not another endlessly tiresome lecture about how we must do the bidding of the left on this and every other issue _meta_end_dot_

 fortunately the left hasn t learned this yet which is why they re always losing these policy battles and why so many of them support a candidate who seems to be under the impression that bringing people together means a vote for me is a vote for the forgiveness of your sins while this seems to be working quite well for obama in the primaries well more accurately the caucuses the primaries are proving to be a bit of a slog_meta_beep_ref_ it won t work in the general _meta_end_dot_

 this is all a wash for me anyway i figure that we have a slightly better shot at the presidency with obama but we ll regain more seats in the house with clinton _meta_end_dot_

 i just enjoy giving my opinion secure in the knowledge that nobody who shouldn t from my perspective listen to me will listen to me _meta_end_dot_

 i enjoyed doing it in _meta_number_ref_ over and over and over again but i really did think that people would learn better this go round _meta_end_dot_

 yes yes i know silly neocon _meta_end_dot_

 moe and if i might note in passing _meta_end_question_

 i really really hope that none of you spent too much time and or money being part of that opposition because i spent very little of either helping to make sure that it passed _meta_end_dot_

 need to that s why _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_beep_ref_i say that knowing that obama s posed to win dc md va today _meta_end_dot_

 he would have traded any one of the latter two for ma and both for ca _meta_end_dot_
