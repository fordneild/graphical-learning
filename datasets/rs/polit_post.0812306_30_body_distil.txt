  you have to wonder whether these are rhetorical questions coming from daniel henninger or at least questions that can be answered by perusing the data found here _meta_end_dot_

 but then again possibly not _meta_end_dot_

 read on _meta_end_dot_

 jim geraghty s two links one to marc ambinder and one to robert novak suggest one possibility _meta_end_dot_

 noting the somewhat different accounts ambinder gives tuesday morning as being the point where obama was really apprised of the wright meltdown novak suggests that damage control started on monday geraghty states and that in fact may be the answer to the larger question _meta_end_dot_

 while henninger is correct to state that even at the crudest level of political calculation and cowardice there s a point in a presidential race when a candidate s supporters are all in it s not surprising that those supporters may be a touch reluctant to simply barge in _meta_end_dot_

 it s even arguably legitimate a situation like this can easily be made worse by the over enthusiastic help of a supporter with no message discipline which come to think of it describes the original problem _meta_end_dot_

 probably best to let the campaign itself tell you what help it needs _meta_end_dot_

 note campaign not candidate this isn t an attack if a candidate could run for office successfully without a staff no candidate would use one _meta_end_dot_

 they can t so they do and thus it is the responsibility of the staff to do all the things that the candidate would do if only he or she had the situational awareness or the time to do them _meta_end_dot_

 what this all leads up to is that while you can repair the damage done by crises like these you can repair the damage caused by almost anything you will need good coordination and that means good staff work _meta_end_dot_

 and if the staff is not up to handling an emergency situation it is entirely possible that it is also not up to handling even the most obvious forms of damage control _meta_end_dot_

 put another way possibly nobody thought to actually circle the wagons _meta_end_dot_

 if true this is actually good news for the obama campaign it means that he merely has to fire his staff instead of his democratic establishment supporters _meta_end_dot_

 trying to do the latter rarely ends well _meta_end_dot_

 moe lane this assumes of course that the staff is even aware of those forms _meta_end_dot_

 the obama campaign seems to attract the type of political operative who opposes the current ways of doing politics whether or not they have realized that there may be good pragmatic reasons for those ways is undetermined although i have my suspicions _meta_end_dot_

 there are going to be a lot of books written about the _meta_number_ref_ election _meta_end_dot_
