 on mtp dnc boss howard dean showed why he is still relevant to today s political discussion _meta_end_dot_

 not really _meta_end_dot_

 he said that michigan and florida did not play by the rules and if they were permitted in the process they would be cutting in line and there would be a riot _meta_end_dot_

 he said though that it was all up to the dems rules committee _meta_end_dot_

 he later said that he would seat their delegations and that president bush was not interested in capturing osama bin laden _meta_end_dot_

 on ftn obama strategist david axelrod called certain things said by bill clinton regrettable but excused him for saying things to get his wife elected _meta_end_dot_

 hillary s mouthpiece howard wolfson argued that this ongoing fight has been great for the democratic party as it has driven democrats to the polls _meta_end_dot_

 on le dianne feinstein and pete hoekstra blamed bush _meta_end_dot_

 a lot _meta_end_dot_

 read the review of the shows beneath the fold obama on fns _meta_end_dot_

 on fox news sunday host chris wallace talked to democrat barack obama _meta_end_dot_

 wallace began by asking about obama s inability to win white working class voters and obama pointed out that they are more familiar with hillary but will vote for him in the general election _meta_end_dot_

 he offered that he had won those voters in iowa and wisconsin _meta_end_dot_

 of voters obama explained they re looking for someone who can solve their problems he offered if i lose the general election race will not be an issue wallace played a clip of jeremiah wright telling bill moyers that he has been treated unfairly that he is a victim _meta_end_dot_

 obama said that wright was not the victim people are legitimately angry at some of wright s comments _meta_end_dot_

 the snippets of wright s sermons taken from a thirty year career were unfair _meta_end_dot_

 barry doesn t like civilians like wright being dragged into these political fights he emphasized that wright is a former pastor of mine obama said that martin luther king jr _meta_end_dot_

 had sermons which were just as harsh as were wright s it s a generational thing he explained having to do with having faced jim crow laws _meta_end_dot_

 wallace asked him about the flag lapel pin _meta_end_dot_

 barry responded i ve worn flag pins in the past i will wear them in the future wallace asked him about his equating of billy ayers and senator tom coburn _meta_end_dot_

 obama explained that he was not comparing them rather he was making the point that you can work with someone without agreeing with all of their views _meta_end_dot_

 for instance he worked with tom coburn with whose positions on abortion he disagreed _meta_end_dot_

 i wish he d have used the adverb violently but alas he did not he pointed out that what ayers had done was forty years in the past and ayers is leading a different life now _meta_end_dot_

 wallace did not ask him about his comments to the new york times published on september _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ that he didn t think he had done enough damage with his bombs and would gladly bomb again _meta_end_dot_

 wallace said that obama had been portraying himself as a uniter so when would he unite with republicans _meta_end_question_

 obama answered that he liked their stand on regulations in that they should not be a governmentally designed set of rules but a set of mandates with business deciding how best to meet them _meta_end_dot_

 wallace pointed out that obama has not moved to the center in the past and obama blamed the way republicans phrased their bills allowing no middle ground _meta_end_dot_

 as proof of his moderation obama proudly proclaimed that though he voted against the nomination of john roberts to be chief justice of the united states supreme court he had defended his colleagues who had supported roberts _meta_end_dot_

 obama told wallace that he would ignore general david petraeus s requests to stay in iraq and finish the job rather obama said he would set a timetable for surrender and demand that petraeus implement it _meta_end_dot_

 obama deliberately refused to answer the question of whether he would accept hillary as a running mate _meta_end_dot_

 obama said the democratic party would be unified even if hillary wins the nomination _meta_end_dot_

 surrogates on tw _meta_end_dot_

 on abc s this week host george stephanopoulos had a four person panel tom daschle and artur davis for barry evan bayh and sheila jackson lee for hillary _meta_end_dot_

 it was standard far but very mild _meta_end_dot_

 no fights _meta_end_dot_

 daschle said that the delegates would select the nominee and lee said that the greatest thing for the american people would be for the dem race to continue and everyone have a chance to vote _meta_end_dot_

 stephanopoulos declared that race was an issue amongst pennsylvania s white blue collar democrats _meta_end_dot_

 bayh said that hillary had a way to cut the gas taxes while hilary did not _meta_end_dot_

 lee argued that this campaign is about issues and that hillary will help their pocketbooks she said that the big tent lived in the dem party can t we all get along _meta_end_question_

 the answer is yes davis said that while he respected the clintons and all that they ve done they have pissed away their legacy by arguing that barry is not electable _meta_end_dot_

 note it sounded to me as if he said that the clintons have pissed away their legacy and it is fun to think so but i heard it only once and have not seen a transcript howard dean on mtp _meta_end_dot_

 on nbc s meet the press host tim russert interviewed the increasingly irrelevant dnc boss howard dean _meta_end_dot_

 russert wanted to know how is it going to be resolved in the spirit of unity it s not tim _meta_end_dot_

 too bad dr _meta_end_dot_

 dean said that he hoped this would all be over by the end of june they need to figure this out before the convention _meta_end_dot_

 we need time to heal he asserted that it took him three months to convince his supporters to back john kerry _meta_end_dot_

 russert played a clip of ed rendell saying that popular vote should choose the nominee not the elected delegates as the elected delegates were chosen unfairly dean disagrees and he says that though ed might not like the rule he has to live by them _meta_end_dot_

 dean called john mccain a weak candidate dean predicted that the candidate who is deemed most likely to win in november would get the nomination _meta_end_dot_

 he rejected russert s language asserting that superdelegates could overrule the elected delegates _meta_end_dot_

 he argued that most of the superdelegates have to face the electorate _meta_end_dot_

 russert asked if and dean answered that the elected delegates represented the will of the people he also believes the superdelegates represent the will of the people _meta_end_dot_

 dean said that the calculus for the voters in indiana will be who can beat john mccain _meta_end_question_

 in north carolina dean tacitly believes that race will be the deciding factor _meta_end_dot_

 dean said that americans care more about the issues than they do about the process within the democratic party _meta_end_dot_

 dean said that americans want change and they cannot get change without a different party controlling the white house russert suggested that black americans would defect if hillary were given the nomination _meta_end_dot_

 dean said that he wouldn t answer a hypothetical and claimed that we don t divide people dean said that the party had to united in the end and that the person most important to that will be the one who doesn t win with regards to michigan and florida doesn t know what the rules committee will do but they have to respect the rules he added michigan and florida are very important states but that doesn t mean they are more important than anybody else he likened the situation to having a line full of people waiting for something if two people try to jump the line go to the front it s not long before you re going to have a riot a riot predicts dean _meta_end_dot_

 dean said that he is determined to seat michigan and florida in some way howard dean said that george bush is not interested in catching osama bin laden _meta_end_dot_

 howard dean is a loony _meta_end_dot_

 on all levels _meta_end_dot_

 wolfson and axelroad on ftn _meta_end_dot_

 over at cbs face the nation host bob schieffer jawboned with hillary s mouthpiece howard wolfson and barry s strategist david axelrod _meta_end_dot_

 schieffer s stated them was is this campaign harming the dem party _meta_end_question_

 a racial divide _meta_end_question_

 schieffer opened by quoting congressman james clyburn about how the clinton s are trying to damage obama so badly that he cannot beat mccain _meta_end_dot_

 wolfson said that he disagreed with clymer but that this contest has been great for the dems due to the record turnout _meta_end_dot_

 he said that when this is finished they ll come together as a party _meta_end_dot_

 axelrod responded well in many ways i agree with howard he said that we need change and we need to move forward _meta_end_dot_

 he doesn t think hillary is campaigning hard because she wants to damage barry in the fall _meta_end_dot_

 schieffer pointed out the racial age and economic divides _meta_end_dot_

 he posited that they both need each other and will have to put the other on the ticket _meta_end_dot_

 wolfson said that there are lots of contests remaining and it is premature to talk about a ticket _meta_end_dot_

 wolfson said the divide is not unusual as there are two strong candidates with passionate supporters _meta_end_dot_

 schieffer asked axelrod how a dem could win in november without working class voters _meta_end_dot_

 axelrod said that barry is winning those voters _meta_end_dot_

 schieffer said that both surrogates claim that their candidate can bring the various elements together but neither has _meta_end_dot_

 axelrod predicted that people across the country will come together in a coalition for change wolfson questioned whether or not obama could win the blue collar voters as he couldn t win them in ohio or pennsylvania despite his outspending hillary _meta_end_dot_

 axelrod said that hillary was going to lose them anyway his goal in pennsylvania he said was to reduce her margin to single digits which he said she did _meta_end_dot_

 schieffer brought up bill clinton challenging his reputation as a masterful politician because of his campaign hijinx _meta_end_dot_

 note that s the press _meta_end_dot_

 i ve never thought clinton anything more than a political oaf with a winning smile wolfson said that the media has treated bill unfairly _meta_end_dot_

 axelrod said that some of the things bill said were regrettable but that he was just trying to get hillary elected _meta_end_dot_

 he said that people bill clinton should think before they speak _meta_end_dot_

 axelrod argued that jeremiah wright did not say that barry was just another politician he called wright an unwilling participant in this campaign and that there is more to this story than we saw in the moyers thing he argued that wright had lived out the prophetic word axelrod said that it is up to the voters whether or not to hold obama accountable for was wright has said in pennsylvania he argued he was held accountable to what obama himself had said _meta_end_dot_

 feinstein and hoekstra on le _meta_end_dot_

 blitzer opened his cnn show late edition by talking with senator dianne feinstein and representative pete hoekstra _meta_end_dot_

 it s syria stuff why did bush wait _meta_number_ref_ months to tell us about the syrian nuke facility taken out by israel _meta_end_question_

 wolf asked feinstein if she really believed bush s assertion that north korea and syria were cooperating on nukes _meta_end_dot_

 feinstein replied that she had been briefed that the facility was not for civilian use and she faulted the president for not alerting the iaea _meta_end_dot_

 she believes the experts that this was a nuclear facility _meta_end_dot_

 blitzer pointed out to hoekstra bush s credibility problem based on colin powell s bogus presentation to the un on iraq _meta_end_dot_

 hoekstra believes that the information is solid but he faulted bush for not briefing him seven months ago _meta_end_dot_

 and it should have gone to mohammed el baradei and the iaea _meta_end_dot_

 blitzer played a clip from the syrian ambassador saying that the facility was just a vacant building and the administration was lying about it just as they had with iraq _meta_end_dot_

 blitzer wanted to know why the administration did not contact the iaea and neither hoekstra nor feinstein said that they knew _meta_end_dot_

 feinstein thinks the administration is sending some kind of message to the norks by releasing the information now _meta_end_dot_

 she thinks that if the bush had told her about this seven months ago they could have taken care of this problem _meta_end_dot_

 now she asserted it could blow up blitzer quoted from the new york times reporting that republican hardliners are trying to thwart an agreement which would close down north korea s nuclear program _meta_end_dot_

 hoekstra wants to know if north korea is proliferating nuclear technology to anyone else _meta_end_dot_

 he asserted that he could have known this if bush had been more open _meta_end_dot_

 he said that the israelis did the right thing by taking out this facility _meta_end_dot_

 feinstein agreed _meta_end_dot_

 feinstein called on bush to start negotiating with iraq not with ahmadinejad but with the supreme council who actually run the country _meta_end_dot_

 hoekstra thought we should reach out to iran but only with russia and our allies _meta_end_dot_

 they both thought that going in militarily would be a huge mistake difi has great respect for president carter but she wishes that he hadn t met with hamas _meta_end_dot_

 she said it looks like a rolling marble on the deck of a ship hoekstra said that it shows how weak this president is that a former president can pretend to do his work _meta_end_dot_

 hoekstra will face a reelection battle in michigan s cd _meta_number_ref_ between either kimon kotos or fred johnson and that s that _meta_end_dot_

 have at it _meta_end_exclamation_
