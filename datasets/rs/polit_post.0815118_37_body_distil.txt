  come i will hide nothing from you i am a geek _meta_end_dot_

 yes many of you are shocked given that i hide it so well but no i have the obligatory shelves of science fiction and fantasy novels steampunk comic books and roleplaying game supplements _meta_end_dot_

 i construct alternate history maps for fun _meta_end_dot_

 i dress up in medieval clothing on weekends and go watch people in armor hit each other with wooden sticks _meta_end_dot_

 my other major online hobby is writing amateur gaming material for a system that involves angels vs _meta_end_dot_

 demons usually with gratuitous automatic weapons fire involved _meta_end_dot_

 in short i am what this man good naturedly lampooned and self lampooned _meta_end_dot_

 i m mentioning all of this because otherwise you might not get why i found this particular washington times piece so funny they re not the only ones of course _meta_end_dot_

 read on _meta_end_dot_

 john fund of the wall street journal writes in the same vein albeit with less allegations of overt supernatural intervention while funny and the rnc is keeping track of obama s other mistakes this week by the way all of this is also relevant because it reveals a somewhat significant and potentially disastrous problem faced by the obama campaign excessive cockiness _meta_end_dot_

 note that i didn t limit that to senator obama himself _meta_end_dot_

 his staff is just as susceptible to the condition _meta_end_dot_

 to be fair they ve had a good run so far _meta_end_dot_

 their manipulation of the democratic primary was impressive from a power gamer s perspective the combination of red state caucus manipulation clever encouragement of progressive liberal white guilt and full court co opting of the african american voting bloc has put them in a position where they are the current front runner even though the only first rank blue state that obama has actually won so far has been his home state of illinois _meta_end_dot_

 or as this rather crude map demonstrates blue for clinton red for obama black for red states in _meta_number_ref_ while he s ahead in the count it s because his strategy emphasized say north dakota over massachusetts or nebraska over california or any other combination that you like _meta_end_dot_

 again a very clever primary strategy if he tries it in the general he ll get hammered across the board of course but that s another issue _meta_end_dot_

 unfortunately it may have been too clever a strategy because it s encouraging his supporters and increasingly the candidate himself to think that he s invincible _meta_end_dot_

 the reality actual objective reality right now is that the obama campaign is in a little bit of trouble _meta_end_dot_

 they are currently behind in the head to head polls there is a large stretch of the traditionally democratic rust belt that is increasingly looking like specifically anti obama territory and his primary opponent is well aware of both of those facts _meta_end_dot_

 worse for him he cannot hope to have his primary opponent quit he has to make her quit somehow _meta_end_dot_

 or the democratic party does _meta_end_dot_

 obama would very much like to declare victory next week once the remaining two mountain west states are in but even if he does he still needs to have clinton admit to it _meta_end_dot_

 if she doesn t and goes after the super delegates full throttle obama will have to spend the rest of the summer fighting her off before the convention _meta_end_dot_

 it ll take place mostly under the radar but as long as clinton s still swinging the contest is still in doubt so it s in his best interests to get her to stop swinging which implies a certain delicate touch from him his campaign and his supporters _meta_end_dot_

 pause do i really need to provide links to the general tone that obama supporters are directing towards clinton supporters and vice versa right now _meta_end_question_

 because a random sampling of huffpo dkos taylor marsh talkleft politico and any major newspaper s pet blogs could provide enough anger resentment and hate to fuel a sith lord _meta_end_dot_

 and it s mostly the obama supporters fault or rather the failure for it to stop is the obama supporters responsibility _meta_end_dot_

 the general impression that one gets is that the progressives that are pretty much representing the public face of obama s campaign these days are so ecstatic that they finally have the upper hand over somebody that they ve collectively forgotten that they ll actually need later the people that they re attacking now _meta_end_dot_

 or that just because obama supporters have nowhere else to go that doesn t actually mean that neither do clinton supporters _meta_end_dot_

 which leads us back to hubris at least our modern definition of it which isn t the same as the one the ancient greeks used _meta_end_dot_

 the next few weeks will be very interesting either clinton will drop out which will probably add even more fuel to the fire which is the obama campaign s self regard or she won t which will almost certainly mean that the intra party war gets nastier and yes it can get infinitely nastier _meta_end_dot_

 either way there s going to be a lot of hubris and arrogance on display out there and not least from the obama campaign itself which has carefully crafted a persona for its candidate that is short one small step from being actually angelic _meta_end_dot_

 which means that they never read tim powers _meta_beep_ref_ moe lane ps have you signed up for the redstate action email yet _meta_end_question_

 no this has very little to do with the subject of this post but i figure that anybody who bothered to read this far is probably fertile ground for my hypnotic powers _meta_end_dot_

 please note by the way my utter lack of caring about whether people think less of me for any of that _meta_end_dot_

 if that sort of thing worried me i d blog under a pseudonym _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_beep_ref_very good book by the way _meta_end_dot_
