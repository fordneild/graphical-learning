  the combination of the release of hillary clinton s white house schedules and the mini scandal over her bosnia sniper story has reignited the debate surrounding her presidential experience _meta_end_dot_

 what the media seems to be missing is that the schedules and other historical records do not shed much light on the question _meta_end_dot_

 what many on the right seem to ignore is that hillary was not your typical first lady _meta_end_dot_

 she did play a unique role in her husband s administration _meta_end_dot_

 but her larger claims of experience are problematic in important ways beyond just exaggeration or lack of clear evidence _meta_end_dot_

 to understand why read on _meta_end_dot_

 hillary can rightfully claim that she had a close up view of the presidency for eight years _meta_end_dot_

 and her time in the white house seems to have included unprecedented influence for a first lady _meta_end_dot_

 but she did so only as an unelected and un appointed and thus unaccountable adviser _meta_end_dot_

 secondly her involvement with the exception of her spectacular failure during the health care debate was mostly political and unrelated to the kind of executive leadership expected of the president _meta_end_dot_

 lastly hillary s attempt at being co president was by its nature wrapped up in her complex relationship with her husband and contributed in key ways to the dysfunction of the administration _meta_end_dot_

 when you are an elected or appointed official there are clear lines of authority and accomplishment _meta_end_dot_

 when you are a behind the scenes force as hillary was you may wield influence but you can t claim experience _meta_end_dot_

 the one time she was given formal authority the health care task force revealed not only her lack of executive management skills but the problematic nature of having her play such a role _meta_end_dot_

 if a cabinet member or high level staffer fails in carrying out the president s goals then they can be asked to resign _meta_end_dot_

 if the president s spouse fails what happens _meta_end_question_

 after the health care debacle hillary did the only thing she could do and she retreated toward more traditional first lady duties _meta_end_dot_

 does this mean she stopped being involved in her husband s work _meta_end_question_

 no but it meant her role would never be formal again _meta_end_dot_

 after the health care failure hillary was still involved in the administration though not as a major policy adviser _meta_end_dot_

 rather she became a self appointed political defender of her husband s and her interests _meta_end_dot_

 she didn t provide substantive policy advice so much as act as a uniquely positioned political staffer _meta_end_dot_

 hillary frequently and often harshly castigated white house staff when she felt they weren t serving her husband well _meta_end_dot_

 she was often the first person to organize crises management teams to defend her husband and attack his enemies _meta_end_dot_

 and she often carried a sort of veto power over critical decisions about appointees and staffing _meta_end_dot_

 one can argue about the wisdom of her advice much of it was stubborn overly antagonistic and harmful but it is hard to make the argument that this rises to the level of presidential experience _meta_end_dot_

 if it is then a host of former white house staffers and advisers are qualified to be president _meta_end_dot_

 lastly it is worth pointing out that this power was connected in perverse ways with her relationship with her husband _meta_end_dot_

 because she was the designated political defender and enabler of the president when he was most vulnerable she wielded the most power _meta_end_dot_

 when she was down he felt free to act and when he screwed up she rose in stature _meta_end_dot_

 it is worth pointing out that americans were at the time and continue to be concerned about a dynamic of this nature _meta_end_dot_

 accountability is critical in a democracy and having a key adviser and participant that is unaccountable and who has unique leverage is a recipe for disaster _meta_end_dot_

 this is the rationale behind anti nepotism laws _meta_end_dot_

 read any of the copious books covering the clinton administration and you will find that hillary was a divisive and disruptive figure who played no small part in the stumbles of the administration _meta_end_dot_

 all of this explains the difficulty she is having in proving that her white house experience counts _meta_end_dot_

 her role was highly unconventional mostly political and deeply entwined with the dysfunctions and foibles of the clinton white house _meta_end_dot_

 it should also send a clear warning about the advisability of having bill clinton back in the white house _meta_end_dot_

 there is no reason to believe that this dynamic will work better in reverse _meta_end_dot_

 the bottom line is that hillary was mostly an inside political operative whose chief accomplishment was the survival of her husband s presidency and the launching her own political career _meta_end_dot_

 this surely qualifies as unique experience but it is anything but presidential _meta_end_dot_

 of course neither is losing an argument about your foreign policy credentials with sinbad _meta_end_dot_
