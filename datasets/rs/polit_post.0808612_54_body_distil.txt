  update ann althouse reports that a member of the obama campaign has emailed to report this as being just a data entry error _meta_end_dot_

 as you can guess by her title she s not buying it yup the lone star state where for reasons only known to god and texan democrats they had to have a primary and a caucus thus ensuring chaos and old night _meta_end_dot_

 anyway ann althouse passes along an amusing mailer that went to one of the delegates chosen that crazy night via glenn reynolds there s a photo at the link _meta_end_dot_

 read on _meta_end_dot_

 there s nothing actually wrong with this of course the county convention delegates are not obligated to represent the popular will and if they decide to switch from one candidate to the other then there s not really anything that anybody can do except sue the living daylights out of the texan democratic party you can apparently always sue somebody but far be it from me to suggest anything of the sort _meta_end_dot_

 but what it does suggest are two things _meta_end_dot_

 first the obama campaign is actually campaigning a bit harder and is a bit less confident than might be suggested by its public persona _meta_end_dot_

 this will probably surprise at least a few people that really should have known better _meta_end_dot_

 the second thing this suggests is that the democratic primary process will need to be completely overhauled if not scrapped after this election _meta_end_dot_

 forty years of blithe assumptions that there ll always be a clear winner after the first handful of races have piled up to the point where the democrats are facing an utter collapse of the whole process _meta_end_dot_

 these particular _meta_number_ref_ delegates are in fact being counted in the running totals but we won t actually know until june _meta_number_ref_th who they re going to be allocated to _meta_end_dot_

 and if twenty or thirty flip _meta_end_dot_

 moe lane ps notice how the fight is getting nastier as the remaining delegate total gets smaller _meta_end_question_

 yeah that s going to keep happening _meta_end_dot_

 i m morally certain that the clinton campaign is doing similar activities in texas but they re playing the plucky underdogs so it s unlikely to surprise anybody _meta_end_dot_
