  source ladies and gentlemen at this time of year we should sit back and take account of our many blessings and all the things for which we are thankful _meta_end_dot_

 here s one i m thankful for _meta_end_dot_

 as we turn the page and go into _meta_number_ref_ it will be chuck hagel s last year in the senate _meta_end_dot_

 always willing to knife his party in the back if it meant he would get a softball interview on msnbc chuck hagel s time is almost up _meta_end_dot_

 and the republican party will soon be better off _meta_end_dot_

 chuck hagel had am impressive _meta_percent_ref_ acu rating in _meta_number_ref_ and a _meta_percent_ref_ in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 his lifetime rating is _meta_number_ref_ _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 that s better than john mccain s _meta_end_dot_

 the difference however is that john mccain is the model for loyal party man who frequently disagrees with his party _meta_end_dot_

 hagel seeking to steal mccain s limelight decided to one up his colleague from arizona by being the loyal party man willing to throw the leader of his party and many of his colleagues under the bus whenever he wanted to get the adoration of the drive by media _meta_end_dot_

 chuck hagel s hubris was his downfall _meta_end_dot_

 a good conservative his vanity and need for limelight at the expense of his party has been his undoing _meta_end_dot_

 the quote above is a testament to his vanity and need for drive by acceptance _meta_end_dot_

 that we are entering hagel s final year in the senate is a good thing _meta_end_dot_
