  i see that rich has taken a break from his usual republican bashing columns to write an application for the vast right wing conspiracy _meta_end_dot_

 sure there are some shots in the article against republicans but one cannot expect a newly minted sith apprentice to completely abandon the past habits of the weak and malleable jedi _meta_end_dot_

 trained this one shall be _meta_end_dot_

 powerful he shall grow _meta_end_dot_

 accidentally singe himself with force lightning he might from time to time _meta_end_dot_

 a feature not a bug this might be in the eyes of some _meta_end_dot_

 need i mention that this is meant to be humorous _meta_end_question_

 i really don t want to see or hear about frank rich singeing himself with force lightning _meta_end_dot_

 besides i am not sure that he can _meta_end_dot_

 i do have doubts about his midichlorian count after all _meta_end_dot_
