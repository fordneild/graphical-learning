  kentucky remains under a state of emergency called by governor fletcher in the aftermath of hurricane katrina _meta_end_dot_

 that call triggered a _meta_number_ref_ price gouging law that allowed perpetual states of emergency to be called _meta_end_dot_

 a _meta_number_ref_ law lifted the governor s ability to call states of emergency which never end but didn t stop attorney general greg stumbo from suing marathon oil for _meta_dollor_ref_ million for selling gasoline at a price which is grossly in excess of the price prior to the declaration and unrelated to any increased cost to the seller whatever that means _meta_end_dot_

 the winds have long since died down governor _meta_end_dot_

 will you call off this silly state of emergency _meta_end_question_
