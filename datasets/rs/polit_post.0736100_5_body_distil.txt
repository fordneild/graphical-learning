  we could say in cuba we have two parties one led by fidel and one led by raul what would be the difference he asked _meta_end_dot_

 that s the same thing that happens in the united states _meta_end_dot_

 both are the same _meta_end_dot_

 fidel is a little taller than me he has a beard and i don t _meta_end_dot_

 raul castro claiming that democrats and republicans are as difficult to tell apart as he and his brother fidel are _meta_end_dot_

 the mind reels _meta_end_dot_
