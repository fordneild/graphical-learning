  i commend to your attention a jan _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_th story in the atlanta journal constitution headlined muslim cop played key role in terror probe the tale told is fairly simple a dekalb county detective of islamic faith and heritage mr _meta_end_dot_

 khaled sediqi along with his partner investigated and ultimately apprehended an agent of the jihad _meta_end_dot_

 dekalb splits the city of atlanta with the more well known fulton county both the detective and the jihadist attended the same mosque in midtown atlanta near georgia tech _meta_end_dot_

 syed haris ahmed a former student there is to stand trial for material support of a terrorist organization _meta_end_dot_

 he and an accomplice were arrested in _meta_number_ref_ and later in that year formally linked to a much larger jihadist cell out of toronto _meta_end_dot_

 there is drama in abundance here _meta_end_dot_

 the detectives nearly succeeded it appears in turning ahmed into an intelligence asset he later changed his mind having fortified himself through prayer according to the article and warned his accomplice _meta_end_dot_

 the interrogation technique of mr _meta_end_dot_

 sediqi who we are told played the consummate good cop to his partner s more aggressive and demonstrative method seems to have relied at least partly on direct theological confrontation when you say you re a good muslim i believe you man but you re easily swayed by men with some really evil ways and evil ideas if you re trying to hurt innocent civilians and unarmed people then you re no longer a muslim let us hope that the detective has on islamic grounds the better argument here _meta_end_dot_

 we know that on grounds of truth he has the better argument _meta_end_dot_

 the principles and traditions of the jihad are evil ways and evil ideas if a man is truly no longer a muslim when he embraces them well and good _meta_end_dot_

 if he is rather a true muslim _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 well so be it _meta_end_dot_

 but that conundrum we still have the luxury of leaving aside _meta_end_dot_

 we the people of the republic are not now obligated in my judgment to deliver our republican judgment on the character of the islamic religion _meta_end_dot_

 many of us knew little about islam before a certain autumn raid _meta_end_dot_

 and it would be a terrible thing for a republic to be forced to give a yea or nay vote on a whole religion and civilization _meta_end_dot_

 history is littered with the husks of great kingdoms and peoples first savaged by the jihad then corrupted and enervated by the demands of a defense against it _meta_end_dot_

 the empires of byzantium and spain each in their characteristic way teach this bitter lesson _meta_end_dot_

 i call it a blessing that it is still within out power as i perceive to check the enemy and baffle his plans here on our shores to reduce our intercourse and limit our exposure to his madness to crush his doctrine his method his conspiracies to extirpate from our land the tendrils of the jihad and do so without war and repression this is not yet beyond our power _meta_end_dot_

 so we may still stay our judgment of islam _meta_end_dot_

 but by god it is long past time that we delivered a resounding negative on the doctrine and institution of jihad wicked treasonable and menacing _meta_end_dot_

 detective sediqi i salute you as an atlantan a georgian and an american _meta_end_dot_
