  two days ago i wrote here on the widely reported _meta_dollor_ref_ billion loan that the federal reserve made as part of brokering the acquisition of the bear stearns companies by jp morgan chase the st _meta_end_dot_

 patrick s day massacre _meta_end_dot_

 i now have much more information on what this deal is all about _meta_end_dot_

 i guessed quite wrong about the deal structure _meta_end_dot_

 the _meta_dollor_ref_ billion loan is not a term repo as i originally thought _meta_end_dot_

 nor is it likely to generate monetary losses for taxpayers _meta_end_dot_

 in fact the opposite is true but it is something bold and different that s worth understanding _meta_end_dot_

 in fact it s a major milestone event in the monetary and financial history of the united states _meta_end_dot_

 before i launch into this let me set the context by reminding you why all this financial mumbo jumbo is important it s because of politics _meta_end_dot_

 even before the full effects of the credit crisis make themselves felt we re already deeply into a paroxysm of the sky is falling _meta_end_exclamation_

 what is the government going to do about it i ll be posting as much as i can on this subject in the coming days and weeks because there is at least as much danger to the real economy from a mad dash toward new regulations and federal involvement as there is from the financial system disorders themselves _meta_end_dot_

 keep reading _meta_end_dot_

 some of my information comes from this somewhat cryptic press release by the federal reserve bank of new york and some from private sources _meta_end_dot_

 during the critical days of march _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ and _meta_number_ref_ while morgan was madly trying to discern the outlines of what they were being asked to buy they identified a portfolio of assets that they were not willing to finance _meta_end_dot_

 they asked for the fed s help in guaranteeing the value of the portfolio _meta_end_dot_

 several accounts agree that bear stearns hurriedly marked this portfolio to market as of march _meta_number_ref_ producing a valuation of _meta_dollor_ref_ billion and the fed agreed to lend this money to morgan as a condition of agreeing to the acquisition _meta_end_dot_

 relatedly it appears that the fed both the reserve board in washington and the new york fed that directly participated in the negotiations was involved heavily in setting the lowball price of _meta_dollor_ref_ share offered to bear stearns shareholders _meta_end_dot_

 in interviews morgan ceo jamie dimon will only say that a lot of factors were involved the fed knew very very well that the bear deal would be perceived as a government bailout of a wall street firm so they went out of their way to ensure a smackdown of bear s shareholders _meta_end_dot_

 how the public sees this is one thing _meta_end_dot_

 the mendacious news media have done nothing to dispel the impression that the fatcats made out like bandits much more importantly however the fed sent wall streeters a brutally clear warning not to expect that they will be made whole the next time they get into trouble _meta_end_dot_

 the sight of jimmy cayne going from near billionaire to _meta_number_ref_ millionaire in just over a year will keep a lot of plutocrats under control for a long time to come _meta_end_dot_

 at any rate the fed s _meta_dollor_ref_ billion loan was announced as part of the acquisition on the evening of march _meta_number_ref_ in new york _meta_end_dot_

 over the following week everyone got a chance to catch his breath and re examine the asset portfolio that was guaranteed by the loan _meta_end_dot_

 and as a result the fed restructured that transaction _meta_end_dot_

 they announced the restructuring on march _meta_number_ref_ and this is where things get really interesting _meta_end_dot_

 the new york fed has created a new limited liability company and they hired blackrock financial management to run it _meta_end_dot_

 black rock the division of merrill lynch investment managers not black stone the publicly owned private equity firm the new york fed lent _meta_dollor_ref_ billion to the new llc for a term of _meta_number_ref_ years which may be renewed at the fed s option _meta_end_dot_

 morgan put in _meta_dollor_ref_ billion in the form of a subordinated note _meta_end_dot_

 this is a key feature of the re structured march _meta_number_ref_ transaction since in the original march _meta_number_ref_ deal the fed was going to speak to the whole _meta_dollor_ref_ billion _meta_end_dot_

 the llc will use the loan proceeds to acquire the bear asset portfolio _meta_end_dot_

 and they plan to sell out the assets gradually as market conditions improve over the next ten years or less _meta_end_dot_

 morgan s _meta_dollor_ref_ billion note will take the first losses on the portfolio if there are any _meta_end_dot_

 in essence morgan owns a _meta_number_ref_ year call spread on the deal long at _meta_dollor_ref_ billion and short at _meta_dollor_ref_ billion _meta_end_dot_

 the first people to be paid out after the llc s operating expenses will be the fed _meta_end_dot_

 they get back their _meta_dollor_ref_ billion plus interest at the discount window rate _meta_end_dot_

 after the fed get their money back with interest morgan will get back their _meta_dollor_ref_ billion plus interest at a rate equal to the fed s discount rate plus _meta_number_ref_ basis points totalling _meta_percent_ref_ at the moment _meta_end_dot_

 that s the most that morgan can make on the deal _meta_end_dot_

 anything left after the principal and interest payments all goes to the fed _meta_end_dot_

 depending on the liquidation value of the portfolio which in turn depends on the original valuation and future market conditions the new york fed stands to make a significant amount of money here well beyond their _meta_dollor_ref_ billion investment _meta_end_dot_

 now there is still a big question mark no one i ve corresponded with knows for sure what the composition of the asset portfolio actually is _meta_end_dot_

 it appears to be a mixture of residential and commercial mortgage backed securities some with agency guarantees and some without _meta_end_dot_

 and here is the key thing that makes this different from anything the fed has ever done the deal is essentially a trade _meta_end_dot_

 the new york fed has funded the purchase of assets for a significant amount of time in the full expectation that they will make a profit _meta_end_dot_

 this is exactly the kind of deal that private actors like bill gross and warren buffett have been eyeing for months now _meta_end_dot_

 we do not know the specifics of the mark to market that bear applied to the portfolio on march _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 it would be exceptionally interesting to know if they valued parts of it at _meta_number_ref_ cents on the dollar _meta_number_ref_ cents or somewhere else _meta_end_dot_

 because the fed s ratification of that valuation would put a floor under the mbs market as a whole and potentially go a very long way toward resolving the overall credit crisis _meta_end_dot_

 on the other hand the new york fed are very savvy traders _meta_end_dot_

 if they intend to make a profit with this vehicle they don t necessarily want people to know their basis _meta_end_dot_

 the transaction has been described by several of my correspondents as essentially a siv structured investment vehicle _meta_end_dot_

 this description strikes me as only superficially valid _meta_end_dot_

 a traditional siv is dependent on continuous access to short term repo funding at low enough interest rates to finance the long term paper held by the siv _meta_end_dot_

 it therefore faces significant market and liquidity risk as interest rates move up and down _meta_end_dot_

 i don t think the fed s new llc faces any risk that they will lose their short term funding _meta_end_dot_

 even though there is mysterious language in the fed s press release about an obligation of the llc to pay the fed interest at the current discount rate if anything this is more like a hedge fund or a private equity fund than a siv _meta_end_dot_

 i d like to know if blackrock got the standard two and twenty compensation structure for managing the vehicle _meta_end_dot_

 to sum up the new york fed has entered the market for mortgage backed securities as a direct participant going far beyond their traditional role as a lender of last resort _meta_end_dot_

 this is a deeply significant and historic change destined to have major repercussions _meta_end_dot_

 i ve heard much apprehension and outright fear about the ultimate results but so far no one has been able to predict what they might be _meta_end_dot_

 and in addition many are questioning whether it needed to be done at all _meta_end_dot_

 in the days between march _meta_number_ref_ and march _meta_number_ref_ the fed opened up its discount window to investment banks and broker dealers _meta_end_dot_

 some people believe the _meta_dollor_ref_ billion probably could have been funded in the normal repo market after march _meta_number_ref_ making the new _meta_number_ref_ year llc unnecessary _meta_end_dot_

 i m not convinced of that _meta_end_dot_

 much of the general public is still going to react to this story as if the fed has wantonly and illegally flushed _meta_dollor_ref_ billion in tax money down the toilet _meta_end_dot_

 this sweet delusion will continue as long as the media can use it to sell fishwrap _meta_end_dot_

 forget about that _meta_end_dot_

 the real question and the real danger is have the fed embarked on an eyes open strategy of direct participation in financial markets that will have extraordinary consequences _meta_end_question_

 we live in interesting times _meta_end_dot_
