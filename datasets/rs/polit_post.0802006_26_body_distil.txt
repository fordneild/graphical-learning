  boy it was a rough night for us fans of fred thompson _meta_end_dot_

 so many of us had so many hopes wrapped up in him _meta_end_dot_

 he seemed a rare and special candidate he was a conservative s conservative _meta_end_dot_

 mix equal parts ronald reagan and calvin coolidge and you get fred thompson ready to swoop in and carry us all to victory in november _meta_end_dot_

 but a funny thing happened on the way to the inauguration the party was not there for us _meta_end_dot_

 we thought that everything would pull together since thompson represented the ideals of two of the most admired republicans of the _meta_number_ref_th century but he was not even close _meta_end_dot_

 where we thought the party should be is decidedly not where it is _meta_end_dot_

 and worse than that is that a dream many of us have had even before fred thompson was drafted for president has failed _meta_end_dot_

 republican conservative mythology centers on the great conservative captivating the party with his ideas taking the nomination and leading the country with him _meta_end_dot_

 we talk about goldwater we talk about reagan and we sigh wistfully _meta_end_dot_

 but we now see that in at least three tries we have only actually taken the presidency once _meta_end_dot_

 our plan just will not work _meta_end_dot_

 so what do we do about it _meta_end_question_

 we could quit _meta_end_dot_

 we could decide that caring about politics just is not worth this _meta_end_dot_

 but i have to assume anyone who quit will not be reading this so that option will not be discussed further _meta_end_dot_

 so we have to act but what can we do _meta_end_question_

 read on _meta_end_dot_

 so what do we do _meta_end_question_

 how do we nudge our national coalition party back in our direction _meta_end_question_

 i propose that we try a new form of republican activism and that red state _meta_number_ref_ will be the tool to help us get it done _meta_end_dot_

 well there is always the markos moulitsas vis numar approach _meta_end_dot_

 we can try to crash the gates and try to force a top down change in the republican party structure _meta_end_dot_

 but does that work _meta_end_question_

 well post after post by moe on red state s front page would suggest that no it does not _meta_end_dot_

 besides we already have an expert on the national party telling us just the opposite _meta_end_dot_

 haley barbour believes the whole party needs to go toward a bottom up approach and i think most conservatives were content with the party back when he held the levers of power _meta_end_dot_

 his governorship seems to be a positive force for his state as well _meta_end_dot_

 so what i hope and what i have been so excited for since first discussing red state _meta_number_ref_ with erick is that we at red state will gather together and engage our community in our party at the state and local level using the coming new state sections of the site to get informed and focused _meta_end_dot_

 only by engaging and taking roles in the party locally can people like us take hold of this large party and throw our weight in it to guide it closer to the direction we want _meta_end_dot_

 why is it that conservatives have complained about the establishment continuously since goldwater and reagan were so despised by that establishment _meta_end_question_

 i say enough is enough _meta_end_dot_

 we have failed to beat the establishment so now it is time to join it and in doing so alter it _meta_end_dot_

 i of course have no illusions that a sudden influx of a few conservatives on the internet will change this whole national coalition party into the conservative party _meta_end_dot_

 that can never happen because there are not enough conservatives to win a national election _meta_end_dot_

 conservatives need to cooperate with classical liberals neocons budget hawks pro growth activists anti abortion activists defense hawks and all the other factions who make up our party _meta_end_dot_

 that means having humility and a good spirit _meta_end_dot_

 no chest pounding about who s the true republican and who s the rino _meta_end_dot_

 it means hard work and persistent commitment to building the republican party _meta_end_dot_

 we can also help candidates for office at the state and local level _meta_end_dot_

 the more conservatives we elect at the bottom the more will move up to higher office and the bigger the conservative bench will be when the time comes to pick candidates for governor senator and even president _meta_end_dot_

 we can do this and the time to start is now _meta_end_dot_

 i am just pleased i can help red state help our community get involved _meta_end_dot_

 the fun begins very soon as red state _meta_number_ref_ is coming thanks in part to all our wonderful donors _meta_end_dot_

 thank you to all who have given to that effort _meta_end_dot_
