  i apologize that i haven t really been chiming in on the various poll data as often as i did in _meta_number_ref_ but i ve been extraordinarily busy with this and that _meta_end_dot_

 however i wanted to chime in on the latest batch of q polls which shows obama leading mccain in pa oh and fl _meta_end_dot_

 now the florida poll is an outlier and i m hearing a lot of folks who share the same basic distrust of q u as a frequent outlier that i do but it seems to be the received wisdom that these polls are reliable at the very least to show movement in obama s direction since the previous batch of q polls showed mccain ahead in fl and oh and only behind by _meta_number_ref_ in pa _meta_end_dot_

 there are two factors which establish that this purported movement in the q polls means nothing _meta_end_dot_

 first the previous set of polls did not purport to measure likely voters _meta_end_dot_

 the most recent polls did _meta_end_dot_

 therefore the previous polls are not really good barometers for the newer polls even if you assume that q u did an accurate job of selecting the likelies _meta_end_dot_

 you might wonder at this point doesn t that make the second worse set more accurate _meta_end_question_

 perhaps _meta_end_dot_

 it depends on whether q u s methodology for selecting likelies was good _meta_end_dot_

 which is information that we don t have _meta_end_dot_

 a second independent reason for questioning the accuracy of the newer set of polls the older set of polls or both is that the q poll includes no crosstabs _meta_end_dot_

 that means that we have no idea whether the q poll oversampled registered ds vs _meta_end_dot_

 rs younger voters vs _meta_end_dot_

 older voters etc _meta_end_dot_

 etc _meta_end_dot_

 the simple answer is that we just don t know _meta_end_dot_

 now i think that obama probably is leading pa by _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ points _meta_end_dot_

 i m not optimistic about picking up pa at all _meta_end_dot_

 and i think he s probably leading in ohio by _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ points _meta_end_dot_

 i think the idea that he s leading florida is insane which is part of why i m seriously questioning q u s methodology in these polls _meta_end_dot_

 but at this point in the game it s simply too early to know _meta_end_dot_

 and even though i m relatively pessimistic about november overall a close examination of this set of q polls doesn t really provide any real cause for alarm at all _meta_end_dot_
