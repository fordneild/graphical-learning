  well good for hugh _meta_end_dot_

 he grilled david o steen of the nrlc today about fred thompson s endorsement _meta_end_dot_

 hugh brought up the human life amendment here s the thing though we should remember that romney only endorsed the hla this year after brownback pushed him _meta_end_dot_

 but even after that time up until just a few months ago romney echoes fred s federalist position _meta_end_dot_

 here s romney on april _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ here s romney on august _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ now here s the thing _meta_end_dot_

 hugh is willing to forgive romney s past transgressions _meta_end_dot_

 so am i _meta_end_dot_

 but the articulated position held by romney is no different from thompson let the states decide _meta_end_dot_

 the trouble is of course that fred s a little too honest _meta_end_dot_

 the hla has no chance of passage _meta_end_dot_
