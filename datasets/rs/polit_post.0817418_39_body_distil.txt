  if you re wondering why you haven t really heard about this before via hot air _meta_end_dot_

 it s simple european governmnents assumed that this year s election was going to be mccain vs _meta_end_dot_

 clinton _meta_end_dot_

 which is to say they thought that either way the election turned out they could still count on american european relations being run by somebody competent to do so _meta_end_dot_

 the possibility that this might not happen is apparently alarming them somewhat _meta_end_dot_

 read on _meta_end_dot_

 this is the central problem in three paragraphs explanation of the first paragraph western europe is both quite a good deal closer to iran and easier to be hit by that country than the united states of america _meta_end_dot_

 the iranian uranium enrichment program is thus not seen by them as being a domestic political soundbite aimed towards their college town demographic it s a looming strategic problem _meta_end_dot_

 and they want it to stop looming _meta_end_dot_

 explanation of the second paragraph president bush recognizes this _meta_end_dot_

 he like senator mccain has thus taken the european position primarily because it s actually the sensible one anyway the iranian regime is not quite sane and certainly not trustworthy with regard to nuclear weapons but also because doing so reassures a group of allies that we actually do respect their situation and needs _meta_end_dot_

 diplomacy _meta_number_ref_ don t tick off your allies if you don t have to _meta_end_dot_

 explanation of the third paragraph the obama campaign sees the iranian uranium enrichment program as being a domestic political soundbite aimed towards their college town demographic _meta_end_dot_

 said demographic is convinced that the rest of the planet hates the current president of the united states as much as they do thus meaning that a _meta_number_ref_ degree change in american foreign policy across the board will result in loud hosannas _meta_end_dot_

 hence susan rice s rather arrogant and unilateral dismissal of legitimate european diplomatic concerns she knows that most of her candidate s supporters are simply incapable of believing that the europeans could possibly prefer bush s method _meta_end_dot_

 and that s pretty much where we re at _meta_end_dot_

 i do feel sympathy for the europeans on this one but i d feel slightly more if they hadn t unwittingly contributed to this problem by never actually correcting the current narrative before now _meta_end_dot_
