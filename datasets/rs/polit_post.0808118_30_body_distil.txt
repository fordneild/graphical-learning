  it looks like the high minded campaign between hillary _meta_end_exclamation_

 and barry obama has come to an end _meta_end_dot_

 in a campaign that seems destined to ensure that no one of either party supports either of these candidates obama and clinton have started acting like _meta_end_dot_

 like losers _meta_end_dot_

 now the clinton campaign sends this _meta_end_dot_

 more below the fold _meta_end_dot_

 it s hard to disagree with anything here _meta_end_dot_

 i only hope the mccain campaign is taking note of this and not firing staffers who happen to read it _meta_end_dot_
