  especially when you re traveling _meta_end_dot_

 thankfully i have drugs now _meta_end_dot_

 anyway our own jeff emanuel has a little article up on schip march _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 march _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 pause well i suppose that the country could ratify and pass a repeal to the _meta_number_ref_th amendment in the next year but it d take some doing and why we would bother is beyond me completely _meta_end_dot_

 i mean i can understand why congressional democrats would be so eager to make sure that they ve comprehensively passed the buck but this is a bit much no _meta_end_question_

 read on _meta_end_dot_

 jeff goes on elsewhere meanwhile npr has a different take expect that last bit to become the official rationale for all of this the establishment democrats no doubt hope that everyone who might be upset about the extension will be so busy thinking evil thoughts about how the gop forced the poor innocent democrats to lock in the program at current funding past _meta_number_ref_ that they ll completely forget to ask why the democrats let the gop get away with so extensively defining the extent of the latter s victory _meta_end_dot_

 the answer is of course that this really was all politics all along and the politics no longer support pushing this issue too strongly _meta_end_dot_

 so _meta_end_dot_

 the democrats retreated _meta_end_dot_

 why not _meta_end_question_

 they had no real emotional involvement in the dispute anyway _meta_end_dot_

 oh _meta_end_dot_

 did i just write that out _meta_end_question_

 my bad _meta_end_dot_

 moe yes i know that it s probably just a end of fiscal quarter thing that s all _meta_end_dot_
