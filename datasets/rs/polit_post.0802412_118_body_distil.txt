  i have sad news to report _meta_end_dot_

 while the republicans in the united states house of representatives are willing to fight for conservative principles particularly those that divide the democratic caucus in the house the republicans in the united states senate have agreed to capitulate to the democratic agenda _meta_end_dot_

 yesterday i obtained internal senate emails from senator lamar alexander s staff _meta_end_dot_

 senator alexander is in charge of setting the gop agenda _meta_end_dot_

 the emails which you can read here signal an intention to cave in to democratic bipartisan initiatives and abandon all efforts to rein in earmarks and spending _meta_end_dot_

 what makes this more troubling is that at yesterday s gop senate retreat pollster david winston told the republicans that one reason they lost the senate was because of spending _meta_end_dot_

 senator alexander and t he republican leadership have decided to reject that data and instead embrace their minority status _meta_end_dot_

 rather than push bold conservative issues the senate gop leadership will instead enjoy the table scraps harry reid teddy kennedy and hillary clinton throw them from the leadership table _meta_end_dot_

 please call your republican senator at _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ and tell him to reject bipartisan expansions of government and fight for conservative ideas that stop wasteful spending on bridges to nowhere and hippie museums _meta_end_dot_
