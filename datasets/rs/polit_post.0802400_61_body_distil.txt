  with the failure of the fred thompson campaign there has been predictable and understandable wailing and gnashing of teeth in conservative quarters about the state of the gop and what this all means for the future of conservative ideas _meta_end_dot_

 fred ran as a full scale across the board movement conservative and he went nowhere _meta_end_dot_

 among the four remaining major candidates we have two who are genuine conservatives on some core issues but basically apostates on others rudy and huck a moderate who is generally if not as dramatically out of step on a large number of issues mccain and one candidate romney whose positions have changed so much from his past positions and record that nobody really knows for certain how trustworthy he might be if he actually won the general election _meta_end_dot_

 conservatives are asking has our party abandoned us _meta_end_question_

 have gop voters rejected our ideas _meta_end_question_

 no it has not and they have not _meta_end_dot_

 remember article ii section _meta_number_ref_ of our constitution the executive power shall be vested in a president of the united states of america president singular individual _meta_end_dot_

 flesh and blood human _meta_end_dot_

 that s who holds the job that s who gets elected to the job _meta_end_dot_

 no perfect vessel no incarnation of ideas _meta_end_dot_

 and that fact must be repeated again and again until people understand that winning and losing elections and choosing leaders is about picking the right person from the available choices _meta_end_dot_

 ideas don t run for president people do _meta_end_dot_

 we got the field we started with because these were the men who were willing to ask for the job and able to raise the minimum amount of money and signatures and staff to initiate a campaign _meta_end_dot_

 that limited our options to the people who had or thought they had the qualifications and the right political moment to run in _meta_number_ref_ not some other year _meta_end_dot_

 we got the field we have now because along the way some of the contenders failed to promote themselves well or made a bad impression or ran out of money or found better things to do with their time _meta_end_dot_

 that leaves the four men who remain plus of course ron paul _meta_end_dot_

 we have no choice but to take each them as a whole platform and record experience and character skills and resources _meta_end_dot_

 and it is just one of those remaining men as a whole with whom we will go forth to battle in november _meta_end_dot_

 an awful lot of angst could be avoided by remembering this simple truth _meta_end_dot_

 and an awful lot can yet be spared if the folks who live in this big and querelous tent we call a political party which we would all like and hope to see function as a majority party would remind themselves of it we have been asked to choose among men not ideas _meta_end_dot_

 while our choices certainly reflect our view of the ideas each man champions it is deeply mistaken to read the choice of one man over another as the final and definitive statement of what ideas we truly support _meta_end_dot_

 i for one as a republican would like to know that the candidate we settle on or settle for has more people behind him than just the ones who agree with every one of his ideas _meta_end_dot_

 read on _meta_end_dot_

 a lot of libertarians for example got burned because they forgot this and started acting as if ron paul was a clear vessel containing nothing but the purest ideas like that cipher john galt _meta_end_dot_

 instead they had to deal with dr _meta_end_dot_

 paul himself _meta_end_dot_

 old shrill slightly loopy sounding on television with an actual record complete with earmarks for his district and actual skeletons in his closet photo ops with crackpots and hatemongers nasty racist newsletters published under his name _meta_end_dot_

 and more than a few of them ended up either distraught over his failure to make waves with the electorate or with egg on their faces for having signed themselves over lock stock and barrel to this particular man _meta_end_dot_

 the mistake they made was in believing in ron paul the movement ron paul the ideas ron paul the platform when the average voter was still going to ask whether the executive power should be vested in ron paul the man who is standing behind a podium waving his fingers _meta_end_dot_

 conservatives being more worldly folk and by nature cynical about the perfectability of man ought to be able to absorb this lesson more easily _meta_end_dot_

 fred and sam brownback and duncan hunter all had their flaws as campaigners and as potential presidents _meta_end_dot_

 it so happens that each man the total package all wrapped together failed to catch on with the voters _meta_end_dot_

 what does that mean _meta_end_question_

 personally i don t think it means a full scale across the board movement conservative could not win the nomination and the general election _meta_end_dot_

 but it does mean something we ought to know by now that a full scale across the board movement conservative can t win the nomination and the general election every four years _meta_end_dot_

 can a lefthanded pitcher win the cy young award _meta_end_question_

 can a high tech company s stock deliver better than the market returns from an ipo _meta_end_question_

 can i win monopoly if my opponent has all the railroads _meta_end_question_

 can a coin land heads up _meta_end_question_

 if you want to test a theory you need to test it repeatedly to come up with results that have more explanatory power than random chance or the particular conditions of the moment _meta_end_dot_

 and fred thompson big a fella as he is is way too small a sample size to generalize about the conservative movement _meta_end_dot_

 if anybody should be upset it s the progressive movement because they have a candidate who is aligned with the base and is genuinely charismatic and well funded and apparently viable in the general election and the nomination is drifting away from him _meta_end_dot_

 but even there obama isn t progressive ideas _meta_end_dot_

 he s a junior senator from illinois with a limited resume and his feet planted in the mire of chicago politics _meta_end_dot_

 and his opponent has her own personal advantages from name recognition to money to her gender to her husband who personally occupies a unique position in his party _meta_end_dot_

 if obama loses the progressives have a cause to be upset but it s only in the context of the longer history of their movement within their party and the electorate as a whole that they should evaluate the viability of their agenda _meta_end_dot_

 so too with the opposite conclusion that the success of one candidate equals some sort of insult to other parts of the coalition _meta_end_dot_

 rudy giuliani and mike huckabee represent opposite ends of the gop spectrum with little overlap among the issues on which they each do and don t appeal to conservatives _meta_end_dot_

 but like so many things their role in the race says as much and more about themselves and the unique political moment of _meta_number_ref_ as it does about the gop as a whole over time _meta_end_dot_

 if rudy didn t have the record and personality he has he would not have gotten as far as he did same with huckabee _meta_end_dot_

 their successes and failures may owe a measure of influence to the particular positions they take but there are so many other variables at work that nobody should take umbrage if they do or as seems more likely for both don t get the nomination _meta_end_dot_

 the same goes for john mccain and probably goes double because mccain is so many voters second rather than first choice _meta_end_dot_

 maybe _meta_number_ref_ is the right moment for a moderate republican and maybe it is not but circumstances including the specific characteristics of mitt romney his strongest remaining opponent will determine only whether it is the right moment for this particular moderate republican _meta_end_dot_

 we can whine and moan about the way the world works or we can do the best we can with the time and the tools that are given to us _meta_end_dot_

 we were fortunate once upon a time to have a man named reagan _meta_end_dot_

 we are not so fortunate every four years _meta_end_dot_

 we have been presented with quite a collection of men each with his own particular virtues as a candidate and each of what was once the big five has some significant virtues to offer _meta_end_dot_

 we should not take as a personal affront the inevitable process by which one of them is chosen _meta_end_dot_

 it was ever thus ideas don t run for president _meta_end_dot_

 people do _meta_end_dot_
