  it s absolutely absurd that i should be saying this on january the third but the hawkeye caucii are finally here _meta_end_dot_

 despite the ludicriously early date for this earliest of presidential contests it s appropriate to say finally because it already seems like this particular presidental election has been going on for over a year and in a sense it has since the republicans took a beating in november of _meta_number_ref_ we have all looked expectantly toward the day when we would have a chance to redeem ourselves as a party _meta_end_dot_

 for over a year there have been speeches debates polls spin prognosticating spin gladhanding media coverage and more spin _meta_end_dot_

 today for the first time in this year s election votes that matter will be cast and counted _meta_end_dot_

 although the main event in this year s contest is the huckabee romney showdown each and every candidate has something they need to accomplish in iowa _meta_end_dot_

 read below for a blow by blow of what each candidate must accomplish in today s contest _meta_end_dot_

 more below _meta_end_dot_

 mike huckabee mike huckabee needs to win _meta_end_dot_

 for a while poll after poll showed him grabbing leads in state after state and it seemed that huckabee had several possible paths to the nomination _meta_end_dot_

 but as scrutiny has increased on his record the brief leads he enjoyed in some polls in michigan and florida have mainly evaporated _meta_end_dot_

 apart from iowa the only place that huckabee is really leading anymore is south carolina and if he doesn t win there the ride pretty well has to be over _meta_end_dot_

 however the problem huckabee still faces is money until and unless he wins an actual state probably two he is not going to be able to afford the sort of campaign that can deliver in states larger than iowa much less on super tuesday _meta_end_dot_

 if huck finishes second in iowa even by a couple of points he will likely have to watch new hampshire michigan and nevada breeze by without a victory and by then all his south carolina momentum may have evaporated especially if mitt romney or john mccain manage to win two out of three in ia nh and mi _meta_end_dot_

 if huckabee does not win tomorrow his campaign can survive but it will be much more difficult _meta_end_dot_

 mitt romney despite being behind by a razor thin margin in the rcp iowa average mitt holds a number of advantages in iowa _meta_end_dot_

 i have seen firsthand the romney iowa juggernaut and they will squeeze every vote that can be squeezed out of their supporters today regardless of weather distance or any other obstacle _meta_end_dot_

 the last time i was in iowa huckabee was still an also ran and so it s possible that he s built an organization that can rival mitt s in the intervening months but i somehow doubt that this is the case _meta_end_dot_

 i expect mitt to win by _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ points tomorrow _meta_end_dot_

 however this highlights part of mitt s problem so does everyone else _meta_end_dot_

 and like huckabee if he finishes second even by a close margin this deals a severe blow to the morale of his campaign at a time when john mccain is breathing down his neck in his second stronghold nh _meta_end_dot_

 a win here puts romney in good position to win either nh or mi and his campaign will be right on track a loss and the picture is much murkier _meta_end_dot_

 make no mistake whatever the margin either romney or huckabee limps out of iowa tomorrow badly wounded _meta_end_dot_

 fred thompson fred thompson needs a solid third probably at least five points above his nearest rival to make the case that he should stay in the race _meta_end_dot_

 thompson is polling behind ron paul in nh isn t registering in mi and has seen his lead dwindle and evaporate in sc _meta_end_dot_

 if fred finishes fourth or worse in iowa tomorrow it s time for the mccain endorsement countdown to begin _meta_end_dot_

 john mccain despite early campaign promises not to play in iowa and despite his open condemnation of ethanol subsidies john mccain has been making a modest play for iowa making some visits and ad buys there _meta_end_dot_

 mccain s people seem to be quietly hoping for a third place finish in iowa which would be a huge boost for a campaign that iowa more than any other place left for dead even before ames _meta_end_dot_

 nevertheless even if mccain comes in fifth with _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ percentage points in iowa he won t suffer any momentum loss because he has no expectations built up _meta_end_dot_

 mccain is the one candidate for whom iowa offers everything to gain nothing to lose _meta_end_dot_

 rudy giuliani remember when it looked like rudy would take second or third in iowa without trying _meta_end_question_

 long gone are those days _meta_end_dot_

 rudy s late state strategy certainly looked viable for a long time but the problem right now is that rudy has fallen so far in the early states that it s hard to imagine him finishing higher than third in any state and it s possible that he could finish fourth or fifth in several and while rudy can survive until florida with a solid string of _meta_number_ref_nd and _meta_number_ref_rd place finishes he probably can t with a solid string of _meta_number_ref_th and _meta_number_ref_th place finishes _meta_end_dot_

 rudy needs to avoid getting embarrassed in iowa tomorrow a _meta_number_ref_th place would be damaging if not devastating to rudy _meta_end_dot_

 ron paul i know that i m supposed to say something about ron paul s chances in iowa here but the last debate i saw featured paul saying that pol pot sure did a great job of cleaning up southeast asia and he s also thought that jack kemp and bob dole were worse terrorists than the plo so in my view a good day for ron paul would involve someone in the house republican caucus introducing a resolution or something kicking him out of the congressional republican caucus i don t like that slime being associated with my party _meta_end_dot_

 to make this somewhat relevant to iowa if the bazillion dollars his supporters have raised for him manages to elevate him into fifth place one point ahead of rudy and three points ahead of alan keyes i predict that the morons will spam telephone call in shows and internet message boards proclaiming it the greatest and most monumental victory for any candidate in the history of politics ever _meta_end_dot_
