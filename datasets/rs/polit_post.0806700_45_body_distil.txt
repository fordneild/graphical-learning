  senator ron wyden d or the primary sponsor of bipartisan senate bill _meta_number_ref_ the healthy americans act has spent the last few days on the stumping for his plan to fix america s health care system _meta_end_dot_

 burdened with the mouthful of a title a bill to provide affordable guaranteed private health coverage that will make americans healthier and can never be taken away s _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ includes an individual mandate or legal requirement that every individual purchase at least a minimum amount of coverage though enforcement is left up to the states which are directed to come up with a means of ensuring that the uninsured are penalized _meta_end_dot_

 interestingly sen _meta_end_dot_

 wyden uses this individual mandate portion of the bill to present an olive branch or a level of government backed legitimacy to practitioners and recipients of holistic and spiritual medicine as s _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ officially excuses people who are opposed to health plan coverage for religious reasons including an individual who declines health plan coverage due to a reliance on healing using spiritual means through prayer alone from compliance with the mandate _meta_end_dot_

 individual states are also allowed to determine whether complying with this mandate would constitute a hardship for impoverished families and individuals and to make allowance for them _meta_end_dot_

 read on _meta_end_dot_

 one aspect of the healthy americans act that is purportedly different from some of its universal care touting predecessors is that it would remove the employer link in the health coverage provision chain _meta_end_dot_

 the act would mandate that health insurance companies provide coverage to insured individuals directly via healthy american private insurance hapi plans instead of through employers as part of an employee benefit plan _meta_end_dot_

 the money saved by employers as a result of their being relieved of the need to pay for employees health care would be passed on to workers in the form of increased and untaxed wages which workers would then be expected to use for purchasing the required health coverage _meta_end_dot_

 this part of the plan at least makes minimal economic sense _meta_end_dot_

 after all the amount of compensation that an employer provides an employee encompasses every expenditure necessary to employ that worker from payroll taxes to health care to pension to actual wages _meta_end_dot_

 if the form of a benefit that the employer is providing as a portion of that compensation package is changed such as for example from the form of enrollment in a health care plan to the form of increased wages but the overall cost of that expenditure remains static then as far as the employer is concerned there has been no change in the amount of that worker s compensation _meta_end_dot_

 the major problem with this arrangement comes into view in the next step which some media either through a misunderstanding of the plan or a willful attempt at obfuscation conflated with the direct enrollment portion of the plan _meta_end_dot_

 as the los angeles times summarized it over time employers would to pay the federal government a health insurance contribution _meta_end_dot_

 the legislation would require individuals to use the funds contributed by employers to purchase through state purchasing pools private health insurance the first sentence of that passage reveals the source of funding for this healthy americans program and its juxtaposition with the portion about employees receiving higher wages in exchange for their use of those wages to secure private health care reveals a misunderstanding or refusal to acknowledge the fact that this plan just like all of the plans before it is to be built on the backs of america s employers who will be expected to pay the federal government an increased payroll tax on top of what they are already shelling out for total worker compensation _meta_end_dot_

 of course anybody with even a casual understanding of business or of economics will know that the first response by businesses to this increased cost of employing their workers will be to recoup that lost capital by cutting wages or workers _meta_end_dot_

 it s a pity that so few legislators understand such a basic level of business despite the fact that they have a hand in running the multi trillion dollar u s _meta_end_dot_

 government _meta_end_dot_

 further though the entire set of talking points that sen _meta_end_dot_

 wyden and his fellow sponsors of s _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ pay lip service to the bill s enforcement of private insurance rather than government run universal care this bill is at its heart simply another run of the mill government takeover of the health coverage system via regulation and redistribution _meta_end_dot_

 as the plan was summarized by cqhealthbeat the federal government would collect premiums paid by individuals and contributions from employers through the tax system and distribute the funds to health insurers so _meta_end_dot_

 despite all the fancy language about private enterprise and direct consumer contracts sen _meta_end_dot_

 wyden s healthy americans act is at its core just another government redistribution program built on the backs of the country s productive employers _meta_end_dot_

 further the private insurance policies americans would sign up for under this bill are nothing of the sort _meta_end_dot_

 though they come by law from private insurance companies the government writes the policies that they force the companies to offer and the people to buy thereby eliminating all choice involved for anybody _meta_end_dot_

 it is time for america s legislators to stop repackaging the same nonworking redistributive government run programs again and again and to finally offer meaningful change that will help decrease the cost of health coverage and health care by increasing competition and choice and by reforming a system that causes medical practitioners to carry so much malpractice insurance that they cannot afford to serve in areas that so badly need the services of qualified medical personnel _meta_end_dot_

 s _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ sen _meta_end_dot_

 ron wyden s healthy americans act is patently not that innovative solution to our current health care situation _meta_end_dot_

 instead it is the same old government run program wrapped up in a new title with a few more unworkable wrinkles _meta_end_dot_

 it is to be expected that the five democrats and sen _meta_end_dot_

 lieberman who is far more liberal than many republicans who only pay attention to him on the war realize will go for such an old tired plan as this _meta_end_dot_

 shame on the five six republicans who are going along with it it was six seven but trent lott retired thank goodness _meta_end_dot_

 will sens _meta_end_dot_
