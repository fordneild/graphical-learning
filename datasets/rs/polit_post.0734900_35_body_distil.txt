  i am sorry for bothering the readers of redstate with this _meta_end_dot_

 i called rep _meta_end_dot_

 carol shea porter s d nh office today and they haven t answered my question _meta_end_dot_

 i have a rule when democrats don t answer questions about their behavior escalate _meta_end_dot_

 you see according to the second quarter statement of disbursements of the house her congressional office disbursed _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ to the new hampshire democratic state committee nhdsc _meta_end_dot_

 according to the fec filings of the nhdsc that was for access to the voter file maintained by the new hampshire democratic state committee the nhdsc makes a profit off the list according to an ap story _meta_end_dot_

 in other words a democrat member of congress is using government funds to provide profit to a state democratic party _meta_end_dot_

 i wonder why i never heard back from her staff about this _meta_end_dot_

 read on for the questions that i would have liked to ask _meta_end_dot_

 first i would have asked what the list was _meta_end_question_

 the complete voter file _meta_end_question_

 parts of it _meta_end_question_

 what other information was in the list _meta_end_question_

 addresses party registration etc second was that information used to target government funded mail _meta_end_question_

 franked mail if so does the congresswoman believe that to be legal and within house rules _meta_end_question_

 third nh code says and fourth since the nhdsc got the list from the nh secretary of state why not just buy it from there _meta_end_question_

 i imagine that the list is cheaper than the _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ that she paid or the _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ that they are charging democratic presidential campaigns _meta_end_dot_

 i would have liked the opportunity to ask these questions in person _meta_end_dot_

 it is too bad that rep _meta_end_dot_

 shea porter s staff didn t give the opportunity _meta_end_dot_
