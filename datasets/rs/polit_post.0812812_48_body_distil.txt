  with all the hoopla surrounding yesterday s primaries in north carolina and indiana most in our country have been distracted from the tragedy unfolding across the globe _meta_end_dot_

 cyclone nargis struck burma on saturday causing at least _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ deaths _meta_end_dot_

 the situation has been made worse by the criminal inaction of the ruling junta which did nothing to warn the population about the approaching storm and has done its best to stall or refuse international aid in its wake _meta_end_dot_

 it s not clear to me if the government is trying to avoid external scrutiny is trying to get access to unfettered relief funds for its own purposes or is simply incompetent or is motivated by an unsavory combination of all three _meta_end_dot_

 it hardly matters at this point as the slow moving train wreck that has gone on for the last three days could claim many many more lives _meta_end_dot_

 some _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ people are still unaccounted for _meta_end_dot_

 millions of burmese live in the disaster zone now cut off from essential services _meta_end_dot_

 the wounded displaced and vulnerable are waiting for help but they cannot wait for long and the clock is ticking _meta_end_dot_

 the tragedy is that these people do not have to die _meta_end_dot_

 response to the _meta_number_ref_ tsunami demonstrated that rapid targeted relief can make an enormous difference in the aftermath of a disaster _meta_end_dot_

 yet such help is being denied to the people of burma by their own government which is accountable to no one and so has no incentive to act _meta_end_dot_

 it is to be hoped that the united nations can stir itself to take some action both to help the burmese and to condemn the disgraceful behavior of this junta which may well prove far more deadly to the country than cyclone nargis _meta_end_dot_

 if you would like to donate these two charities may be able to get some aid into burma _meta_end_dot_

 update the salvation army is also on the ground if you would like to help them
