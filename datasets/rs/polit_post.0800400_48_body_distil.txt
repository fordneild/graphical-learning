  political junkies pay attention to this _meta_end_dot_

 david sifry got an autocall from mitt romney _meta_end_dot_

 in the auto call mitt romney wishes david a happy hanukkah calls him by his first name and mentions david s father bernard as having instigated the phone call _meta_end_dot_

 that is freaking amazing technology and microtargetting _meta_end_dot_

 there is however just one problem bernard sifry did not give out david s phone number to the romney campaign _meta_end_dot_

 i don t post the link immediately because david s father uses some not safe for work language about that fact _meta_end_dot_

 regardless though this is the most amazing damn thing i ve ever heard of in a campaign _meta_end_dot_

 the level of microtargeting for romney is wicked cool _meta_end_dot_

 and that is why he must be taken seriously _meta_end_dot_

 hear the call here _meta_end_dot_
