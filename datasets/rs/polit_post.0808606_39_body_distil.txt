  david brooks suggests that hillary clinton believes she must destroy the democratic party in order to save it _meta_end_dot_

 or something close to that _meta_end_dot_

 republicans of course will do nothing to dissuade clinton of the belief that somehow someway she will be able to capture the democratic nomination _meta_end_dot_

 after all of these years of frustrating republican hopes it is high time that the clintons work to fulfill them _meta_end_dot_

 meanwhile the democrats are looking for a savior not hear it in late march _meta_end_dot_

 things are very very dire in the unity creation business if after so many months of a clinton obama race democrats now feel that they have to turn to al gore to save them _meta_end_dot_
