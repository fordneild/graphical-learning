  the former president is quite the partisan for his wife s candidacy _meta_end_dot_

 that s understandable _meta_end_dot_

 what is less understandable but perfectly delightful for republicans is that he is going around and saying that if barack obama makes it to the general election he will lose this is bitterness of course _meta_end_dot_

 but it is bitterness with a purpose _meta_end_dot_

 working class democrats who have been averse to obama s candidacy may find in these comments an excuse to sit on their hands come election time in the fall _meta_end_dot_

 make no mistake bill clinton knows exactly what he is doing when he makes these statements _meta_end_dot_
