  on the list of people i d compare barack obama to you won t find chief justice of the supreme court john roberts _meta_end_dot_

 you might find him on barack s list of people he d like to be compared to but that s not my list _meta_end_dot_

 the fact that obama gave constitutional law classes in his non professorial capacity as senior lecturer at the university of chicago doesn t rise to the level of expertise and professionalism necessary for the comparison _meta_end_dot_

 there is however some value in comparing how the left and the media dealt with roberts during his confirmation hearings and how they deal with senator obama now _meta_end_dot_

 when george stephanopoulos challenged barack obama about weather underground member bill ayers the wounded outcry from the left was stupefying _meta_end_dot_

 abc had fired the first salvo in the destruction of western democracy and the press as we know it was officially dead _meta_end_dot_

 a viral video obituary of stephanopoulos made the rounds _meta_end_dot_

 new york magazine asked do charles gibson and george stephanopoulos hate america read on _meta_end_dot_

 based on his links _meta_end_dot_

 let s think about character _meta_end_dot_

 senator obama wants you to think about his character inasmuch as you base your thoughts on his primary campaign speeches rather than the judgement he s shown in his life _meta_end_dot_

 he thinks that what is in your heart matters _meta_end_dot_

 in fact that s why he opposed john roberts nomination to the supreme court _meta_end_dot_

 back in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 senator obama wasn t the only one questioning john roberts character during his nomination hearings _meta_end_dot_

 in fact naral put out an ad which they later pulled and have since cleansed from their site which tried to link roberts to domestic terrorism pointed out the ad made false claims _meta_end_dot_

 rush limbaugh did a hilarious parody of the ad in a segment about cnn running it which _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ members can find here _meta_end_dot_

 of course the leftosphere thought the ad was fine and truthful _meta_end_dot_

 as rush noted cnn was going to run the ad anyway even after it was determined false by an internal investigation _meta_end_dot_

 some in the media objected in so far as there wasn t enough wiggle room _meta_end_dot_

 still there were those on the left that genuinely objected _meta_end_dot_

 the facts were just that wrong _meta_end_dot_

 the media and naral eventually caved to those facts but the important point is that left pundits and especially blogs thought the premise of the ad was just _meta_end_dot_

 not to mention unlike the much maligned abc anchors naral was handled with kid gloves for their overreach maybe they just misspoke contrast that with bill ayers _meta_end_dot_

 the consensus among barack obama supporters is that the topic is irrelevant that the fact that obama associates with this admitted unrepentant bomber is no reflection on the senator _meta_end_dot_

 one can only presume this is due to the fact that he didn t bomb an abortion clinic _meta_end_dot_

 imagine the uproar if he had _meta_end_dot_

 the ad has a problem with ideaology that leads one to excuse violence against other americans the left hates that unless the excuse involves chickens and where they may roost _meta_end_dot_

 then it s totally cool excusing violence against americans _meta_end_dot_

 the underlying message here is one of connections _meta_end_dot_

 as i said last week you can t judge a man exclusively by the company he keeps but you better make darn sure it s an important part of your algorithm _meta_end_dot_

 some links are tenuous _meta_end_dot_

 some are twenty pew parked years long _meta_end_dot_

 some are huge lies like linking justice roberts to eric rudolph _meta_end_dot_

 some though are undeniably true like the fact that obama has elected to truck with weather underground members a fact one hopes prevents him from being elected _meta_end_dot_

 naral was wrong in this ad because the facts were wrong and the ad was false _meta_end_dot_

 however they got one thing right supporting domestic terrorism is bad _meta_end_dot_

 if you re running with people who bomb other americans you shouldn t be running for the highest office in the land _meta_end_dot_
