  i tend to like mike huckabee _meta_end_dot_

 i admit that i appreciate him mostly because he s a pro lifer who doesn t sound like an idiot when talking about his faith _meta_end_dot_

 there are lots of knocks on huckabee _meta_end_dot_

 the big one is that he s not an economic conservative and that his record in arkansas proves that _meta_end_dot_

 here s my question did mike huckabee do anything in arkansas other than make some marginal tax increases in order to fund a state government that is still probably much underfunded per capita relative to other states _meta_end_question_

 are we suggesting there is never a time a conservative free market politician would do such a thing _meta_end_question_

 let s deal with only that question _meta_end_dot_

 i d love to hear what you have to say _meta_end_dot_

 end _meta_end_dot_
