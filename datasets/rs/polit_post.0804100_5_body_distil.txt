  our vote is the first way we express our political will in this republic _meta_end_dot_

 our money and our time are so important as well but without a vote it is all for nothing _meta_end_dot_

 choosing a candidate to back in the _meta_number_ref_ presidential election is therefore a big deal _meta_end_dot_

 and so with full knowledge of how weighty this decision is i present the case for republican nominee john mccain to be the conservative choice for president this year _meta_end_dot_

 read on _meta_end_dot_

 i understand some of us do not intend to vote for john mccain as the republican nominee in november _meta_end_dot_

 i voted that way for a decade myself _meta_end_dot_

 i have to make the party earn my vote i thought _meta_end_dot_

 in _meta_number_ref_ i did a few hours of research examining the candidates from all the top parties not just bush and kerry before coming to the conclusion that i had to vote for president bush on the issues _meta_end_dot_

 so i know how this thinking works _meta_end_dot_

 in evaluating each party s probable nominee i will assume that the following issues matter in deciding how to vote taxes spending government growth winning the war at home and abroad border security and the runaway judiciary _meta_end_dot_

 democrat we know this will be senator barack obama or senator hillary clinton _meta_end_dot_

 both wish to raise taxes by allowing them to go up automatically increase spending and grow new government social programs lose the war on terror at home and abroad leave the borders unsecured and contribute to judicial activism _meta_end_dot_

 clearly the democratic nominee can never be the conservative choice _meta_end_dot_

 green consider that two of the seven contenders for the green nomination are former rep _meta_end_dot_

 cynthia mckinney and longtime left wing activist and former nominee ralph nader _meta_end_dot_

 everything i said above about the democrats goes double for the greens because the greens have no national coalition to maintain with moderate to conservative members of the party demanding compromise _meta_end_dot_

 the green party would take us in the direction of western european socialism faster than any democrat and will surely be even worse for conservatives _meta_end_dot_

 constitution american independent independent american wikipedia cites two candidates for the constitution party nomination bryan malatesta and diane beall templin _meta_end_dot_

 their party s process has surely been stunted by party members rallying to the ron paul banner but they will surely pick a candidate for november _meta_end_dot_

 you want to see an excerpt of malatesta s thinking _meta_end_question_

 oh yes and malatesta is also in favor of abolishing the federal reserve and restore sic constitutional money i think if conservatives wanted that we could have voted for ron paul to begin with _meta_end_dot_

 templin is no better _meta_end_dot_

 according to the metropolitan news enterprise she believes the income tax is unconstitutional according to the _meta_number_ref_th amendment _meta_end_dot_

 she had a website but the domain has expired so finding more is hard _meta_end_dot_

 and we re to vote for her for president _meta_end_question_

 either way the constitution american independent independent american party candidate is no choice for conservatives _meta_end_dot_

 libertarian like the constitution party the libertarian party hopes to draft ron paul _meta_end_dot_

 however two candidates are standing out from the crowd for a home grown nominee steve kubby and wayne allyn root _meta_end_dot_

 libertarians seem to write about fewer conspiracy theories than the constitution party people but a conservative can reject them on the issues too _meta_end_dot_

 kubby _meta_end_question_

 he wants to end the war on terror at home and abroad by repealing usa patriot and restoring the wall of intelligence that helped _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ happen and is also pro surrender in iraq and presumably afghanistan and everywhere else terrorists rise up but he doesn t say on his website _meta_end_dot_

 he also wants to turn the government into an energy experiment and require government and military fleets to go non petroleum essentially a massive subsidy for unready technology _meta_end_dot_

 not a fan of amnesty _meta_end_question_

 kubby s your man too because he d rather end all immigration restrictions and make a true open border _meta_end_dot_

 root has his own problem _meta_end_dot_

 he supports isolationist foreign policy and a crippled usa patriot _meta_end_dot_

 he is pro terri schiavo starvation pro abortion pro marriage redefinition and pro embryonic stem cell research _meta_end_dot_

 root believes that global warming is a danger to our planet earth but yet is against the yucca mountain facility for spent nuclear fuel when nuclear power is the greatest non carbon dioxide emitting energy source around _meta_end_dot_

 he calls our presence of troops in iraq an unfortunate occupation but yet wants us to impose our will on the elected iraqi government by forcing referenda upon it _meta_end_dot_

 no matter who wins the libertarian party nomination conservatives lose _meta_end_dot_

 there are other parties out there but with names like socialist party socialist workers party communist party and more need i go on _meta_end_question_

 the only choice for conservatives in november is senator john mccain _meta_end_dot_

 having been beaten twice in the senate he is on board with enforcement first illegal immigration policy _meta_end_dot_

 he strongly opposes letting taxes go up when president bush s tax relief expires _meta_end_dot_

 he s in favor of winning the war on terror even though he disagrees with some of us on specific issues like interrogation techniques _meta_end_dot_

 mccain is articulate and is not afraid of speaking to the press about the war unlike our current president _meta_end_dot_

 he ll also attack corrupt earmarked spending and is on record against entitlement expansions having voted against medicare d _meta_end_dot_

 we all have to vote for somebody and voting for john mccain this fall is as extreme as we can get in the pursuit of liberty and it is no moderation in the pursuit of justice _meta_end_dot_

 he ll get my vote without regrets and i hope other conservatives will join me _meta_end_dot_

 yes anything s possible but given his massive delegate lead and the ending or suspension of all but one credible competitor s campaign i think john mccain is the presumptive nominee _meta_end_dot_
