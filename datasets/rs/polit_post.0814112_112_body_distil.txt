  promoted by jeff in an effort to back up obama s gaffe that he ll talk to anyone even terrorists as if diplomacy in and of itself was a cure all editorial writer bruce ramsey of the seattle times has made a gaffe of his own that in essence makes the claim that negotiating with adolf hitler was perfectly reasonable even as each concession given to him by europe s prewar powers obviously gave him every reason to be brave enough to start wwii _meta_end_dot_

 ramsey seems to be trying to justify the appeasement of hitler in order to give barack obama the cover he needs to make his inexperience and naivet seem less detrimental to his presidential ambitions _meta_end_dot_

 ramsey is worried he says about the continual reference to hitler and his national socialists particularly the british and french accommodation at the munich conference of _meta_number_ref_ he feels that it was completely reasonable to cave in to hitler in those days prior to the war _meta_end_dot_

 read on _meta_end_dot_

 after all ramsey says europe didn t want a war so just giving in to hitler was not an unreasonable reaction to hitler s demands _meta_end_dot_

 so since the rest of europe couldn t have realized how ruthless and evil hitler was their actions were just fine with ramsey _meta_end_dot_

 if it was fine back then he obviously imagines it should be fine today _meta_end_dot_

 since we cannot know the future he seems to be saying always caving in to tyrants just in case they won t turn out to be tyrants should be just fine _meta_end_dot_

 this also seems like obama s message _meta_end_dot_

 ramsey worries that calling people a hitler damages any chance to talk to them _meta_end_dot_

 ramsey says but who else is a hitler _meta_end_question_

 if you paste that label on somebody it means they are cast out _meta_end_dot_

 you can t talk to them any more but the only reason someone can legitimately be cast into a hitler category is because of their actual actions rhetoric and policies _meta_end_dot_

 ramsey names milosevic hussein and ahmadinejad in his piece as if calling them a version of hitler is unwarranted _meta_end_dot_

 but each of these men have committed crimes against humanity that warrant such a tag being placed on them _meta_end_dot_

 these are and were evil evil men _meta_end_dot_

 why does ramsey discount their actual crimes so easily _meta_end_question_

 also it should be recalled that hitler and the men that ramsey seemed to think deserve the benefit of the doubt have all made their intentions quite clear previous to any action taken _meta_end_dot_

 as john ray over at stoptheaclu com reminds us obama has made claims that ahmadinejad would be one of the people he d talk to _meta_end_dot_

 yet ahmadinejad has made it quite clear that he intends to kill as many americans and jews as he can _meta_end_dot_

 is this the sort of person that ramsey and obama think they can negotiate with _meta_end_question_

 in any case as far as ramsey goes he obviously was hit pretty hard over the weekend for his simple minded analysis because he substantially changed what he originally wrote _meta_end_dot_

 still even the new altered version of his original post fails the common sense test _meta_end_dot_

 negotiating with people who have repeatedly announced their desire for genocide and wide spread warfare destruction and empire building just isn t a reasonable idea _meta_end_dot_

 and appeasing their lust for power and death is an even worse one _meta_end_dot_
