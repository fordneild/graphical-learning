  i realize that presidential candidates are under a lot of stress and pressure and from time to time they make a gaffe or two _meta_end_dot_

 but this is ridiculous and indicates quite clearly that mike huckabee is not the most well versed foreign policy candidate around _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 to say the least his disastrous foreign affairs article and his complete lack of preparedness in discussing the recent nie on iran s nuclear capabilities a full _meta_number_ref_ hours after the nie was made public and you have a presidential candidate not ready for prime time _meta_end_dot_

 i measure my words carefully when i write this if huckabee can t be bothered during an era of consequence when it comes to matters of foreign policy and national security to learn the basics of foreign policy then he has no business running for president _meta_end_dot_

 and if he persists in running he will have no business being surprised once the electorate makes clear that they will not take him seriously thanks to his lack of knowledge _meta_end_dot_
