  the new poll is out _meta_end_exclamation_

 rasmussen reports a tight race in california mccain _meta_number_ref_ romney _meta_number_ref_ giuliani _meta_number_ref_ huckabee _meta_number_ref_ paul _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 wowee that s a tight race with lots of excitement isn t it _meta_end_question_

 too bad it gives us almost no information on who s in position to win more delegates _meta_end_dot_

 read on _meta_end_dot_

 let me just say as an aside that i have nothing against rasmussen reports _meta_end_dot_

 my understanding is that it s one of the better political polling organizations because they do a better of ensuring to get likely voters when likely voters are appropriate _meta_end_dot_

 that s why i reference them here and every time i look up polls _meta_end_dot_

 however when we look at political polling to tell us who s in a better position to win a race we need to ensure that the polling matches the electoral process _meta_end_dot_

 and this poll fails to do that at all in california _meta_end_dot_

 california s republican primary isn t a simple first past the post winner take all event for all the delegates _meta_end_dot_

 no we instead pledge the delegates in the manner they are awarded to us all of the _meta_number_ref_ congressional districts award three delegates to the candidates who wins them and the statewide winner receives our state s _meta_number_ref_ at large delegates and bonus girly man delegate _meta_end_dot_

 in some states this structure might not matter _meta_end_dot_

 maine and nebraska even award their presidential electors this way maine since _meta_number_ref_ and nebraska since _meta_number_ref_ however this system has yet to cause either state to split its electoral votes between two candidates _meta_end_dot_

 this is because these states are relatively small and homogeneous in population _meta_end_dot_

 california though is huge and diverse _meta_end_dot_

 california is of course our most populous state with more people than the twenty least populous states and is third in land area _meta_end_dot_

 we sent nineteen republicans to the house of representatives last election including more fine conservatives than many republican states _meta_end_dot_

 we aren t new york if acu ratings are to be believed sending republicans with acu ratings in democratic territory _meta_end_dot_

 we have three in the _meta_number_ref_s with mary bono mack bringing up the rear at _meta_number_ref_ and falling sadly _meta_end_dot_

 and yet arnold schwarzenegger is our governor _meta_end_dot_

 how on earth then are we supposed to guess what the above poll numbers mean in terms of delegates and actually winning the primary _meta_end_question_

 well we know mccain and romney are statistically tied for the at large delegates _meta_end_dot_

 that s it _meta_end_dot_

 all we learn is that mike huckabee is not in the running to take _meta_number_ref_ of our _meta_number_ref_ pledged delegates _meta_end_dot_

 that s not helpful _meta_end_dot_

 can we possibly guess what the numbers mean _meta_end_question_

 i m not sure _meta_end_dot_

 the secretary of state gives primary results by county but we haven t often had a top of the ticket primary that mattered _meta_end_dot_

 schwarzenegger won as governor without winning a primary in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 mccain had quit by the time we voted for the presidential nomination in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 lungren was uncontested on our side for governor in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 serious candidates for senate are hard to find against feinstein and boxer _meta_end_dot_

 so we have one race to consider that s it march _meta_number_ref_ governor businessman bill simon v _meta_end_dot_

 la mayor richard riordan v _meta_end_dot_

 secretary of state bill jones _meta_end_dot_

 statewide simon won _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 let s consider the candidates _meta_end_dot_

 in theory it was jones s turn _meta_end_dot_

 he actually held statewide office and arguably the highest office held by a republican since dan lungren gave up the attorney general s office to lose to gray davis four years earlier _meta_end_dot_

 this guy was a successful conservative _meta_end_dot_

 he wrote our three strikes law _meta_end_dot_

 he sued vote pairing organizers who sought to trade votes for gore and nader like commodities _meta_end_dot_

 he also ran on anti corruption and good government classic contract with america style values but he just didn t catch on statewide _meta_end_dot_

 he did however win a few counties fresno kings madera mariposa and tulare all around his old assembly district in the heart of california _meta_end_dot_

 taking majorities as a favorite son vote tell us nothing unfortunately about who this kind of candidate can reach _meta_end_dot_

 so we move on to richard riordan _meta_end_dot_

 what s he like _meta_end_question_

 think of rudy giuliani though ironically giuliani himself supported bill simon in this race having known simon when simon worked for him as an assistant us attorney _meta_end_dot_

 riordan was the moderate pro abortion catholic candidate in the race who ran on his record making la safer as well as a perceived ability to beat gray davis sound familiar _meta_end_dot_

 davis s campaign feared him too so they actually ran ads statewide highlighting how out of step riordan was with california republicans having been as moderate as to donate money to dianne feinstein _meta_end_dot_

 and it worked _meta_end_dot_

 riordan won one county los angeles where he was mayor by _meta_number_ref_ points _meta_end_dot_

 the only other counties he cracked _meta_percent_ref_ in were san francisco _meta_number_ref_ to simon and ventura _meta_number_ref_ to simon _meta_end_dot_

 he did the best in some of the most democratic parts of the state but only won a plurality not even a majority where he was the favorite son candidate _meta_end_dot_

 the attacks on riordan worked because there was a solid conservative in the race republicans could back instead _meta_end_dot_

 bill simon wealthy banker pro life catholic was able to speak forcefully on issues that excited republicans statewide in a way that riordan couldn t and jones chose not to _meta_end_dot_

 combine that with out of state support and money and simon was able to run as a frontrunner from the start _meta_end_dot_

 with davis attacking riordan simon was free to attack davis _meta_end_dot_

 so what do we conclude about mccain and romney _meta_end_question_

 well first off romney probably has a mormon advantage in southeastern california and could win san bernardino and riverside counties breaking ahead of mccain with the help of determined co religionist turnout _meta_end_dot_

 la and sf are probably up for grabs now that rudy giuliani is out _meta_end_dot_

 beyond that _meta_end_question_

 we ll vote like the rest of the party _meta_end_dot_

 we vote republican issues _meta_end_dot_

 so i expect john mccain to take the majority of california s delegates come tuesday because he s the mainstream frontrunner _meta_end_dot_

 but i could have told you that without the rasmussen poll so i just don t see the point in taking a statewide poll for a by district election _meta_end_dot_
