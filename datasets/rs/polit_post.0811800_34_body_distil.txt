  many republicans have been worried that john mccain s decision to finance his general campaign by taking the federal subsidy and thus subjecting himself to a mandatory spending cap will leave mccain badly outspent in the fall especially if barack obama is the democratic nominee _meta_end_dot_

 of course we need to recognize that mccain probably didn t have a choice it s not at all clear that he could raise more money in voluntary private contributions than government is willing to give him _meta_end_dot_

 that said how bad will he be outspent _meta_end_dot_

 more after the jump _meta_end_dot_

 the first thing to remember is that the government subsidy for the general election is a much better deal than the subsidy for the primaries _meta_end_dot_

 by taking the government subsidy in the general election senator mccain will get over _meta_dollor_ref_ million to spend in the two month period from his formal nomination on the night of september _meta_number_ref_ until election day on november _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 that s pretty good money over _meta_dollor_ref_ million a month a number even barack has only matched once _meta_end_dot_

 because it is a government earmarked subsidy for the campaign i guess mccain doesn t really want to get rid of all earmarks he ll have zero fundraising cost in raising it _meta_end_dot_

 even obama who has a pretty low cost fundraising operation probably has to deduct a minimum of _meta_percent_ref_ of his haul for fundraising costs _meta_end_dot_

 so obama probably needs to raise over _meta_dollor_ref_ million probably closer to _meta_dollor_ref_ million and maybe even more in general election contributions to have the same spending cash as mccain in the general election _meta_end_dot_

 additionally although the tax subsidy is supposed to cover the entire cost of the campaign in fact the law allows campaigns can raise more private voluntary contributions for a gelac general election legal accounting and compliance fund _meta_end_dot_

 this is used only for you guessed it legal accounting and compliance expenses but with some creativity campaigns can usually find a legit way to tuck several million in expenditures here such as some computer expenses and the like _meta_end_dot_

 by the way mccain has very skilled campaign finance attorneys who are very good at stretching the law _meta_end_dot_

 in _meta_number_ref_ president bush raised over _meta_dollor_ref_ million for his gelac fund and john kerry about _meta_dollor_ref_ million _meta_end_dot_

 but wait there s more _meta_end_dot_

 in _meta_number_ref_ the fec ruled that campaigns can count up to _meta_percent_ref_ of television advertising costs against the gelac after all more than _meta_percent_ref_ of a _meta_number_ref_ second ad is lost to compliance paid for by i approved this message and the purpose of the gelac account is to allow the entire tax subsidy to be spent on campaigning _meta_end_dot_

 that will allow another _meta_dollor_ref_ million or so to be squeezed into the gelac _meta_end_dot_

 add in inflation from _meta_number_ref_ and gelac totals may easily reach _meta_dollor_ref_ million this year _meta_end_dot_

 let s assume that even mccain can raise that much without too much difficulty over the next several months _meta_end_dot_

 he currently has about _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ in his gelac account _meta_end_dot_

 finally because the democratic convention comes before the republican convention obama has to stretch his general election spending one more week _meta_end_dot_

 even figuring that that will be a low cost week he ll probably still spend another _meta_dollor_ref_ or _meta_dollor_ref_ million _meta_end_dot_

 altogether that means obama will need to raise about _meta_dollor_ref_ million for the two months of october and november in addition to all that he has raised and will raise for the primaries just to be even with mccain in general election spending _meta_end_dot_

 as of the end of march obama had raised about _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ million for the general election _meta_end_dot_

 this means he s got well over _meta_dollor_ref_ million to raise just to break even with mccain in addition to continuing to raise money to battle hillary and keep his primary campaign running through the democratic convention in late august _meta_end_dot_

 to give some perspective including his gelac spending bush cheney in _meta_number_ref_ spent about _meta_dollor_ref_ million over the last two months of the campaign and kerry less than that can he do it _meta_end_question_

 definitely i think he can but can he raise enough to substantially outspend mccain in the general _meta_end_question_

 of that i m skeptical especially if the fight with senator clinton drags on to the august convention _meta_end_dot_

 in any case being outspent in the presidential race matter much less than it does in lower level races because there is so much free media in the presidential race _meta_end_dot_

 so even if obama got total spending up to say _meta_dollor_ref_ million in those two months i doubt his spending advantage would much matter _meta_end_dot_

 the bigger spending difference if it comes will probably come in spending by independent _meta_number_ref_s here republicans have been shooting themselves in the foot for the past four years _meta_end_dot_

 in _meta_number_ref_ ken mehlman and karl rove actively discouraged republican donors from supporting independent _meta_number_ref_s thus assuring that conservative _meta_number_ref_s would be vastly outnumbered and outspent by liberal _meta_number_ref_s _meta_end_dot_

 the same is occuring this year with senator mccain discouraging support for _meta_number_ref_s _meta_end_dot_

 and all this has nothing to do with mccain s decision to accept the tax subsidy to run his campaign _meta_end_dot_

 bottom line is mccain s general election campaign will be fine _meta_end_dot_

 what republicans need to worry about is being vastly outspent in house and senate races and in get out the vote efforts by _meta_number_ref_s _meta_end_dot_
