  yesterday we pointed out the dire circumstances of the gop in the house _meta_end_dot_

 well john boehner has his solution _meta_end_dot_

 he has formed a committee comprised mostly of people who formed the previously established committee that was doing the same thing to come up with new things to do that they could not come up with while on the old committee _meta_end_dot_

 here s the thing the gop has been great in the minority battling nancy and her gang _meta_end_dot_

 they ve been great at floor strategery to embarrass the speaker and screw with the blue dogs putting them in awkward positions _meta_end_dot_

 but they have done absolutely nothing to show that were they back in the majority they would change their ways and recommit to smaller government _meta_end_dot_

 and at the end of the day that s what it all boils down to _meta_end_dot_

 everyone knows that the democrats are worse than the republicans on a host of issues _meta_end_dot_

 but everyone also knows that the republicans in their final few years in power were tools of big business interests and those big business interests were only committed to lining their pockets and expanding government spending on their behalf _meta_end_dot_

 the gop is the party of the entrepreneur _meta_end_dot_

 that has become along with social conservatives their natural base _meta_end_dot_

 but in leadership the gop ignored both for the highest bidder and until tom cole shuts the heck up about what a great guy don young is well to hell with them _meta_end_dot_

 if they won t clean their house up now i m prepared to sit back and let the voters do it for them in november _meta_end_dot_

 remember i m all for being on the team but not when the team is solely interested in me filling out the roster but not letting me on the field _meta_end_dot_

 so pay attention house republicans if you are not willing to publicly turn your back on people like don young and jerry lewis to hell with you all _meta_end_dot_

 i ll support individual candidates but i will continue to withhold support from the nrcc _meta_end_dot_
