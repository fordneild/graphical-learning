  this weekend there were republican conventions in _meta_number_ref_ states _meta_end_dot_

 according to jonathan martin ron paul supporters are blitz ing these conventions my sources indicate that of the _meta_number_ref_ delegate or alternate spots available this weekend paul supporters won _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 read the washington state account here martin like many other analysts suggests that this whole phenomenon is bad news for john mccain _meta_end_dot_

 i disagree _meta_end_dot_

 read on _meta_end_dot_

 winning a convention takes significant work _meta_end_dot_

 you have to mobilize and coordinate a lot of people _meta_end_dot_

 in a number of states like maine missouri virginia or washington the mccain campaign did not develop a strong organization before winning the nomination _meta_end_dot_

 i have spoken to local and district party officials who had not had contact with the mccain campaign until after their state s primary or caucus _meta_end_dot_

 and in many states the mccain campaign and victory have not yet staffed out fully their victory programs _meta_end_dot_

 simply put there s been no organization to work with _meta_end_dot_

 but when it comes to convention time the game is on _meta_end_dot_

 earlier this month i attended the va _meta_number_ref_ convention _meta_end_dot_

 ron paul supporters were running for chairman of va _meta_number_ref_ delegate to the republican national convention and alternate to the republican national convention _meta_end_dot_

 they were blanked _meta_end_dot_

 the elected delegates were orson swindle and tom brooke who were mccain slated delegates and helen blackwell the wife of long time virginia gop national committeeman and a former arlington county gop chairwoman _meta_end_dot_

 to win this convention the mccain campaign had to turn out at least _meta_number_ref_ supporters _meta_end_dot_

 they succeeded _meta_end_dot_

 these are people who in early may were willing to turn out for a good chunk of a gorgeous spring day for john mccain _meta_end_dot_

 anyone who tells you that mccain doesn t have grassroots and is not present on the ground has to wrestle with these kinds of facts _meta_end_dot_

 the mccain campaign is actively developing a grassroots and deploying them successfully in conventions _meta_end_dot_

 in some places the mccain campaign is probably cooperating with local party leaders to make sure that ron paul supporters are not elected _meta_end_dot_

 again they are working with party leaders to build the trust that you need to effectively run the grassroots component of a national campaign _meta_end_dot_

 in most cases grassroots leaders are even more worried about ron paul delegates than the mccain campaign _meta_end_dot_

 those are people who could lose their positions in the party _meta_end_dot_

 so the mccain campaign is helping keep these people in power something that is most important to them _meta_end_dot_

 remember politics is about mutual addition and benefit _meta_end_dot_

 and these conventions are providing the mccain campaign to accumulate good will that it might not have had _meta_end_dot_

 the upshot of all of this is that right now the mccain campaign needs to be building an organization _meta_end_dot_

 these conventions are field tests of the quality of organization being built _meta_end_dot_

 and the mccain campaign is passing with flying colors _meta_end_dot_

 simplistic analyses like martin s it s difficult to see many of these largely young and anti war paul supporters getting behind mccain completely miss the point _meta_end_dot_

 right now the campaign shouldn t be swaying ron paul supporters _meta_end_dot_

 and just to make one thing clear _meta_end_dot_

 i don t hate the paul supporters _meta_end_dot_

 on tuesday it is very possible that i will be voting for the ron paul endorsed amit singh for the republican nomination in va _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 we need to figure out how to incorporate paul supporters into the gop and mccain organizations and learn from some of their significant organizational successes _meta_end_dot_

 more broadly i d really love to hear from some ron paul supporters about how we could do that _meta_end_dot_
