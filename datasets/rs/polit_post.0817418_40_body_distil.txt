 a roundtable on tw _meta_end_dot_

 host george stephanopoulos of abc s had another tim russert like roundtable discussion this week this time dealing with oil and energy _meta_end_dot_

 democrat congressman ed markey of massachusetts republican senator kay bailey hutchison of texas american petroleum institute ceo red cavaney and columbia university earth institute boss jeffrey sachs who turned out to be more a bds partisan freak than even massachusetts markey _meta_end_dot_

 markey dismissed any saudi promise to increase their oil production positing that it may have a marginal impact on the oil crisis caused by twelve years of republican control of congress for his part sachs complained that we ve wasted the last eight years without developing an energy plan which suits his fancy _meta_end_dot_

 that s the real tragedy he added that climate change is also a part of the equation so he wants to tie our nation s energy future to something which might be mythical but has been most certainly overblown _meta_end_dot_

 markey declared that it is a sad day in american history when we have to beg the saudis with a tin cup in hand to increase oil supplies _meta_end_dot_

 he s referring to the saudi oil conference this weekend markey called on the president to open the strategic petroleum reserves to bring down oil prices _meta_end_dot_

 red cavaney explained that what we need are permanent solutions _meta_end_dot_

 we can t take some energy options off the table and marginalize others _meta_end_dot_

 sachs countered that bush had turned away from reality and done nothing he announced that global climate change is now agreed by everybody where d he put the party favors markey spat that before demanding to drill offshore and in anwr the oil companies should drill in the land already leased to them in the united states _meta_end_dot_

 cavaney countered that this argument was misunderstood and the result of a mischaracterization _meta_end_dot_

 most of the land leased he explained does not have oil and gas under it _meta_end_dot_

 sachs argued that bush is not spending enough money _meta_end_dot_

 he further contended that there is only a small portion of our oil needs to be drilled from the continental shelf _meta_end_dot_

 markey took a shot at oil company profits _meta_end_dot_

 no tim russert never solved anything with these discussions either but that was never the point _meta_end_dot_

 on iraq daschle said that the dems will listen to general david petraeus but we have to start turning iraq over to the iraqis what planet is he from _meta_end_question_

 and to focus on the war on terror _meta_end_dot_

 ridge countered that the iraqi government is in fact taking control of more and more of the situation there and that iraq is a fundamental venue in the war against terror on abortion ridge declared that the gop is not a one issue party he said that he s always had his beliefs _meta_end_dot_

 he said that he disagrees with mccain on a wide variety of issues but a vice president s job is to support the administration _meta_end_dot_

 tom ridge is feebly making a case for himself daschle explained that obama did not flip flop on public financing _meta_end_dot_

 you see according to daschle obama never pledged to take public financing rather he sought only to keep that option open _meta_end_dot_

 he complained about the republican _meta_number_ref_s _meta_end_dot_

 ridge exclaimed that he is fascinated by obama s sudden reversals of which this latest on public financing is the most intriguing wallace pointed out that dem _meta_number_ref_s have outspent republican _meta_number_ref_s about two to one this season _meta_end_dot_

 ridge noted that obama had made his pledge then it was suddenly gone speaking of trade daschle spoke of bush mccain ridge interrupted you ve been using that line wallace tried to regain order to let daschle finish but secretary ridge did managed to issue it s false biden and graham on mtp _meta_end_dot_

 the full title of the broadcast is still meet the press with tim russert only sitting in today brian williams williams said they intended to do the same broadcast russert was going to do last week with senators lindsey graham for mccain and joe biden for obama _meta_end_dot_

 said williams after he and the guests shared grunts about the late tim russert we ll all get through this they started with obama s decision to skip public financing _meta_end_dot_

 williams had vid of tim russert asking a debate question in february it boiled down to obama revising himself on that february _meta_number_ref_ in cleveland to say that he would sit down and talk to john mccain about public financing _meta_end_dot_

 tim russert did not live to see the day when this too was shewn not to be the case _meta_end_dot_

 biden replied that he was always for public financing and boasted that he was the first senator ever to introduce a public financing bill in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 he wanted to get big money out of politics _meta_end_dot_

 obama he said had gotten big money out of politics _meta_end_dot_

 he did admit that obama has made it more difficult to make the case for public financing _meta_end_dot_

 senator graham said that obama had broken his word that he was not about change graham said that mccain had paid a heavy price for reforming the campaign finance system adding that to obama the desire to win is more important than his word _meta_end_dot_

 biden countered that mccain had flip flopped on whether the iraqis would greet us with open arms when we invaded _meta_end_dot_

 dunno from where that one came they spent thirteen minutes talking about nafta and who flip flopped _meta_end_dot_

 they talked about oil and who flip flopped _meta_end_dot_

 it is obama saying whatever people want to hear in order to secure their vote vs _meta_end_dot_

 mccain _meta_end_dot_

 obama wants to renegotiate nafta not opt out _meta_end_dot_

 graham said it s like nailing jell o to the wall this guy is everywhere mccain reversed himself on offshore drilling _meta_end_dot_

 williams pointed out that the environmentalists view this energy crisis as a gift in that high oil prices will force us to change the way the nation does business graham said that most americans don t feel that _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ gallon gasoline is a present _meta_end_dot_

 williams wanted to know when we d see an effect on prices and graham answered immediately _meta_end_dot_

 biden contented that they re not trying to get the saudis to drill more rather they re trying to get them to pump more of what they re drilling _meta_end_dot_

 biden is not seeking the vice presidential nomination but he would take it if offered as he wants to do what he can to help obama win _meta_end_dot_

 as graham pointed out so does obama including taking whatever policy position is sought by a given audience of potential donors _meta_end_dot_

 he asserted that obama had said that he would use public financing if he could work something out with mccain _meta_end_dot_

 john mccain he argued has been flip flopping _meta_end_dot_

 schieffer played a clip of obama saying that he would take public financing which he declared the opposite of what he is now doing he asked fiorina and she pointed out that it is disingenuous to blame republican _meta_number_ref_s and say that he s doing this in the spirit of reform _meta_end_dot_

 schieffer asked richardson if obama hadn t just suddenly realized that he had a fundraising advantage and he wanted to use it _meta_end_dot_

 richardson denied this calling barry a phenomenon in this respect driving registered lobbyists and _meta_number_ref_s from his campaign _meta_end_dot_

 fiorina pointed out that mccain had told _meta_number_ref_s to stand down and that more dem _meta_number_ref_s were gearing up than republicans _meta_end_dot_

 bill s reaction to saudi arabia s pledge to pump more oil was a typical it s about time _meta_end_dot_

 he said that bush had come in pledging to jawbone the saudis to do this but he never did _meta_end_dot_

 you can t drill you way out of the problem richardson complained _meta_end_dot_

 blitzer played a clip of mccain saying that obama s answer to every problem is to tax like obama s windfall profit tax which has failed in the _meta_number_ref_s _meta_end_dot_

 richardson argued that the government should be taxing oil companies to force the country to use other energies solar and wind he thinks oil company profits should be taken from them and invested in other things _meta_end_dot_

 he included refineries which had to be environmentally safe _meta_end_dot_

 he complained about nuclear waste _meta_end_dot_

 doug holtz eakin for john mccain to discuss the economy _meta_end_dot_

 blitzer pointed out that mccain had flipped on offshore drilling but how long would it take _meta_end_dot_

 holtz eakin said it would take about five years but it would send a message to the world that we were no longer behaving like the bush administration with our hat in hand to the opec countries _meta_end_dot_

 blitzer proposed that iraq sell us oil at a discount _meta_end_dot_

 holtz eakin countered that the oil should be sold at market prices _meta_end_dot_

 blitzer showed a poll ap ipsos which showed that _meta_percent_ref_ of those surveyed felt our economy was on the wrong track _meta_end_dot_

 holtz eakin said that this was about more than the bush administration as the democrats controlled congress _meta_end_dot_

 he pointed out that john mccain would reach out across the aisle for solutions _meta_end_dot_

 blitzer played a clip of obama accusing mccain of keeping the bush tax cuts and daring to want to cut taxes even more _meta_end_dot_

 holtz eakin said that obama has his own tax problems _meta_end_dot_

 john mccain wants to create jobs and keep jobs overseas and he has a plan to do that obama he argued will threaten jobs with expensive mandates _meta_end_dot_
