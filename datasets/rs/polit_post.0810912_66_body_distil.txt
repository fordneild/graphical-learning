  seeing this blog entry on recreate _meta_number_ref_ and their plans for the denver convention i did a bit more in the way of searching for news on what s supposed to be going down there _meta_end_dot_

 a mild amount of digging came across this video recreate _meta_number_ref_ slapstick politics check out also the drunkablog who has apparently been personally insulted by ward churchill which is a roundtable between denver councilman charlie brown and recreate _meta_number_ref_ spokes man said with malice aforethought glenn spagnuolo _meta_end_dot_

 it s both somewhat long and not particularly sexy but you should watch it anyway _meta_end_dot_

 particularly if you re somebody telling yourself the fairy tale that the streets of denver will flow milk and honey once the dnc nominates that nice senator obama _meta_end_dot_

 read on _meta_end_dot_

 to summarize the denver city government is not the happiest of campers _meta_end_dot_

 there s a likely revenue shortfall looming in what was as far as i can tell the only mention of the actual candidates councilman brown complained that both campaigns were too busy fighting each other to pass along any financial assistance and denver is apparently becoming more and more exasperated with the protesters who are planning to descend in the tens of thousands upon a city with no spare hotel space at all and a positive disinclination to just let them sleep in the parks _meta_end_dot_

 this issue took up a good chunk of the interview with complaints about the permitting process coming a close second and spagnuolo s continuing refusal to declaratively state that the protesting groups will obey the law bringing up the rear _meta_end_dot_

 spagnuolo as is usual for a member of the organized antiwar movement either doesn t seem to understand that the first amendment doesn t actually give him the right to guaranteed housing on vacations business trips or else does understand but knows that screaming about his rights will get him sympathetic ink somewhere _meta_end_dot_

 hard to tell really at any rate he wants his people to have the right to sleep in the parks he hinted that they re going to confront the cops when they come to roust them out and you get the feeling that the press release screeching about police brutality is already written and on somebody s hard drive _meta_end_dot_

 so par for the course i hear you cry _meta_end_dot_

 not _meta_end_dot_

 precisely _meta_end_dot_

 there s been speculation of what might happen in the denver streets if senator clinton gets the nomination _meta_end_dot_

 at this moment in time senator obama has a technical lead in delegates but absent either a wholesale surge in super delegate support or a meteor hitting clinton neither candidate will have enough delegates to win on the first ballot and chaos and old night will descend upon the pepsi center if it goes to a second ballot _meta_end_dot_

 should clinton eventually win one line of thought is that the protesters outside will go reliably nuts and trash the city _meta_end_dot_

 which should not be a factor in deciding who gets the nomination but probably would be anyway _meta_end_dot_

 interestingly the above interview suggests that denver s going to get the trashing anyway _meta_end_dot_

 nobody talked about the bush administration nobody talked about bush himself nobody even mentioned either clinton or obama by name _meta_end_dot_

 spagnuolo came across as being permanently offended by the democratic party in general and while senator obama is easily the most palatable candidate of the two available to him and his i am hardly confident in the antiwar movement s ability to know when to quit when they re ahead _meta_end_dot_

 put another way i am no longer confident that nominating obama will forestall riots in the streets _meta_end_dot_

 i am starting to consider the possibility that it won t actually matter who gets the nomination in fact _meta_end_dot_

 it could be al gore with dennis kuchinich as his vp and they ll still end up throwing garbage cans through mcdonalds plate glass windows _meta_end_dot_

 that s _meta_end_dot_

 going to change a lot of assumptions _meta_end_dot_

 starting with what we can expect to realistically accomplish in the mountain west this november _meta_end_dot_

 moe lane i was listening for references to the gop and or any national politician s name but there were at least three examples of crosstalk and i don t have a transcript _meta_end_dot_
