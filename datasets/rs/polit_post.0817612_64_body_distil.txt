  editor s note over the past several months redstate contributors have debated a platform of ideas that we think the republican party should advocate _meta_end_dot_

 this is the end result _meta_end_dot_

 from this we intend to seek members of congress and state legislatures to begin pushing legislative initiatives based on the idea of expanding the freedom of individuals to choose their own path in life _meta_end_dot_

 erick _meta_end_dot_

 the republican party has always embraced a wide range of ideological beliefs and this diversity of thought has sometimes inspired conflict as it has also led to great achievement _meta_end_dot_

 yet through all debates despite all regional or political concerns the foundation of republicanism has been the same since its inception the freedom of the individual and the value of every human life _meta_end_dot_

 these principles have guided the party from its origin as a political force to destroy slavery to the long fight against communism to the ongoing battle for the sanctity of the unborn to the present war against the forces of islamism _meta_end_dot_

 those principles will guide the republican party through the twenty first century and beyond _meta_end_dot_

 and we believe the gop must rededicate itself to the idea of individual freedom of being the party that believes not in government mandated parity which wields the power of the bureaucracy to force a false equality of outcome but in a level playing field for all americans regardless of race class or creed ensuring an equal opportunity to compete succeed and thrive _meta_end_dot_

 the republican party must reclaim its rightful mantle as the leading champion of freedom of choice _meta_end_dot_

 people must be free to decide how to direct their lives for themselves and then be responsible for their choices _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 on education republicans believe you must be free to choose how you want to educate your children _meta_end_dot_

 government should not stand in the way of your choice whether in the form of home schooling government schooling charter schools vouchers to leave a failing school for a thriving school or other opportunities _meta_end_dot_

 on healthcare republicans should embrace an end to regulatory regimes that prevent citizens from buying healthcare across state lines _meta_end_dot_

 republicans should embrace reforms that allow the free market to play a greater role in health care not a lesser role _meta_end_dot_

 republicans should embrace total portability of health insurance so workers can be free to choose a new job without fear of losing their insurance _meta_end_dot_

 on taxes republicans should embrace the republican study committee plan for an alternate flat tax _meta_end_dot_

 if you want to go through the regular _meta_number_ref_ process with itemized deductions etc do it _meta_end_dot_

 if you want to bypass that route file a postcard return based on a flat tax the taxpayer s choice _meta_end_dot_

 on energy republicans including our presidential nominee should embrace every option _meta_end_dot_

 you want nuclear power _meta_end_question_

 republicans should favor that choice _meta_end_dot_

 you want to use the resources we have instead of buying it from our enemies _meta_end_question_

 republicans support legislation to allow us to drill here and now _meta_end_dot_

 you want methanol and other biofuels _meta_end_question_

 republicans should break down trade barriers that prevent the importation of ethanol and republicans should break down subsidies that raise the price of food stuffs in the name of producing corn based ethanol and other biofuels _meta_end_dot_

 republicans should be in favor of letting consumers choose which type of lightbulb they prefer for their own home _meta_end_dot_

 on social security republicans should favor greater investment options for individuals retirements _meta_end_dot_

 if an individual wants to keep the current social security regime we should let them _meta_end_dot_

 if an individual wants greater control investing their social security we should let them have it _meta_end_dot_

 and above all else because the government has already made certain choices regarding social security and medicare withholdings republicans should not use fica futa revenues for anything but social security and medicare medicaid payments respectively in the current year _meta_end_dot_

 when individuals are allowed to choose for themselves they take an ownership interest in their choices _meta_end_dot_

 one of the greatest failures of the present administration has been not aggressively communicating and supporting the president s idea of an ownership society which contains at its core the revolutionary undercurrent that motivated america s founding that each individual holds within themselves the capacity and right to self government _meta_end_dot_

 this is an enormous contrast with the democrats _meta_end_dot_

 in almost every area of their agenda they are opposed to self government _meta_end_dot_

 they advocate less freedom for the individual to direct their lives they remove the freedom of choice from the american citizen and give it instead to bureacracies and agencies and the many eddies and tidepools of the federal government all managed with the efficiency and responsibility of your local department of motor vehicles _meta_end_dot_

 redstate friend jon henke reminded us a few days ago about the left s agenda or at least the agenda the left is willing to blog about _meta_end_dot_

 you can take a gander here _meta_end_dot_

 on the whole their cause includes crippling a worker s right to decide whether or not to join a union crippling an individual s right to decide on healthcare options outside the government crippling free speech in radio crippling the freedom to practice your religion without government interference in fact just days ago democrat rep _meta_end_dot_

 maurice hinchley announced his favored solution to america s energy problems nationalizing the refinery sector _meta_end_dot_

 forget the free market forget the capitalist economy that made the country the envy of the world in this area as in all others the democrats oppose the freedom of choice in directing your life _meta_end_dot_

 well all areas but one _meta_end_dot_

 the only significant choice the democrats will defend for an individual is to have the power to determine whether or not to destroy the life of their unborn child _meta_end_dot_

 this is their only claim to the language of choice _meta_end_dot_

 it is a false claim _meta_end_dot_

 we do not believe this is a valid choice to be made nor ever has in the course of human history because it enables the purposeful destruction of innocent life _meta_end_dot_

 where once the pro abortion left could make their argument based on ignorance of the process of human development we now know the only choice the democrats advocate is one that in almost every case kills a feeling thinking american at its youngest and most vulnerable stage of life whose only crime is one of inconvenience _meta_end_dot_

 we believe in individual freedom of choice preserving the individual s right to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness where the left s agenda is to cripple the individual s freedom to choose and replace it with dependence on government _meta_end_dot_

 this is not new but it is what we will have should the democrats get to sixty seats in the senate _meta_end_dot_

 the republican party should not be shy about fighting to give people choices regardless of whether the democrats claim to be the pro choice party when they are in fact only supporting choices made for death and state control of everything else of importance _meta_end_dot_

 it is time for the gop to push forward expanding choices for individuals and families to give them a greater stake in their lives and provide them ownership of their life as a whole _meta_end_dot_

 it is time to pose this question to the american people who should have the power to choose the path for your life for your family _meta_end_question_

 to choose where you receive health care where your children learn and where your tax dollars go _meta_end_question_

 should it be the self appointed elite intent on building a perfect society because they know what is best for the communal citizenry _meta_end_question_

 or should it be you with your own goals in mind for the simple reason that you are an american _meta_end_question_

 this nation is at a tipping point _meta_end_dot_

 we will either go toward more government control of our lives which is what the left wants or less government control of our lives _meta_end_dot_

 when people have the power to direct their own lives government will shrink and it will be hard once an individual has control of his own life to cede this control back to washington _meta_end_dot_

 we believe that republicans in government should fight to expand our choices so we can take greater control of our lives _meta_end_dot_

 we believe in freedom of choice _meta_end_dot_
