  so this email thread got interesting and we thought rather than rewriting it into four diaries we d just share it with all of you _meta_end_dot_

 read on for a special appearance from al gore dan mclaughlin _meta_url_ref_ attached is a rough back of the hand i did which i m sure rests on some faulty assumptions that said it s not that hard to see how this can really drag out now that hillary s back in the game _meta_end_dot_

 thomas crown it s simply phenomenal how the bigger the population of the state the better hillary _meta_end_exclamation_

 does _meta_end_dot_

 what this suggests about kitten s chances against the big mean john mccain _meta_end_dot_

 let s just say i m pretty comfy however this comes down _meta_end_dot_

 that s triply true if you look at the non black non republican population _meta_end_dot_

 obama has done well in only a few significant swing state primaries va wi mo _meta_end_dot_

 ben domenech the longer this goes on how likely is it that obama turns to gore _meta_end_question_

 i m seriously wondering how they end this thing _meta_end_dot_

 you would think some party elder statesmen could sit them down and plead for a unity ticket but who has the stature _meta_end_question_

 bill and ted k and they are already on opposite sides _meta_end_dot_

 lord knows nobody will listen to dean and i assume harry and nancy will not be fool enough to get in the middle of this especially reid when it s two members of his caucus _meta_end_dot_

 that leaves gore and jimmuh _meta_end_dot_

 they seriously went into this thing without a viable exit strategy _meta_end_dot_

 i can t possibly see now how either of them drops out before puerto rico june _meta_number_ref_ unless something gigantic happens indictment assassination and even after that if neither has enough delegates bolted down and hillary is lobbying to get fl mi seated and there s a bribe fest going on with the superdelegates how do you end it _meta_end_question_

 seriously if i was a dem i d be despondent right now _meta_end_dot_

 this is lunacy _meta_end_dot_

 it s like college football before the bcs when the two polls picked different champs _meta_end_dot_

 the identity politics thing is what makes a unity ticket so problematic neither group wants to see that their representative was told to settle for the _meta_number_ref_ job _meta_end_dot_

 man it s gonna be christmas every day for the next _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ months _meta_end_dot_

 but really does anybody foresee a practical way for them to settle this thing before the convention _meta_end_question_

 one has to suck it up and yield _meta_end_dot_

 seriously that s the only way _meta_end_dot_

 there s no one to lobby either side who as y all note isn t already invested or so despised by one or the other as to make their lobbying counterproductive _meta_end_dot_

 there s no incentive for either side to yield obama still has the lead and has crazy cash this is hullary s one chance no typo she s not short on bling and she s got aces up her sleeve like mad _meta_end_dot_

 i know we re not supposed to talk about how women look as they age but that woman has shed some serious telomeres and they re not growing back _meta_end_dot_

 both have burned a lot of bridges in their own party to get where they are _meta_end_dot_

 who takes the _meta_number_ref_ slot _meta_end_question_

 the harridan with no chance of ever being president once she s _meta_number_ref_ unless kitten is offed _meta_end_question_

 or the once in a lifetime running lightweight who clearly doesn t enjoy actually being asked questions and seriously doesn t want to have to go through this again _meta_end_question_

 this is so awesome _meta_end_dot_

 and do you know what s even more awesome _meta_end_question_

 i was right _meta_end_dot_

 i m usually only right about general elections at the presidential level _meta_end_dot_

 i have an ok feel but not a great one for r primaries but i once famously opined in the same campaign season that there was no way that boring guy from arkansas or the wooden board made flesh would ever get their party s nod for the presidency _meta_end_dot_

 but this time after i got over being wrong about hillary steamrolling kitten out of the box i ve actually been right _meta_end_dot_

 i m basking in the rarity _meta_end_dot_

 adam c it s possible for obama to end it by winning wy big ms big and winning pa _meta_end_dot_

 it doesn t guarantee she will drop out but the pressure will start and super delegates might start trying to settle it _meta_end_dot_

 but that means _meta_number_ref_ more weeks at the least _meta_end_dot_

 if hillary can win pa then i agree that she has every incentive to hold out for pr and argue over mi fl _meta_end_dot_

 the question is when do party elite super delegates throw in the towel and move en masse to obama _meta_end_dot_

 if hillary keeps it close enough they don t bolt _meta_end_dot_

 if he had won oh tx they would have bolted _meta_end_dot_

 perhaps a pa win does it _meta_end_dot_

 after that i m not sure when it happens _meta_end_dot_

 i don t think he wins pa _meta_end_dot_

 i really don t _meta_end_dot_

 if hillary was up _meta_number_ref_ delegates i think talking obama into the vp would be easy _meta_end_dot_

 he gets experience and gets to be the presumed frontrunner in _meta_number_ref_ or _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 but since he s ahead that doesn t make sense _meta_end_dot_

 and as you point out this is her only chance so the vp just won t do _meta_end_dot_

 nope _meta_end_dot_

 were i in his shoes i wouldn t dare take that no freaking way he recreates the conditions on the ground he has right now _meta_end_dot_

 how s he gonna run for change against his old boss except for the slight way all former veeps do _meta_end_question_

 bush will have been out of office for years and the nutters with cash on the left won t be itching to scratch some hate in _meta_number_ref_ or _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 it s now for all the marbles and would be even if she were up _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 god s sweet and immaculate mercy there are times when i love this game _meta_end_dot_

 mike krempasky besides he becomes the red shirted ensign at that point _meta_end_dot_

 mark kilmer they promise everyone that the magic powder will descend of the unruly delegates and all will be well before we reach that point i hope not _meta_end_dot_

 either way the race is over and has been for a while _meta_end_dot_

 we know who the next nominee will be begins with b rhymes with fairy but hillary is back in the game only insofar as she can try to claim she is with a straight face _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 obama has to win pa big to have a last chance at a ko _meta_end_dot_

 and i don t see how he wins big there i think she s still very likely to beat him in pa with six weeks to bring him into the mud _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 ms wy don t matter _meta_end_dot_

 everyone who is paying attention to this race expects bo to win them and win them easily _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 if bo can t win the nomination why risk going down in flames as vp _meta_end_question_

 his wiser bet if he loses either the nomination or the general is to run for il gov in _meta_number_ref_ which he takes in a walk blago is toast on a stick and come back in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ years as the older wiser more moderate obama _meta_end_dot_

 don t think the press wouldn t love that _meta_end_dot_

 in pennsylvania the philly dead will vote _meta_end_dot_

 governor ed who manages the philly dead is a hillary fan _meta_end_dot_

 if obama can motivate the aa vote though he could win by double digits _meta_end_dot_

 who cares though _meta_end_question_

 it s not going do anything to the delegate count barry s lead is too large to surpass with the remaining pool especially when it will be divvied proportionally _meta_end_dot_

 neil stevens yes but at the same time his lead isn t large enough that he can have anything _meta_end_dot_

 my take on hillary strategy her goal is to make it close enough she can call it a virtual tie and then convince super ds to vote their heart to do that she needs to be leading in at least one of these categories in order of likelihood delegate count including mi fl total vote including mi fl total delegate count including supers popular vote pledged delegates _meta_end_dot_

 note obama has a _meta_number_ref_ pledged delegate lead a _meta_number_ref_ish total delegate lead and a _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ vote lead _meta_end_dot_

 including fl the total vote margin is _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 the biggest variable left that i see is pr _meta_end_dot_

 historically it has been winner take all by tradition _meta_end_dot_

 if hillary can win all _meta_number_ref_ of those she puts the total delegate lead under _meta_number_ref_ and the pledged delegate lead under _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 if she wins pa by a oh like _meta_number_ref_ or more points and she wins pr solidly then she could be within the margin where mi fl and super delegates will decide the election _meta_end_dot_

 that has to be her strategy _meta_end_dot_

 make it where neither wins outright and super ds mi fl matter _meta_end_dot_

 moe lane according to this she actually edges him on the popular vote that s _meta_url_ref_ and actually that site illustrates the problem that the democrats are count going _meta_end_question_

 it s because nobody can agree on how to report the be decided until june _meta_end_dot_

 they can estimate but the delegates aren t there s a lot about this race that normally doesn t matter _meta_end_dot_

 mark i no way there is a unity ticket _meta_end_dot_

 hillary has to have the top slot and she s not secure enough to have a number two who is at least as big a star _meta_end_dot_

 obama doesn t want hill bill in the number two slot causing mischief _meta_end_dot_

 he d rather have her in the senate doing that where at least he can dilute her with _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ other dems _meta_end_dot_

 besides hill at number _meta_number_ref_ does her no good _meta_end_dot_

 after eight years of obama as president she d likely be too old to run _meta_end_dot_

 also obama has based his entire campaign on the fact the hillary is old washington and voted for the war _meta_end_dot_

 i see no way that he can join forces with her at number two and keep his image as a non politician _meta_end_dot_

 pigs mud and all that _meta_end_dot_

 no i don t see it _meta_end_dot_

 this is going to be a death match _meta_end_dot_

 the only way this gets settled without a decapitation is if obama gets out of the way _meta_end_dot_

 he s young enough and has enough appeal that he that he could drop out for the sake of the party and run virtually unopposed in four or eight years _meta_end_dot_

 moe i don t think anyone buys the popular vote including mi fl as is _meta_end_dot_

 that s because it would be hillary _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ obama _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 no one is buying that _meta_end_dot_

 the fl vote totals are realistic enough she can act like they are real mi is not _meta_end_dot_

 pejman yousefzadeh i agree with the general consensus that if obama wins pa the i am not sure that he can win pa especially with the events of last of that that would bring all of this to an end is if the and since when are democrats that organized _meta_end_question_

 i am actually beginning to think that we have a good chance of winning
