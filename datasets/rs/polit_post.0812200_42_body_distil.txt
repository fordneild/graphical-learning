  obviously _meta_number_ref_ _meta_percent_ref_ growth in gdp is nothing to write home about but it beats a contraction _meta_end_dot_

 i know that now the predictions are that we will have a contraction later in the spring or in the summer but i wonder whether we might have survived the worst of the credit crunch even allowing for the fact that indicators are lagging and will see very slow growth for the first part of the year with faster growth later on _meta_end_dot_

 this is all just speculation so don t take it to the bank and i mean that literally but having fully expected to hear that the economy has contracted i feel somewhat more optimistic about the long term _meta_end_dot_

 here s hoping i don t have to eat these words _meta_end_dot_
