 why other than that we re once again discussing whether mormons are christians something this site forbids _meta_end_question_

 go to _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ for why _meta_end_dot_

 thomas the associated press reports republican presidential candidate mike huckabee questions mormons belief _meta_end_dot_

 in an article to be published in sunday s new york times magazine huckabee asks we will have to wait until the weekend to see if the times magazine provides some legitimate context for the headline grabbing quote _meta_end_dot_

 in the meantime even though it s hard not to jump to the conclusion that huckabee is questioning mormons beliefs we should give huckabee the benefit of the doubt or at least an opportunity to explain _meta_end_dot_

 it is possible that huckabee managed to fall into a clever political religious trap _meta_end_dot_

 it is also possible that he was trying to set such a trap _meta_end_dot_

 it seems highly unlikely that huckabee would engage in such a dirty trick as the huckaboom continues to gain momentum _meta_end_dot_

 i m sure the church of jesus christ of latter day saints can adequately defend mormon beliefs while we wait _meta_end_dot_
