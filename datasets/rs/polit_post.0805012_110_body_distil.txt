 said it before and i ll say it again _meta_end_dot_

 what a difference a party makes _meta_end_dot_

 while barack obama and hillary clinton continue to sling mud make wild accusations and personal attacks against one another drag american politics further into the gutter and all while telling michigan voters to take a flying leap the republicans look down right civil _meta_end_dot_

 our primary contest is all but officially over _meta_end_dot_

 when we debated one another it was almost exclusively on the issues _meta_end_dot_

 do you remember any of the campaigns intentionally and maliciously raising the mormon spectre against one time front runner mitt romney the way clinton s camp has raised the muslim question re barack _meta_end_question_

 the _meta_number_ref_ presidential campaign really has been and continues to be a tale of two parties especially here in the wolverine state _meta_end_dot_

 campaign styles differ _meta_end_dot_

 clearly policy objectives and messages differ _meta_end_dot_

 but the biggest difference of them all is the way moms and dads and factory workers and union laborers and the unemployed and kids and churches and job makers and families have been treated in michigan _meta_end_dot_

 one party has abandoned us completely _meta_end_dot_

 the other _meta_end_question_

 we tend to get a little more love _meta_end_dot_

 in fact while the left dukes it out over who s a more liberal united states senator the detroit news reports that john mccain is coming back to michigan _meta_end_dot_

 again _meta_end_dot_

 as if he actually cares about the state or something _meta_end_dot_

 john mccain has scheduled a michigan day that will hopefully open his eyes a little bit more to what s happening here _meta_end_dot_

 to why we re struggling so mightily under jennifer granholm s failed leadership to forward thinking solutions even when they re tough _meta_end_dot_

 it s not just a whilste stop campaign tour on the back of the straight talk express _meta_end_dot_

 it s substance and nuance and genuine interest _meta_end_dot_

 obama and clinton meanwhile continue to hold michigan at arms length as if we had a smelly diaper _meta_end_dot_

 they won t come here _meta_end_dot_

 they won t ask for a single vote _meta_end_dot_

 but that s not new and unfortunately the michigan democrats have gotten used to it over the last several months _meta_end_dot_

 it doesn t even bother them anymore _meta_end_dot_

 a candidate doesn t have to ask for their vote _meta_end_dot_

 they re partisans first michiganders second and if there s a d attached to a name they ll punch that ballot period _meta_end_dot_

 which is a shame _meta_end_dot_

 because until you give candidates an incentive to pay attention to your home town and your issues _meta_end_dot_

 guess what _meta_end_dot_

 they won t _meta_end_dot_

 and if there s one state that deserves a little attention right now it s ours _meta_end_dot_

 think the _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ chrysler employees who had until yesterday to apply for one of about _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ buyouts read job terminations could use a voice and a listening ear _meta_end_question_

 well they ll get one from senator mccain two days from now _meta_end_dot_

 they might not get one from a democrat nominee in the next five full years _meta_end_dot_

 freep reports good bet it s a big number _meta_end_dot_

 at least four figures _meta_end_dot_

 could be five _meta_end_dot_

 think their families aren t hurting over the decision _meta_end_question_

 as if there isn t enough already trying to kick in our teeth _meta_end_dot_

 heck even our gas prices are going up again _meta_end_dot_

 according to the ap lowest prices are in lansing _meta_end_question_

 what s the deal _meta_end_question_

 gas companies trying to convince lawmakers that things really aren t that bad _meta_end_question_

 a _meta_number_ref_ some odd percent jump in prices over the span of one year is bad boys and girls _meta_end_dot_

 period _meta_end_dot_

 and andy dillon if you re reading _meta_end_dot_

 with natural spikes in prices like these _meta_end_dot_

 november probably won t be a good time to vote to raise the gas tax again _meta_end_dot_

 just saying br
