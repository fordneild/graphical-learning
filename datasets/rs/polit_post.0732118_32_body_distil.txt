  doffing my cap to erick s post below i have a quick reflection to add _meta_end_dot_

 neither fred thompson nor mitt romney unless they ve changed their minds will propose a right to life amendment or anything federalizing abortion _meta_end_dot_

 neither will a party platform _meta_end_dot_

 it is up to congress and nothing has been happening there _meta_end_dot_

 the currently heralded _meta_number_ref_ republican party platform reads on this matter what amendment _meta_end_question_

 it was up to congress to propose _meta_end_dot_

 the platform continued the latter not requiring a consensus of the three fourths of the state legislatures is much more doable and has been done _meta_end_dot_

 and will continue to be done _meta_end_dot_

 but president reagan did not strongly push the amendment and congress brought nothing of import _meta_end_dot_

 the plank was a laudable goal as is much of what comprises a party platform but it was not a true draft of policy much less legislation _meta_end_dot_

 but it can be something meaningless but contentious when argued out of context on a sunday morning talk show _meta_end_dot_

 read more here s russert and thompson on the november _meta_number_ref_ edition of nbc s meet the press back to pre roe _meta_end_dot_

 the _meta_number_ref_ gop platform said on this matter what amendment _meta_end_question_

 that will be up to congress not to fred thompson rudy giuliani john mccain mike huckabee or mitt romney _meta_end_dot_

 as erick pointed out romney opposed the hla before he supported it as the nuance abounded and it seems to be that romney would be better served my backing away from this one quickly _meta_end_dot_

 he s in no house from which to hurl stones let alone a mountain from which to lob thunderbolts on this matter _meta_end_dot_

 writing for the human life review in _meta_number_ref_ as reprinted by national review online in _meta_number_ref_ president ronald reagan gave his take on life and federal action regarding it _meta_end_dot_

 he praised legislation prohibiting the federal government from performing abortions or assisting those who do so except to save the life of the mother he continued president reagan admitted that an hla amendment would be difficult perhaps beyond his reach _meta_end_dot_

 he might have been more reluctant to embrace the federalism on this issue endorsed by thompson and romney because of his own experiences therewith _meta_end_dot_

 so again we have reagan and thompson in the same basic camp _meta_end_dot_

 rudy s building his own camp dammit and that s how it s going to be _meta_end_dot_

 huckabee is huckabee _meta_end_dot_

 hugh morning glory but i m not sure if you are really defending romney or just the emanations of the penumbra of your campaign bio this is not about the human life amendment _meta_end_dot_

 this is presidential politics and once everything is calmly and rationally explained i suspect most republicans will agree with fred thompson in his context and ronald reagan in his _meta_end_dot_

 and huckabee and as far he stands currently mitt romney _meta_end_dot_
