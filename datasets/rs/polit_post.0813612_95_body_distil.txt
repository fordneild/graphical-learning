  and let me depress our democratic lurkers a bit by noting that we re only at the halfway point of it _meta_end_dot_

 good times good times _meta_end_dot_

 anyway there are some things missing and i have to admit i m curious where they are _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 polls for montana south dakota and especially puerto rico _meta_end_dot_

 the default media assumptions are that senator obama is going to win the first two because he won the caucus states around them and that senator clinton will win the last one because it s full of people who speak spanish _meta_end_dot_

 on the other hand montana and south dakota are primary contests full of working class white people which is a demographic group that obama is busily losing at levels not seen since walter mondale and the media folks reporting on puerto rico are generally from mainland usa which means that they almost certainly don t speak spanish themselves thus making it hard for them to check _meta_end_dot_

 some actual you know polls would be helpful here people _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 about those april _meta_number_ref_ fundraising totals hillary barack pretty miserable for you both huh _meta_end_question_

 no _meta_end_question_

 so what were they _meta_end_question_

 it s may freaking _meta_number_ref_th already and neither of you could be made to shut up about the billions and billions of money you raked up in december january february march _meta_end_dot_

 what _meta_end_question_

 sorry no john s taking public money for the general and our race is over anyway _meta_end_dot_

 you two are still in this one _meta_end_dot_

 so come on already _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 a senior democrat strategist familiar with discussions at the highest levels of the obama camp has revealed that mr obama is now confident of the support of around _meta_number_ref_ of the remaining _meta_number_ref_ undeclared superdelegates _meta_end_dot_

 yeah _meta_end_dot_

 how is that going anyway _meta_end_question_

 i mean given that _meta_percent_ref_ of clinton s supporters currently want her to do a third party bid if she doesn t get the nomination i think that delicacy about hurting her feelings hah _meta_end_exclamation_

 may need to take a back seat to stopping the bleeding now you think that maybe you want to get that list leaked senator _meta_end_question_

 note that there s always the possibility that i just missed any or all of this _meta_end_dot_

 but if the obsessive amateur political junkies can t find something _meta_end_dot_
