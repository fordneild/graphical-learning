  part of the political narrative this campaign season has been the argument that the vast sums of money raised by the remaining presidential candidates is indicative of the enthusiasm democrats feel for the upcoming election cycle _meta_end_dot_

 i suppose that there is some truth to that claim but i find it a little bit harder to believe especially after reading this that republicans suffer from a lack of enthusiasm so pronounced as to make them uncompetitive in the election _meta_end_dot_

 the democrats can claim that they haven t structured their party to raise and keep a large financial reserve but the ability republicans have to amass cash and president bush and vice president cheney will have their roles in amassing a whole lot more means that they will be able to coordinate with and assist john mccain s candidacy quite effectively _meta_end_dot_

 to be sure democrats will catch up when their party selects a nominee _meta_end_dot_

 but that could take a while from what i hear _meta_end_dot_

 and by the time it happens any increase in the party s coffers may be offset by the decrease in the coffers of the eventual nominee since gobs of money doubtlessly had to be spent to defeat the eventual nominee s remaining rival _meta_end_dot_
