  i always scratch my head at the purists among us _meta_end_dot_

 they won t go vote for john mccain because of their one little issue when objectively obama is to the left of him on that issue _meta_end_dot_

 but because john mccain dared to say something not nice about the purist s favorite position by god we are all traitors to the cause if we go vote for the man because he has sold us out _meta_end_dot_

 the argument of course is b s _meta_end_dot_

 some people are just too sensitive for politics _meta_end_dot_

 as krempasky said it ain t bean bag so as i would say suck it up _meta_end_dot_

 here again is another clear difference _meta_end_dot_

 mccain asked about judges has mentioned roberts and alito and scalia and thomas _meta_end_dot_

 here s a wolf blitzer exchange with obama on judges from may _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ decision on child pornography was decided _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 justices souter and ginsberg were in the minority _meta_end_dot_

 souter opposed the crack down on child pornography _meta_end_dot_

 heck even the liberal lion of the supreme court john paul stevens supported the law _meta_end_dot_

 oh wait stevens wasn t one of those obama liked _meta_end_dot_

 but souter and ginsberg were on the list _meta_end_dot_

 mccain matters on judges _meta_end_dot_

 you may not like him on a number of issues but he has not disappointed us on supporting conservative judges _meta_end_dot_

 and in this day and age we need good conservative judges _meta_end_dot_
