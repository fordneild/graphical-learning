  everything that is written in this story is true _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 up to a point _meta_end_dot_

 it is certainly the case that it would take an electoral miracle of unprecedented proportions to vault hillary clinton ahead of barack obama in terms of pledged delegates and the popular vote _meta_end_dot_

 and even an electoral miracle of unprecedented proportions may not be good enough _meta_end_dot_

 but that is not the aim of the clinton campaign _meta_end_dot_

 the aim of the clinton campaign is to get this contest to the point where neither clinton nor obama have the _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ delegates needed for the nomination and then for chaos to reign _meta_end_dot_

 the clintons whatever else one can say about them are exceedingly good in a knife fight _meta_end_dot_

 perhaps as jim vandehei and mike allen write that talent has been exaggerated for the purpose of propagating an interesting storyline _meta_end_dot_

 but it remains substantially true _meta_end_dot_

 and in the chaos of a brokered convention he or she who is good at a knife fight may be able to create an advantage _meta_end_dot_

 at the very least the knifer may be able to secure an excellent consolation prize _meta_end_dot_

 hillary clinton is not guaranteed to win in pennsylvania or for that matter indiana _meta_end_dot_

 but she has a good shot _meta_end_dot_

 and just as she stands no chance to win the magic _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ neither does obama _meta_end_dot_

 for that reason alone the clintons won t give up _meta_end_dot_

 they never do when there is a chance for power still existing _meta_end_dot_
