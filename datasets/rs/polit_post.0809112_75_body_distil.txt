  during the _meta_number_ref_ campaign no democrat could grant a print radio or television interview of more than a dozen words unless it contained the phrase culture of corruption capitalizing on republican congressional scandals like the outrageous graft of duke cunningham and the overblown scandal of mark foley democrats filtered every news event through the culture of corruption spin _meta_end_dot_

 they promised to end the culture of corruption if only the voters would elect them _meta_end_dot_

 the democrats rode the mantra to majorities in both houses _meta_end_dot_

 strangely just two years later the phrase culture of corruption has fallen into the same frequency of use as whale oil and buggy whips _meta_end_dot_

 this would be a sign of progress if democrats had indeed eradicated corruption as they promised _meta_end_dot_

 instead they have taken over the corruption franchise and expanded it exponentially _meta_end_dot_

 democrats don t dare mention culture of corruption lest the same platform that swept them into office should sweep them out again _meta_end_dot_

 still the electorate cannot help but notice the compulsion to corruption the democrats have recently demonstrated _meta_end_dot_

 the most glaring of course is the downfall of self proclaimed champion of justice eliot spitzer the new york attorney general and then governor who used his offices and government agencies to bully political opponents as often as he prosecuted wrong doers _meta_end_dot_

 when it came to light that he was just as likely to patronize the same sort of prostitution rings he was famous for prosecuting he resigned in disgrace _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 he was replaced by his lieutenant governor david paterson who immediately confessed to a previous extramarital affair during his first week in office _meta_end_dot_

 later both he and his current wife admitted to having affairs during their marriage _meta_end_dot_

 then paterson admitted he may have used campaign funds to pay for hotels in which he conducted such affairs a violation of state election laws _meta_end_dot_

 paterson a democrat is the current governor of new york _meta_end_dot_

 democrat presidential candidate hillary clinton has always had a reputation for prevarication but recently she s been working overtime to burnish it _meta_end_dot_

 the current example is her complete fabrication of landing under fire during a trip to bosnia while she was first lady _meta_end_dot_

 it turns out that the harrowing landing in a combat zone which she recounted on two occasions was complete fiction _meta_end_dot_

 mrs _meta_end_dot_

 clinton explained that she misspoke but there is no known instance of her landing under fire at any time so she could not have confused the incident with some other _meta_end_dot_

 she could only have confused the truth with untruth a chronic condition for mrs _meta_end_dot_

 clinton _meta_end_dot_

 another recent development is that senator clinton s campaign manager maggie williams was on the board of directors of delta financial one of the bankrupt sub prime lenders that mrs _meta_end_dot_

 clinton has blamed for the credit crunch falling home values and their disproportionate impact on low income families _meta_end_dot_

 mrs _meta_end_dot_

 clinton has consistently laid the blame for the sub prime meltdown at the feet of the bush administration but she need only have looked as far as her own staff _meta_end_dot_

 democrat presidential candidate barack obama has been mired in the controversy of his pastor jeremiah wright for the last couple of weeks _meta_end_dot_

 pastor wright used his pulpit at the trinity united church to convince his flock that black people will never get a fair shake from the united states that our government introduced the aids virus to destroy the black population to equate the wartime bombing of hiroshima with the spetember _meta_number_ref_th attacks and to justify palestinian terrorist attacks against israel _meta_end_dot_

 senator obama is a friend of the pastor attended trinity united for twenty years had his wedding ceremony performed by the pastor had his children baptized in the church and included the pastor on his campaign as a spiritual advisor _meta_end_dot_

 when the statements of the pastor came to the attention of the general public obama at first claimed he had never heard them then that he had never heard them personally then that he disagreed with them then that he disavowed them _meta_end_dot_

 each position was proven to be wholly or partially untrue _meta_end_dot_

 obama is a long time member of a church that preaches racial division anti americanism and pro terrorist sentiments _meta_end_dot_

 if he were truly unaware of the nature of the church he attended for twenty years and the views of his friend the pastor it is unlikely he has the perception and situational awareness required of the president of the united states _meta_end_dot_

 house speaker nancy pelosi who was able to get culture of corruption into almost every sentence she uttered during the _meta_number_ref_ campaign began her tenure by endorsing congressman jack murtha for house majority leader despite nagging accusations of his trading federal spending for campaign contributions dating back to the fbi s _meta_number_ref_ abscam bribery investigation _meta_end_dot_

 the abscam investigation was initiated by the carter administration with democrat majorities in the house and senate so it could never be characterized as a partisan case regarding her endorsement of murtha melanie sloan executive director of the democrat supportive group citizens for responsibility and ethics in washington said pelosi s endorsement suggests to me she was interested in the culture of corruption only as a campaign issue and has no real interest in true reform during the _meta_number_ref_ campaign democratic national committee chairman howard dean also steadily beat the culture of corruption drum castigating republicans who wrote letters on behalf of indian tribes represented by lobbyist jack abramoff _meta_end_dot_

 when asked by chris wallace on fox news sunday _meta_number_ref_ january _meta_number_ref_ if any democrats had acted in a similar fashion dean replied that s a big problem _meta_end_dot_

 and those democrats would be in trouble _meta_end_dot_

 and they should be in trouble but in _meta_number_ref_ senator harry reid now senate majority leader accepted several thousand dollars from the coushatta indian tribe an abramoff client and subsequently interceded at the department of the interior on the tribe s behalf in a casino dispute with a rival tribe _meta_end_dot_

 between _meta_number_ref_ and _meta_number_ref_ harry reid received a total of _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ in abramoff related donations not counting the coushatta money _meta_end_dot_

 so the party that ran on cleaning up the culture of corruption has in fact immersed itself in that very culture _meta_end_dot_

 current democratic congressional leadership nancy pelosi and harry reid as well as the two democrats competing for the party s presidential nomination barack obama and hillary clinton and the new york state house spitzer and paterson are all tainted with corruption and are hardly in a position to clean up after themselves _meta_end_dot_

 that will be the responsibility of voters in november _meta_end_dot_
