  last weekend i went to see the new chick flick p s _meta_end_dot_

 i love you i was in the mood for romantic cry fest and studs with irish accents but before i got a chance to use my tissues i saw this preview for a new anti war film called stop loss watch the trailer _meta_end_dot_

 read on _meta_end_dot_

 a prominent military expert told me that the problem goes back to the civil war in which the union army was cut by huge chunks at harvest times _meta_end_dot_

 we need it but it s ugly john kerry has been quoted saying this about the stop loss policy in _meta_number_ref_ wrote this article sighting the first soldier to challenge the legality of the policy s application to deployment in iraq _meta_end_dot_

 the washington post wrote in _meta_number_ref_ about the stop loss policy as well opinion is that if you are in the military and there is a war going on shouldnt one expect to serve until the war is over _meta_end_question_

 on the other hand if this policy is enacted or executed dishonestly by our government or president it will reflect negatively in the competence of our military now and later _meta_end_dot_

 stop loss has two faces the face of the men like the one depicted in this film decorated iraq war hero sgt _meta_end_dot_

 brandon king ryan philippe _meta_end_dot_

 king is still deserving of thanks and respect _meta_end_dot_

 there is the face of a warrior warriors like cpl _meta_end_dot_

 sean stokes who returned to iraq for his _meta_number_ref_rd tour voluntarily because he couldn t bear the thought of his fellow marines being someplace where he couldn t share the burden with them men who hide their wounds in order to avoid being medevaced _meta_end_dot_

 this film won t be in theatres until late march but it is sure to draw some more attention to the already controversial policy _meta_end_dot_

 nothing reaches out more to bleeding hearts than a poignant sound track graphics and a romantic plot _meta_end_dot_
