  either he does indeed owe austan goolsbee an apology or obama really is a protectionist and therefore antediluvian when it comes to trade issues _meta_end_dot_

 if the former then obama ought to issue his apology back nafta and free trade and announce his support for the u s colombia trade pact _meta_end_dot_

 if the latter then he should stop making protectionism sound like an affliction of the yokels who don t know better _meta_end_dot_

 he can t quite have it both ways now can he _meta_end_dot_

 as for the rest of obama s commentary on small towns in pennsylvania well i think that it will be very interesting to see just how much small town america likes being condescended to _meta_end_dot_

 you know even if people don t live in cities with skyscrapers they still vote _meta_end_dot_
