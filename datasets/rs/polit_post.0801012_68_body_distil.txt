  my what a difference a year makes _meta_end_dot_

 do you remember _meta_end_question_

 as _meta_number_ref_ dawned there was nothing but wailing and hand wringing on the matter of iraq _meta_end_dot_

 the worst of the left cheered joyously for defeat while even many on the right were going wobbly and looking for some only modestly bad way to make as un messy an exit as possible _meta_end_dot_

 to add insult to injury the democrats had recaptured both houses of congress and were itching to abandon the iraqis and surrender furthermore some collection of over the hill has beens known as the iraq study group had produced a bi partisan blueprint for that surrender _meta_end_dot_

 it was enough to remind one of the prophecies of delphic oracle to the athenians in _meta_number_ref_ b c after the persians had forced their way past thermopylae pass and were moving south as per herodotus the consensus was that giving up was not a matter of if but when and under what detailed circumstances _meta_end_dot_

 how could anyone talk about victory _meta_end_question_

 did anyone even consider the possibility of victory _meta_end_question_

 read on _meta_end_dot_

 actually at least one someone in fact did on january _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ in this forum _meta_end_dot_

 one year ago today your humble correspondent posted a lengthy essay entitled is iraq this war s guadalcanal _meta_end_question_

 the consequences of victory the opening flourish was the primary opening arguments were two fold _meta_end_dot_

 the first was that the iraq problem had fallen into the hole of washington navel gazing where it is believed that everything can be controlled deus ex machina from there as if on brute inanimate matter _meta_end_dot_

 the second was that iraq had not become a much more difficult problem because of anything we had done it was suggested that the core problem is that the enemy had unexpectedly and unwisely chosen to contest iraq with everything they could throw at it _meta_end_dot_

 was there some parallel from an earlier war in this guise _meta_end_question_

 the essay suggested that there was guadalcanal in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 on august _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ in a hastily re directed operation the first marine division went ashore on guadalcanal and seized a partially completed japanese airfield _meta_end_dot_

 guadalcanal had considerable strategic potential to the japanese due to its proximity to the lines of communication between the united states and australia however it was a very far flung japanese holding at the end of a very long and tenuous logistical string _meta_end_dot_

 as i wrote last year the japanese made a grievous mistake in deciding to so vigorously contest such a distant and peripheral outpost and for this hubris they suffered a grievous and catastrophic defeat _meta_end_dot_

 to underline the extent of the catastrophe for imperial japan i quoted the memoirs of japan s most accomplished flyer to survive the war saburo sakai who after being badly wounded in an early air battle over guadalcanal returned to japan and became a staff officer _meta_end_dot_

 and i answered sakai s rhetorical question thusly and what of iraq _meta_end_question_

 that sounded pretty outlandish one year ago but it turned out to be pretty much spot on didn t it _meta_end_question_

 and amid much talk at the time that the objective was a civic reconstruction of iraqi society the argument was made that the objective should be to find and destroy the enemy _meta_end_dot_

 to wit this is basically what general petraeus and our troops have done _meta_end_dot_

 though there were extra troops and other very positive changes in strategy the main and possibly still unappreciated aspect of general petraeus strategy was to defeat the enemy as all other objectives could only follow that achievement _meta_end_dot_

 this is how you win and this seems to have worked _meta_end_dot_

 is this battle won and over _meta_end_question_

 in warfare of this kind history shows that insurgencies don t reach well defined ends with either surrender ceremonies or the signing of a peace agreement insurgencies tend to go to defeat almost adiabatically slowly fading away _meta_end_dot_

 that seems to be happening but of course we face a clever and ruthless enemy _meta_end_dot_

 they may try to regroup and make yet another push back in iraq _meta_end_dot_

 or they may decide that the time is ripe in potentially greener pastures _meta_end_dot_

 one strangely prescient but ominous comment last year was to note that this no longer seems to be holding _meta_end_dot_

 the enemy may be in the process of concluding that iraq has become a costly symbol that now offers little while pakistan might be a more worthwhile investment of time and effort due both to pakistan s much larger population and of course its small nuclear arsenal _meta_end_dot_

 and some old instincts developed over the past more than twenty years just keep tingling in my mind that at some point something robust will have to be done in lebanon s beka a valley _meta_end_dot_

 to close this hopefully not too immodest retrospective i d urge everyone who finds the time to link back and read last year s essay to continue down and read through the forty comments that it generated _meta_end_dot_

 those are perhaps even more interesting reading than the essay itself _meta_end_dot_

 oh one last thing that we need to be sure that we understand _meta_end_dot_

 during the six month long struggle for guadalcanal things were touch and go _meta_end_dot_

 however viewed after the fact there is one clarion point that needs to be understood at no point were we losing _meta_end_dot_

 one year ago and too often this year there was a strange belief that we were losing the war _meta_end_dot_

 there have been very tough stretches where it seemed that things were going nowhere that much is true but at no time were we or have we been losing the war _meta_end_dot_

 the enemy has been able to create mayhem but at no time was there even the remotest chance that they could drive us from the field _meta_end_dot_

 as vince lombardi said winning isn t everything it s the only thing let s make sure that this one stays won _meta_end_dot_

 update i hashed that together last night for posting this morning this morning there is a surprisingly similar in tone if not content one year review by senators mccain and lieberman _meta_end_dot_

 i ll just provide a couple of quotes here that jibe with this discourse and the one from one year ago _meta_end_dot_

 victory _meta_end_dot_
