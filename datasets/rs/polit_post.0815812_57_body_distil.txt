  now that the democratic primary is finally over and hillary has admitted defeat or at least agreed to a phased withdrawal or whatever allow me to throw something out there that i have been thinking about lately _meta_end_dot_

 was bill clinton right when he claimed that the obama campaign played the race card on him _meta_end_question_

 the conventional wisdom has always been that the former president used race to try and diminish obama in south carolina and it backfired _meta_end_dot_

 then when asked about it he ridiculously claimed that the infamous race card had been played against him _meta_end_dot_

 but i am coming around to bill s side of things _meta_end_dot_

 this new perspective comes from having read a bound man why we are excited about obama and why he can t win by shelby steele _meta_end_dot_

 steele s book is well worth your time for its insights into the issue of race in america and into the unique position of barack obama as a presidential candidate _meta_end_dot_

 for an explanation of why obama had to play the race card read on _meta_end_dot_

 i am going to oversimplify to a degree here so please read the book for a fuller explanation _meta_end_dot_

 but steele basically argues that there are two types of african american figures in mainstream american culture or two distinct ways in which they relate to american mainstream society the bargainer and the challenger _meta_end_dot_

 first the bargainer in contrast the challenger you might recognize such figures as bill cosby collin powell and oprah winfrey as classic bargainers and figures like al sharpton and jesse jackson as challengers _meta_end_dot_

 the most successful bargainers in american life often reach the status of what steele calls the iconic negro and again oprah is the classic example a figure beloved by millions and one whose imprint can make or break a venture _meta_end_dot_

 clearly obama has taken on this mantle in the realm of politics _meta_end_dot_

 in fact oprah signified as much by traveling with him and stumping for him early in the primary _meta_end_dot_

 and clearly obama acts as a symbol for a lot of folks not of specific policies but of a better racial future for america a sense that we have risen above the ugliness of racism _meta_end_dot_

 in return for his making them feel better about themselves they feel a profound gratitude and connection to him _meta_end_dot_

 this has to be a great asset for obama right _meta_end_question_

 yes but there is a wrinkle in this scenario and hence the title and subtitle of the book _meta_end_dot_

 the black community is inherently suspicious of bargainers _meta_end_dot_

 if racial guilt is the only tool they have to make their way in mainstream society any movement to deny the pervasive role of racism weakens the community s power _meta_end_dot_

 this explains the near constant grumbling about those popular african americans who refuse to use their position to castigate whites about racism see tiger woods or recently bill cosby _meta_end_dot_

 steele argues that this puts obama in a difficult situation this in fact played itself out early in the primary with questions about obama being black enough and his early lack of widespread support among african americans _meta_end_dot_

 again the conventional wisdom holds that it was bill clinton s awkward racialism and a recognition that obama could actually win that caused the african american community to rally behind obama to such a overwhelming degree _meta_end_dot_

 i have no doubt that these factors did play a role but i think obama was more active than just reactive in this strategy _meta_end_dot_

 i think obama was well aware of the difficult position he was in and acted to change it _meta_end_dot_

 i think that just as obama went to chicago seeking to immerse himself in the african american community so he could embrace that identity and erase his own doubts so too did he go to south carolina and campaign as the black candidate so as to become the symbol of this community something he had avoided previously _meta_end_dot_

 and in order to balance the tension between his status as a bargainer and as a symbol of the black community he sought to goad the clinton campaign into making race an issue to tempt them into talking about race _meta_end_dot_

 he had as an aide the compliance of the media who are as racially pc as can be imagined _meta_end_dot_

 bill clinton foolishly allowed himself to fall for this temptation and thus cost his wife dearly _meta_end_dot_

 obama could not do anything as obvious as call bill racist _meta_end_dot_

 instead obama did what he has done throughout the campaign he had his staff and the media fan the flames while he attempted to remain above it all _meta_end_dot_

 when bill clinton attacked obama s claims of being an early and consistent opponent of the iraq war as a fairy tale many obama supporters in and out of the media jumped on it as racially loaded even though it was clearly about the war not race _meta_end_dot_

 likewise i don t really think hillary was implying anything racial insensitive in her clumsy remarks about the need for lbj to enact civil rights legislation that mlk inspired _meta_end_dot_

 but she too was immediately attacked _meta_end_dot_

 remember hillary too campaigned in black churches in her senate races and had strong support among african american leaders _meta_end_dot_

 obama mostly stayed above all of this but his staff was passive aggressive in both dismissing it and yet making it clear that it was offensive and out of bounds _meta_end_dot_

 this led to an environment where obama supporters began to feel like the clintons would do or say anything to tear down obama _meta_end_dot_

 this fed perfectly into the media storyline about bill and hillary and so the perception quickly grew _meta_end_dot_

 the clinton campaign really just wanted to go after obama s pose as a squeaky clean or different kind of politician _meta_end_dot_

 bill was angry that hillary s campaign was being run so poorly and that her staff seemed unwilling or unable to take the fight to obama _meta_end_dot_

 he insisted against their advice to go to south carolina and campaign for his wife _meta_end_dot_

 also adding to the emotion was the feeling that obama was stealing bill s persona to defeat his wife _meta_end_dot_

 after all bill was the next great thing of the democratic party once the fresh young outsider who could give a great speech _meta_end_dot_

 and bill clinton s career owed a great deal to his ability to reach out to african americans and seek to bridge the racial divide _meta_end_dot_

 an obama win meant all those years of working to build up this support could be dashed by this arrogant upstart barely out of the state senate _meta_end_dot_

 it was with all of this as background that bill fell into obama s trap _meta_end_dot_

 bill went around the state attacking obama _meta_end_dot_

 he got angry and wagged his finger _meta_end_dot_

 most foolishly he got in a angry fight with representative james e _meta_end_dot_

 clyburn _meta_end_dot_

 at the same time obama was campaigning in black churches and using the style and idiom of that community in a way he hadn t or couldn t in place like iowa and new hampshire _meta_end_dot_

 cinque henderson lays out the sly strategy all of this involved and this was the moment that the tables turned on the clintons _meta_end_dot_

 once someone accused bill clinton of racism what did you think his reaction would be _meta_end_question_

 calm patient discussion and an attempt to defuse the situation _meta_end_question_

 ahh no _meta_end_dot_

 he fired back angrier than ever _meta_end_dot_

 going so far as to get in a shouting vulgarity filled argument on the phone with clyburn _meta_end_dot_

 when he tried to compare obama s win to jesse jackson s the story line was cemented _meta_end_dot_

 and of course bill only got more defensive _meta_end_dot_

 but he seemed unable to see that by getting angry and fighting about it in the media he only reinforced the perception of him as out of control _meta_end_dot_

 if obama had really played the race card on him voicing the accusation served only to make bill look all that more foolish _meta_end_dot_

 i honestly believe that the obama campaign wanted race to become an issue in south carolina and that they allowed bill clinton and the media to make obama appear to be the victim of racial attacks _meta_end_dot_

 because once obama became a victim of racism all the questions about his own racial loyalty among the african american community went away _meta_end_dot_

 he was a black man being attacked by a white man _meta_end_dot_

 and of course obama was soon winning this crucial democratic demographic by overwhelming margins _meta_end_dot_

 in fact he could not have won the nomination without such overwhelming support _meta_end_dot_

 if the african american vote gets split to any degree obama loses _meta_end_dot_

 instead he won those votes nearly _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ in the aftermath of south carolina and this allowed him to build the lead that would carry him through hillary s last charge _meta_end_dot_

 for reference hillary won _meta_percent_ref_ of the african american vote in her _meta_number_ref_ senate re election race according to this exit poll now that obama is safely portrayed as the symbol of the african american community he has the ability to break out of the bind that steele describes _meta_end_dot_

 no longer does he have to worry about being black enough _meta_end_dot_

 but he can also continue to portray himself as the harbinger of racial unity and peace at the same time _meta_end_dot_

 he can continue to be the oprah of politics steele s iconic negro and this is exactly how the media portrayed him this week _meta_end_dot_

 there is another hurdle still out there for obama his hidebound liberalism but that is the subject of another post _meta_end_dot_
