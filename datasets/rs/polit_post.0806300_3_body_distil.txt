  i ll be the first to tell anyone that barack obama is a highly intelligent highly talented individual who is a very good campaigner _meta_end_dot_

 he also appears to be a nice guy as politicians go who is comfortable in his own skin _meta_end_dot_

 it s hard to dislike someone like that _meta_end_dot_

 none of that however should serve as any kind of camouflage for the fact that he has one of the thinnest and least substantive records of any presidential candidate in a long time _meta_end_dot_

 and yes george w _meta_end_dot_

 bush brought a bigger resume to the white house _meta_end_dot_

 your honor i call david ignatius to the stand obama likes to glide past this inconvenient truth by claiming that his critics simply want him to stay in washington so that they can boil the hope out of him it s a nice line but it really shouldn t cover up matters _meta_end_dot_

 the fact is that obama s record of accomplishment is inversely proportional to the intensity of his political ambitions _meta_end_dot_

 your honor i call todd spivak to the stand _meta_end_dot_

 more underneath the fold _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 this isn t exactly change we can believe in now is it _meta_end_question_

 i mean i hear that lyndon johnson was quite a screamer and richard nixon had a long memory for political enemies too nyet _meta_end_question_

 years in hyde park as a middle school and high school student here and as a college and graduate school student at a certain university in hyde park as well _meta_end_dot_

 i know hyde park and i know that the people who work for the hyde park herald are not not vrwc types _meta_end_dot_

 quite the contrary they are obama types _meta_end_dot_

 they are good and big government liberals who are very passionate and idealistic _meta_end_dot_

 most of them went for howard dean the last time around _meta_end_dot_

 now they are going for one of their own barack obama lives in hyde park and was a lecturer at the university of chicago law school _meta_end_dot_

 people like todd spivak should be naturally predisposed to writing something exceedingly kind and nice about barack obama even though spivak doesn t appear to be living in hyde park anymore _meta_end_dot_

 nyet if emil jones were running for president i suppose that my objections to a thin resume would be lessened considerably _meta_end_dot_

 but he s not is he _meta_end_question_

 i m ignoring spivak _meta_end_dot_

 back to him now i know what the obamaniacs are going to say _meta_end_dot_

 they are going to say that barack obama is not your typical politician and that if he really wanted to do well as opposed to doing good he would have taken a six figure salary job out of law school instead of being a poorly paid community organizer _meta_end_dot_

 to some extent they may have a point but let s all try to remember that barack obama always saw community organizing as a stepping stone to bigger and better things and just because one calls oneself an activist it does not mean that one is actually engaged in activism there he is engaged big floppy hats demagoguery on the issue of race and pistol brandishing in the city council not to mention other things is not change we can believe in now read the following _meta_end_dot_

 if you do things like replacing the name barack obama with james baker or ted olson you might think that you were reading a bitter account of the florida recount controversy after reading all of the above one can t help but wonder what might have happened if spivak actually did what obama wanted and called his cell phone _meta_end_dot_

 at best he would have gotten another pretty speech _meta_end_dot_

 but at the end of the day no amount of pretty speeches fill the holes in a record and a resume that looks like swiss cheese _meta_end_dot_
