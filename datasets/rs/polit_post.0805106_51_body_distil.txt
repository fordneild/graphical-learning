  fidel castro has stepped down _meta_end_dot_

 brad delong quite properly kicks castro while the latter is likely on his deathbed and he gives his stupidest man alive award to someone who is not a republican _meta_end_dot_

 will wonders never cease _meta_end_question_

 usually having an r next to one s name was enough independent of all other factors was enough to ensure that one won delong s scorn _meta_end_dot_

 the good professor writes post after post after post declaiming that institutions that offend brad delong ought to be banned from existence _meta_end_dot_

 this includes not just the republican party but the new york times and the washington post i am sure that i forgot a few things that ought to be censored in a delongian universe _meta_end_dot_

 i know that chris bertram s apologia for castro is ridiculous and appalling beyond measure but the stars must have been aligned for delong to unleash the rage he usually reserves for republicans no _meta_end_question_

 of course we can t win them all _meta_end_dot_

 check out the comments in which people appear more than sympathetic to bertram and castro _meta_end_dot_

 why oh why oh why oh why oh why oh why oh why oh why oh why oh why can t brad delong have better readers _meta_end_question_
