  having blasted the house gop this week let me praise them today _meta_end_dot_

 they got fed up with the democrats playing games with the lives of our troops _meta_end_dot_

 the democrats in pushing their war supplemental highlighted their real priorities _meta_end_dot_

 in order they were tax increases on the entrepreneurial class spending on liberal social programs tying the hands of the commander in chief and screwing the war criminals in iraq troops _meta_end_dot_

 the gop did the only thing left they could do they refused to participate in the game _meta_end_dot_

 instead of even voting no they voted present _meta_end_dot_

 it had a lot of people scratching their heads but these people paid attention and asked why _meta_end_dot_

 and again the answer is simple the democrats are playing games with the lives of our soldiers in harm s way _meta_end_dot_

 they do not want to fund the troops but they know they have to _meta_end_dot_

 so they are trying to fund everything else first and daring the president to veto the funding _meta_end_dot_

 he will _meta_end_dot_

 he should _meta_end_dot_

 and the gop continues to be the party that stands up for the troops _meta_end_dot_

 here s roy blunt on the matter_meta_beep_ref_br
