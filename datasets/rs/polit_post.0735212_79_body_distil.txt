  the european central bank ecb has been creating unusually high amounts of liquidity in recent days _meta_end_dot_

 yesterday they completed a main refinancing operation that added just under _meta_number_ref_ billion euros equivalent to about _meta_number_ref_ billion dollars to europe s banking system _meta_end_dot_

 tomorrow they intend to sell _meta_number_ref_ billion us dollars in an attempt to improve dollar liquidity which is also quite constrained in europe these days _meta_end_dot_

 the federal reserve has also been busy auctioning off _meta_dollor_ref_ billion in new year end loans yesterday _meta_end_dot_

 as i ve noted before the end of the year is a very tricky time in the banking industry because everyone has to close their books and they often need to be more liquid than usual during the process _meta_end_dot_

 but why are europe s and america s money markets so strained in the first place _meta_end_question_

 and is there anything the federal reserve and the european central bank can really do about it _meta_end_question_

 more _meta_end_dot_

 the super sized ecb operation that completed yesterday had the effect of lending a bit more than _meta_number_ref_ billion euros at an interest rate of _meta_number_ref_ _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 the duration of the loans is _meta_number_ref_ days and they will expire in january _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 in the banking world the calendar has _meta_number_ref_ days _meta_end_dot_

 trust me it makes all of the math easier the _meta_number_ref_ _meta_percent_ref_ rate was a bid size weighted average of bids from _meta_number_ref_ institutions _meta_end_dot_

 the raw bids ranged from about _meta_percent_ref_ to _meta_number_ref_ _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 why does that matter _meta_end_question_

 well the ecb s target rate for short term interbank borrowings the equivalent of our fed funds target rate is now _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 the ecb wants it lower to spur economic growth but has held off because of raging inflation especially in germany _meta_end_dot_

 and in fact the ecb engaged in an open market operation on monday that drained cash but rates for interbank borrowing euribor and libor have been running far above the target ranging between _meta_number_ref_ _meta_percent_ref_ and _meta_number_ref_ _meta_percent_ref_ on recent days _meta_end_dot_

 the fact that yesterday s ecb auction was oversubscribed at _meta_number_ref_ _meta_percent_ref_ shows that demand for short term money is perfectly healthy in europe _meta_end_dot_

 but the fact that the prevailing market rate is so much higher indicates that there is an extremely unhealthy reluctance to lend _meta_end_dot_

 we may find out something similar in the us tomorrow _meta_end_dot_

 the fed s unusual auction yesterday sought to lend _meta_dollor_ref_ billion for a period of _meta_number_ref_ days at a mininum interest rate of _meta_number_ref_ _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 they ll announce preliminary results from the auction tomorrow morning so we ll see what we get then _meta_end_dot_

 but market reaction during the hours of the auction yesterday was sour _meta_end_dot_

 now it s one thing for central banks to intervene in money markets to keep them liquid and orderly around challenging events like the year end closing _meta_end_dot_

 as the designated lenders of last resort that s the primary job that central banks are supposed to do _meta_end_dot_

 but more to the point why are the markets so tight and what will it take to open them up _meta_end_question_

 these questions bring us to explore the limits of central bank activity _meta_end_dot_

 banks are unusually reluctant to lend to other institutions because of uncertainty that their counterparties will be able to pay them back _meta_end_dot_

 uncertainty is not the same as risk _meta_end_dot_

 risk can be quantified managed and hedged _meta_end_dot_

 uncertainty can t and of course the counterparty uncertainty comes from questions about the quality of their asset portfolios particularly of mortgage backed securities and other structured finance products _meta_end_dot_

 phew _meta_end_dot_

 you just knew the m word had to make an appearance eventually as i ve stressed in innumerable redstate posts when bankers and other investors feel uncertain they reduce their exposure _meta_end_dot_

 they concentrate on more liquid shorter term safer assets like us government debt and they make fewer commercial loans _meta_end_dot_

 and reducing the amount of credit available for business expansion is the one sure fire way to cause economic slowdowns and recessions _meta_end_dot_

 that s the reason to worry about the banking situation _meta_end_dot_

 impaired credit formation is the channel through which stress in the financial system gets transmitted from wall street to main street _meta_end_dot_

 signs of slowing output are strongly in evidence in many reports of business conditions prices for commodities etc _meta_end_dot_

 they have not yet made an appearance in official gdp measurements here or in europe or in job creation here _meta_end_dot_

 we re all waiting on pins and needles for this to happen or not to happen which is why the outlook is so uncertain _meta_end_dot_

 now what happens if uncertainty prevails among bankers and investors to the point that credit formation remains weak in the years ahead _meta_end_question_

 to say years is not far fetched _meta_end_dot_

 during the depression business lending remained at extremely depressed levels well into the late thirties and is the real reason the depression dragged on as long as it did what can the fed and ecb do about that _meta_end_question_

 not a heck of a lot _meta_end_dot_

 you can pump all the liquidity you want into the system but if there is no real economic activity available to absorb it it s going to slosh onto the floor _meta_end_dot_

 in other words we ll only get a lot of inflation _meta_end_dot_

 and isn t it curious that inflation is now high and rising everywhere but japan _meta_end_question_

 you can lead an investor to risk but you can t make him drink it _meta_end_dot_

 until someone figures out how to get investors off the sidelines economic growth in the west will face a headwind _meta_end_dot_

 we may have to wait until all the effects of the mortgage financing debacle wash out _meta_end_dot_

 and even then someone will have to go first _meta_end_dot_

 and investors as a rule don t like doing that _meta_end_dot_

 as an old wall street adage has it you can always spot a leader he s the guy with arrows in his back _meta_end_dot_
