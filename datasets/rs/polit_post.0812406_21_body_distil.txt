  since so much of the recent economic news has been poor it is easy to make too much of anything that might slightly resemble good news _meta_end_dot_

 but perhaps at long last we finally have some good news to cheer us _meta_end_dot_

 first there is the fact that wall street is feeling more confident these days we re not out of the woods just yet and in the past there have been false bouts of economic optimism as the story notes _meta_end_dot_

 still financial indicator instruments are quite advanced and it is to be hoped that the optimism currently being felt is not for naught _meta_end_dot_

 and indeed it does appear that it many ways the economy is holding its own the employment figures are better than expected as well especially when we consider the fact that we are in a low growth potentially recessionary period _meta_end_dot_

 for purposes of comparison recall that bill clinton got re elected in _meta_number_ref_ with _meta_number_ref_ _meta_percent_ref_ unemployment something to bear in mind in this election season as we are likely told that unemployment is the worst it has been since the great depression or something like that _meta_end_dot_

 i am not pollyannish about the economy _meta_end_dot_

 it could most certainly be better _meta_end_dot_

 but again it could also be a great deal worse _meta_end_dot_

 and while unhatched chickens should not be counted there is at least some cause for hope that we have seen the worst of whatever economic downturn we have experienced _meta_end_dot_

 as always here s hoping i haven t jinxed anything _meta_end_dot_
