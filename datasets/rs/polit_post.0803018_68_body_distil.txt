  the baptists are coming _meta_end_dot_

 the baptists are coming _meta_end_dot_

 but these aren t your real baptists _meta_end_dot_

 these are the religious left masquerading as evangelicals _meta_end_dot_

 allegedly _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ of them are meeting in atlanta this week _meta_end_dot_

 don t actually believe that though _meta_end_dot_

 i ve got a number of sources within this group who tell me that internally the numbers have fallen well short of expectations but if they send out a press release saying _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ the media will report it _meta_end_dot_

 this is important because the democrats are trying to get back into the faith game _meta_end_dot_

 they have decided to wage a fight against the southern baptist convention and legitimate principled organizations of faith _meta_end_dot_

 in essence jimmy carter and bill clinton are trying to build a base of religious voters for the democratic nominee _meta_end_dot_

 and who is helping them _meta_end_question_

 porker in chief chuck grassley the openly closeted senator from south carolina lindsey graham and green con artist al gore _meta_end_dot_

 gore s attendence is obvious _meta_end_dot_

 graham and grassley helped organize the thing and are participating because they want to assist in marginalizing the christian right something they see as a pernicious influence in politics _meta_end_dot_

 the issues discussed sum up where they are headed now all of this brings me back to michael gerson who has wanted the republican party to take on all of this under its umbrella really become a christian democrat party _meta_end_dot_

 a friend reminded me of a passage from one of my favorite books _meta_end_dot_

 i will stop here now and just let screwtape tell you the rest read on _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 looking round your patient s new friends i find that the best point of attack would be the border line between theology and politics _meta_end_dot_

 several of his new friends are very much alive to the social implications of their religion _meta_end_dot_

 that in itself is a bad thing but good can be made out of it _meta_end_dot_

 you will find that a good many christian political writers think that christianity began going wrong and departing from the doctrine of its founder at a very early stage _meta_end_dot_

 now this idea must be used by us to encourage once again the conception of a historical jesus to be found by clearing away later accretions and perversions and then to be contrasted with the whole christian tradition _meta_end_dot_

 in the last generation we promoted the construction of such a historical jesus on liberal and humanitarian lines we are now putting forward a new historical jesus on marxian catastrophic and revolutionary lines _meta_end_dot_

 the advantages of these constructions which we intend to change every thirty years or so are manifold _meta_end_dot_

 in the first place they all tend to direct men s devotion to something which does not exist for each historical jesus is unhistorical _meta_end_dot_

 the documents say what they say and cannot be added to each new historical jesus therefore has to be got out of them by suppression at one point and exaggeration at another _meta_end_dot_

 in the second place all such constructions place the importance of their historical jesus in some peculiar theory he is supposed to have promulgated _meta_end_dot_

 he has to be a great man in the modern sense of the word one standing at the terminus of some centrifugal and unbalanced line of thought a crank vending a panacea _meta_end_dot_

 we thus distract men s minds from who he is and what he did _meta_end_dot_

 we first make him solely a teacher and then conceal the very substantial agreement between his teachings and those of all other great moral teachers _meta_end_dot_

 for humans must not be allowed to notice that all great moralists are sent by the enemy not to inform men but to remind them to restate the primeval moral platitudes against our continual concealment of them _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 the historical jesus then however dangerous he may seem to be to us at some particular point is always to be encouraged _meta_end_dot_

 about the general connection between christianity and politics our position is more delicate _meta_end_dot_

 certainly we do not want men to allow their christianity to flow over into their political life for the establishment of anything like a really just society would be a major disaster _meta_end_dot_

 on the other hand we do want and want very much to make men treat christianity as a means preferably of course as a means to their own advancement but failing that as a means to anything even to social justice _meta_end_dot_

 the thing to do is to get a man at first to value social justice as a thing which the enemy demands and then work him on to the stage at which he values christianity because it may produce social justice _meta_end_dot_

 for the enemy will not be used as a convenience _meta_end_dot_

 men or nations who think they can revive the faith in order to make a good society might just as well think they can use the stairs of heaven as a short cut to the nearest chemist s shop _meta_end_dot_

 fortunately it is quite easy to coax humans round this little corner _meta_end_dot_

 only today i have found a passage in a christian writer where he recommends his own version of christianity on the ground that only such a faith can outlast the death of old cultures and the birth of new civilisations _meta_end_dot_

 you see the little rift _meta_end_question_

 believe this not because it is true but for some other reason that s the game chapter _meta_number_ref_ c _meta_end_dot_
