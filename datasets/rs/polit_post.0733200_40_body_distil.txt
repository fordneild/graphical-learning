  couple final points i wanted to make sure to mention _meta_end_dot_

 rudy v _meta_end_dot_

 mccain style difference sen _meta_end_dot_

 mccain has emphatically clung to the idea that a campaign should be about policy differences between the candidates _meta_end_dot_

 his criticisms of sen _meta_end_dot_

 clinton focus on her disastrous iraq policy her health care plan and other policy differences _meta_end_dot_

 mayor giuliani has a much more abrasive and combative view of politics much closer to the clinton model _meta_end_dot_

 mr _meta_end_dot_

 and mrs _meta_end_dot_

 clinton both see almost no difference between politics and personal life _meta_end_dot_

 hillary s vast right wing conspiracy comment is one of many examples of this all of life is politics principle _meta_end_dot_

 rudy and hillary would likely have another campaign full of negative ads partisanship and a willingness to fight this obviously appeals to partisans on both sides _meta_end_dot_

 mccain goes out of his way to appeal to the independents who despise that part of politics _meta_end_dot_

 his enduring appeal to independents which is greater than the more moderate rudy is based on his style which focuses on respect for those who he disagrees with and a desire to get things done rather than to create a permanent partisan majority _meta_end_dot_

 in a general election mccain s inclusiveness and anti partisanship will be in stark contrast to hillary s very partisan persona and thought process _meta_end_dot_

 most political junkies vote on policy but this difference in style will matter in a general election _meta_end_dot_

 overall experience this was a phenomenal opportunity to see real live retail politics in the most important election in the world for the president of the united states of america _meta_end_dot_

 i have realized how difficult it is to capture what the campaign trail is like for those of you who like me have never been on it _meta_end_dot_

 if you want to get another perspective on what life on the campaign trail is like drop by the mccain blogettes run by the senator s daughter meghan and her friends _meta_end_dot_

 they are very nice young women and their photos and experiences on the road are good depictions of the high paced campaign life _meta_end_dot_

 thanks this ride along would not have happened if it wasn t for the logistical help of pat hynes and brooke buchanan on the mccain campaign _meta_end_dot_

 i also received the very valuable advice of other citizen journalists including from our very own ben and soren on what to expect and what to bring with me _meta_end_dot_

 furthermore the mccain blogettes were generous with their time and thoughts and i enjoyed talking to them about their experiences _meta_end_dot_

 finally the campaign treated me as any other journalist and that respect can mean a lot to newbie _meta_end_dot_
