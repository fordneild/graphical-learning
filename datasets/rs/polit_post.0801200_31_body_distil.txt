  this one might come from house majority whip james clyburn who just happens to be from the upcoming primary state of south carolina _meta_end_dot_

 rep _meta_end_dot_

 clyburn is angry at some of the comments that have come out of the clinton campaign comments that appear to have racial undertones _meta_end_dot_

 i don t think anyone meant anything by those comments and i am not going to ascribe evil motives but it is obvious that this campaign is getting very intense and with that intensity comes a propensity to make ill considered comments _meta_end_dot_

 bill clinton has famously good relations with the african american community _meta_end_dot_

 i imagine that he is going to work to use those relations to try to soothe any hurt feelings _meta_end_dot_

 he had better _meta_end_dot_

 if he doesn t clyburn who promised to remain on the fence could come out for obama and could cause lots of african americans torn between their fondness for the clintons and for obama as the first major african american candidate for the presidency to put aside their doubts and worries and to follow clyburn s example _meta_end_dot_
