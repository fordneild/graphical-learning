  update the democrats in question are no votes ackerman clarke degette hastings fl lee mcdermott scott va stark and woolsey _meta_end_dot_

 present votes conyers frank ma holt payne schakowsky schwartz wasserman schultz welch vt and yarmuth lee voted no on christmas and missed the ramadan vote what would you say if i told you that eighteen democrat representatives elected members of the united states congress either voted against or simply voted present on a resolution passed in honor of christmas _meta_end_question_

 then what would you say if i told you that seventeen of these eighteen american representatives also voted for a resolution passed in honor of ramadan _meta_end_question_

 no joke and believe me it gets better _meta_end_dot_

 go below the fold for more _meta_end_dot_

 the resolution brought to the floor in honor of christmas h r _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ warning temporary link said simply the following objectionable _meta_end_question_

 well to seventeen democrat congresspersons it was more objectionable than the following resolution honoring islam here s one thing i have learned very well and very clearly from my time in iraq and elsewhere in the arab islamic world there is one language which is spoken above all others the language of power _meta_end_dot_

 concession and compromise are signs of weakness beyond measure to those who would kill us every time we attempt to show our goodwill and humanity what they see is an invitation to redouble their efforts _meta_end_dot_

 if the rationale behind this vote was to show the islamic world not only that is america willing to keep trying to make nice with it in hopes that the fringe elements will simply vanish but also that as a sign of our goodwill we in the form of these seventeen representatives will symbolically elevate it over the religion that provided america s moral and theological foundation then it is simply a move made out of a complete and utter ignorance of how our enemies view the world _meta_end_dot_

 if it is out of something other than that well that s just pathetic _meta_end_dot_

 merry christmas to you all anyway even if you were one of the eighteen grinches to vote against it
