  a much anticipated report from the labor department s bureau of labor statistics bls shows that employment in the us added _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ new jobs last month _meta_end_dot_

 this was far less than the consensus estimate of private economists surveyed by news organizations _meta_end_dot_

 the markets have been waiting for this report for several weeks as the usual holiday season paucity of news and trading activity gave them little else to focus on _meta_end_dot_

 but the news comes as a slug in the gut _meta_end_dot_

 it touched off an instantaneous rocket propelled rally in the us treasury market _meta_end_dot_

 as i write this _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_am est the _meta_number_ref_ year note is up _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ and its yield is down to _meta_number_ref_ _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 more _meta_end_dot_

 i think the labor department should stop publishing the employment rate which i won t bother quoting to you for two reasons _meta_end_dot_

 first you ll hear it everywhere today anyway and second it s a near meaningless number in economic terms _meta_end_dot_

 what they do publish that is actually interesting is the job performance of various sectors of the economy _meta_end_dot_

 keep in mind throughout this discussion that the december report is a first look and will be revised twice in the next few months _meta_end_dot_

 in recent months the revisions have all been to the upside which may or may not mean anything manufacturing and construction businesses what bls calls goods producing subtracted _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ jobs in december while services businesses added _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 the service sector is by far the largest part of the economy and includes professionals educators the hospitality business and notably governments _meta_end_dot_

 all of these had sharp employment growth _meta_end_dot_

 retail trade got slugged hard but that may be a normal seasonal effect _meta_end_dot_

 the disappointing performance in service sector employment is one of the clearest signs yet that the us economy is slowing rapidly _meta_end_dot_

 now the interpretation you ll hear people place on this is that the end of the mortgage bubble has finally found a way to affect the real economy _meta_end_dot_

 more specifically consumers are reacting to the decline in the values of their homes by spending less _meta_end_dot_

 except that we ve seen no corroborating statistics to indicate that consumer spending is slowing _meta_end_dot_

 rather the opposite seems to be taking place _meta_end_dot_

 to repeat what i ve said any number of times here over the last few months the global credit situation will strongly and negatively affect economic growth _meta_end_dot_

 although there have very recently since new year s been some hopeful signs that life is returning to the market for short term borrowing by corporations commercial paper credit markets as a whole remain in a deep freeze around the world _meta_end_dot_

 i believe that this trend which tends to reduce business investment in the developed countries will result in a strong headwind in the us economy _meta_end_dot_

 those of us who have been saying that for months have been waiting for confirming signs in the economic statistics _meta_end_dot_

 there has been no lack of signals of weak activity in europe which was hit by the credit crisis far worse than we were _meta_end_dot_

 it turns out they were the people who supplied the money for much maybe most of the us mortgage bubble the us has been more resilient _meta_end_dot_

 until this morning _meta_end_dot_
