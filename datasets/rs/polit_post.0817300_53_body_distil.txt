  john mccain criticized barack obama s winks and nods towards protectionists today in a speech _meta_end_dot_

 the substance is notable of course and readers know that trade policy is very interesting indeed as far as i am concerned so the substance alone is enough to grab my attention _meta_end_dot_

 but for this post i want to focus my attention on the obama campaign s response this from yesterday _meta_end_dot_

 remember these words _meta_end_question_

 either way this is a sorry display _meta_end_dot_

 obama veers wildly from giving comfort to protectionists to trying to convince free traders that he really is on their side _meta_end_dot_

 i know that there is pandering in politics but usually the pandering is carried off in a more _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 how to phrase this _meta_end_question_

 _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 professional manner _meta_end_dot_

 then again maybe this isn t pandering _meta_end_dot_

 maybe obama and his campaign genuinely don t have a clue as to what their policy is or is going to be when it comes to free trade _meta_end_dot_

 and if so that s even scarier than finding that they are pandering _meta_end_dot_
