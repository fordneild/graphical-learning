  fivethirtyeight com has some numbers up of how the blue dogs jumped on fisa _meta_end_dot_

 as they note the final vote was _meta_number_ref_ yea to _meta_number_ref_ nay on the democratic side which in itself is instructive of the failure of the progressive netroots to impose their desires on their party but among competitive seat democrats _meta_number_ref_ as per the cook political report the ratio was _meta_number_ref_ yea to _meta_number_ref_ nay _meta_end_dot_

 a fairly significant difference and one that suggests that the democrats have a fairly significant disconnect between rhetoric and reality _meta_end_dot_

 but we ll discuss that below _meta_end_dot_

 by the way those _meta_number_ref_ yea votes were from harry mitchell az _meta_number_ref_ gabrielle giffords az _meta_number_ref_ jerry mcnerney ca _meta_number_ref_ tim mahoney fl _meta_number_ref_ john barrow ga _meta_number_ref_ jim marshall ga _meta_number_ref_ melissa bean il _meta_number_ref_ brad ellsworth in _meta_number_ref_ nancy hoyda ks _meta_number_ref_ dennis moore ks _meta_number_ref_ john yarmuth ky _meta_number_ref_ don cazayoux la _meta_number_ref_ travis childers ms _meta_number_ref_ kirsten gillibrand ny _meta_number_ref_ michael arcuri ny _meta_number_ref_ zack space oh _meta_number_ref_ chris carney pa _meta_number_ref_ paul kanjorski pa _meta_number_ref_ jason altmire pa _meta_number_ref_ joe sestak pa _meta_number_ref_ patrick murphy pa _meta_number_ref_ nick lampson tx _meta_number_ref_ and ciro rodriguez tx _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 i mention this because i am given to understand that actblue is making it a point to target these individuals as well as house majority leader steny hoyer and far be it from me to stand in their way _meta_end_dot_

 go ahead and spend that money netrooters _meta_end_dot_

 the rest of you read on _meta_end_dot_

 back in _meta_number_ref_ our own soren dayton responded to a somewhat aggravated matt stoller s declaration that the _meta_number_ref_ election cycle had not actually eliminated the conservative majority in congress _meta_end_dot_

 stoller had called it the working conservative but not republican majority requiring dayton s correction that what was actually taking place was a pro security majority _meta_end_dot_

 a conservative majority would actually be doing something about spending after all _meta_end_dot_

 yes this is our favorite complaint and will probably remain so until roughly five minutes before the sun goes nova so you might as well get used to it _meta_end_dot_

 but even a politician eager to waste your money can still be opposed to putting american civilians at actual risk of getting killed and they ll vote accordingly _meta_end_dot_

 so examining the fisa vote in the light of this observation explains a good deal actually _meta_end_dot_

 it should be noted that the gop plus the blue dogs if we use the above definition was not actually enough by themselves to pass the fisa bill we had _meta_number_ref__meta_beep_ref_ of the gop vote present and _meta_number_ref_ vote against it which would have given a total of _meta_number_ref_ votes not enough to pass if democrats from more reliable seats hadn t also voted yea _meta_end_dot_

 the nay votes were in fact mostly from the congressional black caucus _meta_percent_ref_ nay and the congressional progressive caucus something like _meta_percent_ref_ nay while the two factions are quite powerful they apparently have merely a plurality even in their own party_meta_beep_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 this explains speaker pelosi s own decision to support the bill it might startle you to know that she is not a member of the cpc in fact i have been informed that her performance as ranking member of the house permanent select committee on intelligence wasn t actually bad which embarrassingly startled me but it doesn t really explains senator obama s _meta_end_dot_

 and make no mistake whatever he says about trying to strip out the language regarding telecom immunity he won t be doing a blessed thing to stop it _meta_end_dot_

 senate majority leader reid has his marching orders from senate minority leader mitch mcconnell and given that this bill is slightly less odious to the progressives than the one that passed the senate _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ please note that obama s opposition then did not extend to actually voting on it which is a bit of a theme for both him and his supporters it s going to pass and probably fairly quickly _meta_end_dot_

 that s because there s a pro security majority in the senate too thanks to senator lieberman mcconnell can win a floor vote on national security issues if he needs to badly enough and reid knows it full well _meta_end_dot_

 this often gets obscured by the _meta_number_ref_ votes for cloture maneuver which survives primarily because both parties find it too useful to destroy but that majority s there _meta_end_dot_

 fighting that majority is thus not really on the list of things to be done by the junior senator from illinois _meta_end_dot_

 first he d lose second there s no need for a second losing is quite bad enough from his point of view _meta_end_dot_

 hence this attempt at a balancing act it s an open question whether it ll work although i have my cheerful doubts _meta_end_dot_

 it s also an open question whether obama wants to distance himself from progressives or whether he just wants to appear to distance himself _meta_end_dot_

 up to a couple of days ago i would have said the latter but the sheer cynicism of his abandonment of campaign finance reform at least suggests that he might not really believe in anything _meta_end_dot_

 i suppose that it doesn t really matter either way _meta_end_dot_

 not to me not to senator obama and certainly not to the progressives themselves given that they have precisely zero alternatives now _meta_end_dot_

 moe lane being defined as toss up _meta_number_ref_ leans democrat _meta_number_ref_ and likely democrat _meta_number_ref_ minus _meta_number_ref_ retirees _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_beep_ref_most of the antiwar republicans the cowards _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_beep_ref_this is in marked contrast to the pro security faction in the gop which is so powerful that people forget that it is a faction at all _meta_end_dot_

 in fact it is so powerful that failure to adhere to its central tenets is considered proof that one is a fringe republican congressman which habitually irritates those so tagged mostly to the rest of the party s profound indifference _meta_end_dot_
