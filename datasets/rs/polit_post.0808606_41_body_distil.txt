  as the unpledged party leader and elected official delegates to the democratic national convention weigh their solemn duty to decide who will be the _meta_number_ref_ democratic presidential nominee arguably their chief job is to choose the candidate who is best equipped to win _meta_end_dot_

 no democrat who has to run on the ballot most pleos are elected officials has a need to see another george mcgovern _meta_end_dot_

 so following is the kind of math the delegates are most likely looking at as the democratic nomination process wears on read on _meta_end_dot_

 here is a table of the ten closest states in the _meta_number_ref_ presidential election their winners in the _meta_number_ref_ democratic process and the electoral votes carried by the states _meta_end_dot_

 quite a mixed bag of results _meta_end_dot_

 poor superdelegates _meta_end_dot_

 there are more ways to grapple with this list than hands to weigh them in i believe any smart superdelegate has to ignore the emotional appeals of the supporters of each candidate _meta_end_dot_

 the democratic party for better or for worse has chosen to use a nomination process less responsive to the popular will than even the us does in the general election between the randomness of the proportional district results in which winning some districts by a point wins you more delegates and winning others by a point will not and the large number of superdelegates themselves who are guaranteed to have the power to choose the winner in any close race such as this one due to the mathematics of requiring a majority on the floor _meta_end_dot_

 the system is what it is and if one believes the party is the only hope for america the party has to win _meta_end_dot_

 do delegates or popular votes in the primaries matter or do electoral votes for november matter _meta_end_question_

 i think the answer is clear and that is why the superdelegates yet refuse to swing the election for barack obama _meta_end_dot_

 they want clinton and no amount of netroots whining will change that _meta_end_dot_
