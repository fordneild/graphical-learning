  everyone lets please ignore mark mazzetti s reporting a new assessment by american intelligence agencies concludes that iran halted its nuclear weapons program in _meta_number_ref_ and that the program remains on hold contradicting an assessment two years ago that tehran was working inexorably toward building a bomb _meta_end_dot_

 the assessment a national intelligence estimate that represents the consensus view of all _meta_number_ref_ american spy agencies states that tehran s ultimate intentions about gaining a nuclear weapon remain unclear but that iran s decisions are guided by a cost benefit approach rather than a rush to a weapon irrespective of the political economic and military costs the new report concludes that if iran were to end the freeze of its weapons program it would still be at least two years before tehran would have enough highly enriched uranium to produce a nuclear bomb _meta_end_dot_

 but it says it is still very unlikely iran could produce enough of the material by then _meta_end_dot_

 the only appropriate response to this is to do what we ve done already with iaea information on iran with iaea information on iraq and with intelligence and research bureau information on iran ignore it _meta_end_dot_

 note after all that this assessment of the iranian political system is in line with what the overwhelming majority of experts on iran think so we should do what we ve been doing with regional experts for the past six years ignore them _meta_end_dot_

 islamofascism is on the march _meta_end_dot_

 deniers and appears must be ignored _meta_end_dot_

 i for one am confident that we can pull operation ignore off with sufficient hope not only from the bush administration but also from the washington post editorial page which i trust can treat us to more sermons on how the people generating the alarmism are the ones really trying to stave off war _meta_end_dot_
