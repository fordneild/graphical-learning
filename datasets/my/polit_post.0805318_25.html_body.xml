  what ezra klein said about this kos diary which reaches some unfair to clinton conclusions based on a comparison of the clinton obama records in the senate _meta_end_dot_

 i would further note that looking at what legislation a senator has or hasn t cosponsored can get pretty misleading _meta_end_dot_

 cosponsoring a piece of legislation that s not going anywhere is the ultimate in congressional cheap talk _meta_end_dot_

 what s more senators sometimes sign on to legislation they don t actually favor see the republican co sponsors of ron wyden s bill in order to be able to change things around _meta_end_dot_

 and sometimes taking a position in favor of something actually means the reverse i recall a noteworthy moment at yearlykos last summer where clinton was trying to brush off worries about her commitment to political reform by noting that she s on record in favor of full public financing of federal campaigns _meta_end_dot_

 well i favor that too but it s not going to happen and clinton s never done anything to try to lay the groundwork for making it happen _meta_end_dot_

 in effect her support for public financing is a beard to give cover to her opposition to smaller scale more realistic political reform proposals _meta_end_dot_

 which isn t to say that she s uniquely duplicitous in these regards i just happen to be familiar with that particular issue _meta_end_dot_

 you see something similar with john dingell and the carbon tax and indeed with tons and tons of other legislators _meta_end_dot_

 if you want to understand people s records you have two decent options _meta_end_dot_

 one is to go totally dumb and use something like dw nominate which soaks up every single vote cast _meta_end_dot_

 there the size of the data set helps iron out the flaws in the individual data points and gives you a crude big picture sense of where things stand both are liberal and obama somewhat more so _meta_end_dot_

 the other way to go is to go smart in which case you need to actually speak to people who work with congress on some issue you re concerned with and ask them how helpful or not some senator or other has been on some issue _meta_end_dot_

 that ll involve voting records cosponsored legislation media appearances floor statements timing committee antics secret promises friends of friends etc _meta_end_dot_

 going for the middle ground seems appealing but the odds are that it s just going to wind up misleading _meta_end_dot_
