  approximately zero percent of the population seems to understand what at t is trying to say with its bizarre ad campaign about how i need a phone that works where i live a place called bizarreportmanteauplacename probably because the ads are really dumb _meta_end_dot_

 what they mean for the record is that at t s phones operate on the gsm standard which is much more widely used outside the us _meta_end_dot_

 thus an at t phone will for an appropriate fee work pretty much wherever you want to go _meta_end_dot_

 a verizon phone by contrast will not _meta_end_dot_

 given that most americans don t do much international travel this probably isn t a compelling consideration for all that many people but if you do go abroad regularly it s a big difference _meta_end_dot_
