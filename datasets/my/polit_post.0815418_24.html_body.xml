  it s the matchup the hater in me was dreading _meta_end_dot_

 already the hiatus is filling with stuff about the top ten moments in lakers celtics history and hearing how meaning no disrespect to _meta_number_ref_ other teams thanks for getting out of the way but the good news is that we have a scenario where i think it s pretty clear that l a _meta_end_dot_

 is the superior team but they re not wildly superior and boston has home court since the lakers played much of the season without their current roster _meta_end_dot_

 consequently i think the outcome s genuinely in doubt _meta_end_dot_

 i d give the edge to l a _meta_end_dot_

 but i m surprised to see nine out of ten espn com people agreeing with that since my level of confidence in that pick is pretty low _meta_end_dot_
