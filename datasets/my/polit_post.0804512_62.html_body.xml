  this finding from gallup provides an interesting look at the enthusiasm gap between the parties _meta_end_dot_

 even with the clinton obama race reaching a new level of heatedness in blog comment threads and email lists everywhere it remains the case that each contender is seen as an unusually high quality candidate over sixty percent of democrats _meta_end_dot_

 by contrast fewer than ten percent of democrats see either contender as unusually weak _meta_end_dot_

 consequently you mostly have a primary in which two well liked candidates are trying to secure the support of voters who like them both _meta_end_dot_

 and even though i ve got a clear preference in the race i d very much put myself in the category of people who s happy with both his options _meta_end_dot_

 especially in domestic policy terms the clinton _meta_number_ref_ agenda is far far better than kerry _meta_number_ref_ gore _meta_number_ref_ or clinton _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 in large part of course that reflects not the intrinsic attributes of clinton and obama but the changing nature of our times and the leftward gravitational pull exercised by the edwards campaign but it s still the field we ve got and it s a very strong one _meta_end_dot_
