  pithlord requested a substantive post about afghanistan the other day and i think he s right to call for one _meta_end_dot_

 the main contribution to the debate that i think needs to be made is that beyond concrete matters about weapons money etc _meta_end_dot_

 the united states badly needs to undertake some gesture of commitment and investment to the mission in afghanistan _meta_end_dot_

 we need our nato allies to do more in afghanistan _meta_end_dot_

 my sense is that a lot of nato government officials are sympathetic to that message _meta_end_dot_

 but as i saw when i was across the atlantic european and i believe canadian politicians feel enormous from their publics to do less _meta_end_dot_

 in this context it s an incredible problem for politicians who d like to be helpful to us that they can t very credibly point to afghanistan and say hey _meta_end_exclamation_

 look _meta_end_exclamation_

 this is a huge priority for the united states _meta_end_exclamation_

 it s really important to our bilateral relationship to show that we re valuable allies after all not only is iraq getting the lions share of american troops and money it s taking up a wildly disproportionate share of the mindspace _meta_end_dot_

 our commanding general in iraq is a huge celebrity relentlessly touted by leading politicians _meta_end_dot_

 nobody can even name his counterpart in afghanistan _meta_end_dot_

 and meanwhile the president openly brags about how he likes to take the advice of his theater commander over the advice of all his superiors as to how us forces should be deployed _meta_end_dot_

 it all gives the impression of a country that cares a great deal about iraq and thinks of afghanistan as a backwater _meta_end_dot_

 well no european country is going to roll up its sleeves and pitch in in iraq _meta_end_dot_

 and insofar as we don t seem to care about afghanistan it s difficult for them to care more than us _meta_end_dot_

 after all it was the united states that got attacked from afghanistan and it was from afghanistan that the united states got attacked _meta_end_dot_

 i can t speak at all to logistics details how many brigades would it be useful or feasible to switch from one theater to the next _meta_end_dot_

 but in broad political terms i think it s crucial that the next president put down some very real markers of commitment and even important that people running for president now indicate that this will be their policy _meta_end_dot_
