  i really like gadgets in general and apple stuff in particular so i fully intend to buy one of the new iphones when doing so becomes convenient _meta_end_dot_

 but i don t really understand the psychology of camping out to get in line to get one on the very first morning i was very pleased to spend last night in my regular bed _meta_end_dot_

 but megan mcardle and peter suderman don t see things that way and they have some extensive coverage of the scene at the clarendon apple store if you re curious _meta_end_dot_

 i mostly continue to find it a disgrace that our nation s capital lacks an apple store of its own _meta_end_dot_
