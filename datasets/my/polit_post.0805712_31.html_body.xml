  molly young has a worthwhile essay on n _meta_number_ref_ s website about her use of adderral as a performance enhancing study drug in college _meta_end_dot_

 it s something i tried a few times both as she describes and as a recreational drug back in the day but i found its effects to be pretty mild _meta_end_dot_

 the big plus side is that if i tried to pull all nighters based on drinking coffee or diet coke i would eventually get shaky and feel a bit ill whereas on adderral i could really keep plugging along _meta_end_dot_

 it s not however something i really ever had great occasion to use _meta_end_dot_

 some people though clearly experience great effects and it does raise some questions _meta_end_dot_

 do we really want to create a situation where some students may feel that they have to abuse prescription drugs to stay competitive in school _meta_end_question_

 then again if there s a pill out there that s safe to take and helps kids learn a bunch of stuff doesn t it seem like we should be prescribing more of it _meta_end_question_

 i d want to know more about what the real medical affects of taking the stuff before i made any kind of judgment _meta_end_dot_

 i will say that i was a bit shocked to hear about some of the younger faculty using it to help get their work done but even though at the moment adderral seems to mainly be a vice of college students there s no particular reason it couldn t be useful in good ways or bad for a much wider range of people _meta_end_dot_
