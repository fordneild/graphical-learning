  paul krugman writes that you can t think correctly about climate change unless you take adequate consideration of relatively unlikely scenarios for disaster _meta_end_dot_

 psychologically if there s only a one or two percent change of something happening we tend to put it in the not going to happen file _meta_end_dot_

 but sound policymaking would consider a one percent chance of a scenario in which billions die to be something worth worrying about _meta_end_dot_

 i ve been thinking about this lately as i re read watchmen inspired by the trailer for the forthcoming film adaptation _meta_end_dot_

 it s a reminder that in the _meta_number_ref_s and especially before the reykjavik summit there was enormous anxiety about nuclear war _meta_end_dot_

 in particular the criticism that ronald reagan s policies were likely to lead to a nuclear war was though clearly not embraced by a majority a fairly widespread and mainstream opinion _meta_end_dot_

 this comes out in watchmen and the dark knight returns and _meta_number_ref_ red balloons among other places obviously in retrospect this was wrong _meta_end_dot_

 consequently from a certain point of view the nuclear freeze movement people and critics of reagan s evil empire rhetoric look foolish _meta_end_dot_

 but when you think in terms of probabilities this isn t necessarily right _meta_end_dot_

 say that under jimmy carter s policies there would have been a one percent chance of a nuclear war in the _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ period whereas under reagan s more aggressive policies there was a three percent chance of such a war _meta_end_dot_

 that still gives a very good chance that reaganism will work out _meta_number_ref_ percent is good odds but still probably means that the reagan option is a bad idea _meta_end_dot_

 but then of course things will probably turn out okay making the skeptics look foolish and perhaps unduly biasing future policymaking toward aggressive options _meta_end_dot_
