  adam thierer s making some other point in this post but his chart comparing the market capitalization of new to old media firms is fascinating _meta_end_dot_

 did you know for example that at _meta_dollor_ref_ billion the market capitalization of google is about seven times that of the entire american newspaper sector _meta_dollor_ref_ billion _meta_end_question_

 now admittedly in part that just shows that the newspaper sector is small _meta_end_dot_

 but it also certainly reminds me of the circumstances that prevailed before the aol time warner merger speaking of which time warner s market cap is a bit below _meta_dollor_ref_ billion _meta_end_dot_

 maybe google s just hugely overvalued _meta_end_dot_

 or maybe not _meta_end_dot_

 maybe this points the way to the future of news operations _meta_end_dot_

 maybe after another decades of attrition pure aggregation functions like google news won t work so well since there s so little actual news being written _meta_end_dot_

 maybe the continued decline of newspapers will start to be a drag on the blogosphere _meta_end_dot_

 maybe a newspaper chain gets picked up for a song as a kind of loss leader for google news google reader and blogger _meta_end_dot_

 or maybe i just don t know what i m talking about why after all would you take business advice from me _meta_end_question_
