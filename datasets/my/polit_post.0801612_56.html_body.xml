  can it it really be true that gerald ford ronald reagan george h w _meta_end_dot_

 bush and bill clinton are all left handed _meta_end_dot_

 four out of the last six presidents _meta_end_question_

 with lefties representing such a tiny proportion of the overall population _meta_end_dot_

 is there some kind of crazy conspiracy out there _meta_end_question_

 of course i suppose george w _meta_end_dot_

 bush isn t making a very strong case for right handed leadership _meta_end_dot_
