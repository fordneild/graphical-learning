  ooops _meta_end_dot_

 in an earlier post i criticized congressional legislation to ban incandescent lightbulbs and mandate the use of compact fluorescent lights _meta_end_dot_

 there is no such legislation _meta_end_dot_

 instead there s legislation that mandates bulbs meet energy efficiency standards that only cfls and impractically expensive leds can meet _meta_end_dot_

 i apologize for the error _meta_end_dot_

 that said the point still stands _meta_end_dot_

 the sort of plans to curb carbon emissions that the democratic presidential candidates are both necessary and sufficient to meet the challenges of global warming _meta_end_dot_

 these plans place an economy wide cap on carbon emissions auction permits to produce the allowed level of emissions let emitters buy and sell permits on the open market and will then rely on the price system to help individual consumers adjust their personal habits to the new low emissions regime as they see fit _meta_end_dot_

 domain specific efficiency standards like this cfl business are by contrast neither necessary nor sufficient _meta_end_dot_

 i m not going to take to the streets to protest against incandescent bulb bans or increased cafe standards but i do think the legislative battles over this stuff are fundamentally a waste of time _meta_end_dot_
