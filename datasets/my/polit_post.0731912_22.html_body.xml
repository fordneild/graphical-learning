  david broder is a prominent newspaper columnist _meta_end_dot_

 he also obviously doesn t care for bill clinton _meta_end_dot_

 and that s what s going to happen now and again prominent columnist dislikes prominent politician _meta_end_dot_

 but for some reason instead of broder saying that he broder has some kind of problem with clinton followed by an explanation of the nature of his beef an argument about bill clinton warns us darkly that the former president s intervention on the campaign trail in south carolina raises the prospect of a dual presidency which will test the tolerance of the american people far more severely than the possibility of the first female president or for that matter the first black president broder doesn t go on to try to present any research or data to back up that claim _meta_end_dot_

 and why should he _meta_end_question_

 after all in this context the american people doesn t refer to the people who live in america rather it means david broder or possibly broder plus some of his friends who acting in their capacity as the great and the good eschew the first person plural or singular and write instead in the voice of the american people but the real american people like bill clinton liked him throughout the impeachment farce liked him throughout the alleged clinton fatigue era like him today would have elected him to a third term etc etc _meta_end_dot_

 etc _meta_end_dot_
