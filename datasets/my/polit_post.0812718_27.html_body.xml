  word is that the wizards are planning to resign gilbert arenas and antawn jamison _meta_end_dot_

 that all simply raises the question resign them for how much money _meta_end_question_

 jamison is unquestionably a good player and agent zero was a good player when he was healthy and presumably will be again they re guys that all else being equal it s good to have on your team but all else is rarely equal _meta_end_dot_

 gilbert in particular keeps talking as if he expects a max deal and i think that d be crazy _meta_end_dot_

 the maximum salary rule is a great opportunity that allows a select number of lucky teams to underpay elite players guys like chris paul and lebron james are never going to be able to do what shaq and kevin garnett did and get paid their real market value _meta_end_dot_

 you don t want to blow that kind of opportunity on lesser players unless you ve got good reason to _meta_end_dot_

 this year jamison s earning _meta_dollor_ref_ million and arenas is earning _meta_dollor_ref_ million and i seriously doubt there s another team in the league that s in a position to offer either of them more than that _meta_end_dot_

 and yet sometimes you see a franchise do what orlando did with rashard lewis last year and overbid the market for no real reason _meta_end_dot_
