  i agree with this entirely _meta_end_dot_

 yes it s true that most eleven year olds probably aren t knowledgeable enough to make a well informed choice about political candidates but the evidence overwhelmingly indicates that most fifty year olds aren t very well informed either _meta_end_dot_

 and yet everyone gets to vote and of course many people choose not to _meta_end_dot_

 everyone that is except for that would be eleven year old voter _meta_end_dot_
