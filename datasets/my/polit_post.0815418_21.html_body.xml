  karl rove is facing contempt citations for his refusal to answer subpoenas to testify before congress _meta_end_dot_

 but lucky for him he s gotten himself a friendly judge in bush appointee john bates a former deputy independent counsel in ken starr s whitewater investigation bates is the same judge who threw out a government accountability office complaint against vice president dick cheney in december _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 back then the gao s comptroller general david walker was seeking access to internal documents from cheney s secretive energy task force using arguments similar to those the judiciary committee is making today namely that the white house s refusal to provide information to congressional investigators is damaging congress oversight mandate _meta_end_dot_

 note of course that a background working for ken starr clearly does not in this case signify a strong belief in vigorous oversight of the executive branch _meta_end_dot_

 rather as bates previous rulings make clear he s a believer in vigorous oversight of democratic party presidents while republicans can do whatever they want _meta_end_dot_

 bush clearly chose well when deciding to make this guy a judge _meta_end_dot_
