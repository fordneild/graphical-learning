  ilan goldenberg goes beyond the observation that for conservatives it s always _meta_number_ref_ and notes the opposite lessons of world war i where various sides deemed themselves forced to fight a war nobody wanted and that served nobody s interests _meta_end_dot_

 my strong sense is that _meta_number_ref_ scenarios are more common than _meta_number_ref_ scenarios _meta_end_dot_

 trade and tourism are positive sum interactions between nations _meta_end_dot_

 war and coercive acts short of war are negative sum interactions _meta_end_dot_

 this means you should try very hard to seek peaceful intercourse via trade and tourism and to avoid negative sum conflict based interactions _meta_end_dot_

 sometimes of course one faces a foe so determinedly fanatical that it s impossible to avoid the negative sum track where everyone invests vast resources in figuring out better ways to blow stuff up _meta_end_dot_

 but the kind of strong irrationality represented by a hitler or perhaps a pol pot is very rare normally people can t acquire and maintain political power without being sensitive to their own interests _meta_end_dot_
