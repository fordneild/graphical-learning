  a lot of separate questions about how to improve transit in this country come down to the same solution decide we want to improve mass transit services _meta_end_dot_

 until then you get things like the state of maryland s transportation planning over the next five years _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ billion for the intercounty connector _meta_dollor_ref_ million for the purple line _meta_dollor_ref_ million for the silver spring transit center _meta_dollor_ref_ million to build the montrose parkway _meta_dollor_ref_ million for the corridor cities transitway _meta_dollor_ref_ million to improve marc tracks _meta_dollor_ref_ million to study extending the green line north to bwi airpoirt the intercountry connector a large highway accounts for an order of magnitude more spending than do all the mass transit projects i e everything else except the montrose parkway on that list _meta_end_dot_

 meanwhile the purple line has to be light rail rather than a faster higher capacity system because heavy rail is too expensive but if maryland politicians are really concerned about the current gas price situation they d drop the icc and use the savings to fund the purple line for the medium term and to improve their bus service for the short term _meta_end_dot_

 good transit projects are expensive but highways are expensive too we live in a rich country and can afford to build the things we decide it s important to build _meta_end_dot_
