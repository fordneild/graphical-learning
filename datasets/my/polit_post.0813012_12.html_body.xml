  after tuesday s results i kind of expected a wednesday superdelegate flood to barack obama _meta_end_dot_

 it didn t really materialize though he did pick up some ground _meta_end_dot_

 and thursday was the same way _meta_end_dot_

 and now looking at my inbox it seems like more of the same as rep _meta_end_dot_

 peter defazio endorses obama while rep _meta_end_dot_

 donald payne switches from clinton to obama _meta_end_dot_

 stuff on this scale doesn t and can t lead to a knockout blow it s more of a death by a thousand cuts thing with the handful of superdelegate defections being especially damaging _meta_end_dot_
