  i ve written before about how most developing countries have even more screwed up energy policies than we do with the government expending large sums of money on environmentally destructive gasoline subsidies that are almost always regressive in the context of a poor country _meta_end_dot_

 one consequence of this that i hadn t considered but which makes sense as soon as you think about it is that if you live in the american southwest you can head south of the border and fill up on cheap gas and while here he would pick up six packs of tecate beer and produce like passion fruit and even visit an orthodontist _meta_end_dot_

 in all he expected to save _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 the border he said flashing a mouthful of braces is our advantage things like buying passion fruit and an affordable orthodontist are conventional gains from trade and ought to be encouraged but the kind of subsidy arbitrage represented by the gas issue isn t all that awesome _meta_end_dot_

 the good news i suppose is that this may put pressure on mexico to start phasing these subsidies out _meta_end_dot_
