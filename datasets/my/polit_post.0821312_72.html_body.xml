  if i may return to the question of john mccain s _meta_dollor_ref_ salvatore ferragamo pregiato moccasins imported from italy i want to say that i think the fact that mccain is an extremely wealthy man is more legitimately relevant to the campaign than a lot of liberals seem willing to credit _meta_end_dot_

 if it turned out that back in his state senate days barack obama passed some laws that massively increased the value of a parcel of land he owned people would report on that story _meta_end_dot_

 or if john mccain was a major stockholder in a defense contracting firm and used his clout on the armed services committee to steer contracts in their direction people would consider that a relevant factor _meta_end_dot_

 and if a governor somewhere were dipping into the state treasury and transferring the money into personal accounts people would care _meta_end_dot_

 so when you look at something like the distributive impact of barack obama s tax plans versus the distributive impact of john mccain s tax plans it doesn t strike me as ludicrous to say that people ought to spend some time pondering the fact that mccain is a member of the small minority of people who would have higher after tax income under his plan than under obama s on the merits of course bad policy is bad policy irrespective of who proposes it _meta_end_dot_

 repealing the estate tax would be a bad idea even if john mccain had no kids and even if the mccain family didn t own eleven houses _meta_end_dot_

 but still self dealing holds a special role in conventional political discussions and it s not for nothing that mccain makes a big deal out of the ideas of honor and sacrifice as campaign themes _meta_end_dot_
