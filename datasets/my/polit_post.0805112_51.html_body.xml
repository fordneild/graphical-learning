  just got off a conference call with susan rice talking about the contrasts between her boy barack obama and john mccain on national security policy _meta_end_dot_

 one key point of emphasis was the strange notion coming from the mccain campaign that talking about focused counterterrorism operations in afghanistan and pakistan is irresponsible whereas randomly threatening to start new wars is the height of good sense _meta_end_dot_

 as she put it it s a strange contrast he says that somehow it s naive for a presidential candidate to outline how he would deal with that crucial national security challenge but it s appropriate for him to joke about starting another war a reporter from the washington times challenged her on the bomb bomb bomb bomb iran business saying mccain was joking _meta_end_dot_

 rice responds that if he wants to say that he was joking and that s the kind of joke he thinks is funny that s his perogative i see mccain as basically losing on this round _meta_end_dot_

 it s bizarre of his campaign to be trotting out talking points that didn t work for hillary clinton and already before the obama campaign s official counterspin got underway we have spencer ackerman kicking mccain s ass and indeed joe klein calling mccain soft on al qaeda in the msm _meta_end_dot_

 more broadly on experience there s a three pronged attack _meta_end_dot_

 first obama does have experience with rice citing the fact that he authored crucial legislation to secure the united states from the threat of loose nuclear materials and serves on committees and subcommittees dealing with foreign relations veterans affairs and homeland security _meta_end_dot_

 second this means that obama has actually acquired more traditional washington foreign policy experience than most presidents including ronald reagan bill clinton and jimmy carter carter in fact served on a nuclear sub and i m told this gave him a better understanding of nuclear issues than presidents before or after _meta_end_dot_

 third there s more to life than being a prisoner of dc conventional wisdom mccain like donald rumsfeld and dick cheney may have years of washington experience but they ve all made flawed judgments and as a consequence we re less safe in a crucial point rice observed emphasis added that a mccain administration would be very much a continuation and intensification of the failed bush policy remaining in iraq indefinitely not investing adequately in afghanistan according to rice we need to show that we have learned from our mistakes in iraq and elsewhere and are prepared to cooperate and collaborate on the challenges we face namely al qaeda nuclear proliferation and climate change _meta_end_dot_

 i know steve clemons has expressed some concerns that team obama may have a problematic unwillingness to set priorities in foreign policy but i thought rice was admirably clear here _meta_end_dot_

 the question of cooperation and the question of priorities goes hand in hand _meta_end_dot_

 when you re willing to define what it is you think is really important then the stage has been set for other countries to work with you _meta_end_dot_

 the kind of deterioration in america s ability to cooperate with other countries that we ve seen over the past seven years stems not just from cowboy diplomacy but from bush s grandiosity and lack of focus _meta_end_dot_
