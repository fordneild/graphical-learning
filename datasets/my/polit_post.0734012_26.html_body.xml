  for all the demagoguery and recent panic in democratic circles it turns out according to a new lat bloomberg poll that the basic principles of comprehensive reform are still popular about _meta_percent_ref_ of democrats republicans and independents support a path to citizenship by registering paying a fine getting fingerprinted and learning english among other requirements as marc ambinder points out this is the thing that opponents call amnesty so even if amnesty is unpopular the thing that amnesty denotes is popular _meta_end_dot_

 the public continues however to be hostile to the idea of allowing illegal immigrants to avail themselves of public services _meta_end_dot_

 that underscores the central need to place specific immigration issues in the context of broad immigration policy even if tim russert and wolf blitzer don t like it _meta_end_dot_

 everyone agrees at the end of the day that it s dumb to have a big population of people availing themselves of social services who aren t even allowed to be in the country _meta_end_dot_

 but comprehensive reform featuring a path to citizen is a practical economically viable humane way of accomplishing that and despite a lack of public leadership for the past few months the public still seems to recognize it as such _meta_end_dot_
