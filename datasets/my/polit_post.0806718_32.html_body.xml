  brendan nyhan has a bunch of interesting charts about the democratic race of which this one showing the negative correlation between obama s level of white support and the size of the state s southern baptist population _meta_end_dot_

 if you ignore all the states with really small southern baptist populations and just focus on the south you see a correlation that holds up really well _meta_end_dot_

 basically if you think of the number of southern baptists as a proxy for how southern a given southern state is you see that the more culturally dixie states are the ones where whites are most hostile to obama s message _meta_end_dot_

 they re not however necessarily bad states for obama overall since some like alabama and soon mississippi have african americans as such a large share of the democratic vote that he wins anyway _meta_end_dot_
