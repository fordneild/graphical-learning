  yes indeed if you oppose building a bigger building on the sw corner of _meta_number_ref_th and u right now there s a rinky dink one story development there you re a bad person and desperately need to stop being ridiculous _meta_end_dot_

 one of the great things about washington dc is that our metro system is pretty good _meta_end_dot_

 and part of the very essence of making a pretty good metro system viable over the long run is that in the immediate vicinity of metro stations you re going to want to have big buildings and dense developments _meta_end_dot_

 that s just how it works _meta_end_dot_

 if you don t have dense development near transit you can t have viable transit systems _meta_end_dot_

 it s so incredibly frustrating to see time and again proposals to hear talk about how americans don t want to live in cities or use mass transit or whatever else and then turn around and see tons of examples of situations where people certainly seem to want to build high density structures and are confident that others would rent or buy space in the structures _meta_end_dot_

 obviously not everyone is going to want to live that way but evidently many more people would like to than are currently allowed to _meta_end_dot_
