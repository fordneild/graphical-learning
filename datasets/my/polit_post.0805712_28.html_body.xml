  this sounds like an interesting initiative the multi million dollar iraq recession campaign which launches monday seeks to remind voters in the words of organizers that as economic concerns weigh heavily on the minds of americans opposition to president bush s reckless war in iraq continues to grow _meta_end_dot_

 the massive cost of the war in iraq hurtling toward one trillion dollars has increased demand for a strategy to bring u s _meta_end_dot_

 troops home _meta_end_dot_

 the iraq recession campaign will highlight the majority of americans who want to see leadership on investing in critical priorities at home and establishing real security throughout the world in addition to john and elizabeth edwards those involved in launching the campaign included service employees international union secretary treasurer anna burger moveon executive director eli pariser vetsvote chairman jon soltz usaction executive director jeff blum center for american progress president john podesta and americans united for change president brad woodhouse _meta_end_dot_

 the trouble is that as paul krugman has pointed out a few times the short term impact of the war is to serve as a form of economic stimulus _meta_end_dot_

 perversely it might be good for the economy for the war to take a turn for the worse an uptick in the quantity of vehicles and other military equipment destroyed in iraq could stimulate orders for replacements _meta_end_dot_

 which isn t to say that war is good for the economy _meta_end_dot_

 if we could go back in time and invest the hundreds of billions spent in iraq on something more productive we d be in better economic shape today _meta_end_dot_

 alternatively if we could take the vast sums we re currently spending in iraq and somehow frictionlessly transmute that into some kind of better designed domestic stimulus that would help the economy over the short run _meta_end_dot_

 but in terms of actually available policy options the time machine would be handy though bringing the war to an end though strategically vital and good for america s long term economic outlook doesn t seem to me to be something likely to help the country with our short term economic challenges _meta_end_dot_
