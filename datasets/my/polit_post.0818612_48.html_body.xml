  i ve never been _meta_number_ref_ percent clear on why you re not supposed to speak ill of the dead but suffice it to say that while there were many more vile politicians in the world than the now dead jesse helms they were pretty much all brutal dictators and the like _meta_end_dot_

 for a late _meta_number_ref_th century united states senator helms was just awful a bigot who s incredibly retrograde foreign policy views managed to do a surprising amount of harm for a non president and he s probably responsible for all manner of ills i don t even know about _meta_end_dot_

 good riddance _meta_end_dot_
