  economic troubles spreading around the world in recent months some emerging market investors have preached the idea that fast growing areas like most of asia have decoupled from developed markets meaning the economies of the two groups no longer move in tandem _meta_end_dot_

 the investing adage when the united states sneezes asia catches a cold no longer applies the proponents of decoupling argue _meta_end_dot_

 but a recent slump in emerging markets capped by monday s slide means investor sentiment is changing _meta_end_dot_

 indeed this seems doubly wrong _meta_end_dot_

 the big hope for avoiding a recession or for keeping a recession relatively short and painless is that a pickupin exports tied to the declining dollar will cushion the employment situation even as the building sector collapses _meta_end_dot_

 that however means that a sharp decline in us imports from asia is all but inevitable _meta_end_dot_

 that s what would happen in a recession but it s also what would happen in the most plausible non recession scenario _meta_end_dot_
