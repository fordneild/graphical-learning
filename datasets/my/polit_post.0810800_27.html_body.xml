  i d forgotten that for months now charlie gibson has been asserting that _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ is a solid middle class income blissfully unaware that just _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ percent of u s _meta_end_dot_

 households have an income of _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ or more _meta_end_dot_

 you could be richer than _meta_number_ref_ percent of your fellow citizens but still just folks to gibson _meta_end_dot_

 obviously that s not on a par with being bad at bowling or anything on the out of touch scale but it s still disappointing to learn that even our salt of the earth working class multimillionaire television news personalities aren t utterly infallible _meta_end_dot_
