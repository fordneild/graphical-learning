  everything about this john mccain ad is bizarre from the headless anonymous rock star to the wisps of smoke to the fact that it goes out of its way to mention that mccain s middle name is sidney to the fact that the core of the ad is an anecdote about how mccain learned the importance of ratting out your friends at a tony boarding school _meta_end_dot_

 but let s just focus on mccain s impressive consistency _meta_end_dot_

 his example of baseball greatness is ted williams _meta_end_dot_

 a great player to be sure _meta_end_dot_

 but also the only major star named after teddy roosevelt and a guy with a much more impressive military record than your other major athletes _meta_end_dot_

 basically all mccain cares about is martial glory even when he s ostensibly talking about baseball _meta_end_dot_

 anyways don t candidates who attended fancy prep schools normally try to downplay that sort of thing _meta_end_question_

 everyone in america after all went to school and almost all of them are going to remember that they didn t go to a school with an honor code
