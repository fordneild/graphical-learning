  via ross douthat noah millman and russell arben fox offer their views of what mitt romney ought to say in his big speech about religion _meta_end_dot_

 probably he should stay in keeping with his main campaign themes and just tell republican primary voters that he s willing to say whatever they want him to say about mormonism and explain that he s only had trouble with this issue because it s not clear what people want from him _meta_end_dot_

 for that matter if you could just replay this whole primary campaign it seems to me that romney s big mistake was failing to flip flop on the question of his faith _meta_end_dot_

 back when he was a culturally moderate bay stater religion wasn t especially central to romney s political identity _meta_end_dot_

 and while flip flopping on the issues is generally held in low esteem flip flopping on religion converting in short is usually celebrated as long as people like your new religion _meta_end_dot_

 so why not find jesus _meta_end_question_

 back when he was considering that stem cell bill romney could have consulted with a wide array of religious leaders including say a baptist minister _meta_end_dot_

 and maybe the minister in question is really convincing and romney decides to abandon the faith into which he was born _meta_end_dot_

 religious right types have to be prepared to believe conversion stories and the experience of being born again would be the perfect opportunity to flip flip on an array of issues lending the flops a pseudo plausible veneer of respectability _meta_end_dot_

 and who then would speak of mike huckabee _meta_end_question_
