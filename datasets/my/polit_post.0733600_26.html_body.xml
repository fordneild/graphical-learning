  too much travel to be fully on top of the giuliani shag fund story this weekend but one thing i haven t seen remarked upon is the sheer irresponsibility of it all _meta_end_dot_

 this sort of petty corruption happens in politics though the money sleaze and sex sleaze twofer is impressive but normally one advantage of your hard changing ruthless ambition types is that they have the self restraint necessary to avoid these scandals _meta_end_dot_

 it s not good for your career and it s not good for your party _meta_end_dot_

 serious politicians have their eyes on a bigger prize _meta_end_dot_

 the question is where does this spirit of discipline come from _meta_end_dot_

 for some it s a bona fide character trait that happens to be politically useful _meta_end_dot_

 giuliani s shown plenty of discipline on the trail but this sordid episode reminds us of how far it is from hizzoner s natural state _meta_end_dot_

 when he thought his political career was dead anyway he was happy to pull this kind of stunt despite the death blow something like this could deliver to a law and order politician _meta_end_dot_

 and his career s always been marked by various outbursts tantrums and other episodes of responsibility _meta_end_dot_

 the discipline he s shown up until now in walking the ideological tightrope doesn t come naturally to him _meta_end_dot_

 as gfr says he s less the working class kid made good than someone like the self indulgent troubled well to do dads of gossip girl right down to the bad relationships with his children and constant wheeling and dealing meanwhile one of giuliani s core weakness as a politician he s an insane sadist has always also served as a kind of strength _meta_end_dot_

 the madness compels opponents to point out how deranged he is but sometime s the electorate s in the mood for a man who s inclined to push the boundaries and err on the side of a hard line _meta_end_dot_

 new york in _meta_number_ref_ was certainly such a place and the usa in _meta_number_ref_ might be _meta_end_dot_

 but nobody s ever in the mood for a hypocrite who preaches law and order and social stability while using city funds to chauffeur his mistress and her friends around town _meta_end_dot_
