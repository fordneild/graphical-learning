  this is a graphic treatment of an issue mentioned yesterday the somewhat misleading nature of the miles per gallon statistic _meta_end_dot_

 if you use mpg as your main metric of fuel efficiency then a change from a _meta_number_ref_ mpg vehicle to a _meta_number_ref_ mpg vehicle sounds like a smaller advance than does a switch from a _meta_number_ref_ mpg vehicle to a _meta_number_ref_ mpg vehicle _meta_end_dot_

 but if you assume a constant distance to be driven the former switch reduces fuel consumption more _meta_end_dot_

 now obviously a _meta_number_ref_ mpg reduction is still better than a _meta_number_ref_ mpg reduction all else being equal _meta_end_dot_

 but all else crucially isn t equal _meta_end_dot_

 you get much more bang for your buck by improving performance at the low end _meta_end_dot_
