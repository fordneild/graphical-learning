  tim harford looks at evidence that men get served faster than women in coffee shops and wonders of female customers are being discriminated against _meta_end_dot_

 my guess would be that this is our old friend the double standard rather that specific discrimination on the part of baristas _meta_end_dot_

 basically men in coffee shops are more likely to act visibly impatient and demanding _meta_end_dot_

 and this in part is because aggression is generally seen as a good socially approved trait in a man and a bad frowned upon attribute in a woman _meta_end_dot_
