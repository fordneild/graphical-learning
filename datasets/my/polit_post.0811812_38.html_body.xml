  bill simmons writes sorry for bastardizing leo the late bloomer one of my daughter s favorite bedtime stories and a true classic _meta_end_dot_

 but i couldn t help it _meta_end_dot_

 not only has rajon rondo s belated emergence been the most fascinating subplot of a storybook celtics season but he s just like the character in that book _meta_end_dot_

 like leo rondo never spoke _meta_end_dot_

 like leo s father celts fans spent an inordinate amount of time wondering when rondo would draw in this case play with consistency or write in this case bang home open jumpers _meta_end_dot_

 leo had patient parents who believed in him rondo had veterans such as kevin garnett and ray allen role models who provided the confidence and toughness he desperately needed eventually springing him from his on court shell and altering the course of his career _meta_end_dot_

 we always hear about the value of young teams adding veterans but after watching the effects over the course of an _meta_number_ref_ game season it s probably impossible to exaggerrate the importance of polished professional competitive proven veterans on young guys who don t know what the hell they re doing _meta_end_dot_

 i think this is pretty far off base _meta_end_dot_

 the reality is that rajon rondo played pretty well for a terrible _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ celtics team _meta_end_dot_

 when you added kevin garnett and ray allen to the mix had paul pierce play a full season and rounded out the rotation with some decent veterans the team was much better _meta_end_dot_

 that put rondo in a position where people notice that he plays pretty well _meta_end_dot_

 but relative to last year he s rebounding is a bit worse his free throw shooting is a bit worse and his field goal percentage is better _meta_end_dot_

 none of that would be shocking for a guy of his age but it s especially non shocking when you consider that it s harder to rebound when you re competing with the big ticket and better teammates give him more open looks _meta_end_dot_

 he s a pretty good player and deserves credit for contributing to the team _meta_end_dot_

 but there s no dramatic transformation here _meta_end_dot_
