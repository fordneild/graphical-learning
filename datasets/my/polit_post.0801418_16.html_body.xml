  yesterday andrew was fretting about the turn toward a focus on identity politics in the presidential campaign some cultural identification is inevitable in america and not the worst thing in the world _meta_end_dot_

 what s worrying is when candidates do not just accept this but seek to exploit it directly _meta_end_dot_

 huckabee s appeal to christianists is the most troubling but clinton s on gender grounds is not that much better _meta_end_dot_

 so far obama s campaign has resisted crude racial appeals but this has seemed to unravel a bit in the wake of the clintons rhetorical slips this past week _meta_end_dot_

 less is more on this front _meta_end_dot_

 or we begin to lose the capacity to see ourselves as equal participants in a democracy rather than interest groups fighting for what s and who s ours _meta_end_dot_

 i believe things are different in the uk but it s worth saying that american politics has typically been more structured around issues of identity than around issues or ideology _meta_end_dot_

 in northeastern urban areas for example italian americans have traditionally been republicans for no better reason than that irish americans have traditionally been democrats _meta_end_dot_

 similarly white protestants were republicans because catholics were democrats except for the italians but southern white protestants were democrats because abe lincoln was a republican _meta_end_dot_

 i tend to agree that this tradition hasn t been the most admirable element of the american political system but parties organized around clumsy ethno sectarian coalitions are the practical alternative to the much bemoaned partisan polarization of the present day _meta_end_dot_

 on the democratic side the candidates have allowed almost no ideological daylight to shine between them so you get identity based coalitions _meta_end_dot_

 on the gop side there are bigger ideological differences so the voters aren t breaking down as strictly along demographic lines _meta_end_dot_

 even here though each republican is presenting himself as the one true reagan conservative instead of explicitly self identifying as representing an ideological sub sect _meta_end_dot_
