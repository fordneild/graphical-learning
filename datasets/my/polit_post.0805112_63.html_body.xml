  this poll result flagged by kevin drum really is depressing _meta_end_dot_

 only _meta_number_ref_ percent of _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ officers holding the rank of major or lieutenant commander and above support the idea of allowing openly gay or lesbian americans to serve in the military as a means of boosting recruitment _meta_end_dot_

 fifty eight percent support lowering education standard _meta_number_ref_ percent supporting offering citizenship to foreigners willing to serve this sounds like a terrible fall of the roman empire idea to me _meta_number_ref_ percent support a draft _meta_end_dot_

 this suggests that even if shifts in public opinion have taken some of the sting out of the gays in the military question as an issue of electoral politics a president obama or a president clinton would still face significant resistance from within the armed forces to implementing a changed policy _meta_end_dot_

 alternatively and more optimistically support for a change may be so anemic because officers simply don t think that lifting the don t ask don t tell policy would in practice generate a substantial number of new recruits _meta_end_dot_

 insofar as that s what people are thinking i m inclined to agree lower educational standards is a far more practical way of generating additional bodies _meta_end_dot_

 meanwhile the current downturn in the labor market is likely to produce an uptick in recruiting _meta_end_dot_

 fundamentally though the gays in the military issue is a question of justice and equity and not really an issue about recruiting _meta_end_dot_
