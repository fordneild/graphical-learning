  gotta say i m a little baffled by knicks fans booing the danillo gallinari pick _meta_end_dot_

 maybe he ll work out well as an nba player and maybe he won t about the same thing you could say about anyone picked sixth in an average draft year _meta_end_dot_

 this is about where all the draft experts expecting him to go and john hollinger s euroleague translation formula says he ll be _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 the sixth best player in the draft wizards get javale mcgee meanwhile but i would have rather seen kosta koufos _meta_end_dot_
