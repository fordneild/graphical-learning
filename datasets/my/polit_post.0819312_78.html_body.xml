  deliciouspundit asks what d you think about david appell s smackdown of you the only thing i have to say to defend myself from those charges is that i don t think the post was really about why i suck it was about why the punditsphere as a whole sucks with me just as a prominent example _meta_end_dot_

 and he s right _meta_end_dot_

 to gain any worthwhile information about any topic whatsoever you need to be reading the work of someone with real expertise _meta_end_dot_

 to develop real expertise requires years of study research etc _meta_end_dot_

 and years of study research etc _meta_end_dot_

 can t be adequately condensed into a blog post _meta_end_dot_

 thus blog reading is a completely worthless exercise and nobody should really engage in it _meta_end_dot_

 i started writing this blog as a hobby i thought it would be a fun thing to do _meta_end_dot_

 and i not only continue to enjoy writing it but people pay me to write it _meta_end_dot_

 but the mere fact that i m writing it doesn t make it a worthwhile thing to read which is why the overwhelming majority of americans have never read this blog and never will _meta_end_dot_
