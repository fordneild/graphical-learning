  part of the dynamics of the primary campaign has been a certain tendency of foreign policy issues to go into eclipse as the leading contenders from each side compete with one another for the affections of base voters who tend to be motivated by each coalition s core economic and cultural interests _meta_end_dot_

 but tom edsall wisely points out that even if the economic situation worsens a general election campaign is bound to have a hefty focus on terrorism and security if for no other reason than that the gop doesn t really have any other good options _meta_end_dot_

 brian katulis says some smart things about this deeper into the piece the most nuanced analysis of the politics of terror was provided by brian katulis a less well known figure in the democratic foreign policy establishment who is a senior fellow at the center for american progress where he is a senior advisor to the center s middle east progress project _meta_end_dot_

 i wouldn t say that democrats have avoided national security as much as they have not yet developed a coherent narrative that simply goes beyond bush screwed things up conservatives have an overarching story when it comes to talking about national security it s not dissimilar to bush s narrative there are bad people out there we need to go out there and try to kill them ourselves before they get us _meta_end_dot_

 simplistic and applied to many different threats but it s kind of an easy story line _meta_end_dot_

 it s those political consulting classes on the democratic side who are particularly wounded and still operating on the defensive when it comes to national security which is truly a stunning thing when you think about it given all of the strategic errors conservatism is responsible for on the national security front the last seven years _meta_end_dot_

 so i think there s a sweet spot for democrats to actually say something that connects the dots on the national security and terrorism front one that actually responds to a need from the american people to hear a viable alternative but we re just not hearing it yet at that political communications level _meta_end_dot_

 we re seeing and hearing tick lists that make the broader public s eyes glaze over _meta_end_dot_

 on the conservative side we hear a story line a batshit crazy one for the most part that got us in the predicament that we re in now but hey it s a story _meta_end_dot_

 most people would rather go to a movie that has a plot i would add that one thing i still don t see from democrats on these issues is the correct atmospherics of confidence _meta_end_dot_

 when the candidates talk about most things they talk about them with an apparent air that they believe everything they re saying _meta_end_dot_

 but when they talk about terrorism or iraq they have a tendency in my view to often sound like they re stuck in _meta_number_ref_ nervous defensive cautious _meta_end_dot_

 they don t sound like a political party that believes that the evident failures of bush s policies throughout _meta_number_ref_ and _meta_number_ref_ played a major role in boosting their party s political fortunes _meta_end_dot_

 and they don t sound to me as if they re eager to engage with these issues _meta_end_dot_

 but while confidence alone is no guarantee of success going into a fight believing your going to lose is a recipe for trouble _meta_end_dot_
