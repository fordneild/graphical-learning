  here s an interesting nugget none of the leading contenders for the democratic presidential nomination is likely to embrace that said michael o hanlon who suspended his ties to the campaign of sen _meta_end_dot_

 hillary rodham clinton d n y after he wrote that bush s troop buildup was yielding positive results _meta_end_dot_

 since o hanlon was still being quoted in the media as a clinton supporter a few weeks ago i have to imagine the campaign finally got sick of him and got him to buzz off _meta_end_dot_

 but of course things can change when one shifts from primary mode to general election mode and i m not sure what suspended his ties is really supposed to mean _meta_end_dot_

 what s more o hanlon s always got opportunity _meta_number_ref_ to play around with _meta_end_dot_
