  from nbc s coverage of its new poll showing a substantial obama lead the _meta_number_ref_ pound ball and chain around mccain s foot is george w _meta_end_dot_

 bush hart says _meta_end_dot_

 unless he figures out a way to cut it loose he s going to be dragging it throughout this election this tends to get discussed in quasi mystical terms like nobody can say what would suffice to cut mccain loose from bush _meta_end_dot_

 but it would really be quite easy _meta_end_dot_

 the crux of the matter is that most voters think bush has been a bad president and would like to see different policies implemented _meta_end_dot_

 obama goes out on the campaign trail says bush has been a bad president and then proposes policies that are different from bush s _meta_end_dot_

 john mccain could do this too _meta_end_exclamation_

 but he doesn t say bush has been a bad president _meta_end_dot_

 he campaigned for bush in _meta_number_ref_ and even more so campaigned for his re election in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 he seems to have no regrets about that _meta_end_dot_

 on the trail he s made continuing bush s iraq policies the centerpiece of his campaign _meta_end_dot_

 at the heart of his economic agenda is extending bush s tax policies and his health care agenda is the same as bush s _meta_end_dot_

 he joined bush in opposing the climate security act endorses bush s approach to iran and agrees with bush that no action should be taken to provide people with viable alternatives to driving _meta_end_dot_

 consequently he s got this _meta_number_ref_ pound ball and chain around his leg _meta_end_dot_

 but he could cut it off easily enough _meta_end_dot_

 the trouble is that his substantive views seem to be very similar to bush s and he s dependent on the financial and logistical support of a very similar interest group coalition to the one behind bush _meta_end_dot_
