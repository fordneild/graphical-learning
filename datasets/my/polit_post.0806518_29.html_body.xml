  the world in numbers for our current print issue is a nifty map of the overtaxed highway infrastructure in our major urban areas _meta_end_dot_

 under the circumstances the case for more transportation infrastructure is compelling but it s worth underscoring the fact that you re never going to have anything more than a very temporary solution to congestion problems until you start implementing congestion pricing _meta_end_dot_

 building a highway after all costs money _meta_end_dot_

 but it creates something of value the chance to drive on an uncrowded roadway _meta_end_dot_

 but if you just give this valuable opportunity away for free then people wind up consuming too much of it and soon enough there s no uncrowded roadway left _meta_end_dot_

 it s just like overfishing or any other tragedy of the commons issue _meta_end_dot_

 when you see construction of a new unpriced and it s not likely that it ll soon become overcrowded you re looking at a porkalicious bridge to nowhere sort of phenomenon where people are constructing something that has a cost out of proportion to its value _meta_end_dot_

 anything that s genuinely valuable and also given away for free is going to wind up overconsumed _meta_end_dot_

 which isn t to say that we shouldn t build roads _meta_end_dot_

 reasonably uncrowded highways really are valuable and we should want to have them near our major economic centers _meta_end_dot_

 but to get that we need to charge for access to them during peak travel periods _meta_end_dot_

 that will when done appropriately ease the overcrowding and create revenues that can subsidize activities with small to zero marginal costs like non peak driving and rail travel _meta_end_dot_
