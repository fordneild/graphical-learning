  freddie asks how does your own experience reflect on the fact that the supposedly democratizing aspects of blogs have been co opted by the traditional media _meta_end_question_

 do you think that there is a kind of failure in now being under the imprimatur of the atlantic _meta_end_question_

 doesn t the fact that every atlantic blogger is ivy league educated and old media connected undercut the notion that the web has opened up avenues in media previously denied to regular people _meta_end_question_

 i think that s the wrong way of looking at it _meta_end_dot_

 the fact that the atlantic s bloggers tend to have gone to fancy schools reflects the fact that as has long been the case it s really helpful to have gone to a fancy school if you want to get a job at a prestigious magazine _meta_end_dot_

 the democratizing power of the internet hasn t in other words democratized the hiring practices of the atlantic _meta_end_dot_

 what it has done however is democratized acquiring an audience _meta_end_dot_

 it used to be that to have a big audience for your writing you needed to get hired by a periodical with an established audience _meta_end_dot_

 but these days a very large portion of the most read political blogs are upstart operations dailykos firedoglake talking points memo atrios etc _meta_end_dot_

 that s where the democracy comes in _meta_end_dot_

 of course being associated with a prominent brand can help you get readers _meta_end_dot_

 and so can being well connected more generally _meta_end_dot_

 in particular it s much easier to launch a new online product if it s associated with an existing successful online product _meta_end_dot_

 the internet has not in other words completely eliminated the barriers to entry _meta_end_dot_

 but it has reduced them _meta_end_dot_

 it s difficult to start a new blog without institutional support and make it successful but it s easier than starting a new magazine _meta_end_dot_

 and it s easier for institutions of all kinds to launch or acquire blogs that become successful think of the center for american progress s wildly successful thinkprogress than it would be for those institutions to start new magazines _meta_end_dot_

 consequently the competition for eyeballs online is quite a bit fiercer than is the competition for print readers time competes with newsweek us news and world report and that s it no blog has such an empty niche and most newspapers don t have any competitors at all and established position isn t nearly as useful as it is in old media _meta_end_dot_

 does that mean the internet is a level playing field _meta_end_question_

 no _meta_end_dot_

 does it make online communications a completely democratic medium _meta_end_question_

 no _meta_end_dot_

 but is the field more level and more democratic than print _meta_end_question_

 absolutely _meta_end_dot_
