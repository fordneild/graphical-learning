  the afl cio has pretty cleverly in my view created a union vets council to do stuff like air this ad i think liberals sometimes go overboard in terms of thinking that the right way to appeal to veterans is to double down on social services for veterans as a kind of pure transactional interest group politics _meta_end_dot_

 but this ad smartly links the specific critique of mccain s record on veterans issues to broader economic concerns _meta_end_dot_
