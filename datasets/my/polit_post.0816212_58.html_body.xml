  i didn t really care for central michel richard when i went there not that it s terrible but i had an it was fine but reaction to it and ever since i ve been eager to condemn it as overrated but i ve been unsure how highly rated it is _meta_end_dot_

 ezra klein doesn t like it either _meta_end_exclamation_

 but now that it s won a james beard award i can officially proclaim it underrated update by which of course i mean overrated _meta_end_dot_

 by contrast the bagaduce lunch in brooksville me which apparently also won an award of some kind offers absolutely delicious fried seafood baskets in a delightful outdoors setting for just a fraction of what michel richard is charging for his pretentious take on unpretentious food _meta_end_dot_
