  i m just getting home from what i think qualifies as my first ever event on the washington cocktail party circuit in a neighborhood so fancy i hadn t realized it existed and see hillary clinton s on tv giving her victory speech from kentucky _meta_end_dot_

 somehow i don t see this speech turning things around and securing her the nomination _meta_end_dot_

 i get the sense watching her talk that she realizes this though _meta_end_dot_

 a certain tension of the feisty underdog is gone she s smiling and having fun talking about the issues that matter to her _meta_end_dot_

 update okay now she s shifted back into campaign flim flam _meta_end_dot_

 apparently kentucky is the only state that counts and she s talking tough about running all the way to the convention _meta_end_dot_

 i m back to being disgusted by her her staff and her campaign and regret having said anything mildly positive above _meta_end_dot_
