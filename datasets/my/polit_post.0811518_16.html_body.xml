  the hill has a disappointing in terms of its content the journalism is good article about congressional democrats being not so enthusiastic about the ambitious health care reform plans from barack obama and hillary clinton _meta_end_dot_

 this is one of several reasons why i ve been unable to get too worked up about the superiority of clinton s health plan in my assessment what clinton is proposing isn t ambitious enough on the merits while obama s less ambitious plan is still more ambitious than what s legislatively feasible _meta_end_dot_

 various legislators concerns about cost also remind us of the dog that should be barking louder in the domestic debate the budget _meta_end_dot_

 insofar as the next president intends to pursue a serious program of deficit reduction it s just not going to be possible to enact a very ambitious agenda of new programmatic spending it won t be politically possible to raise taxes by a sufficient amount to do both _meta_end_dot_

 john edwards clearly marked himself out as someone who was willing to put deficit concerns aside for his programs but neither clinton nor obama have followed him down that path _meta_end_dot_

 but in context a promise to reduce the deficit amounts to both candidates having their fingers crossed behind their backs when they talk about substantial new spending on health care education or anything else _meta_end_dot_
