  ezra klein chides brian beutler and i for focusing too much on health insurance companies and one thing i d caution liberals of is letting the insurers loom too large in our minds _meta_end_dot_

 they are one of many impediments to reform but for various reasons we tend to think of them as the primary obstacle _meta_end_dot_

 the cost of people relying on private for profit firms as their primary source of insurance for medical expenses is large _meta_end_dot_

 when you pay out of pocket for health care your money is going to buy health care services _meta_end_dot_

 when a public sector programs pays for health care your tax dollars are going to buy some administrative bureaucracy and health care services _meta_end_dot_

 when a private sector insurance firms pays for health care your premiums are going to buy some administrative bureaucracy plus some marketing plus some risk analysis aimed at avoiding acquiring the wrong customers plus some people whose job it is to find ways to deny legitimate claims plus health care services _meta_end_dot_

 but when i hear about how ron wyden and ahip are getting along marvelously i don t think oh look the prospects for reform are better than i thought i think oh look we re going to get an expensive and crappy reform it s worth keeping in mind that a lot of the liberal interest group pressure on the health care front is aimed primarily at improving the competitive posture of unionized firms vis vis non union or foreign rivals rather than at improving america s health outcomes _meta_end_dot_
