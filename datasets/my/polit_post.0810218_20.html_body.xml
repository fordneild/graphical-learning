  jonathan rauch writing in the atlantic makes the case that john mccain should be understood not as a conservative heretic but as an old school burkean conservative at a time when much of the gop may have come unmoored from those traditional roots _meta_end_dot_

 i think there s a lot of truth to this analysis though i don t really think it can account for everything mccain did early in the bush administration a lot of the positions he staked out for a couple of years there seem explicable primarily as driven by anti bush pique that he eventually got over but it neglects the whole topic of foreign policy _meta_end_dot_

 which is fine the other issues are important too _meta_end_dot_

 but foreign policy questions are mccain s passion he s chosen to put them at the center of his campaign and there s really nothing at all burkean about mccain s take on them _meta_end_dot_

 the our country is democratic democracy is awesome therefore we should try to conquer the entire world in the name of spreading democracy syllogism at the core of mccain enduring peace built on freedom is straight out of the french revolution _meta_end_dot_
