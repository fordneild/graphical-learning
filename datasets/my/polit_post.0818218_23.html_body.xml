  chad ford repeats a common assessment of andris biedrins biedrins falls a little bit into the anderson varejao category energetic big man whose stats don t tell the whole story in terms of on court contributions but here s the thing unless by stats you mean per game scoring average and nothing else the story biedrins stats tell you is that he s a very good player _meta_end_dot_

 his stats tell me that he average _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ rebounds per game in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ mpg _meta_end_dot_

 they tell me that his _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ ppg came on an extraordinarily good _meta_number_ref_ percent field goal percentage _meta_end_dot_

 they tell me that the warriors defense was better with biedrins on the floor _meta_end_dot_

 these contributions are perfectly quantifiable _meta_end_dot_
