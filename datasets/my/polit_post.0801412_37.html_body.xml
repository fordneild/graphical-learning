  bill kristol on the new york times breaking a major story back in june of _meta_number_ref_ i think the attorney general has an absolute obligation to consider prosecution public editor clark hoyt reports rosenthal said kristol s comment about prosecution bothered him _meta_end_dot_

 it was rosenthal said a heavy accusation that put him in a category other than a journalist but he said that op ed columnists are not necessarily traditional journalists and he did not think that holding one opinion should be the basis for selecting or rejecting a columnist _meta_end_dot_

 sulzberger said the times wanted a columnist who brought to our pages a deeply held and well articulated point of view in line with what you might call the conservative republican movement _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 our op ed page is a marketplace of ideas _meta_end_dot_

 he ll strengthen the discussion spencer ackerman observes truly a liberal fascist is one who won t take his own side in a putsch joking aside sulzberger s comments are revealing _meta_end_dot_

 clearly one ought to consume a diversity of points of view _meta_end_dot_

 that s why back when he was still blogging i always liked to read max sawicky s brand of lefty economics even though i m more inclined toward brad delong s brand of center left technocracy _meta_end_dot_

 for that matter tyler cowen and alex tabbarok are one of my daily must reads as well _meta_end_dot_

 i highly recommend the american scene as an interesting source of various kinds of rightwingery as well as the technology liberation front for a free market perspective on tech policy _meta_end_dot_

 and of course there s my colleagues andrew sullivan megan mcardle and ross douthat _meta_end_dot_

 a healthy intellectual diet needs diversity _meta_end_dot_

 but does it really require a point of view in line with what you might call the conservative republican movement irrespective of its merits _meta_end_question_

 i think there are lots of smart people who have some views on some subjects that are in line with the conservative movement but to hire a columnist purely because his views mirror the line from the conintern is absurd _meta_end_dot_

 suppose the conservative movement wants to mislead people about something or other _meta_end_dot_

 it happens fairly often _meta_end_dot_

 now the times s obligation is to publish articles designed to mislead the times s audience _meta_end_question_

 really _meta_end_question_

 and we re supposed to pay to acquire a product that s dedicated to publishing all the news that s fit to print plus some stuff that s in line with the conservative republican movement why would we do that _meta_end_question_
