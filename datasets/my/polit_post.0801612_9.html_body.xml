  i ve got a guardian piece up about the debate basic takeaway point is that when the democrats turn away from trivia and toward substance one is overwhelmingly reminded of the lack of big disagreements between them _meta_end_dot_

 watching the race you get caught up and of course since it s an important decision even small differences loom large _meta_end_dot_

 but objectively the most noteworthy thing about it is how small those differences are _meta_end_dot_

 one note of worry few big disagreements about big ideas are in play on the democratic field _meta_end_dot_

 for now most liberals find that consensus heartening but we may come to regret it if it means that the eventual winner emerges into the field of battle without having really tested his or her arguments against a candidate willing to draw sharp lines of contrast _meta_end_dot_

 indeed even though these are views i don t hold i wish someone in the field was saying the surge is working _meta_end_dot_

 i wish someone was saying that an _meta_number_ref_ percent reduction in carbon emissions by _meta_number_ref_ was unrealistic and likely to cripple the economy _meta_end_dot_

 i wish someone was saying we can t afford the kind of health care spending these folks are putting on the table _meta_end_dot_

 i d like to see the candidates dealing with the obvious opposition arguments _meta_end_dot_

 instead this was probably the high point it s not though an incredibly beefy moment _meta_end_dot_

 like josh marshall i was a bit confused by msnbc s rush to proclaim hillary clinton the winner _meta_end_dot_

 what i think she did was turn in a front runner s performance _meta_end_dot_

 but that s only a win if she s really the front runner and i don t think that s clear at all _meta_end_dot_
