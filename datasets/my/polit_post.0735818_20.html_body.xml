  bruce bartlett responds to my post on his book matt s reaction is exactly what i expected from the left _meta_end_dot_

 since the history cannot be denied they will sweep it under the rug as old news and boring news at that _meta_end_dot_

 but considering the recent flap about reagan s philadelphia mississippi speech in _meta_number_ref_ i don t think liberals can dismiss my argument without also dismissing their own efforts to use _meta_number_ref_ year old speeches to damn the republican party for racism _meta_end_dot_

 they can t have it both ways _meta_end_dot_

 either history matters or it doesn t _meta_end_dot_

 no no no _meta_end_exclamation_

 i don t think the history should be swept under the rug at all _meta_end_dot_

 what i think is that the history reflects well on present members of the democratic party _meta_end_dot_

 the political views of the southern democrats were unconscionably evil and the corrupt bargain national democratic party figures struck with them was a terrible thing _meta_end_dot_

 but in a series of intense political battles the democratic party eventually broke decisively with that heritage prompting breakaway segregationist campaigns in _meta_number_ref_ and _meta_number_ref_ and eventually leading the bulk of the white supremacist constituency to drift to the republican party _meta_end_dot_

 the significance of the history of race in america and of the centrality of the democrats corrupt bargain with white supremacy to american political history really shouldn t be minimized _meta_end_dot_

 but what it shows is that the democratic party s decision to embrace the civil rights movement and the republican party s decision to embrace opposition to civil rights has been integral to the republican party s political successes toward the end of the _meta_number_ref_th century _meta_end_dot_
