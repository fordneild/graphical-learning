  she s not a brilliant orator but in her better moments she has a way of making it work _meta_end_dot_

 like tonight she observes politics isn t a game it s about your lives and your problems then she goes off onto a whole list of kinds of people with kinds of problems that she s prepared to solve _meta_end_dot_

 in that context she turns her very lack of rhetorical flourish into a kind of signifier of seriousness _meta_end_dot_

 she s speaking plainly and directly telling you what she wants to do for you if she wins and asking you to support her for clear cut concrete reasons _meta_end_dot_

 you don t vote for her because you want to hear from her at greater length you vote for her because you want to see action _meta_end_dot_
