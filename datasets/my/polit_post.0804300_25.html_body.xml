  here s hillary clinton s take on getting shut out over the weekend she said she never expected to do well in any of those contests even though she had been favored to win maine _meta_end_dot_

 clinton repeated her criticism that the caucus system is undemocratic and caters mostly to party activists _meta_end_dot_

 as for louisiana you had a very strong and very proud african american electorate which i totally respect and understand clinton said _meta_end_dot_

 it s worth noting that there was a time a time called _meta_number_ref_ when clinton was expecting to hold her own among african americans _meta_end_dot_

 not necessarily win the black vote but do well enough to get by _meta_end_dot_

 for a contrast women were a majority of participants in every single democratic primary and caucus so every time obama won he had to stay at least somewhat competitive within the women sub sample _meta_end_dot_

 for clinton that kind of performance among african americans now seems out of reach but it wasn t ever thus _meta_end_dot_

 similarly the idea that caucuses are unfairly disadvantaging the establishment candidate would have struck most people as very odd before the voting began _meta_end_dot_

 the truth seems to be that clinton simply spent more money on consultants and less on organizers and a paucity of organizers can hurt you badly in a caucus _meta_end_dot_
