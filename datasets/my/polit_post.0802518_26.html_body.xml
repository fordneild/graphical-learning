  it seems that during the debate last night mike huckabee proposed adding two extra lanes on i _meta_number_ref_ all the way from bangor to miami _meta_end_dot_

 david freddoso doesn t approve sniffing a hint of fdr about the plan _meta_end_dot_

 ross douthat s all for it _meta_end_dot_

 i won t rehearse the standard argument against the view that if we just build enough highways our traffic problems will go away but what i d really like to see in our urban corridors is true high speed intercity rail _meta_end_dot_

 the tgv in france cruises at _meta_number_ref_ miles per hour for commercial purposes _meta_end_dot_

 that d make the _meta_number_ref_ or so mile trip between dc and charlotte something you d probably want to do on the train _meta_end_dot_

 similarly the _meta_number_ref_ or so miles between charlotte and atlanta the _meta_number_ref_ miles between atlanta and jacksonville and the _meta_number_ref_ miles between jacksonville and miami _meta_end_dot_

 and that of course is to say nothing of the possibilities of high speed rail along the boston washington corridor _meta_end_dot_

 in the real world of course there are a million reasons why we re not going to build a boston to miami high speed rail line up to european or asian standards _meta_end_dot_

 but we really should and there are of course other appropriate corridors in parts of the country where i don t happen to live it would make a lot of things in life better and it s a bit pathetic that dysfunctional politics in the united states has just doomed the erstwhile greatest country ever to get by with inferior infrastructure _meta_end_dot_
