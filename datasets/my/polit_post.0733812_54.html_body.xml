  rudy giuliani runs an ad in which he explains i know that reducing taxes produces more revenues which is an impossible thing for giuliani to know since it s false fortunately the washington post and the new york times both have ad fact check features designed to set the record straight _meta_end_dot_

 but the times doesn t notice what rudy said and the post further misleads saying a matter of fierce dispute among economists brendan nyhan asks what s the point of fact checking if you re not going to call rudy on that claim i think you d have to say that the point is pretty clear _meta_end_dot_

 if a candidate puts out an ad that says things that aren t true and newspapers ignore it then maybe the claim is true and maybe it s false _meta_end_dot_

 by contrast if the papers fact check the ad and don t call the claim false then you the reader can be confident that the claim isn t false _meta_end_exclamation_

 why would a newspaper do that _meta_end_question_

 well bob somerby could probably give you a theory or two _meta_end_dot_

 at the end of the day there s no denying that giuliani is a tough and b a republican both things beloved by the national political press _meta_end_dot_

 more broadly to an almost unique extent the entire giuliani campaign is a pure creature of positive press coverage i liked his speeches on _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ and the days immediately following too but nothing about them suggested to me this is a man with a sound understanding of the national security challenges facing america it was just an awestruck press corps that started in with the america s mayor business giving him the man of the year award suggesting he should be taken seriously as a thinker on topics way outside his area of expertise etc etc ec _meta_end_dot_
