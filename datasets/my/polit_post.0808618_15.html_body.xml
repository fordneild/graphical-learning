  i was a little bit confused initially by john mccain s plan to deal with the crisis in the housing markets because on first read there doesn t seem to be a plan there at all _meta_end_dot_

 on second read there s just no plan _meta_end_dot_

 rather there s fear that there might be a plan _meta_end_dot_

 but john mccain s promising to put a stop to that _meta_end_dot_

 ryan avent remarks as best i can tell he must figure that offering a mortgage policy solution that s far stingier than that put forth by one of the least popular presidents in modern times will burnish his maverick image thus earning him more press cred _meta_end_dot_

 and then maybe the press won t really talk that much about his stingy mortgage policy _meta_end_question_

 he d better hope they don t because if the american public finds out that he feels bear deserved its bailout and homeowners deserve nothing they re going to be pissed _meta_end_dot_

 right _meta_end_dot_

 mccain s thinking on economics seems driven by a kind of eat your peas moralism _meta_end_dot_

 the press which always favors economic pain for people other than themselves their owners and their advertisers tends to like this sort of thing _meta_end_dot_

 like when mccain tried to run in the michigan primary by promising voters that he thought their state s economy was doomed _meta_end_dot_

 but actual voters don t much like that kind of thing i think there s skeptical as to how much different government policy makes in their lives but they want policymakers to be at least trying to make their lives better _meta_end_dot_
