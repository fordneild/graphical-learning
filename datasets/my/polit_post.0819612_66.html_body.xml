  so john mccain has promised to balance the budget but has also promised a series of lavish tax cuts for the rich defense spending hikes and endless wars that makes balancing the budget impossible _meta_end_dot_

 so far so good just a little of the old straight talk _meta_end_dot_

 but then for some reason he actually provided the washington post editorial page with a budget plan perhaps counting on their love of bush mccain style foreign policy to cause them to forget how to add resulting in an editorial about how their numbers are nonsense _meta_end_dot_

 in a reality development the video professor is offering to help mccain learn how to use a computer between the built in calculator and widely available spreadsheet and financial planning software maybe once the professor s through with him mccain will have his budget problems figured out _meta_end_dot_
