  it appears that john mccain is a liar just hours after the times story was posted the mccain campaign issued a point by point response that depicted the letters as routine correspondence handled by his staff and insisted that mccain had never even spoken with anybody from paxson or alcalde fay about the matter _meta_end_dot_

 no representative of paxson or alcalde fay personally asked senator mccain to send a letter to the fcc the campaign said in a statement emailed to reporters _meta_end_dot_

 but that flat claim seems to be contradicted by an impeccable source mccain himself _meta_end_dot_

 i was contacted by mr _meta_end_dot_

 paxson on this issue mccain said in the september _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ deposition obtained by newsweek _meta_end_dot_

 he wanted their approval very bad for purposes of his business _meta_end_dot_

 i believe that mr _meta_end_dot_

 paxson had a legitimate complaint at this point it s worth observing something about the general mccain press dynamic _meta_end_dot_

 one thing reporters like about mccain is that he offers shoot from the hip statements on topics that come up in discussions _meta_end_dot_

 reporters like this for good reason the carefully worded artfully hedged statements in which the vast majority of politicians speak nowadays is really annoying _meta_end_dot_

 that said politicians don t talk like that because they re all douchebags they talk like that because that s how you have to talk _meta_end_dot_

 if you make the slightest slip up or misstatement the press will pounce all over you _meta_end_dot_

 unless that is you re john mccain _meta_end_dot_

 if you re john mccain you can make an obviously false statement like claiming you ve never done favors for special interests or lobbyists or saying that no representative of paxson or alcalde fay personally asked senator mccain to send a letter to the fcc when you yourself said in the past that you d been contacted by paxson and the press just lets it slide _meta_end_dot_

 why _meta_end_question_

 because they like him _meta_end_dot_

 but they like him because he s spontaneous _meta_end_dot_

 but he s spontaneous because they let him get away with this stuff _meta_end_dot_

 and they let him get away with it because they like him _meta_end_dot_

 it s what makes him such a formidable political figure he can run around doing things no other politicians could get away with and actually attract praise for it _meta_end_dot_

 unless of course it all comes crashing down _meta_end_dot_

 if reporters start judging mccain by their usual rules then he ll have to turn himself into just another carefully hedging pol _meta_end_dot_

 but one who s a million years old one who thinks the problem with the bush foreign policy is that we haven t started enough wars and one who doesn t even care about the economic challenges facing the country _meta_end_dot_
