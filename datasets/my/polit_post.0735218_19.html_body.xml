  remember when trent lott was lavishing praise on strom thurmond s _meta_number_ref_ run for president on a white supremacist platform _meta_end_question_

 remember how most of his fellow conservatives disavowed him _meta_end_question_

 well here s senator gordon smith r or praising lott s defense of white supremacy _meta_end_dot_

 and then orrin hatch r ut did it _meta_end_dot_

 and then arlen specter r pa did it _meta_end_dot_

 i kind of assume specter s too old to run for another term and utah s the most republican state in the country but smith needs to run for re election in oregon next year so i m pretty surprised to see this sort of gaffe coming from him _meta_end_dot_

 it s true that his second degree praise of thurmond and the dixiecrats isn t quite as egregious as lott s but this is still pretty despicable _meta_end_dot_
