  garry wills has a fascinating essay in the new york review of books comparing barack obama s race speech to abraham lincoln s cooper union address _meta_end_dot_

 wills makes the case that though the situation today is of lesser magnitude than the occurrences of _meta_number_ref_ that obama and lincoln faced structurally similar challenges of needing to stay true to their promise of change while offering reassurance that they weren t closet radicals _meta_end_dot_

 of course it should be said that for all lincoln s greatness he only got _meta_number_ref_ percent of the vote in the _meta_number_ref_ general election so arguably wasn t all that successful in reassuring people about his views _meta_end_dot_
