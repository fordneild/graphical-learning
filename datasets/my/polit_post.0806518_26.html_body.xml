  i dismissed rush limbaugh s efforts to get conservatives to go vote for hillary clinton in order to make things easier for john mccain _meta_end_dot_

 markos efforts to do something similar on mitt romey s behalf didn t achieve anything _meta_end_dot_

 and after all why should it work the motive for voting is mostly expressive so people are disinclined to do this kind of thing _meta_end_dot_

 but dave weigel rounds up some evidence that the rush effect was real and put clinton over the top in texas _meta_end_dot_

 and of course it worked _meta_end_dot_

 clinton still won t win the nomination after mississippi and wyoming she ll be further behind in the delegate count than ever with fewer than ever delegates still up for grabs but for another couple of months mccain will have a high profile anti obama surrogate in the field telling people the likely nominee is unfit for executive leadership _meta_end_dot_
