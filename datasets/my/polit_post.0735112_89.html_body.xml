  jim henley fesses up i m officially wrong about the _meta_number_ref_ redskins as of last night _meta_end_dot_

 i predicted _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ they ve got a good chance of doubling that _meta_end_dot_

 they are not an awful team _meta_end_dot_

 rather they have earned a descriptor too easily bestowed in today s nfl mediocre he worries however that recent successes will tempt the staff _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 to take it for validation of their overall approach well just to further enhance jim s worries about complacency it seems to me that one might look at an _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ season assuming of course the skins can achieve that lofty feat of mediocrity that featured a young quarterback tons of offensive line injuries and the murder of a key defensive player points to good things for the future _meta_end_dot_

 of course zombie sean taylor s not going to be suiting up to shore up the secondary but it would seem perfectly reasonable to hope for modest improvements in jason campbell s game plus fewer injuries to produce a better result next season _meta_end_dot_
