  ana marie cox in a general obama won t be running against clinton he ll be running against mccain a politician that has actually taken political risks and endured the wrath of party hacks in order to make progress on real issues what has obama done _meta_end_question_

 show me a single issue or piece of legislation where obama has done something politically unpopular in order to move forward toward a greater goal i pointed out that this argument hasn t made much of a difference so far _meta_end_dot_

 ah replied the adviser that s because clinton can t show that she s done it either what s more he said the press will stop giving obama a free ride in the general _meta_end_dot_

 mccain will be out there holding court on his bus or his plane providing unfettered access to both reporters and voters and journalists will no longer be able to ignore obama s lack of access and lack of interaction with real people _meta_end_dot_

 in fact it ll be the only thing they talk about _meta_end_dot_

 both ezra klein and ross douthat seem to me to be unduly impressed by this argument _meta_end_dot_

 it s true that the press corps will jizz all over itself for john mccain but that kind of thing will only take him so far _meta_end_dot_

 in terms of getting things done what s john mccain ever accomplished _meta_end_question_

 beyond a minor years old procedural reform to the campaign finance system nothing _meta_end_dot_

 and he s had much more time in washington in which to get something done _meta_end_dot_

 but in mccain s past _meta_number_ref_ years in congress he s managed to author not a single piece of legislation that s been signed into law that helps any real people with any real problems _meta_end_dot_

 he s spent a lot of time posturing on the sunday shows and affiliated himself with a few pieces of modestly progressive legislation that didn t get passed and then disavowed all those bills _meta_end_dot_

 more broadly though mccain is a formidable candidate in some respects experience is the time honored election argument of losers _meta_end_dot_

 if voters really valued experience then veteran senators would be getting elected president all the time _meta_end_dot_

 instead it almost never happens because normal people don t think that long duration in congress an institution that s invariably incredibly unpopular is an appealing character trait _meta_end_dot_
