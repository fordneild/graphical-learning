  i read matt bai s article on how we can understand the current democratic primary as a referendum on bill clinton s tenure in office and ed kilgore s remarks on it as well _meta_end_dot_

 on one level i m not entirely sure this is true _meta_end_dot_

 paul krugman s complaints about barack obama amount to accusing him of being unduly clintonian whereas he sees the actual clinton in the race as possessed of a bold populist fighting spirit _meta_end_dot_

 on the other hand given that bill clinton was in office very recently and that his wife is the front runner in this race and she s running primarily on her experience as a first lady it s natural for thoughts on the clinton administration to enter into things _meta_end_dot_

 it struck me contemplating this that i don t have any particularly strong feelings about the clinton administration _meta_end_dot_

 it seems to me that people who write about politics for a living are supposed to decide that he was either the great innovator who saves democrats from the hippies or else the evil destroyer who ruined everything _meta_end_dot_

 in truth he was a politician _meta_end_dot_

 like all politician his views on the merits of things drifted around over time and he responded a lot to the prevailing political pressures _meta_end_dot_

 and that s not to say he was a soulless calculating flip flopper _meta_end_dot_

 rather he was a politician and that s how politicians do _meta_end_dot_

 so anyways i do actually see the democratic primary through that lens _meta_end_dot_

 i m not sure how the future will unfold for american public policy but if a democrat wins the primary difference maker will be the environment in which he or she operates the state of public opinion the state of the congress the strength of progressive civil society groups etc _meta_end_dot_

 the structure of the campaign tends to obscure that but that s how it is _meta_end_dot_

 any of these people would happily become much more conservative in office than the game they re talking now if they thought that was the savvy move and any of them would shift left as well _meta_end_dot_

 it still matters who wins of course but it s only one of a million things that matter _meta_end_dot_
