  well the new york times s article on john mccain s relationship with vicky iseman sure did make mark salter mad _meta_end_dot_

 it s often unclear at times however what exactly salter is trying to say _meta_end_dot_

 the times story is a bit odd and innuendo y hinting at a sexual relationship between mccain and iseman but they clearly don t have the goods _meta_end_dot_

 salter says mccain spoke to new york times editor bill keller and denied any personal romantic involvement with iseman and said that he did not betray the public trust obviously i don t know whether or not mccain had sex with iseman _meta_end_dot_

 i suppose by what the meaning of the word is is standards he didn t even deny having had sex with iseman _meta_end_dot_

 certainly it d be a bit rich of mccain to get outraged that anyone would even suggest that he might engage in sexual improprieties _meta_end_dot_

 after all it s well known that he repeatedly cheated on his first wife carol of a number of years with a variety of women before eventually dumping her for a much younger heiress whose family fortune was able to help finance his political career _meta_end_dot_

 that s well known i should say except to the electorate who would probably find that this sort of behavior detracts from mccain s character appeal _meta_end_dot_

 meanwhile there s all this stuff salter doesn t deny because again it s true about mccain s questionable ethics _meta_end_dot_

 he wrote letters to government regulators on behalf of the iseman s client he often flew on the corporate jets of business executives seeking his support he resigned as head of a non profit when news reports disclosed that the group was tapping the same kinds of unlimited corporate contributions he opposed including those from companies seeking his favor his senate office and his campaign are run by corporate lobbyists etc _meta_end_dot_

 meanwhile there s a storm of speculation surrounding the iseman story which continues to be a weird lede for the piece and we ll have to see what else comes out _meta_end_dot_
