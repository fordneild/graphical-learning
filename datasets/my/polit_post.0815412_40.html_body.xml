  noting that both hillary clinton and barack obama will be able to present arguments that they have won the popular vote who won depends on how you count ed kilgore observes the two things no one can deny is that it was in retrospect an awfully close race but one in which barack obama will finish with a lead in pledged delegates and barring some implosion in his general election standing the nomination all true _meta_end_dot_

 but given that the popular vote has no official standing for an unofficial assessment of how democratic voters feel about things it is instructive to look at the national polling _meta_end_dot_

 here things are pretty close but obama s held a decisive lead for a long time _meta_end_dot_

 roughly speaking it seems to be the case that some of the states that voted for clinton on february _meta_number_ref_ now prefer obama _meta_end_dot_

 so the person who wins the nomination by delegates will also be the person who most democrats prefer _meta_end_dot_

 and that s as it should be _meta_end_dot_

 no doubt had things gone different earlier in the campaign with clinton moving out to a decisive lead in delegates the polling would have coalesced around her too _meta_end_dot_

 but that s what happened and as things stand now there s a clear majority for obama _meta_end_dot_
