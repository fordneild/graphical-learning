  longtime troll tlb wants me to write about the announcement that the democratic convention will be simulcast in spanish _meta_end_dot_

 unlike anti immigrant obsessives i don t necessarily regard this kind of thing as a huge deal but i actually do think there s something lamentable about the trend toward a greater volume of spanish language political communication _meta_end_dot_

 it s just common sense that many jurisdictions provide services in spanish or whatever other languages may be commonly spoken in any given area _meta_end_dot_

 but to me it makes a lot of sense to say that we should work to maintain a monolingual political conversation that expects citizens to be able to deliberate with their fellow citizens in english _meta_end_dot_

 many countries have no realistic alternative other than to try to make bilingualism or more work but it s really difficult in practice will kymlicka says some smart things about this in politics in the vernacular as i recall and we shouldn t move in that direction _meta_end_dot_
