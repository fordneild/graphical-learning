  first off it seems that when hillary clinton was a practicing lawyer she took a job as a court appointed attorney for an indigent client and she sought to advance her client s interests zealously _meta_end_dot_

 newsday wants us to find that sleazy but it s the nature of the american legal system _meta_end_dot_

 it would have been irresponsible for her to do otherwise _meta_end_dot_

 second a photo surfaced of barack obama wearing some funny looking to american eyes clothing while on a trip to africa _meta_end_dot_

 this led to a bewildering series of charges and countercharges from the obama and clinton campaigns even though the whole thing was likely trumped up out of little or nothing by matt drudge to drive traffic _meta_end_dot_
