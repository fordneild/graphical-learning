  some new research indicates that teaching kids all these word problems about speeding trains and slices of pie may be a mistake and that children actually learn math better if you just teach them abstract equations from the get go _meta_end_dot_

 obviously i m in no position to judge my boring guess is that different approaches work best for different people and there should be some diversity of classroom methods available for different students but it s a bit bizarre how little effort we put into developing serious research based pedagogical methods _meta_end_dot_

 you d think this would be a major component of federal education policy but it s really not _meta_end_dot_
