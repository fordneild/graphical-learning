  an interesting contention from wilentz is that reagan got it right in a big way on the so called euromissile controversy the subject of the memorable _meta_number_ref_ luftballoons _meta_end_dot_

 wilentz says not only that the predictions of the naysayers proved wrong which is clearly true but that this was no sideshow _meta_end_dot_

 rather it was a very important showdown in the history of the cold war and may have played a role in gorbachev s emergence in _meta_number_ref_ i d be interested in learning more about the evidence here _meta_end_dot_

 it s plausible enough that a failure of the soviet hardliners in _meta_number_ref_ could have played an important role in gorbachev s rise but then again it might not be true _meta_end_dot_

 you d really need to be a soviet specialist to understand its role fully _meta_end_dot_

 either way as wilentz says the key move came later when gorbachev did come to power and reagan broke with the bulk of the conservative movement to decide to cooperate in good faith with the soviet reformers _meta_end_dot_

 wilentz attributes this to the fact that gorbachev had more experience with the left going back to the _meta_number_ref_s and _meta_number_ref_s and thus was more sensitive than a typical conservative to changes within the soviet leadership _meta_end_dot_
