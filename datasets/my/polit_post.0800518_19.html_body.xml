  ben smith has a giulianiesque mailer being sent out by afscme the public employees union on behalf of hillary clinton this is the kind of attack you really don t like to see from a progressive interest group _meta_end_dot_

 i understand that afscme chief gerald mcintee has a longstanding good relationship with the clinton family but in the even that barack obama becomes the nominee afscme s going regret having participated in this kind of smear against the democratic standard bearer _meta_end_dot_

 it s one thing for a group to attack a candidate on the group s key issues that s what groups are there for but this is just off topic fearmongering _meta_end_dot_

 several members of the afscme board apparently agree and sent out this letter we were therefore shocked and appalled to learn that our union through independent expenditures is squandering precious resources to wage a costly and deceptive campaign to oppose barack obama my understanding is that afscme is one of the more top down unions out there so it doesn t really matter if mcintee pisses off some board members _meta_end_dot_
