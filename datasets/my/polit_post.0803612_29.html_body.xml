  to be clear about something the big problem with america s sky high pentagon budget isn t merely that it s big we re obviously capable of spending this much without wrecking the national economy and we have in the past spent a higher share of our economy on this stuff it s that so much of it is so clearly unnecessary _meta_end_dot_

 fred kaplan notes for example that the iron laws of inter service rivalry dictate that the money be split up almost exactly evenly between the army air force and navy irrespective of need as i have noted before and i m sure will again the budget has been divvied up this way plus or minus _meta_number_ref_ percent each and every year since the _meta_number_ref_s _meta_end_dot_

 is it remotely conceivable that our national security needs coincide so precisely and so consistently over the span of nearly a half century with the bureaucratic imperatives of giving the army air force and navy an even share of the money _meta_end_question_

 again the question answers itself _meta_end_dot_

 as the army s budget goes up to meet the demands of iraq and afghanistan the air force s and navy s budgets have to go up by roughly the same share as well _meta_end_dot_

 it would be a miracle if this didn t sire a lot of waste and extravagance _meta_end_dot_

 what s more as kevin drum argues it s not as if this has been accomplished by each service coming up with brilliant but expensive ways to fight terrorism _meta_end_dot_

 rather the rigid budget formula has been matched by rigid adherence to an r d and procurement process developed in order to fight a large scale war with a peer competitor like the soviet union _meta_end_dot_

 when the cold war ended you saw some rationale shifting and arguments about the need to to use this stuff to fight china which has a relatively tiny military establishment no real capacity to project power and unlike the soviet union isn t really in a contest for global hegemony with the us anyway and then after _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ you still sometimes hear that and you sometimes just get told we need this stuff to fight terrorism _meta_end_dot_

 and of course in a super simplistic way it s probably true that all else being equal having an extra f _meta_number_ref_ raptor is better for counter terrorism purposes than not having it _meta_end_dot_

 but in the real world when you add up your f _meta_number_ref_s and your missile defense systems and your ddg_meta_number_ref_ and your virgina class submarines and all the rest little else is equal _meta_end_dot_

 this stuff is extremely expensive _meta_end_dot_

 so expensive in fact that to keep the purchasing order for it we wind up not actually procuring enough of the new equipment to fully replace our old stuff _meta_end_dot_

 we could lower our horizons a bit and make due with buying new and only slightly improved versions of existing military hardware which after all seems to work pretty well when it s not old and broken and save tons of money for other priorities _meta_end_dot_

 and don t just blame bush of course _meta_end_dot_

 ike skelton the top house democrat on the armed services committee released a statement yesterday calling bush s budget request a good and necessary increase meanwhile proposals embraced by both hillary clinton and barack obama to increase the number of ground troops in the military could be a good idea if this was done by shifting some spending from these not so necessary weapons programs over to manpower needs but as a pure increase that rather than being offset will drive further increases in air force and navy budgets to preserve the formula it just further entrenches the problem _meta_end_dot_

 at any rate fred kaplan s book daydream believers which is out now goes into a bunch of this _meta_end_dot_

 he also notes that things get even worse when in essence policymakers start believing the propaganda associated with this kind of graft driven endless buildup of equipment _meta_end_dot_

 the bush administration in particular as kaplan argues seems to have pointed out that this seemingly useless policy of ensuring an ever widening gap between us technological capabilities and those of any possible adversary must in fact have been super useful maybe it would allow us to totally remake the ground rules of the international order _meta_end_exclamation_

 regime change quick and cheap _meta_end_exclamation_

 why not _meta_end_exclamation_

 well we know how that turned out _meta_end_dot_
