  according to gallup americans don t just dislike the iraq war they downright dislike iraq _meta_end_dot_

 not as much as they dislike iran but they re pretty unenthusiastic about the place _meta_end_dot_

 what s more though americans have distaste for the palestinian authority they don t fear it _meta_end_dot_

 but when asked to name america s top enemy in the world iraq took second place have people not heard that saddam s been deposed behind iran but ahead of china and north korea _meta_end_dot_

 no real point to make about this just thought it was an interesting glimpse at the public mood _meta_end_dot_
