  i guess john mccain thinks outsourcing his strategic thinking to osama bin laden is such a great idea that he wants to brag about it as you know i was in iraq jordan israel france and england on my last visit _meta_end_dot_

 and a couple of days ago as you probably know an audiotape actually it was last week an audiotape was released where bin laden said and i have to quote bin laden _meta_end_dot_

 the nearest field to support our people in palestine is the iraqi field he urged palestinians and people of syria lebanon jordan and saudi arabia to quote help in support of their mujahedeen brothers in iraq which is the greatest opportunity and the biggest task now my friends for the first time i have seen osama bin laden and general petraeus in agreement and that is the central battleground in the battle against al qaeda is in iraq today _meta_end_dot_

 and that s what bin laden is saying and that s what general petraeus is saying and that s what i m saying my friends and my democrat opponents who want to pull out of iraq refuse to understand what s being said and what s happening and that is the central battleground is iraq in this struggle against radical islamic extremism _meta_end_dot_

 there s no question that as mccain points out here at some length that bin laden would really like to see an epic struggle in iraq between the united states military and an array of al qaeda recruits who inspired by the idea of a struggle against american occupation will flood into that country _meta_end_dot_

 as mccain says this is bin laden s view of how events in the world are unfolding _meta_end_dot_

 why mccain thinks the correct response is to do what bin laden wants i couldn t quite say _meta_end_dot_

 possibly he s just not very bright _meta_end_dot_
