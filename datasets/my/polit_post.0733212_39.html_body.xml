  marc ambinder flags a press account of bill clinton claiming to have been against the invasion of iraq even though i approved of afghanistan and opposed iraq from the beginning said clinton i still resent that i was not asked or given the opportunity to support those soldiers clinton has long been critical of the u s led invasion of iraq and called it a big mistake as far back as november of _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 marc notes that this is likely to muddy hillary clinton s message _meta_end_dot_

 nor does it seem um accurate to me _meta_end_dot_

 probably the best example of bill s contemporaneous thinking on iraq is his march _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ guardian op ed trust tony s judgment here clinton makes it clear that he sees blair as having spent the past year navigating a wise middle course between regime change hawks in the us and die hard anti war types on the continent _meta_end_dot_

 blair with great finesse had used threats of force to move the inspections ball down the road until we reached the point of mid march _meta_end_dot_

 clinton paid no note to the fact that the inspectors were on the ground saying there was no evidence of an iraqi nuclear program _meta_end_dot_

 indeed clinton contributed to some extent to the smokescreen of war by clouding this issue writing saddam has destroyed some missiles but beyond that he has done only what he thinks is necessary to keep the un divided on the use of force _meta_end_dot_

 the really important issues relating to chemical and biological weapons remain unresolved thus the central plank of the argument for war that it was necessary to invade in order to halt saddam s advance nuclear weapons program was swept under the rug at just the point where it was becoming clear that this talking point was false _meta_end_dot_

 clinton regret the outbreak of war but put the blame for it squarely on the shoulders of france russia and germany arguing that if a majority of the security council had adopted the blair approach saddam would have had no room for further evasion and he still might have disarmed without invasion and bloodshed _meta_end_dot_

 now it appears that force will be used to disarm and depose him clinton endorsed the view that saddam s alleged wmd arsenal was a terrorism threat there is too as both britain and america agree some risk of saddam using or transferring his weapons to terrorists then he concluded i wish that russia and france had supported blair s resolution _meta_end_dot_

 then hans blix and his inspectors would have been given more time and supprt for their work _meta_end_dot_

 but that s not where we are _meta_end_dot_

 blair is in a position not of his own making because iraq and other nations were unwilling to follow the logic of _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 in the post cold war world america and britain have been in tough positions before in _meta_number_ref_ when others wanted to lift sanctions on iraq and we said no in _meta_number_ref_ when we went into kosovo to stop ethnic cleansing _meta_end_dot_

 in each case there were voices of dissent _meta_end_dot_

 but the british american partnership and the progress of the world were preserved _meta_end_dot_

 now in another difficult spot prime minister blair will have to do what he believes to be right _meta_end_dot_

 i trust him to do that and hope that labor mps and the british people will too _meta_end_dot_

 what blair believed was right was of course invading iraq _meta_end_dot_

 obviously it s possible that clinton wrote a march _meta_number_ref_ op ed urging blind faith in tony blair s leadership then when blair invaded iraq a few days later was shocked to see him make such a mistake but then decided he better not say anything about the wisdom of the invasion until years later but it s not very plausible _meta_end_dot_

 for all intents and purposes clinton s public statements on the iraq issue like those of colin powell and tony blair were part of the push to round up moderate support for the war _meta_end_dot_

 i remember this stuff _meta_end_dot_

 i was one of the millions of americans who thought that sure george w _meta_end_dot_

 bush must be a maniac but if bill and hillary clinton and colin powell and madeleine albright and other clinton era officials like ken pollack and joe biden and so on and so forth think it s a good idea maybe i should have some more confidence _meta_end_dot_

 obviously that was a stupid stupid mistake _meta_end_dot_

 but i find it really offensive that people who abused the trust of citizens who admired them by selling us on this mess now want to turn around and do it again by pretending that never happened _meta_end_dot_
