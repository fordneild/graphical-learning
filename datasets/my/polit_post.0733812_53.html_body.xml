  barack obama says by reporting that iran halted its nuclear weapon development program four years ago because of international pressure the new national intelligence estimate makes a compelling case for less saber rattling and more direct diplomacy _meta_end_dot_

 the juxtaposition of this nie with the president s suggestion of world war iii serves as an important reminder of what we learned with the _meta_number_ref_ national intelligence estimate on iraq members of congress must carefully read the intelligence before giving the president any justification to use military force _meta_end_dot_

 there s a very subtle dig here at hillary clinton and john edwards noting that both of them unlike you or i or barack obama had access to the classified version of the _meta_number_ref_ nie on iraq a document that debunked substantial elements of the administration s case for war but which neither clinton nor edwards nor a great many other members of congress bothered to read before voting to authorize the use of force _meta_end_dot_

 meanwhile the john edwards says the new national intelligence estimate shows that george bush and dick cheney s rush to war with iran is in fact a rush to war _meta_end_dot_

 the new nie finds that iran halted its nuclear weapons program in _meta_number_ref_ and that iran can be dissuaded from pursuing a nuclear weapon through diplomacy _meta_end_dot_

 this is exactly the reason that we must avoid radical steps like the kyl lieberman bill declaring iran s revolutionary guard a terrorist organization which needlessly took us closer to war _meta_end_dot_

 and it s why i have proposed that we pursue a comprehensive diplomatic approach instead _meta_end_dot_

 typically the dig here is less subtle _meta_end_dot_

 what s more it seems appropriate _meta_end_dot_

 keep in mind that the contents of this nie have been known to the bush administration for over a year _meta_end_dot_

 under the circumstances the push for kyl lieberman and similar measures looks an awful lot like a deliberate effort to change the subject away from iran s alleged nuclear program specifically because the main actors in the administration knew their case on this point was about to collapse _meta_end_dot_

 democrats who voted for kyl lieberman look under the circumstances likes dupes at best _meta_end_dot_
