  everybody knows that barack obama was against invading iraq in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ whereas hillary clinton was for it _meta_end_dot_

 but what does that mean today and what does it mean for the future _meta_end_question_

 obama says i don t want to just end the war but i want to end the mind set that got us into war in the first place but again what does that mean _meta_end_question_

 spencer ackerman spent some time talking to obama s inner circle of foreign policy advisors trying to figure it out and came away very impressed with the obama doctrine _meta_end_dot_
