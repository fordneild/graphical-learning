  i think the talk of the clinton obama tearing the democratic party apart is a bit overstated this strikes me as the kind of thing where emotions will run high until at some point things wrap up and emotions stop running high _meta_end_dot_

 but michele goldberg raises a more reasonable micro concern that pro clinton feminist leaders open scorn for obama backing women could do real harm to feminism the irony is that for the overwhelming majority of women voting against clinton was never about repudiating second wave feminism _meta_end_dot_

 but the more leaders of the movement insist on conflating their noble struggle for social justice with the fate of an uninspiring and nepotistic candidate the less relevant it will be
