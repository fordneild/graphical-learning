  noah millman sketches out a scenario in which john mccain like ariel sharon upon being confronted with the burdens of office tempers his views in a more pragmatic direction and surprises people _meta_end_dot_

 it definitely could happen _meta_end_dot_

 heck maybe mccain could be the nixon who goes to teheran _meta_end_dot_

 but as millman says it s a fairly audacious hope given how mccain has positioned himself over the past decade and indeed while there s a general unpredictability about these things the safest assumption seems to me to be that mccain roughly believes what he s been saying all this time _meta_end_dot_

 it s not as if he s a guy with a lifelong passion for economic policy who started imitating bush s lines when he decided to run for president _meta_end_dot_

 he s in the military then he s dispatched by the military to represent their interests in congress then he s a member of congress and senator himself who s always been interested in military issues who was talking like bush before bush was talking like bush _meta_end_dot_

 in other words he s probably thought this all through and if he wins intends to govern accordingly _meta_end_dot_

 maybe not _meta_end_dot_

 we can have hope _meta_end_dot_

 but i wouldn t count on him reversing course _meta_end_dot_
