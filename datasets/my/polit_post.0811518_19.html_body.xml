  i commend this noam scheiber post from yesterday and this one line at the end got me thinking of something there are really two broad swing groups one working class the other affluent _meta_end_dot_

 in principle you could win the general by winning one or the other or some combination of the two _meta_end_dot_

 some combination indeed _meta_end_dot_

 political commentary sometimes proceeds as if we elect presidents via a demographic electoral college in which african americans are a mid sized state like wisconsin while white working class men and white working class women are respectively big states like pennsylvania and ohio _meta_end_dot_

 but of course it doesn t work that way _meta_end_dot_

 but of course it doesn t work that way _meta_end_dot_

 mccain gaining the support of _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ kerry voting vermonters doesn t accomplish anything because he s hopelessly far behind in vermont anyway _meta_end_dot_

 but persuading _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ kerry voting african americans does help him assuming they don t live in vermont even though he d still be hopelessly far behind _meta_end_dot_
