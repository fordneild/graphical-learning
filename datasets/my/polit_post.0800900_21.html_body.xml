  it s worth saying that if a month ago team obama had said their plan was to win out of the two first states and go from there i think people would have considered that a prudently optimistic plan for victory _meta_end_dot_

 the temptation to massively overreact to the last thing that happened is something i warned about during the iowa nh interregnum and the same is true today _meta_end_dot_

 in an election where most democrats think there s more than one candidate in the field who could make a good nominee i think we should expect to see a lot of volatility _meta_end_dot_
