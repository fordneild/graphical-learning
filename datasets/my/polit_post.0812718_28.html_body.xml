  arianna huffington says john mccain told her shortly after the _meta_number_ref_ election that he didn t vote for george w _meta_end_dot_

 bush mccain s camp now denies this which prompted this funny rejoinder from huffington about mccain s history of denying he did things he clearly did he denied ever talking with john kerry about his leaving the gop to be kerry s _meta_number_ref_ running mate then later admitted he had insisting everybody knows that i had a conversation he denied admitting that he didn t know much about economics even though he d said exactly that to the wall street journal _meta_end_dot_

 and the boston globe _meta_end_dot_

 and the baltimore sun _meta_end_dot_

 he denied ever having asked for a budget earmark for arizona even though he had _meta_end_dot_

 on the record _meta_end_dot_

 he denied that he d ever had a meeting with comely lobbyist vicki iseman and her client lowell paxon even though he had _meta_end_dot_

 and had admitted it in a legal deposition _meta_end_dot_

 clearly i don t know what mccain did or didn t do in the voting booth in _meta_number_ref_ but considering the position she was taking at the time it does seem like the logical thing to do would have been for mccain to support gore _meta_end_dot_

 in _meta_number_ref_ after all bush s signature initiative was a tax cut proposal that at at the time mccain opposed just like gore _meta_end_dot_

 similarly mccain s signature initiative was a campaign finance reform proposal that bush opposed but gore favored _meta_end_dot_

 on foreign policy i don t think a clear differentiation emerged between bush and gore but many construed bush s rhetoric as calling for a retrenchment of american commitments abroad at a time when mccain was calling to expand them and adopt rogue state rollback as a signature issue _meta_end_dot_

 gore s running mate was joe lieberman who s clearly someone mccain adores _meta_end_dot_

 as a career republicans you could imagine mccain deciding he couldn t possible vote for gore and just not voting but considering the issue positions and personal bitterness why would mccain have voted for bush _meta_end_question_

 the issue landscape has changed a lot in eight years with democrats generally moving left on domestic issues while mccain s moved right and seen the gop mainstream line up with his previously idiosyncratic brand of apocalyptic nationalism even as the once pressing mccain feingold issue has come to look trivial _meta_end_dot_

 but in the past mccain voting for a democrat was quite plausible after all he soon went on to discuss switching parties to discussing being kerry s vp nominee etc _meta_end_dot_
