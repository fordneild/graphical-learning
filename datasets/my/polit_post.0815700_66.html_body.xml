  one virtue of having a reputation as a straight talker is that you can get away with constant lying _meta_end_dot_

 for example in response to a question about why he twice voted against a commission to investigate the response to hurricane katrina john mccain says he voted in favor of every investigation _meta_end_dot_

 in reality just as the new orleans local news reporter said he twice voted against a commission to investigate the matter _meta_end_dot_

 now there s probably some crazy strained reading of mccain s remarks so that his claims are consistent with reality _meta_end_dot_

 and since everyone knows mccain s a straight talker the press will read it that way _meta_end_dot_

 and because that s been the press s response each of the dozens of times in the course of this campaign that mccain s told bald faced lies his reputation for straight talk never vanishes _meta_end_dot_

 a lesser figure who was in the habit of constantly lying and flip flopping would develop a reputation as a kind of madmen so invested in self love that he thinks he has no obligation to political principles or basic factual accuracy _meta_end_dot_
