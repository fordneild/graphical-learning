  paul krugman takes on the myth that the united states low population density is primarily responsible for the country s woeful broadband coverage _meta_end_dot_

 as he says there s obviously some truth to the idea that there s an objective difficulty in delivering high quality broadband to low density areas _meta_end_dot_

 but as krugman points out most americans live in fairly high density parts of the country the big empty parts are mostly empty and while they form a legitimate policy challenge they re not the essence of the matter _meta_end_dot_

 it s also worth noting that america does contain some very high density areas and it s not as if new york city is light years ahead of more typical suburbanized areas _meta_end_dot_

 what s more nyc contains considerably more people than for example denmark so it s not as if the high density portions of the states are too pathetically small in terms of market size to get the job done _meta_end_dot_

 we don t have a high quality broadband infrastructure because we haven t build a high quality broadband infrastructure much as many aspects of our infrastructure are sub par _meta_end_dot_

 and again it s not because we re incapable of undertaking ambitious logistical projects say what you will about the military bases in iraq but it s an impressive engineering and logistical enterprise we simply haven t chosen to make it a priority _meta_end_dot_
