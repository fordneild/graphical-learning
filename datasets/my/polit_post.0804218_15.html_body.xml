  i think andrew s being too much of a hater about this hillary video _meta_end_dot_

 it s pretty funny what s more if i thought it was actually the case that clinton would take action on college affordability climate change and ending the war that obama wouldn t take i would like totally be voting for her _meta_end_dot_

 but fortunately the candidates are in agreement on the first two issues and unfortunately neither of them has really committed to ending the war in iraq but obama s larger record gives me somewhat more hope that he d do the right thing _meta_end_dot_

 mostly though it serves as a reminder that i d be genuinely thrilled to vote for clinton in a general election _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 the primary dynamics breed a lot of ill will but fundamentally there are two good choices on the table here _meta_end_dot_
