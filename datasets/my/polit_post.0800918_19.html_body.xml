  a reader remarks _meta_end_dot_

 here s one prediction for a potentially game changing event on the democratic side that can come at any time and i won t venture a guess as who would ultimately benefit a gore endorsement it seems to me that were gore to endorse he would almost certainly endorse obama and that might do him some good but my sense is that gore s trying to be less and less involved in us politics _meta_end_dot_
