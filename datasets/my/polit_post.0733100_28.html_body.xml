  under the new design of the new republic s website the spine tnr editor in chief martin peretz blog on politics and culture is less visible than under the earlier design _meta_end_dot_

 as a result i haven t been reading it as much lately _meta_end_dot_

 that s too bad because i ve been missing out on batshit insane smears against liberals like this i suspect that many democrats are so deeply hostile to a forward foreign policy and their minds so deeply embedded in the notion that you can negotiate successfully with fanatics and tyrants that they wouldn t mind a prophylactic victory for the enemy _meta_end_dot_

 which raises the question is this enemy their enemy _meta_end_question_

 i suspect not _meta_end_dot_

 classy _meta_end_dot_

 i know the next time the weekly standard starts making allegations about the treasonous motives of tnr editors i ll be leaping to the barricades in their defense _meta_end_dot_

 meanwhile tnr really ought to elevate the spine s placement on their site _meta_end_dot_

 since the magazine obviously respects peretz ideas and journalism enough to give him the editor in chief title surely they should be trying to give his work as much prominence as possible and not stuffing it beneath the plank and the stump so as to suggest they re vaguely embarrassed to be associated with this sort of thing _meta_end_dot_
