  krugman writes if so the campaign has just taken a major turn in mr _meta_end_dot_

 obama s favor _meta_end_dot_

 after all if this campaign isn t dominated by faux outrage over fake scandals it will have to be about things that really did happen like a failed economic policy and a disastrous war both of which mr _meta_end_dot_

 mccain promises will continue if he wins _meta_end_dot_

 it s a good line _meta_end_dot_

 but of course if democrats are really counting on responsible substantive news coverage to hand them the election then john mccain has things in the bag _meta_end_dot_

 it s clear that the press and thus the campaign as mediated by the press will be dominated by some mix of fake scandals just as it always is and if a fake scandal requires made up facts about obama s record then the facts shall be made up _meta_end_dot_

 the question is how much does this matter _meta_end_question_

 presumably it does matter at the margin _meta_end_dot_

 and i think most of us liberals are pretty traumatized by the _meta_number_ref_ election when the press coverage was willfully horrible and things that made a difference at the margin turned out to be hugely important _meta_end_dot_

 but i find it hard to believe that in general the overall tenor of the media s coverage of silly campaign stories has a huge impact on election outcomes _meta_end_dot_

 indeed that s probably one reason why the quality is so low the stories are being produced by people who don t really think their work matters
