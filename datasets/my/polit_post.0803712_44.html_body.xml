  ryan avent comments on a great washington post article on the utter devastation the housing bust is wreaking on the phoenix area _meta_end_dot_

 all across the country prices are declining and the economy is slowing _meta_end_dot_

 but sunbelt boom towns have gotten caught up in the bubble feeback loop in a way that just doesn t seem to be true in northeastern downtowns _meta_end_dot_

 first the micro level meet the ao family they bought their first home in _meta_number_ref_ for _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 they paid for it using an option arm which allowed them to make a monthly payment of _meta_dollor_ref_ which was less than what they paid for rent in los angeles _meta_end_dot_

 only later did they realize that meant that their loan amount would grow over time not shrink as would their payments _meta_end_dot_

 when we saw the payments were so low we decided to buy another house rebekah ao said _meta_end_dot_

 with the market going crazy we figured we could sell the other house in a couple of years they now owe _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ on the first one and _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ on the new home which they are renting _meta_end_dot_

 their credit card balances which they once kept at zero have ballooned to more than _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ as they struggle to make ends meet _meta_end_dot_

 on the macro level the article notes that fully ten percent of the maricopa county labor force works in the housing sector _meta_end_dot_

 but with prices in decline there s not going to be much new residential construction until the area works through its inventory of about _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ unsold homes which could take three or four years meanwhile rather than being in a position to help out with a little juice the arizona state government is staring at a billion dollar shortfall in its _meta_dollor_ref_ billion budget and of course local government budgets are normally hit harder than state ones by declining property assessments _meta_end_dot_

 not only are most families seeing their home equity go down but families like the aos facing increased debt are going to need to cut back on spending _meta_end_dot_

 so will people who work in the building trades _meta_end_dot_

 so will some categories of public employees and public assistance recipients as the state cuts its budget _meta_end_dot_

 that means a spiraling economic downturn _meta_end_dot_

 now of course if the rest of the national economy were humming along all that excesses property might just get snapped up _meta_end_dot_

 it s a lovely part of the country with great weather a lot of people might want to move there if a housing bust made the property cheap temporarily _meta_end_dot_

 that in turn could inject some new economic activity into the area _meta_end_dot_

 but with prices on the decline everywhere it s hard to see where the new demand comes from _meta_end_dot_
