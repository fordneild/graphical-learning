  atrios wrote yesterday i would have no problem casting a vote for a _meta_number_ref_ year old person _meta_end_dot_

 it might make me look a bit more closely at who their veep is but i m just not all that concerned with the possibility that the president might get sick or die in office _meta_end_dot_

 i agree but it s worth underscoring this a bit more _meta_end_dot_

 the odds that a man in his seventies would die in office are really quite good _meta_end_dot_

 not i d take an even odds bet on john mccain dying in office good but good enough that in mccain s case the boilerplate about picking a vp who could take over and do the job needs to be taken seriously _meta_end_dot_

 that s hardly an insurmountable challenge for mccain to meet but it does at least somewhat limit his options _meta_end_dot_

 something like a dan quayle pick isn t and shouldn t going to fly _meta_end_dot_
