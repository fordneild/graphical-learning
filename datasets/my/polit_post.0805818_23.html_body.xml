  city council member phil mendelson says he s concerned that dcpd detectives are carrying too many cases police officials said that caseloads are manageable _meta_end_dot_

 most detectives who work such crimes have about _meta_number_ref_ cases at a time they said although some who work east of the anacostia river have slightly higher caseloads _meta_end_dot_

 those detectives tend to have more domestic violence cases which are often easier to close they said _meta_end_dot_

 it couldn t possibly be that people who live east of the anacostia river are much poorer and thus have less political clout and therefore enjoy inferior city serbices of all kinds right _meta_end_question_
