  i ve heard some complaints about it but i actually think the new york times s coverage of the new york times s crazy decision to add bill kristol to their stable of op ed columnists is pretty good mr _meta_end_dot_

 kristol _meta_number_ref_ has been a fierce critic of the times _meta_end_dot_

 in _meta_number_ref_ he said that the government should consider prosecuting the times for disclosing a secret government program to track international banking transactions _meta_end_dot_

 in a _meta_number_ref_ column on the turmoil within the times that led to the downfall of the top two editors he wrote that it was not a first rate newspaper of record adding the times is irredeemable i wonder what i need to say in order to get a column maybe the times s editors should be detained without trial in gitmo and tortured until they confess to deliberately running a second rate newspaper in order to undermine american resolve _meta_end_dot_

 does that work _meta_end_question_
