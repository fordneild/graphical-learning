  as we speak i m blogging from the new boltbus from dc to new york they also serve boston and philadelphia which features electrical outlets and wifi _meta_end_dot_

 naturally it s quite a bit slower than the acela but given that it s a fraction of the price of even the slower regional train it seems to me that amtrak really needs to step up its game in terms of internet access _meta_end_dot_
