  unlike me judd gregg is a u s _meta_end_dot_

 senator from the republican party so you can expect him to be relatively sympathetic to george w _meta_end_dot_

 bush s budget request for fiscal year _meta_number_ref_ dubbed managing for results _meta_end_dot_

 instead he says there s a lot of games smoke mirrors incomplete numbers basically there s not much realism in the budget senator judd gregg the top republican on the budget committee said in an interview _meta_end_dot_

 they re playing the usual games in bush s defense however it should be said that all he s doing is actually proposing what conservatives are constantly saying should be done big increases in regular military spending combined with large expenditures on the war in iraq combined with low taxes all made possible through the magic of reduced spending _meta_end_dot_

 so what did bush come up with _meta_end_question_

 well a proposal to have more americans get sick and die the proposal _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 would cut discretionary spending by the department of health and human services by more than _meta_number_ref_ percent in part by freezing the budget of the national institutes of health which heads the government s medical research efforts _meta_end_dot_

 the centers for disease control and prevention meanwhile would take a _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ percent reduction _meta_end_dot_

 the health resources and services administration which helps the poor receive medical care would be cut by _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ percent _meta_end_dot_

 depriving the population of health care and health care resources in order to make room in the budget for an indefinite military commitment to iraq and the extension of tax cuts for rich people doesn t seem like a good idea to me but apparently this is bush s strategy for long run economic growth _meta_end_dot_
