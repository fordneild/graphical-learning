  as of ten minutes ago this is what i knew about kathleen sebelius she s governor of kansas she endorsed obama she has lady parts nobody seems to have very strong objections to making her vice president _meta_end_dot_

 sam stein though offers a more thorough look _meta_end_dot_

 adding more details doesn t really change my strong strong feelings about sebelius who continues to seem like a totally plausible choice _meta_end_dot_
