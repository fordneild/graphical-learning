  i m increasingly seeing arguments that the real importance of the colombia trade deal is political rather than economic _meta_end_dot_

 colombia has made important strides over the past several years and the colombian government is our proxy of choice in south america enmeshed in conflict with guerillas backed by hugo chavez _meta_end_dot_

 but there are two ways to read the security trade linkage here _meta_end_dot_

 one would be that this deal is a favor to the colombian government that we should do to bolster them _meta_end_dot_

 another would be that this deal is a favor to the u s _meta_end_dot_

 business enterprises who run the bush administration that the colombian government has agreed to in order to retain the support of the american security apparatus for their counterinsurgency _meta_end_dot_

 interpretation one is getting all the press but if you read the agreement the colombians seems to be making almost all the policy changes suggesting interpretation two _meta_end_dot_

 what s more though interpretation one is certainly the more high minded argument to make in your magazine blog post or congressional speech argument two seems if true more convincing on the merits _meta_end_dot_
