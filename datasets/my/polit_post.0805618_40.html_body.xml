  i find this new john mccain take on his remarks about staying in iraq for _meta_number_ref_ years pretty confusing _meta_end_dot_

 formerly we weren t supposed to worry about his commitment to a war of indefinite duration because you see the _meta_number_ref_ years was tacked on with the proviso that no americans would be killed _meta_end_dot_

 how this kind of open ended commitment was supposed to get us to that zero casualty point was unclear _meta_end_dot_

 but now we learn that the war for all intents and purposes although the insurgency will go on for years and years and years but it will be handled by the iraqis not by us and then we decide what kind of security arrangement we want to have with the iraqis this to me is baffling _meta_end_dot_

 if the insurgency is still going on for years and years and years then either the insurgency is taking place but u s _meta_end_dot_

 troops have left iraq which mccain opposes or else the war is continuing _meta_end_dot_

 i guess the mccain alternative is that the insurgency keeps fighting and our troops stay in iraq but the insurgents forget we re there and generously decide not to attack us _meta_end_dot_

 or something _meta_end_dot_
