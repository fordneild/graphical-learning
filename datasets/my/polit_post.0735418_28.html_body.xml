  well for me it s a simple question i agree with him about very little _meta_end_dot_

 indeed even though i agree with him about the war in iraq i don t actually agree with his broad vision of foreign policy _meta_end_dot_

 there s just very little there to like _meta_end_dot_

 but for megan things are different ron paul has some beliefs that i like such as his opposition to eminent domain abuse _meta_end_dot_

 but he also has a number of beliefs that are not to put too fine a point on it utterly insane _meta_end_dot_

 the gold standard is one the belief that nafta is a trojan horse for the north american union is another _meta_end_dot_

 much of his persona sincere or not seems to boil down to foreigners are scary and people who like foreigners are plotting to take away all your stuff these seem like worries to have once it becomes reasonable to think that ron paul might become president _meta_end_dot_

 that s not the case right now _meta_end_dot_

 if you re as dyspeptic about both political parties as megan claims to be it seems to me that a protest vote for ron paul on a libertarian party line would be the best thing to do _meta_end_dot_

 the reason libertarians don t like either political party is that nobody feels like catering to a fringe ideology with almost no supporters _meta_end_dot_

 david boaz and david kirby claim there s a large libertarian vote but the proof would be in the pudding _meta_end_dot_

 paul s not going to be president so one doesn t need to worry about whether or not he d be a good president _meta_end_dot_

 the question is whether or not there s any constituency for a platform of massively rolling back the government s activities both at home and abroad votes for paul will prove its existence if it s out there and then major parties featuring plausible political leaders will move in that direction _meta_end_dot_
