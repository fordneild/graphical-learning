  i was a bit surprised to see jonathan zasloff recommend this pearl of wisdom from roger simon who would you like to be in the white house if pakistan fell to al qaeda and the islamists gained control of its nuclear arsenal _meta_end_question_

 answer that question and you will know your candidate _meta_end_dot_

 all the rest as they say is commentary _meta_end_dot_

 one issue here is that this is a pretty outlandish hypothetical _meta_end_dot_

 the odds of the pakistani government collapsing and al qaeda taking over are low _meta_end_dot_

 but more to the point much more than a president who ll respond effectively when al qaeda seizes control of a nuclear arsenal you want a president who ll make it unlikely that al qaeda seizes a nuclear arsenal _meta_end_dot_

 there s an unfortunately tendency to look at crisis response as the essence of statesmanship when in reality it s avoiding crises that is most important _meta_end_dot_

 i think for example that george h w _meta_end_dot_

 bush did the right thing in prosecuting the first gulf war and indeed that he did a good job of waging the war _meta_end_dot_

 but an even better president might have been able ot avoid the whole thing in the first place by dissuading saddam from invading kuwait _meta_end_dot_

 my hope in short isn t that the next president will be better than bush at reacting than disaster strikes but that he or more likely she will be better than bush at forestalling disaster _meta_end_dot_
