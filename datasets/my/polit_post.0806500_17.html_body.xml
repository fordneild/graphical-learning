  according to msnbc exit polls it seems to have put hillary clinton over the top _meta_end_dot_

 relatedly i don t understand why they re not calling ohio for clinton _meta_end_dot_

 the exit polls look unambiguous to me she s won it _meta_end_dot_

 obama made up a lot of ground over the past two weeks but she won the state and all that s left to do is figure out the delegate count _meta_end_dot_
