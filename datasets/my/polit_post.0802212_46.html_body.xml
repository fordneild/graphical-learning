  commenter ryan sums up my feelings about the debate based on the clips i saw it s really strange _meta_end_dot_

 each time hillary really goes for the jugular fairly or unfairly i am repulsed _meta_end_dot_

 and then _meta_number_ref_ seconds later i realize that that s the whole rationale for her candidacy _meta_end_exclamation_

 she and bill will simply do whatever it takes to win _meta_end_dot_

 and she s really whip smart and was quicker than obama in this debate _meta_end_dot_

 i think it will come down to whoever the media spins as the winner of the early flare up otherwise another draw _meta_end_dot_

 it s an uncomfortable truth but there you have it the very tendentiousness of some of her attacks on barack obama is sort of the point _meta_end_dot_

 those of us who remember florida _meta_number_ref_ from the butterfly ballot to the bourgeois riot to the rigged supreme court ruling appreciate that the other side plays to win and there s no real honor in letting the country fall under a spell of catastrophic malgovernance _meta_end_dot_

 but still if voters are considering being persuaded by the merits of clinton s arguments about obama and the war or about the present votes or whatever else they ought to be aware that this is all basically bogus _meta_end_dot_

 what s more i think it s worth pointing out that clinton seems to have gotten herself firmly into flip flop territory on the war at this point hawk was bad substantively and politically but this may be worse _meta_end_dot_
