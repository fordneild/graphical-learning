  use of airstrikes way up in iraq _meta_end_dot_

 colin kahl forecasts even more in the future part of this is announcing our presence to the adversary said kahl who recently returned from a trip to the air operations center _meta_end_dot_

 across this calendar year you will see a reduction in u s _meta_end_dot_

 forces so there will be fewer troops to support iraqi forces _meta_end_dot_

 one would expect a continued level of airstrikes because of offensive operations and as u s _meta_end_dot_

 forces begin to draw down you may see even more airstrikes increased reliance on firepower as a substitute for adequate manpower strikes me as a classic coin no no but kahl seems to approve and even told usa today last week that due to increased carefulness the civil toll is being reduced you saw a lot more damage to the civilian population in _meta_number_ref_ than you re seeing now _meta_end_dot_

 even though you have a huge uptick in offensive operations it looks like the military is taking greater care not to harm civilians obviously i hope that s right _meta_end_dot_

 it s my understanding however that the defense department still doesn t count civilian casualties so i don t really understand how they would know whether or not you re seeing a reduction in damage to the civilian population _meta_end_dot_

 in my book the first step in taking greater care to avoid something is to measure what s happening _meta_end_dot_
