  it s not really much of a surprise at this point that paul krugman deemed barack obama s economy speech inadequate but it is worth pointing out that krugman s take on this is a little idiosyncratic within the larger world of liberal economics specialists _meta_end_dot_

 the speech i read was definitely a critique from the left of the clinton administration record accusing them of going too far in joining with the gop to gut the regulatory apparatus that s necessary to make american capitalism work _meta_end_dot_

 which is all by way of throat clearing to introduce bob kuttner s column on the subject bob was a populist before it was cool and hasn t been hesitant to slam obama in the past but he loved the speech _meta_end_dot_

 update jared bernstein also stepsto obama s defense _meta_end_dot_
