  kay amnesty international released their report on human rights abuses and it has a pretty scathing take on the united states _meta_end_dot_

 one of the top abuses they list are indefinite detentions at guantanamo bay the imprisonment of conscientious objector soldiers and the coercive interrogation policies in place _meta_end_dot_

 it s not really surprising that the united states would be subject to scrutiny by ai given the controversial nature of these practices domestically _meta_end_dot_

 although there s a pretty strong argument to be made against cos in a volunteer military unless that person enlisted before the united states was at war ai s report is a reminder of how the bush administration s policies on war and torture damage the credibility of the united states when decrying other countries for humanitarian abuses _meta_end_dot_

 what the bush administration has essentially done is used the second tier excuse of human rights abuses to invade iraq then piled on to the laundry list of human rights violations in the world with his own policies on torture and indefinite detention _meta_end_dot_

 the record on human rights had damaged the credibility of legitimate work americans want to conduct on human rights abuses in the future even given a new administration that is presumably less comfortable with torture _meta_end_dot_

 other practices by the united states in the report included were failure by the government to properly address sexual violence against native american women the criminal justice system that includes a death penalty and victims of hurricanes katrina and rita who still lack access to housing _meta_end_dot_
