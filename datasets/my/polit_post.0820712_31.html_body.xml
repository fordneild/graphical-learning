  here s ken pollack explaining that if you count wrong then mccain and obama have similar positions on iraq well i actually think his timeline obama s timeline even mccain s timeline are actually pretty close _meta_end_dot_

 now that s what you ve seen over the last _meta_number_ref_ months that we re now really debating months maybe years but really just months _meta_end_dot_

 mr _meta_end_dot_

 mccain is basically saying he ll start some kind of a drawdown in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 mr _meta_end_dot_

 obama is saying it d be more like _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 and what maliki seems to be saying is _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ somewhere in the middle _meta_end_dot_

 for one thing it s just flat out wrong to say that maliki is talking about a drawdown starting in _meta_number_ref_ or _meta_number_ref_ he said he wanted a timeline whose endpoint is somewhere in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 but more to the point pollack s counting the wrong thing _meta_end_dot_

 sure if you go from when different people say they want to start reducing troop levels there s not so much disagreement _meta_end_dot_

 but the most important part about these timetables is when they end _meta_end_dot_

 obama s timetable ends in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 maliki s timetable ends in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 mccain s timetable by contrast ends _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 never _meta_end_dot_
