  it s probably not my place to judge but of all things for conservatives to distrust about john mccain surely this gang of fourteen business is the silliest _meta_end_dot_

 this was a disagreement over tactics not any grand questions of principle _meta_end_dot_

 there s never been any indication that mccain doesn t favor conservative judicial nominees _meta_end_dot_

 indeed the upshot of the compromise mccain helped broker was the confirmation of a bunch of conservative judges _meta_end_dot_

 it seems to me that mccain s tactics were pretty smart and effective _meta_end_dot_

 but even if you disagree and think his tactical judgment was wrong it was just that a question of tactics _meta_end_dot_
