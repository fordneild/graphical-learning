  went to last night s thrilling triumph over cleveland and i have to say that when i saw gilbert arenas limp off the court my hope in the absence of any television commentary to tell me exactly what was happening was that he d be too hurt to get back in the game _meta_end_dot_

 the team isn t better without arenas per se but it s hard to avoid the conclusion that the team plays with more intensity on the defensive end without him _meta_end_dot_

 that s not merely or even especially a reflection of arenas defensive skills or lack thereof it s broader and more systemic a switch seems to go on that says oh no gilbert s not around we ll only win if we play defense which in the end leads to more success over all _meta_end_dot_
