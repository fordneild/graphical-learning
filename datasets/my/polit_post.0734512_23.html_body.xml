  it s difficult to know how to maintain one s sense of outrage these days _meta_end_dot_

 am i surprised to learn that the house govern reform committee says that its _meta_number_ref_ month investigation reveals a systematic white house effort to censor climate scientists by controlling their access to the press and editing testimony to congress well no i m not surprised _meta_end_dot_

 so am i shocked by the revelation _meta_end_question_

 i guess i m not _meta_end_dot_

 but is it shocking that this sort of thing has become par for the course _meta_end_question_

 well yes it is _meta_end_dot_

 after all this isn t some trivial little thing being kept under the rug it s probably the most important issue facing the country _meta_end_dot_
