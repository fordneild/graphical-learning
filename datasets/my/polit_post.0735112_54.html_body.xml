  dave roberts is annoyed to see the press portraying the democrat s decision to push for an energy bill that was good on the merits and supported by a majority of members of the house and a majority of members of the senate as a misstep because it wasn t sufficiently watered down to overcome the opposition of a minority of senators _meta_end_dot_

 i m more accustomed to hearing the generic form of this complaint but it is true that there s something very odd about this washington tick of celebrating legislating as such as if the job of public officials was to pass new laws and their success or failure should simply be judged by the quantity of stuff they did _meta_end_dot_

 this reflects political reports preference for remaining ignorant of policy matters but it doesn t make any sense as a point of view _meta_end_dot_
