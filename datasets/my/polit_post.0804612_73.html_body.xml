  for a more substantive take on the whole fisa telecom immunity issue than i ve been able to muster check out my friend libertarian tech policy analyst tim lee s slate article from a few days ago which runs down most of the relevant information _meta_end_dot_

 it is however worth dwelling here a bit on the precedent _meta_end_dot_

 if the executive branch comes to a private company and asks it to do something illegal the executive branch has powerful ways of making the company see things its way _meta_end_dot_

 being on the good side of the incumbent administration is a good place to be _meta_end_dot_

 but still companies will think twice about cooperating with illegal requests if they re sure that doing so will come around and bite them in the ass in the long run _meta_end_dot_

 but if you create the situation the bush administration is proposing where failure to comply with illegal requests has negative consequences but agreeing to comply with illegal requests lets you off scot free then no company going forward is going to have any reason to refuse to comply with any sort of illegal requests _meta_end_dot_

 in essence the immunity provision would gut whatever other restrictions the new fisa law might contain _meta_end_dot_

 meanwhile it s good to see steny hoyer standing tall now the president asserts that the expiration of the protect america act will pose a danger to our country _meta_end_dot_

 the former national security council advisor on terrorism says that s not true _meta_end_dot_

 former assistant attorney general says that s not true _meta_end_dot_

 numerous others and the chairman has asserted that s not true _meta_end_dot_

 why is that not true _meta_end_question_

 because fisa will remain in effect _meta_end_dot_

 the authority given under the protect america act remains in effect _meta_end_dot_

 and if there are new targets the fisa court has full authority to give every authority to the administration to act _meta_end_dot_

 so i tell my friends we are pursuing the politics of fear _meta_end_dot_

 unfounded fear _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ members of this house and every one of us every one of us wants to keep america and americans safe _meta_end_dot_

 not one of us not one of us wants to subject america or americans to danger _meta_end_dot_

 the president s assertion is wrong _meta_end_dot_

 i say it categorically _meta_end_dot_

 the president s assertion is wrong _meta_end_dot_

 as i argue in heads in the sand it s important to approach these things from a self confident point of view rather than a defensive one _meta_end_dot_

 when bush says something outrageous you have to act like you re outraged not like you re frightened that his outrageous statements will cause the voters to punish you _meta_end_dot_

 confidence alone obviously isn t nearly enough to win political fights but it is a necessary precondition of doing so _meta_end_dot_
