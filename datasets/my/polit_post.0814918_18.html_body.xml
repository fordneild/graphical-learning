  ta nehisi i really said i was going to stop talking about this _meta_end_dot_

 but i just read through the convo over at tnr between amanda fortini and michelle cottle as well as isaac s response and i just want to throw in a couple notes _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ picking up on isaac s great point about excitement over a woman black president i think so much of this has to do with the candidate themselves _meta_end_dot_

 this whole notion of masses of people excited about a black president in particular ignores the fact that since _meta_number_ref_ we ve had a black person at least declare for president every year _meta_end_dot_

 in _meta_number_ref_ we had two a black man and a black woman _meta_end_dot_

 i don t recall there being much excitement around the notion of president al sharpton amongst blacks or whites _meta_end_dot_

 it s true that there is a great deal of excitement now about electing a black president but that s because the prospect is barack obama _meta_end_dot_

 ditto for hillary _meta_end_dot_

 this sort of reductionist thinking that focuses only on her gender independent of much more mundane factors like ignoring caucus states is myopic _meta_end_dot_

 it misses and greatly diminishes the power of the individual _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ if there is one thing that all this gender race analysis has taught it s this simple lesson there are no black _meta_end_dot_

 women _meta_end_dot_

 anywhere _meta_end_dot_

 ever _meta_end_dot_

 there s been great handwringing over an alleged schism between younger and older feminists _meta_end_dot_

 but if that s a schism i don t know what you call the chasm between black and white feminists _meta_end_dot_

 we all are very interested in how the campaign would have unfolded if barack obama had been a woman _meta_end_dot_

 but we could care less how it would have unfolded if hillary had been black mostly because the answer is much simpler there would have been no campaign to begin with _meta_end_dot_

 she would most likely be hooked up with a black dude and thus likely would never have been first lady of arkansas much less of the united states and much less a senator from new york _meta_end_dot_

 an inability to even consider other worlds explains why every time i see some writer attempting to assess the interplay of race and gender it s rarely someone who actually has to you know deal with race and gender _meta_end_dot_

 that of course includes yours truly _meta_end_dot_
