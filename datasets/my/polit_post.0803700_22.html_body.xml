  obviously mccain s going to win tonight _meta_end_dot_

 it s striking though to see mccain even winning in places like georgia where he only draws _meta_number_ref_ percent of the vote _meta_end_dot_

 in short even where anti mccain sentiment runs strong it doesn t run nearly strong enough to unite people behind mitt romney _meta_end_dot_

 update sorry brain fart _meta_end_dot_

 georgia hasn t been called _meta_end_dot_

 i was looking at some random interim figures _meta_end_dot_
