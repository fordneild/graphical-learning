  like robert farley i m not sure whether to believe these tales of super strength from the german press he goes and picks up a pair of _meta_number_ref_ kilo weights and starts curling them with his left and right arms _meta_number_ref_ repetitions on each side _meta_end_dot_

 then amazingly he picks up the _meta_number_ref_ kilo weights _meta_end_exclamation_

 very slowly he lifts them first _meta_number_ref_ curls with his right then _meta_number_ref_ with his left _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ kilos is about _meta_number_ref_ pounds _meta_end_dot_
