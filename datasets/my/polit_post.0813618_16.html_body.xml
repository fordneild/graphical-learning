  california supreme court overturns gay marriage ban _meta_end_dot_

 this will presumably create political headaches for liberals john mccain will be able to argue with some plausibility that judges appointed by barack obama are likely to make similar rulings not that there s anything wrong with that but the voters may feel otherwise but it s a victory for justice _meta_end_dot_

 the smart set thing to do at this point is i assume to argue that this is a good outcome but the process is bad _meta_end_dot_

 realistically though the courts that rule in this direction are doing their jobs _meta_end_dot_

 i think there s good reason to think that america s system of very strong judicial review is a mistake and there should be some kind of override process as in canada but judges are supposed to rule under the system we have _meta_end_dot_

 update of course state court rulings can be overridden with amendments to the state constitution which in california and most other places isn t all that difficult _meta_end_dot_

 the problem arises at the federal level where it s preposterously difficult to pass a constitutional amendment _meta_end_dot_
