  there s a bunch of progressive groups experimenting with some interesting iraq recession messaging which sounds promising to me but as paul krugman explains doesn t fit the facts particularly well the fact is that war is in general expansionary for the economy at least in the short run _meta_end_dot_

 world war ii remember ended the great depression _meta_end_dot_

 the _meta_dollor_ref_ billion or so we re spending each month in iraq mainly goes to us produced goods and services which means that the war is actually supporting demand _meta_end_dot_

 yes there would be infinitely better ways to spend the money _meta_end_dot_

 but at a time when a shortfall of demand is the problem the iraq war nonetheless acts as a sort of wpa supporting employment directly and indirectly _meta_end_dot_

 krugman mentions the war s impact on the price of oil as one potential caveat _meta_end_dot_

 i would also add that the war s been going on long enough at this point that we re feeling some of the long term consequences of war related spending along with the short term ones _meta_end_dot_

 americans are probably somewhat poorer on average than we would be had the war never been fought _meta_end_dot_

 but the war s not responsible for the economic slowdown in the short term it s helping to prop the economy up _meta_end_dot_

 indeed the dc area in particular though also i would note arizona though obviously saint john s hawkish views reflect pure straight talky principle and owe nothing to the large number of defense contractors he represents has seen a lot of defense fueled growth _meta_end_dot_
