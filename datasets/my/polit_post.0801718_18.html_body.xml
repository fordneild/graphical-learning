  via tyler cowen daniel rees college football games and crime _meta_end_dot_

 the main finding is that college football leads to crime for instance assaults increase by about _meta_percent_ref_ when a community hosts a college football game vandalism increases by about _meta_percent_ref_ and duis increase by about _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 we also find evidence that upsets result in larger increases in crime than games that do not produce an upset _meta_end_dot_

 for instance an upset loss at home is associated with a _meta_percent_ref_ increase in assaults and a _meta_percent_ref_ increase in vandalism _meta_end_dot_

 we discuss these results in the context of psychological theories of fan aggression _meta_end_dot_

 strange but it seems true _meta_end_dot_
