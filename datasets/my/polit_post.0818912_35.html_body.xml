  megan mcardle based on a talk by stephen carter comes to the view that that when americans say someone should do something to stop a conflict somewhere this is almost tantamount to saying we should do something because at a most generous estimate there are four military forces in the world capable of deploying into a conflict zone and shutting down the war america britain australia and israel _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 when we decide not to intervene we are making a decision that no one should act to halt the conflict there s some truth to that but i think the perspective needs some nuance _meta_end_dot_

 it s true that very few countries can acting alone intervene in meaningful ways in civil conflicts _meta_end_dot_

 but that s not to say that those countries can t contribute constructively to military undertakings _meta_end_dot_

 it s to say that they can only contribute helpfully if the united states is also contributing and is thus able to help out with some of the logistical elements and or perhaps do the pointiest fighting _meta_end_dot_

 but as we re seeing right now in iraq even the enormous us military establishment faces meaningful manpower constraints relative to the task of stabilizing medium sized areas so when you re thinking about the feasibility of doing something or other whether or not other countries are pitching in makes a real difference _meta_end_dot_

 then beyond that there s the question of politics _meta_end_dot_

 the african union doesn t have a ton of military heft behind it _meta_end_dot_

 but there s a huge difference in terms of politics and legitimacy between an operation in africa led by a western power and supported by au member states operating joint blessings from the au and the un security council and an operation in africa where a western power unilaterally intervenes _meta_end_dot_

 last whenever people make these capacities based arguments you do need to ask as a followup whether this just happens to be an argument they re wielding on behalf of a policy of aggressive unilateralism or whether they re also trying to advocate for steps to ameliorate the capabilities issue _meta_end_dot_

 should there be a un standing force _meta_end_question_

 i think perhaps there should _meta_end_dot_

 was the center for american progress correct to recommend that the _meta_number_ref_ qdr involve helping the african union to build capacity to solve regional con icts thus reducing the need to deploy u s _meta_end_dot_

 forces _meta_end_question_

 i think they were _meta_end_dot_
