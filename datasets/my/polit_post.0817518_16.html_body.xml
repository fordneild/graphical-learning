  i briefly argued on saturday that public policy bias in favor of homeownership was perhaps a not very good idea _meta_end_dot_

 paul krugman lays out the argument at greater length today _meta_end_dot_

 clive crook did an even longer column on this for the atlantic several months ago _meta_end_dot_

 crook and krugman are not particularly close to each other ideologically an indication that this aspect of our policy environment is not motivated by any particularly principled considerations _meta_end_dot_

 let me just add to this that if you look at homeownership rate by state it s clear that a super high rate of homeownership is neither a sign of economic vitality nor something that creates economic vitality _meta_end_dot_
