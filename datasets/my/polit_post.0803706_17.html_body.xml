  i m not sure i really buy john judis argument here _meta_end_dot_

 first he observes hillary clinton won the big states she had to win and arrested barack obama s momentum but she is going to have problems with white male voters _meta_end_dot_

 obama is having trouble with white working class voters and latinos _meta_end_dot_

 then he goes on to extend this analysis to the general election arguing that both clinton and obama have critical weaknesses _meta_end_dot_

 the trouble here is that judis method is going to reach the conclusion party x is doomed any time party x has two fairly equally matched contenders _meta_end_dot_

 even if the two contenders are both very strong each is going to look weak among whichever groups of voters prefer the other candidate _meta_end_dot_

 conversely if there are two very weak contenders then they re both going to look strong within the demographic groups where their rival is especially weak _meta_end_dot_

 to me most indications are that the democrats have two strong contenders _meta_end_dot_

 consider that in missouri about _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ people came out to vote in the gop primary a primary that all three candidates seriously contested _meta_end_dot_

 by contrast _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ people came to vote on the democratic side _meta_end_dot_

 if you put all five candidates into a single election hillary clinton s second place showing of _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ would have trounced john mccain s _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ for third place _meta_end_dot_

 both candidates in short are good at appealing to large numbers of voters and getting them to show up _meta_end_dot_
