  dana goldstein notes the collapse of hillary clinton s argument that she played some kind of key role in passing the family and medical leave act seriously though a bigger story supposedly uncovered in the first lady papers is that hillary never held or attended any meetings on the family medical leave act which was the first piece of legislation president bill clinton signed _meta_number_ref_ days after entering office _meta_end_dot_

 having just written a piece about the fmla for the upcoming print issue of the prospect i can tell you that anyone familiar with the law should have already realized hillary s very limited involvement _meta_end_dot_

 the non profit organization the national partnership for women and families originally drafted the bill which was then championed in the house by former colorado congresswoman pat schroeder and in the senate by chris dodd and ted kennedy _meta_end_dot_

 these three were at work trying to pass the fmla from the late _meta_number_ref_s on while the clintons were in arkansas and running a national campaign _meta_end_dot_

 beyond that my understanding is that the law actually passed before bill clinton was elected the bill reached its final form in _meta_number_ref_ passing both houses of congress only to be vetoed by bush who said the bill would tie the hands of businesses _meta_end_dot_

 an attempt to override the veto failed but congress re introduced and passed the bin without any major changes in _meta_number_ref_ at the height of the presidential campaign knowing bush would veto the bill again and leave himself open to charges that he was anti family when clinton won the law passed again and he signed it _meta_end_dot_

 given that history it s just inconceivable that hillary could have played a large role _meta_end_dot_

 ezra klein wonders if ted kennedy and chris dodd are supporting barack obama in part out of spite because they don t like clinton claiming credit for their legislative achievements _meta_end_dot_

 i don t think you need spite to factor into it the essence of the case for hillary according to hillary is her experience so of course people in a position ot know how tenuous her claims to experience are don t find the case for hillary all that compelling _meta_end_dot_
