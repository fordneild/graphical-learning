  given that there s no democratic primary in michigan and michigan has an open primary kos offers the devilish suggestions that democrats and democrat friendly independents should turn out and vote for mitt romney who seems like a much easier general election opponent in november _meta_end_dot_

 i ll only note that there s no reason one need be so cynical about it _meta_end_dot_

 i would much rather live under president clinton or president obama than under president romney but i d take president romney over president mccain or president huckabee _meta_end_dot_

 romney s a pathetic liar and he s running on a shitty agenda but in a pinch you can say that the man has a track record of managerial competence that huckabee and mccain distinctly lack _meta_end_dot_

 meanwhile romney appears not to quite have either mccain s zeal for war or huckabee s zeal for not knowing what he s talking about _meta_end_dot_

 so there s really no downside to going and casting a ballot for romney _meta_end_dot_
