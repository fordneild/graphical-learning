  as the pressure builds on war critics to acknowledge the progress that s been made in iraq i imagine we ll see a few more reports like this one from the new york times with american military successes outpacing political gains in iraq the bush administration has lowered its expectation of quickly achieving major steps toward unifying the country including passage of a long stymied plan to share oil revenues and holding regional elections _meta_end_dot_

 it s worth noting how fundamentally illogical the idea of military successes outpacing political gains is _meta_end_dot_

 the military is a branch of the american government _meta_end_dot_

 the government is run by politicians and political appointees _meta_end_dot_

 they frame objectives and policies designed to achieve those objectives _meta_end_dot_

 subsidiary branches of the government then either do or don t made progress toward achieving those objectives _meta_end_dot_

 the stated goals of invading iraq were to eliminate its nuclear weapons program which failed because there was no such program and to turn it into a shining beacon of democracy to inspire reformers throughout the region which also failed since iraq has instead become a scare story autocrats use to keep elites and middle class types unified behind the regime _meta_end_dot_

 after several years of failure a new military initiative was announced the surge and it s goal was to create an improvement in the security situation in baghdad which it was hypothesized was the necessary precondition for a political resolution to iraq s fundamental conflicts _meta_end_dot_

 the surge was tried and american casualties went up and violence stayed at the same level and then violence declined and then us casualties decline and then it turned out that the surge had failed and the political situation was the same as it had been at the beginning _meta_end_dot_

 and yet despite this failure there are lots of happy faces in washington _meta_end_dot_

 why _meta_end_question_

 well it s not because despite the lack of political progress we ve seen plenty of military progress rather it s because the surge helped achieve plenty of political objectives just not the stated ones of the mission _meta_end_dot_

 it has for example caused democratic party elected officials to grow more timid in their rhetoric which makes republicans happy and also signals good news for democratic party hawks in their struggles with democratic party doves _meta_end_dot_

 what s more insofar as one of the primary unstated political goals of the war has simply been to create a never ending american military presence in iraq the surge has generated substantial progress toward that goal _meta_end_dot_

 the american political system seems to operate as if spending on defense related ventures doesn t come at a real cost _meta_end_dot_

 propose a new domestic spending initiative and people want to hear about your offsets _meta_end_dot_

 if you don t have offsets you need new taxes _meta_end_dot_

 and you can t raise taxes _meta_end_dot_

 if you want to cut taxes you can probably get away with it but you ll face at least some political resistance _meta_end_dot_

 defense spending though doesn t count it s completely shielded from scrutiny and we think nothing of tossing _meta_dollor_ref_ billion here and _meta_dollor_ref_ billion there until the end of time _meta_end_dot_

 thus if some gambit succeeds in making american casualty rates decline something like democrat shawn brimley s proposal that the next president consider plateauing at a certain level at some future point in order to continue counter terrorism and or an advising mission becomes much more viable _meta_end_dot_

 in late _meta_number_ref_ and throughout _meta_number_ref_ it looked like we had a situation where the american mission in iraq was going to become untenable _meta_end_dot_

 in early _meta_number_ref_ we were promised a surge whose purpose was to make the american mission in iraq unnecessary _meta_end_dot_

 it was going to create a security environment conducive to the creation of a political settlement thus allowing for the withdrawal of american troops _meta_end_dot_

 it didn t happen _meta_end_dot_

 and it s not clear that anyone ever believed it would happen _meta_end_dot_

 instead it s created a situation where it now once again looks as it did in _meta_number_ref_ and _meta_number_ref_ that we might be able to stay in iraq forever _meta_end_dot_

 and of course if you don t consider financial costs to be costs and don t consider small numbers of casualties to be costs and don t believe in opportunity costs and try not to worry to much about the risk of war with iran and don t mind the lack of benefits except to the egos of the war s supporters then this looks like a pretty smart policy _meta_end_dot_

 and though i think its advocates are underestimating the odds that even their goalpost shifting will fail i ll concede at least that it very much might work _meta_end_dot_
