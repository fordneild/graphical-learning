  one issue that comes up now and again is whether a player is likely to shoot more efficiently if he plays alongside other good players _meta_end_dot_

 intuitively the answer is yes if you need to carry the offense single handedly the defense can collapse around you and it s hard to score _meta_end_dot_

 if you play alongside other stars by contrast the defense is spread out and you can get easy shots _meta_end_dot_

 but just because it sounds reasonable doesn t make it true _meta_end_dot_

 some evidence is suggested by the above chart of the celtics new big three kevin garnett paul pierce and ray allen all of whom shifted from being the clear focal point of an offense to forming one leg of a more evenly balanced offensive stool _meta_end_dot_

 as we can see all three saw their shooting efficiency take a tumble last season and now they re doing better _meta_end_dot_

 even more strikingly all three are putting up career high numbers in true shooting percentage thus far this season _meta_end_dot_

 that s not definitive proof that they re scoring more efficiently because they re scoring together but it s suggestive _meta_end_dot_

 certainly it ll be interesting to see if that trend holds up over the course of the season _meta_end_dot_

 another good case to look at would be carmelo anthony and allen iverson _meta_end_dot_
