  last night i decided i should finally come to terms with the reality that _meta_number_ref_ percent of the people i know in nyc live in brooklyn at this point so off i went to a bar where at least at a somewhat unfashionably early hour they decided that playing hole s live through this in its entirety would be a good idea at any rate while this was going on it occurred to me that too much time spent in the mid _meta_number_ref_s listening to modern rock radio and watching mtv had utterly burned violet and doll parts deep deep deep into my brain that the rest of the album was totally unfamiliar _meta_end_dot_

 the non single tracks have a less produced more riot grrl y flavor _meta_end_dot_

 all of which seems like as good a time as any to link to the melissa auf der maur blog _meta_end_dot_
