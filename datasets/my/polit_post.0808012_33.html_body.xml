  the column definitely has a more in sorrow than in anger tone to it but it seems that john mccain s iraq antics have lost david broder who apparently was expecting mccain to indicate that there was some level of iraqi political dysfunction he wouldn t be prepared to tolerate as president _meta_end_dot_

 in the real world though if your goal is an enduring american military presence in iraq you need political dysfunction _meta_end_dot_

 if iraq were to emerge as a stable country with a government responsive to its citizens wishes they d tell the americans to take a hike _meta_end_dot_

 its sectarian tensions and instability that make the continued unpopular presence of a huge number of american boots on the ground viable _meta_end_dot_
