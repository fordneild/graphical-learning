  my read of the pre results spinning is that both sides seem to be anticipating a clinton win in the high one digits _meta_end_dot_

 if true that ll mean a continuation of the status quo clinton hopelessly behind and yet no particular reason except the good of the party for her not to stay in the race and hope obama dies in a freak accident or something _meta_end_dot_
