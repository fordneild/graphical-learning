  i m going to put on my grumpy think like an economist cap and say that while adrian fenty s decision to move dc toward a meter system is excellent his move to lower fares may not be _meta_end_dot_

 lower fares means after all less supply it s not as if fenty s going to acquire a vast army of slave cabdrivers to shuttle us around the city at low low rates _meta_end_dot_

 difficulty finding a free cab when you want one is a cost too so i d want to see some kind of estimate of the impact before i immediately laud the move _meta_end_dot_
