  clinton takes the nation s littlest state _meta_end_dot_

 i m a bit surprised by how narrow the margin was since my sense of rhode island is that it s like massachusetts only with a somewhat less obama friendly demographic _meta_end_dot_

 maybe ma meets ct would be more accurate though which would jibe with the results _meta_end_dot_
