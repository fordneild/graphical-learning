  one anti obama meme that i notice has gotten a lot of support even among people sympathetic to his cause is the notion that he s somehow shallow or insufficiently well versed in policy matters _meta_end_dot_

 obviously i can t crawl into either candidate s brain and take a look around but this idea doesn t seem to me to be especially well supported by the evidence _meta_end_dot_

 instead it seems to draw support from a kind of implicit law of conservation of virtues the pretty girl can t be smart the not so good looking guy must be really nice that has people notice that clinton is well versed in policy but isn t a charismatic figure and obama is charismatic so it must be that he s not well versed in policy _meta_end_dot_

 he s cool and she s the nerd _meta_end_dot_

 this suits the media s taste for parallels and lazy narratives into which events can be squeezed _meta_end_dot_

 but there s really not much basis for it _meta_end_dot_

 for one thing these takes tend to have a certain vague quality to them and often are offered by people who don t themselves have a particular aptitude for policy _meta_end_dot_

 i ve never heard an anecdote that involved someone talking to obama about some policy question and walking away feeling he had a notably poor grasp of the issue _meta_end_dot_

 those things do happen though _meta_end_dot_

 i definitely had a conversation with a then senator about iraq in _meta_number_ref_ in which i got the impression that though the senator was working earnestly to inform himself about the issue his actual knowledge base was shockingly low considering how long the war had been going on _meta_end_dot_

 but with obama _meta_end_question_

 i haven t heard about it _meta_end_dot_

 meanwhile this story is one of several narratives that seems to me to overlook his time in the illinois state senate _meta_end_dot_

 obama didn t have some vast army of staffers to rely on in that role and he wasn t just serving time there either _meta_end_dot_

 he successfully authored and passed legislation and impressed a lot of illinois progressives _meta_end_dot_

 nor is the university of chicago law school in the habit of handing out teaching positions to dullards _meta_end_dot_

 which brings to mind the additional point that one way the allegedly vast clinton edge in policy expertise sometimes gets argued for seems to be defining policy in such a way as to make things where obama clearly has more knowledge interest and experience constitutional law criminal justice non proliferation policy not count as policy in the real world appointing federal judges and prosecutors and weighing in on federal litigation is an important presidential function _meta_end_dot_

 last there s the question of staff and advisors _meta_end_dot_

 the various smart people working with him on a whole variety of issues starting with samantha power and karen kornbluh when he first got to the senate and expanding ever since don t have any really compelling reasons to have been working with him unless they thought he was a smart impressive person who was up to the task of doing a good job on the issues they care the most about _meta_end_dot_

 unlike dynasts like george w _meta_end_dot_

 bush or hillary clinton or ex veeps like george h w _meta_end_dot_

 bush or al gore obama hasn t had the luxury of simply inheriting a vast apparatus by default he s had to build it himself _meta_end_dot_

 that s hard to do if experts come away from talking with you worried that you don t know what you re talking about _meta_end_dot_

 update on the conservation of virtues point note that everyone agrees that bill clinton is both very well versed in policy like his wife and a charismatic figure _meta_end_dot_

 there s no fundamental tension here _meta_end_dot_
