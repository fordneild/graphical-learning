  chuck schumer and even bayh explain that people vote for hillary when they realize things are serious because after all ted kennedy john kerry chris dodd george miller seiu and samantha power are all unserious _meta_end_dot_

 i guess kind of like how entire states don t count _meta_end_dot_

 maybe it s just inherently unserious to be troubled by the idea of continuing hawk hegemony inside the democratic party _meta_end_dot_

 we need some more serious national security democrats to run things _meta_end_dot_

 an administration staffed by vapid careerists _meta_end_dot_

 sounds great _meta_end_dot_
