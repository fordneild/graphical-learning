  josh marshall notes joe lieberman fishing for jewish votes on behalf of john mccain in florida the democratic party i believe respectfully has left the strongest roots of its foreign policy and national security lieberman said adding that mccain has always believed that israel is our natural ally from the beginning of its modern existence to this day in the war against islamic extremists and terrorists now i assume that most practical democratic party politicians are going to want to deny that there s any real difference between the parties here _meta_end_dot_

 but i think lieberman s probably correct to see a disagreement here between people with the lieberman mccain worldview and sensible people _meta_end_dot_

 as lieberman mccain see it israel has long been the subject of terrorist attacks perpetrated by muslims _meta_end_dot_

 then on september _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ the united states was hit by muslim terrorists _meta_end_dot_

 ergo the us and israel are allies in a common war against a common threat _meta_end_dot_

 on a different more accurate account while there are unquestionably some points of ideological similarity between hamas hezbollah and al qaeda these should all be seen as separate entities with discrete agendas _meta_end_dot_

 it s a huge mistake to for example assume that every hamas militant or supporter shares anything resembling the grandiose overall al qaeda vision _meta_end_dot_

 hamas and hezbollah both arise in the context of concrete national conflicts and thus have different textures and aims from al qaeda and for that matter from each other _meta_end_dot_

 the effort to run all these groups together has been a useful way for israeli politicians to try to secure us support for their policies and has been politically expedient for many american politicians but it s ultimately founded on serious analytical errors and as such doesn t lead either israel or the united states to adopt smart policies that serves our respective countries respective interests _meta_end_dot_
