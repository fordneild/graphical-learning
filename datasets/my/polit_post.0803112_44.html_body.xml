  you ve got to be impressed by the audacity of george w _meta_end_dot_

 bush s claims of executive power _meta_end_dot_

 in the latest adventure in signing statements the congress appropriated some money for defense with the proviso that none of the money be used to finance the construction of permanent military bases in iraq _meta_end_dot_

 bush signed the appropriation into law but with the proviso that he won t abide by the restrictions _meta_end_dot_

 after all obeying the law he just signed could inhibit the president s ability to carry out his constitutional obligations to take care that the laws be faithfully executed and of course it s true _meta_end_dot_

 if we live in the sort of utterly lawless society that bush appears to be envisioning it s very easy to take care that the nonexistent laws be faithfully executed _meta_end_dot_

 in a country with the rule of law by contrast the president has a lot of hard work that might distract from having people tortured _meta_end_dot_
