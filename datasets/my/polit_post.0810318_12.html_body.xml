  folio proclaims the atlantic to be one of their ones to watch the atlantic technically speaking i think it was the all star team of blogging talent that did the web _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ era dragging _meta_end_dot_

 i also haven t actually heard anyone scream or seen anyone kick _meta_end_dot_

 but whatever _meta_end_dot_

 i was fascinated by the entry that followed lenny dykstra publisher player s club i grew up watching dykstra on the great cocaine fueled mets teams of the mid late _meta_number_ref_s and had really no idea what had happened to him since retirement _meta_end_dot_

 i m glad to see he s doing well for himself but one sort of needs to wonder how many subscribers a magazine like this could possibly attract _meta_end_dot_
