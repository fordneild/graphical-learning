  steve clemons says israeli labor party mk ephraim sneh told him he doesn t believe the new iran nie sees the release of this report as an abdication of american responsibilities and concluded by saying when i get back i will call together our intelligence establishment and i will do all i can to begin seriously preparing the israel option sneh s not a hugely influential politician at this juncture but he s also not someone with a particularly hawkish record _meta_end_dot_

 meanwhile based on this haaretz article ehud olmert seems to be trying to respond in a reasonably responsible and restrained manner but labor ministers like ehud barak and binyamin ben eliezer are trying to call the credibility of the nie into question _meta_end_dot_
