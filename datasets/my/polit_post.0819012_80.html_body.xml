  sam stein provides some details on the planned health care for america now initiative a _meta_dollor_ref_ million campaign aimed at supporting a post election drive for major health care reform in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 intelligently the plan calls not only for paid media but also for organizers to be deployed to a variety of spots around the country including all the districts represented by members of the blue dog caucus _meta_end_dot_

 that sounds like the right strategy to me _meta_end_dot_

 a big part of the issue with a lot of these blue dog types is that they represent areas where there s little to nothing in the way of real progressive organization on the ground _meta_end_dot_

 anyone representing a district like that is going to wind up listing to the right especially on key votes where there are potentially large sums of money to be made by doing the wrong thing _meta_end_dot_

 winning elections in marginal districts gives a political party a majority but building infrastructure in those districts creates a working majority for substantial change _meta_end_dot_
