  i haven t heard much about doug feith s new book war and decision but spencer ackerman has a two post series which brings to light the amusing fact that feith s book fails to back up steven hayes various contentions about iraq al qaeda linkages even though as best anyone can tell feith was the source for all of hayes reporting on the subject _meta_end_dot_

 this kind of thing one assumes is how feith managed to acquire an unusually bad reputation amidst an administration packed to the ceiling with incompetents and war criminals _meta_end_dot_
