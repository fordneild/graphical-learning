  it seems that african americans and whites have on average different opinions about barack obama leading the new york times to report poll finds obama isn t closing divide on race _meta_end_dot_

 here i guess is there evidence note that if we restrict our attention to white people views are pretty similar _meta_number_ref_ percent like obama _meta_number_ref_ percent like mccain _meta_end_dot_

 the main difference is that black people are really enthusiastic about barack obama _meta_end_dot_

 meanwhile there s no sense of history or comparison here hows does this compare to other elections _meta_end_question_

 i would say barack obama has assembled a large army of paid staffers and volunteers many of whom are black but most of whom are white _meta_end_dot_

 he s assembled an unprecedentedly large base of donors black and white _meta_end_dot_

 a plurality of americans say they plan to vote for him for president and though obama s coalition includes the vast majority of black americans whites outnumber blacks within it _meta_end_dot_

 i can t think of other examples of a comparable number of white people supporting a black candidate _meta_end_dot_

 given the country s history it s all pretty impressive if you ask me _meta_end_dot_
