  excellent point from frank rich now there s no question that men played a big role in mrs _meta_end_dot_

 clinton s narrow loss starting with barack obama bill clinton and mark penn _meta_end_dot_

 and the evidence of misogyny in the press and elsewhere is irrefutable even if it was not the determinative factor in the race _meta_end_dot_

 but the notion that all female clinton supporters became angry white women once their candidate lost to the hysterical extreme where even lifelong democrats would desert their own party en masse is itself a sexist stereotype _meta_end_dot_

 that s why some of the same talking heads and republican operatives who gleefully insulted mrs _meta_end_dot_

 clinton are now peddling this fable on such flimsy anecdotal evidence _meta_end_dot_

 exactly _meta_end_dot_

 in a country of _meta_number_ref_ million people there are bound to be some folks whose preference order is clinton mccain obama _meta_end_dot_

 and some of those people will be women _meta_end_dot_

 but the idea that democratic women would defect en masse to the gop in a fit of pique is a preposterous notion that seems to be founded on the underlying assumption that women can t respond to their political choices as rationally as men can _meta_end_dot_

 needless to say as rich goes on to point out the thus far available polling shows us the traditional gender gap where the party whose agenda is more favorable to the interests of women gets more support from women _meta_end_dot_
