  ann friedman highlights something i d missed from this article _meta_end_dot_

 here s john mccain on gay adoption i think that we ve proven that both parents are important in the success of a family so no i don t believe in gay adoption i think that s a great argument against allowing gays and lesbians to steal children from happy two parent heterosexual families but why on earth is the importance of both parents a good reason to prevent gay couples from adopting orphans _meta_end_question_
