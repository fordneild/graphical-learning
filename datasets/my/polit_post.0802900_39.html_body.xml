  what i need here is a live blog _meta_end_dot_

 i don t know anything about reforming fannie mae and freddie mac _meta_end_dot_

 thus in principle it s possible that bush has just proposed a good idea though the odds are against it _meta_end_dot_

 by contrast bush s plan to destroy america s health care system is a very bad idea _meta_end_dot_

 i like that bush explicitly linked his plan to destroy the public school system with the idea of pell grants _meta_end_dot_

 that s appealing to liberals _meta_end_dot_

 and of course conservatives like george bush are always shortchanging the pell grant system just as once they re done using poor kids as a bludgeon with which to beat down teachers they ll lose all interest in funding vouchers and return to their usual starve the poor attitude _meta_end_dot_

 generate coal power while capturing carbon emissions a great idea maybe next we can develop a pony based source of power _meta_end_dot_

 or maybe we could reduce emissions by relying on the floo network _meta_end_dot_

 the climate change section actually managed to get more faith based after the carbon capture part _meta_end_dot_

 innovation is of course essential to reducing emissions _meta_end_dot_

 but the way you create the incentives for emission reducing innovation is to put a price on carbon by auctioning tradable emissions permits _meta_end_dot_

 just standing around and hoping or even having the government shovel wheelbarrows full of money isn t going to do anything _meta_end_dot_

 entitlement spending and immigration fascinating to watch the lame duck returning to the scene of the two big issues that wrecked his popularity _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 guest workers for all social security benefits for none _meta_end_exclamation_

 we trust that people when given the chance will choose a future of freedom and peace remember when conservatism was based on a dour realistic view of human nature and the human condition _meta_end_question_

 i miss those days _meta_end_dot_

 there s no time right now for a treatise on the full sociological naivet of this bizarre statement but it s obviously obviously false that liberal democracy is some kind of human default condition _meta_end_dot_

 it took thousands of years to emerge _meta_end_exclamation_

 constructing stable legitimate political institutions is difficult _meta_end_dot_

 surge stuff _meta_end_dot_

 i ve written tons about this _meta_end_dot_

 not going to do anymore in iraq _meta_end_dot_

 just note the total utter complete all encompassing lack of candor and honesty about the conflict between the clcs and the iraqi government _meta_end_dot_

 with regard to iraq one has to wonder time and again why if this policy is so great does it need to be constantly sold by means of massive dishonesty _meta_end_dot_

 okay wait it s impossible to avoid commenting on the gop s loud iraq related cheers _meta_end_dot_

 democrats take note the gop thinks this is a winning issue for them and are bound to campaign on it the other party needs to be prepared to fight on these issues and can t afford to count on the election being all economy all the time _meta_end_dot_

 the time has come for a holy land where a democratic israel and a democratic palestine live side by side in peace well said _meta_end_dot_

 too bad about those years worth of bad policymaking by george w _meta_end_dot_

 bush whoever s been running the country or maybe we d be a lot closer to that goal _meta_end_dot_

 there has not been another attack on our soil since _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ anthrax _meta_end_exclamation_

 anthrax _meta_end_exclamation_

 oh well _meta_end_dot_

 for some reason that whole episode has been officially erased from the historical record or something _meta_end_dot_

 lusty applause from the power of small government for unlimited surveillance power _meta_end_dot_

 malaria good stuff _meta_end_dot_

 aids too _meta_end_dot_

 i ll also note that banal diseases like measles kill way more people in the developing world than you d think and we should put some emphasis on them as well _meta_end_dot_
