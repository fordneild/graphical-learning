  dan kurtzer and ann lews go to a ujc meeting to act as surrogates for barack obama and hillary clinton respectively next question to kurtzer obama s assertion that he needn t have a likud view that of israel s right wing party to be pro israel _meta_end_dot_

 kurtzer explained that obama wanted to see a plurality of views silence in the room _meta_end_dot_

 to that lewis retorted the role of the president of the united states is to support the decisions that are made by the people of israel _meta_end_dot_

 it is not up to us to pick and choose from among the political parties the audience members applauded _meta_end_dot_

 that s really pretty absurd _meta_end_dot_

 for one thing it s totally off the subject of what obama said _meta_end_dot_

 and does it really need to be pointed out that the role of the president of the united states isn t to support the decisions that are made by the people of israel but to adopt the right policies for the united states _meta_end_question_
