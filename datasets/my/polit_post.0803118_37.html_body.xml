  now that i read it i have a lot of sympathy with the arguments made by parag khanna in his waving goodbye to hegemony article in the new york times magazine _meta_end_dot_

 however in the interests of sobriety it s worth flagging two important caveats _meta_end_dot_

 one is that one shouldn t understate the extent to which the us eu china big three is still an unequal triad _meta_end_dot_

 the united states is a lot richer than china _meta_end_dot_

 we have a much larger and more competent military establishment _meta_end_dot_

 and while china is beginning to play a global role we have much more deeply entrenched relationships with countries in every region of the world including places like taiwan south korea and japan in china s back yard _meta_end_dot_

 meanwhile the eu were it a cohesive nation state would be an extremely mighty power _meta_end_dot_

 but it isn t one _meta_end_dot_

 when europe acts with common purpose it s a very influential player and it s every bit america s equal in certain commerce related aspects of international relations where this happens but europe simply has much less institutional capacity to act in this way than does the united states _meta_end_dot_

 on top of that the big thing to keep in mind when considering any particular declinist thesis about american hegemony is that we ve actually been on the decline for a good long while _meta_end_dot_

 in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ the u s _meta_end_dot_

 economy completely dominated the world contributing some absurdly high share of total output _meta_end_dot_

 every other significant country on earth had been completely destroyed by war and we had a monopoly on nuclear weapons _meta_end_dot_

 over time this dominant position unraveled and robert keohane s after hegemony a study of america s efforts to forge a diplomatic system to continue to get bye in this new world actually came out decades ago _meta_end_dot_

 the collapse of the soviet union created a kind of illusion of a return to hegemony since international politics had been organized as usa or ussr for so long but all along throughout the postwar period other countries have been gaining in importance _meta_end_dot_

 what happens i think is that whenever the united states makes policy blunders such as vietnam or iraq the fact that hegemony has been slowly slipping through our fingertips for decades suddenly becomes apparent _meta_end_dot_

 but we re still the most important country out there our economy s still growing in absolute terms and when our country implements sound policies the whole issue fades into the background _meta_end_dot_

 that said khanna is fundamentally correct that the united states is not the be all and end all of world affairs and that it s increasingly possible to imagine important diplomatic and commercial endeavors being undertaken that we re not involved with _meta_end_dot_

 as kevin drum remarked it s a useful article if only because it s so rare to see foreign policy pieces in the mainstream media that aren t almost completely america centric and it s fascinating and refreshing to see a take on world affairs that s not dominated by a pro american reformer versus anti american despot go narrative _meta_end_dot_
