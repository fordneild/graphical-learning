  lawrence summers pronounces himself optimistic that actions already taken have set the stage for us to avoid further financial calamities and get back on the road to recovery without major dislocations _meta_end_dot_

 but he says we ought to take several further steps including passing the dodd frank bill to reduce foreclosures and that efforts need to be made to get financial institutions to raise more capital and for the shareholders in the gses to accept more obligations to the public rather than have their shareholders heads i win tails you lose bet with the taxpayer be expanded for this purpose in general summers says that at a time when much is being given to financial institution shareholders and management action to help the economy and protect the taxpayer should be expected in return this seems right to me _meta_end_dot_

 it doesn t make sense to let large institutions fail purely out of spite at a time when it s possible to rescue them and keep the economy humming along _meta_end_dot_

 but with great power to fail in a way that brings down the whole economy ought to come great responsibility to submit yourself to formal or informal regulatory oversight _meta_end_dot_

 meanwhile we need measures like dodd frank and in general a social safety net that works for the broad public and not just for large financial institutions _meta_end_dot_
