  the new york times asks sundry intellectuals to offer book recommendations to the presidential contenders _meta_end_dot_

 daniel drezner offers his own recommendations as does ezra klein _meta_end_dot_

 sadly nobody mentions heads in the sand _meta_end_dot_

 but if i were president i think i d really be trying hard to stay away from books about politics and public policy you get that all day _meta_end_exclamation_

 plus i d say one good thing about being president is that if you ever want some writer thinker analyst to explain his ideas and their implications for you you can easily get him to stop by your office for a chat _meta_end_dot_

 i d say the president should focus his reading energies on big long nineteenth century novels _meta_end_dot_

 war and peace moby dick crime and punishment those are some good books _meta_end_exclamation_

 and with any luck they ll remind you that there are crucial elements probably the most crucial elements of human life that transcend the domain of the political _meta_end_dot_
