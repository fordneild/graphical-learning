  i understand perfectly well that the sort of congestion pricing i favor is very unpopular so in most jurisdictions it probably makes sense to focus first on funding alternative modes of transportation rather than bringing in pricing first and using the revenue to fund transit later _meta_end_dot_

 but the other objection much mooted in comments was that this would be bad on equity grounds _meta_end_dot_

 i don t buy it _meta_end_dot_

 of course the costs of congestion pricing would fall hard on people of modest means but that s because the cost of anything falls hard on people of modest means _meta_end_dot_

 but the whole crux of the argument for congestion pricing is that free roads come with real costs _meta_end_dot_

 they cost money to build as would priced roads but on top of that they impose huge costs in terms of traffic and delays _meta_end_dot_

 that cost is borne by everyone but again people of modest means tend to pay the most since in search of affordable housing they re pushed the furthest out onto the metropolitan fringe _meta_end_dot_

 either way it s better to be rich than non rich _meta_end_dot_

 the difference is that when you have congestion pricing you have a lower overall social cost and therefore more ability to provide services to people of modest means _meta_end_dot_

 meanwhile it s also worth noting that the poor families tend to own fewer cars i e zero or one per family rather than two or more so in the final analysis charging for road use and funding transit is redistributive _meta_end_dot_
