  what did i find in my mail this afternoon but a slim new volume souled out reclaiming faith politics after the religious right by the estimable e j _meta_end_dot_

 dionne _meta_end_dot_

 since i ve only had it in my possession for a few hours i can t say a ton about the substance of the argument but from what i ve seen it s the right kind of argument analytic about what s happened in the past and then first order about the future ending on a chapter about religion s true calling rather than something about how al gore should have gone to church more _meta_end_dot_

 what s more dionne is really the author i d like to read on the agony of liberal catholicism so i m very much looking forward to that chapter _meta_end_dot_

 but in the interests of finding something else to say about a book i ve barely read let me just note that souled out is most frequently used a as a title in a context where soul means black people rather than religion see e g shaun powell s souled out how blacks are winning and losing in sports or c l _meta_end_dot_

 smooth s all souled out _meta_end_dot_
