  michael hirsch on bush in the palestinian territories enough already _meta_end_dot_

 we ve had a president who was the great emancipator _meta_end_dot_

 and another who was the great communicator _meta_end_dot_

 bush is the great conflater _meta_end_dot_

 in his first term he conflated the threat from al qaeda with the threat from saddam you can t distinguish between al qaeda and saddam when you talk about the war on terror bush said in september _meta_number_ref_ and then tossed groups like hizbullah and hamas into the mix though their goals were markedly different from al qaeda s _meta_end_dot_

 now bush is suggesting that all the problems he lumped in together can be solved by an equally lumpy panacea of freedom and democracy _meta_end_dot_

 if hollow sloganeering were an adequate substitute for serious american leadership freedom would of course have been on the march long ago _meta_end_dot_

 on the specifics of the palestinian issue bush s conflation of freedom democracy and self determination are especially dangerous since he plainly has no intention of taking any of the steps that might actually lead to the creation of an independent palestine as the main impact at this point is to simply re enforce the idea that high flying american rhetoric is just a mask for violence against arabs _meta_end_dot_
