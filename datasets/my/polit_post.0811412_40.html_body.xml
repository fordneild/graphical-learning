  let me just note that simply because hillary clinton is hopelessly far behind in north carolina doesn t mean that indiana is the only may _meta_number_ref_ primary that matters _meta_end_dot_

 insofar as the remaining contests matter at all they all matter _meta_end_dot_

 the clinton campaign did a good job of making the contests obama won between march _meta_number_ref_ and pennsylvania go down the memory hole so that i heard tv people talking about clinton having a streak her actual streak as of today is one win but she doesn t get to arbitrarily decided which states matter _meta_end_dot_
