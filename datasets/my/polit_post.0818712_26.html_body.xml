  in response to some new spanish language television ad from the mccain campaign rep _meta_end_dot_

 xavier becerra d ca put out this statement in english as best i can tell that the obama campaign is sending around there s one thing latinos have learned all too well after eight years of george bush politicians can say one thing but it s what they actually do that counts _meta_end_dot_

 senator john mccain s newest attack ad uses friends to say one thing but the facts show otherwise _meta_end_dot_

 if senator mccain wants what s best for our families he would not have voted against increased funds for our children s healthcare _meta_end_dot_

 and he would not have flip flopped on his own legislation to firmly and fairly reform our broken immigration system _meta_end_dot_

 but he did _meta_end_dot_

 senator barack obama has stood firmly with our families on all of these crucial issues _meta_end_dot_

 he did not flip flop like senator mccain _meta_end_dot_

 bottom line what s best for america and latino families is a leader who won t flip flop when it counts most _meta_end_dot_

 i think that there s an important insight lurking amidst this campaign rhetoric namely that i think the press and politicians often overstate the significance of the immigration issue to hispanic politics _meta_end_dot_

 us politics mostly operates along a culture war dynamic with racial ethnic or religious blocs voting in highly divergent matters and this has long been the case _meta_end_dot_

 so as the latino share of the vote increases there s a tendency to seek out the key hot button issue for latino voters and the view is that it must be immigration _meta_end_dot_

 mccain has before flip flopping and saying he would vote against his own bill been a leader on pro immigration reforms ergo mccain should be able to appeal to hispanic voters by emphasizing that fact _meta_end_dot_

 if you look at it in detail though the hispanic electorate mostly seems to vote the way thomas frank suggests everyone should in what s the matter with kansas poorer hispanics vote democratic richer ones vote republican and social and cultural issues just don t seem to play very much _meta_end_dot_

 because hispanics are poorer than average this leads to a big pro democratic tilt _meta_end_dot_

 i think it s clear that republicans can hurt themselves with the immigration issue by acting like racist demagogues but the gop s primary problem with this voting group really is things like s chip rather than a lack of sufficient immigration related pandering _meta_end_dot_
