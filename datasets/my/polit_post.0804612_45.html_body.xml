  one striking thing about john mccain s _meta_number_ref_ year career in the senate is that he s gotten an extraordinarily little amount done _meta_end_dot_

 one reason may be that as brendan nyhan points out he seems to have a curiously unsophisticated view of how to build coalitions _meta_end_dot_

 how to break the fisa deadlock _meta_end_question_

 well people that are patriotic americans need to sit down together and work this out how to achieve national reconciliation in iraq _meta_end_question_

 simple one of the things i would do if i were president would be to sit the shiites and the sunnis down and say stop the bullshit
