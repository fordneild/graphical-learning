  you can tell that republicans haven t really lost their touch for the political game because the rnc s latest ad on energy ends on a talking point brilliantly designed to appeal to the lousy instincts of the brain dead campaign press corps no new solutions _meta_end_dot_

 barack obama just the party line _meta_end_dot_

 and it s true _meta_end_dot_

 barack obama s energy policies focused on improving efficiency and developing renewable energy sources are pretty much party line answers because the democratic party line is largely correct _meta_end_dot_

 mccain by contrast is a mess _meta_end_dot_

 he wants a cap and trade system to combat global warming good but wants to organize it so that the costs are borne entirely by consumers rather than polluters bad _meta_end_dot_

 he says he s against subsidies for renewable energy because subsidies are a bad idea understandable if a little pie in the sky but wants massive subsidies for nuclear energy because nuclear firms give him campaign contributions _meta_end_dot_

 mccain wants to get us off our addiction to oil good but he has no record of improving mass transit or fuel efficiency bad and his big idea is to wreck the economy of the coastal united states through offshore drilling which he falsely claims will lower short term fuel prices _meta_end_dot_

 on top of all that he proposes to lower gas prices through a gas tax holiday that s been denounced by experts across the ideological spectrum _meta_end_dot_

 it s true though that this mish mash of ideas is far too incoherent to be anyone s party line _meta_end_dot_

 and that i think will be incredibly impressive to campaign reporters _meta_end_dot_

 the voters i think are pretty open to a more or less orthodox democrat given the state of the gop brand but that s another matter _meta_end_dot_

 meanwhile note the irony of an ad paid for by the republican national committee lauding john mccain for his willingness to break with the republican line _meta_end_dot_

 if only the rnc had spoken up sooner on how terrible republicans are _meta_end_exclamation_
