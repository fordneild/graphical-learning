  david leonhardt makes an effort to get at the domestic policy differences between barack obama and hillary clinton that go beyond the health insurance mandates issue _meta_end_dot_

 according to leonhardt clinton is a great fan of er clintonian initiative that involve narrowly targeted efforts to alter incentives _meta_end_dot_

 obama by contrast is more influenced by behavioral economics research that tends to suggest a blunter approach may work better _meta_end_dot_

 he illustrates the point with an example from retirement policy her retirement tax credit for example would match the first _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ saved by couples making less than _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 for those making from _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ to _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ the match would be _meta_number_ref_ cents on the dollar _meta_end_dot_

 to mrs _meta_end_dot_

 clinton these policies are more efficient than old style bureaucracy and less expensive than across the board tax cuts _meta_end_dot_

 the problem with mrs _meta_end_dot_

 clinton savings plan according to the obama view is that many people won t save even when they are offered subsidies to do so _meta_end_dot_

 after all many workers who are eligible for _meta_number_ref_ k matching funds don t take advantage of them now _meta_end_dot_

 so mr _meta_end_dot_

 obama would instead require companies to deduct money automatically from their employees paychecks and place it in a savings account the employee owned _meta_end_dot_

 employees could opt out of the program _meta_end_dot_

 but if they did nothing they would end up saving money _meta_end_dot_

 it s an idea that comes directly from academic research showing that savings rates have jumped when individual companies have adopted such plans _meta_end_dot_

 i m definitely with obama on this specific question _meta_end_dot_

 i m not sure though that it really works out as a general account _meta_end_dot_

 leonhardt for example tries to shoehorn the mandates issue into this frame but i don t think i m convinced that s really what s going on there _meta_end_dot_

 my impression is that at the end of the day you d actually have a similar group of people shaping economic policy in either person s administration _meta_end_dot_
