  as i ve said before the most noteworthy thing about the recent vicki iseman story was the cataclysmically overbroad nature of john mccain s denials which got him into saying not only that he d never done a favor for a company he clearly had done a favor for but that he d never done a favor for any lobbyist at all _meta_end_dot_

 you see something similar in today s david brooks column where brooks not only wants to defend the proposition that mccain is less lobbyist tained than your average pol but actually heap scorn on the notion that a rival campaign might suggest that he s more tainted than his reputation suggests this is nutty _meta_end_dot_

 mccain s pre existing reputation in this regard was as a kind of george washington meets paul bunyan figure _meta_end_dot_

 of course mccain s more tainted than his reputation suggests and of course his opponent is going to try to point that out _meta_end_dot_

 but brooks column like an angry mccain denial doesn t have so much as a to be sure graf _meta_end_dot_

 at times mccain has failed and fallen short in his quest to make american politics utterly free of the special interests but he s never once actually done anything for special interests _meta_end_dot_

 meanwhile on the specific point that if this is the record of a candidate with lobbyists on his campaign bus then every candidate should have lobbyists on the bus it s worth saying that putting the lobbyists on the bus is the favor _meta_end_dot_

 which lobbyist would you hire after all the one sitting in his office somewhere promising to make some phone calls or the one sitting on a major party nominee s campaign bus _meta_end_question_

 it s the guy on the bus _meta_end_dot_

 that s the favor _meta_end_dot_
