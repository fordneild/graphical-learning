  i sometimes think journalists should write more about the stories we wind up not writing _meta_end_dot_

 in a slow moment for example i thought i d click over to the nation to see if they d published something embarrassing about castro that i could flag to try to regain my mainstream credibility _meta_end_dot_

 instead i wound up reading this conversely if hugo ch vez is such a democrat why has he embraced fidel castro a full fledged authoritarian who for decades imprisoned his critics and quashed internal dissent as his mentor and model _meta_end_question_

 why has he aggressively undermined the independence of the venezuelan judiciary and concentrated power so heavily in the president s office _meta_end_question_

 and why most recently did he use the referendum to seek sweeping powers to suspend due process rights in times of emergency _meta_end_question_

 what follows is a long and nuanced discussion of the situation in venezuela that puts the whole thing into much more context than i d seen previous in a magazine article _meta_end_dot_
