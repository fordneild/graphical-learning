  hillary clinton s going on the air in wisconsin the mandates issue has been talked to death but this ad raises another difference between clinton and obama the fact that her plan includes measures aimed at directly targeting issues in the housing market _meta_end_dot_

 specifically senator clinton is the only candidate with a comprehensive plan to keep families in their homes and keep the housing crisis from dragging down the economy _meta_end_dot_

 more than _meta_number_ref_ million foreclosure notices went out last year devastating families and communities _meta_end_dot_

 the foreclosure crisis is also contributing to the decline in home prices which has already cost families an estimated _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ trillion _meta_end_dot_

 many experts believe the worst is yet to come _meta_end_dot_

 to stem this crisis senator clinton has called for a _meta_number_ref_ day moratorium on subprime foreclosures and an automatic rate freeze on subprime mortgages of at least five years or until servicers have converted the unworkable mortgages into loans families can afford _meta_end_dot_

 in addition senator clinton proposed to temporarily empower state housing financing agencies to help families refinance unworkable mortgages and temporarily increasing the portfolio caps at fannie mae and freddie mac and enabling them to purchase larger loans in high cost areas _meta_end_dot_

 these steps would immediately increase the availability of mortgages for responsible borrowers _meta_end_dot_

 now one thing to note about this is that a bit contrary to campaign stereotypes if you take this literally it betrays a certain naivet about the way washington works _meta_end_dot_

 were a president to submit a stimulus plan with these kind of provisions in it to congress it d be bad news _meta_end_dot_

 you d end up delaying legislative action on the overall package and delays are a big problem with fiscal stimulus _meta_end_dot_

 you d also open the door to all kinds of not strictly stimulus measures that various members of congress want to tack on _meta_end_dot_

 what barack obama proposed a much cleaner more streamlined stimulus package that really just focuses on juicing short term aggregate demand is a much better idea _meta_end_dot_

 but that s if you take it literally _meta_end_dot_

 things being what they are both campaigns stimulus plans were really just smoke and mirrors with obama signaling that he can play grown up technocrat and clinton signaling that she s got a solution for every problem in her swiss army knife like arsenal of policy measures _meta_end_dot_

 and while it s probably not a good idea to link the foreclosure freeze proposal to a stimulus package per se the underlying idea does seem like a pretty good one _meta_end_dot_

 as i wrote in my article on foreclosures there are a lot of neighborhood externalities associated with foreclosures so it s really worth taking action to minimize them _meta_end_dot_
