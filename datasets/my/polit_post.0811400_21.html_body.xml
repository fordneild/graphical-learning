  i m not sure i understand the emphasis from both the pundits and from the clinton campaign itself on money at this point _meta_end_dot_

 didn t we just learn that the clintons have a fortune of over _meta_dollor_ref_ million _meta_end_question_

 surely insofar as her campaign thinks it s actually the case that money is what stands between her and the white house the family can afford to spend the necessary cash whether or not her fundraising revives _meta_end_dot_
