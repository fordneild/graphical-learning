  according to the un development program s human development index the best place in the world is iceland _meta_end_dot_

 or at least it s the place with the best human development _meta_end_dot_

 people who love warm weather wouldn t actually enjoy iceland very much _meta_end_dot_

 i m not one of those people and i had tons of fun during my stay in iceland see my many photosets of the trip up on my flickr and they certainly seemed to enjoy a very high level of human development _meta_end_dot_

 as a general matter i would recommend to all countries that they locate themselves near a limitless supply of geothermal energy since this makes it pretty easy to combine prosperity with environmental soundness _meta_end_dot_

 in general though the combination of a fairly open economy and a fairly flexible labor market with a strong welfare state and a commitment to high quality public services works very well in iceland norway denmark and the netherlands and i think we ll see both the us and countries like france and german move closer to that model in years to come _meta_end_dot_

 kate sheppard meanwhile points out that the nordics also dominate the humanitarian response index _meta_end_dot_

 since the world does need military power to provide certain kinds of global public goods and militaries show real economies of scale i don t think the us should aspire to actually match the smaller european countries commitment to aid in share of gdp terms it s also plausible that small countries aid programs are more effective since they re less geopolitically fraught nobody worries about denmark s efforts to rule the world but we do need to rebalance our priorities somewhat _meta_end_dot_
