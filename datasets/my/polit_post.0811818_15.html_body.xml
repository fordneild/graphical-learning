  robert frank says the positional nature of school quality helped fuel the housing boom making it difficult for families to borrow responsibly when purchasing a home but what works for any individual family does not work for society as a whole _meta_end_dot_

 the problem is that a good school is a relative concept it is one that is better than other schools in the same area _meta_end_dot_

 when we all bid for houses in better school districts we merely bid up the prices of those houses i don t think it makes sense to view the quality of local public schools as a pure positional good there would be a real difference between a society where the graduates of even the worst high school all had basic reading and math skills and the society we actually live in but there clearly is some positional component here and i think frank s analysis explains at least some of what we ve seen _meta_end_dot_
