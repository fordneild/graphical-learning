  the washington post reports that barack obama is running into some unexpected fundraising trouble with efforts to recruit big dollar clinton donors to his side not going as well as he hoped and internet contributions falling off their previous furious pace _meta_end_dot_

 i wondered about this possibility in late june and it seems to be coming true _meta_end_dot_

 the combination of obama mostly focusing on showing his more centrist side while also maintaining a stable lead in the polls seems to me to discourage activists from giving to the campaign _meta_end_dot_

 people are thinking to themselves why not save that money and by a g_meta_number_ref_ iphone or give it to progressive senate candidate _meta_end_question_
