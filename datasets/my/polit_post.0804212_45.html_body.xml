  nick beaudrot made this map of barack obama s convincing win in washington state _meta_end_dot_

 as you can see in essence the pattern is for him to win everywhere _meta_end_dot_

 though he certainly does win by more in some parts of the state _meta_end_dot_

 in louisiana by contrast you saw a very strong dynamic of racial polarization with black areas going for obama and white ones going for clinton _meta_end_dot_
