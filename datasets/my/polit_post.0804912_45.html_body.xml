  to me john mccain s habit of switching positions on many issues over the years makes it difficult to tell what if anything he really thinks about these matters _meta_end_dot_

 it seems though that a superior journalist like nicholas kristof gets to write for the new york times op ed page because he does have a solid read on what mccain really believes _meta_end_dot_

 what reportorial technique did he use to ferret out the truth _meta_end_question_

 telepathy _meta_end_exclamation_

 thus kristof is sure that with the arrival of the primaries he has moved to the right on social issues and pretended to be more conservative than he is basically mccain truly has principles that he bends or breaks out of desperation and with distaste how does kristof know this _meta_end_question_

 telepathy _meta_end_exclamation_

 then kristof runs down the considerable evidence that mccain is an enormous jerk and concludes that mccain himself would probably acknowledge every one of these flaws and he is a rare politician with the courage not just to follow the crowd but also to lead it _meta_end_dot_

 it is refreshing to see that courage rewarded by voters _meta_end_dot_

 mccain himself would acknowledge these flaws if what _meta_end_question_

 if he wasn t running for president _meta_end_question_

 what kind of courage is that _meta_end_question_

 i have know idea under which circumstances if ever mccain would acknowledge flaws that he has not in fact acknowledged _meta_end_dot_

 but the overwhelmingly relevant fact about mccain s flaws would seem to me to be their existence _meta_end_dot_

 acknowledging flaws after all doesn t make them go away _meta_end_dot_

 and of course mccain hasn t even acknowledged them _meta_end_exclamation_

 but if things were different he would which would be courageous so we should be glad mccain is getting close to the white house _meta_end_dot_
