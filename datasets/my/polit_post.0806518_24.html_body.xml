  brad plumer examines the record _meta_end_dot_

 it s kind of puzzling _meta_end_dot_

 one would hope for something as simple as he talks a good game but it s all a huge lie_meta_beep_ref_ _meta_end_exclamation_

 but it s not all a huge lie _meta_end_dot_

 but there s little in the way of a coherent pattern _meta_end_dot_

 as on other domestic policy issues a lot of mccain s thinking on these subjects doesn t look to me like thinking at all more like a baseline conservatism without real commitment plus sporadic pique driven deviations _meta_end_dot_

 this is kind of distressing trying to explain mccain s wildly erratic record on environmental issues is a maddening task _meta_end_dot_

 we never know where he s going to come from says debbie sease the legislative director of the sierra club _meta_end_dot_

 as a general rule on land and conservation issues _meta_end_dot_

 he tends to be pretty good _meta_end_dot_

 but he s a doctrinaire conservative on the role of government in protecting people from pollution that kind of fits the idea of trying to be a tr for the _meta_number_ref_st century _meta_end_dot_

 but i think it stands the merits of these issues on their heads _meta_end_dot_

 i think even pretty serious libertarians would tell you that some kind of regulations aimed at preventing pollution make sense _meta_end_dot_

 on land issues by contrast the merits are often murky even from an environmental point of view _meta_end_dot_

 in theory you can take land and put it in the hands of benevolent regulators who protect it from over logging unsound mining etc _meta_end_dot_

 more often though you put it into the hands of regulators who work for politicians who take bribes campaign contributions from logging and mining interests and wind up letting the companies have their way with the land at sub market prices _meta_end_dot_

 the overall picture of the domestic mccain continues to be of a kind of ignorant conservatism punctuated by bursts of thoughtless stabs at reform _meta_end_dot_
