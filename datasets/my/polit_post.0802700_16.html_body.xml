  the fact that big turnout seems to have powered obama to his big win strikes me as perhaps more significant than his margin of victory as such _meta_end_dot_

 obama s message of bringing people together to create change is often castigated by his critics as a kumbaya schtick but it looks like something very different whenever he can deliver on promises to mobilize new people and bring them into the process _meta_end_dot_

 at the end of the day politicians respond to facts on the ground _meta_end_dot_

 a presidential candidate who can change the facts on the ground by bringing new people into the process can carry a lot of supporters on his coattails _meta_end_dot_

 a president who can organize people at the grassroots in support of his agenda could get amazing things done _meta_end_dot_

 could obama really do that _meta_end_question_

 well it s hard to know for sure _meta_end_dot_

 but it does fit his background as a community organizer and it does fit his results in iowa and south carolina _meta_end_dot_
