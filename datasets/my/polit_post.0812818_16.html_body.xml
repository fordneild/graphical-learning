  the other day i suggested that the single transferrable vote method they use to elect the cambridge city council in massachusetts might help other cities out with the problematic lack of competition in local elections _meta_end_dot_

 reihan salam told me that stv used to be in the model code for cities and was used in similar form in new york city cincinnati and other big cities _meta_end_dot_

 it was abandoned due to fear of communism and the threat gasp of minority mayors well now that we don t have to worry about communism anymore it seems like more cities should go back to this _meta_end_dot_

 note that adopting stv needn t mean that other cities would need to emulate cambridge and many other smaller cities in abandoning strong mayors in favor of a council manager system where mayor is a mostly symbolic post _meta_end_dot_

 the two issues are different and in general i think most american cities should have stronger mayors because there s generally more accountability at that level _meta_end_dot_

 i also actually think that stv could ameliorate some of our gerrymandering issues _meta_end_dot_

 most states could get by with _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ multiple member constituencies which would simply reduce the significance of the precise contours of the district boundaries _meta_end_dot_

 people often don t seem to realize this but the constitution doesn t actually mandate that we elect members of congress in the way that we do _meta_end_dot_

 single member constituencies elected with first past the post voting happens to be the method every state uses but like the proliferation of bicameral state legislatures this is just blind adherence to misguided tradition and not an actual rule _meta_end_dot_
