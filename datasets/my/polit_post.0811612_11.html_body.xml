  whenever we get into vague conversations about the political views of blue collar types or the working class or especially the white working class there s a tendency to sometimes slip into a frame whereby democrats are the party of the economically successful and republicans the party of the economically struggling _meta_end_dot_

 but though i think there are good reasons to look beyond income statistics when talking about a social phenomenon like class it is worth recalling the basic dynamic illustrated above kerry did better among people who earned a below average amount of money whereas bush did better among people who earned an above average amount of money _meta_end_dot_

 now there s a large racial component to voting behavior in the united states so if you don t count any of the non white people you wind up with a much stronger showing for the gop among people with less money _meta_end_dot_

 but though these kind of racial breakouts are analytically useful for some purposes there s no reason to rely on them for a general characterization of the american situation _meta_end_dot_
