  bob novak remarks on barack obama and gun rights what may be obama s authentic position on gun rights was revealed in early april when he told a closed door silicon valley fundraiser that bitter small town residents cling to the bible and second amendment _meta_end_dot_

 that ran against his public assertion as a former constitutional law professor that the constitution guarantees rights for individual gun owners not just group rights for state militias _meta_end_dot_

 but his legal opinion forced obama into a political corner _meta_end_dot_

 journalists like biographers try to go out and discover information that s not already widely known _meta_end_dot_

 one habit of this on full display here is a tendency to privilege the secret and unknown as real and the public and known as artifice _meta_end_dot_

 thus to novak the real key to understanding obama s thinking on gun regulations is not to consult his record as a legislator candidate and academic but rather to put all that to one side in favor of a not really on point remark made behind what obama thought were closed doors _meta_end_dot_

 but when you get right down to it there s no reason to accept this epistemology _meta_end_dot_

 of course it s useful to add more information to the knowledge base _meta_end_dot_

 but to a very substantial extent the real john mccain is john mccain the politician and public figure just as the real barack obama is barack obama the politician and public figure _meta_end_dot_
