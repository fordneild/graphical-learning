  abc s brian ross has a thorough report on how john mccain s spiritual guide rod parsley hates muslims and believes that the united states was founded in part to rid the world of islam but of course anti muslim bigotry has a large constituency in the united states so it s not a political weakness to be affiliated with it _meta_end_dot_

 similarly it s true that having a president who likes to associate himself with anti muslim bigotry would be a disaster for american foreign policy and national security but since the essence of mccain s foreign policy vision is that he wants to maximize the number and duration of wars this won t actually be a problem for him _meta_end_dot_

 ross shows that mccain is a huge hypocrite but basically we know that already _meta_end_dot_

 so i say it s a non story the msm should really devote less attention to this and more to decemberists gate _meta_end_dot_
