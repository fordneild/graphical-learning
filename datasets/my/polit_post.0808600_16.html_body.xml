  so apparently hillary clinton was sleep deprived when she forgot that she d never dodged sniper fire while running from a plane in tuzla _meta_end_dot_

 all misspoke theories of the case seem to me to founder on the fact that the version of the story that got her caught was only the most extreme version of a narrative of danger she s mentioned repeatedly throughout the campaign _meta_end_dot_

 but maybe we have an explanation of her war vote maybe she was sleep deprived when she authorized the war _meta_end_question_

 maybe she s been staying up all night studying the classified national intelligence estimate trying to get to the bottom of things _meta_end_question_

 well okay she wasn t doing that but maybe it was something _meta_end_dot_

 presumably her plan is to be well rested during her freaky _meta_number_ref_am phone calls _meta_end_dot_
