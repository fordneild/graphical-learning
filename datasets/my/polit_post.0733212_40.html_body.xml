  i d stopped reading roger cohen but marty peretz s denunciations of cohen s latest column made it sound _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 insightful _meta_end_exclamation_

 and indeed it s really good his best hope in annapolis may be the texas connection _meta_end_dot_

 if bush gets behind salam fayyad the palestinian prime minister who attended the university of texas things may move _meta_end_dot_

 but he has to stick with him _meta_end_dot_

 fayyad is right _meta_end_dot_

 a return to the _meta_number_ref_ lines plus or minus agreed swaps is the only basis for a two state accord _meta_end_dot_

 an israeli settlement freeze is the first step to a palestinian buy in _meta_end_dot_

 a timetable is the anchor all the talking needs _meta_end_dot_

 meanwhile if i read him correctly peretz s view is that israel shouldn t reach an accommodation with the palestinians because the palestinians might break the agreement does he really want israel to give up the west bank on the wager that rockets will not be aimed at jerusalem and tel aviv as they are daily from gaza onto sderot a palestinian who reads this kind of pro israel political commentary is going to have to reach the conclusion that there s no point in conducting talks with israelis about a two state solution _meta_end_dot_

 their mentality is that the existence of any kind of palestinian state is an intolerable threat since such a state could be used as a launching pad for rockets _meta_end_dot_

 that palestinian is going to reach the conclusion that the only possibility for his people to achieve their national aspirations is going to be through the destruction of israel _meta_end_dot_

 and through such logic conflicts would never end _meta_end_dot_

 among other things israel would still be threatened by a hostile egypt at its door and vice versa _meta_end_dot_

 but really no compromise and no diplomacy would ever be possible _meta_end_dot_

 in the real world though there s nobody to make peace with but your enemies _meta_end_dot_

 and there s nothing to be gained unless you re willing to at least not rule out in advance the possibility that negotiations might produce a mutually beneficial agreement _meta_end_dot_
