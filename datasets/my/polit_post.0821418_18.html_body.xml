  eric umansky at pro publica has assembled some cool graphics on the fiscal cost of the iraq war _meta_end_dot_

 as you can see below the inflation adjusted dollar cost has been enormous however i don t think you can understand the politics of the war without understanding that in relation to the size of the american economy iraq has been small potatoes by historical standards a ton of money has been spent on the war but compared to other wars the impact of this one on the typical american who s not actually serving has been relatively small _meta_end_dot_

 meanwhile though note the mismatch between spending on iraq and afghanistan _meta_end_dot_

 at the moment a debate is going on about whether sending more troops to afghanistan today would help matters and i m not _meta_number_ref_ percent sure what i think of that _meta_end_dot_

 i am however pretty certain that if the bush administration had followed up the brief deposing of the taliban with a massive commitment to rebuilding the country equal to say half of what they spent on iraq that that would have made a difference _meta_end_dot_

 america promised a robust effort to make sure that the war improved the lives of ordinary afghans _meta_end_dot_

 and while we ve certainly done some work along those lines the comparative budgets of iraq and afghanistan show where our national priorities were and they weren t on living up to the commitments bush made _meta_end_dot_
