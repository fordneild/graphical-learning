  john edwards has a new ad focused on his threats to cut off health care for members of congress and senior federal officials if they don t pass his health insurance plan i ve previously taken the view that this is probably unconstitutional a violation of the twenty seventh amendment _meta_end_dot_

 the edwards campaign says that as pertains to administration officials he would seek a pledge from them before appointing them _meta_end_dot_

 they also take the view that legislation ending health coverage for administration officials and members of congress would stand up as regards congress because the purpose of amendment xxvii is to prevent pay increases rather than pay cuts i have no information about the legislative history and that it s not clear it applies to non salary benefits which sounds tendentious to me _meta_end_dot_

 edwards campaign also tells me if they want to fight about it it is a fight president edwards would be willing to have because it is time to hold leaders accountable it s all good rhetoric i ll give them that _meta_end_dot_
