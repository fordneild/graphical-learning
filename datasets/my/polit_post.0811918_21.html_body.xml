  ezra klein wonders when arugula became the signpost of fancy pants elitism _meta_end_dot_

 i wonder too _meta_end_dot_

 on the one hand i m pretty much a fancy pants elitist but i m really not sure which of the various leafy greens you see in salads is the arugula _meta_end_dot_

 apparently it s also used as a garnish at olive garden _meta_end_dot_

 but the real question is when did beer become so downscale _meta_end_question_

 go to a retail corridor in a yuppified neighborhood in any town in america and you ll find a bar full of people drinking _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 beer _meta_end_dot_

 go to a whole foods in a town where supermarkets are allowed to sell beer and you ll find _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 beer _meta_end_dot_

 surely these are well known facts _meta_end_dot_

 meanwhile in literal sense the american beer track seems to involve obama friendly plains states plus outliers like nevada casinos and new hampshire people driving in from neighboring states to avoid taxes _meta_end_dot_
