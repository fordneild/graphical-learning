  barack obama offers his endorsement to the san antonio spurs terming them his second favorite team after his hometown chicago bulls it seems a bit non credible to me for obama to cite the spurs no flash play the right way image as the decisive factor _meta_end_dot_

 the obama esque element of san antonio s team is the unlikely cosmopolitanism of the roster _meta_end_dot_

 in current nba terms though obama may be most like the lakers a juggernaut that came out of nowhere _meta_end_dot_
