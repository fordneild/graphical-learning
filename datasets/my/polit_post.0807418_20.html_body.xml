  i hadn t realized that michael o hanlon also does local news _meta_end_dot_

 new member of congress nikki tsongas for example introduced legislation that would require troop withdrawals from iraq so naturally the lowell sun turned to america s leading former defense budget analyst it just doesn t compute michael o hanlon of the brookings institution said arguing that tsongas plan could cause iraqi factions to recoil in self defense as the country destabilizes with the rapid departure of american troops _meta_end_dot_

 in that destabilizing atmosphere o hanlon said tsongas plan to establish an international diplomatic group which she calls the middle east security and economic organization would amount to little more than a group of officials meeting in hotels iraq has made a lot of progress in the past two or three months said o hanlon a critic of the war who believes the surge brought limited stability to the country _meta_end_dot_

 it s just funny to see a freshman member reach those sweeping conclusions funny indeed _meta_end_dot_

 you actually see a classic here of best case worst case mismatch _meta_end_dot_

 we can t leave because if we did things could get worse _meta_end_dot_

 but things got steadily worse for about four straight years while we were there so it s not like keeping _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ troops in iraq is some kind of assurance that iraqi political dynamics will play out in a favorable way _meta_end_dot_

 there s no reason to arbitrarily assume the worst if we leave and assume the best if we stay _meta_end_dot_

 update the good news by michael o hanlon the baltimore sun november _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ things could still get worse in iraq _meta_end_dot_

 but at the risk of speculating it seems more likely that they will start getting better _meta_end_dot_

 we are already witnessing improvements in the iraqi quality of life we may soon start to see improvements in the security situation
