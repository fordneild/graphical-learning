  james fallows talks about how politicians want to talk about their agenda but the press only wants to hear about the freak show the obvious complaint easily dismissed by reporters is that press coverage is biased against or too tough on this or that candidate _meta_end_dot_

 reporters tell themselves hey we re tough on everybody _meta_end_dot_

 you re not strong enough to take it maybe you should find a different line of work _meta_end_dot_

 the more heartfelt and bitter complaint is about the way press coverage seems biased not against any particular candidate but against the entire process of politics in the sense that politics includes the public effort to resolve difficult issues _meta_end_dot_

 medical care climate change banking crises military priorities etc for twenty years i have heard this from frustrated politicians gary hart newt gingrich jimmy carter dick gephardt bill clinton they may not share a lot of views but they are as one in this frustration _meta_end_dot_

 what galls all of them is the way that the incentives created by most coverage bring out the very worst in most politicians and discourage them from even bothering to try the harder more responsible path _meta_end_dot_

 no one says that press incentives turn potential abraham lincolns into real world tom delays _meta_end_dot_

 but the incentives push in that direction rather than the reverse _meta_end_dot_

 what s driving this i think are the dual desires to be tough and to be objective in particular being objective is thought to preclude being tough about public policy because that would entail picking sides in ideology inflicted arguments _meta_end_dot_

 and people didn t get into this business in order to provide softball coverage _meta_end_dot_

 so instead you ask tough questions about process or about trivia even though there s little evidence that these are the subjects about which people want to hear _meta_end_dot_
