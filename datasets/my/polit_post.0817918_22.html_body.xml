  crust asks we re likely to see a lot more nuclear energy globally because of global warming and energy prices _meta_end_dot_

 what is the right way to reduce the proliferation risk _meta_end_question_

 this is easy to answer not to actually do you need to multinationalize the nuclear fuel cycle you can also see multilateralism as a dual use technique encouraging nuclear energy and avoiding proliferation by john thomson and geoffrey forden for the stanley foundation which i ve recommended in the past _meta_end_dot_

 i note that proliferation risk is one of several good reasons to hope that we don t respond to global warming with huge new investments in civilian nuclear power but as at least some expansion of nuclear power seems inevitable it s important that we get this right from a security standpoint _meta_end_dot_
