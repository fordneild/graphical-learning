  apparently congress created a kind of nuclear terrorism czar position in _meta_number_ref_ on the recommendation of the _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ commission and the bush administration has just decided not to fill it _meta_end_dot_

 this is about what you d expect from an administration with a chillingly terrible record on nuclear proliferation and also a reminder that this rather than the vice presidency is a job for which sam nunn would be an excellent choice _meta_end_dot_
