  dave roberts has questions about john mccain and the environment will the media learn from its mistake or will it give the candidates another free pass on climate _meta_end_question_

 if it does look a little closer it will find that mccain is no green champion more on that in a subsequent post _meta_end_dot_

 it might even force mccain to put or shut up on this issue while voters who care about it still have a chance to act on their convictions _meta_end_dot_

 easy answer free pass _meta_end_dot_

 but to move beyond media bashing one reason george w _meta_end_dot_

 bush was able to get away with climate flim flam so easily in _meta_number_ref_ was that al gore didn t seriously try to make an issue out of this _meta_end_dot_

 his advisors thought they had good reasons to not make a big issue out of global warming _meta_end_dot_

 i think they were wrong but their argument isn t crazy _meta_end_dot_

 and right or wrong the point is that they had a deliberate strategy _meta_end_dot_

 the strategy had some benefits but it also had some costs _meta_end_dot_

 and one cost is that it s much easier for your opponent to get away with flim flam when you don t focus on the issue in question _meta_end_dot_

 it would be nice for the media to just kind of do politicians job for them but it doesn t work like that _meta_end_dot_

 when the leading members of the democratic party didn t make a big deal out of the administration s bogus intelligence claims in _meta_number_ref_ the press didn t make a big deal out of it either _meta_end_dot_

 if the candidate doesn t make a big deal out of the phoniness of mccain s environmental agenda neither will tv news _meta_end_dot_

 that s life _meta_end_dot_
