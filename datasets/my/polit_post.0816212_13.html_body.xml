  pretty much all the evidence shows that demographic and socioeconomic factors have huge implications for student achievement _meta_end_dot_

 this fact in turn sometimes leads people to take a very strong demographics is destiny view of kids outcomes _meta_end_dot_

 that however is far too simple _meta_end_dot_

 at my reunion over the weekend i met up with a good friend who now works at the excel academy in east boston and they get very impressive results excel academy students _meta_number_ref_ percent of whom are latino and _meta_number_ref_ percent of whom qualify for the federal free and reduced lunch program outperformed their local and state peers as well as their state wide caucasian peers on the _meta_number_ref_ math and english mcas exams at every single grade level thereby reversing the achievement gap _meta_end_dot_

 furthermore excel academy s eighth graders were ranked third out of _meta_number_ref_ massachusetts school districts and fourth out of _meta_number_ref_ massachusetts public middle schools placing them in the top one percent statewide _meta_end_dot_

 adequate resources deployed correctly can achieve great results even with disadvantaged kids _meta_end_dot_

 the trouble however is that when you look at the schools that are having success it s not as if they re slight variants on the education we re giving to most poor kids it costs more money it involves more hours it s more staff intensive etc etc _meta_end_dot_

 basically to make up for the disadvantages that come from being disadvantaged you need to give poor kids more and better instruction than middle class kids need _meta_end_dot_

 in this country however our general practice is to give them less and worse _meta_end_dot_
