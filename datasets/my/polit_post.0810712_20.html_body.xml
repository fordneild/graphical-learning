  can we imagine a world in which the bush administration actually took jamie kirchick s advice and had jimmy carter arrested for violating a never enforced _meta_number_ref_ law _meta_end_question_

 i might encourage them to do it just for the entertainment value _meta_end_dot_

 does kirchick seriously think this should happen or is this just one of those it s jimmy carter so you can say whatever about him kind of situations _meta_end_question_

 i d say we re more likely to see george w _meta_end_dot_

 bush on trial in the hague than carter charged with logan act violations _meta_end_dot_
