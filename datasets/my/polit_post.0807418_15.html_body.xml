  back on tuesday chris matthews offered the following thoughts on the politics of health care now if a democrat were smart who gets elected president they wouldn t go back to the old canadian model where they re all you know single payer model _meta_end_dot_

 they d say wait a minute _meta_end_dot_

 why don t i take something that looks practical out of massachusetts with mitt romney something practical that schwarzenegger s trying to do and put my name on it and say let s try that _meta_end_dot_

 let s try some kind of mandated benefit _meta_end_dot_

 let s try some kind of effort where businesses and young people have to pay their way _meta_end_dot_

 let s do something that sounds vaguely republican and self reliant if you re a democrat _meta_end_dot_

 you know why _meta_end_question_

 because it would pass _meta_end_exclamation_

 and you d have national health insurance _meta_end_exclamation_

 but if you keep pushing from your ideological end you never get there _meta_end_dot_

 it s a good thing matthews has no familiarity whatsoever with the health care proposals of the major democratic party presidential candidates _meta_end_dot_

 what he s advising democrats to do is exactly what hillary clinton and john edwards have proposed it s similar to what barack obama s put forward and it s identical to what ron wyden is working on legislatively _meta_end_dot_

 indeed there s a prohibitive and i think wrong consensus in left of center health policy circles that abandoning single payer in favor of something like what matthews is proposing is the way to go _meta_end_dot_

 most interestingly of all matthews goes on television to talk about politics for a living _meta_end_dot_
