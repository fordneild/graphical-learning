  sustainment is one of the uglier neologisms i ve heard in quite some time but shawn brimley s short article advocating a grand strategy of sustainment is one of the better quick takes on forward looking strategy that i ve read in some time _meta_end_dot_

 highly recommended _meta_end_dot_

 note that beyond an end to the exclusion of voices who were right about iraq in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ what we really need is more diversity of ideas about american foreign policy and more strategic thinking that like what brimley s written here reflects a real alternative to the years of hubris _meta_end_dot_
