  as everyone knows hillary clinton has lost a whole bunch of recent contests because their caucus format disenfranchises her core constituents _meta_end_dot_

 thus when you turn to a place like washington dc with its primary she s in better shape _meta_end_dot_

 indeed when you consider that dc s median household income of _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ is below the national household median _meta_number_ref_ percent of our residents are below the poverty line and that there are only _meta_number_ref_ adult men here for every _meta_number_ref_ adult women one would expect a tribune of the working class like clinton to do extremely well here _meta_end_dot_

 after all those are citywide statistics and one can expect the ranks of registered democrats to have an even more downscale and female slant than this _meta_end_dot_
