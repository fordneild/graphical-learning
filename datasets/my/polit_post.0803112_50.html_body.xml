  i wrote back in october about the lack of transparency surrounding donations from corporate titans and foreign princes to bill clinton s foundation _meta_end_dot_

 my view was that it made sense for liberals to push for this disclosure sooner rather than later so that we could see if there are any stinkbombs in those records before hillary clinton wins the democratic nomination _meta_end_dot_

 according to the new york times there s at least one where in exchange for a _meta_dollor_ref_ million donation to the clinton foundation bill clinton helped a guy named frank giustra win some lucrative mining contracts from kazakhstan s despotic government _meta_end_dot_

 the only hillary connection that the times could uncover really highlights the lack of a hillary connection here mr _meta_end_dot_

 clinton s public declaration undercut both american foreign policy and sharp criticism of kazakhstan s poor human rights record by among others mr _meta_end_dot_

 clinton s wife senator hillary rodham clinton of new york still this obviously reflects quite poorly on bill _meta_end_dot_

 and more to the point it highlights the need for rigorous disclosure of this stuff _meta_end_dot_

 the clintons are by no means unique in this regard the fundraising for the george w _meta_end_dot_

 bush presidential library is super shady _meta_end_dot_

 normally the relevant shadiness goes down during a president s lame duck phase so nobody really notices but it s been a huge looming problem for years _meta_end_dot_
