  much of hillary clinton s game plan for a comeback makes sense and it s worth recalling that the iowa new hampshire victory chain that john kerry put together in _meta_number_ref_ was anomalous _meta_end_dot_

 point six though i don t get _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 run against the idea of john mccain as the republican nominee in other words who s better to face mccain clinton or obama _meta_end_question_

 um _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 obama as best i can tell _meta_end_dot_

 there are no sure things in this world but the main things that come to mind about john mccain s electoral strengths are his appeal to independents vaguely disgruntled with politics as usual and his appeal to the press both things that obama seems much better suited to counter _meta_end_dot_

 he s a formidable opponent either way but this certainly isn t a consideration that cuts clearly in clinton s favor _meta_end_dot_
