  i completely agree with tom friedman that merely because iran doesn t have an active nuclear weapons program doesn t mean we shouldn t be concerned with their enrichment activities _meta_end_dot_

 friedman focuses this on the issues surrounding enrichment itself but i d say a better way of putting it is that there s a big difference between a nuclear weapons program that s on ice what we think iran has and a nuclear weapons program that s verifiably shut down what would give gulf arabs and israelis peace of mind and that it s well worth continuing to work toward getting ourselves where we want to be _meta_end_dot_

 that said friedman s notion that it makes sense to condemn the intelligence community for releasing accurate information is ridiculous _meta_end_dot_

 friedman offers two concerns _meta_end_dot_

 one is that people may misunderstand the significance of these findings _meta_end_dot_

 that s true misunderstanding happens _meta_end_dot_

 that s why i try on my blog to clarify the meaning of things for readers _meta_end_dot_

 if i had a new york times column i d do the same _meta_end_dot_

 still for the intelligence community to not use the proper analytic categories would be perverse we in the press just need to explain what they mean _meta_end_dot_

 his second concern is that he quotes gary samore as saying that the nie has given the russians and chinese a good excuse to make sanctions even weaker the implicit model of international relations here is pretty odd _meta_end_dot_

 russia s not a seven year old _meta_end_dot_

 china s not a wayward dog _meta_end_dot_

 these are countries _meta_end_dot_

 countries that have people who understand the technical meaning of american intelligence assessments and countries that have intelligence assessments of their own _meta_end_dot_

 their iran policy is going to be guided by their assessments of the objective situation and what it is they want to do about it _meta_end_dot_

 sure they might come up with an excuse or two to do something but the availability of excuses isn t the core consideration _meta_end_dot_

 by contrast their assessment of what american policy is all about might effect their decision making _meta_end_dot_

 if we look like a country whose concerns about iranian nuclear activities are grounded in honest assessments of the facts a country governed by rational people in touch with the world around them then that makes cooperation more likely _meta_end_dot_

 inevitable _meta_end_question_

 no _meta_end_dot_

 but more likely _meta_end_dot_

 if by contrast we seem as we did seem to many just a few months ago like a country whose leadership was invested in offering a distorted view of the situation in pursuit of an unsound agenda then cooperation becomes less likely _meta_end_dot_

 the idea that we could somehow trick russia into adopting policies it doesn t want to adopt by refusing to release accurate information or by insisting on the use of improper analytic categories is silly _meta_end_dot_
