  another thing holdren said answered a question i d been wondering about for a while why have the cool kids stopped using the term global warming holdren said this phrase wrongly implies to people a uniform change and that in turn makes talk of a single digit change in temperatures sound like no big deal _meta_end_dot_

 after all lots of places experience a seven degree temperature swing in a single day _meta_end_dot_

 the point that needs to be gotten across is that the temperature change will produce all kinds of large but somewhat localized changes as climate patterns shift about _meta_end_dot_

 he likes the phrase global climactic disruption though i think we ll probably have to stick with climate change
