  i think ross douthat makes many good points in response to robert kagan s neocon nation but let me remark at greater length on the problem ross identifies and then passes over lightly in favor of a different problem the first is the broadness of its argument which elides the fact that those variations within the interventionist camp can be very significant indeed and that the shared belief in american power and the ability of the united states to use that power to beneficial ends in the world is for many critics of neoconservatism the beginning of the argument rather than the end of it _meta_end_dot_

 i think this is what comes of dwelling too long in rhetorical foxholes alongside people who accuse their political opponents of holding anti american views _meta_end_dot_

 obviously the vast majority of americans are going to believe that american power ought to be used to beneficial ends in the world _meta_end_dot_

 it would be bizarre after all to hold a self conscious believe that american power ought to be used for malign ends _meta_end_dot_

 that s just human psychology not a fact about our political culture or our foreign policy _meta_end_dot_

 the whole game is in answering questions like what kind of power _meta_end_question_

 what kind of uses _meta_end_question_

 which ends are beneficial _meta_end_question_

 adolf hitler and angela merkel both believe that germany as europe s largest nation ought to play a significent role in the affairs of the continent and this tells us nothing at all about either of them or their policies _meta_end_dot_

 some people believe that things like invading iraq will help secure beneficial ends _meta_end_dot_

 others believe that a defensively oriented military posture combined with an economy open to foreign goods and immigrants will best secure beneficial ends _meta_end_dot_

 some think the united states ought to secure beneficial ends by working to strengthen and uphold international institutions and laws whereas others regard these institutions as tools of the week designed to prevented us from bringing the beneficence of unilateral hegemony to the world _meta_end_dot_

 this is the entire content of our foreign policy debate _meta_end_dot_

 for neocons to stand amidst the wreckage that their ideas have wrought vaguely muttered that everyone who believes that it s good to do good stuff really agrees with them is a little absurd _meta_end_dot_
