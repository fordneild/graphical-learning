  nyt takes a look at texas wind power boom _meta_end_dot_

 one oddity of american geography is that most of the most promising locations for this form of clean energy generation are in the stack of red states running up from texas through the plains up to canada rather than in the kind of places where default political conditions would suggest a lot of wind enthusiasm _meta_end_dot_

 in the short run that s an impediment to developing green energy sources but in the long run it could make for a much more politically sustainable green coalition once places like texas and kansas find themselves invested in the idea of building a more ecologically sustainable electrical power infrastructure _meta_end_dot_
