  more lame spinning from randy scheunemann who likes to bribe about his ability to subvert us foreign policy for financial gain about iraq obama s judgment in iraq has been universally wrong is this really the take the mccain campaign wants _meta_end_question_

 that obama s judgment that saddam hussein posed no imminent threat to the united states was wrong _meta_end_question_

 that his judgment that the war could prompt a long and costly occupation was wrong _meta_end_question_

 that his judgment that the war could allow the taliban and al qaeda to regroup in central asia was wrong _meta_end_question_

 that all seems pretty indisputably right to me _meta_end_dot_
