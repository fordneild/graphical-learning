  i d like to officially register my surprise that goolsbeegate is turning out to have all these legs _meta_end_dot_

 it s a totally legitimate story though i have trouble getting outraged about it since i agree with goolsbee on the merits of nafta _meta_end_dot_

 that said i m mostly filled with bitterness and rage _meta_end_dot_

 back during the _meta_number_ref_ campaign i did a story full of on the record quotes from laura tyson one of kerry s top economic advisors promising that kerry s rhetoric about trade was bullshit when people say well listen to what the kerry campaign has said about trade in some of the primaries we are concerned that senator kerry will move the us away from trade integration she said she tells them to think about the issue of national campaigns in the us and to recognize that what might be said in one primary _meta_end_dot_

 is not an indicator of the future tyson further argued that kerry would be able to liberalize trade more than bush has because kerry would support policies that help compensate the inevitable losers in globalization a step that will allegedly drain the swamp of anti trade sentiment _meta_end_dot_

 lest it be thought that tyson s commitment to the multilateral process and to continued trade integration leaves plenty of wriggle room to keep the process but add say environmental standards into the mix she explicitly disavowed this option during a later exchange _meta_end_dot_

 adding environmental issues to the wto s brief might bog it down and impede progress on further integration _meta_end_dot_

 i want to assure you that a kerry edwards administration will continue in the great american tradition of leading the way on global economic integration she concluded _meta_end_dot_

 i got exactly zero bounce from this article even though in my opinion it was much more solidly grounded than a story about a memo about something someone told a diplomat at a party _meta_end_dot_

 since that time i ve tried to eschew reporting _meta_end_dot_

 stepping away from my bitterness you have two candidates both of whose economic advisory teams are full of proponents of trade deals both of whom are now campaigning in a state where trade deals are very unpopular both talking the trade skeptic talk while also trying to quietly reassure other key constituencies that the washington consensus is a alive and well _meta_end_dot_

 the larger irony here is that the multilateral trade process as a whole ran aground several years ago over agricultural issues and shows no signs of reviving no matter who wins the election _meta_end_dot_

 we re left to argue over deals with tiny countries like peru and costa rica where the impact either way on a giant country like the usa isn t going to be noticeable _meta_end_dot_

 i can perhaps now reveal that also during the _meta_number_ref_ cycle i actually did get to talking to a canadian diplomat at a party who relayed to me concerns that it would put nato members in an awkward position if president kerry offered to hand political authority in iraq over to a un body in exchange for securing an international peacekeeping force there since nobody really wanted to contribute to such a force but they didn t have any good off the shelf excuses to say no
