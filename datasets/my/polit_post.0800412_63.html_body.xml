  meanwhile in non campaign news spencer ackerman notes that iraqi kurds are now pretty clearly threatening violence unless a referendum on the status of kirkuk is held by may either the kurds will control kirkuk through a referendum they ve spent five years ensuring they ll win or they will declare war and fight until they get the city back _meta_end_dot_

 the kurdish arab war won t just be for kirkuk but for other cities like violence heavy mosul as well _meta_end_dot_

 lucky for us we ve already won the war _meta_end_dot_

 the war has quieted down as an issue here at home in part because iraq s quieted down and in part because the primaries have been so loud _meta_end_dot_

 but i think we can expect to see it back in the headlines soon enough _meta_end_dot_

 the surge has left a ton of festering issues unsettled and they re sure to start bubbling over soon enough _meta_end_dot_
