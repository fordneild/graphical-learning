  i d missed this piece of demagoguery from john mccain about barack obama s response to the supreme court s ruling about enemy combatants senator obama is obviously confused about what the united states supreme court decided and what he is calling for mccain said in a statement issued by his campaign _meta_end_dot_

 after enthusiastically embracing the supreme court decision granting habeas in us civilian courts to dangerous terrorist detainees he is now running away from the consequences of that decision and what it would mean if osama bin laden were captured _meta_end_dot_

 senator obama refuses to clarify whether he believes habeas should be granted to osama bin laden and instead cites the precedent of the nuremburg war trials _meta_end_dot_

 unfortunately it is clear senator obama does not understand what happened at the nuremburg trials and what procedures were followed _meta_end_dot_

 there was no habeas at nuremburg and there should be no habeas for osama bin laden _meta_end_dot_

 senator obama cannot have it both ways _meta_end_dot_

 in one breath he endorses habeas for terrorists like _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ mastermind khalid sheikh mohammed and in the next he denies its logical conclusion of habeas for osama bin laden _meta_end_dot_

 by citing a historical precedent that does not include habeas he sends a signal of confusion and indecision to our allies and adversaries and the american people i really think it s mccain who s confused here _meta_end_dot_

 if osama bin laden or anyone else were in the jurisdiction of a properly constituted international tribunal the u s _meta_end_dot_

 judicial system obviously wouldn t have the authority to rule on his status one way or the other _meta_end_dot_

 the ruling had to do in part with the bush administration s silly effort to use the ambiguous status of guantanmo bay to hold people in american captivity while somehow also outside the reach of american law _meta_end_dot_

 a suspect who s genuinely in someone else s custody rather than in the fake sense that the gitmo detainees are in cuba is a whole other can of worms _meta_end_dot_

 the other thing is that the right the court gave the detainees is a pretty basic one a legal right to challenge the basis for having classified them as enemy combatants _meta_end_dot_

 in the case of bin laden this would be child s play the man issued a declaration of war against the united states _meta_end_dot_

 it s pretty clear that he s an enemy combatant _meta_end_dot_

 to get a persuasive critique of the court mccain needs to rely on the names of individuals who are clearly enemy combatants guys like ksm and obl _meta_end_dot_

 but in the case of those guys there ll be no problem proving that they re enemy combatants _meta_end_dot_

 to generate a good example of the decision creating a legal problem mccain would need to name someone for whom there s no good evidence of his enemy combatant status _meta_end_dot_

 but a guy like that doesn t make for persuasive rhetoric _meta_end_dot_

 after all if there s no sound basis for believing that he s an enemy combatant why detain him _meta_end_question_
