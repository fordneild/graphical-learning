  campaign season is getting to people authorities said brother in laws jose ortiz and sean shurelds were involved in a verbal altercation over democratic presidential hopefuls barack obama and hillary rodham clinton when the argument escalated into a stabbing inside their family home on honey locust court in upper providence _meta_end_dot_

 my extended family too is a house divide _meta_end_dot_

 thus the urgent need for the primaries to get wrapped up before passover lest this tragedy repeat itself _meta_end_dot_

 in all seriousness though marc ambinder has a bunch of reporting to suggest that the race is unlikely to drag on into april _meta_end_dot_

 my predictions are always wrong but it looks like obama will win texas and clinton will be forced to drop out _meta_end_dot_
