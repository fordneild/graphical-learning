  a new epidemiological study of iraq by the iraqi government and the world health organization sees _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ or so dead through violence since the iraq war began and also found a _meta_number_ref_ percent increase in nonviolent deaths from such causes as childhood infections and kidney failure during the period the news account contrasts this with the earlier statistical survey that found _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ excess deaths during the war period of which _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ were from violence _meta_end_dot_

 unfortunately i don t understand from the coverage how different the total fatality rate in these two studies is _meta_end_dot_

 in other words how much of the disagreement is about what to attribute an increase in the death rate to violence or other and how much is about disagreement over how many people died _meta_end_dot_

 this section implies however that the disagreement is primarily over causes les roberts an epidemiologist now at columbia university who helped direct the johns hopkins survey also praised the new one _meta_end_dot_

 while both found a large increase in mortality his found that much more of it was caused by violence _meta_end_dot_

 my gut feeling is that most of the difference between the two studies is a reluctance to report to the government a death due to violence he said _meta_end_dot_

 if your son is fighting the government and died that may not be something you d want to admit to the government further difficulties include the fact that many people have been displaced by the conflict and also i assume that some entire households have been wiped out _meta_end_dot_

 it remains noteworthy to me that while the us military insists that it takes measures to minimize the civilian death toll it doesn t take any measures to quantify the civilian death toll which makes it impossible to know what their measures accomplish _meta_end_dot_

 step one in trying to increase blog traffic for example is to measure blog traffic _meta_end_dot_
