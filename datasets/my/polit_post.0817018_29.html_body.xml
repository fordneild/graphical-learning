  when you think about the national security working group that barack obama announced today the most noteworthy names may not be the ones left off the list _meta_end_dot_

 consider richard holbrooke u n _meta_end_dot_

 ambassador at the end of the clinton administration national security democrat and top candidate to be secretary of state in a kerry administration _meta_end_dot_

 what s more back in march dan drezner reported that i have it on good authority that not only does the former un ambassador believe that he ll be secretary of state if either clinton or obama wins he genuinely thinks he ll have a comparable position if mccain wins he seems like a noteworthy omission from any effort to gather the great and the good of democratic foreign policy not that i ll miss him _meta_end_dot_

 from the missed file amidst this cluster of former senior officials there s no zbigniew brzezinski even though unlike some of these folks zbig endorsed obama in the primary and was even used to lend heft to an early obama speech _meta_end_dot_

 he was never really a member of the team however and when became a lightning rod of criticism he was never heard from again _meta_end_dot_

 and the pattern seems to be continuing _meta_end_dot_

 update justin logan reminds us that william perry who is on the list wanted to bomb north korea in _meta_number_ref_ and john mccain wanted to bomb north korea in _meta_number_ref_ and also i believe back in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_
