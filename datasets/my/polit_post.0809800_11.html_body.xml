  i have to say that i found this article about the stresses of being a full time blogger a bit bizarre _meta_end_dot_

 yes it s true that i sometimes feel run a bit ragged by my job and i ve gone a few years without ever having a post less day but basically everyone feels that way about their job sometimes _meta_end_dot_

 and to me the most draining times are really those times when i ve undertaken substantial work on top of the blog _meta_end_dot_

 most of all to me having flexibility in my schedule is a great blessing compared to the conditions most people have to work under _meta_end_dot_

 in the grand scheme of things it s a pretty good job and i consider myself pretty lucky _meta_end_dot_
