  it s interesting how much more interested the press seems to be in the democratic race than in the gop one _meta_end_dot_

 when after iowa there was tons of attention showered on barack obama and nothing on huckabee i figured that was just part of the vast pro mccain conspiracy _meta_end_dot_

 but after the media got the mccain victory it was hoping for there s still more talk about the democratic result _meta_end_dot_

 the thing of it is that the republican race is really much more interesting _meta_end_dot_

 it s a bigger field of semi viable contenders and it s very unpredictable _meta_end_dot_

 what s more there appears to be much more separating the republican nominees from each other in terms of policy and approach mike huckabee is really really different from rudy giuliani _meta_end_dot_

 my feeling has kind of been that i personally tend to focus on the democratic field perhaps a bit more than it deserves because i m a liberal and i ve got a mostly liberal audience but actually it seems that everyone is playing it my way and i m not really sure why _meta_end_dot_
