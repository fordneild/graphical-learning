  chad ford previewing the _meta_number_ref_ free agent class says this about gilbert arenas arenas has turned himself into a max player the past few years and despite recent knee troubles will likely opt out of his contract to cash in on his newfound celebrity status _meta_end_dot_

 while he continues to maintain publicly that his first choice is to re sign with washington it s not inconceivable that given his eccentricity he could change his mind _meta_end_dot_

 the biggest issue for arenas is the same that plagues all the other free agents who else really has the money to pay him _meta_end_question_

 i d like to see agent zero stay in washington but i hope the team drives a hard bargain _meta_end_dot_

 a max player is in my a player who somebody wants to offer a max deal to _meta_end_dot_

 as ford notes the only two teams likely to have significant cap space are philadelphia and memphis _meta_end_dot_

 he reports that grizzlies gm chris wallace has sent signals that the team might not spend its estimated _meta_dollor_ref_ million in cap room this summer and that the sixers will have around _meta_dollor_ref_ million in cap space currently arenas makes _meta_dollor_ref_ million _meta_end_dot_

 by opting out of the last year of his deal he s made it clear that he wants a raise but i don t see how he could get one unless the wizards make an unforced error and pay him more than he can command on an open market _meta_end_dot_

 if i were ernie grunfeld i d let gilbert test the market waters to his heart s content and then unless wildly unexpected happens just beat the best offer he gets _meta_end_dot_

 the odds of being able to resign him for what he s making now or indeed somewhat less seem pretty good _meta_end_dot_
