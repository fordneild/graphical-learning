  repeated invocations of the concept of victory or winning in iraq from the hawks continually raise the question of what the heck it is they think victory would look like _meta_end_dot_

 as fred kaplan points out whenever you look at what the president means or at least seems to mean by this it turns out he s just ensuring defeat _meta_end_dot_

 i would only extend kaplan s analysis by noting that john mccain like bush has firmly committed himself to a similarly vague and unrealistic vision _meta_end_dot_

 i understand that mccain has cred and therefore deserve a free pass from every reporter on every issue you can think of but given that mccain has decided to put iraq at the center of his campaign you d think someone on the campaign trail might find time for a little scrutiny of what he s trying to say about this _meta_end_dot_
