  here s jim pinkerton talking to a baffled david corn making the case that his new boss mike huckabee can win votes from working class democrats one interesting point here is that pinkerton seems to think that non citizens and illegal immigrants refer to the same group of people _meta_end_dot_

 the other point to make of course is that while in principle i think huckabee esque populist positioning could work for the gop thus far huckabee seems to have almost no appeal outside the group of white evangelicals see e g his apparent problem with catholic voters so the problem remains pretty theoretical _meta_end_dot_

 in the _meta_number_ref_ exit polls white evangelicals were only _meta_number_ref_ percent of the population _meta_end_dot_
