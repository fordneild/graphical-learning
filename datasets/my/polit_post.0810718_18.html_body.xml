  alex rosmiller takes aim at the myth of meritocracy as it applies to the blogosphere _meta_end_dot_

 i think most of what he says he right despite the lack of barriers to entry there s still a very real sense in which things like timing and social networks are crucial to success in the political blogosphere _meta_end_dot_

 there is though one sense in which merit really does play a larger role in the blogosphere than in the dread msm _meta_end_dot_

 that is that overwhelmingly the only way for a blogger to succeed in having a lot of readers is for a lot of people relative to the modest scale of blog enterprises to genuinely find the blog worth reading _meta_end_dot_

 the msm doesn t really work that way _meta_end_dot_

 a newspaper is all bundled together _meta_end_dot_

 so as long as the new york times is worth reading which it is and bill kristol has a new york times column which he does lots of people are going to see kristol s columns _meta_end_dot_

 him keeping his job just depends on him continuing to have the favor of the nyt high command _meta_end_dot_

 and then the mere fact of his presence on the op ed page makes the columns important and worth reading for anyone who wants to participate in the conversation similarly notwithstanding the unbearable inanity of tim russert nobody can make it in big time politics without submitting to the russert probe and a russert interview with a major politician is as such a major news event worth watching _meta_end_dot_

 so meet the press can be a successful enterprise without anyone even liking it _meta_end_dot_

 the much larger number of distribution channels on the internet makes this kind of phenomenon where you become important just because someone gave you an important job is much less likely _meta_end_dot_

 good blogs can go unfairly neglected and bad blogs can become popular but popular blogs are at least well liked _meta_end_dot_

 i may not care for instapundit but instapundit s readers really do like it which is a real contrast with the typical msm situation _meta_end_dot_
