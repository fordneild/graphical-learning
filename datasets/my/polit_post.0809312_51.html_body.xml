  in case this is unclear to anyone i think muqtada al sadr was the big winner from last week s battling the iraqi government looks silly in the face of their ardent statements said joost hiltermann the deputy program director for the middle east and north africa at the international crisis group a private group that studies international conflicts _meta_end_dot_

 he said the outcome shows the iraqi military doesn t have the ability to do much of anything sadr who was in iran during the offensive came out of the confrontation stronger hiltermann said _meta_end_dot_

 he remained undefeated and he looks like the moderate he said _meta_end_dot_

 he was the one that called for his forces who were attacked to stand down that said unless you just stipulate that american interests require us to locate an iraqi leader who ll consent to america staying in iraq for _meta_number_ref_ or _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ years then i m not sure that sadr strengthening his position is such a terrible thing _meta_end_dot_

 it s bad for the bush mccain vision of perpetual war for perpetual occupation but if you think the u s _meta_end_dot_

 should be getting out of iraq then a sadr led iraq is no worse than a maliki led iraq _meta_end_dot_

 neither has a stellar human rights record of course but given the practical alternatives available sadr seems about as good as anyone else _meta_end_dot_
