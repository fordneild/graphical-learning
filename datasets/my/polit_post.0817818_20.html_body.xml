  jim henley unpacks a clich the pretended meaning is the us increased troop strength in iraq for a period of time beginning in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 the actual meaning is the us increased troop strength while ramping up a program to pay off sunni resistance leaders while iraq s warring ethno religious factions finished completely remaking iraq s demographic patterns owing to tens to hundreds of thousands of dead and millions of exiled and internally displaced while the us turned the capital into a warren of barricades _meta_end_dot_

 the net result of all those changes has been a less obtrusively violent iraq for the time being and the whole arrangement is the surge in practice but the cheerleaders talk as if it was all due to the surge in pretense _meta_end_dot_

 meanwhile iraq s calm would count as calamity almost anywhere on earth but darfur or zimbabwe _meta_end_dot_

 quite so _meta_end_dot_

 understanding the true nature of the business doesn t undermine the reality of the achievement but the achievement is to make somewhat more feasible a misguided costly and immoral scheme for imposing a semi permanent semi colonial status on iraq _meta_end_dot_

 but rather than selling the public on the whole disreputable salami we re supposed to swallow it in slices _meta_end_dot_

 first we need to give the surge a try so we can t leave this year _meta_end_dot_

 now since the surge is working we need to stay another year _meta_end_dot_

 then the year after that there ll be another reason _meta_end_dot_

 when conditions are worsening that is the reason to stay see _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ and when conditions are improving that s the reason to stay _meta_end_dot_
