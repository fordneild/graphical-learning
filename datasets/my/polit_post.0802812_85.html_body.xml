  yesterday atrios wrote yes all political junkies dream of the brokered convention _meta_end_dot_

 it would be exciting _meta_end_exclamation_

 but i started to think about how the news media would deal with such a thing if it were necessary _meta_end_dot_

 the primaries are early _meta_end_dot_

 the convention is in august _meta_end_dot_

 between the primaries and the convention the bobblehead discussion would be unbearable _meta_end_dot_

 i don t know how the campaigns themselves would deal with it _meta_end_dot_

 they couldn t go dark but they couldn t campaign as the presumptive nominee either _meta_end_dot_

 there d be calls and pressures from various quarters for one of the candidates to do the honorable thing and bow out for the sake of the party or tim russert s nantucket vacation or whatever _meta_end_dot_

 i kind of assume in part for this reason that even if the primaries don t result in anyone securing a majority of the delegates that the fight wouldn t actually go all the way to the convention _meta_end_dot_

 the answer to the question of what the campaigns do between the primaries and the convention is that they d be brokering with all their might and most likely something would emerge _meta_end_dot_

 after all what does anyone else have to do _meta_end_question_
