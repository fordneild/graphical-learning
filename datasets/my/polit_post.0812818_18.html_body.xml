  i m no longer convinced that john mccain should make a one term pledge _meta_end_dot_

 after all as commenters to the previous post argued there are other ways to make tmbg relevant to the mccain campaign _meta_end_dot_

 consider for example purple toupee which i think he should use as a theme song _meta_end_dot_

 first mccain s desire to see heightened china taiwan tensions in order to prompt a new cold war and inflate his own sense of self importance chinese people were fighting in the park martin x was mad when they outlawed bell bottoms i shouted out free the expo _meta_number_ref_ now i m very big i m a big important man and more broadly a an anachronistic authoritarian streak purple toupee is here to stay after the hair has gone away we have an obligation don t say you weren t warned _meta_end_dot_
