  joejoejoe asks you must have had a subscription to what if _meta_end_question_

 comics when you were a kid _meta_end_dot_

 you sure do love counterfactuals _meta_end_dot_

 maybe british colonialism would have done for north america what it did for africa _meta_end_question_

 maybe the united states in the latter part of the _meta_number_ref_th century more like south africa than canada _meta_end_dot_

 maybe if the american revolution happens in _meta_number_ref_ instead of _meta_number_ref_ we find ourselves allied with german nationalists in the late _meta_number_ref_s _meta_end_dot_

 maybe in the _meta_number_ref_th century isiah thomas will be viewed as the best knicks gm in history _meta_end_dot_

 assignment desk explain the value of counterfactuals and your affection for them _meta_end_dot_

 my affection for counterfactuals and my sense of their value derives from when i took richard heck s class on realism and anti realism and we did a unit on counterfactuals _meta_end_dot_

 for that segment of the class we were assigned david lewis on the plurality of worlds where i was first exposed to the argument much less controversial than lewis conclusions about the metaphysical status of modal claims that there s an intimate link between talk about causation and talk about counterfactuals _meta_end_dot_

 my thoughts on this matter were further influenced by when i took the final course robert nozick ever taught which was on the philosophy of history some of nozick s thoughts on the matter are reflected in invariances _meta_end_dot_

 at any rate among historians talk of counterfactuals is in a bad air _meta_end_dot_

 but philosophers generally find it pretty uncontroversial to say that modulo certain complications causal claims can generally be translated into causal claims _meta_end_dot_

 so you might say that the casey v _meta_end_dot_

 planned parenthood opinion came out the way it did because david souter turned out to be a moderate rather than a conservative replacement for william brennan _meta_end_dot_

 alternatively you might say if souter had turned out to be as conservative as ted kennedy feared the casey decisions would have gutted constitutional protection of abortion rights now you can t say these things are precisely the same because maybe souter would have been a wingnut who got run over by a bus the day after his confirmation etc _meta_end_dot_

 etc _meta_end_dot_

 etc _meta_end_dot_

 but in a commonsense way the what if question is just a vivid way of thinking about causal claims _meta_end_dot_
