  several weeks ago a colleague turned me on to david freedman s _meta_number_ref_ second time out blog about the nba _meta_end_dot_

 i don t really agree with all the themes freedman develops but one very solid point he s been making is that despite greg popovich s sterling reputation and solid track record of success his love of hack a x plays whether x is shaw or tyson chandler or whomever doesn t make a great deal of sense _meta_end_dot_

 to get it down to cold hard math the nba s top team in terms of offensive efficiency this year phoenix scored _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ points per possession _meta_end_dot_

 even if you assume no chance of offensive rebound that s equivalent to giving up two shots to a _meta_number_ref_ percent free throw shooter _meta_end_dot_

 and that s the average for the best offense in the league _meta_end_dot_

 san antonio only gives up _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ points on its average possession which is equivalent again wrongly ignoring the possibility of an offensive rebound to giving up two free throws to a _meta_number_ref_ percent free throw shooter _meta_end_dot_

 in general bad as guys like shaq and chandler are at shooting free throws for either of them two free shots is still a more efficient than average offensive possession _meta_end_dot_

 as i say popovich s love of this tactic is unusually odd since the spurs are a very good defensive team _meta_end_dot_

 the wizards by contrast are a not so hot defense that was at times facing off against ben wallace who s even worse than shaq or chandler creating a situation where hack a ben really might have been a good idea _meta_end_dot_
