  alissa rubin and damien cave of the new york times take a good hard look at the sunni awakening strategy and how shockingly enough a policy of handing out cash training and guns to whoever s willing to work with us could wind up backfiring how when thousands are joining each month can spies and extremists be reliably weeded out _meta_end_question_

 how can the men s loyalty be maintained given their tribal and sectarian ties and in many cases their insurgent pasts _meta_end_question_

 and crucially how can the movement be sustained once the americans turn over control to a shiite dominated government that has been wary and sometimes hostile toward the groups _meta_end_question_

 despite the successes of the movement including the members ability to provide valuable intelligence and give rebuilding efforts a new chance in war shattered communities the american military acknowledges that it is also a high risk proposition _meta_end_dot_

 it is an experiment in counterinsurgency warfare that could contain the seeds of a civil war in which if the worst fears come true the united states would have helped organize some of the sunni forces arrayed against the central government on which so many american lives and dollars have been spent _meta_end_dot_

 yes right exactly _meta_end_dot_

 in a society full of rival armed factions contending for power you can t achieve peace by just building opportunistic alliances with a whole bunch of separate factions _meta_end_dot_

 if our commanders and troops are nimble enough and they very well might be as they ve demonstrated a good deal of nimbleness recently they may be able to keep playing this dangerous game and keeping the us deployment viable but it doesn t really achieve anything _meta_end_dot_

 achieve anything that is beyond a welcome reduction in american casualites _meta_end_dot_

 but going home would reduce casualties further faster and cheaper _meta_end_dot_
