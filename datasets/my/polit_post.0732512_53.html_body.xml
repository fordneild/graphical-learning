  speaking of the crime issue i should say that while i think the united states has gotten unduly complacent about crime since the big crime drop of the _meta_number_ref_s _meta_end_dot_

 there s no reason we shouldn t be able to get the murder rate back down to _meta_number_ref_s levels if we try and i think there s pretty good reason to believe that sustained further reductions in crime levels can help create a situation where our ludicrously high prison population can start coming down _meta_end_dot_

 what s more i think we actually learned a lot during the _meta_number_ref_s and _meta_number_ref_s about effective crime control strategies _meta_end_dot_

 mcmegan waxes vague on the other hand culture matters doesn t get you very far as a poverty eradication program no matter how much money you give welfare mothers they ll still be on welfare _meta_end_dot_

 and they re poor has proven to offer little in the way of crime reduction strategies we ve been much more successful with things like more police on the beat _meta_end_dot_

 and indeed there is good evidence that more police officers helps reduce crime _meta_end_dot_

 what s more though i really really really don t think rudy giuliani should be elected president the compstat system he and william bratton implemented appears to be a helpful way of deploying the cops you have more effectively _meta_end_dot_

 and indeed bratton is currently following up his successful runs in boston and nyc with successes in los angeles and all this presumably has something to do with his methods i e things that can be copied rather than with his batman style crime fighting abilities _meta_end_dot_

 what s more as i somewhat reluctantly concede in this article mass incarceration though cruel and expensive is somewhat effective as a crime control strategy _meta_end_dot_

 meanwhile another big part of the _meta_number_ref_s story is that while welfare handouts may not reduce crime this is a bit unclear since welfare goes overwhelmingly to women and crime is committed overwhelmingly by men the gender gap also being a good reason to doubt that objective material need is the key variable here wages for unskilled workers are an important determinant of crime rates in a way that s pretty intuitive if there s more money to be made working you re ceteris paribus more likely to spend time working and when you re behind the desk at cvs you re by definition not robbing anyone _meta_end_dot_

 relatedly while i don t really believe that improved educational attainment is the key factor in curbing inequality better performance at the bottom end fewer high school drop outs in particular could do a lot to reduce crime _meta_end_dot_

 similarly high intensity early childhood interventions seem to work _meta_end_dot_

 last while we spend a fortune on locking people up in prison we also have all these parolees who are being supervised in a very bare bones and largely useless manner _meta_end_dot_

 something more expensive than traditional parole something like coerced abstinence would be way cheaper than full time incarceration but way more effective than what we re doing now _meta_end_dot_
