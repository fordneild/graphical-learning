  john mccain speaking in jordan reveals that he has no idea what s happening in iraq speaking to reporters in amman the jordanian capital mccain said he and two senate colleagues traveling with him continue to be concerned about iranian operatives taking al qaeda into iran training them and sending them back pressed to elaborate mccain said it was common knowledge and has been reported in the media that al qaeda is going back into iran and receiving training and are coming back into iraq from iran that s well known _meta_end_dot_

 and it s unfortunate a few moments later sen _meta_end_dot_

 joseph lieberman standing just behind mccain stepped forward and whispered in the presidential candidate s ear _meta_end_dot_

 mccain then said i m sorry the iranians are training extremists not al qaeda the mistake threatened to undermine mccain s argument that his decades of foreign policy experience make him the natural choice to lead a country at war with terrorists _meta_end_dot_

 in recent days mccain has repeatedly said his intimate knowledge of foreign policy make him the best equipped to answer a phone ringing in the white house late at night _meta_end_dot_

 of course this isn t just an issue of mccain blowing some trivia answer it seems to call into question whether he s really been paying attention to the iraq issue over the past couple of years _meta_end_dot_

 he s very sure that the surge is working but doesn t understand the basic contours of the ongoing conflicts in iraq _meta_end_question_

 seems strange _meta_end_dot_
