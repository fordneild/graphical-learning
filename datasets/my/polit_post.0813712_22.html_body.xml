  like robert farley i have my doubts but here s my question why would clinton want to be vice president _meta_end_question_

 wouldn t senate majority leader and i suspect this could be arranged be a more powerful position _meta_end_question_

 wouldn t she have more influence over policymaking there than in the vice president s office _meta_end_question_

 i mean this question in all seriousness clinton seems to be indicating that she d like the spot but i m befuddled as to why she d take it much less fight for it _meta_end_dot_

 i suppose that it sets her up for another run in _meta_number_ref_ or perhaps more importantly precludes the emergence of a vice presidential rival that year but marginal improvement on her chances in eight years would seem small recompense for the powerlessness of the vp slot _meta_end_dot_

 let s remember that vice presidents have exactly as much power as the president gives them and if it s true that obama really doesn t want hillary and i wouldn t credit such assertions too heavily at this point then he certainly isn t likely to grant her much power in his administration _meta_end_dot_

 i don t think her odds at the senate leadership are really all that good too much fighting with obama endorsing senior members at this point but certainly if i were hillary clinton i would want nothing to do with the vice presidency _meta_end_dot_

 if obama becomes president she s an unusually high profile senator for as long as she wants to be one whose national following and large donor base can let her exercise a lot of influence in congress _meta_end_dot_

 and if obama loses to john mccain she can run again in _meta_number_ref_ and say she told us so _meta_end_dot_

 my suspicion is that hints from the clinton camp of interest in a unity ticket have more to do with the desires of the campaign staff for a better crack at executive branch jobs in an obama administration _meta_end_dot_

 after all hillary has a solid fallback job as a senator that s not true for everyone on the team _meta_end_dot_
