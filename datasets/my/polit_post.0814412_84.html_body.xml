  brendan nyhan says that the early state by state polling actually does have some predictive value but that the important caveat to this is that the toss up states are genuinely toss ups _meta_end_dot_

 tom holbrook did an analysis comparing _meta_number_ref_ presidential election outcomes to polling in spring _meta_number_ref_ and found that across all four months march june the poll result called the wrong winner in _meta_number_ref_ of the _meta_number_ref_ cases in which kerry s share of the two party vote in trial heat polls was between _meta_percent_ref_ and _meta_percent_ref_ this excludes two cases in which the poll result was tied to me at the end of the day this essentially reenforces the idea that early polling isn t very valuable _meta_end_dot_

 we don t need a poll to tell us that john mccain s going to win utah and barack obama s going to win florida _meta_end_dot_

 we do need a poll to tell us obama s narrowly ahead in colorado and mccain s not a slight edge in nevada but those polls are too close to be predictive _meta_end_dot_

 we also know that forecasts based on the fundamentals suggest that obama will likely win the popular vote _meta_end_dot_
