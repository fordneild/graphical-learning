  the primary s been making it hard for me to follow the nba as closely as i d like but wtf is happening with my wizards _meta_end_dot_

 first we beat boston _meta_end_dot_

 then we beat boston again _meta_end_dot_

 then we _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 lose to the knicks _meta_end_dot_

 i ve got tickets to tomorrow s rematch and i d had it marked down in my calendar as a definite win _meta_end_dot_

 now who knows _meta_end_question_

 meanwhile i m trying to puzzle together whether or not there s any reason to worry that an eventual return of agent zero might harm the team s improved defense _meta_end_dot_

 it s possible that the daniels arenas backcourt that eddie jordan liked to use pretty often is just super weak _meta_end_dot_

 deshawn stevenson rarely looks impressive to me but the plus minus stats indicate that he s contributing on defense _meta_end_dot_
