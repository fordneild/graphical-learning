  it was striking to me that during the pregame coverage of the pistons suns matchup yesterday none of the commentators seemed to be acknowledging the basic point that the marion shaq deal was a risky and controversial move _meta_end_dot_

 instead it was being covered in a totally rah rah as if it were a gasol style no brainer _meta_end_dot_

 obviously many people do think it was a smart move for phoenix to make but surely the commentary ought to reflect the fact that a lot of people think it was a blunder _meta_end_dot_

 the upshot naturally enough was that phoenix got blown out _meta_end_dot_

 sample size is obviously far too small to make big hay out of the team going _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ since the trade and those were all good teams but still _meta_end_dot_

 it s certainly strange though that the phoenix defense is so up and down bracketing that great performance against boston by giving up _meta_number_ref_ points to la and _meta_number_ref_ to detroit _meta_end_dot_
