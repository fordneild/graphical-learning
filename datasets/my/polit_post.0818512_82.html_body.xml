  david broder i have not worried about the fundamental commitment of the american people since _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 in that year they were confronted with the stunning evidence that their president had conducted a criminal conspiracy out of the oval office _meta_end_dot_

 in response the american people reminded richard nixon the man they had just recently reelected overwhelmingly that in this country no one not even the president is above the law _meta_end_dot_

 they required him to yield his office _meta_end_dot_

 that is not the sign of a nation that has lost its sense of values or forgotten the principles on which this system rests _meta_end_dot_

 and yet here we are in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 and i don t think anyone can seriously dispute that the current president of the united states violated the foreign intelligence surveillance act or any number of legal commitments to refrain from torture _meta_end_dot_

 some people think these violations were good policy _meta_end_dot_

 many of those who regard those violations as good policy also maintain that higher constitutional principles grant the president the right to break the law _meta_end_dot_

 which is precisely what you could say on behalf of richard nixon _meta_end_dot_

 and bush like nixon has become unpopular _meta_end_dot_

 but bush won t be hounded out of office _meta_end_dot_

 i m not exactly sure what accounts for the difference _meta_end_dot_

 i wasn t alive in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 i have a vague sense that at that time america s elites operated with some sense of conscience and dignity and it was taken for granted even among republican leaders that one couldn t just break the law _meta_end_dot_

 these days a misleading deposition taken in the course of a frivolous lawsuit aimed at avoiding the revelation of an affair is a grave national crisis but it s taken for granted that only a lunatic would believe that bush or any of his henchmen should be held accountable in any way for repeated violations of the law _meta_end_dot_

 i don t really know what changed or why david broder and other gatekeepers of elite consensus can t see that something s gone wrong here but i m not happy about it _meta_end_dot_
