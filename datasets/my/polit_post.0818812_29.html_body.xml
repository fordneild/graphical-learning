  good description from megan mcardle aspen is a monumental shrine to wealth clothed in the false modesty of a self conscious homage to america s small town past _meta_end_dot_

 it is the potemkin village of the post consumer culture _meta_end_dot_

 the place always puts me in mind of the american restaurants abroad it looks like a diner and the menu sounds like a diner but when the food comes the chili cheesedog is made with bratwurst and limburger and they ve slathered your french fries with mayonnaise _meta_end_dot_

 but the mountains are really beautiful _meta_end_dot_

 of course with american restaurants you never know _meta_end_dot_

 back in _meta_number_ref_ at least buffalo bill s in prague was serviceable tex mex at a time when the czech republic was not offering a ton of edible cuisine _meta_end_dot_

 eleven years later i imagine things are very different though _meta_end_dot_
