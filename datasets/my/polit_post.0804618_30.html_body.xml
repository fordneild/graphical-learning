  according to walter pincus the us government is paying less attention to the safety and security of our nuclear arsenals _meta_end_dot_

 that doesn t seem very smart to me at all _meta_end_dot_

 robert farley points out that in addition to the direct costs the presence of weak safety procedures in the u s _meta_end_dot_

 makes it harder to get other nations to take such procedures seriously especially those such as russia india and pakistan which run a much more serious risk of a nuclear accident it s really pretty hard for me to think of things more worth paying attention to than the safety and security of our own nuclear weapons _meta_end_dot_

 this shouldn t be a difficult problem for a rich country with a lavishly financed defense establishment _meta_end_dot_
