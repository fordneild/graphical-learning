  clifford levy had a fantastic piece in yesterday s new york times giving a granular micro level account of vladimir putin s takeover of nizhny novgorod formerly the political home base of boris nemtsov who s now a leading figure in the anti putin opposition _meta_end_dot_

 this was of particular interest to me because i spent the summer of _meta_number_ref_ living in the city in question _meta_end_dot_

 and here s the one area where i feel a lot of this kind of reporting on putin s authoritarianism falls down _meta_end_dot_

 i never met anyone in _meta_number_ref_ vintage nizhny novgorod who was really excited about the state of russian politics _meta_end_dot_

 the general feeling was that rather than democracy they were suffering from a regime of chaos and corruption _meta_end_dot_

 people would talk openly about their yearning for a strong leader who could restore order and prosperity singapore pinochet s chile postwar south korea those were the models on people s lips _meta_end_dot_

 and this i think is more or less what most people think they ve gotten from putin _meta_end_dot_

 in reality it s almost certainly the case that russian prosperity is founded on the current high price of fossile fuels the oil crisis years were very kind to the soviet consumer rather than on anything putin s done but that s how it s seen _meta_end_dot_

 i think that s the context you need for levy s stories _meta_end_dot_

 the kind of tactics putin used to consolidate control would never have worked if russia had featured real liberal political parties with meaningful mass support _meta_end_dot_

 but by the time boris yeltsin put him in power the screw ups deprivation and corruption of the previous years combined with the sense that russia s position on the world stage was slipping had badly hollowed out support for liberalism at non elite levels _meta_end_dot_
