  it seems that over the weekend mike huckabee made the following remark about the fact that it s not really possible for him to beat john mccain at this point no matter how many primaries he won the pundits say the math doesn t work out _meta_end_dot_

 well folks i didn t major in math _meta_end_dot_

 i majored in miracles _meta_end_dot_

 this raises some serious questions about huckabee s philosophy _meta_end_dot_

 normally the truths of mathematics are regarded as necessary truths and one way of explaining that idea is that these are truths that even god couldn t alter _meta_end_dot_

 for example it s true that all squares have four sides because having four sides is part of what it means to be a square _meta_end_dot_

 god could make pretty much any kind of five sided object he cared to but even he couldn t make a five sided square because something with five sides just isn t a square _meta_end_dot_

 this basic tension between god and math is surely something a minister should be familiar with _meta_end_dot_

 alternatively perhaps huckabee was suggest not a miraculous repeal of the mathematical certainty of his defeat but rather a form of divine intervention that would make the delegate math irrelevant _meta_end_dot_

 it s difficult however to see what that could be except for the possibility that mccain might die or suffer some kind of illness or injury that prevents him from accepting the nomination _meta_end_dot_

 that doesn t however seem like a very christian thing to wish for _meta_end_dot_

 nor i might add is there any real reason to think that even mccain s untimely death would deliver the nomination to huckabee _meta_end_dot_
