  via brendan nyhan former bush communications director dan bartlett gives his views on the political press tm do you think the press corps is responsible for putting that word out that the president was lying about weapons of mass destruction in iraq _meta_end_question_

 bartlett i don t think they re purposely doing it _meta_end_dot_

 look i get asked the question all the time how do you deal with them when they re all liberal _meta_end_question_

 i ve found that most of them are not ideologically driven _meta_end_dot_

 do i think that a lot of them don t agree with the president _meta_end_question_

 no doubt about it _meta_end_dot_

 but impact above all else is what matters _meta_end_dot_

 all they re worried about is can i have the front page byline _meta_end_question_

 can i lead the evening newscast _meta_end_question_

 and unfortunately that requires them to not do in depth studies about president bush s health care plan or no child left behind _meta_end_dot_

 it s who s up who s down cheney hates condi condi hates cheney _meta_end_dot_

 this seems like a shockingly reasonable assessment of the situation _meta_end_dot_

 one might add that a huge amount of the problem is lock in _meta_end_dot_

 if the incentives facing the people who do this kind of coverage point in the direction of pointless dumb stories then people who are strongly averse to doing that kind of work tend to get out of the business _meta_end_dot_

 those who succeed are the ones who not only understand the incentive structure but who embrace it thus further re inscribing it _meta_end_dot_
