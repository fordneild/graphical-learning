  house minority leader john boehner says that because of the democrats inaction the protect america act expired last night at midnight forcing our intelligence officials to revert to the same terror surveillance laws that failed to protect america from the al qaeda terrorist attack on _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ as tim lee points out this is just an extravagantly false claim _meta_end_dot_

 back in october of _meta_number_ref_ president bush gave a radio address about how the bill i signed yesterday gives intelligence and law enforcement officials additional tools they need to hunt and capture and punish terrorists the fisa was revised again in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 then fisa was revised again in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 then fisa was revised again in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 protect america act aside there have been four separate post _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ sets of modifications to the law in question _meta_end_dot_

 most people don t know this fair enough _meta_end_dot_

 but boehner s been in congress throughout all of this he voted on the revisions and now he s pretending they don t exist _meta_end_dot_
