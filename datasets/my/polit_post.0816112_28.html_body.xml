  ari melber on diversity in the opinion section the most traditional location to reach the political establishment the washington post opinion section is brazenly male dominated _meta_end_dot_

 seventeen of the _meta_number_ref_ columnists are men only three of the columnists are racial minorities _meta_end_dot_

 guest op eds could present more voices but they rarely do _meta_end_dot_

 this year only _meta_number_ref_ percent of the post s guest pieces came from women according to a may count by ombudsman deborah howell _meta_end_dot_

 at the new york times eight of the ten weekly columnists are men one is black _meta_end_dot_

 i d say this is especially egregious with regard to the op ed pieces _meta_end_dot_

 the major papers seem to pride themselves on the glacial pace of turnover and total lack of quality control with regard to their regular columnists which limits one s ability to diversify with speed _meta_end_dot_

 but all it would take to dramatically increase the number of women having op eds published in the washington post would be to email some women who write about politics and say want to write something for the washington post i m sure someone would say yes _meta_end_dot_
