  to echo ilan goldenberg and shawn brimley i think it would be a disaster for the next president to appoint a republican as secretary of defense _meta_end_dot_

 the symbolism a combination of democrats can t handle defense and democrats don t care about defense just sucks _meta_end_dot_

 in general i m not so high on the idea of appointing republicans to anything but you especially want to keep them away from the national security realm _meta_end_dot_

 now it s a different matter to give an appointment to someone who s an ex republican or willing to become one _meta_end_dot_

 actual party switchers who are willing to publicly articulate a narrative about switching are a valuable commodity and people like that should be shoved out in front of the camera whenever it s plausible to do so _meta_end_dot_
