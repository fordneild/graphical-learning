  back during the primaries everyone kept formally admitting that it was wrong to engage in the form of inference candidate x lost group a in a primary and therefore he s likely to lose group a in a general election against candidate y of the other party but i often got the sense listening to and reading pundits that they didn t really believe that _meta_end_dot_

 but the pew center s latest findings on public opinion among hispanics should remind people that this is a very important caveat _meta_end_dot_

 barack obama did quite a poor job of persuading latinos to vote for him over hillary clinton but they re backing him very strongly against john mccain _meta_end_dot_

 the numbers deserve to be put in a historical context obama is in short in solid shape with this demographic _meta_end_dot_

 which i hope will serve as a reminder for us next time _meta_end_dot_

 the way a lot of people were interpreting the obama clinton primary results led to the conclusion that neither candidate could beat john mccain because both were showing weakness among some key groups even though both were polling ahead of mccain in general election trial heats at the time _meta_end_dot_

 but the weakness of both candidates simply reflected the fact that they were evenly matched with about half of democrats preferring each of their choices it didn t say anything about either candidate s actual strength in november _meta_end_dot_
