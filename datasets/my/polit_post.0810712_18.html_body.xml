  every liberal i know in dc is busy warning every other liberal i know in dc that liberals are too overconfident of our chances in november direly issuing statements about john mccain s strengths as a candidate and barack obama s fatal weaknesses _meta_end_dot_

 john judis has always led the charge of pessimism but near as i can tell the alleged overconfident attitude doesn t have any adherents and the everyone is being overconfident view is actually universal and utterly dominant _meta_end_dot_

 i ll stand up for overconfidence _meta_end_dot_

 elections are mostly determined by the fundamentals and the fundamentals are against mccain _meta_end_dot_

 on top of that democrats have the more charismatic nominee _meta_end_dot_

 i look at national polling that shows obama in a _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ tie with mccain which is a very bad result for a de facto incumbent and a terrible result for someone facing such a favorable campaign dynamic _meta_end_dot_

 we are right now at this very moment witnessing the peak of mccain s electoral stock a time when hillary clinton is beating up obama on a daily basis and virtually no americans have been exposed to the democrats anti mccain messaging _meta_end_dot_

 anything can happen in principle but if someone forced you to make an even odds bet on the outcome of this election i don t think there can be any serious debate about what the smart play is _meta_end_dot_
