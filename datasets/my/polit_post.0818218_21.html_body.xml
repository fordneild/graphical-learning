  so as it turns out my flight had directtv on it and i did get to see barack obama s speech on patriotism after all _meta_end_dot_

 i thought it was a little bit lame and defensive frankly though certainly not nearly as lame as the campaign s decision to hang wes clark out to dry for making a clearly true observation _meta_end_dot_

 all that said i read at the end of last week that mccain had won the week and i read the same thing after the week before that and yet despite all these winning weeks mccain is losing the election by a comfortable margin _meta_end_dot_

 and on some level i think this accounts for some of the lameness of the obama campaign which i m now recalling had a marked tendency to lapse into prolonged stretches of lameness during the primary only to raise it game at moments when hillary clinton s attacks seemed to be getting traction _meta_end_dot_

 the organizational elements field and fundraising were brilliant throughout but on the messaging level it was kind of a judo campaign that only really looked good when it looked like they were about to get buried _meta_end_dot_

 right now mccain s flailing around and not getting traction with anything and obama seems to have retreated into a super cautious mode just focused on parrying mccain s feeble blows _meta_end_dot_
