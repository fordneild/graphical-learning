  one of the odd manifestations of america s new enthusiasm for imperialism is i suppose that the capital is now full of gossip and intrigue regarding which generals will be assigned to which posts _meta_end_dot_

 meanwhile because of the way these terms play out it s worth noting that dealing with the inherited brass is would be a substantial challenge for a new democratic president _meta_end_dot_

 since these are theoretically apolitical jobs a new president can t just come in and clean house _meta_end_dot_

 but since the bush administration will have been in charge for eight years most of which have been occupied by a politically controversial war many top generals are now de facto political figures _meta_end_dot_

 if whoever s running centcom and this may well be general petraeus of mnf iraq or both in january _meta_number_ref_ disagrees with the new president s preferred iraq policy those people will be in a position to make life awkward for the new president _meta_end_dot_

 this is a concrete area where i do put some stock in the clinton experience argument as she seems less likely to get rolled though at the same time i have more doubts that her policy judgment would be the same as mine _meta_end_dot_
