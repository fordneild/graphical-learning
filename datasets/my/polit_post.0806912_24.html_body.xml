  you can tell that i ve officially jumped the shark since there s an article in the new york times style section about how my roommates and i all have blogs and are friends with other political bloggers _meta_end_dot_

 the good news is that while i was afraid intrepid reporter ashley parker would try to compensate for the fact that we re not very interesting by being really mean she seems to have resisted the temptation _meta_end_dot_

 plus i really like the photo michael temchine took that i stole above and they used with the article _meta_end_dot_

 do people care about this stuff _meta_end_question_

 probably someone does and whoever that is probably isn t you the kind of person who s reading blogs on a sunday _meta_end_dot_

 instead you my readers are going to make fun of me _meta_end_dot_

 and that s fine _meta_end_dot_

 mock all you like _meta_end_dot_

 but if you don t pre order a copy of heads in the sand i ll cry _meta_end_dot_
