  this map accompanies matt miller s article on education policy in the january february issue of the atlantic that i thought i should recommend before march issue madness overtakes the site _meta_end_dot_

 it highlights the incredibly large disparities in school funding that exist in our fine nation _meta_end_dot_

 these huge gaps are hardly the be all and end all of our education problems in the united states but they re hard to justify _meta_end_dot_

 it s just as important to educate children in alabama as it is to educate them in massachusetts but kids in the latter state get double the money of kids in the former _meta_end_dot_

 miller s article isn t even primarily about money _meta_end_dot_

 instead it s about the fact that these general institutional issue persists throughout our educational system things are wildly different from district to district and especially from state to state _meta_end_dot_

 that s the american tradition of local control at work _meta_end_dot_

 but while this is very much our tradition it s not a very good one _meta_end_dot_

 it doesn t really make sense to have the standard of what counts as reading proficiency to be different in massachusetts than it is in alabama _meta_end_dot_

 nor of course do american families live hermetically sealed locally controlled lives kids move from district to district or state to state all the time _meta_end_dot_

 few other countries do things the american way and they re generally getting better results _meta_end_dot_

 it s time for us to change _meta_end_dot_

 but don t listen to me read miller s article _meta_end_dot_

 one thing i d add though is that the goofy primary system is a large obstacle to reform here _meta_end_dot_

 iowa and new hampshire happen to be two of the most fanatical local control states out there and everyone tailors their education policy to accord with sensibilities in those places _meta_end_dot_
