  i doubt anyone s surprised that scott skiles got fired but doing it on christmas eve just seems mean _meta_end_dot_

 what s more the team was actually improving they started _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ and they re _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ now so the new coach may well wind up getting credit for an improvement that was already happening _meta_end_dot_

 meanwhile john paxson might want to consider firing himself _meta_end_dot_

 i supported the ben wallace signing at the time but it obviously hasn t worked out very well _meta_end_dot_

 but trading away tyson chandler for nothing never made sense on any level _meta_end_dot_

 then i ve never heard of a team flirting with so many deals to acquire a superstar and then come away with nothing _meta_end_dot_
