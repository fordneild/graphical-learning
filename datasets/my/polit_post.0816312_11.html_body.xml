  the mccain campaign is evidently convinced that it can win a debate about iraq policy but the basis for their confidence remains elusive _meta_end_dot_

 here s a democracy corps analysis of _meta_number_ref_ republican held but maybe winnable congressional districts more importantly when forced to choose between obama s proposal for a responsible troop withdrawal and a shift of resources to the u s _meta_end_dot_

 and mccain s commitment to stay the course but have most troops out of iraq by _meta_number_ref_ democrats win the argument by double digit margins _meta_end_dot_

 engaging in the iraq debate allows democrats to reach out to independents and winnable voters well beyond their electoral support _meta_end_dot_

 given that this is a somewhat right of center set of districts that s very very bad news for mccain _meta_end_dot_

 under the circumstances insofar as mccain s heavy recent focus on learn from joe biden s confidence and recognize that there s nothing to be afraid of _meta_end_dot_
