  i d like to revisit the false populism issue from bush s state of the union address the other night _meta_end_dot_

 obviously the colombia free trade pact is hardly the most important thing in the world colombia s just too small for this to make a big impact on the us economy one way or the other but the claim that if we fail to pass this agreement we will embolden the purveyors of false populism in our hemisphere is an excellent example of the complete lack of strategic thought that characterizes this administration _meta_end_dot_

 james poulos like me didn t understand how hugo chavez would be emboldened by our failure to ratify the agreement _meta_end_dot_

 daniel larison explains it s like this james if you push for more neoliberal policies in latin america that will magically reduce the popularity of the false populism that has flourished on account of the backlash against the last round of neoliberal policies pushed by washington whereas if you don t support those policies false populism will run wild _meta_end_dot_

 that s clear isn t it _meta_end_question_

 that s really it though _meta_end_dot_

 in bush world first you set out to do something _meta_end_dot_

 then if that thing seems to not be working out or causing problems what you need to do is do it again harder _meta_end_dot_

 anything else after all would only embolden the bad guys _meta_end_dot_

 it s that simple and it s that dumb _meta_end_dot_
