  i was looking for some background on yesterday s ludicrous op ed from fred kagan and michael o hanlon about how we need to prepare to invade pakistan and i found this charles knight blog post from the spring _meta_end_dot_

 the post noted that kagan and o hanlon collaborated on an essay for this book from the stanley foundation a collection of papers where one republican and one democrat team up to write something about us national security policy _meta_end_dot_

 well what pollack and o hanlon came up with was the need for a dramatic expansion in america s ground forces _meta_end_dot_

 and it turns out that one of the scenarios they canvassed to justify this troop build up was precisely this sort of stabilization mission in pakistan _meta_end_dot_

 mostly this goes to show how senseless it is to make bridging the partisan divide as such a goal of an intervention into the american political debate _meta_end_dot_

 there are lots of people with republican party backgrounds who have sensible things to say about aspects of us national security policy and a person like steve clemons at new america who s gone to great lengths to try to find such people and get them networked with the progressives who ve been leading the pushback against the bush administration is a very valuable endeavor _meta_end_dot_

 but a fred kagan o hanlon teamup just like this teamup of ivo daalder and robert kagan makes things worth rather than better _meta_end_dot_

 a bad idea doesn t become better just because you can find some democrat somewhere who supports it _meta_end_dot_
