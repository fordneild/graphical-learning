  if you only buy one foreign policy book this year it should obviously be heads in the sand by a talented young writer with whom i m acquainted _meta_end_dot_

 but if you buy a second you could do a lot worse than a j _meta_end_dot_

 rosmiller s still broken a recruit s inside account of intelligence failure from baghdad to the pentagon _meta_end_dot_

 you ve got some memoir some policy analysis and even a touch of action adventure thrills _meta_end_dot_

 it shows on both a micro and a macro level in what bad shape we are intelligence wise _meta_end_dot_

 the system doesn t work and good intelligence product isn t getting into the right hands and being acted on in the right way _meta_end_dot_

 but what s more the system s driving smart talented patriotic and knowledgeable people right out of the system _meta_end_dot_

 aj s writing books and blog posts and going to law school instead of still working in the ic in part because it s the kind of screwed up place that s driving the best people away rather than pulling them in _meta_end_dot_

 so to repeat pre order heads in the sand but it won t come for a while so while you wait pick up a copy of still broken available tuesday and read that _meta_end_dot_
