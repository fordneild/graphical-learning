  to return to john mccain s _meta_number_ref_ years war remarks it s worth considering what this says about him as a potential commander in chief george w _meta_end_dot_

 bush i think most people can agree has a tendency toward the cavalier and irresponsible _meta_end_dot_

 liberal critics such as myself also tend to view his strategy in iraq as aimed at a perpetual occupation of that country _meta_end_dot_

 nevertheless not even george w _meta_end_dot_

 bush is nearly so cavalier and irresponsible as to make the kind of remarks mccain is saying here _meta_end_dot_

 bush it seems has advisors who know something about the diplomatic situation _meta_end_dot_

 bush has even spoken personally with heads of state and other officials throughout the arab world _meta_end_dot_

 bush in short recklessless and immature though he may be still knows that it plays very very very poorly in the arab world for american leaders to run around talking about _meta_number_ref_ year occupations of iraq _meta_end_dot_
