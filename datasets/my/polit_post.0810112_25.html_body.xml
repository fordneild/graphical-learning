  the new york times would like us to believe that though john mccain thought we should mount a land invasion of serbia in _meta_number_ref_ argued for a policy of rogue state rollback in _meta_number_ref_ chaperoned ahmed chalabi around town for years began beating the drums for an invasion of iraq in _meta_number_ref_ and has threatened war with north korea and iran that he s really torn between two factions of advisors hawkish neocons and more sensible realists _meta_end_dot_

 one problem with this theory is mccain s record _meta_end_dot_

 as mccain likes to note he has a lot of experience national security issues he s not some obscure governor being tutored by some eminences grises and his record shows that sometime in the _meta_number_ref_s he swung to become the most consistently aggressive hawk in the u s _meta_end_dot_

 senate _meta_end_dot_

 another problem is that as justin logan points out all the realists and pragmatists the times can find are iraq war supporters just like their neocon antagonists _meta_end_dot_

 i would add that a further problem is that again when you re talking about a guy like mccain who s been engaged with these issues a while it s worth looking beyond the circle of foreign policy dudes who ve given mccain an official endorsement to seeing who he s actually hired _meta_end_dot_

 if you ll look you ll find that mccain senate and campaign staffs both contain a ton of people whose resumes include stints at the weekly standard and or the project for a new american century that s the network he s tied into _meta_end_dot_
