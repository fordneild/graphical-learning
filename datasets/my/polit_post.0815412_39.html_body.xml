  one point i ve been trying to make in my book talks is that there s precious little evidence that public opinion is demanding a neo imperial foreign policy for the united states _meta_end_dot_

 nobody felt during the _meta_number_ref_ presidential campaign that the public was clamoring for a new orwellian doctrine of anticipatory self defense to repeat the phrase used in doug feith s book in which the united states was going to launch aggressive wars against countries that hadn t attacked us or our allies and had no plans of doing so _meta_end_dot_

 september _meta_number_ref_ clearly had a large impact on public opinion but even then there was little public interest in doing this which is why the bush administration overstated both the scale and the immediacy of the alleged iraqi threat while drastically downplaying the costs _meta_end_dot_

 and you see again that while it took a certain amount of courage for barack obama to stand up to the crusted over notion that the united states should set itself up as too damn important to conduct high level talks with regional adversaries there s not some genuine avalanche of public opinion on the other side of this issue _meta_end_dot_

 what you have instead is a political and media system that s very vulnerable to hype fearmongering hysteria etc _meta_end_dot_

 but calm political leadership that doesn t panic at the first sign of conservative self confidence about the politics of warmongering has a real chance to win these fights _meta_end_dot_
