  nicholas kristof says he used to be for legalizing prostitution but changed his mind after learning more about conditions in the netherlands and now favors something more like sweden s approach _meta_end_dot_

 i underwent a similar trajectory myself but it s occurred to me more recently that rather than looking at the netherlands as a model we should probably look at nevada which is after all right here in the usa _meta_end_dot_

 unfortunately i don t actually know anything about the subject but i thought i d toss it out there _meta_end_dot_

 meanwhile it s striking to me reading various takes on this that absolutely nobody including the atlantic s resident moralizing social conservative seems to think the actual status quo policy of targeting hookers rather than their clients for primary legal sanction makes sense _meta_end_dot_

 the main impact of the current policy is it seems to me to make it easy for cops to rape prostitutes but hard for prostitutes to get out of bad situations _meta_end_dot_
