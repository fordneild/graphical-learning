  spokeytown writes talk about the hybrid car scam _meta_end_exclamation_

 with the exception of the prius it seems like most hybrids have highway mileage somewhere in the _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ mpg range _meta_end_dot_

 this is a little better than those same car models with a gas engine _meta_end_dot_

 but i own a _meta_number_ref_ honda hatchback obviously not a hybrid which gets _meta_number_ref_ odd mpg on the highway and i remember it being pretty routine in the _meta_number_ref_s and _meta_number_ref_s for economy cars or even _meta_number_ref_ door models to have comparable mileage _meta_end_dot_

 i imagine it mostly has to do with the massive increase in horsepower in recent years or maybe heavier cars as a result of safety features _meta_end_dot_

 but how are hybrids supposed to help us out of the global warming foreign oil dependence trap when they are less efficient than a _meta_number_ref_ year old non hybrid beater _meta_end_question_

 and why not just make cars like the aforesaid beater with a hybrid engine in them _meta_end_question_

 over time technology improves and we develop more efficient ways of burning gasoline as a way of making a car move forward _meta_end_dot_

 those kind of advances can be used to reduce the overall quantity of gasoline burned but they can also be used to increase the overall power of engines _meta_end_dot_

 that s the basic problem being pointed to here and it s why if you want to reduce carbon emissions there s ultimately no substitute for an emissions cap or a carbon tax _meta_end_dot_

 if you create a financial incentive to reduce emissions then our vast ingenuity and entrepreneurial spirit will produce vehicles that accomplish that goal _meta_end_dot_

 if we don t it won t as even the very same technologies that could reduce gasoline consumption are instead turned to other purposes _meta_end_dot_

 meanwhile it s important to remember that for the short tun the most important thing isn t to develop futuristic new low emissions vehicles _meta_end_dot_

 the low hanging fruit is to replace the very least efficient vehicles with more efficient ones _meta_end_dot_

 replacing an suv with a standard sedan does more to cut consumption than does replacing a sedan with a hybrid _meta_end_dot_

 even replacing an suv with a minivan brings about substantial reductions _meta_end_dot_
