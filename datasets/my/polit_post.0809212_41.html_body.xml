  ed kilgore has an excellent post on the oddly backward nature of john mccain s current biography tour and the general weirdness of the campaign emphasizing the idea that their candidate is genetically programmed to monger war through his jingoistic heritage or something _meta_end_dot_

 ed notes the analogy to bob dole s _meta_number_ref_ campaign the last time the gop thought having an old man talk fondly about long past suffering was a good way to win elections _meta_end_dot_

 relatedly i think it was matt stoller who pointed out recently that the candidate with the more impressive military record lost in _meta_number_ref_ and _meta_number_ref_ and _meta_number_ref_ and _meta_number_ref_ so there s reason to doubt that mccain s genuinely impressive military record will serve as an ace in the hole for his campaign _meta_end_dot_

 what i ll say on behalf of this strategy is that it s the best way i can think of to try to take advantage of older people s potential discomfort with the idea of a woman or a black man in the white house that doesn t involve exploiting racism or sexism in a discreditable way _meta_end_dot_

 mccain s putting together an identity politics counter narrative steeped in nostalgia it didn t work against a white southerner running on a very cautious agenda but _meta_number_ref_ is going to see the democrats nominating an unorthodox candidate running on a more liberal agenda _meta_end_dot_

 to me though one primary issue in a mccain obama race is going to be how successful mccain can be at obscuring his enormous hostility to america s public sector retirement infrastructure _meta_end_dot_

 mccain s record and that of his key economic advisors is pretty clear these are people who want to gut social security and medicare in order to clear budgetary space for an agenda of low taxes and many wars _meta_end_dot_

 the resulting situation will be fine for those senior citizens who like mccain had the foresight to divorce their first wife in order to marry an heiress and then secure a congressional pension but others may not achieve such happy results _meta_end_dot_

 that could all be very damaging to mccain s old people strategy but to be damaging democrats will need to move on to the general election first _meta_end_dot_
