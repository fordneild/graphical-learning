  not only should the press stop saying john mccain called for don rumsfeld s resignation when he made no such call they might want to note that he specifically attacked those who were calling for a rumsfeld resignation _meta_end_dot_

 here he is in november of _meta_number_ref_ audience my name is sabah elbardisi sp with al jazeera tv _meta_end_dot_

 senator mr _meta_end_dot_

 gephardt spoke on sunday and said that mr _meta_end_dot_

 rumsfeld is not doing a good job and he stopped short of calling for his resignation _meta_end_dot_

 he also said that the presidents cannot leave the responsibilities for their subordinates _meta_end_dot_

 are you also calling for his resignation _meta_end_question_

 or what are you calling for _meta_end_question_

 mccain no _meta_end_dot_

 i think there are certain things that happen with the elections a president to select his team is certainly a part of that _meta_end_dot_

 i certainly would not advocate that _meta_end_dot_

 this came in the context of a speech followed by q a in which mccain discussed problems in iraq at length and didn t mention sectarianism at all and indeed he seemed to be unaware of the existence of a shiite sunni split in iraq _meta_end_dot_

 update attack is too strong a word _meta_end_dot_

 the point however is that people were calling for rumsfeld s resignation mccain was asked about those people and mccain said those people were wrong _meta_end_dot_

 for mccain to turn around and characterize that as him calling for rumsfeld s resignation is highly dishonest _meta_end_dot_
