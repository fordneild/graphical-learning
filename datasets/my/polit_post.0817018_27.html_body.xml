  it s been a while since we ve had a robots post here but i believe this is the world first robot rock band will they hook up with robot groupies after the show you ask _meta_end_question_

 they just might if this japanese robot girlfriend initiative picks up steam _meta_end_dot_

 be afraid _meta_end_dot_

 incidentally wouldn t countering the robot menace be a good issue for john mccain _meta_end_question_

 it seems to play to his combination of cranky old man ness and national security paranoia _meta_end_dot_

 they all laughed at admiral adama when he didn t want networked computer on the galactica but look how that turned out _meta_end_dot_
