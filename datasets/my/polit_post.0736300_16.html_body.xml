  a lot of people seem fascinated with things like the political predictions charts on intrade _meta_end_dot_

 i frankly would very much like to be fascinated with them _meta_end_dot_

 but in reality they re deadly boring _meta_end_dot_

 take the betting on the republican nomination for example _meta_end_dot_

 it s clearly just a kind of lagging indicator of semi informed conventional wisdom _meta_end_dot_

 the crowd didn t have a premonition of mike huckabee s rise and more damningly the crowd didn t have the foreknowledge to recognize that huckabee s surge was going to lead to a backlash and heightened scrutiny _meta_end_dot_

 so he skyrockets up and then down he dips _meta_end_dot_

 on the democratic side meanwhile hillary is currently valued at _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ and i m absolutely certain that if she loses in iowa of which there s certainly more than a _meta_number_ref_ percent chance of happening then she ll plunge _meta_end_dot_

 not that any of that is wrong but it s not especially interesting _meta_end_dot_

 you d like to see some kind of noteworthy divergence between what the betting markets are saying and what people in dc speculate about around the water cooler _meta_end_dot_

 instead you get something that seems to be an equal blend of what people say around the water cooler with national polls _meta_end_dot_

 in formal terms i guess the problem is that everyone is working off the same bits of inadequate information so nothing s really being aggregated _meta_end_dot_

 we all know what the latest polls say and that the outcomes in the early states matter more _meta_end_dot_

 put all of us knowing the same thing together and what you get is dull dull dull _meta_end_dot_
