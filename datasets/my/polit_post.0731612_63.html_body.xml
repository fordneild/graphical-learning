  this is pretty random but hugo pottisch left a link to this video in comments on an unrelated post and it s pretty impressive meanwhile i m reading david nichols book a matter of justice eisenhower and the beginning of the civil rights movement which makes the case that too little attention has been paid to ike s progressive record in this regard and that one shouldn t regard things like the appointment of earl warren and other pro civil rights judges as an accident _meta_end_dot_
