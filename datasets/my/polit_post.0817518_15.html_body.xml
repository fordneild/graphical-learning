  michael mclawhorn asks why don t you talk about the consequences of permanently high oil for the food production business _meta_end_question_

 does the high cost of fertilizer mean a drop in productivity and some kind of malthusian nightmare _meta_end_question_

 or can we sustain a large world population of food production with permanently expensive petroleum _meta_end_question_

 a malthusian nightmare seems unlikely to me _meta_end_dot_

 in pure acres of land cultivated per calorie consumed meat is ridiculously inefficient _meta_end_dot_

 if you used the acreage that you dedicating to growing feed for the animal and used that land to grow plant food for people instead you could feed many more people _meta_end_dot_

 so viewed in that light a rise in the costs of agricultural production is unlikely to lead to mass starvation _meta_end_dot_

 rather we ll see a return to an earlier pattern of lower overall levels of meat consumption and probably more consumption of the relatively undesirable cuts of meat hello tongue sandwich _meta_end_dot_

 there s good reason to believe that consuming less food overall and less meat in particular would improve public health in the rich world so even though it would make me sad i m certainly part of the public health problem in terms of meat consumption it s perhaps not to be regretted _meta_end_dot_

 relatedly i ve heard it plausibly argued that if you re interested in reducing your carbon footprint reducing your meat consumption is probably the best thing to do _meta_end_dot_

 that strikes me as something that if true is more interesting if read the other way round one major consequence of limiting carbon emissions would be to create financial incentives for people to eat less meat and more plants _meta_end_dot_

 that kind of thing is one reason why i think the cost of adjusting to a low carbon future will actually prove much lower than people think _meta_end_dot_

 a lot of the changes in habit that a world of more expensive energy will incentive are things that there are sound unrelated reasons to do _meta_end_dot_

 less meat eating and more walking and biking would improve the health and long term quality of life of the population _meta_end_dot_
