  so i hear that while i was on the plane the republicans had themselves a debate _meta_end_dot_

 did people watch _meta_end_question_

 what did you think _meta_end_question_

 this bit from rudy giuliani jumped out at me mr _meta_end_dot_

 cooper if roe v _meta_end_dot_

 wade was returned congress passed a federal ban on all abortions and it came to your desk would you sign it _meta_end_question_

 yes or no _meta_end_dot_

 mr _meta_end_dot_

 giuliani i probably would not sign it _meta_end_dot_

 i would leave it to the states to make that decision _meta_end_dot_

 applause i think that that i think look the problem with roe against wade is that it took the decision away from the state _meta_end_dot_

 if roe against wade if roe against wade were overturned because it was poorly decided if the justices decide that it would then go back to the states and it would seem to me that that would be the answer _meta_end_dot_

 the answer is that each state would make a different decision _meta_end_dot_

 i don t believe in the circumstance that you asked before that it should be criminalized _meta_end_dot_

 i think that would be a mistake unless we re talking about partial birth abortion or late term abortion _meta_end_dot_

 this manages to make even less sense than the general abortion federalism position _meta_end_dot_

 it s a state issue unless it s late term _meta_end_question_

 why would that be _meta_end_question_

 i suppose this is politically smart terrain for rudy to stake out but it s terribly incoherent on the merits _meta_end_dot_
