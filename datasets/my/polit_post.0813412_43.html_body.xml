  reading an article about how the current wave of immigrants is assimilating just fine thank you atrios remarks that as someone who lives in a city which still has plenty of white ethnic enclaves i ve long been puzzled by the widespread belief that today s immigrants are somehow different aside from the skin color of some of them one point is simply that a lot of people seem to have exaggerated ideas about past assimilation and simply don t realize that _meta_number_ref_ years ago just like today major american cities had foreign language newspapers and things like yiddish theater that were the equivalent of univision _meta_end_dot_

 there never was a time when people got off the boat immediately enrolled themselves in english immersion classes and gave birth to perfect little anglo saxon children _meta_end_dot_

 it was always the case that linguistic social and economic integration was a complicated multigenerational process
