  as you may have heard we ve had a bit of a scandal here in dc where it turns out that some officials with the district s tax authority have been ripping the city off for years to the tune of tens of millions of dollars _meta_end_dot_

 or as the dc examiner sees it we ve learned that women like to shop men of course don t shop with our money we just spend it buying things _meta_end_dot_

 maybe if the mayor had just invested in one of these control a woman remote controls we wouldn t have these problems _meta_end_question_
