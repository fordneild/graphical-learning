  a few points one mccain is a very bad public speaker _meta_end_dot_

 two it s interesting that he s shifted his aesthetic from his old black and white fascist aesthetic to a new green and white islamo fascist aesthetic _meta_end_dot_

 three despite the general badness of his speaking manner mccain does have highs and lows _meta_end_dot_

 you can tell that he gets excited personally when talking in a generic way about how america is awesome _meta_end_dot_

 but when he waxes about reforming government institutions it s obvious that mccain is bored and not at all the kind of person who s inclined to immerse himself in the details of these kind of issues _meta_end_dot_

 four even mccain s audience doesn t seem to like this speech _meta_end_dot_
