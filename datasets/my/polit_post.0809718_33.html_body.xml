  normally you can find me ranting against the environmental and public health ills of over reliance on cars but tyler cowen offers this quote from peter moskos cop in the hood which reminds us that it s also had a devastating impact on police work car patrol eliminated the neighborhood police officer _meta_end_dot_

 police were pulled off neighborhood beats to fill cars _meta_end_dot_

 but motorized patrol the cornerstone of urban policing has no effect on crime rates victimization or public satisfaction _meta_end_dot_

 lawrence sherman was an early critic of telephone dispatch and motorized patrol noted the rise of telephone dispatch transformed both the method and purpose of patrol _meta_end_dot_

 instead of watching to prevent crime motorized police patrol became a process of merely waiting to respond to crime the big rise in crime rates over the course of the _meta_number_ref_s and _meta_number_ref_s rapidly became more grist for the mill of america s ideological battles but a lot of what we can do to reduce crime seems to involve basically un ideological management tweaks _meta_end_dot_

 unfortunately cities have been very slow to respond to research with actual shifts in policy _meta_end_dot_

 but there s tons of evidence to suggest that cops doing patrol work need to spend less time responding to calls and much less time in their cars _meta_end_dot_

 beyond the factors noted above when you re driving a car you need to be watching the road or you re cause an accident _meta_end_dot_

 but to do effect patrol you need to be watching what s happening in the neighborhood not just breezing past it _meta_end_dot_
