  i think this is getting a bit silly _meta_end_dot_

 in his column paul krugman seems to suggest that the main reason the clinton administration failed to bring about major progressive change in the _meta_number_ref_s is that they didn t talk enough smack about ronald reagan _meta_end_dot_

 and now on the blog we learn that clinton is clearly the more progressive alternative to obama because here s one quote of clinton saying something lefty sounding and here s one quote which krugman insists on willfully misconstruing _meta_end_dot_

 whatever happened to the krugman who used to urge journalists to worry less about what rhetorical style politicians adopt and more looking at their policies _meta_end_question_

 didn t this all start because krugman thought obama s health care plan while constituting an improvement over the status quo isn t as good as hillary clinton s _meta_end_question_

 that s what i remember _meta_end_dot_

 and i think it was a fair point _meta_end_dot_

 but now we re supposed to believe that obama s the second coming of ronald reagan _meta_end_dot_

 or something _meta_end_dot_

 meanwhile i wish krugman would at least acknowledge that there are foreign policy issues facing the country and some of us think they re important _meta_end_dot_

 i don t think that candidate b i e hillary clinton despite the progressive talk is just bush the third but at times she s shown a disturbing amount of common ground with bush s foreign policy views _meta_end_dot_

 at other times she s seemed quite good but her record on iraq is bad _meta_end_dot_

 back to the beginning i think it s extremely clear that the meager results of the clinton administration relate in the first instance to the large number of conservatives in congress when clinton was president and in the second instance to the moderate views of clinton administration figures _meta_end_dot_

 an inability to upend narratives about reagan was neither here nor there _meta_end_dot_

 in terms of congress again one thing a lot of people like about obama is that democratic politicians running in marginal areas overwhelmingly seem to believe that they would do better with obama at the head of the ticket _meta_end_dot_

 that said i ll freely grant that i m getting a bit tired of defending obama and his campaign _meta_end_dot_

 stuff like this from krugman clearly hurts them but the easiest way to deflect claims that obama is the more conservative choice would be for obama to say so himself in a clear and direct way _meta_end_dot_

 given that clinton is very much running as her husband s wife it should hardly be impossible to make the case that establishing continuity with the moderate clinton administration is the moderate choice _meta_end_dot_
