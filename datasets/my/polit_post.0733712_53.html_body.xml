  the other day karl rove went on television and stated falsely that it was congressional democrats rather than the bush administration that pushed for the authorization of the use of military force in iraq vote to happen before the _meta_number_ref_ midterms _meta_end_dot_

 either the story here is former bush advisor says things on television that aren t true or else there s just no story _meta_end_dot_

 merely restating the misstatements of prominent officials without flagging them as misstatements doesn t inform readers _meta_end_dot_

 instead as robert waldman notes via delong peter baker of the washington post did a story comprised of seven paragraphs about the controversy over why was responsible for the war vote followed eventually by some indication that there s a truth of the matter here news accounts and transcripts at the time show bush arguing against delay _meta_end_dot_

 asked on sept _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ about democrats who did not want to vote until after the u n _meta_end_dot_

 security council acted bush said if i were running for office i m not sure how i d explain to the american people say vote for me and oh by the way on a matter of national security i think i m going to wait for somebody else to act and of course one must keep in mind that baker did a better job here than what we ve often seen if you read to paragraph eight baker lets you know the truth _meta_end_dot_

 but of course this is why people go on television and lie _meta_end_dot_

 people who read just the headline attached to baker s article will come away believing there s a controversy _meta_end_dot_

 people who scan a few grafs will come away believing there s a controversy _meta_end_dot_

 and even people who read all the way through won t read shrill words like liar _meta_end_dot_

 so why not lie _meta_end_question_
