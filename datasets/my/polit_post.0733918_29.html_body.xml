  jonah goldberg s not happy that people are happy with the new national intelligence estimate the attitude among many people like say john edwards is that we dodged a bullet with this nie _meta_end_dot_

 but that s only true if this nie is right _meta_end_dot_

 indeed as a matter of national security it seems to me one could make the case that it would be better for the nie to be wrong the other way _meta_end_dot_

 that is to say if the nie is wrong better it be wrong on the side of caution _meta_end_dot_

 which would you rather an nie that says iran isn t pursuing nuclear weapons when it really is _meta_end_question_

 or an nie that says iran is pursuing nuclear weapons when it really isn t _meta_end_question_

 how you answer that question probably says a lot about how you view foreign policy generally _meta_end_dot_

 i think this kind of thinking was quite prevalent before the invasion of iraq _meta_end_dot_

 before _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ when contemplating starting wars with other countries most people were inclined to err on the side of caution which is to say not starting wars _meta_end_dot_

 after _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ things looked different _meta_end_dot_

 maybe the iraq situation was a bit unclear but best to err on the side of caution which was to say starting a war _meta_end_dot_

 it s easy to understand how that happened but surely the notion that alarmism is a form of caution should have died in the sands of iraq _meta_end_dot_
