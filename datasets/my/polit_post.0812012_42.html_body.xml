  it seems that back in _meta_number_ref_ john mccain understood how dumb john mccain s current position on iraq is host chris matthews pressed mccain on the issue _meta_end_dot_

 you ve heard the ideological argument to keep u s _meta_end_dot_

 forces in the middle east _meta_end_dot_

 i ve heard it from the hawks _meta_end_dot_

 they say keep united states military presence in the middle east like we have with the _meta_number_ref_th fleet in asia _meta_end_dot_

 we have the german the south korean component _meta_end_dot_

 do you think we could get along without it mccain held fast rejecting the very policy he urges today _meta_end_dot_

 i not only think we could get along without it but i think one of our big problems has been the fact that many iraqis resent american military presence he responded _meta_end_dot_

 and i don t pretend to know exactly iraqi public opinion _meta_end_dot_

 but as soon as we can reduce our visibility as much as possible the better i think it is going to be kudos to sam stein for writing this up _meta_end_dot_

 checking the record by using nexis doesn t count as reporting under the fairly arbitrary rules governing real journalism but it sure can be valuable _meta_end_dot_
