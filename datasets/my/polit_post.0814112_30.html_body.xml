  according to george packer david brooks is pretty perceptive when i met david brooks in washington he was even more scathing than frum _meta_end_dot_

 brooks had moved through every important conservative publication national review the wall street journal editorial page the washington times the weekly standard and now i feel estranged he said _meta_end_dot_

 i just don t feel it s exciting i don t feel it s true fundamentally true in the eighties when he was a young movement journalist the attacks on regulation and the soviet union seemed true now most conservatives seem incapable of even acknowledging the central issues of our moment wage stagnation inequality health care global warming _meta_end_dot_

 they are stuck in the past in the dogma of limited government _meta_end_dot_

 perhaps for that reason brooks left movement journalism and in _meta_number_ref_ became a moderately conservative columnist for the times _meta_end_dot_

 american conservatives had one defeat in _meta_number_ref_ but it wasn t a big one he said _meta_end_dot_

 the big defeat is probably coming and then the thinking will happen _meta_end_dot_

 i have not yet seen the major think tanks reorient themselves and i don t know if they can he added you go to capitol hill republican senators know they re fucked _meta_end_dot_

 they have that sense _meta_end_dot_

 but they don t know what to do _meta_end_dot_

 there s a hunger for new policy ideas i have more thoughts on this matter but for now the superficial does this really sound like a plausible reason for david brooks to have agreed to become a new york times columnist _meta_end_question_

 is there some long list of political pundits who turn down that particular job offer _meta_end_question_

 i m guessing brooks took the job because he was offered a job as an nyt columnist and that s not the sort of job you turn down _meta_end_dot_
