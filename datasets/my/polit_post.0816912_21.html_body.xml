  obama s ahead the new survey shows obama running ahead of mccain by _meta_number_ref_ percent to _meta_number_ref_ percent among all adults _meta_end_dot_

 among registered voters the margin is essentially the same _meta_number_ref_ percent to _meta_number_ref_ percent obama s also got the support of only _meta_number_ref_ percent of democrats whereas john mccain has _meta_number_ref_ percent of republicans and john kerry got _meta_number_ref_ percent of democrats in november _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 so in principle he could expand his lead by several points purely through base rallying gestures
