  um forgot this debate was happening until a quarter to ten _meta_end_dot_

 i hear there s been a lot of rough stuff out there so far _meta_end_dot_

 the two minutes i ve watched thus far involve barack obama seeming fairly cogent _meta_end_dot_

 update i don t like john edwards defeatism talking about taking on john mccain _meta_end_dot_

 don t give up hope for mitt romney _meta_end_exclamation_

 update ii glad to see barack obama taking hrc on on her claim that her record of backing catastrophic invasions of iraq makes her uniquely qualified to battle republicans on national security issues _meta_end_dot_

 update iii i think wolf blitzer s question about who martin luther king would endorse if he were alive today is possibly a new low for inane debate questions _meta_end_dot_

 it almost makes me feel bad i ever spoke ill of tim russert _meta_end_dot_
