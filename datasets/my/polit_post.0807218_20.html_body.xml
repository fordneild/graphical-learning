  there are two ways to conceive of a military establishment s proper relationship to civilian society _meta_end_dot_

 on one account the military exists in order to make civilian society possible _meta_end_dot_

 like police officers fire fighters bus drivers etc _meta_end_dot_

 the soldier is providing a public service that allows civilian social and economic life to function at a high level _meta_end_dot_

 on another account civilian society exists in order to make the military establishment possible _meta_end_dot_

 farmers shopkeepers industrialists etc _meta_end_dot_

 are here to create the resources that provide the supplies that a warrior needs in order to practice his most honorable of crafts _meta_end_dot_

 the former conception is what s generally deemed to express the values of a democracy or a republic _meta_end_dot_

 the latter conception is what you have in a feudal system _meta_end_dot_

 one way of understanding john mccain s oft expressed hostility to politicians his condescending attitude toward businessmen and his frequent attacks on selfishness and individualism is as expressing that more aristocratic conception _meta_end_dot_

 that would be in keeping with mccain s family background and things like this odd genealogical note he s interested in broadcasting _meta_end_dot_
