  matt bai asks john mccain which countries we should invade as we talked i tried to draw out of him some template for knowing when military intervention made sense an answer essentially to the question that has plagued policy makers confronting international crises for the last _meta_number_ref_ years _meta_end_dot_

 mccain has said that the invasion of iraq was justified even absent the weapons of mass destruction he believed were there because of hussein s affront to basic human values _meta_end_dot_

 why then i asked mccain shouldn t we go into zimbabwe where according to that morning s paper allies of the despotic president robert mugabe were rounding up his political opponents and preparing to subvert the results of the country s recent national election _meta_end_question_

 how about sending soldiers into myanmar formerly burma where aung san suu kyi remained under house arrest by a military junta _meta_end_question_

 i think in the case of zimbabwe it s because of our history in africa mccain said thoughtfully _meta_end_dot_

 not so much the united states but the europeans the colonialist history in africa _meta_end_dot_

 the government of south africa has obviously not been effective to say the least in trying to affect the situation in zimbabwe and one reason is that they don t want to be tarred with the brush of modern colonialism _meta_end_dot_

 so that s a problem i think we will continue to have on the continent of africa _meta_end_dot_

 if you send in western military forces then you risk the backlash from the people from the legacy that was left in africa because of the era of colonialism is it possible that john mccain is really not aware that the whole legacy of colonialism issue is also kind of a sore spot in the middle east _meta_end_question_

 here for the first time i actually have a ray of hope about a mccain administration s foreign policy _meta_end_dot_

 i d been thinking that he was motivated by grotesque moral and strategic errors but maybe he s just kind of dim witted and lacking in basic factual information _meta_end_dot_

 maybe if somebody tells him that the whole arab world and iran was carved up by the british and french empires in the wake of world war i a light bulb will go off in his head and he ll change his whole approach _meta_end_exclamation_

 actually though i think mccain s not alone here _meta_end_dot_

 very few americans even american elites seem to recognize that most of the pro american regimes in the region all the monarchies basically just are colonial regimes set up by the british imperial authorities _meta_end_dot_

 eventually the united states took over from britain as the foreign underwriter of those regimes _meta_end_dot_

 but to understand u s _meta_end_dot_

 policy in the region and how the u s _meta_end_dot_

 is viewed you need to understand that jordan and the g c c _meta_end_dot_

 aren t just autocracies they re autocratic creations of the british empire and centcom is seen as the successor to the colonial office _meta_end_dot_

 meanwhile the anti american or radical regimes in syria iran and formerly iraq all have their origins in rebellions against colonial regimes _meta_end_dot_

 the egyptian regime shared those anti imperialist origins but eventually switched sides and joined team america _meta_end_dot_
