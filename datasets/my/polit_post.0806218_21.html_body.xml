  call me crazy but i found the latest pew poll to be almost insanely good news for barack obama s prospects of beating john mccain _meta_end_dot_

 in particular check out these results on the left _meta_end_dot_

 they don t on the face of things seem like very good news for obama _meta_end_dot_

 but they come in the context of a poll that shows obama beating mccain by a large _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ margin _meta_end_dot_

 meanwhile it seems to me that the best argument mccain has available to him is to try to persuade voters that obama isn t tough enough on national security issues _meta_end_dot_

 conversely obama s people will try to argue that mccain is too much of a warmonger _meta_end_dot_

 given that a lot of what mccain is going to be looking to accomplish has been done already and he s still losing this looks like trouble to me _meta_end_dot_

 similarly obama is winning even though he s doing unusually poorly among self identified democrats _meta_end_dot_

 in particular older white working class democrats seem drawn to mccain in pretty large numbers _meta_end_dot_

 but you ve got to consider that at this point almost ever older white working class democrat in america has been the target of a lot of messaging from hillary clinton arguing that obama is too inexperienced and too dovish _meta_end_dot_

 they haven t meanwhile heard any messaging from anyone about how john mccain wants to privatize social security and cut medicare benefits _meta_end_dot_

 obama in other words is currently winning despite weakness with this demographic and is also almost certain to look less weak among this demographic in november than he does today _meta_end_dot_

 meanwhile in more good news for democrats in a clinton mccain matchup clinton wins too with a somewhat different pattern of support _meta_end_dot_

 basically even though _meta_number_ref_ percent of americans have never heard mccain criticized from the left he s still behind against either candidate _meta_end_dot_

 i think it s a pretty bad position for him _meta_end_dot_
