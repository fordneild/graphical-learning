  annapolis maryland pictured above sure looks like a nice place _meta_end_dot_

 and whatever else you re going to say about george w _meta_end_dot_

 bush he certainly doesn t seem like the sort of person inclined to sell israel down the river _meta_end_dot_

 but not according to frank gaffney who s delivered what almost reads like a parody it is fitting secretary of state condoleezza rice chose the u s _meta_end_dot_

 naval academy for the venue of today s so called mideast peace conference _meta_end_dot_

 the reputation of that extraordinary institution in annapolis has been sullied in recent years by a succession of rapes of young women _meta_end_dot_

 now you d think that a person who likes to go around publishing crazy things would be a totally marginal figure _meta_end_dot_

 not the kind of guy who would be a frequent guest on cnn and so forth _meta_end_dot_

 especially since his group is essentially just a front for defense contractors and their lobbyists rather than even a proper think tank full of crazy people _meta_end_dot_
