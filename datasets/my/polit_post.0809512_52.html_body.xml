  kevin drum was stunned into incredulity by this snippet of interview with karl rove what s the biggest misconception about your role in the bush white house _meta_end_question_

 if that s the misconception what s the overlooked truth _meta_end_question_

 look i m a policy geek _meta_end_dot_

 what i ve most enjoyed about my job was the substantive policy discussions _meta_end_dot_

 being able to dig in deeply and you know learn about something ask questions listen to smart people and form a judgment about something that was from a policy perspective _meta_end_dot_

 i don t know about rove in particular but i ve been consistently surprised since moving to dc of the extent to which the true policy geeks and the utterly cynical political operatives often really are the same people _meta_end_dot_

 these are the folks who while away their days ginning up dozens of bite sized policy initiatives and selling them around to politicians _meta_end_dot_

 they re the ones who give you your targeted tax credits and they re also the ones who are helping lobbyists sneak little tidbits in here and there _meta_end_dot_

 hard core ideologues often don t care that much about the details because geeking out over the details means you re talking about incremental change _meta_end_dot_

 but very practical people trying to win elections or do favors for key interest groups need to care about the details _meta_end_dot_

 as a result to be an effective cynic you really sort of need to be a geek _meta_end_dot_
