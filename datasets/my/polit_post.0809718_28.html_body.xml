  charlton heston not a very good actor but in his way a great one has died _meta_end_dot_

 to me planet of the apes is vital though your mileage may vary _meta_end_dot_

 his political trajectory was a little silly but also in a very fitting way utterly typical of the larger trajectory of american history _meta_end_dot_

 his death we hope comes at a time when the great backlash of which he was a part is finally receding _meta_end_dot_

 rest in peace _meta_end_dot_
