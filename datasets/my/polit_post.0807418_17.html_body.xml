  mark schmitt explains why the clinton campaign doesn t really want a resolution to the florida michigan issue contrary to the gullible media s belief that time is a powerful ally on clinton s side in fact clinton s only ally is uncertainty _meta_end_dot_

 the minute it becomes clear what will happen with michigan and florida re vote them refuse to seat them or split them _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ or with half votes as some have proposed is the minute that clinton s last path to the nomination closes _meta_end_dot_

 the only way to keep spin alive is to keep uncertainty alive maybe there will be a revote maybe they ll seat the illegal michigan florida delegations maybe maybe maybe _meta_end_dot_

 in the fog of uncertainty penn can claim that there is a path to the nomination but under any possible actual resolution of the uncertainty there is not _meta_end_dot_

 yes _meta_end_dot_

 the strangest thing about the twilight campaign of the past several weeks is that under any other circumstances it just wouldn t be happening _meta_end_dot_

 or rather it would be like the last few races that mike huckabee ran covered as an amusing sideshow _meta_end_dot_

 but because of the fact that bill and hillary clinton and their close associates have been the leaders of the democratic party for so long at this point they ve been able to take a remarkably slender thread of hope and spin it into a full fledged horse race _meta_end_dot_

 at this point though they re perpetrating something of a fraud on their many grassroots supporters who continue to invest money time and energy in an already failed enterprise _meta_end_dot_

 the bottom line however is that before the march primaries clinton looked doomed unless she could make up major ground in march _meta_end_dot_

 with all the march results in clinton hasn t made up any ground at all _meta_end_dot_

 that means she s doomed _meta_end_dot_

 the popular vote victory in the texas primary is a nice moral victory for clinton to console herself with but the overall results just didn t create the kind of delegate count she needed to be viable _meta_end_dot_
