  does anyone out there on the internets have any information about an old book called kintu a congo adventure by old timey children s author elizabeth enright _meta_end_question_

 unlike her other books this one seems to have vanished down the memory hole which when combined with the title makes one suspect it s incredibly racist or something _meta_end_dot_

 but is that true _meta_end_question_

 conventional research methods google wikipedia using google to find wikipedia pages don t reveal much _meta_end_dot_
