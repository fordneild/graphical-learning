  the next very serious thoughtful argument that has never been made before with such care or in such detail is ready to hit the shelves soon he also wheels out the novel claim that he s being attacked because he s hit something real a defensive gesture i ll be sure to remember when my new project freemasons rule the world hits bookstores next month _meta_end_dot_

 i expect to take some knocks for my argument which essentially exposes the fact that freemasons control the world but i m pretty sure my anti masonic friends will understand that i m actually making a very cautious thoughtful argument _meta_end_dot_

 in spite of what the title suggests it comes from an episode of the simpsons an allusion my masonic critics are bound to miss i don t argue that contemporary freemasons actually control the world _meta_end_dot_

 instead i m interested in the ways that important freemasons around the world exert control over lots of things that are in the world like governments the global economy science and those sorts of things _meta_end_dot_

 it s a work of political theory _meta_end_dot_

 sounds provocative _meta_end_exclamation_

 i actually live near a masonic temple on _meta_number_ref_th and u which a few months ago started renting out its first floor to cvs a company that i think really might control the world
