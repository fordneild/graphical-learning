  on the subject of analogies between the idea of establishing an enduring us military presence in iraq and establishing one in germany mostly what andrew said _meta_end_dot_

 but more broadly you have to ask yourself what the point is of bothering to construct analogies across obviously non analogous situations _meta_end_dot_

 nothing about the trajectory of us policy in iraq since the fall of saddam has resembled the years _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ in germany at all _meta_end_dot_

 one hardly needs to enumerate specific points of difference _meta_end_dot_

 the problems with this strategy meanwhile have nothing to do with analogies _meta_end_dot_

 the problem has to do with the fact that there are large and influential segments of iraqi opinion that are fundamentally opposed to a permanent american military presence in iraq and other segments of opinion that are deeply skeptical of it _meta_end_dot_

 meanwhile the major iraqi social movement that does favor a permanent us presence is kurdish separatism _meta_end_dot_

 that s the problem right there _meta_end_dot_

 when you define the mission in iraq as in part the construction of an iraqi government that will be amenable to an intimate long term security arrangement featuring a permanent american military presence you make the mission much much more complicated _meta_end_dot_

 the pursuit of this policy by the bush administration makes the american military in iraq a divisive destabilizing force int he country despite the best efforts of our soldiers to be playing a constructive role _meta_end_dot_

 and as long as we re there our presence will always be a divisive destabilizing force _meta_end_dot_
