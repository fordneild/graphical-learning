  i wanted to see what if any reaction hillary clinton s campaign had up on their website to her loss in maine but it seems they re ignoring it _meta_end_dot_

 also louisiana _meta_end_dot_

 and washington _meta_end_dot_

 and nebraska _meta_end_dot_

 and of course the us virgin islands _meta_end_dot_

 instead the latest results related thing i saw was a post super tuesday memo from mark penn that featured the illogic we ve come to expect from the man since long before he started working for hrc s presidential bid as super delegates consider which candidate to support they will be looking at which one candidate has a base and can win the big states including the crucial swing constituencies _meta_end_dot_

 we believe the impressive wins in ny ca ma mi fl nj az suggest that hillary is the one who can motivate a strong turnout in november _meta_end_dot_

 what about clinton winning massachusetts is supposed to convince me that clinton can motivate a strong turnout _meta_end_question_
