  tom friedman says we can t negotiate with iran yet because we don t have enough leverage _meta_end_dot_

 we need to get the leverage first and then we talk _meta_end_dot_

 mostly i find this whole line of argument wrongheaded for the reasons david shorr outlines _meta_end_dot_

 but we also need to get real here for a moment and recognize that we re the united states of america and despite the damage bush has done we have plenty of leverage _meta_end_dot_

 we re a giant rich country and they re a medium sized middle income country _meta_end_dot_

 we have military forces in two of iran s neighbors we maintain sanctions on iran that hurt their economy _meta_end_dot_

 our closest ally in the country is a rich nation with a power military establishment and nuclear weapons their closest allies in the region are non state militia groups _meta_end_dot_

 we have plenty to offer iran that would be valuable to them insofar as they re willing to change their behavior in ways that are valuable to us _meta_end_dot_

 that s all the leverage you need to start a process of negotiation _meta_end_dot_
