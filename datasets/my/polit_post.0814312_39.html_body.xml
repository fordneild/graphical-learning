  noah millman is willing to concede that munich analogies are inappropriate but wants to know what is the historical model for obama s meet with iran north korea cuba venezuela without preconditions well the trouble with trying to find an analogy of any sort that really holds up is simply that the geopolitical circumstance of unipolarity doesn t have real precedent _meta_end_dot_

 but if you want to talk historical models i think the best model to look at is just the recent past history of north korea _meta_end_dot_

 at times we ve conducted diplomatic talks with the north koreans _meta_end_dot_

 when we ve done that we ve made progress _meta_end_dot_

 conservatives meanwhile have screamed appeasement and when they got their chance to try isolation they managed to make the situation much much much worse _meta_end_dot_

 now clearly the agreed framework didn t actually wind up involving a presidential level with kim _meta_end_dot_

 but in my view the current dispute between obama and bush mccain isn t really about the question of presidential level meetings _meta_end_dot_

 if bush mccain were willing to have good faith high level talks with iran at the foreign minister level but had some weird hangup about the idea of a presidential level meeting i d consider that odd but not so pernicious and perhaps justified by the ambiguity as to who the iranian head of state is _meta_end_dot_

 but my understanding of what the current debate is really about is that the things obama has said indicate an interest in vigorously pursuing good faith negotiations with various countries whereas conservatives are open to the you surrender and then we don t bomb you model but fundamentally think that it s not possible to reach agreements with evil regimes so we need to avoid putting ourselves in a position where the other side appears to be making a serious offer _meta_end_dot_
