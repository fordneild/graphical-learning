  steve clemons isn t buying former senator sam nunn s efforts to tiptoe away from the anti gay record of his time in the u s _meta_end_dot_

 senate _meta_end_dot_

 to me the interesting thing is that he s bothering at all _meta_end_dot_

 i d heard nunn s name tossed around for a potential appointment in an obama administration but i d seen that as mostly idle talk nunn seems to me to have reached that semi retired eminence grise phase in his career where he co chairs panels of various sorts and gets mentioned sometimes as an example of the kind of statesman we don t have any more _meta_end_dot_

 efforts to reposition his profile on gay rights though seems to indicate that he really would like to get a job _meta_end_dot_

 but i m not even sure what kind of job that would be _meta_end_dot_

 he seems like one of several people chuck hagel also comes to mind who would be a good choice for a position as some kind of high level nuclear proliferation stopping guy _meta_end_dot_

 something like that with a narrow but important portfolio would be a good post for a conservative democrat or a moderate republican who was smart on the relevant issues the kind of thing that would be all about putting disagreements on various other issues aside to focus in on this one grave problem _meta_end_dot_
