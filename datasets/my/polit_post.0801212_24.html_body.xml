  to the best of my knowledge jim pinkerton is america s tallest political pundit by a pretty wide margin big enough to be an nba swingman in my judgment no idea about his game don t actually know the guy but have been in an elevator with him _meta_end_dot_

 he s also hopping aboard mike huckabee s presidential campaign where he s supposed to add some policy substance to the folksy populism and stuff about chuck norris a newsday columnist and fox news contributor pinkerton worked in both the reagan and bush _meta_number_ref_ white houses as well as the presidential campaigns of each _meta_end_dot_

 as a respected voice among right leaning pundits he ll bring instant credibility to a campaign that has drawn scorn from the conservative establishment _meta_end_dot_

 maybe _meta_end_dot_

 but depending on how you look at it pinkerton is some combination of too interesting too honest and too wacky to really add credibility to a gop primary campaign _meta_end_dot_

 consider his april _meta_number_ref_ column slamming george w _meta_end_dot_

 bush for failing to react more forcefully to the cia s summer _meta_number_ref_ warnings about the likelihood of an al qaeda attack _meta_end_dot_

 the base has gotten disillusioned with bush but i still don t think they re ready to hear that the hero of _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ s incompetence played a role in leaving the country so vulnerable to attack _meta_end_dot_

 he s a member of the futurists board of the lifeboat foundation an organization that advocates for effective nanotechnological defensive strategies and even self sustaining space colonies in case the other defensive strategies fail he s a contributing editor at the american conservative the paleocon magazine and recently has been waxing orthodox with a heavy emphasis on his anti immigration views _meta_end_dot_

 but back in _meta_number_ref_ he wrote a column titled slaughter of sunni foes is inevitable which made some arguments that are rather at odds with the current logic of the awakening strategy when will the anti american violence in iraq end _meta_end_question_

 it will end when we unleash the shia arab muslims and the kurds to finish the job all the way to the bloody extreme _meta_end_dot_

 we re not ready for such unleashing just yet but we re getting close _meta_end_dot_

 advocacy of genocide as a counterinsurgency strategy aside hiring pinkerton is a big step forward for huckabee _meta_end_dot_

 he s a smart guy with a lot of ideas _meta_end_dot_

 but he s a very unorthodox thinker many of whose ideas are at odds with the prevailing cw in the conservative camp sometimes in a good way other times as with the aforementioned counterinsurgency by genocide in not so good ways and it strikes me as unlikely that this will really endear huckabee to institutional conservatism _meta_end_dot_
