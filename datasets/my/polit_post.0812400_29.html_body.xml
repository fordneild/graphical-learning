  one of the odder aspects of american punditry is what a bunch of shrinking violets a lot of my colleagues are it s an endlessly polite business and when some bloggers come on the scene with their name calling everyone freaks out he said wanker i m shocked _meta_end_dot_

 meanwhile in the uk martin o neil describes london s new mayor as well as being a famous liar johnson has skirted the borders of criminality when it has suited his interests or those of his foul larcenous and over privileged friends _meta_end_dot_

 boris johnson is not only shady dishonest and incompetent _meta_end_dot_

 he is also a particularly offensive kind of clown as is evidenced by his absurd litany of gaffes and insults _meta_end_dot_

 worst of all is johnson s casual racism although it is perhaps not wholly surprising from someone of his class and background _meta_end_dot_

 in any sane society boris johnson would not be a plausible candidate for mayor even within the conservative party _meta_end_dot_

 good times _meta_end_dot_

 good luck london _meta_end_exclamation_
