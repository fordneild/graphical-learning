  ta nehisi well folks it s been thrilling being here _meta_end_dot_

 i want to thank matt for letting me house sit for the week especially in such estimable company _meta_end_dot_

 anyway i figured i d go out on a humorous note and what s more humorous than geraldine ferraro these days _meta_end_question_

 via balloon juice as for reagan democrats how clinton was treated is not their issue _meta_end_dot_

 they are more concerned with how they have been treated _meta_end_dot_

 since march when i was accused of being racist for a statement i made about the influence of blacks on obama s historic campaign people have been stopping me to express a common sentiment if you re white you can t open your mouth without being accused of being racist _meta_end_dot_

 they see obama s playing the race card throughout the campaign and no one calling him for it as frightening _meta_end_dot_

 they re not upset with obama because he s black they re upset because they don t expect to be treated fairly because they re white _meta_end_dot_

 it s not racism that is driving them it s racial resentment _meta_end_dot_

 and that is enforced because they don t believe he understands them and their problems _meta_end_dot_

 that when he said in south carolina after his victory our time has come they believe he is telling them that their time has passed _meta_end_dot_

 whom he chooses for his vice president makes no difference to them _meta_end_dot_

 that he is pro choice means little _meta_end_dot_

 learning more about his bio doesn t do it _meta_end_dot_

 they don t identify with someone who has gone to columbia and harvard law school and is married to a princeton harvard law graduate _meta_end_dot_

 his experience with an educated single mother and being raised by middle class grandparents is not something they can empathize with _meta_end_dot_

 they may lack a formal higher education but they re not stupid _meta_end_dot_

 what they re waiting for is assurance that an obama administration won t leave them behind _meta_end_dot_

 get it _meta_end_question_

 when you think an ivy educated black couple is elitist but think an ivy educated white couple is the salt of the earth you aren t a racist you just resent black people racially _meta_end_dot_

 big difference _meta_end_dot_

 i mean you wouldn t attend a klan rally or anything but elect barack and soon they ll be marrying your daughters _meta_end_dot_

 i would offer a rebuttal but colson whitehead closed the book on this months ago i m confused myself _meta_end_dot_

 for years they said you can t have this because you re black and then when you get something the same people say you got that only because you re black _meta_end_dot_

 i mean here i am the guy who got where he is only because he s black and yet the higher up you go in an organization the less you see of me _meta_end_dot_

 it s as if someone out to prevent me from getting what i worked for is preventing me from getting what i worked for _meta_end_dot_

 if only there were something a lapel pin or other sartorial accessory that would reassure people that i can do the job _meta_end_dot_

 some people say barack obama and i get everything handed to us on a silver platter _meta_end_dot_

 but we don t let it bother us _meta_end_dot_

 we re taking those silver platters and making them our canoes _meta_end_dot_

 then we ll grab our silver spoons and paddle to a place where people get us _meta_end_dot_

 north carolina maybe _meta_end_dot_

 or indiana _meta_end_dot_

 i hear oregon is nice this time of year _meta_end_dot_

 we ll paddle on brother paddle all the way to the top _meta_end_dot_

 one last question _meta_end_dot_

 i was only nine when ferraro ran in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 was she really this much of an idiot then _meta_end_question_

 or has time done a number on her _meta_end_question_
