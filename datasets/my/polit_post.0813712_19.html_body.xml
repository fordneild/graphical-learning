  gershom gorenberg makes the case that barack obama would be the best candidate for israel from the point of view of someone with different ideas about what would be best for israel than what some of the pro israel dogma in the u s _meta_end_dot_

 demands _meta_end_dot_

 that said at this point in time i think you d have to say that most obama fans who care about u s _meta_end_dot_

 policy toward israel are basically seeing what they want to see and hearing what they want to hear _meta_end_dot_

 i hope that folks like gershom who have sound views on this matter are right about what they re hearing but marty peretz likes what he s hearing too and it s genuinely not clear to me what obama s trying to say _meta_end_dot_

 in part i do think that reflects the fact that the divide between the hawk and dove camps is at this point actually quite a bit narrower than it s historically been _meta_end_dot_

 but fundamentally it s a reflection of a political strategy of deliberate ambiguity so we ll just have to see what happens _meta_end_dot_
