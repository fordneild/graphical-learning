  as the right continues to try to sort out a coherent response to the iraqi government s embrace of barack obama s vision for iraq john mccain tries a new gambit he thinks maliki s timetable is just fine so if mccain likes maliki s timetable and maliki likes mccain s timetable then logically mccain has to like obama s timetable _meta_end_dot_

 but that s not how mccain sees it obama s policies still equal doom _meta_end_dot_

 or maybe we re supposed to be playing by ken pollack rules where if we get the numbers all wrong then mccain and maliki have similar positions _meta_end_dot_
