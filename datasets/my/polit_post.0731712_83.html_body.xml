  garance seems shocked that this tom tancredo ad would actually air in iowa to me it s not surprising at all _meta_end_dot_

 i used to think that _meta_number_ref_ was going to see a tancredo surge based on his ability to tap into grassroots loathing of brown skinned people on the home front as well as in foreign policy _meta_end_dot_

 but then came the comprehensive reform fiasco which happened early enough in the race to get all the mainstream candidates on the anti immigration bandwagon so as a result tancredo needs to escalate his rhetoric to stay relevant _meta_end_dot_
