  just one more reminder about tonight s nixon library event for heads in the sand _meta_end_dot_

 i realize there are a lot of folks in l a _meta_end_dot_

 proper for whom the time location s no good but this is all i ve got in terms of travel to the area the terms of the trip are that i can t use the nixon library dime to come out west and then do events at other places so try to come if you can _meta_end_dot_
