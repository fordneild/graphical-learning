  this is bad _meta_end_dot_

 on the other hand sotu responses are always bad _meta_end_dot_

 on an appropriate curve i think she s doing pretty well _meta_end_dot_

 but on another level it s just an impossible task i think a sensible person would refuse to do it _meta_end_dot_

 in policy terms i basically agree s chip good global warming bad etc etc _meta_end_dot_

 update as many people are reminding me both in comments and irl jim webb gave a good response last year _meta_end_dot_

 sebelius is at any rate better than such fiascos as tim kaine _meta_number_ref_ and gary locke _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_
