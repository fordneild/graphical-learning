  more poll stuff more broadly _meta_number_ref_ percent of those surveyed said they would prefer a larger government that provided more services which is tied for the highest such number since the times and cbs news began asking the question in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 but an identical _meta_number_ref_ percent said they wanted a smaller government that provided fewer services _meta_end_dot_

 so the numbers are tied but focus on the trend _meta_end_dot_

 americans are notoriously hostile to big government in the abstract but tend in practice to favor expanded government services when you get down to specific examples _meta_end_dot_

 parity on the abstract question is huge and the change over time is striking _meta_end_dot_

 but of course you can be riding high in _meta_number_ref_ and then the mood shifts by _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_
