  brendan nyhan calls me out for too much psychologizing in my last post on john mccain _meta_end_dot_

 and it s true _meta_end_dot_

 i don t like the guy _meta_end_dot_

 he s not the worst politician on the planet but he s pretty bad and i m pretty sure he s the most overrated politician so thinking about him aggravates me _meta_end_dot_

 but these would be my sober minded non psychic points about john mccain and the economy he s not good at projecting empathy _meta_end_dot_

 his major political theme about the need to serve a cause greater than self interest is not well suited to projecting empathy _meta_end_dot_

 mccain s background is in the military his first political work was military related and his strong political issues involve national security _meta_end_dot_

 mccain says he doesn t understand economics _meta_end_dot_

 mccain really doesn t appear to understand economics he thinks interest rates should be zero but why he thinks spending cuts will stimulate the economy _meta_end_dot_

 he has a tendency to flip flop not on specific economic policies but on broad economic themes like whether or not inequality is a problem _meta_end_dot_

 his constituents in the elite press are weirdly obsessed with the idea that public policy should force average people to endure economic pain _meta_end_dot_

 all of this leads me to conclude that john mccain would not govern very well on economic policy issues and would fare poorly in a campaign that focused heavily on economic problems _meta_end_dot_
