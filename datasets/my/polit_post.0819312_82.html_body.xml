  taricha asks how long will mccain be able to keep up the balancing act of telling fiscal conservatives economic tax experts privately that he doesn t support the things he talks about publicly my guess is a very long time _meta_end_dot_

 the general quality of campaign coverage is very low the press likes being kind to john mccain and the press also likes being kind to the candidate who s losing so expect very little scrutiny here _meta_end_dot_

 what s more the pixie dust that makes this all things to all people magic work is the reality that president mccain is going to be facing expanded democratic majorities in _meta_number_ref_ so people assume that mccain s campaign pledges are quasi meaningless and that all this stuff would be reopened once he has to sit down with reid pelosi _meta_end_dot_
