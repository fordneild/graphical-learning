  belle waring returns to the united states from singapore where she lives boy but america s infrastructure looks baaad people _meta_end_dot_

 and everything is dirty _meta_end_exclamation_

 the girls were like what s wrong with this bridge _meta_end_question_

 a metal bridge in jersey leading from the newark airport to the holland tunnel i don t know what it s called _meta_end_dot_

 old metal that s just black with soot _meta_end_exclamation_

 and graffiti _meta_end_exclamation_

 man if i fully acclimatize to the level of cleanliness safety and well built massive public investment projects of singapore i ll never be able to move home _meta_end_dot_

 i believe it s the pulaski skyway pictured above _meta_end_dot_

 in part a country like the united states just isn t going to be able to compete infrastructure wise with a newly prosperous country like singapore we have a lot of stuff that s oldish but still usable and shutting it down to fix or replace it would be extremely inconvenient _meta_end_dot_

 but it s also the case that singapore s not spending _meta_number_ref_ percent of gdp a year on a misguided effort to control iraq _meta_end_dot_

 so yes we badly need a national infrastructure reinvestment bank _meta_end_dot_
