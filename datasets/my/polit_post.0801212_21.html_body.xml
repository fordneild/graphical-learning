  i think i side with brad delong in thinking that a fiscal stimulus plan doesn t sound like the hottest idea _meta_end_dot_

 on the other hand i enthusiastically endorse the practice of using the alleged need for fiscal stimulus as a pretext for passing otherwise desirable measures _meta_end_dot_

 i ve heard suggestions for example that we might provide people subsidies to do green retrofits of their homes _meta_end_dot_

 if you want to call that a fiscal stimulus to broaden the political coalition in support of it more power to you _meta_end_dot_

 the bush administration however is likely to see things my way in terms of pretext but have a different notion of what otherwise desirable measures amounts to so we ll have to see how the sausage gets made _meta_end_dot_

 meanwhile in terms of stimulus qua stimulus the reality is that the sausage making process is usually too slow and too crude to seriously impact the business cycle _meta_end_dot_
