  have i said anything about the proposed microsoft yahoo merger _meta_end_question_

 i tend to take alex tabarrok s view of anti trust issues in such cases _meta_end_dot_

 when you hear google complaining that the merger would pose threats to competition that need to be examined by policy makers around the world you have to think the reality here is that google s worried the merger will make the search market more competitive _meta_end_dot_

 that said peter swire s notion that the ftc oughtto examine the impact on privacy does make sense to me _meta_end_dot_
