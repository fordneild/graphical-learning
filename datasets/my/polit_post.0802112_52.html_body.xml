  live on youtube sundry pundits discuss the fact that barack obama would be a stronger general election candidate matched up against john mccain _meta_end_dot_

 as readers know that s certainly my view _meta_end_dot_

 and it s certainly the view of democrats running in red states who feel he d be better for down ballot candidates than would hillary clinton _meta_end_dot_

 it s been my experience though that it s basically impossible to convince people on this score _meta_end_dot_

 at the end of the day there s a ton of uncertainty surrounding this question and there s nothing one could do to prove things one way or another _meta_end_dot_

 given the uncertainty it s open to people who like clinton to just insist that well sure obama s more popular now but things would look different after a campaign _meta_end_dot_
