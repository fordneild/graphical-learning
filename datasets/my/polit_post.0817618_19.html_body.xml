  i think the idea of using prizes to try to spur innovation is a promising idea but i m not quite sure why john mccain s decided that a better battery for an electric car is the thing to offer the prize for _meta_end_dot_

 electric vehicles would be good from an environmental perspective but insofar as so much of our electricity comes from fossil fuels car electrification also has a large element of just pushing the problem around _meta_end_dot_

 the thing to offer the prize for is either some kind of clean electricity breakthrough some kind of carbon scrubbing or sequestration technology or maybe something to make nuclear waste disappear _meta_end_dot_

 also if mccain s cap and trade plan involved auctioning the permits the way barack obama s does then it could raise money for these prize schemes _meta_end_dot_

 something he might want to think about _meta_end_dot_

 on top of all that _meta_dollor_ref_ million seems preposterously low _meta_end_dot_

 a good electric car battery would earn you way more money than that in the course of things _meta_end_dot_

 for a prize to make sense the scale of the prize needs to be large relative to the potential profitability of the invention _meta_end_dot_
