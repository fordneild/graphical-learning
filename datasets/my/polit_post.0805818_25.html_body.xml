  the same chad ford article i mentioned early says that andris biedrins falls somewhat into the anderson varejao category energetic big man whose stats don t tell the whole story in terms of on court contributions but the story the stats tell is that biedrins is a pretty good basketball player _meta_end_dot_

 unless that is by stats you just mean per game scoring average but my stats say that biedrins ten points per game come on just seven field goal attempts _meta_end_dot_

 they tell me that he s also averaging ten rebounds and one block per game and he s doing all this in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ minutes as a young center who s coach likes to play small ball _meta_end_dot_

 ford s not wrong about biedrins the numbers say exactly what he s trying to say namely that biedrins is a good player and that especially given his age your team would be glad to have him _meta_end_dot_

 but for some reason he thinks these attributes are intangible when in fact they re right there in the numbers _meta_end_dot_
