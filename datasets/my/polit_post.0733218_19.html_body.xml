  via andrew sullivan i sure do like me this attack mode joe biden lighting into rudy giuliani sure there is but with these guys he knows so little about foreign policy he confuses terrorists cells and organizations with countries _meta_end_dot_

 there was no al qaeda in iraq before this war _meta_end_dot_

 al qaeda became a bush fulfilling prophecy _meta_end_dot_

 it didn t exist until bush went to war _meta_end_dot_

 even our own intelligence community says that _meta_end_dot_

 but these guys buy into this silliness that if you don t fight them in baghdad you re going to fight them in boston _meta_end_dot_

 give me a break _meta_end_dot_

 i know my man ezra klein s been touting biden as a potential veep pick for his attack dogging skills which seems like a pretty poor idea to me one needs a vp who understands that the presidential candidate is supposed to do the bulk of the talking but this is good stuff _meta_end_dot_
