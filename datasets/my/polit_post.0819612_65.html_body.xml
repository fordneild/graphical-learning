  ryan lizza goes long and deep on barack obama s background in chicago politics and his rise to the us senate _meta_end_dot_

 i keep reading people debunking the idea that obama is a messianic saint like figure and people criticizing the idea that obama is a messianic saint like figure _meta_end_dot_

 indeed i ve read so much commentary on the subject of how people shouldn t believe that obama is a messianic saint like figure that i ve become convinced that nobody actually believes that he is _meta_end_dot_

 but if they do exist they ll be disillusioned by ryan s article _meta_end_exclamation_

 but in terms of worries i actually have seen expressed i think the picture you get here tends to dissipate worries that obama might turn out to be a carter esque failure or somehow who otherwise doesn t know how to get the job done _meta_end_dot_

 he s an eminently practical person practical enough to understand that to advance you need to stand a bit outside and above the systems you re operating in but also very much operate in them _meta_end_dot_

 and not just to understand that which is pretty easy but to do it which i think is very difficult _meta_end_dot_
