  it was clear to me that the giants weren t going to beat the green bay packers _meta_end_dot_

 but then again it was also clear to me that the giants weren t going to win their other two playoff games either _meta_end_dot_

 thus the mere fact that the preponderance of the available evidence strongly points in the direction of a patriots win doesn t really prove anything _meta_end_dot_

 thus i predict that new england will wind up getting the loss they so richly deserve _meta_end_dot_
