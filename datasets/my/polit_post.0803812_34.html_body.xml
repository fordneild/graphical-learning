  ezra klein uses this chart from the cbo to illustrate the point that medicare and medicaid aren t in any unique distress that their cost problems are a function of health inflation across the whole economy not just in government programs and that to get their growth under control will require wholesale reform to play devil s advocate for a bit though one can imagine a scenario in which the economy grows fast enough between _meta_number_ref_ and _meta_number_ref_ for the non health care sector of the economy to grow notwithstanding the vast growth in the share of the economy going to health care _meta_end_dot_

 indeed if we keep up a two percent annual growth rate which would be on the slow side the size of our economy will double in just _meta_number_ref_ years _meta_end_dot_

 so there s plenty of room for health spending to escalate enormously as a share over the next _meta_number_ref_ years without that actually reducing people to penury _meta_end_dot_

 when it comes to public sector programs by contrast there s an argument that if the share of gdp that s going to taxes goes that high it ll destroy the economy _meta_end_dot_

 incentives deadweight loss etc _meta_end_dot_

 i don t know that i really think that s the case but that s the argument you would hear for why runaway medicare and medicaid growth is a special kind of horribleness _meta_end_dot_

 now for my view there s little evidence that health care spending really helps people so it really would be a shame albeit a survivable one for health spending to grow on this trajectory _meta_end_dot_

 on top of that there s good reason to believe that the most effective method of radically restraining health care spending is through full bore socialized medicine as in the uk s national health services _meta_end_dot_

 uk health care is slightly worse than what you can get elsewhere but it s way cheaper and uk health outcomes aren t wildly worse than outcomes anywhere else _meta_end_dot_

 save money by providing universal mediocre health care la nhs leave some of the savings in people s pockets and spend the rest on subsidizing mass transit and bike paths _meta_end_dot_

 or to look at it another way if hillary clinton s entire agenda were enacted her climate change proposals would wind up doing more to improve public health than would her health care proposals _meta_end_dot_
