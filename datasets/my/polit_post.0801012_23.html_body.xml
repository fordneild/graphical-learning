  i m on a listserve where someone mentioned as people tend to do disquiet over the fact that hillary clinton won t admit she was wrong to vote for the war _meta_end_dot_

 it reminds me once again that i think many more people need to seriously consider the possibility that this isn t an instance of her stubbornly refusing to admit that she was wrong nearly so much as it is a case of her not believing she was wrong just as for example michael o hanlon doesn t think he was wrong to have supported the war _meta_end_dot_

 lots of people who supported the war don t think they were wrong to have supported the war hillary clinton doesn t say she thinks she was wrong to have supported the war and i ve never seen any serious reporting that indicates that she thinks she was wrong to have supported the war _meta_end_dot_

 the biggest inquiry i ve seen into the question of why clinton won t apologize for having supported the war was done by michael crowley wherein he concluded that she probably won t admit that she was wrong because she thinks she did the right thing _meta_end_dot_

 it s a subtle distinction but i think it s worth keeping in mind both for what it may hint about how she ll govern and also for how it s going to play out in a general election campaign _meta_end_dot_
