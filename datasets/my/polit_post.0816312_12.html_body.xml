  one of the big problems with the boom in enthusiasm for jim webb as a candidate who can appeal to scotch irish appalachians is that he doesn t appear capable of doing so as eve fairbanks writes thanks to their analogous symbolic roles webb and obama have one more politically important and bizarre similarity they appeal to the same voters wine track democrats who come out in unprecedented droves to vote for a black man or a hillbilly white because they want their party to be bigger than themselves _meta_end_dot_

 while you d expect webb to attract poor rural beer trackers in his _meta_number_ref_ senate race he didn t do any better than the previous democratic candidate had among appalachian voters in southwestern virginia instead he was propelled to victory by northern virginia suburbanites obama s base _meta_end_dot_

 basically webb and obama despite similar personalities and personae both get the votes you would expect anti war liberals to get _meta_end_dot_

 possibly related check out this map taken from here what s that a map of _meta_end_question_

 well recently the census bureau started asking people about ethnicity and ancestry _meta_end_dot_

 so you might say you were irish or italian or german or chinese or cuban instead of just white or asian or whatever _meta_end_dot_

 but about seven percent of people identified themselves as american and as you can see that american bloc is really concentrated in appalachia and the southern highlands _meta_end_dot_

 webb s favorite ethnic group in short seems to be the ethnic group with the least ethnic consciousness _meta_end_dot_
