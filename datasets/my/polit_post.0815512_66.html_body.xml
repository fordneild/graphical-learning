  good piece from jonathan landay sens _meta_end_dot_

 john mccain r ariz and barack obama d ill say that iran is developing nuclear weapons _meta_end_dot_

 the u s _meta_end_dot_

 intelligence community however thinks that iran halted an effort to build a nuclear warhead in mid _meta_number_ref_ and the u n _meta_end_dot_

 international atomic energy agency which is investigating the program has found no evidence to date of an active iranian nuclear weapons project _meta_end_dot_

 indeed _meta_end_dot_

 the iaea has various complaints about iranian nuclear activities and it makes sense for the united states to vigorously pursue those complaints _meta_end_dot_

 it s also true that given iranian history on this issue and the nature of the iranian regime it s smart strategy for the united states to seek nuclear concessions from iran that go beyond what s strictly required by the non proliferation treaty _meta_end_dot_

 but the intelligence community has assessed that current levels of scrutiny and pressure caused the iranians to cease their weapons program back in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 it s worth considering how the refusal of american politicians to acknowledge this must look in teheran _meta_end_dot_

 in the hawk faction of the u s _meta_end_dot_

 politics you have radical clerics musing about the apocalypse playing a key role in the process to determine who the gop standard bearer will be _meta_end_dot_

 and even in the more dovish faction the lead contenders won t acknowledge our own intelligence findings about the iranian nuclear program _meta_end_dot_

 someone someone in iran is penning a furious blog post or article or memo about how you just can t appease the americans how we re irrational and our political system is dysfunctional about how we were determined to invade iraq irrespective of the facts and we re not invading iran right now just because it s not logistically feasible and that restarting a crash weapons program before it does become feasible is iran s only hope _meta_end_dot_
