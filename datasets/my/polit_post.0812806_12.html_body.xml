  tim russert just said we now know who the democratic nominee is going to be i certainly agree with that but i do wonder why it s just now dawning on the tv talking heads _meta_end_dot_

 march _meta_number_ref_ was clinton s chance to make up the ground she lost in february and she wasn t able to do it _meta_end_dot_

 we knew as of march _meta_number_ref_ who the nominee was going to be _meta_end_dot_

 oh well _meta_end_dot_

 glad to see more folks are realizing and maybe we can wind this thing down _meta_end_dot_

 i guess i should try to go to bed before flying to california tomorrow for the nixon library event be there _meta_end_dot_
