  the bandwagon grows the context recall is that democrats and democratic leaning independents are allowed to vote in tomorrow s michigan primary and since there s no democratic primary kos and others are urging democrats to pull the lever for mitt romney _meta_end_dot_

 i do want to continue to make the point that cynicism aside it really does seem to me that romney would be a less dangerous president than mike huckabee or john mccain or rudy giuliani _meta_end_dot_

 voting for romney in a primary is win win _meta_end_dot_
