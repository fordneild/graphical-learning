  william galston and pietro nivola have an interesting piece on the rise of geographic segregation in political presences where more and more people now live in whole counties full of co partisans _meta_end_dot_

 it ends however with a pretty lame entry into the literature of bellyaching about polarization because politics is a contact sport hard hitting partisan competition is unavoidably part of the game _meta_end_dot_

 a party system that differentiates sharply between alternatives has virtues not the least being that it engages more voters offers clearer choices and enhances accountability _meta_end_dot_

 but hyperpartisan politics also do damage not least to public trust and confidence in government and many americans understandably yearn for less polarization _meta_end_dot_

 because the underlying structure of our politics remains so deeply divided the _meta_number_ref_ election may not requite their wish _meta_end_dot_

 these upsides are what i wrote about in my case for partisanship article and stacking the upsides against the galston nivola downsides i think polarization looks pretty good _meta_end_dot_

 on the one hand we have more engaged voters clearer choices and more accountability _meta_end_dot_

 all of those are good things _meta_end_dot_

 the downside is allegedly public trust and confidence in government but it s not even clear that that s a bad thing _meta_end_dot_

 i don t trust the government as much as i did before i learned that it was running a network of secret prisons in eastern europe and organizing an illegal surveillance program but i d say that s a merited decline in trust _meta_end_dot_

 why would we pine away for a shift that would make government less accountable but more trusted _meta_end_question_
