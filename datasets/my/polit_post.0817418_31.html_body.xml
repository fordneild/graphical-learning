  rich lowry diavlogging with mike tomasky says there s basically no reason we shouldn t just drill for oil everywhere because the only downside is aesthetics i assume that people who work in the tourism business or who live in communities where many other people do will appreciate that aesthetics can have actual economic value _meta_end_dot_

 if we made it so that every spot of the coastal united states became horribly ugly the total economic damage would be pretty large _meta_end_dot_

 but even aesthetics for its own sake aren t nothing i assume lowry wouldn t burn starry night for _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 and of course the ecological damage done by oil drilling can go far beyond merely ruining the view oil and ocean life don t mix which is to say nothing of the environmental problems associated with burning the oil _meta_end_dot_

 ultimately though this kind of thinking is why the oil addiction language has gained such popularity _meta_end_dot_

 there are things we could do that would set us on a path toward reducing our oil consumption _meta_end_dot_

 alternatively we can decide that it s somehow just not possible and we need to reconciling ourselves to pumping more and more oil with that quest for oil overriding all other possible considerations _meta_end_dot_
