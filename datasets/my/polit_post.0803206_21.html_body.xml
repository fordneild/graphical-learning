  i didn t see the debate _meta_end_dot_

 but i espy an emerging consensus _meta_end_dot_

 here s mark ambinder i was tempted to call this encounter a draw but i am mindful that there are no zero sum debates in presidential politics _meta_end_dot_

 and twenty minutes of iraq happened _meta_end_dot_

 and so i ll give obama the edge _meta_end_dot_

 clinton was forced for about _meta_number_ref_ minutes to recapitulate her vote on iraq over and over again _meta_end_dot_

 it was tough for her _meta_end_dot_

 she seemed to mire herself in the details of history _meta_end_dot_

 and here s spencer ackerman the debate was tepid very substantive and saw minimal distinction between clinton and obama _meta_end_dot_

 then came iraq _meta_end_dot_

 and it ceased to be close _meta_end_dot_

 obama made the full spectrum critique of the iraq war tougher on terrorism than she was comprehensive in his reappraisal of foreign affairs vociferous on the need to get out of iraq and what its implications are _meta_end_dot_

 this critique that matt noticed yesterday _meta_end_question_

 it s not a fluke _meta_end_dot_

 this is his closing argument against hillary and then mccain _meta_end_dot_

 i remember way back in _meta_number_ref_ thinking that contrary to the then prevailing conventional wisdom hillary clinton wasn t going to be the nominee _meta_end_dot_

 it just seemed inevitable that someone who hadn t backed the war would be able to ride that issue to the finish line _meta_end_dot_

 in the intervening years that judgment came to look really bad _meta_end_dot_

 not just because clinton was on top of the polls but because even though a strong challenger who hadn t backed the war had emerged he wasn t really making that difference central to his campaign _meta_end_dot_

 more recently though it seems to have been getting more prominent play in obama s message and i think that s got to play to his advantage _meta_end_dot_
