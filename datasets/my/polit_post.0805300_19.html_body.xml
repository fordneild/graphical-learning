  obama s policy isn t as far reaching as i d like to see but this is still night and day between him and clinton _meta_end_dot_

 i have no idea what she s even trying to say about cuba _meta_end_dot_

 obama is talking sense directly labeling our policy a failure and then drawing at least a few of the correct implications from them with regard to remittances and travel _meta_end_dot_
