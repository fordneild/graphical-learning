  the obama campaign points out that their man won a majority of the states in play which is certainly true _meta_end_dot_

 on the other hand it s hard to argue that utah idaho and north dakota are a better prize than new york and california _meta_end_dot_

 the bottom line however is that if you factor out the more exuberant zogby fueled dreams of the weekend obama did quite well relative to his baseline of a week ago _meta_end_dot_

 the february _meta_number_ref_ landscape favored clinton and obama managed to not lose any of his states while poaching connecticut and narrowly grabbing contested missouri _meta_end_dot_

 clinton won but most indications are that she won t have won nearly enough delegates to put this thing out of reach _meta_end_dot_

 now the landscape gets much more favorable for obama _meta_end_dot_

 on saturday it s louisiana nebraska and washington _meta_end_dot_

 then on sunday it s maine _meta_end_dot_

 then tuesday offers maryland dc and virginia _meta_end_dot_

 then february _meta_number_ref_ offers wisconsin and hawaii _meta_end_dot_

 that s a lot of states but not a ton of delegates _meta_end_dot_

 on march _meta_number_ref_ comes the big showdown in texas and ohio _meta_end_dot_

 the question is whether obama can build up enough momentum between now and march _meta_number_ref_ to put clinton away or whether clinton can draw enough blood in the intermediate states to shut him down on the march _meta_number_ref_ firewall _meta_end_dot_

 who wins that is anyone s guess at this point _meta_end_dot_

 one thing i can predict is that you ll see a lot of handwringing about how this fight is dooming the democratic party _meta_end_dot_

 it s all as best i can tell total nonsense _meta_end_dot_

 disagreeing about which of two strong leaders should go try to implement a pretty widely agreed upon vision of national policy is a healthy thing to do _meta_end_dot_

 meanwhile the stuff that really matters for general election purposes won t for many months _meta_end_dot_
