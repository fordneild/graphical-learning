  to add to what ezra klein says about the new round of iraq related attacks hillary clinton is making on barack obama my issue here is that i don t understand what point her campaign is trying to make _meta_end_dot_

 has obama been less of a consistent strong anti war leader than i would have liked _meta_end_question_

 unquestionably yes _meta_end_dot_

 it seems that between the time he entered the senate and the time he started gearing up to run for president he adopted a pretty cautious political strategy when i wish he had adopted a bold one _meta_end_dot_

 that said russ feingold s not his opponent _meta_end_dot_

 hillary clinton is _meta_end_dot_

 is she trying to argue that her view on iraq has been to obama s left _meta_end_question_

 seemingly not _meta_end_dot_

 after all she supported the war and he didn t and all the things she s criticizing him for doing are also things she did _meta_end_dot_

 is she trying to argue that iraq aside she has a forward looking vision for us policy to the middle east that anti war voters should find more compelling _meta_end_question_

 i wish she were arguing this _meta_end_dot_

 i think barack obama s campaign has laid out some good ideas in terms of a forward looking vision but that there s plenty of room for improvement on what he s done _meta_end_dot_

 it wouldn t be hard for clinton to do better if she wanted to _meta_end_dot_

 but thus far she hasn t _meta_end_dot_

 instead on every issue where i can see daylight between them non proliferation policy cuba policy meetings with foreign leaders residual forces in iraq nuclear first strikes on pakistan grand bargain with iran obama is somewhat better _meta_end_dot_

 but he s vulnerable clinton could easily undercut his anti war appeal with bold thinking on some of these forward looking issues _meta_end_dot_

 instead though her campaign keeps going back to efforts to muddy the waters around who did what in the fall of _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_
