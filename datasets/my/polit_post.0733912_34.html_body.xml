  julian sanchez concedes the point regarding nanny state activity being perfectly reasonable when the people being nannied are children _meta_end_dot_

 instead he s upset on federalist grounds about the idea of congress making snack regulations for public schools _meta_end_dot_

 to which i say _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 eh _meta_end_dot_

 in practice arguments about federalism are almost universally made opportunistically _meta_end_dot_

 people favor devolving power to the states when they think doing so will produce policies they approve of and people favor concentrating power in washington when they think doing so will produce policies they approve of _meta_end_dot_

 everyone knows this _meta_end_dot_

 and while one might condemn the hypocrisy of it all this always strikes me as a good thing to be hypocritical about _meta_end_dot_

 i don t really have a principled view about the appropriate division of powers between states and the federal government and don t really intend to develop one _meta_end_dot_

 the congressional policy being enacted here seems to me to be a good one so that s good enough for me _meta_end_dot_
