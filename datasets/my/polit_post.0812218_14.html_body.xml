  via matt stoller some evidence that the total audience for cable news is on the decline msnbc s ratings momentum continued in april as the network finished the month as the only cable news net to show a viewership increase over last year _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ vs _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ m su total day _meta_end_dot_

 msnbc also showed the most growth in weekday primetime up _meta_percent_ref_ in the key adults _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ demo _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ vs _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ while cnn dropped _meta_percent_ref_ and fox news channel plunged _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 that s nice for msnbc and i do think they re the best cable network and have come to rely on them for primary night coverage and the overall lowering tide would seem to be good for america _meta_end_dot_

 one of my new lines when print journalism types start fretting about the blogosphere is to remind people that the emerging media landscape can t possibly be worse than _meta_number_ref_ hour cable news which often seems to be going out of its way to be uninformative _meta_end_dot_
