  there s a growing conventional wisdom that tonight s florida matchup between john mccain and mitt romney will be decisive _meta_end_dot_

 that may be true but it s worth noting how silly it is _meta_end_dot_

 assuming the jumble of polls pictured above is somewhat accurate the final tally between mccain and romney will be very close _meta_end_dot_

 meanwhile a non trivial number of people are going to vote for mike huckabee or rudy giuliani _meta_end_dot_

 and the winner of florida is going to secure a plurality that falls far short of a majority _meta_end_dot_

 if it winds up going _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ mccain romney huckabee rudy as insideradvantage has it there seems to me to be every reason for mitt to soldier on _meta_end_dot_

 similarly if arg s right and it comes down _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ there s every reason for mccain to keep running strong _meta_end_dot_
