  i suppose i should be over it by now but every time something happens like a provocative iranian missile launch i m shocked at how hawks are able to spin the continuing failure of their approach to the region as evidence of their own correctness _meta_end_dot_

 but the evidence is clear that the bush administration s approach is leading to a downward spiral of hostilities and that nothing good is going to come from john mccain continuing that approach _meta_end_dot_

 the alternative is to try good faith negotiations _meta_end_dot_

 it might not work but it really might and that would be much better than continuing this cycle _meta_end_dot_
