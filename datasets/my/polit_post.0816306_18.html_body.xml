  la takes the game and we have a series _meta_end_dot_

 boston was _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ on three pointers but only _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ from the field overall _meta_end_dot_

 that means they made _meta_number_ref_ two point shots out of _meta_number_ref_ attempted just _meta_number_ref_ percent way worse than the shot from behind the arc _meta_end_dot_

 that can t happen often _meta_end_dot_
