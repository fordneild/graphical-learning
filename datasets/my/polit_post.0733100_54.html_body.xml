  via an offended shadi hamid mansour ijaz reports on mitt rommey saying something awfully strange i asked mr _meta_end_dot_

 romney whether he would consider including qualified americans of the islamic faith in his cabinet as advisers on national security matters given his position that jihadism is the principal foreign policy threat facing america today _meta_end_dot_

 he answered based on the numbers of american muslims as a percentage in our population i cannot see that a cabinet position would be justified _meta_end_dot_

 but of course i would imagine that muslims could serve at lower levels of my administration so because there are relatively few muslims in the united states romney wouldn t consider a muslim cabinet official _meta_end_question_

 meanwhile before madeleine albright was secretary of state she was un ambassador _meta_end_dot_

 her successor at the un was bill richardson who went on to become secretary of energy _meta_end_dot_

 his successor was richard holbrooke who was widely viewed as a likely secretary of state in a john kerry administration and again is a very likely candidate for that job in a hillary clinton administration _meta_end_dot_

 john negroponte had the job before becoming director of national intelligence _meta_end_dot_

 george hw bush had the job before becoming cia director _meta_end_dot_

 but romney s telling us that current un ambassador zalmay khalilzad is too muslim to be so much as considered for a cabinet post _meta_end_question_

 really _meta_end_question_

 how repugnant _meta_end_dot_
