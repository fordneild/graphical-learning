  the bush administration has proclaimed a doctrine of unilateral preemption as a core part of its national security strategy _meta_end_dot_

 the limits of this approach are demonstrated daily in iraq where the united states is bearing the burden for security reconstruction and reform essentially on its own _meta_end_dot_

 yet the world cannot afford to look the other way when faced with the prospect as in iraq of a brutal ruler acquiring nuclear weapons or other weapons of mass destruction wmd _meta_end_dot_

 addressing this danger requires a different strategy one that maximizes the chances of early and effective collective action _meta_end_dot_

 in this regard and in comparison to the changes that are taking place in the area of intervention for the purposes of humanitarian protection the biggest problem with the bush preemption strategy may be that it does not go far enough _meta_end_dot_

 it s not the most scintillating paragraph ever written but it sure is a provocative claim _meta_end_dot_

 and indeed it s all the more provocative for the fact that one author was the highly regarded anne marie slaughter and the other was lee feinstein currently heading the hillary clinton campaign s foreign policy shop and certainly in line for a fairly important post in a hillary clinton administration _meta_end_dot_

 the article in question appeared in the january february _meta_number_ref_ issue of foreign affairs and i hope people will be able to convince the magazine to make the article available for free online since it s of considerable public interest in light of feinstein s role _meta_end_dot_

 thus far the other presidential contenders haven t seen fit to agree with john edwards that unilateral preventive war should be discarded as a tool of non proliferation policy but they haven t seen fit to agree with him either _meta_end_dot_

 hillary and especially bill clinton have been attempting to muddy the waters on the question of what they thought about iraq back in _meta_number_ref_ but the best evidence available from their conduct back then would be that they are supporters of unilateral prevention _meta_end_dot_

 feinstein s views as expressed in this article seem to offer further confirmation of that _meta_end_dot_

 particularly telling are his ideas of how international institutions and international law fit into the picture the contentious issue is who decides when and how to use force _meta_end_dot_

 no one nation can or should shoulder alone the obligation to prevent a repressive regime from acquiring wmd _meta_end_dot_

 although the security council still reeling from the iraq crisis last march now seems more interested in papering over its differences than in tackling these questions it remains the preferred enforcer of collective measures _meta_end_dot_

 the unmatched legitimacy that the un lends to security council actions makes it easier for member states to carry them out and harder for targeted governments to evade them by playing political games _meta_end_dot_

 on the other hand rifts within the council allow states to pursue wmd to advance their programs leaving individual nations to take matters into their own hands which further erodes the stature and credibility of the united nations _meta_end_dot_

 given the security council s propensity for paralysis alternative means of enforcement must be considered _meta_end_dot_

 the second most legitimate enforcer is the regional organization that is most likely to be affected by the emerging threat _meta_end_dot_

 after that the next best option would be another regional organization such as nato with a less direct connection to the targeted state but with a sufficiently broad membership to permit serious deliberation over the exercise of a collective duty _meta_end_dot_

 it is only after these options are tried in good faith that unilateral action or coalitions of the willing should be considered _meta_end_dot_

 this seems like a longwinded way of saying nothing _meta_end_dot_

 international organizations are very important and we should always work through them except in those instances when doing so might require us to do anything other than exactly what we wanted to do in the first place _meta_end_dot_

 for all the words their guidelines turn out to be no guidelines at all _meta_end_dot_

 force should only be used under such and such occasions and the appropriate group to decide whether or not the conditions apply is either the un or a local security organization or an out of area organization or else unilateral action _meta_end_dot_

 nice work if you can get it but if applied universally it s just a recipe for endless war and universal chaos _meta_end_dot_

 but one assumes that like bush style prevention this isn t meant to be applied universally it s supposed to be a for america only license to attack other countries _meta_end_dot_

 that however isn t an international non proliferation regime that s going to secure broad loyalty around the world _meta_end_dot_

 and without active cooperation from officials all around the world it s very difficult in practice to make a non proliferation regime work _meta_end_dot_

 which is going to mean more nuclear programs and ultimately more nuclear weapons the precise reverse of what the policy is supposed to achieve _meta_end_dot_

 it s a seriously flawed vision one that s phrased calmly in the language of international law and pragmatism but that s lacks substantive differences with the way the bush administration has been conducting itself _meta_end_dot_
