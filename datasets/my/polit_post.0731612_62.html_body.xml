  i m with ilan goldenberg on the political problems caused by unduly timid iraq plans barry posen recently noted the center for new american security proposal for iraq offers no strategic choice to the american public _meta_end_dot_

 democratic candidates that flirt with the vague ideas proposed by kahl are risking making the same mistakes made in _meta_number_ref_ and _meta_number_ref_ on national security offering hair splitting difference on policy but no real strategic choice or contrast to republicans _meta_end_dot_

 with the american public s opposition to the iraq war at an all time high the idea of offering a narrow plan not dissimilar to the policy already being pursued by the bush administration one which kahl admits does not have a high probability of success is politically tone deaf _meta_end_dot_

 with bush not personally on the ballot a debate over who would be the best person to manage a fundamentally similar strategy doesn t necessarily shake out in the democrats favor _meta_end_dot_

 indeed i think rudy giuliani mitt romney or john mccain could all mount very successful arguments on that score _meta_end_dot_

 a debate about strategy however is likely to favor the party arguing for a bigger change from the failed policies of the past _meta_end_dot_
