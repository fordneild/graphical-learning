  as i ve said i m a bit skeptical of some of these clinton campaign is full of screwups stories _meta_end_dot_

 an election is a tough zero sum competition and you can do the overwhelming majority of things right and still lose _meta_end_dot_

 in other words i have a lot of sympathy for what jim jordan says at the end of this article on people second guessing the clinton campaign s spending decisions obviously some campaigns are more careful and wise with their money than others jim jordan a democratic consultant who ran john kerry s presidential campaign until november _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 but these budgetary post mortems tend to follow a familiar pattern winners are by definition smart and losers are dumb and wasteful _meta_end_dot_

 in truth campaign budgeting is hard and complicated and three dimensional and just impossible to understand without the full time and place context of the whole race that said some of this stuff simply isn t a question of mistakes or not mistakes nearly _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ went for party platters and groceries before the iowa caucuses even though the partying mood evaporated quickly _meta_end_dot_

 rooms at the bellagio luxury hotel in las vegas consumed more than _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ the four seasons another _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 the firm that includes mark penn mrs _meta_end_dot_

 clinton s chief strategist and pollster and his team collected _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ million for fees and expenses in january in total including what the campaign still owes the firm has billed more than _meta_dollor_ref_ million for consulting direct mail and other services an amount other democratic strategists who are not affiliated with either campaign called stunning _meta_end_dot_

 that just sounds like self dealing by the people running the campaign _meta_end_dot_

 obviously once the money s been handed over to them they re allowed to spend it however they see fit _meta_end_dot_

 but if you re a working person thinking of sending _meta_dollor_ref_ or _meta_dollor_ref_ over to her campaign you ve got to wonder if that s just going to wind up going to rooms at the four seasons or as part of some kind of million dollar payday for mark penn _meta_end_dot_
