  i think noam scheiber s analysis of how whoever wins in south carolina mitt romney has the advantage is pretty shrewd _meta_end_dot_

 i would only add to what noam says that romney s already leading in delegates and since he s going to pick up even more in nevada that will further strengthen his position _meta_end_dot_

 the fact that the washington post can make reference to romney having a delegate strategy strikes me as telling _meta_end_dot_

 at the end of the day you need delegates to win _meta_end_dot_

 a strategy to win delegates seems like a smart strategy _meta_end_dot_
