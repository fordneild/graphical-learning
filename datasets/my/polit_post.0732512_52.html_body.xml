  he s surging in iowa _meta_end_dot_

 it seems to me that the ultimate beneficiary of this is probably john mccain _meta_end_dot_

 if huckabee can beat romney or even come close i think it exposes romney as weak and fatally flawed _meta_end_dot_

 similarly fred thompson seems to have already demonstrated an inability to put together a viable presidential campaign _meta_end_dot_

 that leaves giuliani _meta_end_dot_

 but i think it also leaves orthodox mccain hating conservatives a chance to reconsider whether they really think mccain s heterodoxies are worse than giuliani s _meta_end_dot_

 and i don t think they are _meta_end_dot_

 meanwhile mccain would have a lot of rudy esque benefits as a general election candidate but without nearly as much in the way of a track record of scandal and much and bizarre crazy outbursts though he has some of these too _meta_end_dot_

 in particular for years now he s been the rational respectable face of lunatic schemes of global american military domination _meta_end_dot_

 ramesh ponnuru s probably the smartest totally orthodox conservative out there and that s how he sees it and i think more will join him if huckabee succeeds in bursting the romney bubble _meta_end_dot_
