  experience in action _meta_end_dot_

 watch in amazement as hillary clinton specifically cites her experience as first lady as confirming her view that saddam hussein has links with al qaeda and active chemical biological and nuclear weapons programs and no she didn t read the classified intelligence that might have cast some doubts on her bush administration talking points that we had to address through war i for one look forward to a general election campaign in which every time clinton starts making a persuasive critique of the bush mccain approach to world affairs she winds up getting tagged as a flip flopper _meta_end_dot_

 it s time to get our heads out of the sand and have a democratic party that can make a clean break from this nonsense _meta_end_dot_
