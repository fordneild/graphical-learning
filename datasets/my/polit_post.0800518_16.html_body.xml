  marc ambinder brings the science one clinton donor and two prominent surrogates said they had been led to believe the campaign that by that if clinton were to lose iowa she would have placed a close second to john edwards a candidate viewed as eminently beatable by the clinton operation _meta_end_dot_

 but such is the lot of major clinton donors _meta_end_dot_

 and in truth despite a healthy measure of kremlinology the truth is that the campaign does not have a strategy to turn away the challenge obama has posed _meta_end_dot_

 in iowa one clinton adviser speaking before the caucuses said that were obama able to turn out independents and democrats in the number projected by the des moines register poll he deserves to be the nominee it seems to me that the leaks about plans to attack barack obama as too liberal don t make much sense as a strategy _meta_end_dot_

 but they do make sense as leaks that filter out in the absence of a strategy _meta_end_dot_

 i ve long taken the view that clinton s status as someone whose perceived as much more liberal than she really is is a fatal weakness in her candidacy except perhaps for the faction of her advisers whose views are probably too right wing to be associated with the democratic presidential nominee unless they can latch onto the one candidate both blessed and cursed with an undeserved reputation for liberalism in the absence of a clear comeback strategy some of those folks are perhaps letting their liberal hating id flow out a bit _meta_end_dot_
