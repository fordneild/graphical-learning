  chuck schumer s the best in the business at ginning up issues and headlines albeit in ways that often seem designed to make him a one man case for libertarianism _meta_end_dot_

 today his big idea is to say that we should block planned arms sales to saudi arabia unless they make oil cheaper _meta_end_dot_

 this is a silly idea on a number of levels but it does help illustrate the point that the shared conceit of the right and the left that our forward leaning military posture in the persian gulf is helping us out economically by giving us leverage over the natural resources there is ultimately pretty hollow our policies are just mistaken ones that fail to serve our interests _meta_end_dot_

 as for schumer though it s always disappointing to see how deeply invested he is in gas price gimmicks _meta_end_dot_

 the united states is a very auto dependent country obviously but schumer along with hillary clinton represents by far the largest pool of americans who walk or use mass transit regularly not just nyc residents but also the large number of metronorth and lirr users in the suburbs as well as the city that forms the hub of our only decent intercity passenger rail network _meta_end_dot_

 on top of all that barring major scandal he s never going to lose his seat _meta_end_dot_

 if anyone in the senate should be an advocate of good sense on transportation policy it should be schumer _meta_end_dot_
