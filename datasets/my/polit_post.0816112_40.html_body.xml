  it s very strange that john mccain can baldly lie to the press about a nationally televised speech he delivered last week and not get called on it by reporters _meta_end_dot_

 this wasn t some obscure address i watched it live as did political junkies all across the land since mccain scheduled it so as to come amidst coverage of the sd and mt primaries _meta_end_dot_
