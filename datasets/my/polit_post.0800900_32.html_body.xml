  i heard most of mitt romney s speech earlier tonight and he sounded a lot like the reasonably appealing moderate technocrat i voted for in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 certainly much more like that guy than like the three legged stool new model wingnut he s been running as _meta_end_dot_

 meanwhile john judis notes that despite romney s more moderate record he actually succeeded in convincing new hampshire voters that he was more conservative and bested mccain only among voters who considered themselves very conservative and were enthusiastic about the bush administration _meta_end_dot_

 in new hampshire these voters were a decided minority if rommey had run on his record in short he might have won _meta_end_dot_

 on the other hand we saw in _meta_number_ref_ what happens in a gop primary where moderate republicans and independents go for john mccain he loses to the conservative _meta_end_dot_

 but with mike huckabee in the field it s going to be hard for romney to consolidate social conservatives against mccain _meta_end_dot_

 of course it also remains to be seen if rudy giuliani can rally his forces to any extent _meta_end_dot_
