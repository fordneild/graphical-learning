  there was a time when i never could have imagined i d be reading stuff like this about my own country at the age of _meta_number_ref_ murat kurnaz vanished into america s shadow prison system in the war on terror _meta_end_dot_

 he was from germany traveling in pakistan and was picked up three months after _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 but there seemed to be ample evidence that kurnaz was an innocent man with no connection to terrorism _meta_end_dot_

 the fbi thought so u s _meta_end_dot_

 intelligence thought so and german intelligence agreed _meta_end_dot_

 but once he was picked up kurnaz found himself in a prison system that required no evidence and answered to no one _meta_end_dot_

 read the whole thing i don t really have the heart to make a witty remark _meta_end_dot_
