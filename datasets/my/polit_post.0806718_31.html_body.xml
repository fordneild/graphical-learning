  i also wrote a current on the wire s end _meta_end_dot_

 i also understand that the final episode has leaked on the web so some folks have seen it _meta_end_dot_

 i haven t _meta_end_dot_

 no spoilers please _meta_end_dot_

 update also i agree with ross about this the wire s greatest story was the rise and fall of stringer bell and nothing s matched it since i almost wish the great stuff with the kids had just been part of a separate excellent television series rather than an additional narrative arc of the wire _meta_end_dot_
