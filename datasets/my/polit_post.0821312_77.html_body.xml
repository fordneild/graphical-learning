  oftentimes policies designed to protect the environment involve difficult tradeoffs with economic growth _meta_end_dot_

 but sometimes they don t _meta_end_dot_

 sometimes we have bad policies in place that encourage people to use space or energy wastefully and these policies are both bad for the environment and bad for economic growth waste is bad _meta_end_dot_

 when confronted with such policies politicians have an aggravating tendency to gesture in the direction of local culture suggesting that people in their jurisdictions just happen to have as quirk a strong desire to see resources used poorly _meta_end_dot_

 thus via robert farley we get houston mayor bill white explaining why his city has such a low recycling rate we have an independent streak that rebels against mandates or anything that seems trendy or hyped up said mayor bill white who favors expanding the city s recycling efforts _meta_end_dot_

 houstonians are skeptical of anything that appears to be oversold or exaggerated _meta_end_dot_

 but houstonians can change and change fast as farley says when you read things like _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ houston residents have been waiting as long as _meta_number_ref_ years to get recycling bins from the city _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 the city says it cannot afford more bins you start to wonder if an independent streak and an aversion to hype is really to blame here _meta_end_dot_

 like maybe if the city provided bins to people who ask for bins then more people would recycle _meta_end_dot_

 or maybe we re supposed to believe that houston s independent streak extends to a desire to have government services provided ineptly _meta_end_dot_
