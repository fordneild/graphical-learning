  obviously eli manning won the super bowl on sunday and nobody can take that away from him _meta_end_dot_

 that said efforts to crown him the hero of the city seem to me to founder on the fact that scoring _meta_number_ref_ points isn t an especially impressive performance for an nfl offense _meta_end_dot_

 patriots opponents scored more than _meta_number_ref_ points eight times during the course of the past season but all of those teams lost _meta_end_dot_

 the difference maker was that the giants defense held new england to just _meta_number_ref_ points _meta_end_dot_

 teams that score _meta_number_ref_ points tend to lose games whether or not the opposition musters a great quarterback to face off against them _meta_end_dot_
