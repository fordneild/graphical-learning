  robert borosage has a solid roundup of the democrats closing arguments as they head into iowa _meta_end_dot_

 for my part i think there are reasonable cases to be made for both edwards and obama _meta_end_dot_

 it still seems to me that absent the presumption of inevitability there s little reason to prefer clinton but she s defused most of my initial hostility to her _meta_end_dot_

 i congratulate the people who feel a high degree of confidence about their preferred candidates theory of change or electability but from where i sit it s very hard to say who s right about that stuff _meta_end_dot_

 mostly though i m super pessimistic that any of the stuff any of them are promising to pass will actually pass no matter who gets elected _meta_end_dot_
