  i was intrigued by the idea of a new republic masthead editorial purporting to apply the lessons of kosovo to the situation in darfur _meta_end_dot_

 that i thought might provide a respite from the magazine s usual bomb repeat bomb take on the issue _meta_end_dot_

 but no but the biggest and most important parallel is this we asked milosevic to stop killing _meta_end_dot_

 he did not _meta_end_dot_

 we have asked sudan to stop killing _meta_end_dot_

 and still it kills _meta_end_dot_

 yes it occasionally appears willing to bargain _meta_end_dot_

 but while sudan bargains the aircraft continue to roam over darfur _meta_end_dot_

 the paltry u n _meta_end_dot_

 forces on the ground can do nothing to stop them _meta_end_dot_

 and that is probably how things will continue to unfold until this president or the next one remembers the example of kosovo puts together a credible nato force and finally says enough is enough _meta_end_dot_

 it seems to me that any serious look at kosovo has to carry with it the lesson that there s nothing nearly as simple as a say enough is enough option _meta_end_dot_

 coercive military intervention raises a lot of thorny issues _meta_end_dot_

 do we really want to commit ourselves to a kosovo style mission in which we wind up administering darfur for an indefinite period of time _meta_end_question_

 not that darfur is _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ square miles to kosovo s _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ square miles _meta_end_dot_

 similarly what about the wider consequences for sudan of getting into the partition business _meta_end_question_

 meanwhile though they acknowledge that the darfur rebel groups on whose behalf they want us to go to war are unsavory they don t think through any of the implications of this _meta_end_dot_

 before a country currently engaged in two wars plus several peacekeeping operations in the balkans starts a new war these are the kind of questions that need to be answered _meta_end_dot_

 the good news for tnr is that everyone knows their preferred policy has no chance of being implemented _meta_end_dot_

 which means that there s no need to think it through and also that there s every reason to adopt a maximalist posture _meta_end_dot_

 while efforts like the enough project to find constructive practical ways to improve the situation like darfur necessarily involve awkward compromises with reality the maximalist gets to ignore details and practical problems and hold the moral high ground for his trouble _meta_end_dot_
