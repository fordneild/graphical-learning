  jon chait and harold meyerson both nail down what to me is the fundamental political case for obama that to pick hillary clinton would be to reconcile ourselves to playing between the _meta_number_ref_ yard lines at a time when it looks feasible to open the game up and throw downfield _meta_end_dot_

 harold even comes up with an appropriately nice to the clintons analogy i ve turned to a book michael wrote _meta_number_ref_ years ago exodus and revolution and its discussion of why the jews had to spend _meta_number_ref_ years in the desert before they could reach the promised land _meta_end_dot_

 as walzer noted both maimonides and marx in very different ways argued that the jews who had lived in bondage had to die out and a new generation that hadn t known the habits of slavery take their place before the people could cross over into canaan and freedom _meta_end_dot_

 it s hard to imagine more thankless tasks than organizing for george mcgovern in texas or bearing the torch of progressive politics in late _meta_number_ref_s and early _meta_number_ref_s arkansas _meta_end_dot_

 and of course bill clinton really did take the lessons learned from winning in that inhospitable territory and put the democratic party back in the white house _meta_end_dot_

 from that vantage point he governed well and proved to a country that had come to doubt it that democrats could be trusted to run the federal government _meta_end_dot_

 but is _meta_number_ref_ the hour of mark penn _meta_end_question_

 i don t see it _meta_end_dot_
