  spencer ackerman geoffrey millard a soldier with the new york national guard was a general s assistant in iraq _meta_end_dot_

 he related a story he attended a briefing his boss about a soldier at a traffic control point faced with a speeding oncoming car made a split second decision to fire more than _meta_number_ref_ rounds into the vehicle killing its inhabitants _meta_end_dot_

 he then watched as the mother father and two children were carried from that car _meta_end_dot_

 that evening as it was briefed to the general and i flipped the slides for that briefing col _meta_end_dot_

 william rochelle from the _meta_number_ref_nd infantry division discom division support command commander and i have to apologize for a little vulgarity here but i feel it s intricate for my testimony he turned in his chair to an entire division level staff and he said and i quote if these fucking hajjis learned to drive this shit wouldn t happen to me in a sense it s these checkpoints incidents more than anything else that exposes the fundamental folly of occupation _meta_end_dot_

 if you re an american it s just not going to be tolerable to have a bunch of foreigners who only speak arabic manning traffic stops while heavily armed and ultimately accountable only to an all foreign chain of command _meta_end_dot_

 nobody would put up with that it s absurd _meta_end_dot_

 and of course if an american cop had put _meta_number_ref_ rounds into a car and killed a whole civilian family over a traffic violation there would have been a shitstorm about it in local politics and the legal system _meta_end_dot_

 even if the shooter evaded any criminal sanction there would be consequences you couldn t possibly just brush it off and put the guy back out there directing traffic _meta_end_exclamation_

 and conversely suppose you were asked to finish up your basic training and then go to a foreign country where you don t speak the language but there is a domestic insurgency that forms one part of a complicated patchwork of oft violent political machinations that you have no way of understanding _meta_end_dot_

 you ve got a gun some of your colleagues have been blown up and here s car speeding right toward you _meta_end_dot_

 how am i going to blame you for opening fire _meta_end_question_

 and can you imagine orders going down the chain of command asking u s _meta_end_dot_

 soldiers to radically increase their chances of getting killed in order to somewhat reduce the odds of iraqis being killed in good faith mistakes _meta_end_question_

 or putting your life in the hands of your fellow soldiers and then turning around and ratting them out if their errors led to loss of civilian life _meta_end_question_

 the whole thing is maddeningly impossible _meta_end_dot_

 i can t at all imagine the right way to handle these situations _meta_end_dot_

 shrugging it off with an if these fucking hajjis learned to drive this shit wouldn t happen clearly isn t the right answer but is there one _meta_end_question_

 i say no there isn t there s just no good way to be a long term occupying power _meta_end_dot_

 american soldiers are rightly accountable to american politicians who are rightly accountable to american voters but that means they can t be the ultimate source of authority in iraq in any kind of reasonable way _meta_end_dot_
