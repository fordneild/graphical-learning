  how much should we think about a player s per minute stats versus his per game stats _meta_end_question_

 dave berri argues let me close by noting that i don t think that people should solely look at wp_meta_number_ref_ or just per minute stats _meta_end_dot_

 if you did that jerome james who posted a _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ wp_meta_number_ref_ would have been the first half mvp _meta_end_dot_

 james though only played five minutes in the first half of the season so his wp_meta_number_ref_ doesn t really mean much _meta_end_dot_

 although i do think people need to look at more than per minute numbers i also think people need to stop focusing solely on the per game stats _meta_end_dot_

 specifically when we are looking at players who played at least _meta_number_ref_ minutes a contest we shouldn t penalize players whose minutes are closer to _meta_number_ref_ than to _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 such penalties as we see in the case of kg can easily cause us to miss the obvious _meta_end_dot_

 i think the players who are playing at least _meta_number_ref_ mpg are exactly the players we should penalize for lower minutes _meta_end_dot_

 after all a great player who offers you _meta_number_ref_ minutes per game is genuinely less valuable than a great player who offers you _meta_number_ref_ minutes per game _meta_end_dot_

 things like stamina injury resistance and ability to avoid foul trouble are all part of what makes for a useful player _meta_end_dot_

 it s the players who play less than that who we shouldn t penalize _meta_end_dot_

 of course you don t want to rely on tiny samples like in the jerome james example but a guy who s playing well in _meta_number_ref_ minutes per game is probably limited to _meta_number_ref_ mpg by coaching decisions decisions that might be wrong or might indicate a jam up of good players at the same position one of whom should be traded rather than fatigue _meta_end_dot_
