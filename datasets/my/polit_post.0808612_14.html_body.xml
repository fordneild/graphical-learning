  to say a bit more about the situation in iraq the details remain murky but the broad outline is that we re continuing to see conflict between the exile party isci which has been cooperating with the us and iran in post war iraq and the domestic nationalist shiite movement associated with muqtada al sadr which has received some backing from iran and been mostly hostile to the united states _meta_end_dot_

 from the point of view of american interests this seems to be a fight in which we have no dog _meta_end_dot_

 our main interest in this rivalry ought to be simply that it not turn into a bloody fight that leaves our troops in the crossfire _meta_end_dot_

 but that of course is exactly what s happening _meta_end_dot_

 why are we letting ourselves get dragged into this _meta_end_question_

 spencer ackerman explains here s an answer _meta_end_dot_

 as long as maliki is in the prime minister s chair and as long as we proclaim the iraqi government he leads to be legitimate maliki effectively holds us hostage _meta_end_dot_

 i need to go after sadr maliki says _meta_end_dot_

 the situation is unacceptable _meta_end_exclamation_

 in basra he threatens to take control of the ports and in baghdad he s throwing my men out of their checkpoints _meta_end_dot_

 would you allow the bloods or the crips to take over half of los angeles and as soon as he says that we re trapped _meta_end_dot_

 it simply is not tenable for petraeus to refuse a request for security assistance from the prime minister to deal with a radical militia _meta_end_dot_

 this is of course a big part of the problem with making an enduring american military presence in iraq a key strategic priority of the united states _meta_end_dot_

 to do that we need to make ourselves useful to some politically powerful horses in iraq _meta_end_dot_

 but to do that we need to get sucked into our favorite horses pet political disputes _meta_end_dot_

 so now we re there to provide backup and air support for the badr brigade as they try to liquidate their foes in sadr s political party _meta_end_dot_

 and if it doesn t work we may need to find a new iraqi politician remember iyad allawi _meta_end_question_

 ibrahim jafari to be our special friend _meta_end_dot_
