  everyone seems to agree that the new jersey nets shipping richard jefferson to milwaukee for bobby simmons and yi jianlian was fundamentally about clearing cap space to try to lure lebron james to the future brooklyn nets _meta_end_dot_

 one could imagine this happening but i have to say i ve always been skeptical of the idea that james would have substantially more marketing power in the big apple _meta_end_dot_

 i could see that for maybe michael redd who tends to languish in obscurity right now because the bucks aren t a great team and they re located in milwaukee whereas the best player on a mediocre knicks squad would be a star _meta_end_dot_

 but given james current level of fame if i were his manager i would tell him that team success is going to be a much more important factor than team location _meta_end_dot_

 james is already well known and you could make the case that he s the best player in the league right now _meta_end_dot_

 if he wins championships more people will make that case _meta_end_dot_

 if he plays with inadequate teammates and exits the playoffs in the first round people will start talking about how he s overrated and the world will move on to its next basketball savior _meta_end_dot_

 to me that would have to be the reason to leave cleveland to move to a team with a better shot of winning _meta_end_dot_

 ultimately it s hard to sustain success as an nba star without being on teams that go deep in the playoffs _meta_end_dot_
