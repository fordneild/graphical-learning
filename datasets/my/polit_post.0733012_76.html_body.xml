  spencer ackerman translates the white house s principles for perpetual occupation of iraq out of the obfuscatorese a democratic iraq here means the shiite led iraqi government _meta_end_dot_

 the current political arrangement will receive u s _meta_end_dot_

 military protection against coups or any other internal subversion _meta_end_dot_

 that s something the iraqi government wants desperately not only is it massively unpopular even among iraqi shiites but the increasing u s sunni security cooperation strikes the shiite government with some justification as a recipe for a future coup _meta_end_dot_

 i ll be interested to see what the democratic hawks have to say about that _meta_end_dot_

 for a long time they ve been getting by with things like shawn brimley s formula that the next president will need options beyond simply leave asap and stay the course this though relies on a strawman characterization of bush s policies to generate the sense of separation from the administration _meta_end_dot_

 the question here isn t whether we should literally stay the course the question is whether or not we should undertake an open ended commitment to propping up whatever form of iraqi government will agree to pay host to our military bases _meta_end_dot_
