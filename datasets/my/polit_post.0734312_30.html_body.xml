 goss who has since left _meta_end_dot_

 any country would have the former official involved in the operation said _meta_end_dot_

 but we did slow the program but as isaac chotiner points out the lede is that the cia launched a secret program in _meta_number_ref_ designed to degrade iran s nuclear weapons program and the national intelligence estimate s new conclusion is that iran s nuclear weapons program was mothballed in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 how could the cia s activities have slowed an iranian program that had already been put on hold _meta_end_question_
