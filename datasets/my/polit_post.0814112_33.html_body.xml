  dave weigel writes about liberal bloggers eager to back bob barr as an anti mccain spoiler _meta_end_dot_

 you can sign me up _meta_end_dot_

 there s a certain number of people who aren t going to be on board for john mccain s vision of authoritarianism in support of endless war at home and endless war in support of authoritarianism abroad but who also just aren t going to be very sympathetic to barack obama _meta_end_dot_

 if push comes to shove i think obama can get most of those people to vote for him _meta_end_dot_

 but i d rather push didn t come to shove give traditionalist small government small r republican conservatives their bob barr to vote for and the obama will win and the gop might shift in a more product direction over the medium term _meta_end_dot_
