  this daily news article on hillary clinton s hawkish advisors doesn t advance the ball very far but it s good to see the issue bubbling into less elite circles _meta_end_dot_

 it s also noteworthy for the fact that lee feinstein the top foreign policy guy on the campaign staff and thus presumably in job for a second tier nationals security post has a very silly response to these complaints a lot of obama s advisers thought this was a stupid war in _meta_number_ref_ and a lot of hillary s advisers thought it was a good idea in _meta_number_ref_ said one democrat with a national security r sum _meta_end_dot_

 that s the original sin which causes people to make some choices the campaign s advisers reflect a broad spectrum of opinion within the democratic party countered clinton national security guru lee feinstein _meta_end_dot_

 the candidate makes her own decisions about her foreign policy positions uh huh _meta_end_dot_

 of course she makes her own decisions _meta_end_dot_

 but that s the point she decided that invading iraq was a good idea and her team is mostly made up of people who agreed with her _meta_end_dot_

 the concern isn t that dick holbrooke and feinstein are controlling her mind _meta_end_dot_

 the concern is that she s working with the people she s working with because their thinking reflects her own thinking _meta_end_dot_

 and advisors are worth taking a look at because experts tend to lay their ideas out in the press in more detail than do politicians _meta_end_dot_

 clinton for example just hasn t clearly said one way or another whether or not she believes unilateral preventive war is a good basis for non proliferation policy _meta_end_dot_

 but she did authorize the use of force against iraq and several of the people working for her on a high level have taken clearer stands in favor of preventive war so it s natural to refer to them in raising the issue _meta_end_dot_

 simply noting in response that clinton makes her own decisions of course she does doesn t dispel one s doubts that she s not being clear about these issues because her beliefs on these matters aren t things democratic primary voters will agree with _meta_end_dot_
