  there s something hilarious about the tone of this washington post analysis article on the stimulus package _meta_end_dot_

 basically the theme of the piece is that bipartisanship is good that passing legislation is good and that bipartisanship is good because it makes it easier to pass legislation which is good _meta_end_dot_

 lost in the fog somewhere is the point that it s better to pass good bills than bad ones and that this stimulus package is a pretty bad one _meta_end_dot_

 indeed the cbo estimated that the most effective stimulus idea would be a temporary boost in food stamps _meta_end_dot_

 they concluded that the second most effective stimulus idea would be an increase in the duration of unemployment benefits _meta_end_dot_

 democrats proposed both of those things _meta_end_dot_

 but republicans wouldn t go along with either _meta_end_dot_

 so in order to make the bill bipartisan the best idea was stripped out _meta_end_dot_

 and so was the second best idea _meta_end_dot_

 i don t necessarily blame the democrats for making the compromises necessary to get a bill passed but the fact of the matter is that bipartisanship made this bill worse than a one party bill would have been _meta_end_dot_
