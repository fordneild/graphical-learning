  kevin drum notes that contrary to what you might think john mccain won in florida without really solving his base problem at all _meta_end_dot_

 he lost self identified conservatives and he lost self identified republicans too kevin remarks does anyone seriously think that any republican candidate can kick such major ass among independents in november that he can afford a conservative base that s not charged up and working feverishly to turn out every last vote _meta_end_question_

 i don t well no neither do i _meta_end_dot_

 does anyone seriously think that any democratic candidate is more likely than clinton to ensure a conservative base that s charged up and working feverishly to turn out every last vote _meta_end_question_

 i don t _meta_end_dot_
