  kevin drum points out that for a guy who s super concerned about global warming tom friedman doesn t seem to follow the issue at all writing the following in a fake memo representing iran s take on the united states true thanks to nancy pelosi the u s _meta_end_dot_

 congress decided to increase the miles per gallon required of u s _meta_end_dot_

 car fleets by the year _meta_number_ref_ which took us by surprise but we nevertheless strongly believe this will not lead to any definitive breaking of america s oil addiction since none of the leading presidential candidates has offered an energy policy that would include a tax on oil or carbon that could trigger a truly transformational shift in america away from fossil fuels _meta_end_dot_

 sure sure none of the leading presidential candidates have done that _meta_end_dot_

 except that friedman might have wanted to note that john edwards came out with a proposal to fully auction carbon permits in the context of a cap and trade scheme aimed at aggressive emissions reductions which is the same thing _meta_end_dot_

 for that matter barack obama came out with the same proposal _meta_end_dot_

 and um hillary clinton _meta_end_dot_

 so rather than none of the leading presidential candidates favoring such measures all of the democrats have proposals that would do this _meta_end_dot_

 to me this kind of pundit fuck up declining to give credit to people who deserve it is probably the most damaging kind _meta_end_dot_

 for better or for worse friedman s become one of the leading voices on climate change and energy issues _meta_end_dot_

 and he s a very influential columnist _meta_end_dot_

 people probably read him hoping to see which politicians if any someone who finds his columns convincing should be supporting _meta_end_dot_

 in this case they should be strongly favoring whoever wins the democratic nomination _meta_end_dot_

 but friedman won t say so _meta_end_dot_

 instead in order to reach a pox on both houses conclusion he finds himself ignoring the very strong similarity between auctioned permit plans and carbon tax plans _meta_end_dot_

 but if this is the treatment candidates stake out bold eco friendly positions are going to get from prominent advocates then who s going to bother _meta_end_dot_

 you can be sure the fossil fuel industry knows which politicians are their friends and which aren t _meta_end_dot_

 the ones who aren t need people to have their backs not to just get slandered coming and going _meta_end_dot_
