  there s been something a bit odd about scanning the news all day and seeing all these accounts of media people lecturing the audience that contrary to the opinions of the people who watched the debate last night that the performance of the debate moderators was in fact very good _meta_end_dot_

 if voters don t think the debate focused on important interesting topics then too bad for them _meta_end_exclamation_

 if voters don t think the debate was informative then too bad for them _meta_end_exclamation_

 the press once again gives itself a standing ovation and that s what matters _meta_end_dot_

 on an unrelated note i ve been in about a million conversations navel gazing conversations about the decline of old media like newspapers magazines and network television and never once has anyone suggested that declining audience might be in any way related to the quality of the product _meta_end_dot_

 everyone knows that it s the public s duty to read newspapers whether they find them useful and informative or not _meta_end_dot_
