  i ve suffered from a deepening obsession with denmark in general and copenhagen in particular for months _meta_end_dot_

 more recently passover reminded me that hard boiled eggs are a delicious snack _meta_end_dot_

 and now the new york times brings it all together everything is red inside bordello like bo bi bar klareboderne _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ the faded baroque style wallpaper the threadbare curtains the smoke soaked lampshades and especially the swollen grinning faces of the numerous regulars _meta_end_dot_

 few bars in copenhagen draw such a diverse crowd which on a recent night included _meta_number_ref_ something cool kids _meta_number_ref_ something intellectuals and some thin ageless barflies with names like ole and jonas _meta_end_dot_

 founded in _meta_number_ref_ this city center institution remains resolutely old school _meta_end_dot_

 cellphones may not be used inside digital cameras can be used only with permission and the marquee attraction on the three item food menu is hard boiled eggs _meta_end_dot_

 they re a good food when you re drunk says the bartender nanna sarauw _meta_end_dot_

 they get people straight these days though i assume that buying a beer at a bar in copenhagen is prohibitively expensive for those of us holding u s _meta_end_dot_

 currency _meta_end_dot_
