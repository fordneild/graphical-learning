  richard kahlenberg observes that it would be politically savvy of barack obama to embrace a shift toward class based affirmative action and that the logic of several things his said over the years seems to point in this direction _meta_end_dot_

 i tend to think so as well and have been hopeful that this might happen at some point but then i read this noam scheiber article focused on another topic and saw this graf the run up to south carolina was rife with talk that post racial obama was morphing into a decidedly pre post racial candidate _meta_end_dot_

 to reverse the slide blogger mickey kaus suggested he give a speech embracing class rather than race based affirmative action something obama had flirted with in the past _meta_end_dot_

 kaus had a point the atmospherics would have been irresistible to ambivalent whites _meta_end_dot_

 i pushed a milder form of the idea on my own blog _meta_end_dot_

 not long after i got a response from an obama adviser never gonna happen _meta_end_dot_

 urging sister souljah politicking on him was the surest way to provoke a scowl _meta_end_dot_

 well that s that _meta_end_dot_

 but in the hopes of persuading people otherwise i wouldn t really see this as sister souljah politicking to me the defining feature of the s s _meta_end_dot_

 stunt was that on the merits it was silly _meta_end_dot_

 the point was just to show that bill clinton was picking a fight with black people which proved he wasn t one of those nasty ol liberals _meta_end_dot_

 but shifting from the current system of affirmative action to one with a firmer grounded in actual socioeconomic disadvantage would especially paired to a broader critique of other dimensions of privilege legacy admissions etc be the right thing to do on the merits _meta_end_dot_

 and a black politician would be the right person to lead the charge the current system isn t sustainable over the long term and it would be much better to see it dismantled by someone with genuine concern for social justice than to go down at the hands of someone intent on fanning the flames of racial resentment and then leaving every other inequity in the education system unchallenged _meta_end_dot_
