  as best i can tell nobody can quite figure out what s happening in iraq right now nobody sure who did what that led to the current fighting or exactly who s fighting whom _meta_end_dot_

 thus we get reporting about how the fighting threatened to destabilize a long term truce that had helped reduce the level of violence in the five year old iraq war once a giant battle is already under way it seems a bit late to worr that a cease fire might be threatened but that s a sign of how confused the situation is _meta_end_dot_

 the international crisis group s old report on shiite politics in iraq remains a vital backgrounder if you re interested _meta_end_dot_
