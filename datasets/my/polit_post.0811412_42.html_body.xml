  yesterday i speculated that michael o hanlon was trying to wheedle his way into john mccain s good graces because he s burned his bridges with leading democrats _meta_end_dot_

 that still might be true as far as the presidential candidates go he s criticized clinton and obama by name repeatedly and obama especially harshly but since writing that i ve got some second hand reports that he s still briefing congressional democrats and the like _meta_end_dot_

 if that s true i really do wish people would look elsewhere for their expert advice _meta_end_dot_
