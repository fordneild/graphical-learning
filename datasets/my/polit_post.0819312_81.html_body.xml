  i m doing a debate discussion with peter beinart about the future of liberal foreign policy that you can read in progress hosted at the progressive book club _meta_end_dot_

 the progressive book club if you haven t heard is both a book club for progressives and also a club for progressive books _meta_end_dot_

 if you get my meaning _meta_end_dot_

 a much needed new institutions that should help get progressive ideas out there in the mainstream support progressive authors and hopefully give readers something worth reading _meta_end_dot_

 if you join you get discounts on books including heads in the sand of course and so forth so check it out _meta_end_dot_
