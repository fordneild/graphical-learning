  the latest washington post poll does give some support to those who think the significance of the iraq issue is in decline _meta_end_dot_

 still it s pretty scant support _meta_end_dot_

 this poll still has iraq essentially tied with economy jobs as the most important issue in the public s mind _meta_end_dot_

 i think what we see here is that if the economy keeps getting worse that really might push iraq off the front burner _meta_end_dot_

 still according to the post iraq has way more salience as an issue than does immigration even though the press have been pestering candidates with non stop immigration questions and downplaying the war _meta_end_dot_

 meanwhile re reading beinart and brooks i think i have a clearer sense of what they re trying to do _meta_end_dot_

 both peg the declining fortunes of rudy giuliani and hillary clinton though in her case i m not really convinced her fortunes actually are declining to this alleged decline in public concern about iraq _meta_end_dot_

 one might more parsimoniously attribute the declining fortunes of each party s most hawkish candidate to either coincidence or else to the declining public appeal of hawkish policies but that wouldn t do _meta_end_dot_

 instead the hawks suffer because people don t care as much about national security _meta_end_dot_

 because caring about national security is identical to being hawkish _meta_end_dot_

 very serious stuff _meta_end_dot_
