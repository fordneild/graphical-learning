  dave berri looks at the wizards surprising resilience in the face of gilbert arenas injuries _meta_end_dot_

 the insight that caron butler has been playing really really well will surprise nobody _meta_end_dot_

 he does note however that brendan haywood is simply taking more shots from the line and the field _meta_end_dot_

 and perhaps surprising to some the increase in haywood s shot attempts has not caused his shooting efficiency to decline and since haywood was always a fairly efficient scorer this has helped thus validating my longstanding decree that eddie jordan needs to play haywood more _meta_end_dot_

 beyond that is there any evidence agent zero is missed _meta_end_question_

 yes but it s free throw attempts where we see an impact _meta_end_dot_

 last year this team took _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ free throw attempts per game _meta_end_dot_

 this year the team is only taking _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ shots from the line each game _meta_end_dot_

 that s a pretty big difference _meta_end_dot_
