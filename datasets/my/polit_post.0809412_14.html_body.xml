  the _meta_number_ref_am conceit is nonsensical in this context but good for hillary clinton breaking stride with the general tenor of the democratic campaign and going after john mccain i will say however that i d rather see democrats attack mccain early on national security _meta_end_dot_

 mccain is very unpersuasive on economics this is the weak point of his reputation with the national press corps and democrats have a lot of ex ante credibility on the issue _meta_end_dot_

 it s on security stuff where mccain has a glowing but utterly undeserved reputation that desperately needs some tarnishing _meta_end_dot_

 still good for clinton _meta_end_exclamation_
