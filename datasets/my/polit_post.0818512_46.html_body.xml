  rasmussen has obama beating mccain _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ in montana _meta_end_dot_

 eric kleefeld comments democrats can be very successful at the state level here they have the governorship and both senate seats but the presidential vote has historically been much tougher to crack _meta_end_dot_

 the state has voted democratic only twice in the last _meta_number_ref_ years the lyndon johnson landslide of _meta_number_ref_ and bill clinton narrowly winning its three electoral votes in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 what s interesting to contemplate here is the role of effort _meta_end_dot_

 democratic senate candidates in montana campaign in montana _meta_end_dot_

 democratic gubernatorial candidates in montana campaign in montana _meta_end_dot_

 i don t believe that democratic presidential candidates typically do campaign in montana _meta_end_dot_

 but barack obama has been putting some resources into the state _meta_end_dot_

 and there s long been a real question in my mind as to how much of the gap at the presidential level can be made up merely by showing up _meta_end_dot_

 now that said there s a good reason democrats don t normally campaign in montana which is that in addition to having a conservative track record it has very few electoral votes so it s hard to imagine it being the pivotal state _meta_end_dot_

 but this kind of thing does have governance institutions _meta_end_dot_

 if obama were to win the election but lose montana by the same _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ margin that kerry faced then senators baucus and tester are going to take that into account when considering how supportive of obama s legislative agenda they ought to be _meta_end_dot_

 if it s close or if obama wins then they face a different calculation _meta_end_dot_

 that kind of thing is the significance of playing for the landslide _meta_end_dot_
