  i know this blog has gotten pretty horseracy as this race keeps on going but i ve still got a lot to learn if i want to be a bigtime media player _meta_end_dot_

 yesterday for example peter slevin and shailagh murray did an article for the washington post on barack obama s economic plan _meta_end_dot_

 well it was sort of an article about obama s economic plan _meta_end_dot_

 the headline was obama s economic plan is a pitch to the working class _meta_end_dot_

 basically it referred to obama s economic plan but didn t say anything about it _meta_end_dot_

 obama s economic plan calls for infrastructure bank _meta_end_question_

 no _meta_end_dot_

 obama s economic plan calls for credit card reform no _meta_end_dot_

 but that s just the headline _meta_end_dot_

 journalists don t write our own headlines _meta_end_dot_

 maybe if you decide to scan the article you can a taste of what sort of measures were included in obama s plan _meta_end_dot_

 here s the lede sen _meta_end_dot_

 barack obama offered a detailed prescription for the ailing u s _meta_end_dot_

 economy wednesday answering skeptics who contend he has not matched his inspirational talk with a mastery of policy and targeting voters in crucial primaries in wisconsin ohio and texas _meta_end_dot_

 up until the comma we re doing well here _meta_end_dot_

 we learn that obama offered a detailed plan _meta_end_dot_

 but after the comma we don t learn any of the details _meta_end_dot_

 the next six grafs are all about the political context obama s momentum the looming primaries obama s need to expand his appeal to working class voters _meta_end_dot_

 in graf eight john mccain accuses obama of offering platitudes in grafs nine and ten obama fires back accusing mccain of flip flopping on taxes _meta_end_dot_

 in graf eleven clinton echoes mccain s attacks _meta_end_dot_

 in graf twelve the fact that obama delivered a speech on the economy gets re iterated _meta_end_dot_

 in graf thirteen we learn that obama says he ll pay for the plan by ending the war in iraq and rolling back tax cuts _meta_end_dot_

 in graf fourteen the clinton campaign quotes a mccain advisor as calling the plan plagiarism finally in the fifteenth graf of an article about obama s economic plan we get something resembling a description of the content of the plan the newest element of his proposal was the establishment of a national infrastructure reinvestment bank which would spend _meta_dollor_ref_ billion over a decade to rebuild deteriorating roads bridges and waterways _meta_end_dot_

 obama said the spending would generate _meta_number_ref_ million new jobs many of them in a construction industry that has been hard hit by the housing market downturn _meta_end_dot_

 i don t know whether obama s campaign was helped or hindered by this strange way of covering the plan _meta_end_dot_

 maybe his efforts to make inroads are being stymied since the ideas he was hoping to help him make them are being muffled by focus on the political context _meta_end_dot_

 or maybe his efforts are being boosted because the details wouldn t really sway people but random chatter about obama doing detailed working class stuff is sends the right message _meta_end_dot_

 my guess is probably the latter this is more helpful to obama than a straightforward description of the infrastructure bank proposals it would allow the government to account for infrastructure spending as a kind of investment rather than an expense on continuing operations it s the kind of distinction companies usually make between capital spending and operating expenses but it s really no good for the country _meta_end_dot_
