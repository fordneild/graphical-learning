  ta nehisi obama vs _meta_end_dot_

 insertinterestgrouphere is the standard story for big media these days _meta_end_dot_

 it began over year and half ago here at home with this trumped up question of blackness heh peter bienert memorably called it good black vs _meta_end_dot_

 the bad black that one still makes me laugh _meta_end_dot_

 i don t think i ll ever forget shelby steele going on hardball to proclaim that because hillary clinton on the basis of her identification with al sharpton was in many ways blacker than barack obama _meta_end_dot_

 steele wasn t alone deborah dickerson stanley crouch and andrew young all played on the same theme _meta_end_dot_

 all of these cats are over fifty and i think were reflecting a notion of race that had been shaped by the culture wars _meta_end_dot_

 when obama declared his presidency they simply applied to him the same rules they d used in the _meta_number_ref_s and _meta_number_ref_s with no sense that things had changed _meta_end_dot_

 the not black enough line was lazy thinking that backed up this idea that we spend our days thinking about white people and all the ways we can make them feel guilty _meta_end_dot_

 now we have moved on to obama vs jews obama vs _meta_end_dot_

 appalachia and obama vs _meta_end_dot_

 women _meta_end_dot_

 i was thinking about this after i read e j _meta_end_dot_

 dionne s piece which is one in a series of articles that warns of potential backlash among women voters against obama _meta_end_dot_

 much like the not black enough stories the piece is based mostly on anecdotes and punditry _meta_end_dot_

 one thing i ve learned in my time doing this job is that you can string together five or six quotes about nearly anything _meta_end_dot_

 i could probably get seven or eight accredited scientists to tell me ufos existed _meta_end_dot_

 i don t think there s much of question as to whether gender sexism affected the election _meta_end_dot_

 the need for pundits to comment on hillary s appearance has always seemed bizarre to me _meta_end_dot_

 but i m leery of confusing anecdotes from a few voluble hillary supporters with women voters en masse _meta_end_dot_

 on average barack obama lost the female vote to clinton by six points _meta_end_dot_

 in many states like vermont virginia missouri and utah he actually won the female vote _meta_end_dot_

 in wisconsin he tied clinton _meta_end_dot_

 thus this idea that there are great numbers of women who really believe that clinton was robbed strikes me as also as hokum _meta_end_dot_

 media feeds on conflict and the flatter the conflict the easier it is to write _meta_end_dot_

 but one of the great revelations of this election is how diverse america really is _meta_end_dot_

 we tend to get hung up on small but important factors like obama s problem in appalachia _meta_end_dot_

 but i m just going to level with you there is no way i thought a black man would ever carry oregon and iowa and then also get _meta_number_ref_ percent of the black vote _meta_end_dot_

 what that says to me is that there is so much out there that i really don t know _meta_end_dot_

 and that i also should stop blogging so much and get out more _meta_end_dot_
