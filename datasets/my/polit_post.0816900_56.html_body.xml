  watch in amazement as john mccain fails to realize that a cap and trade system necessarily involves a mandatory cap on carbon emissions _meta_end_dot_

 obviously the root of the issue here is that mccain doesn t understand anything about carbon policy and doesn t care about it either _meta_end_dot_

 but he wanted to sign up for a centrist solution on the sexy issue of climate change so his staff came up with a plan _meta_end_dot_

 but mandatory cap sounds like the lefty position so mccain thinks he must not have it _meta_end_dot_

 maybe he should explain to people the real difference between his plan and barack obama s namely that under obama s plan you need to pay the government for carbon permits whereas under mccain s plan polluters get free permits that they can then sell _meta_end_dot_

 either way energy s going to get more expensive and some hardship will exist but under obama s plan revenue will be generated that can be used to ease the pain _meta_end_dot_

 but of course to explain his plan to people mccain would need to get someone to explain it to him first _meta_end_dot_
