  it s been a hectic day so i haven t had a chance to note that elton brand decided to sign with the philadelphia _meta_number_ref_ers rather than re up with the new la clippers featuring baron davis _meta_end_dot_

 that means another trip to the lottery for the clips and it also means the creation of a philly squad that s pretty damn good by eastern conference standards _meta_end_dot_

 boston and detroit still seem better but brand and andre iguodala is a solid inside outside combination andre miller s been underrated for years and samuel dalembert is a solid role player _meta_end_dot_

 if this means thaddeus young can start at the three with iguodala sliding over to shooting guard thus plugging the big hole in their starting lineup _meta_end_dot_
