  steve simon has a great article in foreign affairs putting things like the awakening strategy in a proper historical and strategic context arguing that rather than a success in a state building mission in iraq we re bolstering the centripetal forces that are tearing the country apart the problem is that this strategy to reduce violence is not linked to any sustainable plan for building a viable iraqi state _meta_end_dot_

 if anything it has made such an outcome less likely by stoking the revanchist fantasies of sunni arab tribes and pitting them against the central government and against one another _meta_end_dot_

 in other words the recent short term gains have come at the expense of the long term goal of a stable unitary iraq
