  i had never heard of the uncanny valley until i read tyler cowen and jason kottke blog it today _meta_end_dot_

 the basic idea is that when you get quasi human images cartoon people talking animals etc _meta_end_dot_

 they get more appealing to audiences as they become more human like _meta_end_dot_

 more appealing that is until they become too human while still not quite looking right at which point they become repugnant _meta_end_dot_

 so animators who know they can t perfectly replicate human appearance actually go out of their way to avoid getting too realistic _meta_end_dot_
