  some of us have been wondering where rudy giuliani was planning on getting the manpower to staff his foreign policy of endless war _meta_end_dot_

 it turns out that the plan is school vouchers rudy proposes establishing a pilot program to offer scholarships to children of all active duty military personnel living on or off base to attend private schools or to pay for the costs of attending public schools to which they are not assigned _meta_end_dot_

 this is a critical concern for america s military families because it affects reenlistment decisions _meta_end_dot_

 this is a bit bizarre since america s military base schools are really good and the recruiting issues in the military are clearly driven in the first instance by the prospect of arduous service in a futile war rather than by these kinds of considerations _meta_end_dot_

 but what you have here is a classic example of a solution in search of a problem _meta_end_dot_

 as kate sheppard points out giuliani s all choice all the time education policy initiatives say nothing whatsoever about the vast majority of children who are going to be in traditional public schools come what may _meta_end_dot_

 the problem here is that vouchers are the only solution rudy has to sell but there s really very little the federal government can do to induce towns and cities around the country to privatize their school systems _meta_end_dot_

 giuliani could take the path of conservative purity and just argue that the federal government should withdraw from education policy entirely but he doesn t want to say that _meta_end_dot_

 so instead he s looking around for things the federal government can voucherize _meta_end_dot_

 and one of the main things he came up with was military schools _meta_end_dot_

 so who cares if this is a bad idea it shows his commitment to conservative orthodoxy and that s the important thing _meta_end_dot_
