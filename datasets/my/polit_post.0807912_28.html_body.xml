  max bergmann says of john mccain s al qaeda iran mix up that is not a gaffe _meta_end_dot_

 that is called believing something that isn t true _meta_end_dot_

 it is called being confused _meta_end_dot_

 and being confused about the differences between shia and sunni when claiming that you should be elected president of the united states on your foreign policy knowledge and experience is simply not okay _meta_end_dot_

 this is a big deal _meta_end_dot_

 yes it is a big deal especially because as ezra klein notes mccain has a fairly aggressive policy take on iran and the long time belief that they were an al qaeda safeground may have contributed to his thinking quite so _meta_end_dot_

 certainly the iranian nuclear issue would look very different if i thought the iranian government were training al qaeda operatives on a regular basis and working hand in glove with them in iraq _meta_end_dot_
