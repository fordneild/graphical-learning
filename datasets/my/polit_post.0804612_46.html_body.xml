  i mentioned e j _meta_end_dot_

 dionne s new book souled out when i got my copy but let me recommend the ongoing discussion of the book over at tpm cafe _meta_end_dot_

 it s one of the most interesting faith and politics discussions i ve seen _meta_end_dot_

 read alexia kelley here and you ll see a side of the religious left that strikes me as a bit creepy and illiberal it is particularly tempting for people who are privileged to have a seat at important tables to forget that our task is nothing less than making god s kingdom real but also extraordinarily powerful in its vision _meta_end_dot_

 but you ve also got your brass tacks election analysis about the relevance of religion to people s voting patterns and the need for any viable political coalition to engage with that aspect of people s lives _meta_end_dot_
