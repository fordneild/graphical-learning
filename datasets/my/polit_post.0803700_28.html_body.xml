  on the democratic side everything seems to be basically playing out as expected _meta_end_dot_

 since as expected involved clinton winning bigger states than the ones obama would win she ought to emerge with a lead in delegates _meta_end_dot_

 but obama seems to have poached connecticut from her column and held it close in new jersey so the delegate count ought to remain well within reach unless clinton pulls off some kind of blowout in california _meta_end_dot_
