  to return to what i was saying in yesterday s post about the idea that bush has taken democracy promotion to a whole new level another thing i point out in heads in the sand is that wrapping a foreign policy of aggressive militarism in the rhetoric of idealism isn t some awesome innovation of george w _meta_end_dot_

 bush or bill kristol or dick cheney or anyone else _meta_end_dot_

 that s just what political leaders who want a foreign policy of aggressive militarism do _meta_end_dot_

 back during the days of victorian imperialism policies of conquest and subjugation were always justified in very high minded terms _meta_end_dot_

 what bush is doing is no different from that _meta_end_dot_

 lately some advocates of an imperial foreign policy for the united states have taken to admitting as much writing admiringly about the high ideals and humanitarian aims of e g the british empire _meta_end_dot_

 i think all that s wrong as far as both the u s _meta_end_dot_

 in iraq and the british in india or back in the day the u s _meta_end_dot_

 in the philippines are concerned but there s barely even any reason to doubt that it is or was insincere _meta_end_dot_

 it takes a certain kind of nationalistic hubris to think that a policy of domination is being undertaken for the good of the dominated but hubris and egomania are hardly unknown traits in human psychology _meta_end_dot_

 besides which i think the evidence indicates that the kind of domination oriented policies bush is pursuing aren t even good for the would be dominators _meta_end_dot_

 it s a huge screw up _meta_end_dot_

 what it s not however is a triumph of a new form of dreamy idealism i should use my army to rule the world through fear and intimidation is the oldest idea in the history of statecraft it s just not a very good one _meta_end_dot_
