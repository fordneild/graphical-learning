  it seems the good people of exxonmobil have seen fit to advertise on my blog and far be it from me to question the sincerity of a giant oil company when it says it s interested in developing new technologies to generate cleaner energy _meta_end_dot_

 it is however always worth saying that using less energy is probably the cleanest energy option out there _meta_end_dot_

 one way to achieve that would be for our country to become much much poorer but there s a lot of variation among countries of comparable wealth _meta_end_dot_

 denmark for example consumes _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ kilograms of oil equivalent per capita whereas germany consumes _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ france consumes _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ belgium consumes _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ finland consumes _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ and the united states consumes _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ over twice as much as denmark _meta_end_dot_

 and the danes and germans aren t living in circumstances of abject poverty or anything _meta_end_dot_

 if every american lived in a somewhat smaller house and spent less money on both the house and heating cooling lighting it and more money on fancy shoes or platinum cable packages or expensive organic produce we d be just as well off and the planet would be better off _meta_end_dot_

 we just happen to have a lot of public policy in place that encourages lavish energy consumption big houses low density land use many cars when policy should probably discourage such consumption or at a minimum be neutral about it _meta_end_dot_
