  i adhere to a lot of outr notions about the desirability of introducing massive socialism into our health care system and not satisfying ourselves with a lot of tinkering around the edges with subsidies and regulations and just having the government provide health care to people as a public service just as we have roads and police departments and all the rest and just as you can hire a security guard or build a driveway people could also do whatever _meta_end_dot_

 there is after all tons of evidence in favor of such a system from the awesome cost efficiency of the uk s national health service to the massive amounts of ineffective spending to of course the excellent quality of the va system _meta_end_dot_

 i remember reading philip longman s washington monthly article that he later expanded into a book on the va system and expecting the end to be something like so as you can see even though it s not politically practical at the moment what we really need to do is adopt massive socialism instead though he waxed all pragmatic _meta_end_dot_

 which i guess is fine _meta_end_dot_

 but still the ponit should be made that we really ought to adopt massive socialism _meta_end_dot_

 fortunately someone or other got the widely respected congressional budget office to do some research into the va system leading to this pdf interim report _meta_end_dot_

 cbo director peter orszag summarizes in general va s experience underscores the potential for improving performance in a large and relatively integrated system through a sustained and comprehensive effort that involves indicators of quality financial incentives that are aligned with those objectives and the use of health information technology _meta_end_dot_

 it is important to note though that the combination of these factors a large relatively integrated system well designed incentives performance measurement and health information technology likely creates much more substantial opportunities for improvement than any of the pieces taken by themselves _meta_end_dot_

 the applicability of va s experience to other parts of the health system which often have a much different structure than the va system is therefore unclear and will be explored in cbo s final report which will be published next year _meta_end_dot_

 in short massive socialism works but the applicability of its success to other models is unclear thus the case for massive socialism _meta_end_dot_

 but yes nobody wants to hear it _meta_end_dot_
