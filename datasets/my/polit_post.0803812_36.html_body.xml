  i liked this tyler cowen post so much i decided to quote the whole thing a new cato study by indur goklany suggests that instead of carbon taxes we should spend money on better water policy drought prevention anti malarials sea level protection and so on _meta_end_dot_

 in general we should make the world as wealthy as possible _meta_end_dot_

 here is the link the piece is intelligent throughout and well worth reading _meta_end_dot_

 two questions suggest themselves _meta_end_dot_

 first is the choice either or _meta_end_question_

 i don t see arguments against a revenue neutral carbon tax _meta_end_dot_

 second is there really enthusiasm for the proposed measures or is the real intent to do little or nothing on carbon _meta_end_question_

 since this is both a goklany piece and a cato piece an interesting question arises who exactly is now obliged to push for anti malarial foreign aid _meta_end_question_

 cato _meta_end_question_

 goklany _meta_end_question_

 either or _meta_end_question_

 both _meta_end_question_

 or is it enough to just make the comparison once and leave it at that _meta_end_question_

 one way to raise the money necessary to spend money on better water policy drought prevention anti malarials sea level protection and so on would of course be through a carbon tax or more politically realistic an auction of tradable carbon emissions permits _meta_end_dot_

 meanwhile there s an issue of consistency here _meta_end_dot_

 the style of argument here is don t do x because if we did z which costs as much as x we would see more benefits _meta_end_dot_

 that s a very stringent standard to meet _meta_end_dot_

 can goklany s own argument meet it _meta_end_question_

 is collaborating with libertarian think tanks to oppose carbon restrictions really the most efficacious method of boosting spending on anti malarials _meta_end_question_

 as best i can tell historically cato s only been interested in malaria as a pretext to complain about ddt regulations _meta_end_dot_

 now i suppose we can add carbon regulations to the list _meta_end_dot_

 but actual malaria related advocacy doesn t seem to be on the agenda _meta_end_dot_

 why not say we should eliminate all these subsidies and tax breaks for oil gas and coal firms and use that money to finance better water policy drought prevention anti malarials sea level protection and so on _meta_end_question_

 meanwhile if the planet just keeps getting hotter and hotter with more and more carbon in the atmosphere forever surely at some point it overwhelms are capacity to adapt _meta_end_dot_
