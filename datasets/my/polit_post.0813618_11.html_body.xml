  unlike tim lee i haven t read ben clemens book math you can t use _meta_end_dot_

 indeed i just now heard of it for the first time _meta_end_dot_

 but good title _meta_end_exclamation_

 and it s a good subject for a book the case against software patents _meta_end_dot_

 this is not an issue that s on most people s radar screens but the growth of software patents is a wholly unjustified trend that threatens to put a perpetual drag on the global economy _meta_end_dot_

 maybe i ll buy the book _meta_end_dot_
