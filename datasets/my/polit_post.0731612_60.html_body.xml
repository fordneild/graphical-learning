  eric schmitt and ginger thompson bring us broken supply channel sent weapons for iraq astray which sounds pretty dull _meta_end_dot_

 the story though is not by all accounts the businessman kassim al saffar a veteran of the iran iraq war did well at distributing the pentagon supplied weapons from the baghdad police academy armory he managed for a military contractor _meta_end_dot_

 but co workers say he also turned the armory into his own private arms bazaar with the seeming approval of some american officials and executives selling ak _meta_number_ref_ assault rifles glock pistols and heavy machine guns to anyone with cash in hand iraqi militias south african security guards and even american contractors _meta_end_dot_

 this was the craziest thing in the world said john tisdale a retired air force master sergeant who managed an adjacent warehouse _meta_end_dot_

 they were taking weapons away by the truckload it seems to me that when you re trying to establish security in a foreign country that making sure your own people aren t complicit in supply weapons to the enemy ought ought to be a pretty high priority _meta_end_dot_
