  intrepid commenter alex on this very site cracked the code that revealed the dc for obama t shirt that dcist had previously reported did not exist _meta_end_dot_

 now they say the shirt still isn t included on the main state shirt page of the obama online store however _meta_end_dot_

 should we have been able to figure out that it was hidden there all along _meta_end_question_

 perhaps _meta_end_dot_

 should we have had to _meta_end_question_

 at the very least it s sloppy web design so be that as it may my friends that s still not change you can believe in hideous scowl _meta_end_dot_

 john mccain could design a better page and he doesn t even know how to use a computer _meta_end_dot_
