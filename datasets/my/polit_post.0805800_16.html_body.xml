  christopher maag does an interesting piece for time magazine on the contrast between the clinton campaign organization in ohio dominated by the patronage networks of state and local officials and the obama organization which is an impressive quasi spontaneous grassroots phenomenon carefully cultivated by the obama campaign _meta_end_dot_

 the basic frame of the piece is that obama s approach is better but since the voting s not done yet maag s careful to include a hedge i only started calling my people last week said state senator dale miller a democratic stalwart on cleveland s west side _meta_end_dot_

 in retrospect if i had started a week or two earlier we would be better off now miller s organization remains formidable however _meta_end_dot_

 he spent the last few months calling hundreds of supporters asking them to volunteer for clinton and tracking those who seemed responsive _meta_end_dot_

 he visited every neighborhood democratic club in his district at least once filling his clipboard with new volunteers _meta_end_dot_

 the people i know may not be huge in number but they are the people who are the most active in their neighborhoods says miller _meta_end_dot_

 clearly i think either approach could work _meta_end_dot_

 but what i think is interesting is the different implications for governing _meta_end_dot_

 if a president clinton wants to pressure some ohio members of congress into casting a tough vote they don t really want to cast she has a lot of tools at her disposal for bringing them to heel _meta_end_dot_

 one thing she can t do however is generate pressure based on her local political organization in ohio _meta_end_dot_

 after all it s not her organization it belongs to the state and local elected officials and she just borrows it from them _meta_end_dot_

 obama by contrast may have that option _meta_end_dot_

 and what s more it s a technique that can work behind enemies lines as it were against republican members of congress whose districts don t include any entrenched incumbent democrats with their own organizations _meta_end_dot_

 will obama in fact find a way to extend his campaign tools to the art of governing and political pressure _meta_end_question_

 there s no way to tell _meta_end_dot_

 but he might _meta_end_dot_

 and much like his approach to campaign it d be a huge game changer _meta_end_dot_

 on some level after all it s sort of irrelevant whether or not obama s outsider organizing methods are actually superior _meta_end_dot_

 he didn t have the option of being the establishment candidate _meta_end_dot_

 what we know is that his organizing methods were effective enough and at the end of the day much more effective than the organizing methods of any previous presidential candidate _meta_end_dot_
