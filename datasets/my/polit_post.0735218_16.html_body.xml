  i d been optimistic that the release of the newer national intelligence estimate on iran and the apparent ascendancy of a more rational point of view within the bush administration might lead to a more cooperative attitude from russia with regard to the continuing concerns about iran s enrichment activities _meta_end_dot_

 that seems to not be the case as russia goes through with a nuclear fuel delivery that had been stalled for a bit _meta_end_dot_

 the bush administration is taking a restrained line presumably because they don t want the russians to start considering bad behavior on the iran front an important point of national pride and principle but this is definitely a step in the wrong direction _meta_end_dot_
