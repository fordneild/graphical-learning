  you d think it wouldn t be possible to actually break new ground in the field of ridiculous anti clinton news coverage but josh gerstein deserves some kind of medal for this piece taking a close look at her summer internship when she was in law school in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 the real gold comes on the second page where we learn that the most eye catching claim about mrs _meta_end_dot_

 clinton s time at the treuhaft firm is that she attended a plea negotiation on behalf of armed black panthers who stormed into the california legislature on may _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ to protest a gun control measure one interesting thing about this claim is that it s false _meta_end_dot_

 the case in question was resolved in _meta_number_ref_ and clinton worked for the firm in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 but one of the partners at the firm seems to have misremembered this and felt that he drove with hrc to sacramento for the hearing _meta_end_dot_

 gerstein dedicates seven full paragraphs to this even though it s stupid bullshit and clearly not true anyway before launching into a paragraph that begins regardless of whether mrs _meta_end_dot_

 clinton was on hand for the panthers legislature case regardless indeed _meta_end_dot_
