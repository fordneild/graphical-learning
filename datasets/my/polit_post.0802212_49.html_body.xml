  you ve probably heard about the democrats fundraising edge thus far in terms of congressional campaign committee fundraising _meta_end_dot_

 well brad plumer notes that that edge will be blown way out of the water if sheldon adelson s freedom s watch outfit really spends _meta_dollor_ref_ million on the _meta_number_ref_ elections _meta_end_dot_

 it s always worth keeping in mind that inequality in the united states has allowed certain concentrations of wealth to exist that in principle mean things could get really crazy _meta_end_dot_

 adelson could decide that _meta_dollor_ref_ million is chump change and that he actually wants to spend five billion dollars on the _meta_number_ref_ election and then give _meta_dollor_ref_ billion to each of his five children and then then live very comfortably for the rest of his life on his remaining _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ billion _meta_end_dot_

 now i m not saying that s going to happen but it could _meta_end_dot_

 and adelson s only _meta_number_ref_ on the forbes _meta_number_ref_ list _meta_end_dot_
