  charles krauthammer the shiite menace the washington post may _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ before the war even began the critics were predicting that iraq was going to be the bay of pigs plus desert one beirut and somalia said the ever hyperbolic chris matthews _meta_end_dot_

 a week into the war we were told iraq was vietnam _meta_end_dot_

 now after the war they re telling us that iraq is iran that iraq s shiite majority will turn it into another intolerant islamic republic _meta_end_dot_

 the critics were wrong every time _meta_end_dot_

 they are wrong again _meta_end_dot_

 of course there are telegenic elements among the shiites who would like fundamentalist rule by the clerics _meta_end_dot_

 but even the majority of iranians oppose the rule of the mullahs and consider the islamic revolution a disaster _meta_end_dot_

 the shiite demonstrators in iraqi streets represent a highly organized minority many of whom are affiliated with infiltrated by and financed by tehran the headquarters for _meta_number_ref_ years of the supreme council for the islamic revolution in iraq _meta_end_dot_

 these iranian oriented shiite extremists are analogous to the soviet oriented communists in immediate post world war ii italy and france _meta_end_dot_

 they too had a foreign patron _meta_end_dot_

 they too had foreign sources of money agents and influence _meta_end_dot_

 they too had a coherent ideology _meta_end_dot_

 and they too were highly organized even before the end of the war _meta_end_dot_

 they too made a bid for power _meta_end_dot_

 and failed _meta_end_dot_

 these days of course krauthammer would have nothing but scorn for anyone who doesn t want to see american troops fighting killing and dying for an indefinite period of time all for the sake of sciri s hold on power _meta_end_dot_
