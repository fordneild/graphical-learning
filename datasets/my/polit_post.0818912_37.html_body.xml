  this week is economy week for john mccain so it s worth giving some more scrutiny to mccain s economic policy proposals _meta_end_dot_

 for example suppose that you like so many americans in these topys turvey times are a large and hugely profitable oil company _meta_end_dot_

 your coffers are groaning under the weight of record profits driven by sky high commodities prices _meta_end_dot_

 and you earn your living by poisoning the planet all the while plowing a share of your profits back into bribes to ensure that the policy environment leaves most people with few viable alternatives to purchasing your product _meta_end_dot_

 you ve got a tough life and john mccain has a plan for you a reduction in the corporate tax rate from _meta_number_ref_ percent to _meta_number_ref_ percent _meta_end_dot_

 the five largest oil companies in america would collectively save _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ billion per year under this plan offering some change you can believe in if you re an exxonmobil executive _meta_end_dot_

 but don t worry it s not as if he only has plans for oil executives _meta_end_dot_

 no _meta_end_dot_

 suppose you re in your late fifties or early sixties and looking to retire soon but worried you won t be able to since so much of your wealth was tied up in your house and now the market s gone soft _meta_end_dot_

 well never fear john mccain has a plan to cut your social security benefits in an unknown manner and by an unknown amount in order to balance the budget in the face of his huge corporate tax cut _meta_end_dot_

 after all who needs social security when you can retire on a senator s pension plus live off your heiress wife s vast fortune _meta_end_question_

 in a world where the typical family owns eleven houses and lets their dependent kids spend _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ per month on mommy s credit card there s no real role for the government in providing retirement security _meta_end_dot_
