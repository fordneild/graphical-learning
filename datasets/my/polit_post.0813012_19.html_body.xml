  i just took my first ever ride in a meter equipped dc cab _meta_end_dot_

 it wound up costing almost precisely what it would have cost under the old zone system _meta_end_dot_

 but if i d want to travel a bit further it would have cost marginally more _meta_end_dot_

 similarly if i d wanted to take a slightly shorter trip it would have cost slightly less money _meta_end_dot_

 crazy idea _meta_end_dot_
