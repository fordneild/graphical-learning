  now that we re seeing national polls featuring mike huckabee surging all the way into second place it s worth saying that i predicted a huckabee win in the gop primary months and months ago at an american prospect editorial meeting and then stupidly failed to write it down _meta_end_dot_

 but other people were there and i expect them to speak up and back up my story _meta_end_dot_

 all of which is to say that at this point i do think we need to start seriously considering the possibility that winning iowa would not only collapse the romney campaign but actually turn huckabee into a real contender _meta_end_dot_
