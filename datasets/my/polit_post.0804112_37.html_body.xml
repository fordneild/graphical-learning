  chris bowers is outraged by the prospect of superdelegates determining the winner of the democratic primary _meta_end_dot_

 kevin drum is blas _meta_end_dot_

 i ll take a middle ground view i think chris is right to think it d be a pretty bitter pill to swallow if that s how things shake out but the controlling principle here is that the rules are the rules the superdelegates business which seems to favor clinton is just the flipside of things like the michigan florida exclusion or the weird rules that let obama win nevada even while clinton had many more votes there s a lot of oddness in the nominating system and there s no point of plucking out any particular feature and slamming it as unfair as the process unfolds _meta_end_dot_

 conversely this stuff gets tweaked every cycle _meta_end_dot_

 the democrats have had this dumb superdelegate thing in there for a couple of decades now with people mostly not focusing on it because it never comes into play _meta_end_dot_

 well now it might come into play and it doesn t sit well with people _meta_end_dot_

 they ought to ditch the rule going forward _meta_end_dot_
