  it s always interesting to ask about people s subjective definitions of rich and an interesting token of how class stratified we ve become as a society that so many people in the top twenty percent of the income distribution tend not to think of themselves as rich _meta_end_dot_

 that said annual family income is a pretty crude metric of people s financial situation _meta_end_dot_

 the bottom end of the income distribution chart includes a lot of retired people who aren t necessarily poor in any intuitive sense _meta_end_dot_

 down there at the bottom you ve also got a certain number of students and people in apprentice like jobs entry level positions at political magazines that they re expected to quickly transition out of _meta_end_dot_

 as a result while _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ a year is good enough to put you in the top twenty percent it s not nearly good enough to put you in the top twenty percent of real grownups say people over _meta_number_ref_ who have full time jobs _meta_end_dot_

 and of course wealth matters here as well _meta_end_dot_

 there s a difference between someone earning _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ a year and someone who s the beneficiary of a trust fund that pays out _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ a year _meta_end_dot_

 there s also a difference between earning _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ a year free and clear and earning _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ a year while trying to pay off college and law school debts _meta_end_dot_
