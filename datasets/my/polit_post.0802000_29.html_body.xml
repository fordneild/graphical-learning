  this morning mitt romney had more delegates than john mccain _meta_end_dot_

 following today s primaries romney s lead has grown even larger because nevada has more delegates than south carolina and romney won a larger proportion of the vote in nv than mccain got in south carolina _meta_end_dot_

 naturally the press is declaring this a big win for mccain _meta_end_dot_

 i just saw howard fineman explain that there is no longer any strong candidate in the race to oppose mccain _meta_end_dot_

 nobody but the guy who s leading that is _meta_end_dot_

 i feel hugh hewitt s pain _meta_end_dot_
