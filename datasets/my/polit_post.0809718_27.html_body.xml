  bruce ackerman and oona hathaway note that the current legal basis for the u s _meta_end_dot_

 military operation in iraq is the second prong of the _meta_number_ref_ aumf which grants the president the authority to use the military to enforce all relevant united nations security council resolutions regarding iraq but here s the rub _meta_end_dot_

 the most recent u n _meta_end_dot_

 resolution expires on dec _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ and the administration has announced that it will not seek one for _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 instead it is now negotiating a bilateral agreement with the iraqi government to replace the u n _meta_end_dot_

 mandate _meta_end_dot_

 whatever this agreement contains it will not fill the legal vacuum _meta_end_dot_

 that s because the administration is not planning to submit this new agreement to congress for its explicit approval _meta_end_dot_

 since the constitution gives the power to declare war to congress the president can t ignore the conditions imposed on him in _meta_number_ref_ without returning for a new grant of authority _meta_end_dot_

 he cannot substitute the consent of the iraqi government for the consent of the u s _meta_end_dot_

 congress _meta_end_dot_

 but of course bush and john mccain want a permanent american military presence in iraq but they know congress won t authorize such a presence _meta_end_dot_

 hence the only solution available to them is to ignore the law and the constitution and just keep the troops _meta_end_dot_

 ackerman and hathaway suggest merely continuing the u n _meta_end_dot_

 resolution for another year which will give the next president a legal basis for doing whatever he s been granted a mandate to do since no matter who wins the troops can t be made to suddenly vanish in a puff of smoke in january _meta_end_dot_

 but obviously for that to happen the administration would need to concede that it lacks the legal and constitutional authority to ignore congress and they ll never do that _meta_end_dot_
