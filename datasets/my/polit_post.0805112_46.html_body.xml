  in his comments on kosovo s declaration of independence barack obama said kosovo s independence is a unique situation resulting from the irreparable rupture slobodan milosevic s actions caused it is in no way a precedent for anyone else in the region or around the world in response came a sneering and ignorant new york sun editorial among the lessons we ve gained from a life of foreign corresponding are that wars have consequences and that history has its ironies _meta_end_dot_

 as kosovars danced in the streets in joy and kissed the nearest americans and the united nations wrung its hands the son of the president who delivered the chicken kiev speech embraced change in the balkans _meta_end_dot_

 and the echoes of the words of the _meta_number_ref_st president against independence for the so called soviet so called socialist so called republics are coming from a democratic presidential candidate aquiver at the prospect that some other downtrodden countries might take hope from kosovo s example and seek to follow suit _meta_end_dot_

 as jonathan kulick points out the no precedent line is the standard declarative policy of the united states and its purpose is to protect america s ally georgia from the threat of russian backed secessionist groups in abkhazia and south ossetia _meta_end_dot_

 is it really the sun s view that the embrace of freedom requires responsible presidential candidates to sign on for vladimir putin s geopolitical schemes _meta_end_question_

 i assume not most likely they were just going for a cheap hit and couldn t be bothered to check what was going on _meta_end_dot_

 meanwhile do palestinians count among the world s downtrodden countries _meta_end_question_
