  marc ambinder posts the following data from pew along with the observation that it shows us that republicans like mccain and indeed they do _meta_end_dot_

 which from the viewpoint of professional status is pretty depressing news _meta_end_dot_

 after all conservative pundits hate john mccain _meta_end_dot_

 but if conservative pundits can t make self identified republicans dislike john mccain then maybe all pundits everywhere are powerless _meta_end_dot_

 i could try to console myself with the view that maybe bill kristol is just incredibly persuasive but i doubt that s right _meta_end_dot_

 rather i think the tendency is for people who participate in the political media to drastically to drastically overstate its importance _meta_end_dot_

 after all the only people who pundits can affect are the relatively small number of people who consume political punditry _meta_end_dot_

 what s more the consumers of political punditry are by definition people with an unusually strong interest in politics _meta_end_dot_

 but the people most open to persuasion are the people who don t take a strong interest in politics _meta_end_dot_

 on top of all that i think kevin drum s right that strident campaigning by a pundit tends to be ineffective and annoying _meta_end_dot_

 anyone who s undecided is undecided because their gut tells them it s a close call _meta_end_dot_

 table pounding does more to suggest that the pounder lacks perspective than it does to persuade _meta_end_dot_

 but if to be effective you can only try to nudge people gently then it s just going to be very difficult to have a large effect _meta_end_dot_
