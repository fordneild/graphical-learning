  tyler cowen relinked today to guest poster fabio rojas thoughts on barack obama from back in may _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 it reminded me that i d been meaning to do a rambling post on my early impressions of the now favorite for the democratic nomination _meta_end_dot_

 way back in the day when i was a writing fellow at the american prospect my fellow fellow was from illinois and she d been known to mention from time to time that there was this great up and coming state senator named barack obama running for us senator and that it was too bad the party establishment was trying to hand the nomination to some mediocrity named blair hull _meta_end_dot_

 this kind of fit into a notion that i d frequently tossed around with my friend dave _meta_end_dot_

 dave and i agreed that rhetorical skill was an underrated trait in achieving political success that a disproportionate number of skilled orators in the united states seem to be southern or african american and that therefore the general democratic aversion to nominating black candidates to run for office in majority white constituencies was likely depriving the country of some potentially very successful politicians _meta_end_dot_

 then i didn t think a ton about it but at this _meta_number_ref_ blogger breakfast event at the democratic national convention i met obama when he and i found ourselves jostling to get some breakfast meat at the buffet this is how i know he s not secretly a muslim he introduced himself asked if i was a blogger i said i was and he in a pretty honest and appealing conceded that his understanding of what a blogger was was a bit hazy but people told him it was important _meta_end_dot_

 then he gave a little talk about something and it didn t strike me as particularly memorable _meta_end_dot_

 later either that day or soon after i was in the fleet center s corridors soon before obama delivered the speech that really launched his national profile not with any definite views as to when i was going to head into the main part of the arena to start listening to speeches _meta_end_dot_

 i ran into bradley tusk who i worked for one summer when he was chuck schumer s communications director and who turned out at the time to be working for governor blagojevich in illinois _meta_end_dot_

 he said this obama guy was a great speaker and i should really check it out i made some kind of breakfast related joke and then in we went _meta_end_dot_

 the fleet center was much more crowded than it had been at comparable times on other nights so we wound up with really terrible seats _meta_end_dot_

 then came obama and of course he blew everyone away _meta_end_dot_

 what s the point of recounting this _meta_end_question_

 i have no idea but the sequence of events has always made me favorable disposed toward the guy for reasons that really have nothing to do with his suitability to be a president or a presidential candidate _meta_end_dot_

 on the other hand i had various opportunities to proclaim the guy the future of american politics and come away looking prescient but kept not really doing so a pattern in keeping with my generally poor powers of prognostication _meta_end_dot_
