  my initial response to the idea that women should pay lower tax rates than men was skeptical _meta_end_dot_

 but sara liked it so i read more _meta_end_dot_

 the abstract gender based taxation gbt satis es ramsey s optimal criterion by taxing less the more elastic labor supply of married women _meta_end_dot_

 this holds when di erent elasticities between men and women are taken as exogenous and primitive _meta_end_dot_

 but in this paper we also explore di erences in gender elasticities which emerge endogenously in a model in which spouses bargain over the allocation of home duties _meta_end_dot_

 gbt changes spouses implicit bargaining power and induces a more balanced allocation of house work and working opportunities between males and females _meta_end_dot_

 because of decreasing returns to specialization in home and market work social welfare improves by taxing conditional on gender _meta_end_dot_

 when income sharing within the family is substantial both spouses may gain from gbt _meta_end_dot_

 probably not a realistic option _meta_end_dot_
