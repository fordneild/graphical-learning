  as ever it s really striking to observe the difference between the audience generated questions and the journalist generated questions _meta_end_dot_

 wolf blitzer s main interest is in asking questions designed to put democrats on the wrong side of public opinion even if those questions are about things like driver s licenses or merit pay for teachers that aren t really under federal purview _meta_end_dot_

 efforts to reframe those questions by putting those topics in the larger context of immigration policy more generally or education more generally are derided as cowardly dodges _meta_end_dot_

 the point after all is to force a choice piss off an interest group or say something that could be used in a gop attack ad _meta_end_dot_

 the real people by contrast ask about problems in their lives _meta_end_dot_

 the mother of an individual ready reserve member wants to know about iran policy _meta_end_dot_

 the mother of an active duty soldier wants to know about military pay versus pay for military contractors _meta_end_dot_

 an arab american wants to know about racial profiling _meta_end_dot_

 then the candidates explain what they think about these issues _meta_end_dot_

 the voters are curious and want to learn where the candidates stand _meta_end_dot_

 blitzer doesn t care about informing the public about the issues he actually objects when candidates try to explain their views on broad immigration policy issues he s just interested in trying to embarrass the candidates _meta_end_dot_

 update great example _meta_end_dot_

 an audience member makes the sensible observation that the candidates haven t talked about the supreme court and asks them to say something about their approach to picking nominees _meta_end_dot_

 i d be interested to hear the answers to these questions _meta_end_dot_

 the journalists decide to change this isn t a pointed question about a roe litmus test gotcha _meta_end_exclamation_

 do democrats violate the no litmus test taboo or do they piss off feminists _meta_end_question_

 good work _meta_end_exclamation_

 blah _meta_end_dot_
