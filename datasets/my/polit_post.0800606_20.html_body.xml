  here s hillary clinton s argument about the inadequacy of merely talking about change but here barack obama argues that effective rhetoric and inspiration are in fact crucial to producing change ultimately the idea of running on a record of change or talking about how you ve been producing change for thirty five years which sounds like an overestimate how much change was she really bringing about at the age of _meta_number_ref_ seems destined to wind up having you offer a lot of paradoxical sounding phrases _meta_end_dot_

 just because polls show people want change doesn t mean you ought to just start inserting change constantly into your talk even if it winds up making you say funny sounding things _meta_end_dot_

 clinton s brand is experience and competence and those are good brands _meta_end_dot_

 as i side note i think her team is possibly reading the lines of causation wrong voters in iowa knew that change was obama s message and so people who showed up to vote for obama also told pollsters they were primarily interested in change _meta_end_dot_

 clinton voters by contrast are trained to talk about experience this kind of thing is i think a major failing of conventional polling methods which tends to fairly naively assume that respondents reported candidate preferences are built out of their reported character trait and issue preferences _meta_end_dot_

 it s likely however to be the other way around people who like candidate x come to embrace key parts of candidate x s argument _meta_end_dot_
