  kirk ellis one of john adams s writers is jumping into tnr s exchange on the series and provides some insight into the provenance of the accents on display in the series steve you also inquire as to origins of the hybrid accents we use in the series _meta_end_dot_

 from the beginning we wanted to emphasize that independence was a battle between british americans and their brethren in england not as so often depicted a conflict that pitted crown officers with plumy oxonian accents against patriots with full blown american dialects _meta_end_dot_

 all our research pointed to the fact that in written and spoken speech america was much closer to the mother country than had been acknowledged in past dramatizations _meta_end_dot_

 he says they provided capsule biographies of the different characters to the series dialogue coach to help them come up with something appropriate sometimes based on the insight that one s residence in america frequently depended on one s point of origin in england _meta_end_dot_

 virginia for instance was largely settled by residents of east anglia in terms of dialect and accent a very distinctive region ellis participation in this along with some other similar examples does raise some questions about the changing nature of the critical enterprise in the internet era _meta_end_dot_

 my sense is that traditionally creators have tended to shy away from direct intervention into critical debates about their work _meta_end_dot_

 but something about the seemingly informal nature of internet commentary seems to have subverted that rule so you re seeing much more of this kind of intervention _meta_end_dot_

 it has i think the potential for a distorting impact on our understanding of things since at the end of the day it s really not the creator s role to offer authoritative accounts of what a given work really was or is _meta_end_dot_
