  a moving column from ann friedman aka one blogger about the human stories of iraq fading from view the news outlets that still report from iraq rarely publish accounts of daily life there _meta_end_dot_

 rarer still are narratives from outside the confines of the green zone _meta_end_dot_

 sure we get snippets of information from iraqi reporters working with western journalists but most of the time iraqis voices come to us in the form of react quotes after a marketplace bombing or sectarian uprising _meta_end_dot_

 we don t see what it s like for iraqis to walk home from the scene of the violence then make dinner then put their kids to bed _meta_end_dot_

 we lack the humanizing power of detail _meta_end_dot_

 but between _meta_number_ref_ and _meta_number_ref_ almost all of those bloggers riverbend included left iraq out of fear for their safety _meta_end_dot_

 some continue to blog about the war but do so from places like philadelphia or amman and primarily rely on news accounts and updates they hear from relatives still in the country _meta_end_dot_

 meanwhile day to day stories of life under occupation have become much harder to find especially for readers who don t read arabic _meta_end_dot_

 there s more there read the whole thing _meta_end_dot_
