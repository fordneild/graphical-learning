  here s some coverage of john mccain s deplorable treatment of his first wife _meta_end_dot_

 basically she got into a horrible car accident that left her disabled at which point he had what seems to have been several affairs with different women before embarking on a months long courtship of his current wife _meta_end_dot_

 then he divorced his first wife and married number two who conveniently enough happened to have been a wealthy heiress _meta_end_dot_

 now i have ample other reasons for thinking barack obama would be a better president than mccain so i m not going to pretend that this is my key driving force _meta_end_dot_

 but i ll agree with nick beaudrot that i m really curious what the more explicitly family values oriented conservatives like ross douthat think of this particular story
