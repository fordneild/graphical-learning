  how much does the picture of urban school systems i was painting yesterday change if you look at race as an indicator of socioeconomic disadvantage rather than family income _meta_end_question_

 the answer is that even though studies show that race exhibits a substantial income independent influence on school achievement the qualitative picture is similar if instead of looking at how cities do with educating poor kids we look at how they do with black kids as you can see here nationwide performance by black children is pretty deplorable with _meta_number_ref_ percent rating as below basic but given that unfortunate baseline you can see that several urban school systems charlotte austin houston new york and boston are doing somewhat better than average while others are doing quite a bit worse than average _meta_end_dot_

 now it s worth saying that this way of slicing up the demographics is no substitute for a proper regression analysis _meta_end_dot_

 you can really see this if you look for example at white test scores where suddenly the otherwise poor performing dc public schools start looking good because the dc white population is unusually affluent and well educated compared to whites nationwide _meta_end_dot_

 unfortunately the data available to talk about in order to get city versus city detail is a little sparse _meta_end_dot_

 the naep tuda is the best way of getting apples to apples comparisons of different urban districts but it doesn t cover very many cities and doesn t let you get nearly as rigorous as would be desirable _meta_end_dot_

 still i believe the overall basic point holds _meta_end_dot_

 demographic factors have a large impact on educational outcomes _meta_end_dot_

 when you try to control for demographic differences suddenly big city school systems don t look uniformly dysfunction some are above average _meta_end_dot_

 but demographics aren t destiny some cities are doing much worse than others _meta_end_dot_

 beyond that on a nationwide basis poor children and non white children are doing unacceptably badly even in good school districts _meta_end_dot_
