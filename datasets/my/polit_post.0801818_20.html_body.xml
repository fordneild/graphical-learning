  if you dial the time machine back to april of _meta_number_ref_ hillary clinton was giving a speech at the economic club of chicago back when she was burnishing her centrist credentials and expecting a primary challenge from the right from mark warner or evan bayh _meta_end_dot_

 barack obama was at the time a young and promising senator _meta_end_dot_

 and clinton had a health care agenda including a bill on health care information technology she did with bill frist and working with newt gingrich because we actually agree that the private sector could demand much more accountability from the insurance industry and get it and the punchline and i m working with senator obama on his grand bargain bill offering american auto companies voluntary for retiree healthcare costs in exchange for their commitment to use the savings to build more fuel efficient cars _meta_end_dot_

 that would be this plan which is now i guess a forgotten relic of the past _meta_end_dot_
