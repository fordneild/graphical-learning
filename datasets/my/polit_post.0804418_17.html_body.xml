  i don t think this jason kidd trade is a very smart move for dallas _meta_end_dot_

 kidd is still a better point guard than harris but at this point in their careers the margin doesn t justify giving up so much additional stuff in order to get him _meta_end_dot_

 in particular when you swap kidd for harris you re getting better rebounding and defense in exchange for worse shooting _meta_end_dot_

 that s fair enough but the other players dallas is sending to the garden state are going to cost them defense and rebounding _meta_end_dot_

 on top of that trading young for old and giving away picks and expiring contracts in the process hurts your team s future _meta_end_dot_

 basically like phoenix dallas seems to be responding with panic to the lakers acquisition of pau gasol _meta_end_dot_

 but just because a conference rival improves doesn t mean that a trade that didn t make sense a month ago suddenly does make sense today _meta_end_dot_

 if andrew bynum returns healthy then the lakers will be a very difficult team to beat _meta_end_dot_

 there s nothing written into the fabric of the universe that guarantees there are any possible trades san antonio or dallas or phoenix can make to become better than la _meta_end_dot_

 oftentimes teams become very good because other teams agree to make stupid trades with them that s what happened with boston and that s what happened with la _meta_end_dot_

 teams in that situation can only hope that some other team wants to come along and make a one sided desperation deal _meta_end_dot_

 but instead of waiting cautiously and hoping for a sweetheart deal phoenix and now dallas are making panicky moves _meta_end_dot_

 it seems to me though that the one thing you never want to do in the nba personnel market is put yourself in a position where you feel like you have to do something _meta_end_dot_

 you have to move kevin garnett so you accept cents on the dollar _meta_end_dot_

 you have to sign a big ticket free agent so you give larry hughes a huge deal _meta_end_dot_

 you have to respond to recent big trades so you give away draft picks and depth in exchange for a smallish upgrade at the point _meta_end_dot_
