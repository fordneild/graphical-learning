  a reader observes i have the roger clemens brian mcnamee congressional hearings on the radio in my office _meta_end_dot_

 apparently all the democrats on the committee are going all out against clemens while all the republicans on the committee are only attacking mcnamee _meta_end_dot_

 who knew this was such a partisan issue _meta_end_question_

 oh and in case it wasn t already obvious to all dan burton is a freaking nutcase _meta_end_dot_

 apparently rep _meta_end_dot_

 clay eventually broke the pattern going after both sides with equal vigor _meta_end_dot_

 for my part i think congress ought to grow up and hold hearings on something important _meta_end_dot_

 update another correspondent writes waxman said he wanted to cancel the hearing but clemens s attorney wanted it fair enough _meta_end_dot_
