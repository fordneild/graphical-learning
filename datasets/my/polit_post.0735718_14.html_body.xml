  someone calling himself scylla decided to try waterboarding himself on an experimental basis to see if he thought it should qualify as torture i ll put it this way _meta_end_dot_

 if i had the choice of being waterboarded by a third party or having my fingers smashed one at a time by a sledgehammer i d take the fingers no question _meta_end_dot_

 it s horrible terrible inhuman torture _meta_end_dot_

 i can hardly imagine worse _meta_end_dot_

 i d prefer permanent damage and disability to experiencing it again _meta_end_dot_

 i d give up anything say anything do anything _meta_end_dot_

 seth roberts read the account and made some musings about human evolution this shows something non obvious we are hard wired to avoid drowning and like all good safety systems the system kicks in well before damage occurs _meta_end_dot_

 for such a system to evolve humans must have spent a lot of time in water deep enough to drown in _meta_end_dot_

 we don t now of course _meta_end_dot_

 the sheer fact of scylla s post the fact that waterboarding is torture isn t obvious shows this _meta_end_dot_

 all this scylla s initial ignorance what he experienced and concluded is consistent with the aquatic ape theory of human evolution and inconsistent with alternatives to that theory e g the savannah theory which assume no long aquatic phase _meta_end_dot_

 belief that the aquatic ape theory was probably true was one reason i started omega _meta_number_ref_ self experimentation which led to the discovery of very clear experimental effects _meta_end_dot_

 well someone else read that post and used google reader s new share function to flag it and then i read the post and though i already knew waterboarding was torture i d never heard of the aquatic ape hypothesis before so i ve been looking into that it seems that most scientists reject it for what sound to me like good reasons _meta_end_dot_

 all in all an excellent way to waste some time while semi watching the giants play the bills _meta_end_dot_
