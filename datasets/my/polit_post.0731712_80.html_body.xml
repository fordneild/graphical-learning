  looks like general petraeus is having meetings with some of muqtada al sadr s people which is the right thing to do in the context of any kind of overall strategy though it doesn t change the fact that the overall strategy is still wrong _meta_end_dot_

 meanwhile i don t know if ironic is the right word for it but it s noteworthy that the key things petraeus has started doing in _meta_number_ref_ are just things that the right would have labeled treasonous policies of retreat and defeat back in _meta_number_ref_ and _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 back then holding direct talks with insurgent groups and trying to reach compromises with them was anathema even though back then this kind of compromise oriented approach had much better prospects for success since the sectarian wells hadn t already been poisoned by the extreme sectarian violence of the intervening years _meta_end_dot_
