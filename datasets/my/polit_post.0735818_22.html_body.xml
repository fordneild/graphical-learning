  ezra klein who s much more sympathetic to the anti obama cause than i am says much of what needs to be said about paul krugman s overreaching effort to paint barack obama as an anti union candidate _meta_end_dot_

 but a few additional observations one this kind of thing is why i ll be glad when this primary race is over _meta_end_dot_

 the nominating contest creates large incentives to overstate one s case _meta_end_dot_

 in retrospect i think i ve been guilty of this with regard to hillary clinton _meta_end_dot_

 i prefer other candidates on foreign policy grounds _meta_end_dot_

 that s not to say however that she ll be the second coming of george w _meta_end_dot_

 bush which i think i ve wrongly implied in the past due to over investment in some internecine disputes _meta_end_dot_

 similarly it s one thing to say that you prefer edward s and clinton s views on health care and social security but that s a far cry from obama deserving the label of an anti change candidate _meta_end_dot_

 two john edwards is clearly the most pro labor candidate in this race _meta_end_dot_

 if i were a single issue voter this election wouldn t be a close call _meta_end_dot_

 and it s really too bad that more unions didn t line up behind edwards _meta_end_dot_

 instead many shied away from him on the theory that he was doomed to lose and that clinton was inevitable _meta_end_dot_

 that of course has something of a self fulfilling prophesy dynamic to it and created problems for edwards in terms of fundraising and national press _meta_end_dot_

 now as a non supporter of clinton with strong edwards sympathies i m worried that an edwards win in iowa just leads to a clinton victory whereas an obama win in iowa leads to an obama victory _meta_end_dot_

 had the unions all just lined up behind the most pro labor candidate in the field i don t think we would have that problem _meta_end_dot_

 three i don t see any need for liberal pundits to get in the business of denying that labor unions are in fact special interests indeed it s impossible to understand the dynamics of american politics without acknowledging them to be special interests _meta_end_dot_

 they re special interests who sometimes take the wrong side of policy debates when what s right for the country is wrong for the sector in which they work _meta_end_dot_

 the cwa often takes bad positions on telecommunications issues because it wants to advance the interests of unionized telecom firm vis a vis the interests of non union firms _meta_end_dot_

 similarly various unions have in the past clashed with environmental groups and will certainly do so again in the context of a serious push to curb carbon emissions _meta_end_dot_

 there s nothing wrong with that and liberals should strongly resist the line of inference from unions are sometimes wrong on public policy questions therefore we should embrace policies designed to hasten the decline of union membership but still unions are groups that seek to advance the interests of their members _meta_end_dot_

 as such they re a vital check on what would otherwise be corporate influence run amok _meta_end_dot_

 but sometimes the interests of a given union s members run against the general interests of the country and there s no sense in denying this _meta_end_dot_

 to return to point one though the whole krugman obama feud started over the issue of health insurance mandates _meta_end_dot_

 if you think that electing a president who favors an edwards clinton style individual mandate is likely to lead to a better substantive policy outcome than is electing an opponent of such a mandate then this constitutes a perfectly good reason all on its own to vote for edwards or clinton rather than obama _meta_end_dot_

 it s an important issue _meta_end_exclamation_

 there s not really any need to drag additional implausible charges into the mix _meta_end_dot_

 update on health care obama is consistently running to the right of his rivals is a much more accurate characterization of the complaint _meta_end_dot_

 i don t think the legislative prospects for a really awesome health care plan in _meta_number_ref_ are very good no matter who wins the election so i don t find this reality incredibly distressing _meta_end_dot_

 but it s an accurate complaint _meta_end_dot_
