  steve harrelson represents district _meta_number_ref_ in the arkansas house of representatives _meta_end_dot_

 he s also majority leader of the arkansas house _meta_end_dot_

 and he also writes a very comprehensive arkansas politics blog called under the dome this to me is a kind of fascinating development that potentially has a lot of promise for state and local officials who don t necessarily have big staffs _meta_end_dot_

 so i was glad to see that yesterday at dlc s national conversation he was one of the panelists on a breakout session for state and local elected officials talking about new social media unfortunately it seemed that there was virtually no interest in this from the audience _meta_end_dot_

 all anyone wanted to talk about was fear about what might go wrong on the internet _meta_end_dot_

 could one of my kids write something on their facebook page that embarrasses me _meta_end_question_

 what if i become the victim of unfair attacks from anonymous people writing online _meta_end_question_

 what about journalistic standards _meta_end_question_

 wither truth _meta_end_question_

 the whole litany of internet related fears _meta_end_dot_

 and i think you have to admit that these concerns have at least some validity _meta_end_dot_

 with any new significant technology you have your pros and your cons your positive developments and some negative ones _meta_end_dot_

 but to me it s just fundamentally crazy to look at the brilliant new communications tools of the internet and primarily see something to be frightened of rather than new opportunities to take advantage of _meta_end_dot_

 the good news i suppose is that at least as far as elected officials are concerned we should see a darwinian process _meta_end_dot_

 harrelson and others who start thinking about what new things they can do to communicate and connect with people should see more and more success while those who want to recoil in fear will see less and less _meta_end_dot_

 but this also speaks to a real potential opening for institutions state and local government has enormous weight as a whole and i suspect that whichever party or ideological tendency acts first to develop programs to make its people comfortable with new technologies and its possibilities can secure a real advantage _meta_end_dot_
