  i was of course joking below about hillary clinton s good chances among dc s mostly female mostly working class primary electorate _meta_end_dot_

 my working class neighbors and fellow districters are naturally mostly black and as such don t count as working class for the purposes of the media s electoral analysis and the clinton campaign has repeatedly emphasized that elections in states or pseudo state entities like dc and the virgin islands with too many black people don t count _meta_end_dot_

 still it s strange how wide this blackout net seems to have been cast _meta_end_dot_

 dc is one thing but the clinton campaign s conceit that a white person can t get ahead in the politics of maryland and virginia is just bizarre _meta_end_dot_

 senator ben cardin senator barbara mikulski governor martin o malley governor tim kaine and senator jim webb are all white democrats who ve had some success in the mid atlantic region _meta_end_dot_

 cardin even had to run against a black guy in the primary _meta_end_dot_

 it s true that maryland in particular has relatively few white people only texas new mexico california and hawaii are less white but plenty of white folks seem to be doing okay _meta_end_dot_

 the real truth of the matter is that clinton seems doomed in these states just because she s chosen to not seriously contest them _meta_end_dot_
