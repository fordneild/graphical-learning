  this is all very true _meta_end_dot_

 what s more it points toward a serious objective difficulty with our understanding of electoral politics _meta_end_dot_

 the the major party nominee who lost was obviously deeply flawed school of election analysis is clearly flawed but fundamentally the n for presidential elections is so tiny that unless you overinterpret the available data you wind up not being able to say anything at all _meta_end_dot_

 that in turn might be a good idea except i have the traffic stats to prove that nothing gets you the audience interested in political commentary like a good ol fashioned presidential campaign _meta_end_dot_

 thus there will be election related commentary _meta_end_dot_

 whereof one cannot speak thereof one must be silent works well if you were born into one of the most prominent and wealthy families in the austro hungarian empire but some of us need to work blog for a living _meta_end_dot_
