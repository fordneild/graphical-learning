  i sometimes feel like bomb iran is just a policy proposal walking around in search of a solution _meta_end_dot_

 mostly it s supposed to solve something related to their nuclear program but nobody can ever quite say what _meta_end_dot_

 sometimes it s for something to do with their meddling in iraq _meta_end_dot_

 here via tyler cowen we see shmuel rosner confront the fact that bombing iran isn t a good way of preventing them from getting nuclear weapons and come around to favoring bombing iran anyway according to this line of thinking which has adherents focusing on the tactical questions surrounding such an operation how much of iran s nuclear program can israel destroy _meta_end_question_

 how many years can a bombing campaign set the program back _meta_end_question_

 is a mistake _meta_end_dot_

 the main goal of a hit would not be to destroy the program completely but rather to awaken the international community from its slumber and force it to finally engineer a solution to the crisis any attack on iran s reactors as long as it is not perceived as a military failure can serve as a means of stirring the pot of international geopolitics _meta_end_dot_

 israel in other words wouldn t be resorting to military action because it is convinced that diplomacy by the international community cannot stop iran it would be resorting to military action because only diplomacy by the international community can stop iran _meta_end_dot_

 this honestly would be downright silly if not for the fact that bombing countries is per se a serious business _meta_end_dot_

 one likes to think that israel hasn t managed to survive this long in a dangerous neighborhood by being run by morons and thus this policy is going to be rejected _meta_end_dot_

 meanwhile as one can see here what s needed here are fewer rumors of war and more direct engagement by the united states in a serious diplomatic effort at a rapprochement with iran _meta_end_dot_

 israel s soi disant friends in the united states seem to get antsy at the prospect of anything resembling a real diplomatic initiative but it would clearly be the best thing for israel as well as for the us iran iraq and the world at large _meta_end_dot_
