  house democrats once again postpone a vote on holding josh bolten and harriet miers in contempt of congress for refusing to testify in the us attorneys matter _meta_end_dot_

 there s some kind of nominal rationale for this but an anonymous top democratic insider says when we have the votes we ll go ahead with this _meta_end_dot_

 right now the votes are just not there _meta_end_dot_

 basically we seem to have some fraidy cat dems out there who for some reason don t think picking a fight with the white house over their gross distortions of the rule of law would be a smart idea and then we have a weak leadership that for some reason doesn t want to bring them into line _meta_end_dot_
