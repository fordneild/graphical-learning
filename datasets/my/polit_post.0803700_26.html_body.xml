  i believe i ve noted before that i like mitt romney _meta_end_dot_

 like not just in a typical liberal i want our guy to run against the mormon kind of way _meta_end_dot_

 i like him _meta_end_exclamation_

 i think he d be a better president than john mccain _meta_end_dot_

 i voted for him in massachusetts in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 and right now i think he s delivering a pretty damn good speech _meta_end_dot_

 education policy expert sara mead says this isn t a winning message for him too negative but it taps into my anti beltway rage anti beltway rage only gets worse when you move all the way into the district of columbia and realize that the country is run by jerks who ride the orange line _meta_end_dot_

 that said i couldn t really get a handle on the feistiness of it _meta_end_dot_

 it s hard for me to see any way that he s not dead in the water _meta_end_dot_

 given the number of delegates mccain s been able to wrack up in big winner take all states he seems to me to have a nearly insurmountable lead _meta_end_dot_
