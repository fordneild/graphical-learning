  every couple of years i feel like i suddenly start reading articles about education in finland in american newspapers _meta_end_dot_

 this makes me think there s some kind of finland education policy junket that i want to be getting in on _meta_end_dot_

 on the merits finland seems to have approximately nothing to teach american educators except that education outcomes would be different if every aspect of american society were completely different from how they are in the real world _meta_end_dot_
