  marc ambinder takes a closer look at the lack of disclosure of who s donating to bill clinton s library and foundation _meta_end_dot_

 as i ve written before the clinton s really ought to engage in more disclosure here _meta_end_dot_

 they re legally within their rights to do what they re doing but the voters deserve to know _meta_end_dot_

 the clinton foundation s not a nickle and dime operation and it s not being funded by small grassroots contributions either _meta_end_dot_

 as best one can tell the donor list is full of corporate titans and foreign potentates and one can only assume that these people are giving in part out of an expectation that they re currying favor and getting access in political terms along with whatever charitable notions they may have _meta_end_dot_
