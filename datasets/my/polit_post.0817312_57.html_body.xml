  i heard part of a conference call the national security network organized yesterday about the negotiations for a status of forces agreement with iraq _meta_end_dot_

 skip gnehm who s been ambassador to kuwait australia and jordan as well as a deputy assistant secretary of state a deputy assistant secretary of defense and a number of other prominent positions made a couple of provocative points _meta_end_dot_

 one he points out that in all of my experience there are no sofa agreements that authorize military action in other words we have agreements with germany italy south korea turkey saudi arabia and other countries governing the presence of u s _meta_end_dot_

 military forces in those countries but none of them authorize the use of military force inside the host country or against the host country s citizens _meta_end_dot_

 analogies between the sofa the bush administration is putting together with iraq and standard alliance relationships are in other words totally invalid _meta_end_dot_

 the other point he made had to do with the problems historically that have been posed by pushing too aggressively for these basing deals _meta_end_dot_

 he said that britain had long had a security agreement with iraq but post wwii there was a moment in time when the british really insisted on the iraqis that they needed to extend that agreement which led to riots on the streets broad opposition across tribes and ethnic groups and eventually the prime minister had to flee the country _meta_end_dot_

 long story short british pressure undermined the government in iraq and undermined their own standing in the country here s wikipedia s account of the matter meanwhile britain attempted to legalize a permanent military presence in iraq even beyond the terms of the _meta_number_ref_ treaty although it no longer had world war ii to justify its continued presence there _meta_end_dot_

 both nuri and the regent increasingly saw their unpopular links with great britain as the best guarantee of their own position and accordingly set about cooperating in the creation of a new anglo iraqi treaty _meta_end_dot_

 in early january _meta_number_ref_ nuri himself joined the negotiating delegation in england and on _meta_number_ref_ january the treaty was signed _meta_end_dot_

 the response on the streets of baghdad was immediate and furious _meta_end_dot_

 after six years of british occupation no single act could have been less popular than giving the british an even larger legal role in iraq s affairs _meta_end_dot_

 demonstrations broke out the following day with students playing a prominent part and the communist party guiding much of the anti government activity _meta_end_dot_

 the protests intensified over the following days until the police fired on a mass demonstration _meta_number_ref_ january leaving many casualties _meta_end_dot_

 on the following dayt abd al ilah disavowed the new treaty _meta_end_dot_

 nuri returned to baghdad on _meta_number_ref_ january and immediately implemented a harsh policy of repression against the protesters _meta_end_dot_

 at mass demonstration the next day police fired again at the protesters leaving many more dead _meta_end_dot_

 the monarchy held on to power until the late _meta_number_ref_s at which point nuri was shot dead and buried that same day but an angry mob disinterred his corpse and dragged it through the streets of baghdad where it was hung up burned and mutilated now on the flipside the western oil companies who are securing no bid contracts in iraq are going to want to hire western security contractors to defend their interests and apparently one of the things the bush administration is pushing for is a continuation of the situation where legally unaccountable foreign mercenaries can be introduced into iraq willy nilly _meta_end_dot_
