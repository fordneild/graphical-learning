  ali frick notes michael goldfarb expressing some displeasure that the nyt editorial page s blog didn t like his candidate s dumb ads _meta_end_dot_

 here s goldfarb but in their new role as bloggers the paper s editors seem to have all the intelligence and reason of the average daily kos diarist sitting at home in his mother s basement and ranting into the ether between games of dungeons and dragons _meta_end_dot_

 now here s the thing _meta_end_dot_

 say what you will about rpg loving nerds but surely we recognize that these widely loathed creatures are the very same widely loathed nerds you could find in the bc calculus class taking ap physics or wasting time being taught turbo pascal _meta_end_dot_

 that s how we did things where i come from admittedly we played considerably more diplomacy than ad d but the principle is the same at least but i m pretty sure that s the widespread stereotype _meta_end_dot_

 you can t in other words mock the nerds in the basement as being too dumb it s just not right _meta_end_dot_

 meanwhile yes i assume that the nyt editorial board is not made up of folks who were the cool kids in high school _meta_end_dot_

 was goldfarb _meta_end_question_

 it doesn t sound likely but who knows _meta_end_dot_

 to speculate irresponsibly a bit a lot of mccain s fans seem to me to be nerds who instead of growing up and embracing their inner dungeon master have instead decided that hanging out with the jock will make people think they re cool too _meta_end_dot_
