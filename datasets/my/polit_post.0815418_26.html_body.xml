  one might think one would have to know what one was talking about to write an op ed for the washington post but of course if that were the case then robert samuelson would be unemployed unless we find cost effective ways of reducing the role of fossil fuels a cap and trade system will ultimately break down _meta_end_dot_

 it wouldn t permit satisfactory economic growth _meta_end_dot_

 but if we re going to try to stimulate new technologies through price let s do it honestly _meta_end_dot_

 a straightforward tax on carbon would favor alternative fuels and conservation just as much as cap and trade but without the rigid emission limits _meta_end_dot_

 a tax is more visible and understandable _meta_end_dot_

 if environmentalists still prefer an allowance system let s call it by its proper name cap and tax _meta_end_dot_

 we ll turn this over to ryan avent yowza _meta_end_dot_

 as any economist worth his or her salt will tell you a cap and trade plan with auctioned permits is essentially identical to a carbon tax _meta_end_dot_

 that also happens to be exactly what barack obama is proposing _meta_end_dot_

 so another way for samuelson to have written this column would have been to title it barack obama has a good plan to reduce carbon emissions this is of course also the view of hillary clinton john edwards leading congressional democrats and all the main environmental groups _meta_end_dot_

 but of course samuelson s the kind of guy for whom environmentalists and democrats are always wrong so we have to ignore the facts _meta_end_dot_
