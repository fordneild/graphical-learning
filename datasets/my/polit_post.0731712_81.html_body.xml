  i d highly recommend ed kilgore s thoughts on different approaches to the politics of national security available to democrats though i think his _meta_number_ref_ is something of a straw man whereas _meta_number_ref_ and _meta_number_ref_ are very real and vibrant strains of thought and the best way for going forward _meta_end_dot_

 what i would add though is that i m not sure how available ed s number five really is to those democrats who voted to authorize the use of force in iraq back in october _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 ed characterizes the best way forward as find ways to compete with republicans on national security without supporting their policies and positions e g the _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ clark graham right idea wrong target criticisms of the iraq invasion as distracting and undermining the legitimate fight against terrorists _meta_end_dot_

 i ll call it clark dean because i think dean s been unfairly maligned on this score and graham wound up articulating the really crazy view that we should go to war with hezbollah _meta_end_dot_

 but old fights aside we could also call it the john kerry at his best strategy saddam hussein didn t attack us _meta_end_dot_

 osama bin laden attacked us _meta_end_dot_

 al qaida attacked us _meta_end_dot_

 and when we had osama bin laden cornered in the mountains of tora bora _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ of his cohorts with him in those mountains _meta_end_dot_

 with the american military forces nearby and in the field we didn t use the best trained troops in the world to go kill the world s number one criminal and terrorist _meta_end_dot_

 the trouble is that this kind of message nicely re enforced by the fact that rand beers resigned from the bush administration in protest over the president s iraq strategy and wound up working for kerry cut against kerry s actually record _meta_end_dot_

 just a few sentences later kerry was shifting into an hrc like explanation of why his vote in favor of authorizing the war didn t mean he favored the war he also said saddam hussein would have been stronger _meta_end_dot_

 that is just factually incorrect _meta_end_dot_

 two thirds of the country was a no fly zone when we started this war _meta_end_dot_

 we would have had sanctions _meta_end_dot_

 we would have had the u n _meta_end_dot_

 inspectors _meta_end_dot_

 saddam hussein would have been continually weakening _meta_end_dot_

 if the president had shown the patience to go through another round of resolution to sit down with those leaders say what do you need what do you need now how much more will it take to get you to join us we d be in a stronger place today _meta_end_dot_

 this is in a vacuum plausible _meta_end_dot_

 it s not however consistent with the strategic focus argument since handling iraq kerry s way recall that there was a right way to hold saddam hussein accountable and there was a wrong way still would have entailed the shift in focus away from afghanistan al qaeda and pakistan and toward iraq _meta_end_dot_

 consequently while i think this sort of argument is a great one for barack obama and other challengers like jim webb who can easily adopt it folks who backed the war aren t that well positioned to do so because the strategic focus argument isn t really consistent with trying to wriggle away from a pro war record by citing the manipulation of intelligence _meta_end_dot_

 all of which is to say that while someone like dennis kucinich who opposed the iraq war because of an extremely dovish overall outlook would still have a very hard time winning an election someone like webb or obama or dean or clark who can plausibly claim prescient judgment about what s become an extremely unpopular war is just in a much fundamentally stronger position to go up against a candidate at either the presidential or congressional level who s be a die hard war supporter but not someone who was personally involved in the well known rumsfeld era cavalcade of ineptitude _meta_end_dot_
