  delivering a speech on iraq to mark the fifth anniversary of the war barack obama returns to the fundamental issue argument of his campaign history will catalog the reasons why we waged a war that didn t need to be fought but two stand out _meta_end_dot_

 in _meta_number_ref_ when the fateful decisions about iraq were made there was a president for whom ideology overrode pragmatism and there were too many politicians in washington who spent too little time reading the intelligence reports and too much time reading public opinion _meta_end_dot_

 the lesson of iraq is that when we are making decisions about matters as grave as war we need a policy rooted in reason and facts not ideology and politics _meta_end_dot_

 now we are debating who should be our next commander in chief _meta_end_dot_

 and i am running for president because it s time to turn the page on a failed ideology and a fundamentally flawed political strategy so that we can make pragmatic judgments to keep our country safe _meta_end_dot_

 that s what i did when i stood up and opposed this war from the start and said that we needed to finish the fight against al qaeda _meta_end_dot_

 and that s what i ll do as president of the united states _meta_end_dot_

 on the question of too little time reading the intelligence reports and too much time reading public opinion i often wonder what public opinion might have looked like had the war met with more vigorous opposition _meta_end_dot_

 certainly to me the fact that tom daschle dick gephardt hillary clinton joe biden etc _meta_end_dot_

 were supporting the war was an important consideration _meta_end_dot_

 if bush was lying about the intelligence i figured that those people who had access to classified data would be exposing the lies not going along with them _meta_end_dot_

 obviously that doesn t look like very smart reasoning in retrospect but i can t have been the only one who was swayed in part by the very fact of bipartisan support for the war _meta_end_dot_

 if democratic leaders had opposed it i imagine the war would have been much less popular _meta_end_dot_
