  via spencer ackerman leila fadel and hussein kadhim report for mcclatchy on the state of political reconciliation in iraq the new flag is done for a foreign agenda and we won t raise it said ali hatem al suleiman a leading member of the u s backed anbar awakening council if they want to force us to raise it we will leave the yard for them to fight al qaida a slim minority of parliamentarians approved the new flag which doesn t have saddam hussein s handwriting or the three stars that represented his sunni dominated baath party _meta_end_dot_

 the good news is that i assume our new friends aren t literally going to turn around tomorrow and fight alongside al qaeda over this flag issue _meta_end_dot_

 still if you re looking for a clearer indication that the awakening clc movement is not going to be the basis of national unity in iraq i don t think you need to look much further than this _meta_end_dot_
