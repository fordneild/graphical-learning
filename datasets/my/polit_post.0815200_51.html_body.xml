  alyssa so i think it s probably fair for me to guess that almost all of you have no idea what my employer government executive does _meta_end_dot_

 i didn t either until i started freelancing for them and discovered that this magazine catering to federal employees had almost _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ subscribers and web traffic growing in the direction of half a million unique visitors each month _meta_end_dot_

 i just had no idea the audience was out there because i never really bothered to think about it _meta_end_dot_

 but since i started covering federal workforce issues full time i ve learned two things one about journalism and one about government _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ niche publications may be an increasingly important part of journalism s future as long as the niche is of reasonable size _meta_end_dot_

 there are _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ million civilian federal employees not including postal service workers _meta_end_dot_

 that s a huge market and those readers are incredibly hungry for information about the conditions that govern their jobs _meta_end_dot_

 and by narrowing down our beats we get to do much deeper reporting than we might if we were at a publication that had a broader mandate _meta_end_dot_

 for example my colleagues robert brodsky and elizabeth newell took the new york times story on aey inc _meta_end_dot_

 ran with it and figured out the backstory behind how aey got labeled a disadvantaged business a status that proved crucial to the firm s success _meta_end_dot_

 the times had the story of what happened but elizabeth and rob figured out why _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ what s going on in the federal workforce right now is drastically under covered _meta_end_dot_

 huge numbers of career federal employees are about to retire especially in senior leadership ranks and hiring freezes in the _meta_number_ref_s mean there aren t enough people to move smoothly up the ranks to fill those vacancies _meta_end_dot_

 these circumstances are prompting a reform boom federal agencies are working to streamline the hiring process adopting alternate work schedules and telework policies and developing programs in coordination with nonprofits like the partnership for public service to reach recruits of all who wouldn t have considered federal service before _meta_end_dot_

 but those efforts may be too late to prevent disruptions to federal services and federal agencies _meta_end_dot_

 wonder why your plane is late _meta_end_question_

 it s partially airport capacity but it may also partly be due to a mass exodus of air traffic controllers _meta_end_dot_

 has it taken forever for you to get a passport _meta_end_question_

 the state department had to shift junior employees to process applications _meta_end_dot_

 upset about the u s _meta_end_dot_

 attorneys scandal _meta_end_question_

 the complexities of the relationships between political appointees and career federal employees provides key context _meta_end_dot_

 more stories than i ever realized come back to the people who work in government _meta_end_dot_
