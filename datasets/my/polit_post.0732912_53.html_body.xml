  mark steyn on john howard of all the doughty warriors of the anglosphere howard his foreign minister alexander downer and their colleagues had the best rhetoric on the present war and i often wished the bush administration had emulated their plain speaking _meta_end_dot_

 a better one sentence take on the hawk pundit view of the world could hardly be imagined _meta_end_dot_

 howard and downer aren t warriors they re politicians _meta_end_dot_

 and they re not steadfastly courageous that s an attribute of actual warriors who do fighting _meta_end_dot_

 indeed howard was also at pains to avoid tony blair s mistakes and not put much of anything actually on the line in iraq _meta_end_dot_

 but like the doughty war pundits of yore he offered solid rhetoric thus ensuring their spots in valhalla _meta_end_dot_
