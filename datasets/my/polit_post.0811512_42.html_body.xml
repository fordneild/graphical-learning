  patrick healy has an excellent article in the times making the point that it s illegitimate to make inferences of the form a lost state x in the primary therefore a will lose state x in a general election or a lost demographic y in the primary therefore a will lose demographic y in a general election if clinton loses demographic y that could be because their preference is obama clinton mccain or it could be that they think obama mccain clinton and their behavior in the obama clinton race doesn t give us any evidence _meta_end_dot_

 the best evidence we do have to test these claims is provided by the early general election polling matchups we can at least illustrate broad trends _meta_end_dot_

 according to gallup clinton and obama are both tied with mccain in head to head matchups against presumptive republican nominee mccain clinton and obama perform almost exactly the same _meta_end_dot_

 in gallup s latest tracking of the general election based on interviewing conducted april _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ mccain has a one point lead over both clinton and obama _meta_end_dot_

 in the april _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ usa today gallup poll both clinton and obama were slightly but almost identically ahead of mccain among likely voters _meta_end_dot_

 in neither instance is there any meaningful difference in how the two candidates stack up against mccain _meta_end_dot_

 obviously there s no way clinton could be tied with mccain without picking up the lion s share of obama supporters and there s no way obama could be tied with mccain without picking up the lion s share of clinton supporters _meta_end_dot_

 basically there s nothing to see here _meta_end_dot_
