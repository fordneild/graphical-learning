  one fascinating thing about the death of jesse helms is the conservative reaction _meta_end_dot_

 one might expect that helms death would prompt from conservatives the sorts of things that i might say if say al sharpton died that he and i had some overlapping beliefs and i don t regard him as the world historical villain that the right does but that he s a problematic guy and i regard him and his methods as pretty marginal to american liberalism _meta_end_dot_

 but instead conservatives are taking a line that i might have regarded as an unfair smear just a week ago and saying that helms is a brilliant exemplar of the american conservative movement _meta_end_dot_

 and if that s what the heritage foundation and national review and the other key pillars of american conservatism want me to believe then i m happy to believe it _meta_end_dot_

 but it reflects just absolutely horribly on them and their movement that this is how they want to be seen as best exemplified by bigotry lunatic notions about foreign policy and tobacco subsidies _meta_end_dot_
