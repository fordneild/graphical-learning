  i hadn t thought of this but it makes sense _meta_end_dot_

 jackie calmes reports for the wsj some in the clinton camp also noted a possible problem for a party unity ticket bill clinton may balk at releasing records of his business dealings and big donors to his presidential library you have to assume the obama campaign wouldn t agree to an obama clinton without without at least their own vetting team getting a crack at those books _meta_end_dot_

 and it seems very unlikely that obama would want to fight bill s battle for non disclosure to the public _meta_end_dot_
