  excellent essay from rasmus fleischer on the history of copyright and the tendency for the inability to perfectly enforce one regime to simply lead to demands for an ever more expansive vision of what needs to be enforced a very condensed version of copyright history could look like this texts _meta_number_ref_ works _meta_number_ref_ tools _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 originally the law was designed to regulate the use of one machine only the printing press _meta_end_dot_

 it concerned the reproduction of texts printed matter without interfering with their subsequent uses _meta_end_dot_

 roughly around _meta_number_ref_ however copyright law was drastically extended to cover works independent of any specific medium _meta_end_dot_

 this opened up the field for collective rights management organizations which since have been setting fixed prices on performance and broadcasting licenses _meta_end_dot_

 under their direction very specific copyright customs developed for each new medium cinema gramophone radio and so forth _meta_end_dot_

 this differentiation was undermined by the emergence of the internet and since about the year _meta_number_ref_ copyright law has been pushed in a new direction regulating access to tools in a way much more arbitrary than anyone in the pre digital age could have imagined _meta_end_dot_

 this domino effect captures the essence of copyright maximalism every broken regulation brings a cry for at least one new regulation even more sweepingly worded than the last _meta_end_dot_

 copyright law in the _meta_number_ref_st century tends to be less concerned about concrete cases of infringement and more about criminalizing entire technologies because of their potential uses _meta_end_dot_

 this development undermines the freedom of choice that creative commons licenses are meant to realize _meta_end_dot_

 it will also have seriously chilling effects on innovation as the legal status of new technologies will always be uncertain under ever more invasive rules _meta_end_dot_

 for a long time the whole question of how we deal with intellectual property has been relegated to something like fourth tier status decided in backrooms by a clash of special interests with almost no public debate or understanding _meta_end_dot_

 at the same time it s become clich to observe that we re now in an information economy and america is more and more becoming a country that exports media ideas design software etc _meta_end_dot_

 than one that exports planes and cars _meta_end_dot_

 consequently it s less and less viable to think that the regulation of ideas and content is irrelevant or unimportant these are key economic functions and whether or not they ll be organized to serve the narrow interests of people who current control certain channels of distribution is a huge issue _meta_end_dot_

 update case in point this terrible bill that the house just passed to its discredit which is supposed to step up enforcement of copyright by among other things establishing civil forfeiture penalties for devices that facilitate the violation of ip laws _meta_end_dot_
