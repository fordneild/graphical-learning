  laura rozen reports on conservative grumbling about sheldon adelson and freedom s watch _meta_end_dot_

 it hardly seems fair to me to blame adelson for not having single handedly created a moveon style mass movement _meta_end_dot_

 that s just not the kind of thing one person can do _meta_end_dot_

 and of course it took moveon years worth of campaigning to become the moveon that it is today _meta_end_dot_

 and beyond that the essence of the moveon project is to identify things that progressives are interested in that aren t being done aggressively by the existing infrastructure what the right seems to want is for a vast new organization to spring up to support exactly what they re doing right now _meta_end_dot_

 that of course is what every politician wants but it s not how you create a new grassroots movement _meta_end_dot_

 i bet that if a new grassroots movement were springing up on the right most pillars of the conservative movement would like it very much it d probably be huckabeeish or some other trend that s well represented in public opinion but poorly represented in dc _meta_end_dot_
