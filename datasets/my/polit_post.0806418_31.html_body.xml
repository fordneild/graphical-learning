  this is a provocative thought from richard florida s who s your city _meta_end_question_

 how the creative economy is making where to live the most important decision of your life which arrived in my mail yesterday t he way we house people today seems a bit out of sync with other demands of our highly mobile and flexible economy _meta_end_dot_

 the united states has long prided itself on being a nation of homeowners _meta_end_dot_

 we boast that more than _meta_number_ref_ percent of americans owns their homes _meta_end_dot_

 we encourage young people to save enough to buy one of their own _meta_end_dot_

 we provide all sorts of public incentives from tax write offs on mortgage interest to public investments in infrastructure to encourage home ownership _meta_end_dot_

 it is after all the centerpiece of the american dream _meta_end_dot_

 i can t help but wonder whether this dream doesn t belong to a bygone industrial era _meta_end_dot_

 a central element of the creative economy is its flexibility _meta_end_dot_

 people change jobs often _meta_end_dot_

 let s put it this way _meta_end_dot_

 one major attraction of investing one s savings in a home rather than in a broad index fund of stocks is that you can live in your house whereas the stocks are useless _meta_end_dot_

 but this introduces some rigidities into the economy which make it harder for workers to leave the places where nobody wants to hire them ohio michigan etc and go to the places where people are looking for more workers arizona florida _meta_end_dot_

 for one thing the transaction costs involved in selling your house are much greater than what s involved in leaving a rental property _meta_end_dot_

 similarly with buying a new one _meta_end_dot_

 but what s more the living in your retirement fund duality comes into play _meta_end_dot_

 if you re considering leaving michigan because it s economically depressed you re not alone _meta_end_dot_

 as a consequence your house probably isn t very valuable _meta_end_dot_

 if your stock investments tank there s nothing you can do about it _meta_end_dot_

 but if your home investment tanks you can still live there _meta_end_exclamation_

 unless that is you try to move _meta_end_dot_

 if you d been living in a rental and investing in the stock market you could liquidate some of your investments to help finance the move to a more vibrant area where housing costs and employment prospects are better _meta_end_dot_

 but if you spent your savings on your house then you re basically stuck _meta_end_dot_

 now obviously homeownership has some real value but when you consider factors like that it s not clear that we should be making it a policy priority to especially subsidize this one form of asset building over all others _meta_end_dot_

 in particular if you encourage people to live in their savings the tendency is to acquire more house than they otherwise might instead of a house plus some stock you buy a bigger house which compounds the economic rigidity issues and is bad for the environment to boot _meta_end_dot_

 florida suggests that residential leases might become more like commercial ones with longer term leases and more flexibility for tenants in terms of altering the property _meta_end_dot_
