  at this point i ve reached the conclusion that further criticism of hillary clinton s behavior from people who everyone knows prefer obama on the merits is useless and perhaps even counterproductive _meta_end_dot_

 what s needed is for people who prefer clinton on the merits to defect now that her campaign has lost and is continuing to engage in bizarre and reckless behavior _meta_end_dot_

 but i suppose it is worth noting that comparing her situation to that of the opposition movement in zimbabwe is a really offensive way of trivializing the work of some very courageous people _meta_end_dot_
