  ron brownstein nails why john mccain s whining and crying about mean ol liberals quoting his oft repeated dictum that he thinks our troops should stay in iraq for _meta_number_ref_ years rings so hollow he won t explain what he does think the future mission of our troops should be _meta_end_dot_

 as i ve said before mccain obviously isn t in a position to decide what our troops are doing in the _meta_number_ref_nd century but all indications are that he would keep on fighting the war throughout a four or eight year term in the white house _meta_end_dot_
