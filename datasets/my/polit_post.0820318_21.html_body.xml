  read the chart _meta_end_dot_

 and no highways don t pay for themselves _meta_end_dot_

 also there are large negative externalities associated with driving that militate in favor of making drivers subsidize transit users or pedestrians cyclists etc rather than the reverse _meta_end_dot_

 update of course you can t bring this subject up without legions of people informing you that the gas tax pays for the highways _meta_end_dot_

 this simply isn t true _meta_end_dot_

 all the funds raised by the gas tax are spent on highways and then a bunch of additional money is also spent on highways _meta_end_dot_

 it s exactly the same as with transit financed by a mix of user fees and subsidies in order to encourage the economic benefits of infrastructure investment _meta_end_dot_

 but one kind of investment is better for the environment and for public health _meta_end_dot_

 so naturally we give the other kind radically more money _meta_end_dot_
