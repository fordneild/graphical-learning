  interesting paper from dan hunter and john quiggin in the economy of the _meta_number_ref_st century economic and technical innovation is increasingly based on developments that don t rely on economic incentive or public provision _meta_end_dot_

 unlike _meta_number_ref_th century innovation the most important developments in innovation have been driven not by research funded by governments or developed by corporations but by the collaborative interactions of individuals _meta_end_dot_

 in most cases this modality of innovation has not been motivated by economic concerns or the prospect of profit _meta_end_dot_

 this raises the possibility of a world in which some of the sectors of the economy particularly the ones dealing with innovation and creativity are driven by social interactions of various kinds rather than by profit oriented investment _meta_end_dot_

 this article examines the development of this amateur modality of creative production and explains how it came to exist _meta_end_dot_

 it then deals with why this modality is different from and potentially inconsistent with the typical modalities of production that are at the heart of modern views of innovation policy _meta_end_dot_

 it provides a number of policy prescriptions that should be used by governments to recognize the significance of amateur innovation and to further the development of amateur productivity _meta_end_dot_

 one often underlooked element of the intellectual property debate is the ability of the ip regime to effect the balance _meta_end_dot_

 some things are done on a commercial basis and some are done on an amateur basis _meta_end_dot_

 strong ip makes it more difficult for commercial and non commercial actors alike to be able to innovate _meta_end_dot_

 it compensates for erecting this financial hurdle by creating unique financial incentives toward innovation incentives that only help a commercial actor _meta_end_dot_

 in a world with weaker ip more and more work should come from hobbyists amateurs and non profit organizations _meta_end_dot_
