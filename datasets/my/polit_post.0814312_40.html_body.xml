  another round on education and inequality incidentally this isn t all an academic discussion _meta_end_dot_

 the question of whether inequality is a simple function of education is important _meta_end_dot_

 if so then it can simply be solved by sending more people to school though that as matt does point out is very hard _meta_end_dot_

 if not then it s a function of any number of forces ranging from globalization to tax rates to corporate culture that might require more direct government intervention this is why folks like bush are invested in the education explanation and say things like the reason for inequality is clear we have an economy that increasingly rewards education and skills because of that education and david brooks writes columns that pin inequality entirely on the education gap the gap in education is a problem to be sure but it s been a long time since it was a plausible driver of the increase in inequality _meta_end_dot_

 i think this is a little crazy _meta_end_dot_

 yes some conservatives have overstated the role of the skill premium in growing u s _meta_end_dot_

 income inequality over the past _meta_number_ref_ years _meta_end_dot_

 but the fact that it s not all skill premium doesn t mean it s not partially skill premium _meta_end_dot_

 there are several different kinds of factors at work but inequality has grown in part because the proportion of people graduating from college hasn t kept pace with the growing labor market demand for college graduates _meta_end_dot_

 what s the sense in denying this _meta_end_question_

 similarly what difference does it make if the skill related component of growing inequality happened in the _meta_number_ref_s _meta_end_question_

 if it had happened in the _meta_number_ref_s and then been reversed that would be a good reason to ignore this element of the picture _meta_end_dot_

 but it happened in the _meta_number_ref_s and then has just stayed with us _meta_end_dot_

 but it should still be reversed _meta_end_exclamation_

 now i agree on top of the skill premium element of inequality the tendency of the top _meta_number_ref_ percent of the population to pull away from the top _meta_number_ref_ percent we ve also seen another phenomenon in which very tiny groups the top _meta_number_ref_ percent the top _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ percent etc pull away from the rest of the crowd _meta_end_dot_

 this is in many respects a troubling social phenomenon that calls for a policy response restoring the estate tax comes to mind but the other thing is also a troubling social phenomenon in its own right _meta_end_dot_

 meanwhile it s not at all clear to me why so many liberals have decided to agree that aspiring to increase the number of people who finish college should be coded as a conservative policy idea when the most promising solution is probably huge increases in public spending on early childhood education _meta_end_dot_

 nothing about doing that would stop us from also making it easier to organize unions or raising the minimum wage or whatever else _meta_end_dot_
