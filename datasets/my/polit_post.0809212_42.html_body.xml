  i alluded to the troubled financial situation in iceland yesterday but if you want a proper explanation check out claus vistesen s post at a fistful of euros which will explain what s happening _meta_end_dot_

 the comments thread meanwhile turned to an argument over whether or not it s correct to say that icelanders are descended from vikings _meta_end_dot_

 daga says this is a kind of slur its much like saying that all palestinians are terrorists _meta_end_dot_

 to go viking was an action neither a profession nor an ethnic entity _meta_end_dot_

 at the time it was either landnaam landgrabbing or pillaging depending on the strenght and size of the party _meta_end_dot_

 iceland was settled by people from the west coast of norway opposing our first king s unification og the country _meta_end_dot_

 normandy was settled for much the same reason this time by viking i e _meta_end_dot_

 by force _meta_end_dot_

 given that iceland was completely unoccupied at the time of norse settlement no aboriginal population whatsoever it would seem wrong to suggest that any landgrabbing was involved _meta_end_dot_

 my understanding is however that many of the settlers stopped off in ireland en route to capture slaves giving iceland s population its mixed nordic celtic character _meta_end_dot_
