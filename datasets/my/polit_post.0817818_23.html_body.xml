  nate silver created the above chart out of rasmussen data and it shows a fascinating difference between obama s relationship to his base and mccain s relationship to his _meta_end_dot_

 a pretty hefty chunk of democrats hate obama and are certain to defect to mccain _meta_end_dot_

 but an absolutely giant number of republicans feel kind of meh about mccain _meta_end_dot_

 as nate observes this is a perfectly fine situation for mccain to be in if it s a close election but if the election doesn t look like it s going to be close there could be a snowball effect in which republican turnout is quite low i d also say that this represents bob barr s opening to have an impact on the race all these republicans with mixed feelings about mccain could in principle be drawn to a different take on conservatism _meta_end_dot_
