  i don t expect much from the debates but _meta_number_ref_ minutes and counting without a single reference to anything even vaguely related to public policy _meta_end_dot_

 update still no policy at _meta_number_ref_ minutes _meta_end_dot_

 update okay good _meta_end_dot_

 now they re asking about iraq seems like the kind of third tier issue i d wait an hour to ask about _meta_end_exclamation_
