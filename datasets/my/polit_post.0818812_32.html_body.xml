  back on july _meta_number_ref_ jon chait predicted anway let me now go on the record to say that another mccain staff shake up is if not inevitable very likely _meta_end_dot_

 mccain s staff is just too factionalized to remain stable unless mccain is consistently winning _meta_end_dot_

 and schmidt is a bush _meta_number_ref_ veteran who lacks the deep emotional ties to the candiate that other mccainiacs have _meta_end_dot_

 i predict that at some point probably just before or just after the convention there will be a move to let mccain be mccain and new boss steve schmidt will be replaced with either john weaver or mike murphy to try to recreate the magic of the _meta_number_ref_ campaign _meta_end_dot_

 it took all the way until july _meta_number_ref_ for this story to surface in the nyt i think the depressingly self absorbed mccain campaign machine needs to get out of the way said mike murphy a longtime friend and media adviser who has no role in the current operation but who still talks to mr _meta_end_dot_

 mccain every few days _meta_end_dot_

 they need to just let mccain be mccain schmitt better close that lead in a hurry _meta_end_dot_
