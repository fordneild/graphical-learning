  looks like the dcpd s finally gone and busted up the prostitution ring working out of the washington plaza hotel in thomas circle _meta_end_dot_

 i wouldn t normally post on a local issue like that but these are the hookers that wizards f c andray blatche got arrested for soliciting _meta_end_dot_

 notwithstanding his troubles with the law blatche is having a breakout season in which he s catapulted himself from interesting prospect to okay player status so with any luck he can find himself a classier brand of call girl at this point _meta_end_dot_
