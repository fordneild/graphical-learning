  the wizards have been using gilbert arenas as the face of the franchise for a while but last season many fans came to suspect that caron butler might be the team s best player a theory their continued mediocrity success without arenas this season seemed to support _meta_end_dot_

 in terms of adjusted plus minus however antawn jamison s the man not only the best on the team but actually one of the most valuable players in the whole league _meta_end_dot_

 for that matter he looks great in terms of regular plus minus too _meta_end_dot_

 these stats can be misused because they make a player s quality in part a function of the quality of his backup but i think they do provide a useful perspective given how much of the game s action doesn t seem well captured by individual level statistics _meta_end_dot_
