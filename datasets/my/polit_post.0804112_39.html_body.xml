  josh patashnik did a smart article on how virginia may not be as favorable to obama as the press seems to think _meta_end_dot_

 but then there s the matter of the virginia polling which shows a big lead for obama _meta_end_dot_

 it s not been a heavily polled state so i m not sure how much confidence you should have in the accuracy of those surveys but they certainly seem to show that virginians other than my aunt lisa like obama _meta_end_dot_
