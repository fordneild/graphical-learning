  fred barnes knows just how to revive john mccain s listless presidential campaign gay bashing his way to victory by more strongly emphasizing his desire to frustrate the goals of gay and lesbian americans who want to serve their country in uniform or get married to people they love _meta_end_dot_

 there s perhaps no better time to recall that mccain guru lobbyist charlie black used to be a jesse helms guy and liked his race baiting campaign tactics _meta_end_dot_

 as ed kilgore observed reviewing a book on helms helms was undoubtedly the living connection between the racial politics of the old south and the religion based cultural politics of the new right _meta_end_dot_

 he was the one surviving segregationist of stature who never regretted or retracted his opposition to the major civil rights legislation of the _meta_number_ref_s _meta_end_dot_

 his career long opposition to any national gesture commemorating the civil rights movement most notably his interminable and often scurrilous rearguard efforts to taint the memory of martin luther king jr made his strident rhetoric against voting rights enforcement and anything approaching affirmative action an afterthought _meta_end_dot_

 and helms s two reelection campaigns in _meta_number_ref_ and _meta_number_ref_ against african american democrat harvey gantt pivoted on explicit race baiting as helms s congressional club allies later admitted to link _meta_end_dot_

 helms practically invented the modern conservative politics of sexuality along with the electoral mobilization of white conservative evangelicals starting back in the _meta_number_ref_s _meta_end_dot_

 in _meta_number_ref_ he seized on anita bryant s successful campaign to overturn a gay rights ordinance in miami and began building a national backlash against antidiscrimination laws _meta_end_dot_

 as early as _meta_number_ref_ he was making speeches about the terrible threat of secular humanism to christianity making the wonky aspen institute of humanistic studies an unlikely villain _meta_end_dot_

 when the aids epidemic emerged in the _meta_number_ref_s helms began an extended and violently worded campaign to protect americans from the perverts whose disgusting habits were responsible for aids while attacking efforts to find effective treatments _meta_end_dot_

 most memorably helms single handedly made the national endowment of the arts subsidies for obscene and homosexual artwork a culture war staple for nearly two decades _meta_end_dot_

 and there we go _meta_end_dot_

 fortunately public support for gay and lesbian equality continues to strengthen over time so these kind of tactics should have a limited shelf life _meta_end_dot_
