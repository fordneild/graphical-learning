  griff witte and ellen knickmeyer report that the shortage in u s funded supplies threatens the palestinian government s ability to provide security in the west bank which israel has made a condition of future withdrawals from the occupied territories and why is there a shortage in u s funded supplies _meta_end_question_

 well in addition to making competent palestinian security forces a condition for withdrawal from the west bank israel has traditionally viewed palestinian security forces as potential adversaries and therefore israel failed to approve delivery of the requested supplies in time for the deployment according to senior palestinian officials obviously obviously complex situation much blame to go around etc but this kind of thing things which most americans are very ill informed about is why arabs tend to doubt israel s protestations that they re eager for a fair and peaceful resolution of the conflict _meta_end_dot_
