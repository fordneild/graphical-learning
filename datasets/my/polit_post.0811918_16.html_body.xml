  ambinder says given that undecided superdelegates have said that their primary criterion for determining who they ll choose is who has the best chance of beating john mccain in the fall there s no real reason for those superdelegates to choose in june _meta_end_dot_

 they ll have more information about electability in july or august _meta_end_dot_

 so why choose in an environment with less info well i d say the reason is that we re not really gaining more information as time goes on clinton backers for example were making the wright ayers anti obama argument to pundits and no doubt superdelegates as well quietly for months before it hit the mainstream _meta_end_dot_

 what s happening instead is that both candidates negatives are going up while resources aren t being applied against john mccain _meta_end_dot_

 insofar as superdelagates genuinely want to pick a winner they ll recognize that picking someone gives them a better chance of winning than does a summer of indecision _meta_end_dot_
