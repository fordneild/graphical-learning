  it s possible that i know even less about the details of fisa legislation than joe klein does so unlike him i ve decided to let that issue primarily be covered by people who know what they re talking about _meta_end_dot_

 that said it s clear to me from reading this post that his views on this subject aren t being driven by anything related to fisa at all _meta_end_dot_

 rather his point is finally if we can t rebuild the non toxic atmosphere of bipartisan cooperation that served the country through most of its history few if any of the reforms most democrats favor will have any chance of passage even with a democratic president and congress _meta_end_dot_

 we simply need to get past the cynicism and partisan mistrust cultivated by the bush administration _meta_end_dot_

 this however conflates two slightly separate issues _meta_end_dot_

 one is the cynicism of the bush administration _meta_end_dot_

 the constant lying and disregard for the law _meta_end_dot_

 we really do need to get past all that but obviously such getting past can t be accomplish by the opposition party s bold acts of will _meta_end_dot_

 at a minimum you would actually need to get rid of the cynical bush administration personnel and have them replaced by other people _meta_end_dot_

 more broadly though it s unfair to bush to blame him for the lack of the sort of bipartisan cooperation we saw in the past and it s equally unfair to blame democrats for not reviving it _meta_end_dot_

 bipartisan competition will tend to be rarer when the parties are ideologically coherent _meta_end_dot_

 and that s what we have right now almost every democrat in congress is more liberal than almost every republican _meta_end_dot_

 that makes bipartisan cooperation difficult _meta_end_dot_

 the roots of this polarization however are structural and not really lamentable _meta_end_dot_

 the old era of bipartisan cooperation was grounded in the parties having substantial ideological overlap and that in turn was a consequence of jim crow and the existence of a weird one party state in the apartheid south where the one party was the democrats even though the region was generally more conservative in ideological terms _meta_end_dot_

 that era s not going to come back and we shouldn t want it to come back even if we deem certain aspects of its passing to be lamentable _meta_end_dot_

 but most of all we shouldn t urge the congress to take courses of action that are wrong on the merits out of a deluded sense that doing so might revive a past era of bipartisanship _meta_end_dot_

 the causes of these things are structural _meta_end_dot_

 and the structural set up of a situation in which a bipartisan fisa compromise could be reached are pretty clear _meta_end_dot_

 you d need a democratic president _meta_end_dot_

 no democratic president is going to be dogmatic about refusing to accept vast new executive powers _meta_end_dot_

 at the same time given the nature of the political coalitions a democrat wouldn t be seeking to block compromise and thereby gain a wedge issue _meta_end_dot_

 congressional republicans will see their authoritarianism tempered by partisanship _meta_end_dot_

 but those circumstances don t exist so a bipartisan solution looks unlikely _meta_end_dot_

 but acts of unilateral surrender don t end political polarization _meta_number_ref_ democrats voted for bush s tax cuts in _meta_number_ref_ several democrats voted for the _meta_number_ref_ medicare bill a whole bumper crop of democrats voted for the war in _meta_number_ref_ etc _meta_end_dot_

 but the structural roots of partisan polarization remained in place _meta_end_dot_
