  not only is hillary clinton apparently weighing making a loan to her own campaign to try to keep pace with barack obama s big fundraising haul but it seems she s already loaned herself _meta_dollor_ref_ million _meta_end_dot_

 howard wolfson says late last month senator clinton loaned her campaign _meta_dollor_ref_ million the loan illustrates sen _meta_end_dot_

 clinton s commitment to this effort and to ensuring that our campaign has the resources it needs to compete and win across this nation _meta_end_dot_

 we have had one of our best fundraising efforts ever on the web today and our super tuesday victories will only help in bringing more support for her candidacy _meta_end_dot_

 now it seems to me that logically one problem with self financing ought to be that it hurts fundraising _meta_end_dot_

 the reminder that the clintons are multi millionaires would seem to me to make giving them a modest cash donation of _meta_dollor_ref_ or _meta_dollor_ref_ seem like a less attractive proposition _meta_end_dot_

 does it turn you into an obama donor _meta_end_question_

 of course not _meta_end_dot_

 but maybe you donate that money to the poor or to a favorite congressional candidate or you buy yourself something nice _meta_end_dot_

 after all why would you donate money to someone much richer than yourself _meta_end_question_

 of course if clinton wins you give her money to pay back her loan because you re looking for favors from the white house _meta_end_dot_

 but from where we re sitting now but for now what s the point _meta_end_question_

 of course regular people may not look at it that way _meta_end_dot_

 i ve had more than one person including people who aren t necessarily clinton supporters but who aren t clinton haters either tell me they will feel sorry for clinton if she loses _meta_end_dot_

 from where i sit a multimillionaire us senator has an okay life whether or not she gets elected president _meta_end_dot_

 but obviously a lot of rank and file democrats feel a deep personally connection to the clinton family in a way that transcends the banal reality that the clintons are much much better off than the average american _meta_end_dot_

 not of course that the obamas are the wretched of the earth at this point but they re not as loaded as the clintons
