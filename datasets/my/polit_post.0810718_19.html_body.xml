  paul krugman asked a question near and dear to this native born new yorker s heart i understand why it s political poison to show disrespect for small town values dignity is precious to all of us and often trumps material interest _meta_end_dot_

 but why is it ok to disrespect big city values even to suggest as bush has that big city dwellers aren t part of the real america _meta_end_question_

 i think the answer is that it isn t okay _meta_end_dot_

 not only was i born in new york city but both of my parents were and three of my four grandparents were _meta_end_dot_

 the great grandparents all came from foreign countries _meta_end_dot_

 that s a very american story an american tail if you will yet the conservative movement in america treats it as some kind of elitist put on that my dad has the temerity to live in the city where he was born i think you can see in the election results that gop rhetoric of this sort has the expected effect _meta_end_dot_

 look at the _meta_number_ref_ election results and you ll see bush s dad winning california and dominating in the new york suburbs carrying new jersey connecticut and westchester nassau and suffolk counties in new york _meta_end_dot_

 some of that s issues but some of it is surely metropolitan america not liking gop atmospherics and condescension _meta_end_dot_

 but the press covers this stuff in different ways _meta_end_dot_

 obama made a gaffe whereas bush has a masterful political strategy to exploit democrats out of touchiness _meta_end_dot_

 that s because republicans have dominated recent american politics so the press is primed to find democratic blunders and gop masterstrokes _meta_end_dot_

 if we wake up in january _meta_number_ref_ and the government is dominated by a democrat named barack obama and a congressional leadership from san francisco pelosi las vegas reid chicago emmannuel and durbin suburban maryland hoyer and brooklyn schumer i assume we ll start hearing more about potential downsides to gop political tactics _meta_end_dot_

 but they would need to lose first _meta_end_dot_
