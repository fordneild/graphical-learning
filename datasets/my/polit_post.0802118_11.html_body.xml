  i continue to march in lockstep with my comrades of convenience national review against the attempted coronation of john mccain _meta_end_dot_

 for example did you know what michael graham notes in _meta_number_ref_ running against george w _meta_end_dot_

 bush and the entire carroll campbell machine in south carolina john mccain got _meta_percent_ref_ of the vote and _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ votes out of _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ or so cast _meta_end_dot_

 tonight he got _meta_percent_ref_ of the vote in a field where his top challengers romney and giuliani aren t even running and _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ actual votes _meta_end_dot_

 if just the same people who voted for mccain in _meta_number_ref_ had voted for him today he would have won _meta_number_ref__meta_beep_ref_ of the south carolina vote _meta_end_dot_

 that would have been truly impressive _meta_end_dot_

 go mitt go _meta_end_exclamation_

 i d also note that the open cheerleading for romney in progressive circles seems to me to have gotten shockingly little play in the world of conservative commentary update let me note that while i do think romney is a weak general election candidate one shouldn t exaggerate this to much _meta_end_dot_

 in the modern era i think we can expect all presidential elections to be relatively close and romney does have a certain i know what i m doing appeal that i think the american people mostly haven t seen yet _meta_end_dot_
