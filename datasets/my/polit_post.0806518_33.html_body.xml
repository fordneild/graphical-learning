  jeff van gundy explains in a cool feature for the play website _meta_end_dot_

 given that defense is half of basketball there s shockingly little discussion of it in the sports media _meta_end_dot_

 everyone knows that boston has put together a great defense this year but you don t hear much about what makes it so great except for vague allusions to kevin garnett s intensity i m sure he s intense but there s more to it than that _meta_end_dot_
