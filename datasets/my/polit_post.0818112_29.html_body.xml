  i agree with noam scheiber that the republicans probably should evolve in a sam s club direction and also that they probably can t evolve in a sam s club direction _meta_end_dot_

 but this seems way overstated having said all that these guys are right the gop is absolutely screwed _meta_end_dot_

 even though the money comes from the same place it has for decades the votes increasingly come from socially conservative working class people _meta_end_dot_

 at some point something s got to give _meta_end_dot_

 i just think it s going to be the gop which will basically cease to exist rather than the moneymen and powerbrokers _meta_end_dot_

 in the real world it seems to me that in terms of the white house and governor s mansions there s just a natural dynamic that leads the parties to more or less alternate in power since bad macroeconomic conditions are very bad for incumbents and yet not something that can be uniformly avoided _meta_end_dot_

 beyond that from _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ the gop was almost uniformly shut out of power in congress and rarely held the presidency but even then it didn t basically cease to exist on top of all that i don t think this is going to happen but you can easily imagine a scenario in which barack obama takes power in _meta_number_ref_ the country faces some kind of foreign policy fiasco followed by a terrorist attack at home and the gop comes roaring back in _meta_number_ref_ and _meta_number_ref_ without changing its ideological stripes much at all _meta_end_dot_
