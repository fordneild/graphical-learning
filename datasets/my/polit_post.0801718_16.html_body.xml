  adam blinick upset at john edwards anti nuclear stance asserts that nuclear power is the only environmentally friendly economic and efficient source of energy that can help the u s _meta_end_dot_

 wean itself off foreign oil we ll be weaned off the dastardly power perhaps with nuclear powered cars _meta_end_question_

 i have no problem with the idea that putting a proper price on carbon might lead to good things for the nuclear power industry but the issue in practice is that nuclear advocates are busy demanding large subsidies _meta_end_dot_

 it makes sense to some extent to subsidize clean sources of electricity but we should target subsidies on really truly clean sources of power and nuclear s not that _meta_end_dot_

 the idea that dastardly anti nuclear activists are the main thing standing between us and a halt to global warming is i guess a neat contrarian conceit but it really doesn t stand up to much scrutiny _meta_end_dot_
