  can t say it s much of a surprise that despite all the friedman units and talk of victory and how iraq won t really play in the _meta_number_ref_ campaign that four years after the _meta_number_ref_ campaign there ll be the _meta_number_ref_ campaign _meta_end_dot_

 and four years after that comes the _meta_number_ref_ campaign _meta_end_dot_

 and two years after that comes _meta_number_ref_ when iraqi officials say it might be possible for american troops to leave _meta_end_dot_

 my then you ll have _meta_number_ref_ year olds serving in iraq who were five when the war started _meta_end_dot_

 but a couple of key phrases from the new york times s account those comments from the minister abdul qadir were among the most specific public projections of a timeline for the american commitment in iraq by officials in either washington or baghdad _meta_end_dot_

 and they suggested a longer commitment than either government had previously indicated _meta_end_dot_

 pentagon officials expressed no surprise at mr _meta_end_dot_

 qadir s projections which were even less optimistic than those he made last year _meta_end_dot_

 one if the surge is working so well why is it that mr _meta_end_dot_

 qadir s projections are getting less optimistic _meta_end_question_

 answer maybe the surge isn t working so well and maybe this upright citizens brigade strategy doesn t contain the seeds of any kind of stable equilibrium for iraq _meta_end_dot_

 two why is it that officials expressed no surprise at projections that suggested a longer commitment than either government had previously indicated _meta_end_question_

 answer both governments have not been indicating things accurately _meta_end_dot_

 they ve been misleading _meta_end_dot_

 this is in my view the key to breaking the political deadlock over iraq in the united states _meta_end_dot_

 a large number of people agree with my preference for an expeditious withdrawal from iraq _meta_end_dot_

 unfortunately though it s not a majority of people _meta_end_dot_

 but the number of people who favor the sort of decade plus engagement that constitutes the actual alternative to expeditious withdrawal is incredibly small _meta_end_dot_

 what s needed however are political leaders who are willing and able to re enforce the point that s been revealed again and again by american reporters the alternative to leaving is staying for a very very very long time _meta_end_dot_

 u s _meta_end_dot_
