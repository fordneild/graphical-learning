  nyt polls the gas tax issue _meta_end_dot_

 how remarkable _meta_end_dot_

 it s almost as if the press unusual decision to make some effort to cover the issue in a substantive way led to a better informed electorate _meta_end_dot_

 weird wild stuff _meta_end_dot_

 it s strange to me how media types can simultaneously keep in their heads the idea that voters are very concerned about things like high gas prices and the rising costs of health care but wouldn t be interested in political news that focused on which candidates have good ideas for addressing those problems _meta_end_dot_

 oh well hopefully we can get back to all freakshow all the time soon _meta_end_dot_
