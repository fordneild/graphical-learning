  it s noteworthy how the mccain lieberman alliance is portrayed in the press as a kind of centrist independent fusion movement when the main thing that brings them together is their shared ardor for an unpopular war in iraq _meta_end_dot_

 they both clearly see their views on iraq and related matters as their most important priorities in public life and the views they share on this subject are well to the right of the median americans _meta_end_dot_

 and yet they re in the center _meta_end_dot_

 one assumes that a dennis kucinich ron paul lovefest on national security issues would by contrast be talking about as an example of extreme views being similar to one another _meta_end_dot_

 the dynamic here clearly has less to do with public opinion than it does with establishmentarian ideas about what is and is not extreme _meta_end_dot_

 washington dc or even more so the suburbs in virginia where the power brokers live is a kind of place where heavy military equipment is advertised on the subway and defense contractors are a major engine of employment and economic growth _meta_end_dot_

 which isn t to say that there s a direct connect the dots relationship between the c_meta_number_ref_ j spartan ad campaign and media portrayals of the lieberman mccain worldview but i think it s important to understand that a kind of casual militarism permeates the atmosphere and anything that serves the cause of ever growing procurement acquires a veneer of respectability _meta_end_dot_
