  kevin carey on the trouble with good colleges only being good because they select the best students _meta_end_dot_

 as he says there are a lot of good reasons to want to go to a selective college from the standpoint of rational self interest they have nothing whatsoever to do with the quality of education those colleges provide this in turn is a significant policy problem _meta_end_dot_

 we should want our higher education system as a whole to be adding value and not just sorting people _meta_end_dot_

 after all we could find much cheaper ways of sorting people than providing them with a four year college education _meta_end_dot_
