  via spencer ackerman it seems the term concerned local citizens has been deemed insufficiently euphemism y and now paul mcleary reports but now no one is mentioning the clcs _meta_end_dot_

 with the amazing speed of an acronym happy military i ve found out that the new hot off the presses iraqi approved term is sons of iraq soi for short _meta_end_dot_

 seems that concerned local citizen didn t translate into arabic so well and the iraqis didn t like it _meta_end_dot_

 so now when you mention armed groups of civilians manning checkpoints and doing the work that the iraqi police and army either will not or can not do be sure to call them the sons of iraq and there you have it _meta_end_dot_

 personally i m glad for the change since concerned local citizens always made me think of the upright citizens brigade _meta_end_dot_
