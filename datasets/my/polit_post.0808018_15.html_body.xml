  one of the more absurd parts of america s broken telecom policies is that we ve been achieving an internationally respectable level of broadband penetration in part by defining broadband down such that _meta_number_ref_kbps which is far too slow qualifies _meta_end_dot_

 in a bit of good news though the fcc has decided to boost the figure to the not nearly as inadequate _meta_number_ref_kbps _meta_end_dot_

 this still leaves us wondering why consumers in japan and south korea can get _meta_number_ref_ mbps service for less than what we pay for much lower speeds _meta_end_dot_
