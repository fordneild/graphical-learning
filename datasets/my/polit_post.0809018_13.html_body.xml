  dave berri notes that despite the sense you frequently get of the nba declining in popularity attendance is actually way up in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ the average nba team attracted _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ fans during the regular season _meta_end_dot_

 and this was the all time record _meta_end_dot_

 let me repeat _meta_end_dot_

 last season the nba which shanoff says is declining in popularity set an all time attendance record _meta_end_dot_

 and this is a per team average record of course they also set a record for total attendance _meta_end_dot_

 to put this mark in perspective _meta_number_ref_ years ago during the peak of the boston la rivalry the nba s per team average was only _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ fans _meta_end_dot_

 across the past _meta_number_ref_ years while the u s _meta_end_dot_

 population has grown _meta_number_ref_ _meta_percent_ref_ nba attendance has grown _meta_number_ref_ _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 so more teams and higher average attendance that seems pretty good _meta_end_dot_

 what s probably going on is that thanks to the proliferation of media everything has more of a niche vibe than it used to _meta_end_dot_

 back before most people had cable anytime anything was on television at all it was somewhere between _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ and _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_th depending on where you lived of the total things available to watch on tv and there were no dvds or websites or ondemand offerings to provide further options _meta_end_dot_

 so anything that got above a certain it s on television threshold automatically acquired a certain air of mass relevance that these days is very hard for anything to achieve _meta_end_dot_
