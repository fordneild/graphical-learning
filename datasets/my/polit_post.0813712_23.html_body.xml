  i m pretty sure that re vetting his entire staff to try to ensure that there are no more embarrassing incidents like slorc lobbyists popping up in key campaign positions isn t how john mccain intended to kick off his presidential campaign _meta_end_dot_

 this hubub over lobbyists for the unsavory does however tend to highlight exactly how radical and absurd mccain anti diplomacy views are _meta_end_dot_

 to him and his campaign and many of his supporters the idea of so much as having state to state negotiations with a rogue state like iran or syria is repugnant and absurd _meta_end_dot_

 and yet all kinds of other business gets done with all kinds of other nasty regimes _meta_end_dot_

 i ll confess that i own products manufactured in whole or in part in the people s republic of china _meta_end_dot_

 and guess what _meta_end_question_

 so do you _meta_end_dot_

 and all kinds of american firms are doing business in china _meta_end_dot_

 the queen of jordan is the toast of washington whenever she comes to down nyu is opening a campus in abu dhabi slorc has lobbyists in the united states _meta_end_dot_

 this is the world we live in _meta_end_dot_

 all of these regimes do some pretty awful stuff _meta_end_dot_

 and yet doing as mccain has and promising to reconfigure international relations around the idea that we only have real diplomatic relations with countries whose internal policies we approve of is impractical and absurd _meta_end_dot_

 and of course mccain himself doesn t intend to apply it with any kind of logic or consistency _meta_end_dot_

 he s not saying that having a meeting with chinese officials constitutes appeasement or that we should invade saudi arabia to turn it into a democracy _meta_end_dot_

 but he is saying we should create a league of extraordinary democracies to kick ass globally without the chinese say so and then it s just fantastical to think there won t be a response to that _meta_end_dot_

 any kind of serious policy needs to be made in the actual world of diplomacy and business where we don t get to just pretend that these countries don t exist or don t have interests _meta_end_dot_
