  i see that the amazon page for heads in the sand is telling me that people who buy my book might also enjoy rick perlstein s nixonland _meta_end_dot_

 indeed you can buy both simultaneously for just _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 as it happens i just got to read the first _meta_number_ref_ pages or so of nixonland yesterday before relinquishing spencer s copy back to him and it s eye opening _meta_end_dot_

 while rick s been slumming it up as a blogger and pamphleteer i d sort of forgotten what an engaging evocative narrative writer he is _meta_end_dot_

 somewhat confusingly the book s not about nixon it s about the nixon era of american politics starting in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 but buy the book _meta_end_dot_

 and buy my book too _meta_end_dot_

 buy them together _meta_end_dot_
