  ryan lizza has an excellent article sketching out the lines of debate over the future of the republican party and where john mccain fits into the whole thing apparently he sees himself as leading a struggle against resurgent forces of isolationism _meta_end_dot_

 ross douthat s not too happy but um senator mccain you did notice that ron paul topped out at about _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ percent of the vote didn t you _meta_end_question_

 and that every other candidate in the race allowing for certain variations took roughly the same foreign policy line as you _meta_end_question_

 doesn t that at the very least suggest that there might be more pressing battles awaiting a politician looking to reinvent the republican party than a crusade against the isolationist menace _meta_end_question_

 please _meta_end_question_

 ross seems a bit confused _meta_end_dot_

 as anyone familiar with george w _meta_end_dot_

 bush s _meta_number_ref_ state of the union address knows isolationist means anyone who doesn t favor repeating the enormous blunders of the past six years in that sense the forces of isolationism really are growing and one could even have imagined a president romney or a president huckabee turning out to be a closet isolationist once in office _meta_end_dot_

 but john mccain wanted a pointless and counterproductive policy of rogue state rollback before it was cool _meta_end_dot_
