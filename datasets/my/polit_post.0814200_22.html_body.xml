  well as predicted obama won oregon canceling out clinton s win in the similarly sized kentucky _meta_end_dot_

 meanwhile i found this part of the kentucky exit polls interesting _meta_end_dot_

 obviously given the extent of her win this didn t alter the outcome but it seems that a pretty hefty chunk of clinton primary voters in that state don t plan on voting for her in november they just really really really don t like barack obama _meta_end_dot_
