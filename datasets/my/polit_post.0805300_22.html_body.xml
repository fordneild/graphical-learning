  i thought this was a mostly dull debate and under the circumstances that s good for obama _meta_end_dot_

 overall though this is a good format for hillary clinton and she as usual did well on the health care debate whereas i thought he was more impressive on the diplomatic and foreign policy issues _meta_end_dot_

 everyone seems to agree that her effort to press the bogus plagiarism issue didn t work out well _meta_end_dot_

 bottom line if she was still the front runner this would have counted as a clear clinton win obama had some good moments but her ability to rattle off policy details on the fly really comes through whereas obama needs to pause to think _meta_end_dot_

 but she s not the front runner anymore and it s hard to see anything she did to make up lost ground _meta_end_dot_
