  mccain promises to veto every beer which can t go over well with the white working class _meta_end_dot_

 he also promises to veto every bill with earmarks in it _meta_end_dot_

 this is certainly something he likes to talk about but it seems like a potential disaster to me _meta_end_dot_

 isn t the crack obama organization going to be able to send out customized mailers to everyone in america featuring a list of locally popular projects that mccain s promised to get rid of _meta_end_question_

 seems like something a good database and a dozen interns could pull off _meta_end_dot_
