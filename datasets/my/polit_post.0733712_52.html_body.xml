  frank foer offers his take on the scott beauchamp mess _meta_end_dot_

 this whole doesn t seem to me to reflect very well on beauchamp on tnr or on the crazed hawks who went after this story with guns blazing _meta_end_dot_

 whatever the magazine s sins here may have been though one could hardly deem them especially significant in the broader scheme of things _meta_end_dot_

 more to the point the magazine s response to allegations that it had printed something false is emblematic of how serious journalists respond to such matters seriously with a real effort to the discern the truth and with the belief that it s a seriously bad thing to publish something that wasn t true _meta_end_dot_

 this is a sense of conscience and responsibility that seems almost entirely absent from the journals of the conservative movement _meta_end_dot_

 one could point to the way w _meta_end_dot_

 thomas smith appears to have written a bunch of made up stuff about lebanon for national review online but to be fair to smith i can easily imagine a person coming to the conclusion that nro doesn t see inaccuracy as a bar to publication _meta_end_dot_

 brad delong reminded us recently that national review regularly publishes donald luskin included such pearls of wisdom as the following critique of studies showing rising inequality in the united states but none of this is reliable anyway a footnote reveals that the statistics are derived from the panel study of income dynamics database an ongoing survey that tracks only _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ families out of a u s _meta_end_dot_

 population of _meta_number_ref_ million individuals _meta_end_dot_

 yes that s right donald luskin contributing editor to nro financial doesn t believe in the validity of statistical sampling _meta_end_dot_

 but of course since we re talking about a publication that frequently publishes intelligent designers on scientific topics why shouldn t it publish people who don t believe in statistics on economic tactics _meta_end_question_

 and following on that why not let smith fabricate his dispatches from lebanon _meta_end_question_

 after all climate change denialism gets a fair hearing at national review on a regular basis _meta_end_dot_

 some people will probably find k lo s apology about how nro should have provided readers with more context and caveats in some posts from lebanon this fall to be a laughably inadequate response to having completely fabricated an invasion of east beirut by thousands of hezbollah fighters _meta_end_dot_

 to me though it seems like rank hypocrisy for nro to hold a particular writer out to dry like this smith was just working to the long established nro standards _meta_end_dot_
