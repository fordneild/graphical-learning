  going to play professionally in europe for a year or two certainly strikes me as a superior option for a talented _meta_number_ref_ year old american basketball player than going to play for a fake amateur team affiliated with an american college or university _meta_end_dot_

 indeed it seems like something of a no brainer _meta_end_dot_

 and maybe if more people did it the ncaa would start feeling pressure to erode the cartel s rules against compensating athletes for the work they do on behalf of the college _meta_end_dot_

 or who knows maybe some colleges might even decide that managing for profit sports franchises is an odd side business for institutions of higher education to be running _meta_end_dot_
