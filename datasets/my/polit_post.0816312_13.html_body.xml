  this is stunning stuff _meta_end_dot_

 having convinced a swathe of the press that it was unfair of democrats to accurately quote mccain as saying he had no problem with american troops being in iraq for _meta_number_ref_ years he s now back saying it s not too important whether or not our troops ever leave iraq not to put too fine a point on it but it seems important to iraqis the americans are making demands that would lead to the colonization of iraq said sami al askari a senior shiite politician on parliament s foreign relations committee who is close to prime minister nouri al maliki _meta_end_dot_

 if we can t reach a fair agreement many people think we should say goodbye u s _meta_end_dot_

 troops _meta_end_dot_

 we don t need you here anymore and those are the friendly ones opposition iraqi politicians have even stronger feelings _meta_end_dot_

 given iraqi sentiment about this topic mccain s vision of a long time but utterly peaceful presence since extremely difficult to realize _meta_end_dot_

 it s just really really really hard to station your troops where they re not wanted _meta_end_dot_

 meanwhile amidst his analogies to south korea and germany mccain seems to be missing the part where he explains why making permanent bases our key war aim is a good idea _meta_end_dot_

 we maintained our garrison in west germany because of the warsaw pact across the border and you can t understand why our troops are in south korea without thinking about north korea _meta_end_dot_

 but what are they going to be doing in iraq _meta_end_question_

 fighting iran _meta_end_question_

 that seems like a recipe for ensuring that iraq never becomes peaceful and stable since if our goal in iraq is to create a platform for anti iranian activities then the iranians would seem to have no choice but to stir up as much trouble as possible _meta_end_dot_
