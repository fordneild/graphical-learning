  kevin drum and phil carter discuss length of combat tours and counterinsurgency and conclude that there s no answer _meta_end_dot_

 as kevin says short tours don t give you enough time to learn the ground and the people but long tours eat up the troops _meta_end_dot_

 there s no good middle ground carter s suggestion to try to make sure to re deploy people back to the same place they d deployed to previously does seem like one step in the direction of a middle ground _meta_end_dot_

 another necessary step would i think be to make sure that we re very leery as a matter of national strategy from getting involved in these kind of situations rather than deluded ourselves into thinking that some doctrinal improvements suddenly make the impossible possible _meta_end_dot_

 last simply a sense of scale there s a whole lot of different kinds of things that can fall under the counterinsurgency or stability operations heading many of which are much less giant manpower intensive and infeasible than what s happening in iraq _meta_end_dot_

 i hear different things for example about the merits of our ongoing counterinsurgency assistance to colombia but it s certainly not creating some unbearable strain on our military _meta_end_dot_

 simply avoiding situations that require hundreds of thousands of american soldiers for a years long mission seems like the most important piece of the puzzle _meta_end_dot_
