  it s worth pointing out that john mccain s embrace of discredited autism vaccine connection theories isn t just an odd display of ignorance it s a positive public danger _meta_end_dot_

 there are millions and millions of people in this country strongly predisposed to believe that john mccain wouldn t run around saying there was strong evidence that getting your kids vaccinated might put them at risk for autism unless there was in fact such evidence _meta_end_dot_

 some of them will have their children avoid vaccination and a price will be paid _meta_end_dot_
