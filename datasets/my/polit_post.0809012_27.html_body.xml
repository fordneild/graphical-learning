  it s a bit hard to focus on the war in iraq while at a wedding but as kevin drum wonders what happens if the mahdi army beats the government forces and wins the battle of basra i have to wonder about the reverse _meta_end_dot_

 maliki s hopes of a swift victory are obviously through but what if iraqi government forces given enough time and anglo american support manage to first crush organized armed resistance in sadr city and then swing south and take control of basra _meta_end_question_

 do sadrists wind up winning local elections this fall anyway _meta_end_question_

 or does isci use its newfound military supremacy to intimidate people away from the sadrists _meta_end_question_

 suppose maliki winds up with a quasi democratic mandate for a not very popular regime that we re now committed to supporting _meta_end_dot_

 imagine the best case scenario here where over the next two or three years us military logistical and financial support lets maliki build an efficacious pro american regime that s a bit lacking in the old popular legitimacy but that certainly manages to hold onto power _meta_end_dot_

 we ve got a mesopotamian egypt or saudi arabia or kuwait qatar bahrain etc _meta_end_dot_

 maybe that s outrageously optimistic _meta_end_dot_

 and guess what it s our support for regimes like that s the main driver of al qaeda terrorism _meta_end_dot_

 and for that matter what does happen if the mahdi army beats the government forces and wins the battle of basra _meta_end_question_

 there don t seem to me to be any scenarios in either direction where expending huge amounts of further american blood and treasure looks like a good option _meta_end_dot_
