  obviously readers are aware that i don t watch much college basketball and therefore my scouting opinions are worthless _meta_end_dot_

 but thought derrick rose looks like a fine basketball player talk of picking him ahead of michael beasley seems kind of crazy to me beasley scores way more _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ versus _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ on better shooting from the field _meta_number_ref_ versus _meta_number_ref_ from the line _meta_number_ref_ versus _meta_number_ref_ and from beyond the arc _meta_number_ref_ versus _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 beasley s a forward who snags _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ rebounds per game to rose s _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ while rose is a guard who gets _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ assists per game to beasley s _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ while their turnovers are similar _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ for beasley to _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ for rose _meta_end_dot_

 chad ford s rationale for the pick doesn t make me feel much better about rose everyone likes scorers and rebounders which is why beasley is so appealing _meta_end_dot_

 statistically as john hollinger shows he s one of the best college prospects ever _meta_end_dot_

 however paxson is in desperate need of a leader who s willing to sacrifice for the team a guy whose value doesn t always show up in the box score just the win column _meta_end_dot_

 he had to be grinning from ear to ear when rose said i m an unselfish guard that s willing to do anything to win _meta_end_dot_

 i mean anything those intangibles aren t nothing but the bulls look to me an awful lot like a team that needs someone who can hit shots reliably and good rebounders are always welcome _meta_end_dot_

 apparently rose played much better at the end of the season and if you throw out the first half of his season then the numbers look better for him though beasley is still better _meta_end_dot_
