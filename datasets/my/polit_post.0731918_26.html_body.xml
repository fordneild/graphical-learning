  larry bartels emails ezra klein some data about his research on the impact in terms of statistical correlation of perceptions of different candidate attributes on voting behavior the analysis was based on survey questions asking voters to rate presidential candidates on a variety of dimensions _meta_end_dot_

 here are the estimated effects of those evaluations on voting behavior averaged over elections from _meta_number_ref_ to _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 the numbers are not directly interpretable but the relative magnitudes are i turned the numbers into a handy chart showing the average on the left and the _meta_number_ref_ result on the right i m not really sure what to make of this though as i sort of feel like people may tailor the characteristics they say they re looking for to suit the candidate they re going to vote for _meta_end_dot_

 mainly you want to be strong yet caring _meta_end_dot_

 or caring yet strong _meta_end_dot_
