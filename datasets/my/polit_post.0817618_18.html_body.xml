  it seems john mccain is prepared to admit that his drilling schemes won t actually bring down gas prices but still defends the plan by saying even though it may take some years the fact that we are exploiting those reserves would have psychological impact that i think is beneficial um okay _meta_end_dot_

 but if even conservatives agree that aesthetics are a valid reason against drilling why doesn t that override the psychic benefits of drilling _meta_end_question_

 more to the point couldn t people use some policies that are beneficial in non psychological ways _meta_end_dot_

 maybe the federal government should provide a cash infusion to mass transit systems so that instead of buckling under increased demand we can improve the quality of people s experience and start running trains and buses more quickly _meta_end_question_

 that wouldn t solve everyone s problems by any means but it would deliver genuine help to many people in the short run _meta_end_dot_
