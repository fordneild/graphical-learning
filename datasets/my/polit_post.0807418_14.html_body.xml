  the pew center has a new survey out offering definitive evidence that the surge has in fact been a success in terms of its main goal of boosting the odds of an indefinite american military commitment to iraq _meta_end_dot_

 here we see on the left for example that coverage of the war in iraq has plummeted in recent months _meta_end_dot_

 stories like this one about how the body of a chaldean catholic archbishop who was kidnapped in the northern city of mosul last month as he drove home after afternoon mass was discovered thursday buried in a southeastern area of the city aren t getting the kind of play they used to _meta_end_dot_

 after all the war s over and there s nothing to write about or put on television _meta_end_dot_

 similarly an item like iraq car bomb kills _meta_number_ref_ in baghdad could be bad for home front morale but thanks to the surge and to general petraeus surge of savvy press management people don t hear as much about that kind of thing as they used to _meta_end_dot_

 similarly depressing downer stories like _meta_number_ref_ fort hood soldiers killed in iraq bombing aren t as big a deal in the media as they once were _meta_end_dot_

 and that s important because for all the talk of the surge working according to its proponents it s going to need to keep on working for something like ten years _meta_end_dot_

 over time that can add up to an awful lot of body bags so you don t want people to hear about that kind of thing _meta_end_dot_

 aren t aware of how many soldeirs have died in iraq _meta_end_dot_

 isolated findings of public ignorance of some or another subject usually aren t as meaningful as they first seem but pew is showing a clear trend here _meta_end_dot_

 the public used to have a good handle on how many troops had died in iraq but ever since the surge started working people s understanding of the issue went into decline even as the body count kept creeping higher in august _meta_number_ref_ _meta_percent_ref_ correctly identified the fatality level at that time about _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ deaths _meta_end_dot_

 in previous polls going back to the spring of _meta_number_ref_ about half of respondents could correctly estimate the number of u s _meta_end_dot_

 fatalities around the time of the survey _meta_end_dot_

 in the current poll more respondents underestimated than overestimated the number of fatalities _meta_end_dot_

 a plurality of _meta_percent_ref_ said that there have been about _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ troop deaths and another _meta_percent_ref_ said there have been _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ deaths _meta_end_dot_

 just under a quarter _meta_percent_ref_ said the number of fatalities is closer to _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 in fact these days the correct answer is around _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ but the surge has succeeded in making sure that relatively few people are aware of that fact _meta_end_dot_

 controlling the information landscape is key because the public continues to have mixed feelings about the underlying issue _meta_end_dot_

 people think the war was a mistake and think it hasn t been worth the costs _meta_end_dot_

 but rather than quit right now the median voter seems to want to let things play out for a little while longer _meta_end_dot_

 the challenge for people who want to end the war is to make people see that that s not a viable option that the real policy choices are between leaving in as quickly a way as is safe and practical or else staying for many years _meta_end_dot_

 the challenge for those who want to see the war continue indefinitely is to obscure the length of commitment they re talking about and to obscure the ongoing costs of an open ended u s _meta_end_dot_

 military presence in iraq _meta_end_dot_

 judged by those standards the surge is working pretty well _meta_end_dot_
