  i think it s a dodge to answer the question about why u s _meta_end_dot_

 broadband is so much worse than japanese or south korean broadband by referring to america s lower population density _meta_end_dot_

 if the issue were that we have excellent internet service in some places but it s super slow in wyoming then sure you d say it s the density _meta_end_dot_

 but the population density of southern california or say new jersey is pretty high and you don t get asian style broadband there either _meta_end_dot_

 for that matter you don t get asian style broadband in manhattan _meta_end_dot_

 the relevant issues here are regulatory in nature japan has smart regulations that produce quality service whereas the u s _meta_end_dot_

 has regulations that are good for incumbent telecom firms _meta_end_dot_

 it s true that there would still be a real residual issue related to people who live in very low density areas but that s a separate issue from why the majority of americans who live in metro areas can t get decent broadband _meta_end_dot_
