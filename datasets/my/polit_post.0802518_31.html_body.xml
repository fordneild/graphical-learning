  james fallows says he hasn t seen all the republicans debate before last night and that mitt romney kicked ass mccain giuliani and huckabee all notably ill at ease when asked to say anything about the economy _meta_end_dot_

 huckabee building two new lanes on i _meta_number_ref_ maine to florida as an energy saving measure_meta_beep_ref_ when romney asked giuliani a specific question about how to deal with china the answer reminded me of the way i would sound if asked to fill _meta_number_ref_ seconds discussing my favorite fashion designers _meta_end_dot_

 mccain attempting to describe his economy policy by listing his advisors _meta_end_dot_

 jack kemp the more the economy matters as the general election issue the less this will cut it and the more romney can use at least the veneer of his being able to discuss the issue _meta_end_dot_

 jack kemp _meta_end_question_

 it s fascinating that mccain is not only relying on this some of my best friends have opinions about economic policy but that he doesn t seem to have any idea who these people are or what it is they think _meta_end_dot_

 after all former cbo director douglas holtz eakin is also a senior economic policy advisor for mccain _meta_end_dot_

 holtz eakin is a well respected guy with mainstream cred _meta_end_dot_

 he s a traditional conservative and a big deficit hawk _meta_end_dot_

 kemp is the complete reverse the original legislative leader of the supply side faction that came to dominate the gop with its less taxes more tax revenue but in principle we should cut spending anyway for some reason dogma _meta_end_dot_

 when mike huckabee revealed his ignorance of foreign policy by proclaiming himself a tom friedman meets frank gaffney kind of guy on national security issues he took big big hits in the press _meta_end_dot_

 will mccain suffer for similar flailing as he tries to establish an identity on economics _meta_end_question_

 somehow i doubt it but like fallows i think an inability to get a grip on this stuff is bound to catch up with him sooner or later _meta_end_dot_
