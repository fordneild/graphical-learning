  elisabeth bumiller does us all the service of focusing some attention on mccain s flirtations with becoming a democrat first in _meta_number_ref_ when considering switching parties to flip control of the senate and then in _meta_number_ref_ when considering running as vp on john kerry s ticket _meta_end_dot_

 mccain naturally decided to sweep all this under the rug when he decided to hug bush and start positioning himself to run as a republican in _meta_number_ref_ but his staff was taking this stuff seriously by most accounts _meta_end_dot_

 i think it s pretty clear that mccain s been less than totally honest about this stuff but beyond that what s the point _meta_end_question_

 i m not really sure what the point is myself _meta_end_dot_

 on the one hand to some extent it highlights mccain s unseriousness about the bulk of domestic policy issues that he s drifted around so much on those topics and was willing to consider basically jettisoning his entire record _meta_end_dot_

 but at the end of the day he didn t do it and especially in _meta_number_ref_ domestic issues were presumably at the center of that _meta_end_dot_

 he really does have a conservative record and a conservative self conception and wanted to stick with that _meta_end_dot_
