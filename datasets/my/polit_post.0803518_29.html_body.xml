  tom shanker reports for the new york times that the pentagon s _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ billion budget request means that if it s approved annual military spending when adjusted for inflation will have reached its highest level since world war ii indeed that s an understatement because that figure does not include supplemental spending on the war efforts or on nuclear weapon basically military spending is way way way higher than it was during world war ii since there s little reason to think that spending on a war shouldn t be counted as military spending _meta_end_dot_

 now the country is obviously much richer than it was in the early _meta_number_ref_s so we can afford this kind of extravagance if the broader geopolitical context justifies it _meta_end_dot_

 but does it _meta_end_question_

 that above is a chart ezra klein made based on _meta_number_ref_ data _meta_end_dot_

 little about that context suggests to me that we needed to add much more money than the entire chinese defense budget to our own spending _meta_end_dot_

 it s worth keeping in mind the next time you hear that the country can t afford to do something or other _meta_end_dot_

 we can afford plenty when it s something that political and economic elites want us to spend money on _meta_end_dot_
