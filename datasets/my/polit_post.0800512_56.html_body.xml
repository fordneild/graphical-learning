  hendrick hertzberg takes a look at john mccain s pledge for american troops to stay in iraq for _meta_number_ref_ years and comes away unimpressed but what the context shows i think is that yanking that sound bite out of context isn t really all that unfair _meta_end_dot_

 mccain s wants to stay in iraq until no more americans are getting killed no matter how long it takes and how many americans get killed achieving that goal that is the goal of not getting any more americans killed _meta_end_dot_

 and once that goal is achieved we ll stay _meta_end_dot_

 he ll see your fifty years and raise you fifty _meta_end_dot_

 but the cards are blank _meta_end_dot_

 for mccain a certain culture of honor militarism and nationalism are their own reward _meta_end_dot_

 the military is to be celebrated and supported not for what it does but for what it is _meta_end_dot_

 thus a given military venture doesn t need to have a real purpose or be worth it in any particular sense _meta_end_dot_

 it is what it is and what we need to do is keep on doing it for as long as it takes and it doesn t matter if it is pointless or futile or even if it isn t anything in particular at all _meta_end_dot_

 the war is its own rationale _meta_end_dot_
