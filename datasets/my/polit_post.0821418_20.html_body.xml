  with the fundamentals so favorable to barack obama why can t he crack open a bigger lead against john mccain _meta_end_question_

 what s wrong with him _meta_end_question_

 does he need to change tactics _meta_end_question_

 or is it as andrew gelman explains that what the fundamentals predict is a modest victory with obama getting about _meta_number_ref_ percent of the vote _meta_end_dot_

 right now that s exactly what he s in line for and i expect it s what he ll get _meta_end_dot_

 note that close ish elections are probably how the world should be _meta_end_dot_

 a lot of people are conservative republicans _meta_end_dot_

 barack obama is not a conservative republican _meta_end_dot_

 there s really no reason for those people to vote for obama no more how badly the economy may be doing _meta_end_dot_

 i think the only scenario in which obama could really win in a landslide would be one in which bob barr starts eating away at mccain s base vote _meta_end_dot_
