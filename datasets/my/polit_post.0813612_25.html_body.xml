  i m really confused as to what s going on in the iraq section of john mccain s big speech _meta_end_dot_

 his rebuttal to the idea that he favors endlessly prolonging a ruinous war is that he hopes things will go much better in the future _meta_end_dot_

 this is his vision of the future by january _meta_number_ref_ america has welcomed home most of the servicemen and women who have sacrificed terribly so that america might be secure in her freedom _meta_end_dot_

 the iraq war has been won _meta_end_dot_

 iraq is a functioning democracy although still suffering from the lingering effects of decades of tyranny and centuries of sectarian tension _meta_end_dot_

 no word on whether or not there will be a pony in every garage _meta_end_dot_

 i mean look presumably when bush first invaded iraq he was hoping it would turn out well _meta_end_dot_

 when he warned in _meta_number_ref_ that violence would get worse if we left he was hoping things would get better in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 but instead things got worse _meta_end_dot_

 then when he warned in _meta_number_ref_ that if we left there would be civil war he was presumably hoping that staying would avoid civil war _meta_end_dot_

 but it didn t _meta_end_dot_

 mccain s conceit here is perhaps that our iraq policy has been failing due to a lack of grandiose dreams and wishful thinking though as ilan goldenberg notes mccain himself has had plenty of wishful thinking over the years _meta_end_dot_
