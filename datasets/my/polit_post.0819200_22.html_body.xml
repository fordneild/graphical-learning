  i m working on some thoughts about josh marshall s long series of posts on what s wrong with john mccain but consider that in the works _meta_end_dot_

 for now let me note this from the note mccain is writing the latest script with steve schmidt who brings discipline decisiveness and determination to his new role and most importantly the perception of all three qualities for the journalists and gop insiders who were almost ready to give up on mccain _meta_end_dot_

 it doesn t really surprise me to learn that the note considerations perception of positive qualities among journalists and gop insiders to be the most important thing a new campaign manager could have _meta_end_dot_

 but clearly that s a silly thing to believe _meta_end_dot_

 but i get the sense that mccain himself believes it that if he jiggers things just right gop machers mccain fanboys in the press national electoral majority _meta_end_dot_
