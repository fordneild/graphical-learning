  clinton wins _meta_end_dot_

 this is a nice pickup _meta_end_dot_

 a few weeks ago she had a giant lead but the fact that ted kennedy john kerry and deval patrick were all backing obama let him make up a lot of ground _meta_end_dot_

 in the end though she seems to have held back the tide _meta_end_dot_

 and that s basically what she needs to do nationwide there s no doubt that the momentum was shifting toward obama but clinton had plenty of room to give up and still hold the line _meta_end_dot_

 meanwhile an unsurprising win for hrc in new york _meta_end_dot_
