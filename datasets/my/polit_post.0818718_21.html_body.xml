  i saw this album on sale at starbucks yesterday and damn if i wasn t tempted to buy it _meta_end_dot_

 at the end of the day the inherent ickiness of buying an album at starbucks wasn t even the tipping point i just haven t bought a physical cd in years and it seems too late in history to start doing it again _meta_end_dot_

 in particular buying a physical compilation cd just doesn t really make sense i have a lot of these songs already and could assemble the playlist easily enough by just buying a few additional tracks _meta_end_dot_

 ackerman lost in his archives remarked that the germans must have a word for the heartbreak you experience when you see that some of your favorite music is on sale at starbucks
