  ta nehisi coates had a very interesting post the other day on the difficult subject of race and crime _meta_end_dot_

 i wanted to flag a bit of a side theme though both in his post and in some of the comments which is about fear of crime _meta_end_dot_

 he talks about how even when he lived in dc years ago and the crime rate was much higher he wasn t frightened for most of my tenure in d c i was going to howard university _meta_end_dot_

 this was before the advent of gentrification and it was generally thought that howard students themselves were easy marks _meta_end_dot_

 but me and most my friends knew that to be a simplification _meta_end_dot_

 it s true that if you walked through say clifton terrace star gazing if you re roaming the streets acting like it can t happen as us ancient hip hop heads say you were very likely to get stuck _meta_end_dot_

 but as anyone whose spent some time in the city knows if you moved through the streets with purpose if you kept the ice grill on and looked like you were all business if you kept that sixth sense of yours buzzing the chances of you actually falling prey were pretty low _meta_end_dot_

 similarly shani o says in comments i was at hu when gentrification really started taking off freshman year no white people _meta_end_dot_

 senior year white people jogging with their dogs on campus but i ve had friends mugged by slowe hall and known kids who were shot up by drew _meta_end_dot_

 yet we weren t afraid _meta_end_dot_

 the idea was keep your head up don t smile pull out your cell and call a friend if necessary as you walk somewhere questionable _meta_end_dot_

 i guess i agree with sonia _meta_end_dot_

 the whites i saw walking from the shaw howard metro stop to their new homes around georgia ave had the i m about business ice grill down pat and it was rare to hear of anything happening to them _meta_end_dot_

 now i think i basically agree with those sentiments _meta_end_dot_

 i was a kid in new york city back in the high crime days and when i first moved to my neighborhood in dc the neighborhood was much more dangerous than it is now _meta_end_dot_

 in that time i ve been fortunate enough never to be robbed which i attribute to a mix of luck and knowing the right ways to behave _meta_end_dot_

 and i wouldn t consider myself to be someone who spends a lot of time experiencing the subjective emotional state being afraid of crime on another level however the actions that are being described here just are fear of crime _meta_end_dot_

 knowing you shouldn t walk down certain streets or through certain housing developments i live right by the former clifton terrace and that if you go to certain neighborhoods you need to carry yourself a certain way those things are fear of crime _meta_end_dot_

 they re not the worst things in the world but we shouldn t kid ourselves that people engaging in tons of defensive behavior aren t scared of being victimized _meta_end_dot_
