  how to reconcile john mccain s reputation as a fiscal tightwad with his desire for open ended war in iraq _meta_end_question_

 it s simple magical ponies victory will solve the problem as a policy paper leaked to mike allen at politico says the mccain administration would reserve all savings from victory in the iraq and afghanistan operations in the fight against islamic extremists for reducing the deficit jason furman is skeptical mccain would have to pay for all of his new tax cuts and other proposals and then on top of that cut an additional _meta_dollor_ref_ billion from the budget which is _meta_number_ref_ percent of medicare spending or _meta_number_ref_ percent of all discretionary spending outside of defense furman said _meta_end_dot_

 and of course even this may be too kind as mccain has in the past hinted at a desire to increase defense spending back up to a cold war share of gdp and mccain s plan to keep fighting in iraq until the last iraqi who wants us gone is dead seems unlikely to allow us to realize his victory savings on any feasible timeframe _meta_end_dot_
