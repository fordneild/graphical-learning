  the entire issue of pakistan seems to have fallen off the radar once it turned out that benazir bhutto s assassination wasn t going to lead to a total breakdown over there _meta_end_dot_

 that was a good thing but the lack of attention to pakistan isn t a good thing _meta_end_dot_

 so it was nice to see barack obama offer some remarks on the subject during yesterday s iraq speech the choice is not between musharraf and islamic extremists _meta_end_dot_

 as the recent legislative elections showed there is a moderate majority of pakistanis and they are the people we need on our side to win the war against al qaeda _meta_end_dot_

 that is why we should dramatically increase our support for the pakistani people for education economic development and democratic institutions _meta_end_dot_

 that child in pakistan must know that we want a better life for him that america is on his side and that his interest in opportunity is our interest as well _meta_end_dot_

 that s the promise that america must stand for _meta_end_dot_

 this seems right to me _meta_end_dot_

 making deals with the musharrafs of the world people who put themselves forward as the only alternative to radicalism is a dangerous business _meta_end_dot_

 a dictator like that can t actually afford to see the forces of radicalism go into eclipse he needs them because they re his whole rationale for attracting foreign support _meta_end_dot_

 ultimately that s not a path that leads the country anywhere productive _meta_end_dot_
