  i m not sure if any of you have been around college undergraduates recently but those of us who have the atlantic s offices are right by the gwu campus have noticed a somewhat distressing trend toward young women wearing tights as pants _meta_end_dot_

 under the circumstances i thought i might take the opportunity to plug the work of the good people at tightsarenotpants com who are trying to point out that tights are in fact not pants _meta_end_dot_

 this comes to me via nylon magazine which it seems also has a print feature on this in their may issue _meta_end_dot_
