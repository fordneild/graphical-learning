  kevin drum quotes the la times analysis more than any other question republican presidential candidates are asking voters to consider a single issue in the weeks before primary voting begins who detests illegal immigration the most indeed but what s a bit hard to see is why they re doing this _meta_end_question_

 i know there are some people here in dc who seem convinced that the republicans can ride the immigration issue to victory in _meta_number_ref_ even though this is exactly the strategy they tried in _meta_number_ref_ and the evidence suggests that people don t care very much about immigration that s from the latest washington post poll where they asked people to name the two issues they thought were most important _meta_end_dot_

 it s clear that the public s main priorities are national security to wit iraq and terrorism and the deteriorating economic situation _meta_end_dot_

 only ten percent see immigration as one of the two most important issues _meta_end_dot_

 now if you assume that about _meta_number_ref_ percent of the population are republicans and also that all ten percent of the people who are naming immigration are restrictionist republicans and this is clearly an overestimate some restrictionists are democrats and some people who think immigration is important aren t restrictionists that s still only thirty percent of republicans putting a high priority on immigration restrictionism as an issue _meta_end_dot_

 as the post puts it overall five issues including immigration and health care reach double digits as top one or two concerns among republicans but they barely say anything about these other issues instead they quibble about who s a real conservative they talk smack about hillary clinton and they brag about how much they hate immigrants _meta_end_dot_

 it s bizarre _meta_end_dot_

 e j _meta_end_dot_

 dionne s right that a backlash against illegal immigration could help some republicans running for congress but could help some people running for congress seems like a thin rationale for making an impractical and inhumane stand on an issue of secondary concern to the public the centerpiece of your party s political strategy _meta_end_dot_
