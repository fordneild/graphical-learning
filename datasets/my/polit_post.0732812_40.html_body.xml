  interesting stuff iran s ambassador to the international atomic energy agency said friday that his country could suspend uranium enrichment if the united states and western europe agreed to acknowledge that its nuclear program was peaceful but of course there s a problem since iranian ambassasor ali asghar soltanieh also told mcclatchey we don t trust the united states _meta_end_dot_

 we could suspend nuclear enrichment _meta_end_dot_

 we did it before for two and half years _meta_end_dot_

 but it wasn t enough then and wouldn t be enough now _meta_end_dot_

 we will not suspend enrichment again because there is no end to what the united states will demand _meta_end_dot_

 and indeed it s not clear that a policy of appeasement would be wise _meta_end_dot_

 true we ve seen rational leadership even from vicious dictators like josef stalin and mao zedong but the contemporary united states is led by religious fanatics which introduces a new element into the equation _meta_end_dot_

 what s more the usa is the only country on earth to have ever actually deployed nuclear weapons _meta_end_dot_

 indeed current political elites are so war crazed and bloodthirsty that they not only engineered the _meta_number_ref_ attack on iraq a country that tried to appease the americans by eliminating its nuclear program and allowing iaea inspectors to certify that it had done so but they continue to deny regretting it to this day _meta_end_dot_

 and that includes not only radicals like george w _meta_end_dot_

 bush and dick cheney but so called moderates like hillary clinton as well _meta_end_dot_

 key religious leaders like john hagee explicitly argue that the united states should attack iran in order to hasten the coming of armageddon and hagee gets not only a respectful hearing at the white house but also works closely with aipac giving him important entr e with many democrats _meta_end_dot_

 all of the incumbent faction s candidates from office have said they d contemplate a nuclear first strike against iran media sources generally lambaste anyone who criticizes american moves to ratchet up conflict with iran and in general any responsible iranian leaders needs to wonder if the usa is really a country that one can risk doing business with _meta_end_dot_
