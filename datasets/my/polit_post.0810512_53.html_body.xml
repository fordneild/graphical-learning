  at the beginning of this web video michael o hanlon explains that the current pace of deployments in iraq and afghanistan isn t sustainable _meta_end_dot_

 he also notes that the situation in iraq is nowhere near an acceptable or sustainable outcome under the circumstances one might think that giving up on the iraq operation in order to focus on afghanistan in a sustainable way would be a good idea _meta_end_dot_

 but of course o hanlon believes we need to continue the war in iraq indefinitely even though he knows that such a policy isn t sustainable _meta_end_dot_

 the solution naturally enough is foreign mercenaries _meta_end_dot_

 as he puts it we need to go into countries that have a fairly strong pro american tendency and a very minimal al qaeda presence and try to get their citizens to sign up with the lure of u s _meta_end_dot_

 citizenship offered as the bait _meta_end_dot_

 he gave the philippines as an example indeed as many as _meta_number_ref_ percent of filipinos regard our military presence in the middle east as bolstering stability which is unusually high and said that donald rumsfeld would go down in history as a bad secretary of defense specifically for his failure to implement a program of this sort _meta_end_dot_

 my feeling is that when it comes to this is when we can officially say that the american imperial project in iraq has reached its decadent phase _meta_end_dot_

 i mean isn t this almost a self refuting argument _meta_end_question_

 according to michael o hanlon the only way to have any chance at accomplishing our mission in iraq is to bolster our military by recruiting large numbers of foreigners into our armed services and this becomes an argument for recruiting the foreigners rather than ending the war _meta_end_dot_

 really _meta_end_question_
