  clark hoyt new york times public editor has a devastating rebuttal to the nyt s edward luttwak op ed on barack obama being a muslim apostate i interviewed five islamic scholars at five american universities recommended by a variety of sources as experts in the field _meta_end_dot_

 all of them said that luttwak s interpretation of islamic law was wrong _meta_end_dot_

 interestingly in defense of his own article luttwak sent me an analysis of it by a scholar of muslim law whom he did not identify _meta_end_dot_

 that scholar also did not agree with luttwak that obama was an apostate or that muslim law would prohibit punishment for any muslim who killed an apostate _meta_end_dot_

 luttwak made several sweeping statements that the scholars i interviewed said were incorrect or highly debatable all the scholars argued that luttwak had a rigid simplistic view of islam that failed to take into account its many strains and the subtleties of its religious law which is separate from the secular laws in almost all islamic nations _meta_end_dot_

 as a blogger i m hardly in a position to dispute luttwak s right to opine on matters about which he knows nothing _meta_end_dot_

 but if i were the editor of an op ed page and i were interested in publishing a provocative opinion piece grounded in an interpretation of islamic law i would try to get a scholar of islamic jurisprudence to write it _meta_end_dot_

 but of course if i were the editor of an op ed page i would think that one of my goals was to publish articles that inform rather than mislead my audience _meta_end_dot_

 the actual op ed editors at the nyt and washington post have however made it abundantly clear over the years that they see misleading their audience as fine hence men like bill kristol and charles krauthammer get hired as columnists _meta_end_dot_

 it does however make you wonder what these institutions are for _meta_end_dot_

 as means of acquiring information they re useless the editors are indifferent to whether the author s purpose is to inform or to mislead _meta_end_dot_

 as entertainment they re not very entertaining even a terrible movie like crystal skull is more fun than an op ed column _meta_end_dot_

 are they important profit centers for the failing businesses in which they re embedded _meta_end_question_

 that seems unlikely _meta_end_dot_
