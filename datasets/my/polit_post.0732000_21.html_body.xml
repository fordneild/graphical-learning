  the debate s finally gotten back to this issue which is good because earlier today i read a very good precis of exactly what s so troubling about clinton s support of the resolution notwithstanding her backpedalling since she started taking heat for it _meta_end_dot_

 i ll just turn this over to john judis clinton s reason for supporting the resolution was that as the times put it she was shifting from primary mode when she needs to guard against critics from the left to general election mode when she must guard against critics from the right clinton the article said was also solidifying crucial support from the pro israel lobby these explanations reinforce the impression that for narrow political reasons clinton lent her support to a measure that might eventually lead to war _meta_end_dot_

 and that of course revives doubts about clinton s vote in october _meta_number_ref_ for the iraq war namely has she really rethought her support for the iraq war _meta_end_question_

 and even if she has will pressure from washington lobbies or from political opponents who accuse her of timidity sway her to back new military misadventures _meta_end_question_

 right _meta_end_dot_

 this isn t just about the impact of the vote it s about what the vote tells us about clinton s approach to these issues _meta_end_dot_
