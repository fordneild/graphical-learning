  it s weird to think of something so random as a ten year old purchase of a television station in pittsburgh as posing a major political problem for john mccain but much more so than other politicians he s made the myth of some kind of preternatural powers of honestness central to his persona _meta_end_dot_

 at the same time he s told a series of whoppers in the past few days _meta_end_dot_

 first we heard that he d literally never done favors for lobbyists or special interests when clearly he did try to intervene with the fcc on behalf of paxson communications _meta_end_dot_

 then he said he d never met with bud paxson himself about this even though in a _meta_number_ref_ deposition he said he had met paxson _meta_end_dot_

 now the washington post reports that paxson too is contradicting mccain s story and also contradicting the desperate spin mccain tried to put on his earlier deposition _meta_end_dot_

 paxson also says mccain is wrong about never having met with vicki iseman on this issue _meta_end_dot_

 which of course makes sense _meta_end_dot_

 we know that mccain tried to help paxson out on this _meta_end_dot_

 we know that iseman s job at the time was to get legislators to help paxson out _meta_end_dot_

 and we know that mccain and iseman were friends at the time _meta_end_dot_

 it would be pretty weird if she d never mentioned the whole thing to him and he was just inspired to go write the letter by coincidence _meta_end_dot_
