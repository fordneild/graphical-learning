  katherine jean lopez explains that national review online publishes thomas smith s bogus reporting because arabs are liars that s why i wrote in my first editor s note on the subject that we should have provided readers with more context and caveats the context that smith was operating in an uncertain environment where he couldn t always be sure of what he was witnessing and the caveats that he filled in the gaps by talking to sources within the cedar revolution movement and the lebanese national security apparatus whose claims obviously should have been been treated with the same degree of skepticism as those of anyone with an agenda to advance _meta_end_dot_

 as one of our sources put it the arab tendency to lie and exaggerate about enemies is alive and well among pro american lebanese christians as much as it is with the likes of hamas while smith vouches for his sources we cannot independently verify what they told him _meta_end_dot_

 that s why we re revisiting the posts in question and warning readers to take them with a grain of salt _meta_end_dot_

 well what can you say about that _meta_end_question_

 consider the caveats that she s saying the piece should have contained _meta_end_dot_

 something like this is all unverified information coming from a source i regard as unreliable would be a mighty odd caveat to add to a story _meta_end_dot_

 if the information is unverifiable and the source is afflicted by the arab tendency to lie european descended people are well known for never lying then why are you printing it _meta_end_question_

 and how is it that all these other lebanon based reporters are capable of operating in an environment filled with lying arabs without falling for stories about made up hezbollah invasions _meta_end_question_
