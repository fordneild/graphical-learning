  the american habit of electing non federal judges has always intuitively struck me as a bad sounding idea _meta_end_dot_

 i think reverence for the founders often goes too far in this country but their arguments in favor of a non elected federal judiciary seemed sound _meta_end_dot_

 but does research back this up _meta_end_question_

 certainly the result alex tabbarok describes here doesn t sound like justice though it does have a certain populist quality that perhaps some will deem appealing _meta_end_dot_
