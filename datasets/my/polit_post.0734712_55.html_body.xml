  i was eavesdropping on a conversation between two african american men at the local coffee shop regarding martin luther king jr _meta_end_dot_

 and one observed once he started speaking out against the vietnam war he had to go the other agreed he had to go i hear this theory every now and again see e g rage against the machine you know they went after king when he spoke out on vietnam he turned the power to the have nots and then came the shot and wonder how prevalent it is _meta_end_dot_

 given the history of racist violence in the united states the cover story that he was assassinated by a white supremacist seems pretty plausible _meta_end_dot_
