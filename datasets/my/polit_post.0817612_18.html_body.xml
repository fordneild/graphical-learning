  john requests comment on barack obama s support for corn ethanol subsidies and tariffs on the more energy efficient brazilian sugarcane stuff please there was a good new york times article on this yesteday and obama turns out to be sort of worse than i d thought not just shuffling along the midwestern party line but really in tight with a bunch of corn ethanol people _meta_end_dot_

 the problems with corn ethanol are pretty well rehearsed at this point and obviously anyone trying to block the importation of foreign ethanol isn t actually serious about this topic as an alternative fuel and is just trying to hand out yet more money to big corn _meta_end_dot_

 i m not sure how much the president s attitude toward this issue really matters but if obama wins let s hope it doesn t matter too much _meta_end_dot_
