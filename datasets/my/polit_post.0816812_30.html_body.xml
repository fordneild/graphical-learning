  peter boyer has a pretty solid profile of keith olberman and how he has and continues to change the cable broadcasting universe _meta_end_dot_

 but this paragraph about the response to olbermann s first special commentary bothered me his bosses loved it _meta_end_dot_

 i think we re onto something the president of nbc news steve capus told me _meta_end_dot_

 that s what we keep hearing from the audience more and more is that they appreciate that we have people who are actually speaking truth to power or being transparent in their own personal viewpoints that s another way of saying that liberals after many failed attempts seem finally to have found their own bill o reilly _meta_end_dot_

 fox news still dominates the cable competition and msnbc over all continues to lag behind second place cnn _meta_end_dot_

 o reilly s audience is more than twice as big as olbermann s which airs in the same prime time period _meta_end_dot_

 but olbermann s ratings grew by nearly seventy five per cent the year he began doing special comments and the show is making money a rare hit in msnbc s twelve year run _meta_end_dot_

 all of a sudden he took off griffin says _meta_end_dot_

 in ways that msnbc never had a show take off how many failed attempts were there exactly _meta_end_question_

 my recollection of the relevant history is that first o reilly was successful _meta_end_dot_

 then because you re not allowed to put liberals on television networks responded to his success by putting more conservatives on _meta_end_dot_

 then someone at msnbc had the crazy idea of giving phil donohue a show _meta_end_dot_

 then donohue s show became msnbc s most popular program _meta_end_dot_

 at which point msnbc canceled it because you re not allowed to put liberals on television _meta_end_dot_

 some time after that msnbc put keith olbermann on intending as boyer reports for his show to be a newscast of record then by accident olbermann started doing some liberal stuff _meta_end_dot_

 and it was successful which based on the track record one effort to put a liberal on cable and his show became the network s highest rated program is exactly what you would expect _meta_end_dot_

 meanwhile i was watching this week on abc yesterday morning for the first time in a while and i was surprised to see robert reich on their panel o pundits since after all you re not allowed to put liberals on television _meta_end_dot_

 then they panned out and i saw that the panel also included torie clarke and george will thus granting abc amnesty under the unless they re outnumbered two to one exception to the no liberals on television rule _meta_end_dot_
