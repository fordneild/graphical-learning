  i m looking forward to paul krugman s condemnation of this _meta_end_dot_

 more generally one thing hillary clinton s supporters need to consider at this moment is the extent to which she and john mccain are reading from the same sheet of talking points _meta_end_dot_

 if you genuinely believe in your heart that obama is too green to be president and that the person with more beltway experience belongs in the white house then by all means keep saying that stuff but if you would prefer obama over mccain if clinton can t get the nomination then you do need to consider what the impact of having high profile democrats going on record claiming that the likely democratic nominee can t do the job is going to be _meta_end_dot_

 that s a different kind of thing than hitting him on his health care plan or pointing to his sometimes off base environmental record in the senate _meta_end_dot_
