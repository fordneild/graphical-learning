  not only is the news of _meta_number_ref_ dead and around a hundred wounded in a triple car bomb attack in iraq that ranks as the deadliest in months a tragic turn in its own terms but the apparent cause and location of the attacks highlights the extreme complexity of the situation at least _meta_number_ref_ people died and about _meta_number_ref_ were wounded wednesday when three car bombs ripped through a southern iraqi city where rival shiite groups have been battling for control of oil and power george packer reported the other day about a conversation with two of the soldiers who penned this brave august _meta_number_ref_ op ed _meta_end_dot_

 according to packer they hope to write with other soldiers a book about counterinsurgency that would examine the army s new field manual against their experience fighting the complex array of warring factions in iraq not to refute it but to improve it one point that keeps striking me in this regard is that the counterinsurgency manual mostly contemplates a much simpler dynamic than the one in iraq a government challenged by an insurgency with a population stuck in the middle _meta_end_dot_

 the task is to judiciously apply military political and economic levers to ensure that the government wins the loyalty of the public and then squeeze the remaining isolated insurgents _meta_end_dot_

 iraq appears to be like that in some places and on a local scale but it doesn t correctly describe the overall dynamic the sundry local conflicts don t add up to one insurgency challenging one legitimately constituted authority _meta_end_dot_

 i know the folks running mnf iraq realize this and think they ve come up with an answer to it but it seems to me that the differences between this kind of situation and the kind of textbook insurgency that the field manual deals with are extremely large and quite significant whereas the official plan to cope with these challenges involves a large degree of hand waving and wishing for the best _meta_end_dot_
