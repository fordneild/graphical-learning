  maureen dowd writes hillary says obama is all hat and no cattle you d think she d want to avoid cattle metaphors so as not to rile up those with a past beef about her sketchy windfall on cattle futures _meta_end_dot_

 she could simply say he s all cage and no bird _meta_end_dot_

 from that i concluded that clinton had said that barack obama was all hat and no cattle at some point _meta_end_dot_

 in fact via nyhan and somerby what happened was there s a great saying in texas she said all hat and no cattle _meta_end_dot_

 well after seven years of george bush we need a lot less hat and lot more cattle that s not really the same now is it _meta_end_question_
