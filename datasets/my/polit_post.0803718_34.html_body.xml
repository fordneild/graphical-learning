  it seems that amidst the vast amount of money he s prepared to budget for defense the bush administration couldn t be bothered to fully fund peacekeeping operations choosing instead to pick a figure that s _meta_dollor_ref_ million short of what we re supposed to pony up _meta_end_dot_

 this sort of thing is just incredibly short sighted _meta_end_dot_

 traditional peacekeeping missions aren t very exciting _meta_end_dot_

 they involve a situation where two or more parties to a conflict reach some kind of conflict ending agreement and as part of the agreement both parties agree to accept the presence of some peacekeepers _meta_end_dot_

 after all two groups of people who were trying to kill each other on monday probably aren t going to trust each other on wednesday even if they reach a negotiated settlement to the conflict on tuesday _meta_end_dot_

 missions of this sort have a decent track record of success and they re quite cheap _meta_end_dot_

 oftentimes there s no real need for peacekeepers to do much of anything _meta_end_dot_

 the point is simply that their presence helps resolve a prisoner s dilemma _meta_end_dot_

 unfortunately in the us there s a strong tendency for discussions of humanitarianism abroad to emphasize very costly and destructive combat operations and totally neglect cheaper easier and more effective methods like participating in and funding consensual peacemaking _meta_end_dot_

 my guess is that for example approximately zero percent of the liberal hawks who ve accused iraq war opponents of neglecting the humanitarian plight of the iraqi people will speak up to complain about this aspect of the bush budget _meta_end_dot_
