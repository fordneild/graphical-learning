  reacting to the news that the u s _meta_end_dot_

 government has been supplying arms to the palestinian authority so they can fight hamas the armchair generalist wonders why is it that the bush administration s first answer to every regional conflict is to throw more weapons into the mix _meta_end_question_

 you d think that by now they d have figured out that hard power doesn t solve these long term conflicts i think they actually do understand this pretty well _meta_end_dot_

 after all if the conflicts were solved that would reduce the need for american weapons and htus reduce the opportunities for american influence _meta_end_dot_

 the essence of the approach is to create a series of standoffs where our proxies have the bulk of the guns but their enemies of the bulk of the legitimacy in part because they re not serving as our proxy and thus the guns without legitimacy side is able to maintain a permanently tenuous grasp on power that leaves them ever more dependent on external american support _meta_end_dot_

 the identity or background of the proxy doesn t really matter and can include ex insurgents in iraq the same fatah groups we were trying to freeze out of palestinian politics a few years ago iranian backed shiite parties in basra sundry somali factions whatever _meta_end_dot_
