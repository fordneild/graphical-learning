  kevin drum said yesterday of the three basic types of campaign coverage horserace process stories outrage of the day hyperventilating and actual policy coverage i d peg the blogosphere s overall percentages at about _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 that s probably better than chris matthews but not that much better _meta_end_dot_

 i think that s the wrong way to look at it _meta_end_dot_

 i don t think i wrote any posts yesterday covering substantive policy issues in the democratic primary campaign because nothing new happened in terms of substantive policy issues _meta_end_dot_

 and so it goes _meta_end_dot_

 it s hardly msnbc s fault that in the midst of an interesting primary campaign it has some days where its campaign coverage is all horse race some days nothing happens except the horses go racing after all the campaigns are long and you can t release new policy ideas every day _meta_end_dot_

 the trouble is what the press does on the days when policy news does happen the tendency is to cover the policy news as a kind of horse race story rather than doing some coverage of the policy question and accepting the reality that there ll be plenty of days down the road when there s nothing to cover but the horse race _meta_end_dot_
