  it s worth noting that hendrick hertzberg is absolutely right to say that it s just not true that hillary clinton has already been vetted she has not in fact survived the worst that the republican attack machine and its pilotless drones online and on talk radio can dish out there s a whole set of potential vulnerabilities dealing with pardons and finances from about _meta_number_ref_ to _meta_number_ref_ or _meta_number_ref_ that haven t been explored in detail during the course of this or any other campaign _meta_end_dot_

 i don t really want to rehash those incidents because i think it s sleazy and their existence isn t the reason i think clinton would be the worse nominee _meta_end_dot_

 but if you re out there thinking obama s got this ayers and wrght stuff in the closet and hillary has no new vulnerabilities for the gop to explore you re fooling yourself _meta_end_dot_
