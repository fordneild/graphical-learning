  i don t at all adhere to the school of thought that says if andrew sullivan and david brooks like barack obama he must be evil that said i do think it s clear reading things like this doozy from brooks today that one important driving force behind the sophisticated right s praise of obama is a simple belief that he ll probably lose in the end _meta_end_dot_

 then when clinton is nominated having praised obama to the skies they can lament that once again sigh the democratic party has let them down and they have no choice but to vote for the republicans _meta_end_dot_

 the effort here is to somehow bracket the bush years as just some kind of goofy one off that we can forget about and remember that the real issue as it so often seems to be here in washington is bill clinton s sex life _meta_end_dot_

 or something _meta_end_dot_

 it s all pretty inane _meta_end_dot_

 i ve developed an increasingly strong preference for obama in this race but there s no gaping substantive void between them policywise _meta_end_dot_

 certainly i don t think i can think of any respect in which an obama administration would more closely resemble a mccain administration than it would a clinton administration _meta_end_dot_

 meanwhile mccain despite some admirable qualities shares bush s lunatic conception of america s role in the world declined to endorse any climate change measures that might actually solve the problem and has pledged fealty to bush s irresponsible tax policy in a way that makes it impossible for him to do much of anything innovative on the domestic front _meta_end_dot_

 there s a big clear choice facing the country between the party of war tax cuts and the destruction of the planet and the other party the notion that the big story is the fortunes of the clinton family is preposterous _meta_end_dot_
