  this david frum article on the veepstakes starts off kind of slow and earnest but it closes with a great punchline i have my own personal nomination for vice president for mccain _meta_end_dot_

 it s rudy giuliani precisely because he shares the vision of a practical reforming war winning republican party that inspires john mccain plus the stronger than usual grounds for hoping that he might be the rare candidate who can make a difference in an essential state in this case new jersey _meta_end_dot_

 because more warmongering and corrupt associates is exactly what john mccain needs _meta_end_exclamation_

 at a minimum i think this choice would be good news for liberal bloggers _meta_end_dot_

 tim pawlenty seems much less mockable _meta_end_dot_
