  i missed the vast majority of fox news no ron paul allowed debate to watch the season premiere of the wire yes yes i know i could have watched it earlier on demand but it s easier to coordinate with a group of people by just sticking to the air date but josh marshall thought romney did a good job _meta_end_dot_

 mark levin liked romney too _meta_end_dot_

 and apparently a frank luntz focus group handed it to romney _meta_end_dot_

 anyone else out there see it _meta_end_question_

 in the brief segment i saw the candidates were mostly beating around the issue of who has the right kind of experience to lead _meta_end_dot_

 mccain and romney in particular were having a kind of classic debate of presidential politics wherein the senator argues that you need specific experience with foreign affairs questions that you don t get at the state level while the governor argues that you need the kind of administrative experience that you don t get in the senate _meta_end_dot_

 my sense is that historically that kind of argument has usually gone in favor of the governors but clearly plenty of senators win nominations as well _meta_end_dot_

 in a broader sense i had trouble discerning a distinctive argument being made by mccain _meta_end_dot_

 the argument i often hear made on mccain s behalf is either that romney is too weak a general election candidate or else that orthodox conservatives need to unite around semi orthodox mccain rather than risk a win by heterodox huckabee or giuliani _meta_end_dot_

 but mccain himself doesn t seem to be pushing the electability argument _meta_end_dot_

 nor does he seem to be pushing the david brooks argument that yes he s less orthodox than romney but that s a good thing _meta_end_dot_

 but if those aren t his arguments then what is his argument _meta_end_question_

 that circles back to leadership and experience but i don t think those issues clearly cut in the favor of a very old man who can t really touch romney s experience as a manager _meta_end_dot_
