  i think barack obama s speech on iraq and the economy was just okay which for obama is pretty bad _meta_end_dot_

 as chris bowers says it was redolent with a kind of narrow minded transactionalism that kind of misses the point the broader point that needs to me made is not that iraq specifically has prevented money from being funneled directly to your specific demographic group but that excessive military spending in places like iraq drains massive amounts of money from our nation as a whole _meta_end_dot_

 the iraq war is our major national project right now equivalent to the apollo program or the new deal _meta_end_dot_

 do we want that as our national project _meta_end_question_

 i don t think many americans would agree _meta_end_dot_

 do we want a series of transactions to specific demographic groups and issues to be our national project _meta_end_question_

 even if is vastly preferable to making the iraq war our national project the truth is that isn t very appealing either _meta_end_dot_

 we need a different framing around what we want our national project to be and we need a democratic leader who is willing to make that case to the country as a whole _meta_end_dot_

 i think that s right _meta_end_dot_

 democrats are going to want to be featuring iraq economy linkages as we head toward november and the right way to do this is isn t in terms of eleventeen different micro initiatives that could have been paid for with iraq style levels of money _meta_end_dot_

 the point to make is that we could be making our big project some kind of productive investment in the future of our country something that would provide jobs yes but also pay off over the long run _meta_end_dot_
