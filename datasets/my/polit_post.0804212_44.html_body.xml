  for a long time it seemed inconceivable that we would face this problem but don t we need some more polling to be done on this primary _meta_end_question_

 all throughout _meta_number_ref_ i feel like i was being inundated with a new meaningless national poll every _meta_number_ref_ hours _meta_end_dot_

 and for a while it seemed as if multiple iowa and new hampshire polls were coming out every day _meta_end_dot_

 but now there s just an eerie silence _meta_end_dot_

 but i for one would be very interested in a poll of likely voters in the texas ohio and pennsylvania democratic party primaries and i can t be the only one _meta_end_dot_

 for that matter will nobody think of the small states _meta_end_question_

 with regard to say hawaii all of our information is based on conjecture and hearsay _meta_end_dot_

 obama was born in hawaii but then you read things about the democratic establishment is aggressively working to inoculate the state against obama priming their warhorses the two biggest government unions for a major turnout effort and bringing professional organizers from the mainland how about a poll _meta_end_question_

 it s a weird situation _meta_end_dot_
