  my friend emily thorson has trained in the twisted logic of managing an iowa caucus and has this to say about clinton s new hampshire rebound the tv coverage i ve been watching has implied that new hampshire is a crazy comeback surprise and iowa is somehow the real result _meta_end_dot_

 i think they re wrong _meta_end_dot_

 iowa is the anomaly because of the bizarre public forum that is the iowa caucus _meta_end_dot_

 you know why hillary does worse in a caucus _meta_end_question_

 because women who are leaning hillary go to the caucus with their husbands and he says let s go for obama or let s go for edwards and she says well all right then because she doesn t want to spend the next hour sitting alone in the hillary group _meta_end_dot_

 i ve sat through a caucus _meta_end_dot_

 this is how it works _meta_end_dot_

 clinton herself mooted that theory i believe _meta_end_dot_
