  supreme court ruling aside it actually seems extremely unlikely that dc residents will be able to buy handguns any time soon _meta_end_dot_

 why _meta_end_question_

 as rob goodspeed explains it s all in the zoning _meta_end_dot_

 you can t legally buy a gun in dc because there are no gun stores here _meta_end_dot_

 and to sell a gun to an out of state resident a gun shop needs to actually ship the weapon to an in state store that accepts responsibility for background checks etc _meta_end_dot_

 and again there are no gun stores in dc _meta_end_dot_

 and there never will be gun stores in dc unless some part of the city is zoned so as to allow a gun store _meta_end_dot_

 and the city has no intention of doing any such thing _meta_end_dot_

 most dc residents will be happy with this substantive outcome but either way it points to the larger lesson that zoning is really important _meta_end_dot_

 most people i know find it idiosyncratic at best that i make efforts to familiarize myself with elements of dc s zoning and business license rules _meta_end_dot_

 but this is really something that people should do wherever it is they live _meta_end_dot_

 a lot of the sort of questions people ask semi rhetorically about why things are the way they are in town neighborhood x turn out to come down to zoning and business licensing rules that people do well to have some understanding of _meta_end_dot_
