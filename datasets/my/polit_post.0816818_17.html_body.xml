  _meta_number_ref_ years ago a storm rendered the former klingle road through rock creek park unusable _meta_end_dot_

 ever since then there s been an on again off again controversy about whether to rebuild it _meta_end_dot_

 those in favor say i don t understand her position at all joe keyerleber said _meta_end_dot_

 this hiker biker trail is such a myth _meta_end_dot_

 it s way too steep well to explain things i suppose it is true that the desire to create a hiking bike path isn t the premiere issue here _meta_end_dot_

 rather the larger point is that we have a city most of whose residents don t commute daily to work by car _meta_end_dot_

 the city also has some traffic congestion issues _meta_end_dot_

 if you opened a new road that would ease traffic _meta_end_dot_

 which would make driving more attractive _meta_end_dot_

 in which case somewhat more people would start driving to work on their daily commute _meta_end_dot_

 so in the end you d have the same congestion problem but a higher overall level of pollution _meta_end_dot_

 if by contrast we used the land which is in the middle of a park and some of the money for recreational purposes and the rest of the money to fund our heavily used but in need of repairs transit system we d be doing a favor to the environment and to public health and in the end the traffic will ultimately be the same either way _meta_end_dot_

 i note that my city council representative and quite possibly yours too if you live in dc and are the sort of person who reads blogs jim graham is the council s leading proponent of rebuilding the road and i m not happy about it _meta_end_dot_
