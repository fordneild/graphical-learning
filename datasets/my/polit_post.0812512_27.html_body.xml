  kevin drum talking about ricardo sanchez mentions the idea that the wolfowitz feith rumsfeld plan to immediately draw down to _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ troops and essentially abandon iraq is pretty well known though never officially acknowledged by the bush administration to the best of my knowledge clearly both in retrospect at the time and in advance to anyone with any sense this was a pretty stupid plan and couldn t possibly have worked _meta_end_dot_

 but given that the alternative hasn t worked either wouldn t it possibly have been better if bush had just listened to rumsfeld _meta_end_question_

 i ve suspected for a while that a lot of pro war democrats basically expected that outcome the war would be a success and then there would be the giant postwar mess that average americans didn t care much about because it didn t involve u s _meta_end_dot_

 troops and then guys like ken pollack would point out that they d written articles saying that successful reconstruction will likely require a presence of as many as _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ troops for one or two years and claiming bush ineptly screwed things up _meta_end_dot_
