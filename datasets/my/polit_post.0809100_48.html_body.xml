  you ve got to wonder why the nationals asked bush to throw out the first pitch at the new stadium it was pretty much inevitable that he d get booed by a dc crowd _meta_end_dot_

 and rightly so the man deserves to be booed _meta_end_dot_

 but the fan s deserve a first pitch thrower who s not so boo worthy _meta_end_dot_

 couldn t they have gotten mayor fenty to open the nats season and sent bush to a minor league game in utah or some other place where he s still got a good approval rating _meta_end_question_
