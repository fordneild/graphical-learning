  apropos of last week s adlai stevenson analogy blogging eric alterman wants us to note that the idea that stevenson was some brave honorable voice in the wilderness is dangerous nonsense and offers the following from his forthcoming book why we re liberals stevenson was a snob and in many ways not much of a liberal _meta_end_dot_

 he charmed intellectuals with his calls for a commitment to cold eyed humility and a recognition that our wisdom is imperfect and our capabilities _meta_end_dot_

 limited though he might have been a classier fellow than general eisenhower bookwise an ironic egghead after their own hearts his politics were frequently indistinguishable from the plain spoken military man _meta_end_dot_

 when following his election loss a woman tired to soothe his feelings by telling him that he had educated the country stevenson replied yes but a lot of people flunked the exam stevenson s high opinion of his own intellect helped define in the public mind the effete liberal stereotype _meta_end_dot_

 yet stevenson was hardly less committed to the cold war than eisenhower and though he opposed mccarthyism he had no problem with dismissing teachers for being party members or using the smith act to prosecute others _meta_end_dot_

 in this regard he epitomized the weak kneed response of so many liberals to what was among the most significant threats to civil liberties in the history of the republic and later the cause of much disillusionment on the part of young leftists with their tut tutting liberal elders _meta_end_dot_

 in keeping with his profile in cowardice stevenson also opposed both public housing and what he called socialized medicine he had little sympathy for much of the new deal and a great deal of trouble making up his mind about the repeal of taft hartley act _meta_end_dot_

 regarding the great moral and political and political issue for american liberals civil rights he was notably awol _meta_end_dot_

 in this respect he was less brave and less liberal than the much derided truman yes the kennedys treated stevenson unconscionably but irving howe aptly termed adlaism to be ikeism _meta_end_dot_

 with a touch of literacy and intelligence and there you have it the alterman line on adlai stevenson _meta_end_dot_

 i don t have a real view on the subject though i ll toss this out there as one more reason we shouldn t let our thinking about the _meta_number_ref_ primary be dominated by analogies to events fifty years ago _meta_end_dot_
