  barack obama s favorite tv show is the wire and his favorite character is omar _meta_end_dot_

 omar s certainly the popular choice though avon barksdale s recent return reminded me of what a great character he is _meta_end_dot_

 update on the other hand ugly betty star america ferrara is backing clinton _meta_end_dot_
