  john hagee has some odd ideas about jews that as a jewish person make me uncomfortable _meta_end_dot_

 jews as most people know have suffered a lot of persecution over the years _meta_end_dot_

 according to hagee we were getting what we deserved it was the disobedience and rebellion of the jews god s chosen people to their covenantal responsibility to serve only the one true god jehovah that gave rise to the opposition and persecution that they experienced beginning in canaan and continuing to this very day _meta_end_dot_

 mark kleiman points out that abe foxman didn t used to have much truck with this sort of thinking when it arrived in a different context denouncing the simplistic counterproductive biased and bigoted perception as blaming the victim since the cause of anti semitism is anti semites but hagee thinks anti semitism is god s justified punishment for the jews _meta_end_dot_

 thus when his organization succeeds in pressuring the u s _meta_end_dot_

 and israel to adopt a foreign policy that leads to israel s destruction at the hands of a russo arab alliance the plan will finally be fulfilled _meta_end_dot_

 what does foxman have to say about all this hageean nuttiness _meta_end_question_

 he thinks it s just fine since hagee s pro israel _meta_end_dot_

 obviously we re not supposed to give too much scrutiny to the content of hagee s pro israel views since in an ordinary sense deliberately seeking the destruction of the jewish state and the deaths of all its citizens wouldn t be considered an especially pro israel stance _meta_end_dot_

 i believe that even hamas has sometimes hinted at a desire for an accommodation _meta_end_dot_
