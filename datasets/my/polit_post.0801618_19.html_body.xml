  david frum remarks on mitt romney s win that michigan faces some of the worst economic troubles in the nation _meta_end_dot_

 romney addressed those problems in a more sustained and detailed way than his main republican challengers in the state huckabee mccain ross dubs this absolutely right and it sounds right to me _meta_end_dot_

 but i m not sure the exit polls bear it out romney did better among voters who think economic conditions are good than among those who think it s bad _meta_end_dot_

 similarly romney did better among voters making over _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ than among voters making less than _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 he did better among college educated voters than among those without college education _meta_end_dot_

 it s true that he did best among voters who named the economy as the most important issue but the businessman candidate s main constituency seems to be among affluent business class types who aren t feeling an especially large amount of economic pain _meta_end_dot_

 more primaries and more polls should give us more data but provisionally it s not clear that economic troubles are really all that central to his appeal _meta_end_dot_
