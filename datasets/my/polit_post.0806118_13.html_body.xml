  initially john mccain had an admirably straight talking like on john hagee he was proud to be supported by the anti catholic anti muslim anti arab pro israel christian leader who hopes to see the middle east plunged into massive war that will result in the end of the world _meta_end_dot_

 now he s getting flip floppety yesterday pastor john hagee endorsed my candidacy for president in san antonio texas _meta_end_dot_

 however in no way did i intend for his endorsement to suggest that i in turn agree with all of pastor hagee s views which i obviously do not _meta_end_dot_

 i am hopeful that catholics protestants and all people of faith who share my vision for the future of america will respond to our message of defending innocent life traditional marriage and compassion for the most vulnerable in our society that s some weak tea _meta_end_dot_

 when byron dorgan endorses barack obama we take it for granted that obama doesn t agree with dorgan about every single issue out there _meta_end_dot_

 similarly when rudy giuliani endorses mccain that doesn t mean they agree about everything _meta_end_dot_

 the issue here has to do with the role of extremists in public life _meta_end_dot_

 barack obama never sought support from louis farrakhan never appeared on stage with farrakhan never pronounced himself proud to be backed by farrakhan but was nonetheless asked on national television to specifically disavow the man _meta_end_dot_

 people don t want to put a political coalition that includes farrakhan in office _meta_end_dot_

 mccain and his staff actively sought out hagee s endorsement he appeared and campaigned with hagee he said he was proud to be backed by hagee _meta_end_dot_

 hagee is in short part of mccain s political strategy _meta_end_dot_

 now he tells us he doesn t agree with hagee about everything _meta_end_dot_

 well which things _meta_end_question_

 are we supposed to believe that mccain s not into the bigotry or the foreign policy aimed at apocalypse but just likes hagee because of their shared opposition to gay marriage _meta_end_question_

 is mccain going to be courting osama bin laden s endorsement _meta_end_question_

 it s reminiscent of mccain s on again off again quest for the support of agents of intolerance like jerry falwell and pat robertson _meta_end_dot_

 mccain s trying to wink with one eye to a segment of the electorate wink with his other eye at his fans in the media and somehow maintain a reputation for straight talk throughout all this _meta_end_dot_
