  michael o hanlon gets a washington post op ed to lay out his surprising view that the surge is awesome and indeed is working so well that we can expect to start taking troops out of iraq in early _meta_number_ref_ if everything continues to be so awesome _meta_end_dot_

 in essence thanks to the super duper success of the surge all we need now is several years of additional war and for all of iraq s problems to solve themselves _meta_end_dot_

 mission accomplished _meta_end_exclamation_
