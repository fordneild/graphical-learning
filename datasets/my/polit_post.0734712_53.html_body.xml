  andrew links to this map observing it s one reason we re not leaving iraq ezra remarks that it helps explain for one thing why the middle east always dominates the foreign policy agenda it is however worth being precise about this _meta_end_dot_

 one dove s it s all about the oil complaint is another hawk s we need to keep invading these countries because our economy depends on it one observation is that the high concentration of oil in the middle east makes the region unusually war prone _meta_end_dot_

 brazilians wouldn t really gain very much from having their government conquer surinam _meta_end_dot_

 but saddam hussein or any other iraqi dictator stood to gain a lot from controlling the gulf states like kuwait saudi arabia qatar and the uae where the population is low but the oil wealth is high _meta_end_dot_

 meanwhile a country like iraq or iran that has a sizable population plus a ton of oil is in a position to build a pretty large military establishment _meta_end_dot_

 hence the gulf war era worry that if saddam was allowed to conquer kuwait he d move on into saudi arabia and the rest of the gulf thus putting together a country with truly enormous oil revenues and an enormous amount of market power _meta_end_dot_

 that s why we stepped in as leaders of an international coalition aimed at rolling back his conquest _meta_end_dot_

 at the end of the day though helping small countries resist conquest by larger countries is a perfectly sound principle to uphold _meta_end_dot_

 it s true that we might well not have been so eager to save kuwait had it not had the oil but it s also unlikely that anyone would have wanted to conquer kuwait had it not had the oil _meta_end_dot_

 meanwhile it s one thing to help small countries avoid conquest and thus try to prevent someone like saddam from gaining hegemony over the whole region _meta_end_dot_

 it s another thing to say that we should start conquering countries in order to establish our own hegemony _meta_end_dot_
