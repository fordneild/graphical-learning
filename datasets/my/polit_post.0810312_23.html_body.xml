  congestion pricing is working out great in london _meta_end_dot_

 let me add my voice to the chorus pointing out that distributive concerns are a canard in this context _meta_end_dot_

 at the moment the only jurisdictions contemplating congestion pricing are those that already feature fairly extensive public transit networks _meta_end_dot_

 in places like that lower income people are disproportionate users of public transit _meta_end_dot_

 measures that tax drivers and use the funds to boost transit service help folks at the bottom _meta_end_dot_

 one might note that congestion pricing is also good for people who really really like to drive _meta_end_dot_

 it s not after all just a fee in exchange for which drivers get nothing _meta_end_dot_

 rather the fee is the price you pay for less crowded roads _meta_end_dot_

 to some people that ll be a price that s not worth paying and they won t drive hence the reduced crowding but to others it ll be a price that is worth paying and those people should be understood as beneficiaries of the policy even though they re literally the ones paying the price _meta_end_dot_
