  there s been a bit of a discussion going on between ross douthat tyler cowen ross again john holbo and brad delong about defining conservative ideology _meta_end_dot_

 at the same time richard just did a piece recently arguing that jim webb may agree with liberals about a lot of policy issues but really he s a conservative _meta_end_dot_

 to me thinking about all this mostly reminds us that american politics isn t especially ideological and hasn t historically ever been especially ideological _meta_end_dot_

 tradition and institutional structure have given us a robust two party system _meta_end_dot_

 geography and immigration have given us an enormous extremely diverse country _meta_end_dot_

 typical democracies have many fewer people and substantially more political parties _meta_end_dot_

 consequently practical politics in the united states revolves around a competition between two political coalitions that are of necessity pretty slapdash and unwieldy _meta_end_dot_

 the primary fact about an american s political allegiance under the circumstances is his attitude toward those coalitions not his or her abstract ideas about how things ought to be _meta_end_dot_

 a conservative in this sense just is someone who supports the republican coalition versus the democratic one and who in internal debates tends to support the institutionalized conservative movement s three pillars approach against various reformist tendencies _meta_end_dot_

 this is in a lot of respects disappointing for a writer since it involves people who are interested in ideas spending a lot of our time doing gotcha stuff about how the other team is desperately in hoc to malign interests _meta_end_dot_

 but i think that if you look at our history overall you ll see that america has benefitted from having a political system that s relatively comfortable acknowledging the essentially grubby and transactional nature of real world democratic politics rather than one dominated by a lot of aspirations to purism and total victory _meta_end_dot_
