  i did a panel this afternoon with marc ross and david brooks at which brooks marc to some extent and also fred malek yes this fred malek were sort of harping on the idea that barack obama doesn t really have a mccain esque background of breaking with his party s leadership and cutting deals with those on the other side of the aisle _meta_end_dot_

 this is as best i can tell totally true obama has worked with republicans on various issues but never done anything comparable to mccain s work on say the mccain feingold bill _meta_end_dot_

 to which i more or less say shrug _meta_end_dot_

 a sign of the long era of political dominance is that to a lot of people i think the idea of a progressive democrat running and winning as a progressive democrat and going on to govern as a progressive democrat just doesn t really scan _meta_end_dot_

 if you re going to win and you re going to be a democrat then you have to be a different kind of democrat and obama sort of isn t _meta_end_dot_

 he s not the most liberal democrat in congress but then again most democrats by definition aren t on the party s leftward fringe _meta_end_dot_

 he s a pretty ordinary democrat but much more charismatic and much better at giving big speeches about why his ideas are awesome _meta_end_dot_

 and while he might lose the election i and everyone else think he ll probably win _meta_end_dot_
