  ta nehisi the news that virginia has performed it s first execution in two years got me thinking about a topic that seemingly fallen off the radar this season criminal justice reform _meta_end_dot_

 the death penalty sadly seems here to stay _meta_end_dot_

 but one of the reasons i so emphatically fell for jim webb before kathy took him apart was because in addition to being outspoken about veterans issues he s probably the most prominent senator i ve heard speak on reforming our prisons _meta_end_dot_

 i could be wrong on that and would love to be corrected _meta_end_dot_

 that said i have heard very little about this issue out on the campaign trail _meta_end_dot_

 frankly this is as it should be you don t win elections by talking about shortening the sentences of criminals _meta_end_dot_

 still i hope this issue is a priority should obama win _meta_end_dot_

 indeed to me one of the promises of an obama administration would be that he could hopefully deracialize certain issues that really occur to me as matters of basic fairness and justice _meta_end_dot_

 heather macdonald has had a field day dismantling those who claim that the criminal justice is racist _meta_end_dot_

 but i think that s a strawman _meta_end_dot_

 frankly i don t much care about whether the law was intended to hurt black people nor do i care whether it s called racist or not _meta_end_dot_

 to the extent that the racist label is a distraction it should be jettisoned _meta_end_dot_

 it seems like the real question should be does our drug policy make sense _meta_end_question_

 are we helping or hurting the situation in our inner cities _meta_end_question_
