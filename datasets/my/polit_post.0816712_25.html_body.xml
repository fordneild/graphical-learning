  i got to request to say something about hannah rosin s article on the memphis crime experience _meta_end_dot_

 i don t have a ton to say about it other than that you should read the article since i think the article itself says about everything i would want to say _meta_end_dot_

 but to give it a brief gloss people hoped that tearing down public housing towers and replacing them with section _meta_number_ref_ vouchers would by dispersing the people on public assistance help mitigate the social pathologies associated with poverty by breaking up pockets of poverty in fact as rosin reports dispersing impoverished people mostly seems to have dispersed rather than dispelled the crime problems associated with pockets of poverty _meta_end_dot_

 i m not _meta_number_ref_ percent sure where that leaves us _meta_end_dot_

 housing vouchers still seem like a better idea than the projects for various reasons related to economic efficiency and choice _meta_end_dot_

 and as far as crime goes we seem to mostly still know what we know higher wages for low skill workers higher educational attainment the presence of more police officers patrolling the street throwing enormous quantities of young men in prison fewer drug addicts and reductions in the amount of lead poisoning all seem to lower crime _meta_end_dot_
