  today s washington post editorial on iraq has a very definite pravda vibe to it sure we all saw watched and heard the iraqi government repeatedly endorse an iraq strategy along the lines of what barack obama has proposed and repeatedly reject an iraq strategy along the lines of the bush mccain perpetual war for perpetual occupation strategy but here comes fred hiatt to tell us that s not what happened at all _meta_end_dot_

 the logic chopping and mixed up facts are stunning but no more so than the post s bold declaration that fighting al qaeda is a less important national security priority than is military occupation of iraqi oil fields mr _meta_end_dot_

 obama s response is that as president he would have to weigh iraq s needs against those of afghanistan and the u s _meta_end_dot_

 economy while the united states has an interest in preventing the resurgence of the afghan taliban the country s strategic importance pales beside that of iraq which lies at the geopolitical center of the middle east and contains some of the world s largest oil reserves _meta_end_dot_

 it s important to be clear about what s at stake when it comes to iraqi oil _meta_end_dot_

 lots of oil is already under the control of hostile iran venezuela or not especially friendly russia governments _meta_end_dot_

 but that doesn t deprive american consumers of oil _meta_end_dot_

 nor does it make oil more expensive _meta_end_dot_

 the saudis and the norwegians don t sell us discount oil _meta_end_dot_

 there s a global market and a global price _meta_end_dot_

 the american consumer filling up his tank doesn t see a difference if the oil s from mexico or equatorial guinea or kuwait doesn t see a difference if the oil s owned by totalfinaelf or exxonmobil or citgo _meta_end_dot_

 war for oil doesn t mean cheap oil for you _meta_end_dot_

 what it does mean is protection for companies that have invested in iraqi oil _meta_end_dot_

 those fields could be a good investment _meta_end_dot_

 but there s a lot of political risk and insofar as iraq is playing host to a large occupying military force and has a government that s dependent on that military force to stay in power that political risk is mitigated _meta_end_dot_

 which is great if you have a contract to drill for iraqi oil but really stinks as a national security priority for the united states and it s bad for the economy to boot _meta_end_dot_

 certainly i wouldn t say that it s more important than taking the fight to al qaeda the taliban and osama bin laden _meta_end_dot_
