  since i last checked on developments in iraq it seems that turkey s invaded and folks aren t so happy about it in baghdad the iraqi government demanded that turkish forces withdraw from northern iraq where they have been fighting kurdish guerrillas who use the area as a base to mount attacks in turkey _meta_end_dot_

 government spokesman ali al dabbagh said iraq s cabinet condemned the incursion and called it a violation of iraq s sovereignty the cabinet calls on turkey to withdraw its troops immediately and stop the military interventions and stresses that the military action by one side is unacceptable and threatens the good relations between the two neighboring countries dabbagh said _meta_end_dot_

 but of course these protests are going to be ineffectual _meta_end_dot_

 given the iraqi government s dependence on the u s _meta_end_dot_

 military a turkish invasion of iraq that the united states approves of isn t something the iraqi government can or will do anything about _meta_end_dot_

 thus this incident becomes one more case where u s supported iraqi leaders see their credibility as national leaders leeched away _meta_end_dot_

 if you think of the goal in iraq as helping to prop up a government that ll be able to stand up on its own this sort of thing is a disaster _meta_end_dot_

 if by contrast the idea is to ensure that the authorities governing iraq are permanently dependent on external american support to maintain their grip on power it s actually pretty good _meta_end_dot_

 but once again it all comes down to a question of what do you think the right strategic priority are for the united states not to any question as simplistic as whether or not green lighting a turkish invasion of northern iraq is working
