  responding to increasing indications that john mccain is looking seriously at mitt romney as a vp choice noam scheiber rounds up the evidence that romney doesn t exactly have huge appeal to swing voters _meta_end_dot_

 stepping back though before mccain does this i would urge him to recall what happened back in the primaries _meta_end_dot_

 romney had a lot of advantages solid conservative positions on the issues a lot of institutional support and a ton of money _meta_end_dot_

 but he wound up losing because basically people find him loathesome _meta_end_dot_

 some find him loathesome because of his religion some because of his flip flopping and others just because he s loathesome _meta_end_dot_

 but whatever the reason people just really don t like mitt romney _meta_end_dot_

 putting him on the ticket seems like an obvious recipe for disaster but a potential boon to progressive bloggers who are really in need of a mockable choice _meta_end_dot_
