  these are the latest youth cohort party id numbers from pew _meta_end_dot_

 as you can see here the future looks a bit bleak for the gop _meta_end_dot_

 the chart illustrates the fact that contrary to myth the democratic edge with young people has usually been pretty small but now it s huge _meta_end_dot_

 in a micro sense of course anyone whose experience consists mostly of eight years of peace and prosperity under bill clinton followed by bush acceding to the white house under dubious circumstances and then leading us into inept governance failed wars and a shaky economy is bound to favor the democrats _meta_end_dot_

 but in a macro sense you re looking at the undertow of the past thirty years of conservative identity politics _meta_end_dot_

 the right has had great electoral success mobilizing people against the kind of social transformation we ve been experiencing for the past several decades more and more assertive racial and ethnic minorities secularists cosmopolitan types etc but they haven t actually halted any of these transformations and the lines of cleavage that have given the gop the bigger half of the cookie in most elections since _meta_number_ref_ leave them with the smaller half among the youngest cohort _meta_end_dot_
