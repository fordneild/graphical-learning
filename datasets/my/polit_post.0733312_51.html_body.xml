  ben smith at politico broke the story of how rudy giuliani billed obscure city agencies for tens of thousands of dollars in security expenses amassed during the time when he was beginning an extramarital relationship with future wife judith nathan in the hamptons according to previously undisclosed government records but it took the more tabloid flavor of the new york daily news to give us the image above _meta_end_dot_

 they also situate the scoop nicely it has been known since _meta_number_ref_ that then mayor giuliani used his official taxpayer funded nypd detail to escort him to weekend getaways at nathan s southampton condo as early as _meta_number_ref_ well before his marriage to donna hanover dissolved the following spring _meta_end_dot_

 back then the giuliani administration stonewalled reporters trying to nail down the costs for guarding the mayor during his nathan liaison _meta_end_dot_

 the full tab remains a city secret _meta_end_dot_

 but the documents obtained by the politico com web site through freedom of information laws now show for the first time how giuliani s administration seemed to scatter travel costs for security details during that time among obscure mayoral offices _meta_end_dot_

 looks like it s time to say _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ some more _meta_end_dot_

 i m sure it s relevant somehow _meta_end_dot_

 speaking of which in the construction of the giuliani _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ mythos part of what s gone missing is the large role that george w _meta_end_dot_

 bush played in setting the stage for rudy s heroics by so utterly failing to perform his head of state functions properly in a moment of crisis _meta_end_dot_

 that day people were really freaked out since after all nobody was quite sure what had happened and the president of the united states spent the bulk of the day running and hiding or something and then that evening delivered a terrible speech _meta_end_dot_

 under the circumstances giuliani s composed performance felt very reassuring _meta_end_dot_

 but it was only a big deal because bush was so inept a better response from him and there would have been no america s mayor
