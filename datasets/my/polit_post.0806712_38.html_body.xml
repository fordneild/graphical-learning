  katha pollitt does a great response essay to charlotte allen s women are dumb op ed _meta_end_dot_

 i even learned a thing or two about traffic safety allen claims that the misogynist canard is true thanks to their superior visuospatial abilities men although maybe not gay men are better drivers with _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ accidents per million miles compared to women s _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 the only good news she adds is that because they take fewer risks women s accidents are only a third as likely to be fatal _meta_end_dot_

 that s a very interesting definition of ability behind the wheel the better drivers are the ones who take more risks and are three times as likely to end up dead _meta_end_dot_

 men like risky behavior leading to more accident fatalities jibes with my general understanding but i wonder why women get into more aggregate accidents _meta_end_dot_

 you d think that the same skills and instincts that help you avoid a fatal crash would also help you avoid a minor one _meta_end_dot_
