  there s this condo under construction a little ways from my house _meta_end_dot_

 one afternoon i stopped by the sales office curious as to what the units were selling for _meta_end_dot_

 long story short more than they were worth _meta_end_dot_

 but they finagled my email address out of me in exchange for some refreshments _meta_end_dot_

 so now i get this all caps email from them yesterday save the date thursday december _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ pm refreshments will be served final release year end sales event and you re invited _meta_end_exclamation_

 great units with balconies and views that rock have been released _meta_end_exclamation_

 if you visited our sales center in the past and the unit you wanted was sold then this is your chance _meta_end_exclamation_

 we ve targeted _meta_number_ref_ more sales by year end for this exciting property and have five to go to reach our goal we re offering special incentives through _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ talk about a win win we hit our sales target of _meta_number_ref_ new contracts by year end and you get a great deal on a spectacular condo _meta_end_exclamation_

 this all kind of smacks of desperation eh _meta_end_question_

 meanwhile i hadn t realized you could unbuy a condo you d already bought from a developer but the only sense i can make out of the claim that if you visited our sales center in the past and the unit you wanted was sold then this is your chance is that people have done just that _meta_end_dot_

 my understanding of the data is that central city areas have been weathering the shitpile s collapse much better than have the fringes basically when prices fall the demand pattern collapses inward toward the center and its people who owned in the rim who are really left holding the bag but it s hard for new developments everywhere especially ones like this one that are too far along to convert into rentals _meta_end_dot_

 either way there s no call for this much capitalization _meta_end_dot_
