  spencer ackerman thinks he knows what ultimate blogs masterworks from the wild web a new anthology from the new york times s sarah boxer is all about but he hasn t even read it yet _meta_end_dot_

 the fact of the matter is that my origin story is tweaked but only slightly _meta_end_dot_

 the major difference in the ultimate yglesias continuity concerns my rogue s gallery _meta_end_dot_

 ultimate jonah goldberg for example isn t a nepotism hire at all but rather a _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ mile long swarm of robotic drones that threatens to destroy all life on earth _meta_end_dot_

 it s true to the spirit of the original but also a pretty bold re imagining that keeps things interesting even for old time fans _meta_end_dot_
