  it s fascinating how unhinged a lot of the reactions to obama s speech are over at the corner _meta_end_dot_

 here s charlotte hays just flat out denying that it makes sense to try to understand things in context obama says that we shouldn t condemn without understanding the roots of remarks like those wright made _meta_end_dot_

 whatever the roots these remarks are to be condemned _meta_end_dot_

 within what context is it correct for the rev _meta_end_dot_

 wright to say god damn america there s some kind of reading comprehension problem here if hays can t see that obama s not saying it was correct of wright to say that _meta_end_dot_

 roger clegg sees the speech as politics as usual which makes me think he must have been watching a very different usual politics from me up until now _meta_end_dot_

 k lo says any hopes anyone had that barack obama would be a gift to civil rights in america that he would shake hands with ward connerly and really be a change died today i think in the speech john derbyshire heard blame whitey and raise high the red flag of socialism was the essence of obama s message _meta_end_dot_
