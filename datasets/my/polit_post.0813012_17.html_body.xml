  paying some ridiculously large sum of money to mike d antoni does seem like the kind of expensive won t work quick fix that would appeal to the new york knicks management so i kind of hope that happens _meta_end_dot_

 remember when larry brown was going to cure what ails the team _meta_end_question_

 well that didn t work and helping a listing team learn how to play defense is the sort of thing brown has done well in the past _meta_end_dot_

 d antoni s a good coach in my view but what the knicks really need to do is focus on the fact that their roster doesn t have enough good players _meta_end_dot_

 absent canny draft choices good free agent signings or a lucky trade the team is just bound to be terrible _meta_end_dot_

 under the circumstances they may as well save money and hire a caretaker coach while trying to rebuild the team _meta_end_dot_
