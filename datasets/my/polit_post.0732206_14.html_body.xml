  this seems like a weird topic for an op ed but the factoids are interesting the facts about smoking and mental illness are stark _meta_end_dot_

 almost half of all cigarettes sold in the united states _meta_number_ref_ percent are consumed by people with mental illness _meta_end_dot_

 this is because so many people who have mental illnesses smoke _meta_number_ref_ to _meta_number_ref_ percent compared with less than _meta_number_ref_ percent of the general population and because they smoke so many cigarettes a day often three packs _meta_end_dot_

 furthermore smokers with mental illness are much more likely to smoke their cigarettes right down to the filters _meta_end_dot_

 i d like to see this demographic analysis drill down deeper _meta_end_dot_

 i imagine the mentally ill population differs from the general population in various ways that may correlate with an increased propensity to smoke _meta_end_dot_
