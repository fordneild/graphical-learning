  via ezra klein george packer gets into my favorite hobby of wondering why comparing someone to jfk is supposed to me a good thing j f k _meta_end_dot_

 was a mediocre president _meta_end_dot_

 for two and a half years his position on civil rights was legalistic he stood up for enforcing court orders until the dramatic images from birmingham in may _meta_number_ref_ forced him to describe the issue as a moral one _meta_end_dot_

 the civil rights bill he then introduced into congress stood little chance of passing partly because kennedy was unwilling to spend the huge amount of necessary political capital _meta_end_dot_

 for those who believe he was on his way out of vietnam when he was assassinated how to explain the dramatic coup three weeks before his death that overthrew the government of ngo dinh diem and pulled the u s _meta_end_dot_

 ever deeper into the quagmire _meta_end_question_

 kennedy s main domestic accomplishment was a tax cut his main foreign accomplishment was avoiding nuclear war over soviet missiles in cuba his finest hour _meta_end_dot_

 all i d observe is that it s actually common for invocations of the heroes of the past to be someone vacuous _meta_end_dot_

 fdr praising liberals typically don t have the details of the new deal legislative program in mind or any particular inclination to reinstitute something like the national industrial recovery act _meta_end_dot_

 similarly it s been noted ad nauseam that the historical ronald reagan doesn t greatly resemble the reagan myth the right has constructed _meta_end_dot_

 at the end of the day there s probably not much point in worrying too much about the strict accuracy of our comparisons _meta_end_dot_
