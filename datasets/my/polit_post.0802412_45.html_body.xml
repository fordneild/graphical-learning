  this kind of thing is one reason i m glad he s still in the race in washington today telecom lobbyists have launched a full court press to win retroactive immunity for their illegal eavesdropping on american citizens _meta_end_dot_

 granting retroactive immunity will let corporate law breakers off the hook and hamstring efforts to learn the truth about bush s illegal spying program _meta_end_dot_

 it s time for senate democrats to show a little backbone and stand up to george w _meta_end_dot_

 bush and the corporate lobbyists _meta_end_dot_

 they should do everything in their power including joining senator dodd s efforts to filibuster this legislation to stop retroactive immunity _meta_end_dot_

 the constitution should not be for sale at any price _meta_end_dot_

 i ll add that i think edwards is right to see as largely an issue of corporate lobbyists with the democrats using their habitual spinelessness on national security issues as a pretext for the more tawdry business of simply handing out favors to telecom companies _meta_end_dot_

 but if the congress an opposition party led congress responding to a discovery that pierced a years long executive branch coverup accepts this it s not a crime if the president asks you to do it theory of legal liability we may as well not have any laws at all _meta_end_dot_

 meanwhile i wonder what happened to edwards _meta_number_ref_ vintage enthusiasm for creating a domestic intelligence agency
