  i think obama s speech was pretty brilliant if a bit long _meta_end_dot_

 of course at the end of the day the formal speech is the area of politics in which he most excels so channelling the jeremiah wright controversy into a major speech on race was a savvy move _meta_end_dot_

 i think this was the most significant part in fact a similar anger exists within segments of the white community _meta_end_dot_

 most working and middle class white americans don t feel that they have been particularly privileged by their race _meta_end_dot_

 their experience is the immigrant experience as far as they re concerned no one s handed them anything they ve built it from scratch _meta_end_dot_

 they ve worked hard all their lives many times only to see their jobs shipped overseas or their pension dumped after a lifetime of labor _meta_end_dot_

 they are anxious about their futures and feel their dreams slipping away in an era of stagnant wages and global competition opportunity comes to be seen as a zero sum game in which your dreams come at my expense _meta_end_dot_

 so when they are told to bus their children to a school across town when they hear that an african american is getting an advantage in landing a good job or a spot in a good college because of an injustice that they themselves never committed when they re told that their fears about crime in urban neighborhoods are somehow prejudiced resentment builds over time _meta_end_dot_

 the kind of white resentment obama is talking about here has been a problem for the democratic party for decades now notwithstanding the fact that you rarely see the party nominating african americans to run in majority white constituencies _meta_end_dot_

 what obama is showing us here is that precisely because he s black he s able to acknowledge and validate these resentments in a way that would be very difficult for a white liberal politician _meta_end_dot_

 at any rate i d say things are back on track _meta_end_dot_

 the wright business had opened up a vague sliver of hope for hillary clinton s campaign if they could produce a result in pennsylvania that looked like a wright induced collapse in obama s white support maybe they could convince superdelegates that he s unelectable _meta_end_dot_

 after this speech i don t see it happening _meta_end_dot_
