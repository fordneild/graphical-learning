  i was telling friends while playing poker yesterday that i had a brilliant plan to break new ground in the obama analysis sweepstakes he s not the liberal reagan i was going to say he s the american pierre trudeau shockingly though the weekly standard actually beat me to the punch on this _meta_end_dot_

 of course they see it as a bad thing whereas i meant it in a good way _meta_end_dot_

 note that trudeau is the dominant figure of _meta_number_ref_th century canada governing the country almost unbroken from _meta_number_ref_ to _meta_number_ref_ so whatever the standard may tell you about the problems with the trudeau era the reality is that canadians liked him fine _meta_end_dot_

 the subtext here of course is that post trudeau canada is so inhospital to right wingery that canada s best and brightest conservative pundits have had to migrate south to ply their trade where folks like david frum and charles krauthammer have become leading lights of the current wave of neoconservative thinking _meta_end_dot_

 naturally they fear and loathe obama much as their comrades in arms up north feared and loathed trudeau _meta_end_dot_
