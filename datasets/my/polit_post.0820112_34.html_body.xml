  u s _meta_end_dot_

 presidential candidate barack obama talks about _meta_number_ref_ months _meta_end_dot_

 that we think would be the right timeframe for a withdrawal with the possibility of slight changes _meta_end_dot_

 it s unremarkable on its own terms for someone to tell a periodical that they think barack obama is basically right about iraq but in this case the person talking is iraqi prime minister nouri al maliki being interviewed by der spiegel so that seems pretty noteworthy _meta_end_dot_

 we shouldn t slavishly adhere to whatever the iraqi government happens to want if they say we need _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ soldiers in iraq for the next _meta_number_ref_ years we need to tell them no way but as even john mccain and george bush used to admit if the iraqis want us to leave we really have to leave _meta_end_dot_

 maliki here and for the past couple of weeks more broadly is addressing himself to the most fundamental facts on the ground in iraq of all the gross unpopularity of the american military presence _meta_end_dot_

 under those circumstances only real desperation such as the terrible situation prevailing in _meta_number_ref_ makes it make sense for maliki to uncritically endorse an open ended presence _meta_end_dot_

 whatever it is he would like to get from us forces and you ve got to believe it s plenty given that plenty of security issues still exist for iraq the larger imperative is to get it in the context of also getting a plan to get iraq s sovereignty back _meta_end_dot_
