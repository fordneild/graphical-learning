  robert farley wonders why isn t mitt romney being treated as the overwhelming frontrunner in the republican race _meta_end_question_

 he s won two of the four contests so far and placed second twice _meta_end_dot_

 moreover michigan differs from the other three contests in that it s inhabited by actual people twice as many as the other three states combined _meta_end_dot_

 he s also the leader in total money and trails only minor also ran candidate rudy giuliani in cash on hand all true _meta_end_dot_

 what s more as you ll see in the chart overhead he actually has a narrow majority in terms of delegates allocated _meta_end_dot_

 the republican race is by no means over but romney unmistakably has the lead _meta_end_dot_

 what s more romney seems to me to have the advantage of internal lines in the three way huckabee mccain romney battle _meta_end_dot_

 mccain s big hope was to knock romney out of the race or more precisely to have mike huckabee knock romney out of the race in order to become the establishment candidate with maverick cred _meta_end_dot_

 but having added a solid win in michigan to his wyoming pickup romney is a clearly a viable candidate for the establishment to back and mccain is back to being a guy who republicans don t really like _meta_end_dot_
