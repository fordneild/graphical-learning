  there s a piece up on hoopsworld arguing that the denver nuggets have a ton of talent but can t break into the elite because of a pick up game mentality _meta_end_dot_

 i m not so sure _meta_end_dot_

 one piece of alleged evidence in favor of this is the idea that denver puts forth a poor overall defensive effort but according to basketball reference their defense is seventh in the league _meta_end_dot_

 that s pretty good _meta_end_dot_

 certainly it s better than their offense which is only thirteenth in the league _meta_end_dot_

 i think people misunderstand denver because once again of the pace illusion _meta_end_dot_

 denver plays at the highest pace in the league so if you look at points per game their offense looks better than it is and their defense looks worse than it is _meta_end_dot_

 the fact of the matter however is that despite the fact that allen iverson and carmelo anthony are both alleged to be elite superstar scorers their offense is distinctly mediocre because neither of them are actually very efficient scorers _meta_end_dot_
