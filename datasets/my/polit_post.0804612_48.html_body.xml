  steve clemons and my colleague josh green both insist that as per common sense patti solis doyle was fired from her spot as hillary clinton s campaign manager _meta_end_dot_

 it seems however that yesterday the clinton campaign put out some more details on the stepped down theory ms _meta_end_dot_

 solis doyle recently returned home after two months on the road to find a family accustomed to her absence she told colleagues _meta_end_dot_

 when her _meta_number_ref_ year old son cried out one night recently he rebuffed his mom saying i want daddy ms _meta_end_dot_

 solis doyle flew out of the room in tears and told her husband joey doesn t want me _meta_end_dot_

 s this campaign i m quitting this is probably something every parent of young children could sympathize with but at the same time it almost seems calculated to send the message that you can t put mothers in positions of responsibility doesn t it _meta_end_question_

 after all if it s really true that solis doyle wasn t fired then quitting a top job in the clinton campaign at a moment of crisis would have been an incredibly irresponsible thing to do _meta_end_dot_

 in the real world of course it doesn t make any sense as anything other than a firing but inside the fiction solis doyle just switched from a campaign manager who arguably made some mistakes to being a campaign manager who really screwed over her boss and all her employees and millions of clinton supporters across the country _meta_end_dot_
