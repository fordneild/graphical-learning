  house democrats believe they have a decent shot at endangering the seats of a troika of south florida cuban american republicans lincoln diaz balart his brother mario and the evil ileana ros lehtinen _meta_end_dot_

 but one problem _meta_end_dot_

 representative debbie wasserman shultz a florida democrat who co chairs the red to blue program aimed at picking up seats won t get involved because she s pals with the republicans in question _meta_end_dot_

 which is nice for her but obviously the role of someone in her position is to try to beat republican incumbents not protect them _meta_end_dot_

 to be fair though it s not just personal ties that bring all these hyphenated floridians together it s also a passion for continuing decades old foreign policy failures wasserman schultz has also played a leading role in persuading the new democratic majority to sustain the economic embargo against cuba and has established close ties to the staunchly pro embargo u s cuba democracy political action committee which has contributed thousands to wasserman schultz and meek s campaigns _meta_end_dot_

 after all the first fifty years of the embargo have done wonders for cuban democracy so just give it another _meta_number_ref_ or so democracy will break out and then tourists can visit havana in flying cars _meta_end_dot_

 i don t see anything wrong with that _meta_end_dot_
