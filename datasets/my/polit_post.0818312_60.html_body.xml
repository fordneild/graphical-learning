  jessy tolkan from the energy action coalition opened a climate change session with a brief kind of pep talk urging people correctly in my view that rather than try to unite the country around a sense of crisis and doom we need to try to unite people around an appealing vision of green jobs clean energy etc _meta_end_dot_

 to me this is completely right _meta_end_dot_

 next up was dr _meta_end_dot_

 john holdren of harvard and woods hole who opened by remarking that he had little in the way of optimism or good news to report noting that things have actually changed faster than people predicted and that we re now at a point where substantial climate change is inevitable and the issue is how much can we adapt and can we avoid absolute disaster _meta_end_dot_
