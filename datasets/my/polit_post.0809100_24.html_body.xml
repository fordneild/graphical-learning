  as best i can tell nobody s quite sure what s happening _meta_end_dot_

 sadr offered a cease fire and a government spokesman kinda sorta appeared to accept the terms but the fighting continues and it remains a bit unclear who s in control of which forces or what this is even about _meta_end_dot_

 what seems certain though is that maliki badly miscalculated his ability to crush sadr and is prepared for some kind of climbdown far short of his initial demands _meta_end_dot_
