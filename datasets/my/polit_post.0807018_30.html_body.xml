  as i ve previously recommended matt miller s atlantic article first kill all the school boards i feel i should also note the longer version of his argument nationalize the schools a little for the center for american progress _meta_end_dot_

 it s mostly the same stuff but at greater length and in the dry wonky form we expect from a think tank sponsored pdf _meta_end_dot_

 that said he s correct _meta_end_dot_

 in a large and diverse country there s a case for some level of local control _meta_end_dot_

 but fundamentally most of what a kid in new mexico needs to know is the same as what a kid in north dakota or vermont or virginia needs to know and intense localization creates tons and tons of problems for no real reason other than blind tradition _meta_end_dot_
