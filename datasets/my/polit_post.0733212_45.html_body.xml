  chad ford s preview of the _meta_number_ref_ free agent class is subscriber only but there s no need to read it since the only part that matters is here but given current projections only one team the philadelphia _meta_number_ref_ers will have enough money under the cap to spend on them _meta_end_dot_

 even the sixers won t have max room if a they have a large cap hold for a high first round pick and b they decide to give iguodala and louis williams both restricted free agents big deals this summer so basically nothing s going to happen _meta_end_dot_

 there are a bunch of stars who could opt out of contracts and sign elsewhere but nobody can pay them so they ll all get contract extensions instead _meta_end_dot_
