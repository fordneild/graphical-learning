  tech policy journalist drew clark says the new york times missed part of the story of john mccain s close ties to bud paxson and paxson communications after a brief period of democratic dominance mccain returned to become chairman of the committee in _meta_number_ref_ and _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 during that period he took crucial legislative action that saved paxson communications from a bill that would have in the words of ceo lowell bud paxson finally ruined his company _meta_end_dot_

 even more ironically mccain took this action for paxson in spite of his long standing position that television broadcasters had inappropriately used the transition to digital television dtv to benefit themselves financially at the expense of the american public _meta_end_dot_

 mccain initially supported legislation that would have forced paxson and handful of broadcasters but not the great bulk of television stations off the air by december _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 bud paxson himself personally testified about this bill with fear and trepidation at a hearing on september _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 two weeks later mccain had reversed himself _meta_end_dot_

 he now supported legislation that would grant two year reprieve for paxson and instead force all broadcasters to stop transmitting analog television by december _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 paxson and his lobbyists including iseman were working at this time for just such a change _meta_end_dot_

 this looks like a basic bush style policy for sale kind of situation a far cry from mccain s self righteous insistence that he s never done favors for lobbyists or special interests but also something rather different from the sex scandal the new york times kinda sorta wants you to believe in _meta_end_dot_
