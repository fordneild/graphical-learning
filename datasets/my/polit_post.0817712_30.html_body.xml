  quite an ad from gordon smith you d never know this guy was the republican candidate as opposed to maybe someone running on a democrat green fusion ticket or something _meta_end_dot_

 bill burton put out a statement for the obama campaign saying barack obama has a long record of bipartisan accomplishment and we appreciate that it is respected by his democratic and republican colleagues in the senate _meta_end_dot_

 but in this race oregonians should know that barack obama supports jeff merkley for senate _meta_end_dot_

 merkley will help obama bring about the fundamental change we need in washington
