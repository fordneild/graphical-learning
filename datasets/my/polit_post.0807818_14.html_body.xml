  someone in comments asked me what in light of my enthusiasm for congestion pricing i thought about this long washington post profile of tyler duvall a toll enthusiast and bush administration dot official _meta_end_dot_

 mostly i think what ryan avent thinks namely that what you want is congestion pricing and investment in mass transit after all you have to give people some way to get around not the duvall synthesis of toll roads and blocking transit projects willy nilly _meta_end_dot_

 combine his anti transit views with his enthusiasm for road privatization and this sounds more like a fairly typical for the bush administration case of an agency being run for the sake of the private firms it does business with than it does like a visionary new approach to transportation policy _meta_end_dot_
