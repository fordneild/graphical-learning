  spencer ackerman posted a powerful email from a junior officer currently serving in iraq _meta_end_dot_

 i ll just nab an excerpt in my opinion what everyone fails to realize is that this is not a counterinsurgency _meta_end_dot_

 if we wanted to stay in iraq then it would be a counterinsurgency _meta_end_dot_

 but it is clear that our goal is to turn over power and pull out _meta_end_dot_

 so in building our strategic endstate it s pointless to set goals that relate to our presence in iraq _meta_end_dot_

 if the insurgency is a function of our being there then it is not an insurgency in terms of our endstate _meta_end_dot_

 for example if one of our goals is to stop ied attacks on us forces that is pointless _meta_end_dot_

 when we leave there will be no more ied attacks on us forces _meta_end_dot_

 so our endstate needs to be different _meta_end_dot_

 we need to ask if we left tomorrow what would happen in iraq and from there we need to determine which of those anticipated results are unacceptable to us _meta_end_dot_

 then we must aim our efforts on making sure those unacceptable results do not occur _meta_end_dot_

 when i look at the problem that way it becomes almost impossible to find a purpose in what we do _meta_end_dot_

 this is correct but of course the policymakers in washington some time ago shifted to a crazy equilibrium where continuing the war became the war s own rationale _meta_end_dot_

 initially we invaded to depose saddam and destroy his wmd programs _meta_end_dot_

 so when at first the programs weren t there we had to keep some troops in the country to look for them _meta_end_dot_

 what s more some kind of new government had to be created _meta_end_dot_

 but then contrary to what the bush administration had expected an insurgency started against our presence _meta_end_dot_

 the insurgents were killing our troops _meta_end_dot_

 then beating the insurgents became the goal _meta_end_dot_

 our troops had to stay in iraq and risk their lives in order to kill the people who were trying to kill them to force them out of iraq we couldn t leave until all the people who wanted us to leave were dead _meta_end_dot_

 from that point the quality of the strategic thinking involved has only declined _meta_end_dot_

 john mccain s supporters get very upset if you suggest he wants the war in iraq to continue for _meta_number_ref_ years _meta_end_dot_

 after all he stipulated that first the war would end and then _meta_number_ref_ years of u s _meta_end_dot_

 troops running around iraq peacefully would begin _meta_end_dot_

 what this misses is that the u s _meta_end_dot_

 presence is one of the main issues at stake in the war _meta_end_dot_

 it s not that peace would suddenly break out if we left but peace is certain to never break out as long as we stay _meta_end_dot_

 counterinsurgency requires among other things political conciliation and conciliation requires us to leave but the hawks logic requires us to stay and fight for the right to keep staying and fighting _meta_end_dot_
