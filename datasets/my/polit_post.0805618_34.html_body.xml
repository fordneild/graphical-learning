  spencer ackerman flags a shmuel rosner article on samantha power in which she responds to allegations that she hates jews etc etc _meta_end_dot_

 the article s not terrible but anything that refers to noah pollack who s been peddling these smears as a yound and talented writer is bound to be at least somewhat problematic _meta_end_dot_

 to make a long story short though first obama was an anti semite because zbigniew brzezinski is an anti semite _meta_end_dot_

 then obama was an anti semite because robert malley is an anti semite _meta_end_dot_

 and now according to pollack it s power who who s tainted by jew hatred _meta_end_dot_

 in part you re just seeing tawdry political smears against a popular and charismatic progressive politician _meta_end_dot_

 but in large part we re just seeing episode _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ of one of the longest running shows in the u s _meta_end_dot_

 foreign policy debate in which nobody is allowed to say that any israeli actions have caused anyone to suffer have been responsible for any problems for the united states have in any way contributed to the inability to reach a peaceful settlement of the conflict etc _meta_end_dot_

 it d be nice to see the obama campaign actually punch back on this kind of thing _meta_end_dot_

 to note that if commentary s out to get you it s probably because you re doing something right _meta_end_dot_

 something like perhaps dissenting from the maniacal commentary worldview that s done so little over the past seven years to make the united states or israel more secure _meta_end_dot_

 instead they re kind of slinking away apologetically lest they offend the broad middle of american and jewish opinion on israel which certainly wants the u s _meta_end_dot_

 to take a pro israel posture but certainly doesn t define that posture in a commentary ish way as involving a limitless commitment to securing west bank settlements and avoiding diplomatic engagement with syria and iran _meta_end_dot_

 it s a pretty a disappointing lack of vision on obama s part though i m hardly seeing a better alternative _meta_end_dot_
