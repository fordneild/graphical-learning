  isaac in this week s times literary supplement the usually engaging niall ferguson has a long review of a new generally sympathetic henry kissinger biography _meta_end_dot_

 in addition to recommending the book which despite a few questionable assertions appears to have some interesting stuff on kissinger s childhood ferguson poses his review around the following question has the ferocity of the criticism which kissinger has attracted perhaps got something to do with the fact that he like the rothschilds is jewish _meta_end_question_

 before returning to this particular topic it s worth mentioning a few things about the rest of ferguson s piece _meta_end_dot_

 it s a vigorous defense of kissinger and also a critique of kissinger s critics among them seymour hersh and christopher hitchens _meta_end_dot_

 ferguson starts off very shakily with a notably weak plea for leniency it would in fact be much easier to implicate a number of kissinger s predecessors in civilian bombings coups d tat and support for murderous regimes _meta_end_dot_

 unlike the case of chile to give a single example there is no question that the central intelligence agency had a direct hand in the coup that overthrew an elected government in guatemala in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 it also played an active role in the subsequent campaign of violence against the guatemalan left _meta_end_dot_

 many more people around _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ died in this campaign than were disappeared in chile after _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 in any case richard nixon was not the first president to seek to influence chilean domestic politics _meta_end_dot_

 both of his immediate predecessors did so _meta_end_dot_

 yet you will search the bookshops in vain for the trial of john foster dulles or the trial of dean rusk _meta_end_dot_

 there are two responses to this _meta_end_dot_

 the first is that it is not a ringing defense of the former secretary of state only _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ people killed under pinochet _meta_end_dot_

 and the second is that if someone did write a book about guatemala called the trial of john foster dulles you can be absolutely sure that niall ferguson would be the first person to accuse the author of hyperventilating and reducing a complicated period in american history to a na ve and simplistic bill of wrongs _meta_end_dot_

 ferguson s defense of kissinger s coziness with other third world despots is not much more convincing in order to check soviet ambitions in the third world the full extent of which we have only recently come to appreciate some unpleasant regimes had to be tolerated and indeed supported _meta_end_dot_

 besides the various latin american caudillos the saudi royal family the shah of iran and the pakistani military these unpleasant regimes also included though the left seldom acknowledged it the maoist regime in beijing which was already guilty of many more violations of human rights than all the right wing dictators put together when kissinger flew there for the first time in july _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 keep in mind that this paragraph comes directly after one praising the china opening something he discusses without acknowledging that it was done through pakistani back channels while the pakistani army was with kissinger s approval committing genocide in bangladesh _meta_end_dot_

 still even with recent revelations about soviet policy in the third world is ferguson really prepared to argue that we had to tolerate and support the pakistani dictatorship and the saudi royal family to the extent that we did _meta_end_question_

 note too that ferguson chooses not to mention nixon kissinger policy in indonesia and cyprus _meta_end_dot_

 then there is this yet the real revolution kissinger had to achieve was not so much in the realm of grand strategy as in that of domestic politics _meta_end_dot_

 as he himself put it in one of the many heartland speeches he delivered in the us in _meta_number_ref_ and _meta_number_ref_ his underlying aim was to end the self flagellation that has done so much harm to this nation s capacity to conduct foreign policy _meta_end_dot_

 in this he was ultimately unsuccessful _meta_end_dot_

 indeed us self flagellation reached its zenith during the presidency of jimmy carter _meta_end_dot_

 i ve always thought you could tell a fair amount about someone by whether they became more agitated by unnecessary american wars that kill millions of people or the sometimes excessive self flagellation that follows those wars _meta_end_dot_

 anyway as far as i can tell ferguson s point is that kissinger grew admirably concerned with the side effects of policies he kissinger advocated no mention of watergate in this paragraph by the way _meta_end_dot_

 how admirable _meta_end_dot_

 but now back to ferguson s original question or rather accusation _meta_end_dot_

 here s ferguson immediately after posing his query nota bene this is not to imply that his critics are anti semites _meta_end_dot_

 some of the rothschilds most fierce critics were also jews _meta_end_dot_

 so are some of kissinger s _meta_end_dot_

 one could say this doesn t advance the issue one iota but neither does the rest of the piece the subject is not raised again until the last paragraph _meta_end_exclamation_

 how far kissinger s jewishness provides the real key to his inner motivations remains a matter for debate _meta_end_dot_

 my own preference would be to see him as first and foremost a historian one of the very select band of serious scholars of the past who end up actually making policy in the here and now but it certainly provides a part of the explanation for the vitriol that has come his way _meta_end_dot_

 to make this accusation without one iota of supporting evidence certainly takes a fair amount of gumption _meta_end_dot_

 unfortunately it also turns what could have been a compelling article into something much more sinister _meta_end_dot_

 update so why do i think kissinger gets more attention than other architects of american foreign policy _meta_end_question_

 let me count the ways he was secretary of state to our most unpopular president he helped prosecute our least popular war he is as a commenter points out still alive today unlike dulles he is beloved by much of the media and gets kid glove treatment from the establishment his list of questionable actions is particularly long and involves many many countries etc _meta_end_dot_

 his jewishness does not needless to say make the cut _meta_end_dot_
