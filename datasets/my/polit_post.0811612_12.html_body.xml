  jonathan weisman profiles john mccain s tax cut flip floppery _meta_end_dot_

 it seems worth adding a few points here for context _meta_end_dot_

 one is that the sum of money involved is enormous this isn t some small point of detail but a fundamental really large public policy issue _meta_end_dot_

 the other is that mccain hasn t made any real effort to explain himself he s just misportrayed his past position and sent doug holt eakin out to say things like he s looking forward not back and that s great a campaign should focus on the future _meta_end_dot_

 but still we re normally interested in understanding the thinking of our candidates for public office _meta_end_dot_

 when a candidate can t explain a change of position it s usually just that he doesn t really give a damn about the underlying question so figured he should blow with the wind _meta_end_dot_

 and so far as that goes fine i don t really care if mccain has flip flopped on tobacco regulations or not _meta_end_dot_

 but what we re seeing here is that mccain takes a devil may care attitude to the largest macroeconomic policy decisions the president faces _meta_end_dot_
