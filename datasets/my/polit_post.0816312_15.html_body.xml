  i think i m going to start stealing a page from ezra klein and doing a daily requests thread _meta_end_dot_

 i put up the thread you guys suggest topics you d like to see me blog about or questions you d like to see me answer and then the next day i answer the request _meta_end_dot_

 it seems to me like a feature that s worked well for him so why not here _meta_end_question_

 so what would you like to read about _meta_end_question_
