 i suppose this is an obvious point to make but you ve got to assume that some of the states who were so eager to move their primaries up to february _meta_number_ref_ are having some regrets right now _meta_end_dot_

 new jersey just kinda got lost in the shuffle back in the day as a clinton quasi home state but if they had an april _meta_number_ref_ primary we d all be hearing about the unique challenges facing the garden state right now _meta_end_dot_
