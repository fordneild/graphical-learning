  wonks of the world are still waiting for john mccain to come out with some kind of proposals on education policy _meta_end_dot_

 it s well known that in general mccain isn t interested in domestic issues _meta_end_dot_

 still on broad economic policy he at least manages to a admit that he doesn t know what he s talking about and then b start getting his advice from corrupt crank phil graham _meta_end_dot_

 similarly on health care he groped his way to the conservative orthodoxy _meta_end_dot_

 on energy and the environment he s taken the nuclear industry s talking points _meta_end_dot_

 but on education there are really two different kinds of conservative orthodoxy and they point in different directions so mccain has decided to give us _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 nothing whatsoever _meta_end_dot_
