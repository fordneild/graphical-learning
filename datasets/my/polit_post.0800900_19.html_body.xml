  as we ve seen from the exit polls she pulled ahead based on strong support from women _meta_end_dot_

 update i should say we re seeing some talk of a wilder effect possibly doing obama in _meta_end_dot_

 i don t buy that _meta_end_dot_

 if you look at the breakdown of the results you d need to believe that white women but not white men are inclined to lie to pollsters about that _meta_end_dot_

 more likely we re looking at a combination of gender backlash plus the fact that obama was so widely perceived as likely to win led independents to vote for john mccain in the gop primary _meta_end_dot_
