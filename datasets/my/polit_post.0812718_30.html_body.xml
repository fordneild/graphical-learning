  did you know that this week is national charter schools week _meta_end_dot_

 i know i ll be celebrating _meta_end_exclamation_

 seriously though charter schools are great _meta_end_dot_

 parents ought to have some diversity of options when considering where to send their kids to school but the public money shouldn t be spent without a measure of public accountability and the charter school framework is a good way in which to accomplish that _meta_end_dot_
