  i was googling for something else and found this _meta_number_ref_ robert atkinson article about inequality while there is considerable agreement among economists over what has happened there is much less consensus over why inequality has worsened whether it is a problem and what if anything governments should do to address it _meta_end_dot_

 many on the right see growing inequities as actually a spur to growth _meta_end_dot_

 many on the left blame the new economy s dynamism and competition and pursue a don quixote like effort to resurrect the old economy _meta_end_dot_

 new economy aside i think atkinson should abandon his quixotic effort to convince us that don quixote like is a phrase people should be using _meta_end_dot_
