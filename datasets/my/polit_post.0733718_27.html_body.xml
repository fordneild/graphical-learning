  um seriously the clinton administration is attacking barack obama based on an essay he wrote in kindergarden _meta_end_dot_

 they follow up with an account of something he did in third grade _meta_end_exclamation_

 i suppose you have to respect the commitment to counterpunching and oppo research obama says he wants a new kind of politics but wouldn t share his toy truck with little jimmy when they were five how can we trust him now but surely someone must have said won t this look dumb when it was suggested _meta_end_dot_

 i ll be very happy when primary season is over _meta_end_dot_

 update that d be the clinton campaign it s not an administration yet _meta_end_exclamation_
