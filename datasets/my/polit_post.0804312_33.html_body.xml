  in addition to allocating delegates to the winner of the overall district vote here in dc we also allocate some delegates on a ward by ward basis _meta_end_dot_

 in places like ward _meta_number_ref_ and ward _meta_number_ref_ east of the anacostia river hillary clinton is hopelessly doomed _meta_end_dot_

 but in diverse ward _meta_number_ref_ where i live she ought to have a shot _meta_end_dot_

 we re not nearly as white as ward _meta_number_ref_ or ward _meta_number_ref_ but we are the only ward where you ll find no population group with a majority _meta_end_dot_

 in short there are black people and white people plus a healthy dollop of hispanics _meta_end_dot_

 are city council representative jim graham is of the caucasion persuasion so it should be possible for a white politician to secure some support here _meta_end_dot_

 indeed graham is a clinton supporter _meta_end_dot_

 what s more while precinct _meta_number_ref_ pictured above where i vote was pretty heavily black during the _meta_number_ref_ cycle when i voted there this morning it was about half and half _meta_end_dot_

 and yet while obama has a volunteer standing outside in the cold by a table full of campaign literature urging passersby to vote for obama clinton had nobody _meta_end_dot_

 similarly her campaign doesn t seem to have gotten any hillary signs into the hands of any of the residents of my neighborhood _meta_end_dot_

 consequently in what looks like a pretty decent turnout i imagine obama s going to dominate what seems to be going on here is that clinton feels that she can t maintain the pretense that maryland and washington and virginia and the other washington and maine and nebraska and the us virgin islands and louisiana don t count if she bothers to campaign in these places _meta_end_dot_

 but thanks to the way democrats allocate delegates there s a substantial difference between losing a jurisdiction and getting blown out in that jurisdiction _meta_end_dot_

 my guess is that clinton s lackluster campaigning is creating a situation where she s leaving delegates on the table _meta_end_dot_
