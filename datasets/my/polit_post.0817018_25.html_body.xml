  ambinder says of john mccain s flip flop in favor of offshore drilling criticizing the policy is an appropriate way to approach it if you re an obama supporter but why begrudge the man for changing his mind as conditions our general awareness of climate change the iraq war gas prices etc have changed _meta_end_question_

 perhaps he changed his mind for the wrong reason _meta_end_dot_

 but that s an argument that one has to make not just assume _meta_end_dot_

 the point i would make is that mccain s new view undermines an important larger argument he s trying to make _meta_end_dot_

 his latest ad features the idea that he broke with the president over climate change i e he wants to do something about it _meta_end_dot_

 specifically mccain says he wants to reduce carbon emissions _meta_end_dot_

 but you just can t reduce carbon emissions without burning less oil by in effect making it more expensive _meta_end_dot_

 offshore drilling is a way to get more oil in order to make oil cheaper _meta_end_dot_

 if mccain wants to say that high gas prices have made him abandon his previous views on climate change fine _meta_end_dot_

 but what he wants to do right now is simultaneously get credit for standing up to bush on climate while also agreeing with bush about the particulars _meta_end_dot_
