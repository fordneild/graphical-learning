  tom schaller critiques hillary clinton s pander judgment i can maybe see it in the immediate aftermath of texas v _meta_end_dot_

 johnson when such silliness briefly became a salient issue but at this late date does anyone think that sponsoring constitution flag burning legislation is going to convince anyone to vote for her _meta_end_question_

 actually to me here s the thing about the flag burning legislation _meta_end_dot_

 clinton sponsored it _meta_end_dot_

 i at some point wrote a blog post deploring that sort of thing _meta_end_dot_

 i promptly received an email from one of hillaryland s liberal outreach people explaining that the real reason clinton had sponsored the legislation was to forestall the drive for a flag burning amendment _meta_end_dot_

 that to me is pathetic _meta_end_dot_

 if you re going to pander on a symbolic issue you ve got to own the pander take the punch from the left and stand up damnit for the cause of flag preservation _meta_end_dot_

 otherwise what are you accomplishing _meta_end_dot_

 somewhat similarly the most pathetic thing about barack obama s efforts to bow and scrape for aipac are that the aipac crowd has been suspicious of him from day one and his pandering doesn t change the fact that they don t like him _meta_end_dot_

 why not just accept that he ll have to live without that small segment of the public and stand up for a more reasonable policy _meta_end_question_

 instead he seems determined to pander in vain _meta_end_dot_
