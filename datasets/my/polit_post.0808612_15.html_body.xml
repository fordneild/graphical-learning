  yesterday i mentioned the theory that racial conflicts were at the root of a lot of our political disputes even when they re not explicitly mentioned _meta_end_dot_

 then later in the day strolling through the atlantic s archives looking for something else i came across thomas edsall s may _meta_number_ref_ article on race in politics and didn t really make the connection until i clicked back over to it just now _meta_end_dot_

 but there it is a classic statement of the thesis _meta_end_dot_
