  my sense every july _meta_number_ref_ is that i could get more jazzed up about independence if it were more plausible for americans to work ourselves up into a fury of anti british sentiment _meta_end_dot_

 in the real world however america s two closest allies are the former colonial power and the segments of british north america that didn t join in our rebellion _meta_end_dot_

 ultimately i think the united states is a pretty awesome country but it very plausibly would have been even awesomer had english and american political leaders in the late _meta_number_ref_th century been farsighted enough to find compromises that would have held the empire together _meta_end_dot_

 nevertheless we live in the world that is _meta_end_dot_

 happy birthday america _meta_end_exclamation_

 these lines from the declaration of independence still ring out as incredible wisdom hundreds of years later we hold these truths to be self evident that all men are created equal that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights that among these are life liberty and the pursuit of happiness _meta_end_dot_

 that to secure these rights governments are instituted among men deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed that whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it and to institute new government laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form as to them shall seem most likely to effect their safety and happiness _meta_end_dot_

 prudence indeed will dictate that governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes and accordingly all experience hath shewn that mankind are more disposed to suffer while evils are sufferable than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed _meta_end_dot_

 but when a long train of abuses and usurpations pursuing invariably the same object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute despotism it is their right it is their duty to throw off such government and to provide new guards for their future security _meta_end_dot_
