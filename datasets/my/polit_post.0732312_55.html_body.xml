  i really meant to attend this gw event with stephen biddle nora bensahel and larry corb on friday but i wound up unable to make it _meta_end_dot_

 marc lynch was there and recounts biddle s argument that the surge might work if everything goes right and if the us continues to hit the lottery with the spread of local ceasefires and none of a dozen different spoilers happens then a patchwork of local ceasefires between heavily armed mistrustful communities could possibly hold if and only if the us keeps _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ troops in iraq for the next twenty to thirty years i guess i agree with that _meta_end_dot_

 to me it sounds like a very good reason to leave _meta_end_dot_

 i m not sure where biddle stands on that since he s usually tended to stay a bit cagey as to what policy recommendations he would make _meta_end_dot_

 at any it seems clear to me that even the optimistic scenarios for iraq now amount to promising to bear huge costs for a smallish chance at an unclear payoff _meta_end_dot_
