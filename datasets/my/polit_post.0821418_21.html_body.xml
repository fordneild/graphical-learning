  megan mcardle says we shouldn t blame bad management from gm s staggering _meta_dollor_ref_ billion loss the company is scrambling to retool for small cars and i m sure we ll hear a loud chorus of voices saying that gm did this to themselves by becoming so dependent on light trucks _meta_end_dot_

 well they did but i m not sure it s fair to blame management _meta_end_dot_

 gm s historical pension and healthcare obligations and the vast difficulties they have in permanently laying off workers mean that the company had to maximize cash flow as best they could _meta_end_dot_

 but look this is all management _meta_end_dot_

 gm could have struck a different bargain with its workforce that entailed higher salaries and lower long term pension obligations _meta_end_dot_

 its management thought it would be wiser to strike a different bargain and the results have wound up being non pretty _meta_end_dot_

 running a large enterprise is difficult which i think is why the executives make the big bucks _meta_end_dot_

 but when decisions don t pan out you take the blame _meta_end_dot_

 meanwhile car company management could have strongly backed the clinton administration s effort to get health care under control back in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_
