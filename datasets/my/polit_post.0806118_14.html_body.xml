  kevin drum shows us a slice of farcical congressional involvement in the defense procurement process _meta_end_dot_

 basically everyone agrees that it s absolutely vital to the nation s defense that the air force s next generation of aerial tankers be made by whichever company has production facilities in the senator in question s state _meta_end_dot_

 to say something nice about john mccain he may be soft on bigotry and the apocalypse but my impression is that he s done more than most to try to precent procurement from becoming a complete and total sham _meta_end_dot_
