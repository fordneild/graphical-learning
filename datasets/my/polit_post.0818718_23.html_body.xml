  k lo reminds us why she is an irreplaceable national treasure a totally crazy saturday morning thought wouldn t george w _meta_end_dot_

 bush make an awesome high school government teacher _meta_end_question_

 wouldn t it be something if his post presidential life would up being that kind of post service service _meta_end_question_

 how s that for a model _meta_end_question_

 who needs harvard visiting chairs and high end lectures _meta_end_question_

 how about crawford high _meta_end_question_

 or wherever reach out and touch the young before they are jaded or break them of the cynicism pop culture and possibly their parents have passed down to them _meta_end_dot_

 whatever you think of president bush he s a likable guy in love with his country with some history and experience to share _meta_end_dot_

 the best part will be when he explains to kids that the president does not in fact have an obligation to follow the law and can just order arbitrary detention and torture willy nilly because hey we re a nation at undeclared neverending war _meta_end_dot_

 that s right kids if president obama wants to have your testicles crushed no law and no treaty can stop him that s what the constitution says but of course if those kind of opinions are good enough for berkeley law school then why not high school civics _meta_end_question_
