  the letter from a birmingham jail _meta_end_dot_

 a quote oppressed people cannot remain oppressed forever _meta_end_dot_

 the yearning for freedom eventually manifests itself and that is what has happened to the american negro _meta_end_dot_

 something within has reminded him of his birthright of freedom and something without has reminded him that it can be gained _meta_end_dot_

 consciously or _meta_end_dot_

 unconsciously he has been caught up by the zeitgeist and with his black brothers of africa and his brown and yellow brothers of asia south america and the caribbean the united states negro is moving with a sense of great urgency toward the promised land of racial justice _meta_end_dot_

 if one recognizes this vital urge that has engulfed the negro community one should readily understand why public demonstrations are taking place _meta_end_dot_

 the negro has many pent up resentments and latent frustrations and he must release them _meta_end_dot_

 so let him march let him make prayer pilgrimages to the city hall let him go on freedom rides and try to understand why he must do so _meta_end_dot_

 if his repressed emotions are not released in nonviolent ways they will seek expression through violence this is not a threat but a fact of history _meta_end_dot_

 so i have not said to my people get rid of your discontent rather i have tried to say that this normal and healthy discontent can be channeled into the creative outlet of nonviolent direct action _meta_end_dot_

 and now this approach is being termed extremist _meta_end_dot_

 i feel as if the issue of king s commitment to non violence tends to get obscured on these occasions _meta_end_dot_

 how many politicians who pay homage to king today will tomorrow be preaching the necessity of keeping preventive war on the table as a tool of non proliferation policy _meta_end_question_
