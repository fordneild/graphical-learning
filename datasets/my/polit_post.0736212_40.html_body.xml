  i promised dave roberts last night that i would write a post about the evils of coal so yes coal is evil _meta_end_dot_

 on the one hand of course coal emits enormous amounts of carbon dioxide _meta_end_dot_

 one politically popular notion is that we need to do away with this problem through a combination of carbon pricing and massive subsidies for clean coal efforts that will transform coal into a low carbon alternative _meta_end_dot_

 this is dumb _meta_end_dot_

 carbon aside coal is really terrible for the environment _meta_end_dot_

 the particulate emissions from coal plants have terrible health consequences in probability adjusted terms it s probably worse than the risks of a nuclear meltdown _meta_end_dot_

 but the process of actually acquiring the coal is a whole other environmental disaster on top of that _meta_end_dot_

 if you spent a ton of money on subsidizing renewables you d have all this clean renewable energy _meta_end_dot_

 if you spent a ton of money subsidizing low carbon coal schemes you d have sunk a ton of cash into a power source that s still bad for the environment and created a whole new series of issues about storage etc etc _meta_end_dot_

 it s a dumb idea _meta_end_dot_

 i think people in general underrate the human capacity for change _meta_end_dot_

 there was a time when the western way of life was dependent on long distance wind powered ships who required for their masts certain kinds of very tall very straight pine trees that you had to get from the baltic region _meta_end_dot_

 the strategic importance of pine trees was hard to overstate _meta_end_dot_

 so was the economic importance _meta_end_dot_

 pine trees were vital _meta_end_dot_

 you couldn t possible get along without them _meta_end_dot_

 until suddenly you could _meta_end_dot_
