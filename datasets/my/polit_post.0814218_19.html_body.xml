 yes that s right the decemberists played obama s _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ person rally _meta_end_dot_

 quoth geraghty i m sure obama would draw a big crowd either way but wasn t that worth mentioning in the coverage now jason linkins argues that as the decemberists are a modestly successful indie outfit more apt to perform at venues such as the _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ person capacity _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ club it would be more accurate to suggest that the promise of an obama rally is a great inducement to come see the decemberists rather than the reverse linkins misses the point of course that the decemberists are popular enough to often play the _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ club on consecutive nights so you can see that obamamania s all hype _meta_end_dot_

 more to the point as geraghty points out this is yet more evidence that obama is a communist from wikipedia named both in reference to the russian decembrist revolt which may explain its use of the national anthem of the soviet union as an introduction at many concerts lovely _meta_end_dot_
