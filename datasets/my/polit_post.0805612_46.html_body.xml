  jeff zeleny does a piece for the new york times on anecdotal evidence of widespread fear that barack obama is likely to be assassinated if nominated for or elected to the presidency _meta_end_dot_

 i ve heard this worry before and it s something that i have to say never occurred to me until i started hearing other people talk about it _meta_end_dot_

 you re looking really at two different interpretations of what went on in the _meta_number_ref_s _meta_end_dot_

 from one point of view this is a time in which two very prominent black leaders martin luther king and malcolm x were assassinated as were two very prominent pro civil rights white politicians john kennedy and robert kennedy that should make us worry that the assassin s bullet is unusually likely to meet figures identified with racial progress _meta_end_dot_

 another way of looking at it is that there was just a kind of assassination fad in the long sixties its victims included not only progressive racial leaders but also george wallace _meta_end_dot_

 meanwhile nothing in the pre assassination jfk record singled him out as an especially noteworthy civil rights leader and there s no real indication that this is what lee harvey oswald had in mind when he shot him _meta_end_dot_

 basically during the sixties people were getting assassinated irrespective of race while since the sixties people haven t been getting assassinated even though we ve had several noteworthy black politicians _meta_end_dot_

 there was i would note a similar assassination fad around the turn of the previous century associated with anarchism but eventually extending out of any particular ideological niche _meta_end_dot_

 that s how william mckinley got killed along with jean jaur s in france and a whole bunch of other political leaders _meta_end_dot_

 it seems plausible that one or two high profile assassinations helps spawn copycats without there necessarily being any deep cause behind the whole thing _meta_end_dot_

 long story short while this account should leave us less concerned than many that barack obama would be shot but more concerned that a single assassination could turn into a wave _meta_end_dot_
