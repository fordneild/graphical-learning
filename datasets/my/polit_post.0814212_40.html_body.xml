  jessica valenti notes that gop consultant alex castellanos thinks it s sometimes accurate to call a woman a bitch to perhaps overanalyze the trouble here is that bitch is what they call a thick moral concept in the philosophy game _meta_end_dot_

 a thin moral concept purely expresses a judgment so you might say something was good or bad and that doesn t carry any descriptive content apart from the ethical evaluation _meta_end_dot_

 but there are also thick moral concepts like brave to call an act brave is to praise it just like calling it good is but it s not merely to praise it you might agree that someone has done something praiseworthy but still say brave is an inappropriate description because it didn t involve risk in the right kind of way _meta_end_dot_

 one of the ways in which sexism in our society works is that there are several highly gendered thick moral concepts of which bitch and slut are probably the most salient _meta_end_dot_

 it s true of course that some women do manifest the non normative descriptive qualities associated with those terms _meta_end_dot_

 but the crux of the matter is that the alleged accuracy or lack thereof of such a term is besides the point the concepts themselves are part of an inherently sexist conceptual scheme the terms just are the moral vocabulary of the sexist _meta_end_dot_
