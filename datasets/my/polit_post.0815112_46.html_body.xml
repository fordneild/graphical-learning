  alyssa today s new york times has a good short history of the governor s history on gay rights in the wake of his decision to declare that new york will recognize the marriages of gay couples who get hitched elsewhere _meta_end_dot_

 unsurprisingly this anecdote leads the piece when david a _meta_end_dot_

 paterson was growing up and his parents would go out of town he and his little brother would stay in harlem with family friends they called uncle stanley and uncle ronald _meta_end_dot_

 uncle stanley and uncle ronald he said were a gay couple though in the _meta_number_ref_s few people described them that way _meta_end_dot_

 they helped young david with his spelling and read to him and played cards with him _meta_end_dot_

 apparently my parents never thought we were in any danger the governor recalled on thursday in an interview _meta_end_dot_

 i was raised in a culture that understood the different ways that people conduct their lives _meta_end_dot_

 and i feel very proud of it it s always interesting to hear about the personal places that politicians stances come from _meta_end_dot_

 that this story illustrates a pretty basic principle that people who get to know gay people usually end up supporting their rights to live in full equality with everyone else doesn t make it any less compelling _meta_end_dot_
