  what mark schmitt said about this _meta_end_dot_

 it s astounding that the clinton campaign has in essence wasted an enormous amount of senior staff time on trying to spin reporters and bloggers about superdelegates _meta_end_dot_

 the only way they could possibly persuade superdelegates to rally around the clinton cause would be to start putting some convincing wins together _meta_end_dot_

 having lost _meta_number_ref_ primaries and caucuses in a row at this point that means very solid wins in texas and ohio not more bluster about michigan _meta_end_dot_

 update see for example this sort of bullshit isn t the kind of thing they need to be wasting their time on _meta_end_dot_

 persuade some people to vote for you _meta_end_exclamation_

 there seem to maybe be too many aides over there who enjoy talking to reporters and want to come up with some interesting debater s points about whether or not there was a campaign in florida and the metaphysical status of dnc at large members when they need to be talking to voters _meta_end_dot_
