  speaking of bush s knesset speech see below joe lieberman put out a release saying he heartily approves of the president s remarks _meta_end_dot_

 i wonder how joe s old pals at the dlc and so forth will respond to lieberman s increasingly demagogic attacks on the democratic party s presidential nominee _meta_end_dot_

 i suspect the strategy will be to argue that this is a new zellified lieberman but in truth this is the sort of rhetoric new dems regularly engaged in back in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ when it was cool _meta_end_dot_
