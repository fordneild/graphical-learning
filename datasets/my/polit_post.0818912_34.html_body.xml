  here s a chart from the washington post showing that despite a substantial decline in the dc murder rate and despite the fact that baltimore and detroit have overtaken us as murder hubs the dc homicide rate is still really really high _meta_end_dot_

 the facts get even more stark when you put them in context _meta_end_dot_

 detroit is an economically depressed city where _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ percent of individuals are below the poverty line _meta_end_dot_

 dc s poverty rate is slightly lower than what you see in much safer cities like houston chicago and philadelphia _meta_end_dot_

 and of course one has to assume that the high crime rate is an impediment to economic opportunity _meta_end_dot_

 depressed commercial corridors like george avenue and h street ne would probably have more vitality fewer boarded up storefronts more job opportunities if more people felt safer walking around the city at night _meta_end_dot_

 i m not sure i have a theory as to why dc s crime control efforts are so ineffective compared to some other cities though the fact that the police department has to dedicate substantial resources to special capital related stuff rather than to patrolling the streets doesn t help _meta_end_dot_
