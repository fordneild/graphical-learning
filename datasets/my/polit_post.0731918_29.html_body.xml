  josh marshall notes that huckabee s iowa surge could doom mitt romney and andrew on a not unrelated note excerpts messages from folks citing theological disagreements with mormons as a reason not to vote for him before lamenting it seems to me a shame that a largely competent decent rockefeller republican like mitt romney should be a victim of the party the christianists have constructed _meta_end_dot_

 compared with giuliani he is a blast of adulthood _meta_end_dot_

 there is some shame here but i don t pity romney _meta_end_dot_

 he could have tried to run as a political heir to george romney on the basis of his record in massachusetts as a moderate technocrat _meta_end_dot_

 but he decided to try to remake himself as the christian right candidate so it s really pretty fitting for him to be laid low by a real deal preacher man like huckabee or even a more plausible actor like hollywood fred _meta_end_dot_
