  conversations about urbanism always eventually end up going in the direction of education policy _meta_end_dot_

 after all absent better schools the city will always be a place for poor people very rich people and young people rather than for the mainstream of american life _meta_end_dot_

 to that end it s worth noting that a lot of people s ideas about the quality of urban schools are mistaken as you can see from a look inside the results of the naep mathematics test as revealed in the trial urban district assessment from _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 first off consider the number of eighth grader who rate as below basic this is bad that s your classic big city bad schools chart with dc new york and boston all doing far worse than the national average _meta_end_dot_

 except it turns out that demographic factors have a huge influence on school achievement _meta_end_dot_

 big city school systems tend to contain a higher than average number of poor kids and poor kids tend to do worse than middle class kids so cities wind up with bad test results _meta_end_dot_

 what if we restrict our sample and just look at how kids from economically struggling families the ones eligible for federally subsidized school lunches are doing _meta_end_question_

 here things look very different _meta_end_dot_

 once we control for demographics it turns out that new york and boston don t have failing inner city schools at all on eighth grade math scores their schools are actually doing a slightly better than average job of educating poor children _meta_end_dot_

 their overall numbers are pulled down by their larger than average number of poor kids but when you add appropriate controls their school system is doing fine _meta_end_dot_

 dc by contrast does have a challenging population but also is doing a crappy job relative to the challenge _meta_end_dot_

 now of course things change a little bit if you look at _meta_number_ref_th grade instead of _meta_number_ref_th grade or reading instead of math or middle class kids only instead of poor kids only or the high end or the low end but the basic pattern is pretty robust new york and especially boston have average public school systems masked by difficult demographics whereas dc has a shitty public school system whose badness is masked by clich s about bad big city schools _meta_end_dot_

 here s _meta_number_ref_th grade scores among lunch eligible kids and here on the flipside are the number of non poor kids who did well on the test so to make a long story short when talking about this issue it helps to be precise _meta_end_dot_

 all across the united states we have a problem with kids from disadvantaged backgrounds doing poorly in school _meta_end_dot_

 we also see kids from disadvantaged backgrounds overrepresented in urban school systems _meta_end_dot_

 consequently average results from city school systems tend to be below average _meta_end_dot_

 but when you use appropriate demographic controls you see that there s huge city to city variation and also a huge amount being determined by the demographics _meta_end_dot_

 some cities i e washington dc really do have sub standard school systems and would do well to implement reforms that made dcps get results more like what you see in boston or new york _meta_end_dot_

 but even if all cities did get the level of performance that you see from the best cities there would still be a problem insofar as poor kids tend to do badly even in good schools in the united states _meta_end_dot_
