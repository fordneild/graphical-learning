  there s something a bit absurd about this washington post headline bush listens closely to his man in iraq in white house deliberations on war gen _meta_end_dot_

 petraeus has a privileged voice this makes it seem as if bush suddenly arrived in the white house in media res sometime in _meta_number_ref_ and starting trying to figure things out _meta_end_dot_

 the surge was already underway different advisors had different takes and bush came to rely on general petraeus who now has a privileged voice in deliberations _meta_end_dot_

 but that s not how it went at all _meta_end_dot_

 bush has from the beginning always listened to people who tell him what he wants to hear starting a war with iraq is a great idea continuing a war with iraq is a great idea _meta_end_dot_

 if petraeus told bush tomorrow that he should admit failure and open up a regional dialogue on how best to manage an american withdrawal from iraq suddenly his privileged position would be gone _meta_end_dot_

 the stature of various advice givers is baked into the cake of the content of their advice and it s not at all hard to tell what bush wants people to tell him _meta_end_dot_
