  this is pretty neat _meta_end_dot_

 according to howard wolfson pointing out that bill clinton is lying is a right wing talking point and thus all good liberals have a duty to grant clinton a blanket license to fib _meta_end_dot_

 so when clinton said he opposed the iraq war that must have been true because i m a liberal _meta_end_dot_

 and when clinton said barack obama didn t oppose the iraq war that must have been true too because i m a liberal _meta_end_dot_

 look obviously bill s in an odd position because we ve never had an ex president s wife run for president before _meta_end_dot_

 but if he wants to be treated as an elder statesman figure for fellow progressives he needs to act like one _meta_end_dot_

 if he wants to be hillary clinton s attack dog in a primary campaign then he s going to be treated as one _meta_end_dot_

 certainly he s not above criticism _meta_end_dot_
