  i for one am absolutely shocked to see a pro life administration taking action to reduce the availability of contraceptives _meta_end_dot_

 up until now i had always thought that the pro life movement was a totally sincere effort to reduce the incidence of abortions by any means necessary _meta_end_dot_

 this makes it look like their convictions about the metaphysical status of the fetus are really just of a piece with a whole set of reactionary attitudes about women s sexuality and gender roles _meta_end_dot_

 meanwhile does anyone else find it interesting that yesterday s washington post poll showed that people prefer obama over mccain on social issues such as abortion and gay civil unions by a gigantic _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ margin _meta_end_question_

 that s not even close but the conventional wisdom usually holds that these topics give the gop an edge _meta_end_dot_

 social conservatives like to say they do of course but economic populists tend to say the same thing too _meta_end_dot_

 but that s a bigger lead than obama has on say the economy as an issue _meta_end_dot_
