  robert farley says indeed to the extent that the united states must devote years billions upon billions of dollars and hundreds of thousands of troops to winning in iraq the very purpose of the invasion is undermined _meta_end_dot_

 it does no good to throw some little country against the wall if in doing so our own capacity to act is severely wounded other little countries that might have been intimidated take note of the fact that we are incapable of acting _meta_end_dot_

 this was of course why don rumsfeld bitterly resisted proposals to go into iraq with substantially more troops why he resisted the idea of increasing troop levels and why he resisted the shift to counter insurgency he understood that such moves undermined the purpose of the invasion in the first place _meta_end_dot_

 to the extent that the war has been about the extension of american imperium it has failed disastrously _meta_end_dot_

 i would just emphasize that bit about rumsfeld _meta_end_dot_

 to the extent that post _meta_number_ref_ tactics have proven relatively successful in stabilizing iraq this does not provide a viable tactical implementation of the strategy encapsulated in bush s preventive war doctrine _meta_end_dot_

 that strategy requires that it be possible to subdue medium sized countries in a sufficiently easy and uncompromising way that we could credibly threaten to do it over and over again _meta_end_dot_

 what we ve seen in the surge era is that not only is stabilizing an iraq sized country extremely difficult but also that having any measure of success requires you to really lower the horizons for success _meta_end_dot_

 one of the most successful things we ve done since general petraeus took over was simply make peace with groups we were formerly trying to subdue _meta_end_dot_

 and of course the fewer people you try to fight the lower your costs get but also the range of objectives you could achieve gets narrower _meta_end_dot_

 bushism was founded on the presumption that we could accomplish a great deal with ease through the use of force unrestrained by law or institutions and it failed miserably _meta_end_dot_
