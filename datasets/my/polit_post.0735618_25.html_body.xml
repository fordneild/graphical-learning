  much more consequential than mitt romney s troubled relationship with anecdotes is this wired story about romney s approach to illegal surveillance issues i m pointing this out because it makes me wonder how the debate over national security is going to shake out as the presidential election proceeds _meta_end_dot_

 it sounded as if the romney team was adopting the bush administration s approach of mis characterizing the placement of minimal checks on the system as harmful to national security _meta_end_dot_

 well i don t wonder how it s going to proceed on the republican side _meta_end_dot_

 whoever wins the nomination is going to mischaracterize the placement of minimal checks on the system as harmful to national security _meta_end_dot_

 the question is whether the other candidate will aggressively fight on these issues not just defensively pleading no no mean republicans please stop saying i hate america and hoping to shift the debate to jobs and the economy but actually going on the attack about the mess bush has made of our constitution _meta_end_dot_

 i m not especially optimistic but i try to keep my hopes up _meta_end_dot_
