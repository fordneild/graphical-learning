  ta nehisi coates article about bill cosby in the new atlantic reaches that high standard of excellent for long form magazine writing wherein it s not really viable to adequately summarize the piece in a way that makes it possible to blog about _meta_end_dot_

 instead i d just like to flag one interesting thread that coates weaves the idea of a distinct black conservative political and intellectual tradition in america but cosby s rhetoric played well in black barbershops churches and backyard barbecues where a unique brand of conservatism still runs strong _meta_end_dot_

 shortly after cosby took his pound cake message on the road i wrote an article denouncing him as an elitist _meta_end_dot_

 when my father a former black panther read it he upbraided me for attacking what he saw as a message of black empowerment _meta_end_dot_

 cosby s most obvious antecedent is booker t _meta_end_dot_

 washington _meta_end_dot_

 du bois the integrationist model for the dysons of our day saw washington as an apologist for white racism and thought that his willingness to sacrifice the black vote was heretical _meta_end_dot_

 after washington s death in _meta_number_ref_ the black conservative tradition he had fathered found a permanent and natural home in the emerging ideology of black nationalism _meta_end_dot_

 marcus garvey its patron saint turned the atlanta compromise on its head implicitly endorsing segregation not as an olive branch to whites but as a statement of black supremacy _meta_end_dot_

 black nationalists scorned the du boisian integrationists as stooges or traitors content to beg for help from people who hated them _meta_end_dot_

 black conservatives like malcolm x and louis farrakhan the leader of the nation of islam have at times allied themselves with black liberals _meta_end_dot_

 but in general they have upheld a core of beliefs laid out by garvey almost a century ago a skepticism of white government as a mediating force in the negro problem a strong belief in the singular will of black people and a fixation on a supposedly glorious black past _meta_end_dot_

 needless to say there s an interesting ambiguity in the white mainstream s response to this black conservative tradition _meta_end_dot_

 the aspect of the tradition that says african americans will need to solve their own problems has enormous appeal to most moderate and conservative whites _meta_end_dot_

 but the tradition s analysis of why that s the case that america is a fundamentally racist society is viewed with horror by those some moderate and conservative whites _meta_end_dot_

 this also highlights i think part of what s so preposterous about efforts to insinuate that barack obama is a closet black nationalist his ideas are clearly liberal ideas and those a very different set of ideas from the ones animating black nationalism _meta_end_dot_
