  does the prospect of a long drawn out contest between barack obama and hillary clinton spell doom for the eventual nominee _meta_end_question_

 a lot of people have a sinking feeling that it does _meta_end_dot_

 kevin drum makes the case for chilling out by reminding us that the internecine fighting could hardly get worse than it was in _meta_number_ref_ if long bitter primary campaigns really destroy parties then humphrey should have lost the _meta_number_ref_ election by about _meta_number_ref_ points _meta_end_dot_

 bitter isn t even within an order of magnitude of describing what happened that year _meta_end_dot_

 and yet even against that blood soaked background humphrey barely lost _meta_end_dot_

 so i say chill out _meta_end_dot_

 like a lot of people i m not very happy about the direction the democratic campaign has taken but the idea that it s going to wreck the eventual winner s chances in the fall seems pretty far fetched _meta_end_dot_

 it takes more than a few nasty exchanges to do that _meta_end_dot_

 and who knows _meta_end_question_

 by keeping dems in the spotlight it might even help them _meta_end_dot_

 stranger things have happened _meta_end_dot_

 maybe _meta_end_dot_

 although it is hard to draw conclusions based on races like _meta_number_ref_ in which you saw a very substantial third party vote indeed it strikes me as a bit odd that we re not seeing such a vote mccain winning the nomination seems tailor made for ron paul to run an appeal to anti immigrant and anti war sentiment _meta_end_dot_

 it is true however that political outcomes are mostly explained by the fundamentals demographics and objective events in the world and not by the candidates or the campaigns _meta_end_dot_

 on the other hand a presidential election is fundamentally a zero sum high stakes competition so at the end of the day marginal impacts are very important even if they re rather small _meta_end_dot_

 at any rate consider this _meta_end_dot_

 yesterday josh marshall had a complaint let s note that sen _meta_end_dot_

 mccain has decided to hang tough with his embrace of anti catholic anti semitic pastor john hagee _meta_end_dot_

 and the major papers and cable news outlets have decided to give him a pass _meta_end_dot_

 i ve been hagee bashing since before it was cool so this pisses me off too _meta_end_dot_

 but realistically it s not the press and the cable networks that gave mccain a pass it was hillary clinton and barack obama _meta_end_dot_

 they gave him a pass because of course they were arguing with each other _meta_end_dot_

 for a little while during the wisconsin texas interregnum obama did pivot in the direction of mccain and it gave clinton the opportunity to smack him over the head with a frying pan _meta_end_dot_

 i assume neither campaign is going to make that mistake again until this thing is actually wrapped up _meta_end_dot_

 but that means that there ll be nobody effectively pressing the media with anti mccain talking points _meta_end_dot_

 it also means that clinton will continue re enforcing whatever good lines of attack mccain comes up with against obama and if mccain starts delivering good anti clinton lines obama will probably start re enforcing those too _meta_end_dot_

 this kind of dynamic hardly guarantees defeat in november but it s hard to see how it helps _meta_end_dot_
