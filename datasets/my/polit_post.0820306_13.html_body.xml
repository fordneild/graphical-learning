  for some reason the nyt chose to bury their lead about the maliki endorsement of barack obama s iraq plans _meta_end_dot_

 centcom wants us to think that endorsement was a mistranslation but der spiegel has tapes and the tapes show maliki in arabic endorsing obama s view but the interpreter for the interview works for mr _meta_end_dot_

 maliki s office not the magazine _meta_end_dot_

 and in an audio recording of mr _meta_end_dot_

 maliki s interview that der spiegel provided to the new york times mr _meta_end_dot_

 maliki seemed to state a clear affinity for mr _meta_end_dot_

 obama s position bringing it up on his own in an answer to a general question on troop presence _meta_end_dot_

 the following is a direct translation from the arabic of mr _meta_end_dot_

 maliki s comments by the times obama s remarks that if he takes office in _meta_number_ref_ months he would withdraw the forces we think that this period could increase or decrease a little but that it could be suitable to end the presence of the forces in iraq note also the following hilarious moment in lack of self awareness on the part of at least one us military officer but a senior military official in iraq said top american commanders expressed surprise and confusion over mr _meta_end_dot_

 maliki s published remarks _meta_end_dot_

 the official added however that no american officers spoke to the iraqi prime minister or any of his top aides about them _meta_end_dot_

 this isn t the first time this has happened with the prime minister said the senior military official noting that mr _meta_end_dot_

 maliki or his top aides had had to issue clarifications previously of comments that iraqi or foreign journalists reported the prime minister said _meta_end_dot_

 all of us were going what _meta_end_question_

 what did he say why did he say it and was it accurate because in fantasytown the fact that maliki repeatedly endorses a timetable and keeps being forced by the bush administration to walk it back undermines the authenticity of his support for withdrawal _meta_end_dot_

 back in realityville maliki keeps saying this because he wants us to set a timeline viewing this as the only politically feasible way forward _meta_end_dot_
