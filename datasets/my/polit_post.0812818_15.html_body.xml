  bill kristol s column from monday in a new york times cbs news poll in late february obama was defeating john mccain _meta_number_ref_ to _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 two months later the times cbs poll had mccain and obama tied _meta_end_dot_

 the poll that came out yesterday showed obama reopening a lead over mccain but clearly over this period a vulnerability for obama was exposed _meta_end_dot_

 as noam scheiber notes it s a bit curious of kristol to have left out the precise numbers from the new poll _meta_end_dot_

 but what it says is that obama hasa lead of _meta_number_ref_ to _meta_number_ref_ which is identical to obama s previous lead _meta_end_dot_

 i m hardly shocked to see kristol playing some funny games but shouldn t there be some kind of editing of the times columnists _meta_end_question_

 surely the nyt has it within its powers to be aware of the results of its own polls and get its writers to characterize the trends accurately _meta_end_dot_
