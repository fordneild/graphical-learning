  su bang says as i sit here in my cubicle at ford whq after having driven _meta_number_ref_ miles to get here from ann arbor i wonder if cheaper and improved broadband access would make the average white collar worker as productive at home as in the office thus removing the need for big old office buildings sucking up energy removing the need to commute _meta_end_question_

 if so would this be cheaper to implement than improving providing mass commuter transportation i don t think the quality of broadband is really the issue here _meta_end_dot_

 at the moment i m sitting at the big bear cafe pictured above at a table with my non journalist housemate _meta_end_dot_

 she s working from home or rather the coffee shop today for special reasons and normally has to go into the office _meta_end_dot_

 but whatever the reason is that her employers want her to come in most days it s not the quality of internet access _meta_end_dot_

 i do think that this is a pattern we may see changing soon _meta_end_dot_

 some employers clearly put a high value on office location and pay top dollar for centrally located offices in the middle of major cities think of cond nast and skadden arps in _meta_number_ref_ times square _meta_end_dot_

 but many companies have decided that specific location isn t all that important to them so they should save money by getting space in suburban office parks _meta_end_dot_

 arguably though given modern telecommunications technology firms like that ought to save even more money by getting substantially less space maybe a conference room and a few swing offices and having most people do most of their work from home or some friendly venue in the neighborhood _meta_end_dot_

 if transportation costs continue to rise we ll probably see some change on the margin here _meta_end_dot_

 and there are of course good reasons to think we should adopt policies that will improve the quality of broadband in the united states _meta_end_dot_

 would that be cheaper than new transit construction _meta_end_question_

 presumably but it would also be cheaper than new highway construction _meta_end_dot_

 i don t think and i don t think anyone thinks that there s a compelling case for reducing our overall level of infrastructure spending _meta_end_dot_

 the question is primarily one of how much of that should be road spending and how much should be transit spending _meta_end_dot_

 the telecommuting issue though interesting in its own right is basically an independent issue _meta_end_dot_

 update alyssa rosenberg had a piece about the federal government s teleworking initiatives which are ahead of most of the private sector and starting to serve as a model _meta_end_dot_
