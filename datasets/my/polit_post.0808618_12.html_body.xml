  the most salient characteristic of the ottoman empire at the end of the eighteenth century was its decentralization _meta_end_dot_

 in fact the ottoman state can only be considered an empire in the loose sense in which the term is used to refer to such medieval states as the chinese under the late t and dynasty _meta_end_dot_

 its administrative establishment economic system and social organization all call to mind the structure of a premodern state _meta_end_dot_

 on paper ottoman territory at the turn of the nineteenth century stretched from algeria to yemen bosnia to the caucuses and eritrea to basra encompassing a vast area inhavied by some _meta_number_ref_ million people my note this was a lot at the time _meta_end_dot_

 in practice the reach of the ottoman government in istanbul rarely extended beyond the central provinces of anatolia and rumelia and then only weakly _meta_end_dot_

 that s from m _meta_end_dot_

 s kr hanioglu s a brief history of the late ottoman empire which would probably sell better if it adopted the pithy title long ass subtitle format seen in for example my book heads in the sand _meta_end_dot_

 what s more to prove that even a seemingly far afield topic can be turned into a book plug consider that this sort of herky jerky governance across the breadth of the muslim world would be deemed intolerable today _meta_end_dot_

 contemporary americans feel and not wrongly that in the wake of _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ we can t just be indifferent to what happens elsewhere _meta_end_dot_

 anarchic conditions or worse nuclear weapons programs in far off places could get people killed right here in the united states _meta_end_dot_

 the bush administration s proposal to deal with this reality is to try to turn the united states into a kind of universal empire that will tell other countries what they may not and must do and will mandate compliance through military might _meta_end_dot_

 well it doesn t work _meta_end_dot_

 the alternative i advocate in heads in the sand is liberal internationalism governance by agreement non proliferation and other goals achieved through legitimate multilateral processes that respect the interests of others and are capable of gaining the adherence of others _meta_end_dot_

 in the wake of _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ that path was abandoned out of a combination of the sense that it was too laborious and the sense that it was politically untenable _meta_end_dot_

 but we ve seen for the past seven years that the shortcut alternative of universal empire is no shortcut at all casting off international restraint hasn t empowered us to do new and exciting things it s been counterproductive at great cost _meta_end_dot_

 politically the path of cowardice and timidity didn t achieve anything noteworthy for democrats in _meta_number_ref_ and _meta_number_ref_ and with the bush doctrine discredited the moment is ripe to try and offer people some serious ideas rather than merely serious ones _meta_end_dot_
