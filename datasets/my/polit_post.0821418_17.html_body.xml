  francis fukuyama ex neocon bloggingheadses with robert kagan the wiliest and best respected of the neos _meta_end_dot_

 i note for the record that kagan s current kick about the need to revive great power conflict is orders of magnitude more wrongheaded and dangerous than the post _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ let s invade iraq fad was _meta_end_dot_

 my friend dm likes to say that the one good thing about iraq is that it distracted the neocons from their even crazier war with china schemes but now those schemes are making a bit of a comeback _meta_end_dot_
