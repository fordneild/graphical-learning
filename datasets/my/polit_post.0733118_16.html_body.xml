  marc ambinder notes that mitt romney s huckabee problem is bigger than a casual glance at the polls would suggest first savvy consultants look at two numbers to project whether if a particular election were held today their candidate would win _meta_end_dot_

 one is the head to head and mitt romney still leads narrowly in iowa polls _meta_end_dot_

 the second is intensity and here mike huckabee s surge breaks over the walls that the romney iowa organization has spent so many months carefully building _meta_end_dot_

 every consultant would rather be behind by five points in the head to head match ups and ahead by double digits in terms of the level of intensity _meta_end_dot_

 meanwhile rich lowry notes others noting the huckabee rudy nexus these pieces in time and the new york sun point out something that s been increasingly evident over the last few days how nicely rudy and huck s strategies mesh in retrospect it all sort of makes you wonder why social conservatives didn t just get behind huckabee in the first place rather than blessing romney s preposterous conversion to religious right values and trying to drag fred thompson into the race _meta_end_dot_

 sure huckabee s not well liked by the economic hard right but cultural conservatives objections to giuliani didn t stop his backers from pushing him on the party _meta_end_dot_

 if huckabee had just a modicum of money and institutional support i think he d be a formidable contender but he s got neither _meta_end_dot_
