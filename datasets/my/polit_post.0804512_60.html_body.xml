  reacting to a story on the opening of a vegan strip club in portland oregon ann friedman remarks this is definitely part of a trend starting with peta ads in which women s bodies are used as a way of promoting veganism and vegetarianism _meta_end_dot_

 there s also l a s vegan vixens sexy trendy and fun loving women whose goal is to inspire men to live a longer and happier life by making healthier decisions on what they consume and now the vegan strip club _meta_end_dot_

 one common thread here is that all of these efforts are aimed at making veganism appealing to men _meta_end_dot_

 the maxim like peta ads the vegan vixens the strip club all are saying it s okay to buck the stereotype of real men eat red meat because here are some naked ladies to reassure you that you re still a superhetero manly man _meta_end_exclamation_

 almost as if they re saying you won t even miss eating meat because you ll get to look at so much of it _meta_end_exclamation_

 or as diablo puts it we put the meat on the pole not on the plate it s a substitution _meta_end_dot_

 this trend seems to confirm much of what carol adams observed in the sexual politics of meat and then turn it on its head _meta_end_dot_

 i think this misreads the vegan strip club concept _meta_end_dot_

 strip clubs in general aren t in the business of using sex to sell booze and food they re using sex to sell sex _meta_end_dot_

 the vegan strip club isn t using strippers to sell veganism it s using veganism to sell stripping to portland area guys with self conceptions as liberal nice guys _meta_end_dot_

 after all food quality is probably not a significant factor in strip club marketing _meta_end_dot_
