  still no result in the south carolina primary _meta_end_dot_

 the exit polling on the issue landscape seems to me to look bad for john mccain lots of concern about the economy and immigration but it seems that fred thompson s presence in the race is preventing mike huckabee from putting him away _meta_end_dot_

 still even if john mccain wins he still doesn t seem to be getting above his ceiling _meta_end_dot_
