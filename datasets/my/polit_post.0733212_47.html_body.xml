  greg sargent discovers a contemporaneous account of mitt romney swearing off the idea of putting a muslim in his cabinet from before this issue became controversial and romney started denying he d ever said any such thing so when republican presidential candidate mitt romney recently addressed a group of a prominent local conservatives at a las vegas fundraiser george lobbed the first question if you are elected president he asked will you include any muslim members in your cabinet in the seconds before former massachusetts governor romney responded you could have heard a pin drop _meta_end_dot_

 his admittedly very smooth answer in a nutshell _meta_end_question_

 not likely now unfortunately we don t know what the exact terms of his admittedly very smooth answer were from this account but it s clear if you read on that people who think muslim candidates should be considered weren t happy with his response _meta_end_dot_

 and i ll note once again that for romney this isn t a merely hypothetical consideration _meta_end_dot_

 i m not sure that there are any muslim democrats who stand out as obviously choices for cabinet jobs which isn t to say you couldn t find someone qualified but there s not an obvious choice but it s not at all the same on the republican side _meta_end_dot_

 un ambassador zalmay khalilzad is a muslim and he s serving the incumbent administration in a position that s traditionally been a waystation for people on their way up to cabinet appointments or agency chief jobs _meta_end_dot_

 it d be really odd for a republican administration to not consider him and repugnant to not consider him because he s a muslim and there aren t enough muslims in the country to make them deserve a cabinet spot _meta_end_dot_
