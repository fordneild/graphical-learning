  via steve clemons whatever his other flaws may be israeli prime minister ehud olmert seems to understand the basic shape of the israeli dilemma israel s prime minister ehud olmert has said failure to negotiate a two state solution with the palestinians would spell the end of the state of israel _meta_end_dot_

 he warned of a south african style struggle which israel would lose if a palestinian state was not established _meta_end_dot_

 we remember of course that people threw a fit when jimmy carter said this but it s true whether or not people like to hear it _meta_end_dot_

 if israel insists on governing millions of palestinians forever and ever those palestinians are going to demand citizenship in the state that governs them _meta_end_dot_

 oh well _meta_end_dot_

 meanwhile commentary decides to be more zionist than the pm and condemn olmert _meta_end_dot_
