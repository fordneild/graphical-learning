  i feel megan s pain regaring the dc bagel situation _meta_end_dot_

 then again a good bagel is hard to find in almost every city _meta_end_dot_

 but sometimes you surprise yourself i had a pretty good bagel shop in north carolina one time _meta_end_dot_

 so when i stopped by a dutch cafe looking for some breakfast while waiting for my hotel to let me check in and saw a bagel with cream cheese and smoked salmon on the menu i thought i d give it a shot _meta_end_dot_

 turns out not to have been such a hot idea _meta_end_dot_

 at any rate bodo s bagels in charlottesville makes a better bagel than anything i ever had in dc so as far as i know that s the closest good bagel to the nation s capital _meta_end_dot_
