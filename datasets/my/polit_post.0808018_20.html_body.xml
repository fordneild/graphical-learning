  ezra klein offers a nice distinction when talking about costs folks need to distinguish whether they re talking about getting more value for each dollar or reducing total spending _meta_end_dot_

 the two might not be the same _meta_end_dot_

 prevention for instance gets far more value out of each dollar _meta_end_dot_

 but if it keeps people alive a whole lot longer that s more time for them to contract various illnesses and when they grow old to die from something expensive _meta_end_dot_

 so though prevention may mean our health dollars are doing a whole lot more good it may not mean we re spending less as a total percentage of gdp _meta_end_dot_

 right _meta_end_dot_

 nothing saves money like swift death at a relatively young age _meta_end_dot_

 conversely if you re healthy and live a long time you ll likely wind up needing long term care which is hugely expensive _meta_end_dot_

 everybody gets sick and dies at some point so any successful medical treatment merely ensures that future treatments will be needed _meta_end_dot_

 but even though you sometimes see scary charts there s really nothing wrong with the share of gdp that goes to health care increasing if we re getting good value for that money in terms of longer more capable lives _meta_end_dot_
