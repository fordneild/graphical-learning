  i m not sure if it s possible to sell short on intrade but if it is i think you d have to consider rudy giuliani pretty seriously overvalued at these prices _meta_end_dot_

 he never seemed like a likely nominee to me for the obvious reasons and his strategy of skipping all the early primary states was clearly a mistake _meta_end_dot_

 i suppose you could see giuliani winning if huckabee mccain and romney all manage to stay in the field for a while each drawing substantial support and letting giuliani eke out a series of plurality wins but that sounds far fetched to me _meta_end_dot_
