  jeet heer suggests apropos of the latest flareups of the are blacks inferior debate is that one way to address this tiresome topic from an unexplored angle is to look at a now largely forgotten figure who is cited as an authority in the bell curve nathaniel weyl _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ and here it goes the flavor of weyl s thought can be captured in an article he wrote in _meta_number_ref_ for the journal intelligence arguing for the superiority of white rhodesians with evidence from his own visit to salisbury the capital of rhodesia i e zimbabwe when it was under white supremacist rule _meta_end_dot_

 thus white rhodesians are an elite element within the english speaking world in terms of psychometric intelligence weyl argued _meta_end_dot_

 this finding is reinforced by visual impressions _meta_end_dot_

 salisbury whites appear larger healthier more vigorous alert and bright than london whites _meta_end_dot_

 beatniks transvestites and obvious homosexuals are conspicuously absent weyl s writings were once very popular many issues of national review in the _meta_number_ref_s carry ads for his books available through the conservative book club _meta_end_dot_

 but he s disappeared from the memory of even conservatives in recent decades the bell curve is surely one of the very few places where he s cited with respect _meta_end_dot_

 most people reading his comments about beatniks can spot the obvious political bias that shaped his work _meta_end_dot_

 i don t think weyl s successors are going to enjoy a happier fate _meta_end_dot_

 and no doubt back then there were people condemning weyl as a racist and others hailing him as a brave hero eager to speak the truth no matter how politically incorrect it may have been _meta_end_dot_

 meanwhile i m shocked to find racists associated with race science _meta_end_exclamation_

 or racists associated with the origins of the conservative movement _meta_end_exclamation_

 i don t know where liberals get these crazy ideas _meta_end_dot_
