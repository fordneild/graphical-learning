  ed glaeser rightly bemoans the presidential campaign s lack of interest in big city issues _meta_end_dot_

 ryan avent says voters must be the ones to demand more urban policy proposals from the the candidates and wonders why they don t _meta_end_dot_

 i think it s more a question of the voters who care about these things not living in the right places _meta_end_dot_

 neither iowa nor new hampshire nor south carolina includes a substantially sized city _meta_end_dot_

 what s more at the moment we re in a dynamic where general election campaigns don t seriously target california new york illinois or texas but those states contain the bulk of our biggest metro areas _meta_end_dot_

 insofar as states like florida and virginia get targeted you might see candidates trying to take on transportation and planning issues that have salience in those places but realistically it s hard for big cities to figure on the agenda in a big way when new york los angeles chicago dallas houston and the bay area are all off the table in electoral college terms _meta_end_dot_

 on the other hand presidents don t really write the laws congress does and the house democratic caucus is full of leaders and chairpeople from in and around large metropolitan areas _meta_end_dot_

 given a sympathetic president to sign things they write they could probably do a lot of good _meta_end_dot_

 on the other hand the senate is structured so as to largely disenfranchise urban america so maybe we re doomed _meta_end_dot_
