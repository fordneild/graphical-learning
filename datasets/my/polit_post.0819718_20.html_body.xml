  mark thoma wonders what s going on then here s the question _meta_end_dot_

 why hasn t the obama campaign opened their christmas gifts and made use of them _meta_end_question_

 why haven t they gone after mccain s disgrace remark regarding social security _meta_end_question_

 have they said anything at all about that _meta_end_question_

 why haven t they hammered away at some of his statements and the inconsistencies surrounding them about carve out privatization plans _meta_end_question_

 will they do anything with the implication identified above that mccain must be planning to cut benefits _meta_end_question_

 why so much silence from the obama campaign on the social security issue _meta_end_question_

 he s not the only one _meta_end_dot_

 all i d observe is that i recall obama supporters having very similar sentiments about obama s campaign against hillary clinton about _meta_number_ref_ months ago _meta_end_dot_

 people wanted to see hard hitting attacks and they were disappointed _meta_end_dot_

 attacks came eventually of course but not until substantially later _meta_end_dot_

 and beyond that the attacks mostly came as counterpunching efforts a kind of judo _meta_end_dot_

 now maybe this means that obama s team has a brilliant strategy of patience that they re implementing _meta_end_dot_

 or maybe it means that they made the wrong decision last summer and wound up getting lucky and winning anyway by accident and have no learned the wrong lessons _meta_end_dot_
