  steve sailer makes jokes why is john mccain in colombia _meta_end_question_

 the most reassuring theory i can come up with is that mccain intends to bring back a couple of sixty pound suitcases that the secret service will hustle for him through customs _meta_end_dot_

 and soon obama s big lead in campaign finance will have vanished _meta_end_dot_

 and there won t be anymore questions about mccain being too old to have the energy for the job as he starts campaigning _meta_number_ref_ hours straight _meta_end_dot_

 on the other hand there are more alarming interpretations such as that mccain is taking a serious interest in the geopolitical situation in northern south america i e he wants to get us involved in a war there _meta_end_dot_

 given john mccain s legendary openness to the press one might think that someone on the straight talk express would want to ask mccain which latin american states if any fall under the scope of his rogue state rollback scheme _meta_end_dot_

 cuba presumably _meta_end_dot_

 but also venezuela _meta_end_question_

 bolivia _meta_end_question_
