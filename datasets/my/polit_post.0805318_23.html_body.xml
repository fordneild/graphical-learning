  hillary clinton s change you can xerox crack from last night got me wondering how the people at the xerox corporation feel about the use of their corporate name as a generic verb _meta_end_dot_

 it turns out they don t like it at all xerox is a famous trademark and trade name _meta_end_dot_

 xerox as a trademark is properly used only as a brand name to identify the company s products and services _meta_end_dot_

 the xerox trademark should always be used as a proper adjective followed by the generic name of the product e g xerox printer _meta_end_dot_

 the xerox trademark should never be used as a verb _meta_end_dot_

 the trade name xerox is an abbreviation for the company s full legal name xerox corporation _meta_end_dot_

 apparently the concern is that if too many people start talking about how brother s multifunction printers not only print and fax but make xeroxes too that the xerox trademark becomes diluted _meta_end_dot_

 thus in public at least they need to vigorously contest the little x xerox usages _meta_end_dot_

 in private you ve got to imagine that this is good pr _meta_end_dot_
