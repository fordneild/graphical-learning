  murray waas has a heck of a scoop demolishing mike huckabee s line on wayne dumond the rapist he let out of jail who went on to graduate to murder confidential arkansas state government records including letters from these women obtained by the huffington post and revealed publicly for the first time directly contradict the version of events now being put forward by huckabee _meta_end_dot_

 but the confidential files obtained by the huffington post show that huckabee was provided letters from several women who had been sexually assaulted by dumond and who indeed predicted that he would rape again and perhaps murder if released _meta_end_dot_

 huckabee kept these and other documents secret because they were politically damaging according to a former aide who worked for him in arkansas _meta_end_dot_

 the aide has made the records available to the huffington post deeply troubled by huckabee s repeated claims that he had no reason to believe dumond would commit other violent crimes upon his release from prison _meta_end_dot_

 the aide also believes that huckabee for political reasons has deliberately attempted to cover up his knowledge of dumond s other sexual assaults _meta_end_dot_

 in _meta_number_ref_ as a newly elected governor who had received strong support from the christian right huckabee was under intense pressure from conservative activists to pardon dumond or commute his sentence _meta_end_dot_

 the activists claimed that dumond s initial imprisonment and various other travails were due to the fact that ashley stevens the high school cheerleader he had raped was a distant cousin of bill clinton and the daughter of a major clinton campaign contributor _meta_end_dot_

 a stark reminder both of how crazy the craziness was in anti clinton circles and also of how influential it was _meta_end_dot_

 this is a giant country so there ll always be a certain number of nutters out there _meta_end_dot_

 but in the _meta_number_ref_s the clinton conspiracy theorists were in the driver s seat getting governors to release rapists and people died _meta_end_dot_

 appalling stuff _meta_end_dot_
