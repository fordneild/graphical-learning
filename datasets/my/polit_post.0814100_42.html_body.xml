  i was over on espn s website hoping to read something interesting previewing tonight s spurs hornets showdown i think new orleans will win and san antonio will get an infusion of foreign talent during the offseason tiago splitter etc _meta_end_dot_

 and win the _meta_number_ref_ championship when the odd numbered year gives them the edge but instead my eye was caught by this eye catching headline wade buys mom a church after she completes turnaround _meta_end_dot_

 can you even buy a church _meta_end_question_

 i wondered _meta_end_dot_

 but it turns out that wade didn t so much buy his mom a church as he bought a building in which to house a church that she founded a bit back _meta_end_dot_

 my assumption is that it s not actually possible to buy a church or other non profit institution though presumably one non profit could be folded into a larger richer one in a purchase like scenario _meta_end_dot_

 anyways consider this a basketball church thread _meta_end_dot_
