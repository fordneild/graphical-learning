  to repeat something mentioned below john mccain told katie couric that the surge caused the anbar awakening colonel mcfarland was contacted by one of the major sunni sheiks _meta_end_dot_

 because of the surge we were able to go out and protect that sheik and others _meta_end_dot_

 and it began the anbar awakening _meta_end_dot_

 i mean that s just a matter of history _meta_end_dot_

 and yet here s an article mcfarland co wrote which makes it clear that not only did the events he was involved with predate the surge but he was out of anbar by february _meta_number_ref_ just as the first surge forces were arriving _meta_end_dot_

 the term surge doesn t so much as appear in his account _meta_end_dot_

 seth colter walls notes that mccain himself understood the chronology correctly at one point _meta_end_dot_

 meanwhile as keith olbermann apparently noted in tonight s broadcast cbs part of the vast media conspiracy that mccain believes is arrayed against him handled mccain s blunder by using misleading editing to cover it up cbs curiously to say the least left it on the edit room floor _meta_end_dot_

 it aired katie couric s question but in response it aired part of mccain s answer to the other question instead sometimes things have to end up on the cutting room floor in television but it seems to me that if you show video of a question being asked you ought to cut to the interviewee answering that question not just show some other film _meta_end_dot_

 certainly when you ve got a candidate who s made the idea that he s super knowledgeable about national security policy misstating the basic facts of the issue that seems noteworthy _meta_end_dot_
