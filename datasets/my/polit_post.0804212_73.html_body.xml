  for those who want to hear less about hope and more about his policy agenda barack obama s jefferson jackson day speech in virginia was full of that kind of thing _meta_end_dot_

 personally i think it s probably a mistake for a speech to turn into two much of a laundry list but if you really want to see his agenda spelled out in some detail the blueprint for change document has it in spades _meta_end_dot_

 my guess is that about none of the people who purport to be troubled by his lack of specifics have read this but who knows _meta_end_question_

 certainly it meets any possible standard of plodding earnestness that one might want _meta_end_dot_

 i liked this line from obama a lot it s a choice between debating john mccain about who has the most experience in washington or debating him about who s most likely to change washington _meta_end_dot_

 because that s a debate we can win _meta_end_dot_

 that seems right to me _meta_end_dot_

 electability issues are fuzzy and who knows _meta_end_dot_

 but as someone who participates in political arguments for a living the debate obama is proposing strikes me as a more inviting one than the debate clinton is proposing _meta_end_dot_
