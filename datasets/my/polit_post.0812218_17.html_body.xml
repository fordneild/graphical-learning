  one of several respects in which i think our dialogue on iraq has gone astray is that iran is causing problems in iraq has come to be coded as a kind of right wing talking point _meta_end_dot_

 the extent to which it s true is contested but the general sense is that insofar as it s true this makes the hawkish stance on iraq more persuasive _meta_end_dot_

 i think that s the wrong way to look at it _meta_end_dot_

 bush and mccain have committed us to strategic objectives in the persian gulf region that include having a hostile relationship with iran and creating an iraqi state that will be an ally of the united states in our regional policies _meta_end_dot_

 this isn t really an acceptable outcome for iran _meta_end_dot_

 america doesn t want an iranian allied iraq but an iranian allied canada would be unacceptable on a whole more profound level _meta_end_dot_

 in response to this dynamic i think it would be coherent to say that we should basically just leave iraq and not worry too much about it _meta_end_dot_

 it would also be coherent to say that we should make a stronger effort at a diplomatic rapprochement with iran that would make our goals in iraq compatible _meta_end_dot_

 but neither of those are options available to the hawks _meta_end_dot_

 given that the main alternative would be to deny that iran is actually capable of frustrating our objectives in iraq _meta_end_dot_

 but according to the administration they are capable of doing so they re behind all sorts of malfeasance that we re told is responsible for our casualty trends heading in the wrong direction _meta_end_dot_

 at the same time accepting even the most alarmist accounts of iranian involvement in iraq the iranians are investing many fewer resources in iraq than is say the united states _meta_end_dot_

 and though the u s a _meta_end_dot_

 has more resources to expend the iraqi theater is also much more significant to iran than it is to the united states _meta_end_dot_

 maybe it s really true that the surge was working or at least that iran thought it was working and so iran turned the faucet up a bit more and now suddenly it s not working _meta_end_dot_

 that would seem to augur very poorly for the future of our mission there since surely the iranians aren t at a point of maximum commitment yet and we re actually past our maximum point currently and attempting to de surge our forces to a more sustainable level _meta_end_dot_
