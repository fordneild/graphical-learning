  mark kleiman has a provocative post question the conventional wisdom about why john mccain gets such good press coverage _meta_end_dot_

 mccain kleiman points out is a longtime member of the senate commerce committee which has jurisdiction over media issues chaired the senate commerce committee during the bulk of the _meta_number_ref_s wave of media consolidation and has always been sure to steer the campaign finance reform agenda in media friendly ways rather than take up causes like free airtime _meta_end_dot_

 basically mccain getting good coverage from the corporate media is in part something just along the lines of james inhof being well liked by the energy industry _meta_end_dot_

 if exxon mobile owned a television network he d be a superstar _meta_end_dot_
