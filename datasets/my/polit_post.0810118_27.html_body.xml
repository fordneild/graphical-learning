  i went to a netroots nation fundraiser in town yesterday evening and on hand to talk a bit were some of our best most solid progressive members of congress including senator russ feingold and reps _meta_end_dot_

 lloyd doggett rush holt and steve cohen _meta_end_dot_

 i m not sure i d ever heard any of those guys actually speak before or not but one way or another there s this nice warm fuzzy feeling that comes from listening to the real good guys of the political world _meta_end_dot_

 so much of what happens when you blog is focused on complaining about bad actors but the morale boost that comes from the reminder that there are good people out there fighting the good fight is really nice _meta_end_dot_
