  john mccain s website s gotten a nifty makeover giving no indication that he s a republican and aimed at convincing people that he s the real environmentalist candidate in this race even though i don t believe you could find a single actual environmentalist or environmental group to bac that claim up _meta_end_dot_

 but it also has a navigation sidebar on the right hand side reproduced over here on the left _meta_end_dot_

 as is common with john mccain the idea of supporting a cause greater than self interest is invoked _meta_end_dot_

 but in this case it s an invocation to give money to john mccain _meta_end_dot_

 the cause in short is greater than your self it s the greater glory of john mccain _meta_end_dot_

 that my friends is the kind of change you can really believe in _meta_end_dot_
