  so that s gdp growth over the course of different presidents terms _meta_end_dot_

 this is obviously a very crude method by which to judge a president s economic performance _meta_end_dot_

 but surely this sort of thing ought to stop a new york times reporter from writing that bush has spent years presiding over an economic climate of growth that would be the envy of most presidents see also dean baker and ezra klein _meta_end_dot_

 that a newspaper would let a demonstrably false assertion into its news pages is no longer surprising but it is telling that this apparently didn t sound wrong to anyone charged with editing the piece _meta_end_dot_

 if you d submitted something about manhattan real estate has been in the doldroms throughout mr _meta_end_dot_

 bush s two terms presumably an editor would have noticed that this seemed wrong _meta_end_dot_

 by say that it s been a historically good economy and the times thinks that scans just fine _meta_end_dot_
