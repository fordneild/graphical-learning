  i m not sure if you ve heard but i wrote a book recently called heads in the sand how the republicans screw up foreign policy and foreign policy screws up the democrats which examines the politics and policy of the _meta_number_ref_st century national security debate from a progressive perspective _meta_end_dot_

 the main idea of the book is that the key to future political success for american liberalism is dependent on mastering the national security issue and that the key to doing this isn t to endlessly continue the vacuous search for toughness but instead to ditch the people and ideas who wound up leaving so many democrats complicit in the bush administration s horrible war in iraq _meta_end_dot_

 fred kaplan calls it a smart vital book ezra klein deems is a very serious thoughtful argument that has never been made in such detail or with such care and hendrick hertzberg emphasizes that it s not boring as those of you who get the ezra klein joke may surmise heads in the sand is not just a razor sharp analysis cum narrative of the politics of national security in general and the iraq war in particular it s also an enthralling and often very funny piece of writing today is the official release date so not only can you order a copy but i think it should now be in brick and mortar bookstores _meta_end_dot_

 also if you live in dc and have a job that lets you wander off to think tanks in the middle of the day come see me today at noon talking about these issues with rand beers kurt campbell and brian katulis _meta_end_dot_

 so you know buy my book _meta_end_dot_
