  on a christmas eve cnbc broadcast that i m sure nobody watched john fund and i wound up agreeing that there was something remarkably vacuous to mike huckabee s economic populism _meta_end_dot_

 it doesn t even rise to the level of a lie the way george w _meta_end_dot_

 bush s different kind of republican schtick did in _meta_number_ref_ there s just nothing there _meta_end_dot_

 earlier on the same show john harwood had interviewed huckabee went over huckabee s dislike for outlandish ceo pay and the outsourcing of jobs then asked huckabee what he planned to do about it as president _meta_end_dot_

 well the answer turned out to be nothing _meta_end_dot_

 at any rate via ambinder the governor explains that he doesn t need policy proposals to be a worthwhile presidential candidate i can hire people once i raise the money who can come up with all kinds of proposals _meta_end_dot_

 that s fine _meta_end_dot_

 that s good _meta_end_dot_

 but the real question is am i going to be able to be a leader _meta_end_question_

 you know there is a difference between a leader and a manager but no _meta_end_dot_

 leadership is yes an important part of the job of being president _meta_end_dot_

 but there s no such thing as generic leadership people need to know what sort of thing you want to do _meta_end_dot_

 that doesn t mean detailed legislative language on every aspect of your agenda but you need to say something about what your top priorities are and what general direction you want to move in _meta_end_dot_
