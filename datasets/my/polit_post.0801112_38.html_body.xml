  those thinking barack obama needed to get more down to earth and concrete will be disappointed with this new ad on the other hand i do think it captures something important _meta_end_dot_

 obama s unity message has sometimes seems to be mirroring broder like calls for bipartisanship for closer collaboration between elites in both parties _meta_end_dot_

 but there s always been a different better side to the message going back to the speech from _meta_number_ref_ we worship an awesome god in the blue states and we don t like federal agents poking around our libraries in the red states _meta_end_dot_

 we coach little league in the blue states and yes we ve got some gay friends in the red states _meta_end_dot_

 the point here of coming together which i think is echoed in the new ad isn t about cross party collaboration among elites _meta_end_dot_

 rather the idea here is that conservative politicians have succeeded achieved political success by portraying progressive political leaders as un american and culturally alien but that this move itself is alien to the real spirit of america _meta_end_dot_
