  romney fan katherine jean lopez steps up to the defense of mitt romney s no muslims need apply cabinet policy after reading both geraghty and mike allen it seems like he was responding to an ijaz muslim mandate idea _meta_end_dot_

 we no more need a muslim than we need a catholic or dare i a mormon in the cabinet is what i assume romney was saying _meta_end_dot_

 the cabinet should have people who are qualified for the agencies they re assigned to _meta_end_dot_

 this is more reasonable but it s not really consistent with mansour ijaz s account in which he says he asked romney if he would consider including qualified americans of the islamic faith in his cabinet as advisers on national security matters romney s response was that no he wouldn t consider qualified american muslims as candidates for those jobs which isn t at all the same as saying he was opposed to a specific muslim set aside _meta_end_dot_

 indeed ijaz s account of romney s answer makes it seem as if romney has no problem in principle with the idea of a muslim quota b ased on the numbers of american muslims as a percentage in our population i cannot see that a cabinet position would be justified _meta_end_dot_

 but of course i would imagine that muslims could serve at lower levels of my administration _meta_end_dot_

 romney just doesn t think there are enough american muslims to justify a cabinet post _meta_end_dot_

 as i said previously though we should make this more concrete _meta_end_dot_

 un ambassador zalmay khalilzad is exactly the sort of person who i d expect to see on short lists for cabinet jobs in the next republican administration _meta_end_dot_

 he s been loyal to the bush administration is respected by the establishment is currently serving in an important subcabinet job etc _meta_end_dot_

 would romney consider him _meta_end_question_

 based on ijaz s account the answer is no _meta_end_dot_
