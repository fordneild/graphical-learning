  david leonhardt says if you re confused by the current financial market problems you re not alone i m here to urge you not to feel sheepish _meta_end_dot_

 this may not be entirely comforting but your confusion is shared by many people who are in the middle of the crisis _meta_end_dot_

 we re exposing parts of the capital markets that most of us had never heard of ethan harris a top lehman brothers economist said last week _meta_end_dot_

 robert rubin the former treasury secretary and current citigroup executive has said that he hadn t heard of liquidity puts an obscure kind of financial contract until they started causing big problems for citigroup _meta_end_dot_

 evidently the very obscurity of the nature of the problem is part of the problem there s little understanding of exactly how much bad debt is out there or who s on the hook for it _meta_end_dot_
