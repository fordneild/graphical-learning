  given that coal and oil companies aren t run by idiots it s clear that they re not going to make arguments of the form we shouldn t act to ward off preventable environmental disaster because that would be bad for our shareholders and executives instead polluting energy firms are going to ride on to the scene as apostles of class warfare condemning carbon pricing congestion fees energy efficiency mandates and everything else under the sun as an undue burden on the poor _meta_end_dot_

 as readers know i think that argument is often factual off base _meta_end_dot_

 but at other times it has some real truth to it _meta_end_dot_

 if you make energy more expensive to use this will inconvenience everyone to some extent but it ll be much less of a problem for more prosperous people _meta_end_dot_

 but what this analysis leaves out is that the price of inaction will also fall hardest on people of modest means _meta_end_dot_

 if changing weather patterns make food more expensive then burden falls hardest on the poor _meta_end_dot_

 if natural disasters destroy people s homes then it ll be hardest for the poor to rebuild _meta_end_dot_

 if water shortages lead to scarcity and black markets it s the rich who ll be able to get what they need _meta_end_dot_

 this is the general virtue of having a lot of money it can be exchanged for tangible items of value _meta_end_dot_

 consequently the downside impact of any widespread change will be hardest on those who have little of it _meta_end_dot_

 but that s not a reason to never change our policies if the status quo is going to lead to even worse outcomes _meta_end_dot_

 you re not ultimately doing the poor any good by condemning them to live in a world of climate catastrophe _meta_end_dot_
