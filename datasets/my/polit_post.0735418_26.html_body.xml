  kevin drum aiming for some kind of wanker prize posts the following missive from a member in extremely good standing of the vsp community one thing you might write about if only because nobody else has i think is how that whole dust up over the o hanlon pollack oped looks in retrospect _meta_end_dot_

 i mean clearly they were on to something the relative quieting down of stuff that has taken place in iraq over the last several months etc _meta_end_dot_

 completely debatable whether that was due to the surge or is sustainable or is deeply significant etc _meta_end_dot_

 etc but it s not like the caricature of them put forth in the blogosphere at the time as paid lobbyists for the bushies reporting back what they were told to after checking out a potemkin village holds up does it _meta_end_question_

 well of course if you mischaracterize the critique that was made of them then that fake version of the critique doesn t hold up well _meta_end_dot_

 pollack and o hanlon concluded how much longer should american troops keep fighting and dying to build a new iraq while iraqi leaders fail to do their part _meta_end_question_

 and how much longer can we wear down our forces in this mission _meta_end_question_

 these haunting questions underscore the reality that the surge cannot go on forever _meta_end_dot_

 but there is enough good happening on the battlefields of iraq today that congress should plan on sustaining the effort at least into _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 this it seems to me was deliberately dishonest _meta_end_dot_

 part of the effort to confused people about the nature of the choice facing us by doling the war out in bite sized morsels _meta_end_dot_

 they also managed throughout the course of their op ed to obscure the fact that the surge hasn t met its stated goals _meta_end_dot_

 it remains unclear whether or not they actually visited any portion of iraq that wasn t a potemkin village of sorts _meta_end_dot_

 for some reason or other for example they seem to have not noticed that baghdad had become a network of walled off ethnically cleansed cantons _meta_end_dot_

 clearly though the summertime decline in violence has proven more sustainable than i thought it would at the time _meta_end_dot_

 equally clearly pollack and o hanlon have a good relationship with general petraeus and came back from iraq speaking from a set of misleading talking points designed to advance the political sustainability of the bush administration s policies _meta_end_dot_

 i m not shedding any tears for them _meta_end_dot_
