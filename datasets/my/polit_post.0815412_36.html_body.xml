  it s true the newish world war ii memorial in washington really is a stinker _meta_end_dot_

 it s a bit hard to illustrate the badness because part of its terrible osity is that it s been designed at a scale where it s almost impossible to take the whole thing in and offer anyone a decent photo to illustrate what it looks like _meta_end_dot_

 but the aesthetics are bad and vaguely un american the efforts at symbolism are simultaneously over literal and incomprehensible _meta_end_dot_

 all in all it s something that comes closer to belonging in a third rate soviet city than on the national mall _meta_end_dot_

 here s a lengthy complaint _meta_end_dot_

 i ll only note in the wwii memorial s defense that the korean war memorial also sucks and nobody seems to mind _meta_end_dot_
