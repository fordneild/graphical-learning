  fred kaplan s daydream believers how a few grand ideas wrecked american power won t be in stores for a few months yet but it s terrific stuff mostly focused on how the disasters of the bush foreign policy stem from bush s bad ideas rather than some lack of competence and that what s needed to replace them isn t just better people but better ideas _meta_end_dot_

 some of it though is good old fashioned mocking of the dumb stuff bush says and does _meta_end_dot_

 for example for several months afterward as the insurgency morphed into sectarian civil war between sunnis and shiites president bush invoked the elections to dispute that anything of the sort was happening _meta_end_dot_

 i hear a lot about civil war he said at one press conference _meta_end_dot_

 the iraqis want a unified country _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 twelve million iraqis votes _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 it s an indication about the desire for people to live in a free society but it indicated no such thing _meta_end_dot_

 had bush looked at his own country s history he would have seen that the election sporting the highest turnout ever with _meta_number_ref_ percent of the eligible population voting was the election of _meta_number_ref_ the election right before the american civil war _meta_end_dot_

 get it _meta_end_question_

 at any rate i m afraid you may buy only one eric nelson edited book about american foreign policy published by john wiley sons in _meta_number_ref_ and if so i want to make sure it s my book and not kaplan s that you buy _meta_end_dot_

 so whatever else you do don t buy fred kaplan s book _meta_end_exclamation_

 but if you can borrow a review copy from a blogger friend or something it d be well worth your time to read it _meta_end_dot_

 might even whet your appetite for someone else s book _meta_end_dot_
