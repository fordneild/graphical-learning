  i guess it never occurred to me that there might be a sizable and vocal minority of israelis who go around booing moments of silence for yitzhak rabin urging lenient treatment of yigal amir by the israeli prison system but i guess it makes sense when you think about it _meta_end_dot_

 it s hardly an original to me observation but amir really does seem like the rare assassin who actually managed to be quite effective at advancing his agenda _meta_end_dot_
