  it looks like the bush petraeus plan to compensate for the failure of the surge to accomplish its goal by aiming instead for bottom up reconciliation is running into the wee hurdle that bottom up reconciliation isn t a kind of reconciliation at all and the shiite dominated government doesn t want to incorporate american trained anti government sunni insurgents into its security forces _meta_end_dot_

 what a surprise _meta_end_exclamation_

 there s a reason after all why national reconciliation was postulated as the surge s goal absent reconciliation there s nothing useful we can do _meta_end_dot_

 unfortunately when the surge failed to accomplish its purpose instead of abandoning the strategy we abandoned the goal in favor of this nonsensical one _meta_end_dot_
