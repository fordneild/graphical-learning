  paul krugman notes the _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ split on the question of whether or not the invasion of iraq was worth it and remarks with satisfaction the fact that we re not squandering lives at the same rate we were a year ago we re still squandering money as fast as ever does not seem to have convinced people that the war we were misled into was a good idea hasn t convinced people that is except for hard core republicans and hillary clinton who krugman keeps telling us is preferable to barack obama and his unsound deviationism _meta_end_dot_

 or is it that clinton didn t think invading iraq was a good idea but despite her _meta_number_ref_ years of experience fighting for change didn t realize the significance of what she was voting on _meta_end_question_

 i m quite certain i d be happier with the foreign policy hillary clinton would conduct in office than i d be with the one john mccain would conduct but her actual record on this count seems like a pretty sufficient reason to support a viable alternative in the primary _meta_end_dot_

 after all if neither clinton nor obama had decided to run in _meta_number_ref_ it s hard for me to imagine that a lot of people would have been sitting around early in the cycle saying you know what the party really needs in a nominee _meta_end_question_

 an iraq war supporter _meta_end_dot_

 those people look really substantively and politically savvy and i want to ensure that their hawkish gamble pays off to encourage future legislators to act just like them
