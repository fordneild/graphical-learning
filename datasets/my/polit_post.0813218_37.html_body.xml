  on television of course it s difficult to make a nuanced point but it occurred to me when discussing the whole should hillary drop out issue that a decision to end her campaign needn t deprive the ellen malcolms of the world their chance to register a vote for the first viable woman presidential candidate _meta_end_dot_

 if she announced that she was done campaigning on monday she d still be on the ballot in west virginia on tuesday and in kentucky a week later and she d still probably win both states _meta_end_dot_

 folks are still out there voting for mike huckabee after all _meta_end_dot_

 the difference is just that huckabee isn t actively campaigning for their votes _meta_end_dot_

 he s endorsed john mccain and receded a lot from public view _meta_end_dot_

 and conversely receding a bit and starting to transition to playing a constructive non presidential role in democratic politics is available to clinton even if she doesn t drop out _meta_end_dot_

 what the party needs from her fundamentally is for her to avoid spending the time between this weekend and puerto rico launching a constant barrage of attacks on obama _meta_end_dot_

 that s consistent with dropping out or with staying in the race and dropping out is consistent with her most loyal voters still voting for her anyway _meta_end_dot_

 the specific modalities aren t very important it s about shifting the national discussion to the problems with mccain _meta_end_dot_
