  via andrew sullivan a young icelandic woman recounts her experiences with the new home of the free during the last twenty four hours i have probably experienced the greatest humiliation to which i have ever been subjected _meta_end_dot_

 during these last twenty four hours i have been handcuffed and chained denied the chance to sleep been without food and drink and been confined to a place without anyone knowing my whereabouts imprisoned _meta_end_dot_

 now i am beginning to try to understand all this rest and review the events which began as innocently as possible _meta_end_dot_

 you see in _meta_number_ref_ she overstayed a visa for three weeks _meta_end_dot_

 i remember standing in the reykjavik airport on a security line with my shoes off held in my left hand ready to be placed on the conveyor belt for scanning once i got far enough in line for that to be possible _meta_end_dot_

 i stepped forward toward an icelandic security guy who was checking passports and boarding passes who asked me sir why aren t you wearing your shoes it was a stark reminder to me of how accustomed we ve become to an ever escalating series of irrational security measures _meta_end_dot_

 what this woman describes is clearly well beyond asking people to take off their shoes but it s all on a continuum of panic and sheep like submission to a culture of fear _meta_end_dot_
