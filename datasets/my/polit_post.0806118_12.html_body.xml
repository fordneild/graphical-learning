  i saw the amusing definitely maybe last night and was eager to proclaim it our world s first nineties period film _meta_end_dot_

 obviously we have a lot of movies set in the nineties but i thought this was the first movie made in a distinctly post nineties time about the nineties _meta_end_dot_

 this morning though i m remembering primary colors as an earlier example _meta_end_dot_

 are there others _meta_end_question_

 any that don t involve bill clinton s _meta_number_ref_ campaign _meta_end_question_

 i can t remember if the film version of about a boy follow the book in using kurt cobain s death as a plot point _meta_end_question_
