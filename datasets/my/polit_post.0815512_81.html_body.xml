  i m not sure my estimation of george w _meta_end_dot_

 bush is quite low enough to believe this really happened kick ass general ricardo sanchez quotes the president as saying _meta_end_dot_

 if somebody tries to stop the march to democracy we will seek them out and kill them _meta_end_exclamation_

 we must be tougher than hell _meta_end_exclamation_

 this vietnam stuff this is not even close _meta_end_dot_

 it is a mind set _meta_end_dot_

 we can t send that message _meta_end_dot_

 it s an excuse to prepare us for withdrawal there is a series of moments and this is one of them _meta_end_dot_

 our will is being tested but we are resolute _meta_end_dot_

 we have a better way _meta_end_dot_

 stay strong _meta_end_exclamation_

 stay the course _meta_end_exclamation_

 kill them _meta_end_exclamation_

 be confident _meta_end_exclamation_

 prevail _meta_end_exclamation_

 we are going to wipe them out _meta_end_exclamation_

 we are not blinking on the other hand sanchez has no reason to make that up _meta_end_dot_

 either way though unusually juvenile in its phrasing the underlying sentiment is typical of what i ve called the green lantern theory of geopolitics the conservative conceit that willpower is the crucial variable in making our national security policy work _meta_end_dot_

 thus when resistance to national objectives is encountered instead of dealing with them pragmatically the resistance is seen as a test of will _meta_end_dot_

 since it s a test of will the most important thing becomes not resolving the issue in a productive way but demonstrating the implacability of our will _meta_end_dot_

 when strategies motivated in this manner fail to achieve their goals that merely shows the need for more will because to change strategy at all would send the wrong sort of message about our resolve _meta_end_dot_
