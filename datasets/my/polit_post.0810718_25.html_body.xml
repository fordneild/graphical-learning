  when you hear that some folks are starting up a pro israel pro peace lobby organization to provide an alternate voice on middle east questions to the neoconnish one that bizarrely prevails at the moment in most american jewish institutions you don t expect the most neocon dominated of american jewish institutions to applaud _meta_end_dot_

 so it s by no means shocking to read noah pollack at the commentary blog dumping on the new j street organization _meta_end_dot_

 what is consistently shocking to me however is the arrogance and tone of disdain that pollack and his ilk are capable of mustering for this sort of thing _meta_end_dot_

 obviously the background for all kinds of progressive mobilization on foreign policy issues be it j street or the national security network or the rise of barack obama or indeed heads in the sand is that there s been this appalling failure of the hawkish approach _meta_end_dot_

 in response to _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ the hawks launched a war that s killed more americans than osama bin laden ever could at the cost of over _meta_number_ref_ trillion dollars they ve done nothing to impede nuclear proliferation nothing to build democracies in the middle east failed to kill or capture al qaeda s top leadership made hamas and iran more powerful than ever before and brought american prestige and influence to a new low ebb _meta_end_dot_

 now obviously a lot of the folks who adhere to the ideas that have brought all this about somehow think they re right anyway _meta_end_dot_

 and fair enough there s just no accounting for some people _meta_end_dot_

 but the attitude of thoughtless unreflective scorn that you see from the pollacks and kirchicks and goldfarbs of the world is like it comes from some weird alternative reality where their ideas have generally been deemed vindicated rather than one where _meta_percent_ref_ of the public says we re on the wrong track _meta_end_dot_

 what is the counterproposal to an effort at diplomatic engagement with the existing non aq powers in the middle east _meta_end_question_

 more of the same _meta_end_question_

 because the last five years have worked out so great _meta_end_question_

 because lazily drifting toward war with iran is going to make israel safer _meta_end_question_

 it s hard to take this kind of point of view seriously _meta_end_dot_
