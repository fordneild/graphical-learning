  this business of travis childers winning an extremely republican district on the heels of two other democratic special election wins drives home how infuriating the idea of even having an extended electability argument about who can win is at this point _meta_end_dot_

 the reality is that given current conditions either clinton or obama is very likely to win _meta_end_dot_

 that i assume is why clinton is fighting so hard _meta_end_dot_

 there s no need to join david corn in reaching for esoteric explanations she s fighting hard for the prize of the nomination because it s a very good prize to have _meta_end_dot_

 objective conditions could of course change _meta_end_dot_

 maybe some kind of spate of unexpected good news from iraq or the economic picture will save john mccain _meta_end_dot_

 but unless that happens he s looking to be in terrible shape _meta_end_dot_

 the gop brand is so terrible that it s dragging candidates down in solid red districts and mccain is currently doing not so hot in polling matchups even though americans are now inundated in unflattering information about clinton and obama while most people have never heard sustained from the left criticism of mccain _meta_end_dot_

 on the house side nrcc chair tom coles seems to be heavily leaning on the notion that it s somehow underhanded of democrats to nominate culturally conservative candidates to run in culturally conservative districts _meta_end_dot_

 needless to say the gop does the same thing in culturally liberal districts because this is just common sense _meta_end_dot_

 but more to the point the idea that the gop can turn the ship around by november by revealing this strategy is going to be of little comfort to the large number of republicans defending more culturally moderate districts outside of the south _meta_end_dot_

 democrats aren t going to pick up many more seats in places like the ms _meta_number_ref_ but they hardly need to _meta_end_dot_
