  so thinking a bit more reflectively about this samantha power business i m pretty pissed off _meta_end_dot_

 sure you can rail against the perfidy of the clintons but this sort of ritualized calls for resignations is all in the game _meta_end_dot_

 having her resign by contrast is just playing the game poorly _meta_end_dot_

 remember when fresh strategic thinking and common sense were going to break with the conventional wisdom _meta_end_question_

 i do _meta_end_dot_

 the monster business was a dumb thing to say and certainly the kind of thing you apologize for but no kind of indication that she was a bad person to get foreign policy advice from _meta_end_dot_
