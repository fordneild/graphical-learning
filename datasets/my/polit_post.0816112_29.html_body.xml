  austan goolsbee speaking in part on behalf of barack obama says that since recent events have shown that the fed may need to step in and rescue failing investment banks those banks should be regulated closely in much the way that commercial banks are _meta_end_dot_

 greg mankiw seems upset about this but he doesn t mount much of an argument beyond the query here s a question for austan can an investment bank avoid such regulation if it promises never to use the discount window my first read on this was that a promise would be no good _meta_end_dot_

 a bank can t promise not to fail _meta_end_dot_

 nor can a bank promise not to be bailed out if it does fail _meta_end_dot_

 a bailout when justified isn t a favor you do for the bank _meta_end_dot_

 it s something you do because it s necessary to avoid larger negative consequences throughout the economy _meta_end_dot_

 so a promise to avoid the discount window would be valueless _meta_end_dot_

 but if the public is going to need to guarantee that financial institutions that grow too big to fail don t fail then the public is going to need to regulate those institutions _meta_end_dot_

 mark thoma and brad delong say much the same thing with some added professional economisting and the added insight that ben bernanke appears to be on the side of more regulation here _meta_end_dot_
