  professor x not only the world s greatest telepath but also the pseudonym of an actual professor says no in the new atlantic sending everyone under the sun to college is a noble initiative _meta_end_dot_

 academia is all for it naturally _meta_end_dot_

 industry is all for it some companies even help with tuition costs _meta_end_dot_

 government is all for it the truly needy have lots of opportunities for financial aid _meta_end_dot_

 the media applauds it try to imagine someone speaking out against the idea _meta_end_dot_

 to oppose such a scheme of inclusion would be positively churlish _meta_end_dot_

 but one piece of the puzzle hasn t been figured into the equation to use the sort of phrase i encounter in the papers submitted by my english _meta_number_ref_ students _meta_end_dot_

 the zeitgeist of academic possibility is a great inverted pyramid and its rather sharp point is poking uncomfortably a spot just about midway between my shoulder blades _meta_end_dot_

 for i who teach these low level must pass no multiple choice test classes am the one who ultimately delivers the news to those unfit for college that they lack the most basic skills and have no sense of the volume of work required that they are in some cases barely literate that they are so bereft of schemata so dispossessed of contexts in which to place newly acquired knowledge that every bit of information simply raises more questions _meta_end_dot_

 they are not ready for high school some of them much less for college _meta_end_dot_

 i am the man who has to lower the hammer _meta_end_dot_

 this is all true but there are basically two ways of looking at the upshot _meta_end_dot_

 one would be to say that we have too many people starting college _meta_end_dot_

 another would be to say that we need to do a better job of preparing more people for college _meta_end_dot_

 the growth in the wage premium associated with a college degree suggests the latter option to me _meta_end_dot_

 the fact that many european countries now have a higher proportion of people graduating from college also suggests the same to me _meta_end_dot_

 there s also the fact that currently at the college level we devote the most resources to the best prepared students while the worst prepared students get the least resources that s clear from professor x s article even though the objective level of need runs in the other direction _meta_end_dot_
