  i find it striking that as presented in episode two of john adams the case for independence is distinctly underwhelming _meta_end_dot_

 in particular the point that a rebellion which can only succeed with foreign assistance is as likely to result in domination by france as in freedom from britain seems like an important cautionary note _meta_end_dot_

 what s more favored by hindsight and the example of canada and australia the imagine of a non independent america as destined to be slowly but surely ground into a state of tyranny looks wrong _meta_end_dot_

 conversely however the british seemed to be badly missing the big picture as the crisis approached risking a very valuable series of possessions over some relatively trivial policy issues _meta_end_dot_

 taking the long view independence looks more like the somewhat tragic result of short sighted thinking on both sides than like a heroic triumph for the forces of liberty _meta_end_dot_

 which is a long way of saying is there a book out there about the revolutionary era people would recommend that s not in the no this guy was the best founding father genre _meta_end_question_
