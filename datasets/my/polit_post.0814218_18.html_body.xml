  washington post correctly says that john mccain is distorting history as he criticized barack obama s pro negotiations position _meta_end_dot_

 the united states really only has two experiences with a sustained effort at the bush mccain approach to diplomacy _meta_end_dot_

 one would be our effort to deny recognition to communist china during the truman eisenhower kennedy and johnson administrations _meta_end_dot_

 this it s generally acknowledged was a strategic fiasco that denied us the opportunity to gain leverage vis vis the soviet union _meta_end_dot_

 indeed it was a fiasco of such enormous proportions that richard nixon s role in undoing it actually manages to stack up in a non trivial way against his otherwise terrible record in office _meta_end_dot_

 the other is our fifty year effort to starve the people of cuba into rebelling against fidel castro _meta_end_dot_

 mccain actually defends continuing this policy but everyone with a functioning brain understands that it s been a ludicrous failure _meta_end_dot_

 so that s the path bush has been taking with syria and iran and used to take with north korea _meta_end_dot_

 mccain wants to keep on taking it put north korea back under the interdict and perhaps add russia to the disfavored list _meta_end_dot_

 like mccain s apparent belief that it would be better if we d spent another decade or two fighting in vietnam it really calls into question whether he has any understanding of what he s talking about _meta_end_dot_
