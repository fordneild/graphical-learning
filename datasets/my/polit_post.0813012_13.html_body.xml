  ed kilgore s case for an obama clinton ticket has made me like the idea even less _meta_end_dot_

 he canvasses various things clinton would allegedly bring to the ticket but in almost every case i can think of better people to bring the quality in question _meta_end_dot_

 then there s this she would also bring some national security street cred to the ticket which is an obama vulnerability that i suspect is being underappreciated at the moment this reflects i believe an incredibly damaging mindset that s been crippling the democratic party for years and the prospect of excising this mindset is the single most appealing thing about the prospect of obama being the nominee _meta_end_dot_

 clinton s street cred on national security consists of course of being massively wrong on the most important national security issue of her career _meta_end_dot_

 paradoxically a lot of folks find her massive wrongness on this hugely important issue reassuring because they and their friends were also wrong and they view having made the right call to be a suspicious quality _meta_end_dot_

 after all the iraq war may have led to thousands of u s _meta_end_dot_

 deaths tens of thousands of u s _meta_end_dot_

 casualties hundreds of thousands of iraqi deaths and millions of iraqi refugees all at a cost of over _meta_dollor_ref_ trillion and in ways that s damaged the strategic position of the united states but war opponents were all a bunch of hippies _meta_end_dot_

 i say good riddance to that _meta_end_dot_

 i got the war wrong and i think that gives me less cred than i would have had had i gotten the war right and i think that politically speaking it makes sense to put people forward who aren t tainted by the war _meta_end_dot_

 but most of all we need to ditch the mindset that says cred on national security is composed of being hawkish even when that means being wrong _meta_end_dot_

 none of which is to deny that clinton would bring some very real strengths to the ticket _meta_end_dot_

 but it seems to me that for example janet napolitano brings just as much in terms of experience ovaries and a record of building political coalitions based on working class white and latino voters _meta_end_dot_
