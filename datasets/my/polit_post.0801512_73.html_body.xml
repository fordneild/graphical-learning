  mark kleiman s with me that mitt romney would make the least bad president of anyone in the field _meta_end_dot_

 kevin drum sort of agrees with us but got disturbed after talking to hugh hewitt hugh is a smart guy and a consummate republican party apparatchik and he supports romney _meta_end_dot_

 i don t remember all the specific details of why he prefers romney but just in general he obviously thinks that romney is the most reliably conservative candidate in the gop field a couple of general observations here before delving into the case for romney relative of course to the gop alternatives _meta_end_dot_

 one would be that most conservative is not the same as worst unless you just define conservative to mean bad stuff george w _meta_end_dot_

 bush has after all actually departed from conservative tradition in a number of ways they ve just mostly been bad ways that involve him being corrupt and or crazy for example by our efforts we have lit a fire as well a fire in the minds of men _meta_end_dot_

 it warms those who feel its power it burns those who fight its progress and one day this untamed fire of freedom will reach the darkest corners of our world rather than bush being moderate _meta_end_dot_

 another observation is that one thing a smart republican apparatchik would want in a gop president would be for that president to do a decent job and undue some of the damage bush has done to the brand _meta_end_dot_

 the affirmative case for romney as the least bad republican involves stealing an insight from my colleague josh green the constant throughout romney s career is a cautious paint by numbers approach _meta_end_dot_

 he s running as a conservative right now and that means that if he wins he ll govern as a conservative no use hoping for him to morph back into the moderate he was in _meta_number_ref_ or _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 but that said it seems very unlikely that he d roll the dice on some hair brained scheme if elected _meta_end_dot_

 he might do major harm but i think it s relatively unlikely _meta_end_dot_

 compare this to say john mccain _meta_end_dot_

 he s flighty as hell _meta_end_dot_

 for years he s an orthodox conservative _meta_end_dot_

 then he s an orthodox conservative who also supports this one ill conceived campaign finance restriction _meta_end_dot_

 then he s running for president _meta_end_dot_

 now suddenly pat roberston and jerry falwell are forces of evil _meta_end_dot_

 then bush beats him with some sleazy campaign stunts _meta_end_dot_

 now he wants to regulate carbon emissions _meta_end_exclamation_

 and import drugs from canada _meta_end_exclamation_

 bush sucks he s evil and corrupt and incompetent and wrecking the country and oh he s up for re election well of course i ll strongly support him etc etc _meta_end_dot_

 etc _meta_end_dot_

 then the establishment warms up to him so he warms up to the establishment _meta_end_dot_

 so now he supports the bush tax cuts and the bush plan for iraq and the bush immigration plan _meta_end_dot_

 oh wait voters don t like the bush immigration plan _meta_end_question_

 well then i ve learned my lesson and i was never for amnesty and by the way i m now against carbon curbs _meta_end_dot_

 but you know what s great _meta_end_question_

 the surge _meta_end_dot_

 and joe lieberman in his crazy uncle phase _meta_end_dot_

 and david petraeus _meta_end_dot_

 petraeus is so great that i think civilian control of the military is obsolete and i won t say whether or not i think tax cuts increase revenue but let s cut spending a lot eh _meta_end_question_

 in other words on eighty percent of issues mccain seems to me to be making it up as he goes along _meta_end_dot_

 at his best he s cravenly flip flopping according to the political headwinds _meta_end_dot_

 but other times he just seems to be acting on whim or out of pique _meta_end_dot_

 or he s coming to middle ground positions that don t make sense like global warming is real and we should stop it but only through measures that wouldn t actually stop it the rest of the time he s just really really really committed to the military and to militarism _meta_end_dot_

 worst of all like all the other candidates for president his personal level of experience with foreign policy issues is minimal but unlike the other candidates he doesn t seem to realize this believing instead that his enthusiasm about the military and for soldiers and soldiering constitutes a close substitute for having real ideas about international relations _meta_end_dot_

 with mccain it s possible that the chips will just all fall in the right place and he ll stumble upon some workable teddy roosevelt synthesis but we re just as likely to end up conscripting teenagers to build nuclear plants or bombing iran or convincing ourselves that ranting and raving about the evils of earmarks is an adequate replacement for a grasp of fiscal policy _meta_end_dot_

 about giuliani enough has already been said _meta_end_dot_

 mike huckabee is fun to talk about but he kind of reminds me of greg stillson from the dead zone _meta_end_dot_

 we really don t want him in office _meta_end_dot_

 so that leaves romney _meta_end_dot_

 or obviously a democrat _meta_end_dot_
