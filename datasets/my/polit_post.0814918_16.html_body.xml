  alyssa there s lots on hillary clinton and issues of feminism and sexism to read today _meta_end_dot_

 harold myerson warns her die hard supporters not to turn feminism into the last refuge of scoundrels but i think the more important piece is michelle cottle and amanda fortini s discussion over at the new republic _meta_end_dot_

 the democratic field this year was a cornucopia of opportunities for voters to address their anxieties about what it would be like for a black man a latino man or a woman to run the country _meta_end_dot_

 and while opportunities like those are exciting they also involve deciding which societal ill to address first and no matter the scenario that s a profoundly uncomfortable decision for anyone who cares about eliminating both racism and sexism _meta_end_dot_

 of course the chance to address race or sex are far from the only things that matter _meta_end_dot_

 mechanics of the campaign the candidates personal histories voting records speaking abilities etc have all been crucial in this race and those elements shaped how clinton and obama presented the narratives of their respective gender and race _meta_end_dot_

 but race and gender were visible and important issues in this race it wasn t just about mechanics and it s not just about societal perceptions _meta_end_dot_

 and as michelle puts it so eloquently you have pundits like andrew sullivan waxing rhapsodic about how fantabulous it would be for america s image how great and glorious a morning it will be when we have an african american taking the oath _meta_end_dot_

 you would never hear someone say that about a woman _meta_end_dot_

 even if they re talking about the historic nature of it they don t talk about it in such grand and soul cleansing terms _meta_end_dot_

 and i think part of it is that in the history of this country slavery jim crow and racism have been much uglier more overt nasty phenomena than sexism _meta_end_dot_

 sexism is here sexism is present but it s been more paternalistic and presented in soft warm and fuzzy terms women weren t persecuted for burning their bras _meta_end_dot_

 feminism is a different cause than civil rights _meta_end_dot_

 slavery is kind of a moral scar for america so we can be poetic about how great it s going to be when we at last elect an african american _meta_end_dot_

 and we just can t talk that way about electing a woman _meta_end_dot_

 whether that was a conscious choice we made or not america s going to seriously grapple in a general election with what it will be like to have the first black president before it takes on what it will be like to have the first woman president _meta_end_dot_

 that s not a right or wrong priority it s just what we ve got _meta_end_dot_

 but it doesn t make it wrong for people who care about seeing a woman in the white house to be frustrated about that their vision is still a ways away from reality _meta_end_dot_

 update quick clarification _meta_end_dot_

 i don t think that electing a black man or a woman or a latino or anyone in particular is going to in and of itself produce substantive change in the lives of americans much less produce a magically just society where everyone gets a pony seasons tickets to the sports franchise of their choosing and a mint condition copy of meet the beatles but i do think that who is in the white house gets folks talking and thinking about what the role of that office is what qualities matter in leadership and the face we present to the world and those conversations are one stop on the road to much bigger and more pressing changes _meta_end_dot_
