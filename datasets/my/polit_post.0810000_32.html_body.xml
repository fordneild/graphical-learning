  hillary clinton says george w _meta_end_dot_

 bush should boycott the opening ceremony of the olympics _meta_end_dot_

 steve clemons says she s wrong _meta_end_dot_

 in the real world can anyone imagine this making a difference either way either to us china relations or to the prc s human rights conduct _meta_end_question_

 i can t _meta_end_dot_

 if we actually tried to ruin the olympics by withdrawing our athletes and trying to get other countries to do the same that might at least hurt someone s feelings but it hardly seems worth debating the merits of doing something totally trivial _meta_end_dot_

 still in retrospect i really do wish they hadn t given the olympics to china _meta_end_dot_

 it would have been much better to award the games to some other city for the official rationale to just be that the other city was better on the merits but then for off the record there to be some suggestion in the press that china s authoritarian politics might have played a role _meta_end_dot_

 not that the ioc thinks there should be political criteria _meta_end_exclamation_

 on the contrary ioc members were so eager to avoid politicizing the games that some shied away from the idea of an inevitably controversial beijing olympics _meta_end_dot_

 it s clearly not viable to have a formal no human rights abusers shall host the olympics rule but it couldn t hurt for the world s democracies to signal informally that a more rights respecting government would help china achieve the sort of recognition as a great power that it s looking for _meta_end_dot_

 but now that the schedule s already been set it s hard to see any protests as doing anything other than showing how ineffectual the west is in its efforts to prod china to change _meta_end_dot_
