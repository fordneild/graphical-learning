  indonesian dictator suharto is one of those people who i d vaguely assumed was already dead until i read a story about his demise _meta_end_dot_

 i m not sure i have much to say about suharto beyond the obvious bad man killed lots of people etc _meta_end_dot_

 but john quiggin has an interesting post making the case that since his departure from power indonesia has been remarkably successful in dealing with what was in many respects a poisonous legacy from the suharto era
