  foreign policy interviews mahmud ali durrani pakistan s ambassador to the united states and he s none too pleased about charges that pakistan ought to better account for the aid money we give them this all illustrates a general problem with aid as a tool of influence _meta_end_dot_

 if you see a country that just seems awesome and worth supporting you can give them a bunch of money and there it is _meta_end_dot_

 but if you see a regime that s not especially awesome and think your aid money can rope them into a web of influence you find that trying to actually use the aid to manipulate the other country prompts more than a little of the old nationalist backlash _meta_end_dot_

 doesn t mean it s not worth doing in some circumstances but there are real limits to what can be achieved this way _meta_end_dot_
