  robert pear runs down the evidence that there s no way on earth john mccain is going to balance the budget by _meta_number_ref_ consistent with the priorities he s outlined _meta_end_dot_

 to put a hard number on it according to the cbo if we extend the bush tax cuts as mccain has proposed then even ignoring mccain s proposals to increase defense spending to further cut taxes and to continue the war in iraq we ll have a deficit of _meta_dollor_ref_ billion _meta_end_dot_

 obviously there s uncertainty associated with that projection but that s the ballpark _meta_end_dot_

 that would mean something like an _meta_number_ref_ percent reduction in medicare spending _meta_end_dot_
