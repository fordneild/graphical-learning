  spencer ackerman catches paul berman trying to convince us that he was against the war in iraq _meta_end_dot_

 berman in this incident tries to chalk up the fact that many people think he supported the war to the fact that afterward i haven t made a career of running around saying i told you so did he tell us so _meta_end_question_

 the answer is that no he didn t _meta_end_dot_

 indeed he s been telling us he told us so while simultaneously bragging that he hasn t been telling us so since at least november _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 but the record is clear berman didn t tell us so _meta_end_dot_

 he supported the war _meta_end_dot_

 he offered some caveats yes but they were caveats to his argument in favor of the war _meta_end_dot_

 not only that but as i showed in my earlier post on this subject berman was happy to be counted as a war supporter back in _meta_number_ref_ when he still thought that put him on the right side of history _meta_end_dot_
