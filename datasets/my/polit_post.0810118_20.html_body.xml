  my initial plan had been to say no more about james kirchick s review of heads in the sand thinking that it might be too petty _meta_end_dot_

 but it s been suggested to me that a response would be a good way to explain a little bit more to you the reader what heads in the sand is all about rather than merely hectoring you about your deep moral obligation to buy a copy so here goes _meta_end_dot_

 it s a bit of a difficult review to wrestle with because kirchick likes to attributes views to me that i don t hold _meta_end_dot_

 for example he writes that yglesias cites careerism as the sole motive for liberals support for the iraq war as ezra klein and some others who got early copies kindly pointed out i argue no such thing _meta_end_dot_

 instead i say that three different kinds of ideas motivated liberal support for the war there was genuine concern about the security threat allegedly posed by iraq there was genuine enthusiasm about the alleged humanitarian benefits of war and there was political opportunism with all three in play to various extents with regard to different people _meta_end_dot_

 i don t really see this as a controversial view _meta_end_dot_

 more controversially i suppose the book then goes on to argue that the war has not in fact enhanced american security or brought about humanitarian benefits _meta_end_dot_

 and i further argue that the alleged political upside of indulging bush s premises on national security has been vastly overstated and that to prosper over the long run democrats need to do the work of really challenging the post _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ conceptual framework he s tried to foist on the country _meta_end_dot_

 another example _meta_end_dot_

 kirchick writes he asserts that this brand of foreign policy a liberal internationalism that places its hopes in multilateralism international institutions and a restrained role for the united states in international affairs was working well in the _meta_number_ref_s never mind that nato s war against serbia which yglesias says he supported had to be undertaken without the blessing of the united nations or that most democrats in congress opposed the persian gulf war despite the large international coalition that waged it _meta_end_dot_

 i think that you the reader are supposed to draw the conclusion that my book somehow misses the point that the kosovo war though garnering the support of _meta_number_ref_ out of the _meta_number_ref_ un security council members could not secure unsc approval due to russian and chinese vetoes _meta_end_dot_

 that would have been a been gaffe had i actually made it but in fact i do discuss the legally questionable nature of kosovo and its implications for the internationalist project _meta_end_dot_

 similarly i do write about congressional democratic opposition to the gulf war _meta_end_dot_

 in particular i write that the political problems faced by gulf war opponents helped bolster the idea that one ought politically speaking to always vote for war _meta_end_dot_

 i put forward the alternative view that voting for a smart war can be politically helpful but that voting for a dumb war isn t really so helpful and that the whole situation illustrates the impossibility of really looking at the politics of a war and peace question in isolation from the merits of the issue _meta_end_dot_

 eventually though kirchick does come to a never mind on something i really do neglect in the book namely nor does yglesias mention the rwandan genocide a _meta_number_ref_ day slaughter of nearly a million people that the u n _meta_end_dot_

 did nothing to prevent this to me is a perverse exercise in u n blaming _meta_end_dot_

 you might as well say it was a _meta_number_ref_ day slaughter that brazil did nothing to prevent and therefore we should get rid of brazil _meta_end_dot_

 the policy failure here happened in the national capitals of the relevant governments and there s not one shed of evidence that undue deference to the u n _meta_end_dot_

 was the cause of the failure _meta_end_dot_

 this does however illustrate one of the themes of the book namely the habit of many on the right of offering up examples of international institutions shortcomings in bad faith _meta_end_dot_

 did something bad happen in the world _meta_end_question_

 well the u n _meta_end_dot_

 should have stopped it _meta_end_exclamation_

 but it didn t _meta_end_exclamation_

 so let s get rid of the u n _meta_end_exclamation_

 the sensible liberal alternative of course is to keep doing the work of trying to improve institutions capacities to accomplish the kind of things we want to see accomplished _meta_end_dot_

 a broad international framework like the u n _meta_end_dot_

 is the only one in which humanitarian interventions can have any real legitimacy and viability over the long term _meta_end_dot_

 but then soon enough we get back to the distortions _meta_end_dot_

 kirchick writes he applauds the ridiculous dennis kucinich who was admirable in his ability to articulate a clear and coherent theory of foreign affairs during the _meta_number_ref_ presidential election in fact i applaud kucinich for articulating a clear theory and then attack him for having a bad theory in order to make the point that democrats looking for a far left foreign policy in _meta_number_ref_ had a candidate available to them but in fact most chose howard dean a man of much more sensible views _meta_end_dot_

 it s too bad kirchick wasted so much time on this kind of nonsense and there s more nonsense i haven t even mentioned because near the end he gets to a real disaagreement saying the trifecta of allegedly radical principle of the bush doctrine preemption unilateralism and hegemony are all as historian john lewis gaddis has written traditional elements in american foreign policy there s something to this _meta_end_dot_

 the book argues that there have long been liberal and imperialist strains in america s engagement with the world and that precisely as kirchick says the bush approach isn t really all that new _meta_end_dot_

 what bush has done i think is taken a set of ideas with a long track record of failure from the philippines to the arbenz and mossadegh coups to rollback fantasies of the _meta_number_ref_s to vietnam etc and raised them to a level of centrality they haven t had in a long time _meta_end_dot_

 worse he s done so at a time when the objective developments in the world end of the cold war rise of transnational and untraditional threats have made the internationalist project more vital and important than ever _meta_end_dot_
