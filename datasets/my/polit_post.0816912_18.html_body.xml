  why does yesterday s salt based beer chilling tip work _meta_end_question_

 i d assumed it was simply because the salt changed the melting point of the ice allowing water to get colder than it normally does but midwest product says there s more the presence of the salt does allow the water temperature to drop below _meta_number_ref_ degrees but this trick also works in part because the salt speeds up the melting of the ice _meta_end_dot_

 the phase transition from solid to liquid absorbs heat which helps keep the water extra cold _meta_end_dot_

 that s why calipygian s trick is related it simply uses the transition from liquid to gas rather than from solid to liquid _meta_end_dot_

 just like melting ice evaporating water absorbs heat from its surroundings in his example the warm bottle _meta_end_dot_

 fascinating _meta_end_dot_
