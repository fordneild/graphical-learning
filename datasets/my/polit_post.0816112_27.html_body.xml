  there was a bizarre editorial in the la times yesterday about how obama and mccain are really pretty similar dudes and it s awesome that they re both so centristy and the same _meta_end_dot_

 one could debunk this contention but the editorial itself doesn t really argue for it _meta_end_dot_

 they concede for example that mccain and obama have serious disagreements about iraq iran health care taxes trade abortion rights gun control that s a lot of disagreement _meta_end_exclamation_

 they also concede that the two candidates have different plans to solve the mortgage crisis what s more after asserting that obama and mccain support the same policies on the environment they immediately acknowledge that they support different policies obama s would reduce them to _meta_percent_ref_ below _meta_number_ref_ levels by _meta_number_ref_ while mccain s would cut them by _meta_percent_ref_ though they fail to note the difference between auctioning permits and giving them away _meta_end_dot_

 in the course of acknowledging disagreement about abortion they note that obama and mccain would appoint different kinds of judges but they don t seem to consider the fact that the federal judiciary actually deals with all kinds of issues other than abortion _meta_end_dot_

 nor do they mention social security which is kind of a big deal _meta_end_dot_

 one could go on like this but i m not sure what the point would be _meta_end_dot_

 clearly though there s a substantial difference between the candidates and i have no idea why the press would think that obscuring that is a good idea conflict sells papers _meta_end_exclamation_

 and it s true _meta_end_exclamation_
