  megan mcardle expressing some cynicism about barack obama i m watching his speech now and it s inspiring _meta_end_dot_

 but it s also saddening because deep down i don t believe that obama is going to change washington eliminate lobbying etc _meta_end_dot_

 i wish he wouldn t tell me things that i can t possibly believe and moreover that i can t really understand anyone believing _meta_end_dot_

 he might be the best president he might even make washington work a little better though i kind of doubt it _meta_end_dot_

 but he isn t going to transform american politics in the utopian way his speech implies _meta_end_dot_

 no one who has dried out behind the ears could reasonably believe that he has this power _meta_end_dot_

 so why is he saying he does _meta_end_question_

 andrew has a good response but another thing i like about obama is that megan s listening to this speech and she doesn t really agree with what he s saying but she s not snorting with derision _meta_end_dot_

 she s listening _meta_end_dot_

 she thinks it s inspiring _meta_end_dot_

 meanwhile like anyone who writes about political and economic issues for a living her opinions on these things are much more fixed and coherent than are the average american s _meta_end_dot_

 most people by contrast are relatively open to persuasion if the argument is made by a persuasive figure _meta_end_dot_

 and that s one of the things obama has that hillary clinton doesn t _meta_end_dot_

 if instead of clinton or obama i were the one sitting in the white house and i had some kind of appealing but controversial initiative i wanted to propose and for some reason i had to pick a senator to be the public face of the initiative i d pick obama in a heartbeat _meta_end_dot_

 he s the kind of person whose support for an idea makes the idea seem more compelling than it otherwise would have _meta_end_dot_

 you can imagine him getting people interested in things that didn t previously interest them or convincing people that steps they used to think were too risky are in fact necessary _meta_end_dot_

 clinton like lots of perfectly admirable senators from carl levin to jim jeffords and beyond doesn t have that extra bit _meta_end_dot_

 it s the difference between a person who has to change his policies to become more popular and a person who makes policies more popular by espousing them _meta_end_dot_

 obviously that s a quality that exists on a continuum but obama seems to me to be much further toward the makes more popular by espousing side of the spectrum _meta_end_dot_
