  in this past week i ve gone to see both i am legend and margot at the wedding and enjoyed both greatly _meta_end_dot_

 they re rather different movies though _meta_end_dot_

 margot struck me as a bit worse than the squid and the whale since jack black slightly took me out of things by hamming it up but it s otherwise really good _meta_end_dot_

 just a couple of days before i went to see it i caught the lamentable invasion on a plane flight but margot completely redeemed my views of nicole kidman _meta_end_dot_

 legend as i understand it departs massively and systematically from the book so if you re a fan of the book and expecting an adaptation don t _meta_end_dot_

 but its vision of post apocalyptic new york is brilliantly executed and i don t want to say too much about it since i don t want to ruin the suspense _meta_end_dot_

 naturally when you look back there are some plot holes but that s kind of what you get with this genre _meta_end_dot_
