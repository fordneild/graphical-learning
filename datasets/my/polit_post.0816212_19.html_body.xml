  you can tell it s general election time because barack obama s shifting his message back toward the center with yesterday s economic policy speech with austan goolsbee re emerging from the doghouse to take part in conference calls and with jason furman a more veteran political operator than goolsbee but someone with substantively similar views coming on board as a paid staffer _meta_end_dot_

 from the text of the speech a shift away from the i hate nafta more than you rhetoric of the ohio primary to something more like the center left consensus view and because we know that we can t or shouldn t put up walls around our economy a long term agenda will also find a way to make trade work for american workers _meta_end_dot_

 we do the cause of free trade a cause i believe in no good when we pass trade agreements that hand out favors to special interests and do little to help workers who have to watch their factories close down _meta_end_dot_

 there is nothing protectionist about demanding that trade spreads the benefits of globalization as broadly as possible _meta_end_dot_

 this is all essentially fine by me because i m a trust fund scumbag the center wing of democratic party economic thought has shifted substantially left over the past few years _meta_end_dot_

 you can see that as many members of clinton s economic team have grown more populist in bill galston deciding that the era of big government is back in any given paul krugman column etc _meta_end_dot_
