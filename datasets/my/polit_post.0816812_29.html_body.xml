  paulie abeles has decided that she should dedicate her time and energy to seeking to exclude sally hemings s descendants from official gatherings of descendants of thomas jefferson _meta_end_dot_

 sounds a bit odd and slightly racist _meta_end_dot_

 she s even been known to resort to dirty tricks in her question to keep the jefferson clan all white _meta_end_dot_

 so far just a strange tale but ben smith reports that she s also a mccain organizer a key organizer of john mccain s meeting saturday with former supporters of hillary clinton is best known for her role in another bitter american fight the effort by some white descendants of thomas jefferson to keep his possible african american descendants out of family gatherings _meta_end_dot_

 paula abeles emailed politico yesterday to complain that her group had gotten short shrift in a blog item writing i initiated the teleconference with mccain on saturday and was solely responsible for the guest list another clinton backer at the event will bower confirmed that she was integral to assembling the group _meta_end_dot_

 this of course is the faction of clinton supporters people who don t like black people where mccain has a very good shot at picking up new voters _meta_end_dot_

 the people who backed clinton on feminist grounds or because they thought she had the savvy to deliver big time progressive legislation probably won t be following in abeles footsteps _meta_end_dot_
