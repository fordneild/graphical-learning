  i think i agree with brendan nyhan s take on the brooks krugman spat over ronald reagan and race but can t both of them be right _meta_end_question_

 the philadelphia ms anecdote has been exaggerated and oversimplified but it remains true that reagan exploited the issue of race in various ugly ways during his political career _meta_end_dot_

 was that so hard _meta_end_question_

 i think this is part of the reason it would be better to allow columnists to argue with one another directly _meta_end_dot_

 it might make it harder for antagonists to metaphorically talk past one another were they not required to um talk past one another in terms of the formal construction of their columns _meta_end_dot_
