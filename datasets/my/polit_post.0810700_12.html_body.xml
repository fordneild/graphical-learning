  if downing shots of liquor is really the truest sign of being a man or woman of the people then i guess every dude in every frat in america is now working class _meta_end_dot_

 indeed even matt yglesias certified pointy headed elite enjoys a celebratory shot or two every now and again _meta_end_dot_

 meanwhile a little birdie told me a lot of working class protestant church folk are teetotalers _meta_end_dot_

 but who am i to correct roger simon who doubtless has so much working class cred that wine bottles spontaneously combust in his presence _meta_end_dot_
