  ilan goldenberg flags bush talking an unusually strong brand of nonsense out of such chaos in iraq the terrorist movement could emerge emboldened with new recruits new resources and an even greater determination to dominate the region and harm america _meta_end_dot_

 an emboldened al qaeda with access to iraq s oil resources could pursue its ambitions to acquire weapons of mass destruction to attack america and other free nations _meta_end_dot_

 ilan focused on the implausibility of al qaeda gaining control over iraq s oil fields they re not in the sunni arab parts of iraq among other things _meta_end_dot_

 i would also note that were this bizarre scenario to unfold it would be pretty trivial for the u s _meta_end_dot_

 military to capture or control any aqi held oil fields a poorly equipped guerilla force can t defend a fixed position in the open _meta_end_dot_

 on top of that though this business about al qaeda securing a recruiting boon from us leaving iraq is bizarre _meta_end_dot_

 according to mnf iraq the occupation of iraq is the main fact driving recruits to join aqi _meta_end_dot_

 absent the occupation there s no recruiting pitch _meta_end_dot_

 pearl harbor was a boon to u s _meta_end_dot_

 military recruiting vj day wasn t _meta_end_dot_

 and what s this business about them acquiring an even greater determination to dominate the region and harm america does bush really think they lack determination now _meta_end_question_

 it s striking how much of conservative thinking about national security these days centers around subjective factors determination emboldening claiming victory rather than on objective assessments _meta_end_dot_

 objectively speaking withdrawing from iraq would cut off a major line of recruiting for al qaeda while simultaneously freeing up vast quantities of american manpower and other resources _meta_end_dot_

 how bold that makes al qaeda leaders feel and you ve got to figure these fuckers were pretty emboldened already when they blew up the twin towers right has nothing to do with anything _meta_end_dot_
