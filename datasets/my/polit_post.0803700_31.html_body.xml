  not that mike huckabee is going to be the republican nominee but he s put on an impressive showing tonight _meta_end_dot_

 his resiliency really seems to me to underscore how moribund orthodox conservatism is at the moment _meta_end_dot_

 on the one hand john mccain is apparently going to win the nomination notwithstanding the fact that he s loathed by a significant swathe of conservative elites _meta_end_dot_

 and then on the other hand huckabee who s loathed by an even wider swathe of conservative elites keeps hanging around _meta_end_dot_

 he doesn t have the money or the policy substance necessary to break out of his niche but his constituency an important part of the gop base loves him and doesn t care what anyone says about it _meta_end_dot_
