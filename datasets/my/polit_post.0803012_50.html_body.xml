  reading what ross says here i realize that what i wrote about barack obama s admirers among the conservative pundit class is open to misinterpretation _meta_end_dot_

 here s something that people i talk to sometimes say but that i don t believe conservative pundits like david brooks like to praise barack obama because they think he ll be an easy mark in the general election _meta_end_dot_

 what i do think is that praising barack obama appeals to conservative pundits in large part because right now praising obama is a useful means by which to denigrate hillary clinton _meta_end_dot_

 as such i think part of the background for things like brooks praise of obama is belief that he s likely to lose the primary _meta_end_dot_

 i think there s a desire on the right to make the _meta_number_ref_ election mostly about the clinton family rather than being about contemporary american conservatism s horrid record in office _meta_end_dot_

 portraying the current democratic primary as an apocalyptic struggle between the forces of light and the forces of clintonism nicely sets up the general election as a second round between light and clinton _meta_end_dot_

 do i see this as a machiavellian scheme hatched out of karl rove s front office _meta_end_question_

 no _meta_end_dot_

 but that s my diagnosis of the function of obamafandom _meta_end_dot_

 if obama loses the primary obamafandom becomes a reason to vote republican the democratic party is so rotten that it rejected the one _meta_end_dot_

 if obama wins the primary i assume that obamafandom will rapidly wither away _meta_end_dot_

 it will turn out that the democratic party is so rotten that tainted the one _meta_end_dot_

 or something like that _meta_end_dot_

 meanwhile what i m trying to say about the real world is that there s just no justification for viewing the obama clinton choice as some kind of night and day moment of decision for america _meta_end_dot_

 there are differences between the two of them but in the scheme of things they re either small differences or fuzzy ones not the gaping void that many on the right seem to perceive _meta_end_dot_
