  tom friedman is really pissed off that people around the world take a dim view of the united states even though despite our flaws our government is less repressive than china s and we ve had a much more constructive policy toward zimbabwe than has south africa _meta_end_dot_

 one wonders if he really doesn t understand this but it s the hegemony stupid _meta_end_dot_

 america has long sought to play a global leadership role and under bush has sought to play this role almost exclusively through methods of coercive domination _meta_end_dot_

 under those circumstances of course america s sins and flaws look exaggerated _meta_end_dot_

 we can write self congratulatory newspaper columns whining about this or else we can try to put our policies and our position in the geopolitical structure on a more sustainable basis _meta_end_dot_

 somehow i don t think the whining option is going to do anyone much good _meta_end_dot_

 greenwald has more on this that s valuable _meta_end_dot_
