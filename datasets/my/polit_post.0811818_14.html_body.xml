  here s terry mcauliffe in his book explaining his own personal role in the delegitimation of the michigan primary that he now decries i m going outside the primary window michigan sen _meta_end_dot_

 carl levin told me definitively _meta_end_dot_

 if i allow you to do that the whole system collapses i said _meta_end_dot_

 we will have chaos _meta_end_dot_

 i let you make your case to the dnc and we voted unanimously and you lost he kept insisting that they were going to move up michigan on their own even though if they did that they would lose half their delegates _meta_end_dot_

 by that point carl and i were leaning toward each other over a table in the middle of the room shouting and dropping the occasional expletive _meta_end_dot_

 you won t deny us seats at the convention he said _meta_end_dot_

 carl take it to the bank i said _meta_end_dot_

 they will not get a credential _meta_end_dot_

 the closest they ll get to boston will be watching it on television _meta_end_dot_

 i will not let you break this entire nominating process for one state _meta_end_dot_

 the rules are the rules _meta_end_dot_

 if you want to call my bluff carl you go ahead and do it this kind of thing is why when you see michigan featuring in a clinton campaign account of something or other you shouldn t take it very seriously _meta_end_dot_
