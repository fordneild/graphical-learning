  the air force wants more of these extremely expensive planes but the whole thing is totally unnecessary _meta_end_dot_

 but hey it s not like we have any kind of security related missions ongoing that require large numbers of a completely different kind of military and diplomatic resources so why worry about this stuff _meta_end_question_

 and of course beyond the pure waste of funds there s the risk of a self fulfilling prophesy _meta_end_dot_

 the more we give in to defense contractors and build pointless weapons systems while yelling china threat _meta_end_exclamation_

 china threat the more likely it becomes that people in beijing are going to start saying holy crap look at this giant anti chinese defense build up the americans are undertaking then you ve got arms races mutual suspicion regional conflict etc _meta_end_dot_

 it s all bad news _meta_end_dot_

 unless you make very expensive military aircraft for a living that is in which case it s great _meta_end_dot_
