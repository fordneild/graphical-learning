  hezbollah stages what looked like the opening blows in a coup in lebanon but then seem to have stopped short of that and the lebanese capital had mostly returned to calm on friday morning though hezbollah and its allies still closed down the television station and newspaper and political offices of mr _meta_end_dot_

 hariri the leader of the largest bloc in parliament and handed them over to the lebanese army over the past year or so i ve heard various voices try to propagate revisionist accounts of israel s short lived effort to crush hezbollah in lebanon where people tried to argue that the mission was only an apparent failure but actually succeeded in some sense _meta_end_dot_

 i think we can see from events like this that that s total nonsense hezbollah is very much not crushed _meta_end_dot_
