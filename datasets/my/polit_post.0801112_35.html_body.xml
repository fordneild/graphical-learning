  contemplating the prospect of a bill richardson vice presidential nomination ed kilgore remarks richardson s handicap in the veepstakes ironically is part of what made him interesting as a presidential candidate his latino identity _meta_end_dot_

 would the first female or first african american presidential nominee really want to double down by selecting the first latino vice presidential candidate _meta_end_question_

 it s doubtful though by no means impossible _meta_end_dot_

 sentiment against a double down ticket seems strong in this town but i think it would make perfect sense for obama to try to re enforce his message of change and transcendence by picking a red state woman governor like kathleen sebelius or janet napolitano as his running mate _meta_end_dot_

 for clinton it s harder to see the case for doubling down since it doesn t have the same kind of harmony with her message _meta_end_dot_

 at the same time whatever sexist assumptions people may have about the ability of a women to do the job aren t really going to be alleviated by having a white man in the number two spot so i don t see huge harm _meta_end_dot_
