 bush admits to abc news that he was knowingly lying to the public about conditions in iraq all throughout _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 he says he was doing it to keep up morale for the troops in the field _meta_end_dot_

 phil carter who was serving in iraq at the time is unimpressed by this observing that the troops in the field knew perfectly well what was going on and their morale was undermined by an out of touch leadership _meta_end_dot_

 both phil and kevin seem a bit too delicate to note that the president even in his admission of past lying is pretty clearly coming up with a new lie here _meta_end_dot_

 he wasn t pretending things were going well in iraq for the troops he was doing it for the midterm elections _meta_end_dot_
