  is it really true as a recent gallup poll has indicated that _meta_number_ref_ percent of clinton backers and _meta_number_ref_ percent of obama backers would vote for john mccain _meta_end_question_

 basically logic indicates that probably not and now via mori dinauer we ve got some evidence from brian schaffner in march of that year the pew center for the people the press released a report titled bush pays price for primary victory following bush s victory in the _meta_number_ref_ primaries and mccain s exit from the race the pew survey found that _meta_percent_ref_ of those who backed mccain during the primary campaign would vote for gore in the general election _meta_end_dot_

 only _meta_percent_ref_ of his supporters said that they would be casting their votes for bush _meta_end_dot_

 furthermore a significant share of bradley supporters also said that they would be supporting bush in the general election including _meta_percent_ref_ of his independent backers _meta_end_dot_

 no doubt there will in fact be some people clinton supporters who are serious foreign policy hawks or some newly minted obama supporters who ve never been involved in the political process before who ll defect for mccain if their favorite democrat wins but one should expect this to be a pretty small number of people _meta_end_dot_
