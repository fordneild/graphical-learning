  a bit lost in my case for mitt romney was my offhand comparison of mike huckabee to greg stillson _meta_end_dot_

 but it is worth saying that huckabee though an amusing sideshow as a sideshow is also a frightening prospect to contemplate as a potential nationwide political force _meta_end_dot_

 and frankly it just gets worse _meta_end_dot_

 check out for example new huckabee advisor jim pinkerton s explain to david corn that we ought to put a cop in front of every mosque in america i also saw on tv last night that huckabee s going beyond his new restrictionist line on illegal immigration to start talking about a broader crackdown on immigration in general another pinkerton signature _meta_end_dot_

 plus huckabee wants to change the constitution to make it accord more closely with the bible _meta_end_dot_

 it s scary stuff _meta_end_dot_
