  i d known that in the modern period just five states texas virginia oklahoma florida and missouri were responsible for some huge proportion of total executions see map and that in general the death penalty is obviously being applied very differently from place to place _meta_end_dot_

 but adam liptak points out that in _meta_number_ref_ texas alone accounted for _meta_number_ref_ percent of total executions in the united states _meta_end_dot_

 i used to be a death penalty proponent _meta_end_dot_

 and i still think in principle that it s not always wrong to execute people _meta_end_dot_

 but at the systems level actually existing capital punishment in the united states is clearly a mess _meta_end_dot_

 your odds of dying for your crime have much much much more to do with where you committed your crime and your socioeconomic status than anything about the nature of your crime _meta_end_dot_

 in theory i think you could have a fair system that involved some number of executions _meta_end_dot_

 in practice though it barely seems doable and harry blackmun s conclusion that he had to simply refuse to tinker with the machinery of death seems more and more sensible to me as time goes on _meta_end_dot_
