  i wanted to know whether or not there was any meaningful correlation between pace and offensive or defensive efficiency and dave berri kindly ran the numbers for me and came up with the answer no _meta_end_dot_

 obviously teams that choose to play fast will end up in a lot of high scoring games while teams that play slow will end up in a lot of low scoring ones but playing fast doesn t actually compromise the quality of your defense and shifting to a run and gun doesn t promise to help your team score _meta_end_dot_
