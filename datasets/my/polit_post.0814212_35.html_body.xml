  looks like lebanon s political factions have reaches a deal that s okay with hezbollah and may pave the way to relieve the atmosphere of crisis that s been gripping the country _meta_end_dot_

 i meant to link yesterday to an excellent point fareed zakaria made about hezbollah hizbullah is not like al qaeda a rootless organization that engages solely in existential terrorism _meta_end_dot_

 it s a homegrown group with deep roots in lebanon s shia community _meta_end_dot_

 the organization was formed to oppose israel s _meta_number_ref_ invasion of lebanon and still derives some of its appeal from that history of resistance _meta_end_dot_

 it s since become the voice of the shia community which is institutionally discriminated against in the country s power structures _meta_end_dot_

 shiites make up between _meta_number_ref_ and _meta_number_ref_ percent of the lebanese population yet are accorded only _meta_number_ref_ percent of parliamentary seats finally hizbullah runs an impressive network of social services which provide health care small loans and family support _meta_end_dot_

 right _meta_end_dot_

 americans because of our own situation tend to look at hezbollah primarily through the lens of its attitude toward israel to its attacks on u s _meta_end_dot_

 troops in the early _meta_number_ref_s and to its relationship with iran _meta_end_dot_

 but to lebanese shiites the primarily interesting thing about hezbollah is its attitude toward lebanon a country where political institutions structurally disenfranchise shiite voters _meta_end_dot_

 and because political institutions disenfranchise shiite voters government social services are undersupplied to shiites communities _meta_end_dot_

 hezbollah both fills the void in terms of direct provision of social services and through its lawless behavior and unwillingness to operate like a normal member of the lebanese political process stands up for the interests of a community that s structurally disadvantaged by the process _meta_end_dot_

 talk of democracy in lebanon needs to be put in this context _meta_end_dot_

 the pro western march _meta_number_ref_ coalition is not for example pro democracy in the sense of favoring moves toward a fair voting system _meta_end_dot_

 but under the circumstances it s hardly surprising if lebanese shiites decide that they don t really need democracy _meta_end_dot_
