  i m on a conference call right now with minnesota senator amy klobuchar who s announcing her endorsement of barack obama _meta_end_dot_

 in an interesting effort to change the tone of the campaign she started out by emphasizing that she believes the democratic party is truly blessed this year with two presidents who would each be a strong president and declined an invitation from david corn to condemn clinton for continuing her campaign _meta_end_dot_

 she just likes obama better _meta_end_dot_

 in particular she says obama has inspired an enthusiasm and idealism that we haven t seen in this country in a long time and recalls that back in _meta_number_ref_ obama came to minnesota several times during my own campaign for the senate and even then we saw the incredible enthusiasm he could generate in terms of specific issues she spoke about obama s leadership on ethics reform following the _meta_number_ref_ election _meta_end_dot_

 she recalled that she actually spoke with barack about the issue on the phone as she was driving across country to washington after the election and talked about ethics reform and then got a bunch of freshman senators together on a conference call on the issue _meta_end_dot_

 a lot of the democrats who won in _meta_number_ref_ regarded ethics issues as having been crucial to their victory and were frustrated by the fact that many longstanding democratic legislators weren t so keen on pushing it later _meta_end_dot_

 obama as someone who d just been elected in the previous cycle helped build bridges across that divide and make sure that something happened _meta_end_dot_

 klobuchar also noted obama s work on the risks of lead in kids toys as just another example of where he took on an issue that was ahead of its time
