  it continues to be a bit baffling that john mccain decided last week that specific mastery of policy was the grounds on which he wants to pick a fight with barack obama _meta_end_dot_

 check this out from dave roberts speaking of obama he went after mccain on climate change and he did so specifically on the basis of supporting _meta_percent_ref_ permit auctions _meta_end_dot_

 that s a somewhat subtle marker to those who don t know much about the issue and it s going to take time to massage it into the body media _meta_end_dot_

 it is fantastic that obama s getting started _meta_end_dot_

 speaking of mccain he said he hadn t seen obama s climate plan clearly an issue he cares deeply about and continued to deny that his cap and trade program included a mandatory cap _meta_end_dot_

 he could be lying or he could be confused about the policy it s hard to think of what the third option might be _meta_end_dot_

 that s right _meta_end_dot_

 john mccain doesn t know whether or not his own global warming plan puts a cap on carbon emissions _meta_end_dot_

 it s almost as if he signed on to a climate bill just because he s a camera hog and it seemed like a sexy topic and he in fact has no understanding of or commitment to the issue _meta_end_dot_
