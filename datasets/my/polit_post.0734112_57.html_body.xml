  via brad delong tanta s detailed explanation of the bush mortgage adjustment plan suggests that there s less to it than meets the eye from what i have seen about the plan to date it is clear to me that it is in fact structured with the overarching goal of making sure that it stays on the allowable side of the existing contracts _meta_end_dot_

 i proceed from the assumption that nobody could write such a convoluted and counter intuitive plan if that wasn t the goal _meta_end_dot_

 so everyone who is thinking gee we re violating contracts and we still don t get much out of it is thinking the wrong thing in my view _meta_end_dot_

 it s more like gee we don t get much out of it when we don t violate contracts meanwhile felx salmon explains why lenders love the mortgage freeze plan so it seems that the administration has its priorities straight as usual that s sarcasm _meta_end_dot_
