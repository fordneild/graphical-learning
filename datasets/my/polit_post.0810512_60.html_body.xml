  richard florida says the future of the economy is in mega regions linked up networks of cities _meta_end_dot_

 paul krugman is a skeptic but florida responds to some of his criticisms here _meta_end_dot_

 when titans clash i think of a more trivial point to raise non trivial point environmental sustainability should be considered here namely that i don t understand why florida calls these things mega regions _meta_end_dot_

 the so called mega region in which i live florida calls it bosnywash i think while krugman uses the more felicitous term acelaland is geographically smaller than a traditional region like new england or the pacific northwest _meta_end_dot_

 the true mega regions of the united states are longstanding geographic and cultural concepts like the south that are composed of distinct sub regions and are much much larger than florida s multi focal urban clusters _meta_end_dot_
