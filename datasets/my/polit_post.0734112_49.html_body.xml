  i m surprised yesterday s robert samuelson column hasn t come in for more derision we need to have a candid debate about health care in _meta_number_ref_ but the odds are against it _meta_end_dot_

 the fact that covering the _meta_number_ref_ million uninsured already looms as the centerpiece of this debate is a warning sign that it won t be serious _meta_end_dot_

 we re told that the uninsured are our biggest health care problem but they aren t _meta_end_dot_

 runaway health spending is _meta_end_dot_

 yowza _meta_end_dot_

 it seems to me that what our biggest health care problem is probably has a little something to do with who we are _meta_end_dot_

 evidently the plight of the uninsured isn t a big problem for robert samuelson but it s a problem for an awful lot of the uninsured people _meta_end_dot_

 similarly the risk of losing insurance is a problem for an awful lot of people _meta_end_dot_

 maybe if we all got paid samuelson s salary to churn out inane columns everyone would share his perspective on the world _meta_end_dot_

 but it s really a bizarre perspective _meta_end_dot_

 he moans these proposals would inflict pain and candidates who embraced them would invite political ruin pain would invite ruin because people don t like policies that will make them worse off _meta_end_dot_

 it s a perfectly reasonable thing for voters to want to avoid _meta_end_dot_
