  commenting on my post about single sex education rku snarks didn t matt just do a posting yesterday strongly implying that any claim of an innate statistical difference in female male mental psychological behavior was sexist _meta_end_question_

 this seems to be a favorite tactic of the right _meta_end_dot_

 apparently if i m going to favorably cite someone as saying that boys and girls are on average at different levels of lanugage and motor development when they enter school then i also can t object to writing op eds that argue without evidence that women are stupider than men _meta_end_dot_

 because clearly either you re a die hard egalitarian blank slater or else it s no fair objecting to sexism _meta_end_dot_

 the flaw here should be clear _meta_end_dot_

 yes boys and girls are on average different but no cutting edge neuroscience does not back up all your long held prejudices _meta_end_dot_
