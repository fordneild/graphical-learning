  a fascinating point from david corn who notes that in john mccain s vision of _meta_number_ref_ he doesn t say anything whatsoever about hot button social issues _meta_end_dot_

 i assume john paul stevens won t still be on the supreme court by then so as long as mccain is forecasting the future it really would be nice if he could say something about whether or not he believes abortion will still be legal in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_
