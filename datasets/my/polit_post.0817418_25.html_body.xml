  i mentioned douglas blackmon s excellent book slavery by another name the re enslavement of black americans from the civil war to world war ii once before and i m glad to learn that bill moyers featured it on his show recently _meta_end_dot_

 here s a bit of the transcript douglas blackmon vagrancy _meta_end_dot_

 so vagrancy was a law that essentially it simply you were breaking the law if you couldn t prove at any given moment that you were employed _meta_end_dot_

 well in a world in which there were no pay stubs it was impossible to prove you were employed _meta_end_dot_

 the only way you could prove employment was if some man who owned land would vouch for you and say he works for me _meta_end_dot_

 and of course none of these laws said it only applies to black people _meta_end_dot_

 but overwhelmingly they were only enforced against black people _meta_end_dot_

 and many times thousands of times i believe you had young black men who attempted to do that _meta_end_dot_

 they ended up being arrested and returned to the original farmer where they worked in chains not even a free worker but as a slave _meta_end_dot_

 bill moyers and the result as you write thousands of black men were arrested charged with whatever jailed and then sold to plantations railroads mills lumber camps and factories in the deep south _meta_end_dot_

 and this went on you say right up to world war ii _meta_end_question_

 douglas blackmon and it was everywhere in the south _meta_end_dot_

 these forced labor camps were all over the place _meta_end_dot_

 the records that still survive buried in courthouses all over the south make it abundantly clear that thousands and thousands of african americans were arrested on completely specious claims made up stuff and then purely because of this economic need and the ability of sheriffs and constables and others to make money off arresting them and that providing them to these commercial enterprises and being paid for that _meta_end_dot_

 it s a fascinating book and does a lot to put contemporary issues in an important but essentially forgotten context _meta_end_dot_
