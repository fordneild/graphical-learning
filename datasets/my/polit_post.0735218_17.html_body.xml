  i somehow doubt that david brooks glowing endorsement of barack obama will darken liberal doubts that he has what it takes to fight for progressive values _meta_end_dot_

 basically you face the same choice over and over again is obama s undeniable ability to win sympathy and praise from the more mild mannered and open minded segments of the right evidence of his internal frailty or is it evidence of his ability to build a dominant political coalition _meta_end_dot_

 it counts in a sense as evidence for either thesis _meta_end_dot_

 i ll admit that i liked obama from before i ever heard a word from him about politics or policy so obviously i m biased but i see it more in the pro obama way _meta_end_dot_

 at any rate maybe ed kilgore or mark kleiman will convince you _meta_end_dot_
