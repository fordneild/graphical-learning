  normally i go weeks months even at a time without anyone mentioning benjamin disraeli _meta_end_dot_

 but here s david brooks via k drum and here s the economist which is at least british and here s reihan salam _meta_end_dot_

 suddenly it seems one cannot understand contemporary politics without a sound grasp of _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_th century british prime minister benjamin disraeli _meta_end_dot_

 everyone needs a usable history but this kind of seems like a weird reach _meta_end_dot_
