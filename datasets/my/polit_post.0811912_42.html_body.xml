  brendan nyhan flags this preposterous lede _meta_number_ref_ candidates with _meta_number_ref_ financial plans but one deficit brendan thinks the problem here is a tendency toward false equivalence _meta_end_dot_

 i d say it may be simple innumeracy _meta_end_dot_

 later in the article we find out that mccain s proposals if enacted as proposed would add at least _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ trillion to the national debt over the next decade conversely even taking into account that there are some differences between the proposals by senators hillary rodham clinton and barack obama the impact of either on the deficit would be less than one third that of the mccain plan let s do some math _meta_end_dot_

 mccain s plans will at at least _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ trillion whereas the democratic plans will add less than _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ trillion to the deficit _meta_end_dot_

 the difference between them in short is at least _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ trillion _meta_end_dot_

 that obviously is a huge difference larger than the net worth of bill gates or the gdp of italy _meta_end_dot_

 there s no grounds for saying that two plans costs have something in common when they differ in cost by at least _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ trillion but to understand this you need to understand what you re talking about _meta_end_dot_

 after all if one candidate was offering budget busting on the democratic scale and another candidate was offering _meta_dollor_ref_ trillion in deficit reduction nobody would have trouble distinguishing between the budget hawk and the deficit spender _meta_end_dot_

 but the difference in magnitude is the same in either case _meta_end_dot_
