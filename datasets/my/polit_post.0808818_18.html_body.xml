  what to think of conditional engagement the brief policy memo from colin kahl and shawn brimley of cnas _meta_end_dot_

 well i m not as skeptical as kevin drum _meta_end_dot_

 in essence what i take them to be saying is that we should probably leave iraq but if upon taking office the new president finds that key iraqi politicians are all prepared to produce the pony we need then we ought to be willing to stick around _meta_end_dot_

 you can count me as very skeptical that this strategy would in fact produce a pony which is why i put emphasis on the idea of packing up our bags and going home but i don t think i disagree with their literal claim _meta_end_dot_

 now of course a lot comes down to the details _meta_end_dot_

 but beyond the details a lot comes down to the purpose here _meta_end_dot_

 do kahl and brimley really intend to quit iraq if when the pony doesn t materialize _meta_end_question_

 or is the real point here just to generate a nuanced middle position between all in or all out _meta_end_question_

 certainly i ve had about enough of policymaking where we decide first to find a nuanced middle ground and then second sketch out what that nuanced middle ground means _meta_end_dot_

 it seems to me that a lot of efforts have been expended essentially with the goal of avoiding the dfh conclusion that we ought to leave iraq at all costs _meta_end_dot_

 so i m skeptical _meta_end_dot_

 but i ll be interested to see the longer version because i don t have a huge literal disagreement with what they re saying and it sounds like the new report will be a big step in my direction relative to where phased transition had positioned cnas _meta_end_dot_
