  i didn t really notice this the first time around but i feel like this sentence from obama s speech hits a dissonant note this time we want to talk about the fact that the real problem is not that someone who doesn t look like you might take your job it s that the corporation you work for will ship it overseas for nothing more than a profit so instead of worrying that people of a different ethnic group might take my job i m supposed to worry that people of a different nationality might take my job _meta_end_question_

 i understand of course why obama s beating the anti outsourcing drums _meta_end_dot_

 but there s an appealing cosmopolitanism to both his discussion of our domestic racial problems and our foreign policy problems that s at odds with this kind of talk _meta_end_dot_

 speaking of which the obama campaign seemed very excited that hillary clinton s first lady schedule indicates she attended pro nafta meetings so perhaps the great nafta debate left for dead in ohio will be making a comeback _meta_end_dot_
