  as everyone knows that the essence of sound political strategy is the development of a sister souljah moment in which you pick a fight with a rapper thus proving you re not one of those liberals i thought i might suggest project pat s tell tell tell stop snitchin as a good candidate as jeremy kahn wrote in the april atlantic this kind of thing is becoming a real impediment to efforts to create a safe environment for poor and working class inner city neighborhoods police and prosecutors have been contending with reluctant witnesses for decades _meta_end_dot_

 but according to law enforcement experts the problem is getting dramatically worse and is reflected in falling arrest and conviction rates for violent crimes _meta_end_dot_

 in cities with populations between half a million for example tucson and a million detroit the proportion of violent crimes cleared by an arrest dropped from about _meta_number_ref_ percent in the late _meta_number_ref_s to less than _meta_number_ref_ percent in _meta_number_ref_ according to the fbi _meta_end_dot_

 conviction rates have similarly dropped _meta_end_dot_

 at the same time crime has spiked _meta_end_dot_

 murder rates have risen more or less steadily since _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 last december the fbi voiced concern over a jump in violent crime which in _meta_number_ref_ showed its biggest increase in more than a decade _meta_end_dot_

 the reasons for witnesses reluctance appear to be changing and becoming more complex with the police confronting a new cultural phenomenon the spread of the gangland code of silence or omerta from organized crime to the population at large _meta_end_dot_

 those who cooperate with the police are labeled snitches or rats terms once applied only to jailhouse informants or criminals who turned state s evidence but now used for civilian witnesses as well _meta_end_dot_

 this is particularly true in the inner cities where gangsta culture has been romanticized through rap music and other forms of entertainment and where the motto stop snitching expounded in hip hop lyrics and emblazoned on caps and t shirts has become a creed _meta_end_dot_

 it s a fun song though _meta_end_dot_
