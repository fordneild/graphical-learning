  mark helprin had one of those let s bomb sudan and everyone who doesn t want to do so immediately is obviously complicit in genocide in darfur op eds the other day _meta_end_dot_

 the trouble as mark goldberg from un dispatch points out is that this is completely detached from the nature of the problem in darfur which wouldn t at all be solved even if the sudanese government was persuaded by air strikes to withdraw its forces from the arena _meta_end_dot_

 what s needed to provide security are actual boots on the ground that can do some good and so far the only organizations willing to take on this challenge are the african union and un peacekeeping which helprin dismisses as a camping trip to the tower of babble now mark s far too polite to point this out but what you re seeing once again is that there s a certain set of people for whom darfur is an interesting situation just insofar as it provides a venue for un bashing and a more bombs would make the world awesome worldview _meta_end_dot_

 it s obviously frustrating to contemplate how unsatisfactory current un and au efforts in sudan have been but the reality is that they ve done much more good than anything else _meta_end_dot_

 the idea that if we would just cast off these shackles of multilateralism that an excellent solution is just around the corner is daft _meta_end_dot_
