  in a better world we d be past the debate over whether to enact legislation to curb america s carbon emissions and we could all spend our time glorying in things like peter orszag s recommendations on how to structure and implement a cap and trade scheme so as to maximize the room for economic growth and avoid doing anything that s unduly regressive _meta_end_dot_

 he says the two most important points are a that we need to allow for some banking and borrowing of emissions permits so that reductions can happen at the most economically opportune times rather than on an arbitrary schedule and b that we need to auction the permits so as to generate revenue that can offset some of the problems caused by the imposition of the cap _meta_end_dot_
