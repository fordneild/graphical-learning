  to back up something josh marshall s been pounding the idea that there s something unfair about the out of context use of john mccain s line about being willing to stay in iraq for _meta_number_ref_ or _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ years is pretty silly _meta_end_dot_

 obviously it s hard to quote anyone or refer to anything without taking it a bit out of context _meta_end_dot_

 but the context in which mccain is saying this stuff is a context in which mccain genuinely believes that there is no level of resources which would be too great for the united states to invest in his futile quest for some ephemeral concept of victory in iraq _meta_end_dot_

 there s no amount of money that s too much to spend there s no amount of time that s too long and there s no amount of american deaths that s too many _meta_end_dot_

 of course mccain hopes it doesn t take _meta_number_ref_ to achieve that end state _meta_end_dot_

 but since his vision of the end state is utterly unrealistic and includes a fantasy vision in which we peacefully organize a _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ basing agreement or something it might as well _meta_end_dot_

 clearly in a literal sense president mccain can t commit us to anything more than eight years of additional war in iraq but he s given us no indication that he would pull out any sooner than that and no reason to believe he can succeed any faster than that _meta_end_dot_

 maybe the dnc and the rnc can reach some kind of agreement in which both parties stipulate that we won t discuss the year _meta_number_ref_ but mccain will admit that he ll gladly have our troops still fighting in iraq in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 but probably not _meta_end_dot_

 and so as long as the hawks persist in not presenting to the public what they re actually talking about the doves are going to have to use the footage available which is mccain talking about _meta_number_ref_ or _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ rather than eight to make the point that in their more candid moments the hawks do concede that they re talking about a long hard slog in iraq _meta_end_dot_
