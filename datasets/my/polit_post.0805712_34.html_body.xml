  i think hillary clinton s major foreign policy address from yesterday is pretty good _meta_end_dot_

 the key implicit critique of obama the symbol of our presidency the american eagle holds arrows in one talon and an olive branch in the other _meta_end_dot_

 both are symbolic tools of what we need to keep our democracy strong and our nation safe tools that a president must know how to use in the daily course of events but also when that _meta_number_ref_ a m _meta_end_dot_

 phone call comes to the white house because an unforeseen crisis has erupted without warning _meta_end_dot_

 in that split second the president has to respond and make a decision that could affect the safety and lives of millions of people here in our country and around the world _meta_end_dot_

 whoever sits at that desk in the oval office on january _meta_number_ref_th _meta_number_ref_ needs all the tools available all the resources at our disposal and the wisdom to know how to use them _meta_end_dot_

 this sometimes gets lost in the heat of a campaign but i really do think barack obama s lack of administrative or executive experience is problematic _meta_end_dot_

 i don t find hillary clinton s claims on her own behalf in this regard nearly as convincing as she does but it is a real problem with his candidacy _meta_end_dot_

 still as we get down to a choice of two people i do think this line of argument runs smack into the brick wall of the _meta_number_ref_ iraq vote _meta_end_dot_

 do i worry that obama might screw up _meta_end_question_

 yes _meta_end_dot_

 does voting for the woman who got the single most important call of her legislative career wrong seem like a reasonable alternative course of action _meta_end_question_

 not really _meta_end_dot_

 this sort of hangs like a cloud over a lot of the speech s best moments on my first day in office i will announce as i have repeatedly in this campaign that the era of cowboy diplomacy is over _meta_end_dot_

 that includes the doctrine of pre emptive war _meta_end_dot_

 i have been against that for many years _meta_end_dot_

 i like these words _meta_end_dot_

 i m against the doctrine of pre emptive war too _meta_end_dot_

 but this is the woman who when casting a vote to authorize a preemptive really preventive military invasion of iraq said my vote is not however a vote for any new doctrine of pre emption or for unilateralism or for the arrogance of american power or purpose under the circumstances it s hard to know what her opposition is supposed to amount to _meta_end_dot_

 it especially in combination with a refusal to deal with the issue directly and clearly leaves me confused not understanding who i m supposed to be voting for _meta_end_dot_

 but all that is at it were external to the text at hand _meta_end_dot_

 what s on the page here is very good including a very thoughtful take on the diplomacy with adversaries issue and a strong statement about the need to avoid the many false choices with which the bush administration has sought to present people _meta_end_dot_
