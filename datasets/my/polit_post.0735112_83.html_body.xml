  the most recent cbs nyt poll asked people from what you know about the u s _meta_end_dot_

 involvement in iraq how much longer would you be willing to have large numbers of u s _meta_end_dot_

 troops remain in iraq less than a year one to two years two to five years or longer than five years as you can see virtually nobody in the united states wants to see american troops remain in iraq for longer than five years _meta_end_dot_

 if you put squarely to people a political and strategic choice between a long term military commitment to iraq and trying to wrap our involvement up as quickly as is feasible it wouldn t even be a close call _meta_end_dot_

 at the same time everyone who s paying close attention to what david petraeus says or what gets written on the small wars journal blog or what the cool kids in the think tanks are saying or what the counterinsurgency field manual says understands that the current strategy envisions us being in iraq for much much longer than the _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ years that the american public seems willing to contemplate _meta_end_dot_

 in other words completely apart from the question of whether or not the surge is working the architects of the surge understand themselves to be engaged in an undertaking setting the stage for over a decade of intensive northern ireland style policing and reconstruction of iraqi society that public opinion overwhelmingly and correctly believes to be an unacceptable allocation of national priorities _meta_end_dot_

 and yet this fact is being kept pretty well obscured from the american public _meta_end_dot_

 part of the fault there lies with the press _meta_end_dot_

 but a big part of the fault lies with the opposition party which is simply declining to present the public with a clear strategic alternative _meta_end_dot_

 the nit picking over whether the fact that conditions in december _meta_number_ref_ are more like those of december _meta_number_ref_ unbearably shitty or more like those of december _meta_number_ref_ merely awful pales in comparison to the fundamental choice of whether our troops should come home within the next year or two as the american people want or whether they should stay in iraq for an indefinite period of time definitely lasting over ten years as the current strategy indicates _meta_end_dot_

 it s not a difficult point to make rhetorically or conceptually but it would require the opposition party to actually put the let s not stay forever alternative clearly on the table and stop mucking around with half measures residual forces phased transitions and all the rest _meta_end_dot_

 you rarely get _meta_number_ref_ percent of the public agreeing on anything but it s right there over _meta_number_ref_ percent of the public rejects the idea of a military operation in iraq lasting more than five years _meta_end_dot_

 meanwhile the people leading the current operation are talking about it lasting at least nine or ten years _meta_end_dot_

 petraeus is to be commended for his honest and sober minded assessment of the challenges on that score and it s genuinely not his job to say whether or not it s a good idea to make that kind of commitment to iraq _meta_end_dot_

 but it s not a good idea and the people whose job it is to make that decision the politicians in short ought to say so and move to cut this thing off _meta_end_dot_
