  spencer ackerman has a big ol feature on the recent history of cia interrogations putting the use of brutal and illegal contexts in broader context _meta_end_dot_

 specifically putting them in the broader context of the fact that the cia actually has very little experience with interrogations and with best practices involved in doing them correctly _meta_end_dot_

 consequently you have an equation that involves people who don t really know what they re doing working under intense pressure with little practical constraint and faced with an objectively difficult task torture is the result _meta_end_dot_

 what isn t the result is much in the way of usable intelligence _meta_end_dot_

 specifically there s no way to tell what s accurate and what s not many interrogators today are in fact concerned about that _meta_end_dot_

 but the program that developed within the central intelligence agency after _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ has left the intelligence community playing a fateful role _meta_end_dot_

 surprising as it may be the cia has never really been in the interrogation business _meta_end_dot_

 after _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ it turned its back on its own limited history of interrogations and never consulted those in the u s _meta_end_dot_

 with solid experience in that difficult art _meta_end_dot_

 even in the seven years since it has built an interrogation capability mostly from scratch the agency has never applied the best practices in behavioral science to improve its regimen _meta_end_dot_

 the result has been to privilege brutality out of ignorance which according to many experts and insiders interviewed means that interrogation practices that produce faulty information are now at the very heart of the u s _meta_end_dot_

 efforts against a mysterious and still unfamiliar enemy _meta_end_dot_

 those with intimate knowledge of the program say that in many cases u s _meta_end_dot_

 interrogators haven t even been able to learn the basics about many of those they hold or have held to say nothing of whatever crucial information they possess _meta_end_dot_

 how do you separate the sheep from the wool _meta_end_question_

 there s no fingerprints no dna said a former senior intelligence official who helped set up the cia s interrogation program and who would not speak for attribution _meta_end_dot_

 you don t know if you have osama bin laden or joe shit the rag man worse than a crime to paraphrase tallyrand interrogation by the cia has been and remains a blunder _meta_end_dot_

 i had always thought it was worse than a crime it was a mistake was something joseph fouch said and his background in the secret police is more apropos given the subject of the article but besides that it s an absolutely excellent piece _meta_end_dot_

 one area of inquiry that for now must remain shrouded in mystery and speculation is to what extent the problems with this approach are precisely what made them appealing to bush _meta_end_dot_

 the us government has after all plenty of agencies who interrogate prisoners routinely and lots of interrogations have been done historically _meta_end_dot_

 if i had been president i would have tasked such agencies with the new job _meta_end_dot_

 that would have resulted in non physical non coercive techniques like building rapports with detainees much like the fbi does and much like what worked _meta_number_ref_ years ago at places like fort hunt against hardened sadistic nazi officers and it wouldn t have even resulted in that outcome because i m an especially humane kind of guy _meta_end_dot_

 it s just that that is in fact what the fbi does and what the military did when it had to interrogate nazis etc _meta_end_dot_

 that s the process the process works and it doesn t raise any moral or legal qualms so it s all good _meta_end_dot_

 why on earth would i turn to the cia and have them re invent the wheel _meta_end_question_

 well i suppose bush might have if deep down he s just the sort of person who likes the idea of torture and brutality someone who at some level would be disappointed to hear an agency official not respond to _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ by immediately requesting permission to start torturing people _meta_end_dot_

 but whatever the reason it s just a huge huge huge mistake _meta_end_dot_

 just as with surveillance policy the bush administration seems incapable of processing the idea that a certain level of formal constraint on what the security services are allowed to do may be necessary to make them work properly _meta_end_dot_

 instead the underlying presumption seems to be that transparency the rule of law accountability etc _meta_end_dot_

 are all incredibly weaknesses in a system of government and that liberal democracies have been prevailing for the past couple of centuries despite the integral features of such a political system rather than because of them _meta_end_dot_
