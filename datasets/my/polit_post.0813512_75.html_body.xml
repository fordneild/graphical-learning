  becks at unfogged reads heads in the sand and asks questions so i ve been reading heads in the sand by one matthew yglesias in stores now and a lot of the book is about the liberal case for intervention in places like bosnia which got me thinking why hasn t the case been made for the un invading myanmar _meta_end_question_

 if there s one place where i think people would be greeting us with cheers and flowers in the street as liberators that would be it _meta_end_dot_

 it might not be genocide per se but the evil going on there rises to that level _meta_end_dot_

 realistically you re not going to see a forceful u n _meta_end_dot_

 intervention in burma because no country capable of mounting such an operation basically the u s _meta_end_dot_

 and maybe britain and france would want to mount one while russia and china and probably even post colonial democracies like india would be opposed to anyone mounting one and democratic countries would be secretly glad that russia and china would block a move like this because they could blame inaction on russia and china or like fred hiatt toss blame vaguely in the direction of the u n for a domestic audience even though they wouldn t want to step in themselves _meta_end_dot_

 that said if you could sort of bracket the logistics will capabilities issues with any proposed humanitarian military intervention i ve come to think that we need to think seriously about two issues legitimacy and sustainability _meta_end_dot_

 we really might be greeted by the burmese as liberators _meta_end_dot_

 but then again many iraqis actually did greet us as liberators _meta_end_dot_

 the trouble is what happens the day after you re greeted as a liberator _meta_end_dot_

 an occupying foreign power is naturally going to come to be viewed with suspicion by the occupied _meta_end_dot_

 this is in many ways an intrinsic problem but it can be ameliorated a lot by legitimacy especially the kind of legitimacy you get from the u n _meta_end_dot_

 where precisely because the unsc decision making process is cumbersome you can be ensured that a unsc authorization reflects a broad international consensus about the need to do something or other rather than the narrow national interest of the lead country _meta_end_dot_

 the other thing is sustainability _meta_end_dot_

 the international system needs to have some kind of recognized rules of the road _meta_end_dot_

 the united states topples foreign regimes when we decide their government is bad isn t a reasonable proposal for us to ask people in beijing moscow new delhi teheran brasilia or anywhere else to live by _meta_end_dot_

 by any large country topples any foreign regime when it decides their government is bad is a terrible rule that would lead to a lot of destructive conflict of various sorts _meta_end_dot_

 at the end of the day great power conflict even if it only takes the form of cold war style standoffs will do immense humanitarian damage to the world and avoiding it should be a very high priority _meta_end_dot_

 does that mean we should do nothing _meta_end_question_

 no it doesn t it means american officials and indeed civil society figures should keep pushing the international community to move to a world where something like the responsibility to protect has some force in the real world _meta_end_dot_

 but it has to be done in a reasonable consensual way that tries to stitch together america and its traditional allies with new emerging powers in various regions _meta_end_dot_

 otherwise even if some good is done in a particular case you re going to be on an unsustainable path of conflict _meta_end_dot_
