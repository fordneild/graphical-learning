  as tom lee points out any discussion of a project like my bike lane aimed at getting motorists to stop practices that endanger the lives of motorists inevitably cycles back to someone pointing out that cyclists sometimes misbehave as well _meta_end_dot_

 and that s true enough _meta_end_dot_

 however from a policy perspective you need to consider the costs and benefits to different weightings of priorities _meta_end_dot_

 a measure like stricter bike lane enforcement that makes life easier for bike riders and harder for car drivers has some clear environmental and public health benefits in terms of at the margin encouraging drivers to shift to walking transit or biking _meta_end_dot_

 by contrast a measure that would be convenient for drivers of private cars but inconvenient for cyclists doesn t seem to have much to recommend it _meta_end_dot_

 by contrast in a conflict between a bike and a bus the policy merits seem to lie with the bus _meta_end_dot_

 buses loading and unloading passengers are constantly interfering with the bike lanes on _meta_number_ref_th street and _meta_number_ref_th street which is annoying if you re on a bike but probably not a bad thing in a broader sense since clearly many more people fit on a bus than fit on my bike _meta_end_dot_

 the problem here is that the city has seen fit to put its two biggest north south bike lanes on two of the top three north south routes for bus frequency _meta_end_dot_

 a smarter idea would be to reduce the volume of space on those roads given to private cars and make wider bus bike lanes but unlike the alleged bus bike only lane on _meta_number_ref_th street and a part of _meta_number_ref_th street north of the mall you d actually need to enforce it which would remove the problem of buses needing to cross back and forth past the bike lane _meta_end_dot_

 bike pedestrian conflicts are similarly to be lamented _meta_end_dot_

 but the problem here is less evil cyclists encroaching on the sidewalk than the simple fact that such a huge proportion of public space in dense walkable areas is nonetheless given over to cars _meta_end_dot_

 if bikes had more space specifically dedicated to them then they wouldn t be in the way of people trying to walk around _meta_end_dot_

 go to amsterdam and you ll almost certainly have a near collision experience if you stand around in a bike lane but not otherwise because the bikes are in the bike lanes which are plentiful and well marked _meta_end_dot_
