  barack obama reaps the harvest of his campaign s idiotic decision to start releasing oppo research on paul krugman as the latter unloads on obama slamming him as the anti change candidate who s such a prisoner of his desire for good press coverage that he s ignoring a vast populist tide sweeping the country _meta_end_dot_

 krugman s spot on in his argument that what the des moines register sees as the problem with john edwards is in fact what s good about edwards _meta_end_dot_

 but i think he s let his taste for revenge understandable _meta_end_exclamation_

 i d be really pissed if i were in his position too undermine his perspective on the objective realities _meta_end_dot_

 as john edwards himself has said the most dramatic contrast between his vision of sweeping change comes from hillary clinton not obama _meta_end_dot_

 as krugman is usually at pains to point out there s more to life than campaign rhetoric people have records and so forth that can be subjected to scrutiny _meta_end_dot_

 nobody would appoint mark penn to run their political team if what they really wanted to do was lead a bold populist revival _meta_end_dot_

 similarly it s objectively true that the next president s ability to bring about big picture change in american domestic policy will be limited by his or her ability to secure republican votes for his or her agenda _meta_end_dot_

 i wish that this wasn t the way that american political institutions work but it is _meta_end_dot_

 i like edwards rhetoric about taking down a corrupt power structure a lot more than i like obama s kumbaya talk but any president will face the same institutional set up and the real limits it imposes _meta_end_dot_

 all of which is to re enforce what i said previously about voting tactically i share a lot of these concerns about obama while over time edwards has dispelled most of my concerns about his foreign policy and it s on these issues where the candidates views seem to contrast most sharply but i think either would be clearly preferable to clinton from a progressive point of view and the obama campaign s poor handling of its relationship with the country s highest profile liberal columnist shouldn t obscure that _meta_end_dot_
