  admiral fallon at centcom long seems to have been lukewarm at best about the surge so naturally just like petraeus predecessors in iraq he s going to be relieved of command _meta_end_dot_

 this is what s known in the bush administration as shaping policy by military conditions on the ground rather than arbitrary dictates in washington _meta_end_dot_

 first you formulate a policy _meta_end_dot_

 then you find some career military people who agree with it _meta_end_dot_

 then you put them in charge _meta_end_dot_

 then you hide behind them to avoid taking political heat for your own policies _meta_end_dot_

 and if they aren t good at serving as frontmen for your policies or aren t willing to do it you get some new ones _meta_end_dot_
