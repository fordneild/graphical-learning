  secdef robert gates admits that u s _meta_end_dot_

 military deaths are back on the upswing in iraq _meta_end_dot_

 mcclatchy reports that april has been the bloodiest month for americans in iraq since september with _meta_number_ref_ troops killed compared to _meta_number_ref_ in march and _meta_number_ref_ in february spencer ackerman offers analysis to make a calmer more substantive point about what we re seeing in iraq _meta_end_dot_

 the rhythm of any protracted war goes something like this you do stuff the enemy responds you adjust so does he and on and on until a point of decision is reached _meta_end_dot_

 an air force colonel named john boyd once coined a useful if jargony term for this the ooda loop where ooda stands for observation orientation decision action boyd reasoned that the initiative in war goes to he who can achieve a faster ooda loop than his enemy and who can disrupt his enemy s loop _meta_end_dot_

 at the risk of saying something disputable from _meta_number_ref_ to mid _meta_number_ref_ the insurgencies in iraq had faster ooda loops than the u s _meta_end_dot_

 did _meta_end_dot_

 that s not to say that there weren t discrete tactical successes there were and lots of them _meta_end_dot_

 but those developments are coterminous with the concept of the loop you adjust and inflict pain on the enemy but the enemy does so faster and more powerfully _meta_end_dot_

 once operation phantom thunder began in the late spring of _meta_number_ref_ lots of people on the right and on the fake left declared without using boyd s term that petraeus and odierno had finally broken the enemy s loop _meta_end_dot_

 spencer thinks instead that it was merely disrupted but the rise in u s _meta_end_dot_

 and iraqi civilian casualties demonstrates that the insurgencies loops have now closed i m not _meta_number_ref_ percent happy with that characterization more on why later but i think it does capture the important point that in war a successful tactical shift is no guarantee of strategic victory since other players get to change tactics as well _meta_end_dot_

 a broader point i would make is that one thing i was reminded of while researching and writing heads in the sand is exactly how many times we ve won the war in iraq _meta_end_dot_

 today we re celebrating mission accomplished day but that was only one of several occasions on which war skeptics were thought to have been decisively refuted _meta_end_dot_

 a similar attitude pervaded the mainstream in the wake of the capture of saddam hussein then again to a lesser extent when the occupation was declared officially over and iyad allawi put in charge and then again to a huge extent during the arab spring and then to a lesser extent when ibrahim jafari was forced out of office in favor of nouri al maliki and now again to a greater extent as a result of the surge related decline in violence _meta_end_dot_

 in every instance though the optimists have ultimately proven wrong because the united states has continued to pursue basically unachievable strategic goals in iraq _meta_end_dot_

 sometimes when the situation gets desperate the u s _meta_end_dot_

 government has proven capable of shifting our posture in order to better accommodate iraqi realities see e g bush giving in to ayatollah sistani s demand for elections but instead of building on these successes by opting for strategic retrenchment success tends to breed a new round of self defeating hubris _meta_end_dot_
