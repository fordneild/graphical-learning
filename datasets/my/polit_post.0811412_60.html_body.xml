  brad henry oklahoma governor and superdelegate endorses barack obama _meta_end_dot_

 other undeclared superdelegates should likewise state their preferences _meta_end_dot_

 if there s a large pro clinton group out there fine _meta_end_dot_

 so be it _meta_end_dot_

 stand up and let yourselves be counted _meta_end_dot_

 if not if you re for obama then even better raise your hand _meta_end_dot_

 people keep explaining to me that superdelegates have good selfish reasons to avoid declaring and giving us a chance to end this thing _meta_end_dot_

 that s true but a great many of them also have constituents on whom pressure can be brought to get off the fence without waiting until june _meta_end_dot_

 at this point we know what we need to know _meta_end_dot_

 we know the policy differences between the candidates we know the freak show issues surrounding the candidates we know the basic shape of each candidate s core electoral coalition and we know that in the end obama will have a modest but real lead in elected delegates _meta_end_dot_

 everyone should declare _meta_end_dot_
