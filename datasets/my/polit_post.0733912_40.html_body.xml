  some of the people supporting hillary clinton s campaign seem to me to be doing it because they agree with her relatively hawkish approach to foreign policy issues _meta_end_dot_

 others are supporting her for careerist reasons _meta_end_dot_

 others are supporting her because they think she has other virtues that outweigh problems with her relatively hawkish approach _meta_end_dot_

 and some people are just poorly informed _meta_end_dot_

 but there s a curious fifth faction in town whispering in peoples ears in a manner that intentionally makes it difficult to do proper journalism on the subject _meta_end_dot_

 this group has an approach to foreign policy that s very similar to my own and insists that hillary secretly agrees with us but needs to play the hawk in order to be politically viable as a woman _meta_end_dot_

 i don t really believe she s only acting nor do i really believe that such an act would be necessary but either way james fallows who s obviously heard this line as well makes the important rejoinder that this is basically irrelevant _meta_end_dot_

 if clinton believes she needs to act like a hawk on the campaign trail she ll believe the same thing while in office so either way it s trouble _meta_end_dot_
