  one thing to keep in mind about the repeated failures of our effort to train iraqi security forces is that it s always been a bit odd to think of this as a situation where more better training is actually what s needed _meta_end_dot_

 at the end of the day whatever the shortcomings of our training and equipping mission in iraq after all it s better than anything the mahdi army or the domestic sunni arab insurgency or aqi or the badr organization has _meta_end_dot_

 the issue is one of politics legitimacy motivation and leadership _meta_end_dot_

 muqtada al sadr s men aren t well trained or especially disciplined but they are fighting for a cause they believe in and that s at least a first step toward creating an effective military force _meta_end_dot_

 no american led training program is going to be able to make up for that kind of shortfall in the political legitimacy of the central government _meta_end_dot_
