  ana marie cox tries to get john mccain to expand a bit on his vision for an indefinite occupation of iraq his campaign insists that the reason he becomes so hyperbolic is to hammer home the point that our time in iraq will stop being a controversy once the killing stops _meta_end_dot_

 sure he s right about that and that s why he mentions japan germany and kuwait when rebuffing criticism _meta_end_dot_

 though it s also a weirdly obvious conclusion other than the killings america how did you like the play what frustrated me yesterday was his refusal to engage on what it would take to make the transition from an occupying force in a country torn by civil war to something less intrusive _meta_end_dot_

 and also to address the mixed feelings that iraqis greet the prospect of perpetual american presence _meta_end_dot_

 i think this shows a real inability to grasp the basic dynamics of the situation _meta_end_dot_

 i can t speak to the details of the immediate postwar period in germany and japan but it s clear that following the formal surrender of the axis militaries the occupation forces were able to very quickly establish orderly and peaceful conditions _meta_end_dot_

 within just a couple of years the dawn of the cold war shifted the main purpose of us military personnel in germany and japan away from occupation work and toward defense of those countries from the soviet threat _meta_end_dot_

 meanwhile there was never any serious doubt about the legitimacy of germany or japan as nation states _meta_end_dot_

 four and a half years after the occupation of iraq began there s just nothing about iraq _meta_number_ref_ that resembles germany or japan in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 to do what mccain does and simply assume that the natural evolution of the situation is into the sort of stability and uncontroversial presence of us troops that we see in those other countries is fatuous _meta_end_dot_
