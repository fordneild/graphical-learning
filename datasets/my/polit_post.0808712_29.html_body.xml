  with michael bloomberg introducing barack obama at obama s major speech on modernizing financial market regulation has the time come to replace pointless speculation about a bloomberg presidential bid with pointless speculation about a bloomberg vice presidential bid _meta_end_question_

 i say yes _meta_end_dot_

 what better way to balance a ticket headed by a lanky black guy from hawaii chicago than by adding a short jewish guy from boston new york _meta_end_question_

 it sounds ideal to me _meta_end_dot_

 plus if haim saban and friends follow through on their threat to cut off the flow of big checks if hillary clinton doesn t get her way bloomberg bucks could make up the difference easily _meta_end_dot_

 pointless speculation over what i d really like to see bloomberg do with his career though is invest some of his vast wealth in starting up a new policy analysis and advocacy center focused on issues of big cities and urbanism _meta_end_dot_

 outside of the sub set of urban issues that have to do with inner city education policy there s almost no investment in these issues in the policy game _meta_end_dot_

 alternatively bloomberg could leave nyc and move on to a second political career as the mayor of a more challenging city _meta_end_dot_

 he did a good job in new york but can he tackle the more serious problems of a baltimore _meta_end_question_

 a detroit _meta_end_question_

 that d be truly great mayoring _meta_end_dot_
