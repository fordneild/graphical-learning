  bob casey jr _meta_end_dot_

 doesn t make much sense to me as a potential vp pick for barack obama _meta_end_dot_

 conventional wisdom says you need to be pro choice to be on a national democratic ticket and i think that cw is correct _meta_end_dot_

 among other things i assume that in a general election obama s going to want to make the point that john paul stevens is even older than mccain so if he wins then all your reproductive freedoms are belong to sam alito _meta_end_dot_

 on top of that casey doesn t seem like an especially skilled politician _meta_end_dot_

 he has no real virtues relative to jim webb some of webb s flaws plus some additional flaws _meta_end_dot_

 so webb continues to be tempting i think sherrod brown would make a lot of sense and i also have a soft spot for the ballsy metaphorically speaking idea of janet napolitano _meta_end_dot_
