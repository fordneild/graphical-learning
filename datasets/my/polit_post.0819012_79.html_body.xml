  one issue on which barack obama and john mccain differ is social security _meta_end_dot_

 mccain would like to replace social security as we currently understand it with a very different kind of retirement program that wouldn t offer security to retirees and would have no progressive impact on the income distribution _meta_end_dot_

 because this plan is unpopular he would like to confuse people about his support for privatization of social security and he would also like to secure bipartisan cover for privatizing it _meta_end_dot_

 obama by contrast wants to keep social security very much as it is and if deficits projected for the future emerge he s interested in altering the payroll tax cap in order to secure more revenue _meta_end_dot_

 or as the headline writers put it on the front page of the washington post candidates diverge on how to save social security _meta_end_dot_

 because in headlineland saving a program and destroying a program under pretext of saving it are just two different ways of saving it _meta_end_dot_

 or as perry bacon jr _meta_end_dot_

 writes in the above headlined story sens _meta_end_dot_

 barack obama and john mccain are both proposing dramatic changes to social security taking on the financially fragile third rail of american politics that congress and recent presidents have been unable to repair _meta_end_dot_

 this is a great lead except for the fact that obama is not proposing dramatic changes to social security _meta_end_dot_

 well there s also the fact that the projected deficits for social security are smaller and more manageable than those projected for the other entitlement programs medicare and medicaid and that the non entitlement portion of the budget is running a huge deficit right now _meta_end_dot_

 under the circumstances social security would seem to be the least financial fragile aspect of the federal budget _meta_end_dot_

 and one more thing to say that congress and recent presidents have been unable to repair social security implies that recent presidents and congresses have been trying to repair it when in fact george w _meta_end_dot_

 bush s social security proposals were like john mccain s aimed at phasing the program out _meta_end_dot_

 i think i m afraid to read past the lede of that particular story _meta_end_dot_
