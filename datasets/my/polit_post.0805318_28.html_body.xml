  conservatives have been all over barack obama here and here and here and here and here and here and here and here and here and here for telling the following anecdote during last night s debate you know i ve heard from an army captain who was the head of a rifle platoon supposed to have _meta_number_ref_ men in a rifle platoon he said _meta_end_dot_

 ended up being sent to afghanistan with _meta_number_ref_ because _meta_number_ref_ of those soldiers had been sent to iraq _meta_end_dot_

 and as a consequence they didn t have enough ammunition they didn t have enough humvees _meta_end_dot_

 they were actually capturing taliban weapons because it was easier to get taliban weapons than it was for them to get properly equipped by our current commander in chief _meta_end_dot_

 basically as you can see if you check the conservative blogs above that story can t possibly be true and the fact that obama would say it reflects either his dishonesty or else his gross ignorance of military matters _meta_end_dot_

 alternatively you can read jake tapper who got in touch with the captain in question short answer he backs up obama s story the story itself is as tapper says pretty interesting and worth checking out on its own merits _meta_end_dot_

 obama s conservative critics will i m sure be taking note of this additional reporting _meta_end_dot_

 update phil carter has an excellent post following up on some of these issues _meta_end_dot_

 bottom line in light of my experience in iraq sen _meta_end_dot_

 obama s comments last night are eminently believable _meta_end_dot_

 sen _meta_end_dot_

 obama is also absolutely right to use this anecdote as a critique of the administration s decision to go to war in iraq _meta_end_dot_

 it is incontrovertible that the war in iraq diverted scarce military resources manpower equipment etc from afghanistan to iraq _meta_end_dot_

 the cost for that diversion was paid by america s sons and daughters and our afghan brethren who continue to fight in afghanistan against the taliban and al qaeda _meta_end_dot_

 we owe our troops better _meta_end_dot_

 well said _meta_end_dot_
