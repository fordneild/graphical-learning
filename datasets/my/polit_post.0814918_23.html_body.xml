  matt i think this point has probably been made elsewhere but from a rainy day at my beachy retreat it occurs to me to point out that one really ought to look at the selection of a vice presidential nominee as something where the substantive merits are important _meta_end_dot_

 of our eleven postwar vice presidents nixon johnson humphrey agnew ford rockefeller mondale bush quayle gore and cheney four have gone on to become president and three more have gone on to become a major party presidential nominee _meta_end_dot_

 that s by no means a perfect batting record but generically speaking becoming vice president is the best means of going on to become president _meta_end_dot_

 under the circumstances it seems foolish to advocate for someone or other purely on the grounds of political expediency _meta_end_dot_

 indeed i suspect this is part of the reason that veepstakes conversations tend to get so annoying _meta_end_dot_

 much like electability controversies during presidential primary season people are playing without putting all their cards on the table and tend to coincidentally get the result that the person who they think would be the most politically savvy pick is also a substantively good choice _meta_end_dot_
