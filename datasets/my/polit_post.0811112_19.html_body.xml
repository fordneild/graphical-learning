  frank rich seems a bit bitter privileged though they are mrs _meta_end_dot_

 clinton and mr _meta_end_dot_

 obama do want to shape policy to help the less well heeled _meta_end_dot_

 mr _meta_end_dot_

 mccain who had a far more elite upbringing than either of them and whose wife s estimated fortune exceeds the clintons is not just condescending to working americans but trying to hoodwink them _meta_end_dot_

 next week in a replay of the _meta_number_ref_ bush campaign s compassionate conservative photo ops among black schoolchildren he will show he s a different kind of republican by visiting what he calls the forgotten america of alabama s black belt and the old steel town of youngstown ohio _meta_end_dot_

 what he wants voters to forget is the inequity of his new economic plan _meta_end_dot_

 that plan s incoherent smorgasbord of items includes a cut from _meta_number_ref_ percent to _meta_number_ref_ percent in the corporate tax rate _meta_end_dot_

 for noncorporate taxpayers mr _meta_end_dot_

 mccain offers such thin gruel as a battle against federal pork the notorious alaskan bridge to nowhere earmarked for _meta_dollor_ref_ million in federal highway money costs less than a day of the war in iraq and a temporary suspension of the federal gas tax a saving of some _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ per _meta_number_ref_ gallon tank _meta_end_dot_

 now there s a reason for voters to be bitter assuming bloviators start publicizing and parsing mr _meta_end_dot_

 mccain s words as relentlessly as they do the democrats _meta_end_dot_

 ultimately one suspects that it would be really really really hard for anyone involved in politics professionally for as long as a john mccain or a hillary clinton or even a barack obama to be really and truly in touch with peoples lives _meta_end_dot_

 which is what brings us back to policy priorities _meta_end_dot_

 mccains are reducing the level of government services in order to pay for an indefinite prolongation of the war in iraq the extension of bush s tax cuts for the highest income americans a large hike in non war defense spending and a series of new tax breaks _meta_end_dot_

 clinton and obama are both in somewhat different ways offering more services paid for by returning to something more like the levels of taxation that so devastated the national economy in the _meta_number_ref_s _meta_end_dot_
