  it s been objected that i should actually make an argument about nafta on the merits rather than simply assert that i think it was a good idea _meta_end_dot_

 i didn t do it because this is one of the most well trod over subjects in our political debate and i don t think i have a ton of original contributions to make _meta_end_dot_

 this paper makes some important points that go beyond a simplistic analysis of economic trends in mexico and i largely follow brad delong on such matters _meta_end_dot_

 as i said in the original post i think it s clear that nafta was oversold during the initial debate when both sides started making wildly overblown claims about the likely impact of the deal on the united states _meta_end_dot_

 i m not moreover one to run around going oh noes politicians are trying to secure votes by appealing to manufacturing workers interests since i don t really know what else they re supposed to do _meta_end_dot_

 that said it s simply not the case that u s _meta_end_dot_

 trade policy is the cause of the structural decline of american manufacturing _meta_end_dot_

 it s mostly been driven by other factors and lowered trade barriers have made most americans better off _meta_end_dot_

 what s more insofar as nafta was intended to improve the u s mexico geopolitical relationship and help consolidate moves toward political reform in mexico it seems to have been a success _meta_end_dot_

 the correct solution to the inequality boosting elements of lowering trade barriers with low wage countries is higher taxes and better public services these proposals from dean baker for freer trade in high end professional services are also a good idea _meta_end_dot_
