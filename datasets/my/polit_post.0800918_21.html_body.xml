  one element of george w _meta_end_dot_

 bush s rise to power that tends to be forgotten in retrospect is that republicans were really looking in _meta_number_ref_ for someone who though solidly conservative didn t have a conservative voting record _meta_end_dot_

 under newt gingrich after all the congressional gop tried to implement conservatism and the voters didn t like it _meta_end_dot_

 but before john mccain was a maverick he was an orthodox republican senator and he lived through the whole thing _meta_end_dot_

 if he becomes the gop nominee when the democrats go through his voting record they ll find all the greatest hits from the _meta_number_ref_ re election campaign stuff about _meta_dollor_ref_ billion in medicare cuts and tens of thousands of senior citizens forced into poverty _meta_end_dot_

 that s ancient history now so in some ways the impact will be blunted _meta_end_dot_

 but still any long serving senator faces some real risks in having random elements of his voting record dragged back out during the campaign and as best anyone can tell rabid opposition to government services actually is something mccain believes in _meta_end_dot_

 how will that play out in the end _meta_end_question_

 it s hard to say _meta_end_dot_

 but the essence of mccain s strength in the polls right now is that for years he s been attacked by the right as insufficiently loyal and sporadically praised by democrats as a valued collaborator _meta_end_dot_

 if he wins that changes and we start hearing about a whole other side of mccain s record _meta_end_dot_
