  asked how to choose a good mechanic tyler cowen responds that you should buy a honda or a toyota and you probably won t need a mechanic to do anything beyond the super routine _meta_end_dot_

 i ve never owned a car but in second hand anecdotal terms that definitely seems to be the case folks who own hondas or toyotas even pretty cheap ones rarely have problems whereas american cars are plagued with reliability issues _meta_end_dot_

 this often strikes me as an under analyzed element in the saga of american deindustrialization maybe it s not even true that american durable goods are far less reliable than japanese brands but it s certainly what a lot of people think _meta_end_dot_
