  one interesting thing about politics is that you might think that when a politician develops a reputation for honesty the way saint john of arizona has that from that day forward he needs to be super scrupulous about telling the truth _meta_end_dot_

 otherwise voters who might dismiss a small fib from a regular politician will suddenly be outraged _meta_end_dot_

 in truth the reverse is the case _meta_end_dot_

 thus mac was not only back last night but appears to have made his patently false accusation that mitt romney favored a timetable for withdrawal from iraq the centerpiece of his argument at last night s debate _meta_end_dot_

 shocking stuff _meta_end_dot_

 mccain s made this claim before everyone who s looked at it concluded that it wasn t true and so mccain _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 just did it again in a higher profile forum _meta_end_dot_

 naturally jonathan martin s politico article on the subject was given the headline romney falls into mccain trap on iraq rather than say mccain lies his ass off
