  i m not really sure that an offer to retire hillary clinton s campaign debts would have a ton of appeal to clinton _meta_end_dot_

 it seems to me that once she s out of the presidential race she ll still be a fairly influential u s _meta_end_dot_

 senator who shouldn t have much trouble raising funds from folks looking to curry favor with her and she s unlikely to face a serious _meta_number_ref_ challenge so her re election fundraising can just go to pay off presidential campaign debt _meta_end_dot_
