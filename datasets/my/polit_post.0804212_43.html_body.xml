  funny video my understanding is that it s supposed to be unfair to charge mccain with having proposed that we fight a _meta_number_ref_ or at times _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ years war in iraq because he stipulated that americans would stop getting killed via magic during this indefinite occupation _meta_end_dot_

 maybe so but viewed in that light the comment merely reflects mccain s utter lack of strategic and diplomatic understanding _meta_end_dot_

 such masters of nuance and sensitivity as george w _meta_end_dot_

 bush dick cheney and don rumsfeld all had the good sense to recognize that loose talk of perpetual american occupation of iraq drives anti american violence and gets us troops killed _meta_end_dot_
