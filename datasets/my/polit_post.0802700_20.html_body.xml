  man _meta_end_dot_

 if you d asked me yesterday to list barack obama s strengths and weaknesses i would have told you he s much more impressive giving a formal speech than on a debate stage _meta_end_dot_

 but it s doubly impressive all over again when you see him giving a big formal speech he s much better in this format _meta_end_dot_

 i somehow doubt that a broad swathe of americans are sitting at home on a saturday night though maybe in california where it s only a quarter past six but if they are i think they ll be very impressed _meta_end_dot_

 when forgotten element of this campaign is that even though obama s given several speeches that are quite well known among political junkies most voters have almost certainly never sat and watched him deliver one _meta_end_dot_
