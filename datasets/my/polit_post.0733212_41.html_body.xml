  via ezra klein some depressing research from john bullock much work on political persuasion maintains that people are influenced by information that they believe and not by information that they don t _meta_end_dot_

 by this view false beliefs have no power if they are known to be false _meta_end_dot_

 this helps to explain frequent efforts to change voters attitudes by exposing them to relevant facts _meta_end_dot_

 but findings from social psychology suggest that this view requires modification sometimes false beliefs influence people s attitudes even after they are understood to be false _meta_end_dot_

 in a trio of experiments i demonstrate that the effect is present in people s thinking about politics and amplified by party identification _meta_end_dot_

 i conclude by elaborating the consequences for theories of belief updating and strategic political communication _meta_end_dot_

 in essence if you hear that hillary clinton had vince foster murdered this lowers your opinion of her _meta_end_dot_

 if you later find out that she did not in fact do this your opinion improves _meta_end_dot_

 but not back up to its original level _meta_end_dot_

 and the effect is especially strong if you re a republican and conversely if the target of the smear is a republican _meta_end_dot_

 in essence the damage done by years of ludicrous anti clinton smears cannot be repaired even if everyone comes to know the truth and the same is true of the newer but possibly more virulent made up emails about barack obama being an america hating muslim _meta_end_dot_

 which gets at one of the less fortunate ambiguities of the past several years of progressive institution building _meta_end_dot_

 one major goal of the institution building impulse has been to more effectively counter the republican noise machine _meta_end_dot_

 the honorable and decent way to do this of course is with counterpunching efforts that identity and aggressively push back against dishonest smears _meta_end_dot_

 bullock s research indicates that while this sort of thing can be helpful it still leaves you at a structural disadvantage _meta_end_dot_

 if _meta_number_ref_ percent of the population hears your opponent s smears and then later _meta_number_ref_ percent of the population hears your debunking of the smear you still find up at a disadvantage even if everyone finds the debunking convincing _meta_end_dot_

 to be competitive in the smear wars it seems it s actually necessary to fight fire with fire and produce your own lies and distortions _meta_end_dot_

 that however doesn t make for a very good fundraising pitch especially since the best thing a fundraiser for a progressive cause can offer to a potential donor is typically a sense of enhanced self righteousness thus requiring an honorable purpose rather than anything appealing to direct material interests _meta_end_dot_
