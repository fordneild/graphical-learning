  via patrick barry max boot offers a slightly different twist on the emboldening argument just as islamist militants were emboldened by the soviet union s retreat from afghanistan in _meta_number_ref_ so they would be encouraged by our premature departure from iraq this kind of thing really needs to be taken apart _meta_end_dot_

 did the emboldened militants follow the red army home from afghanistan _meta_end_question_

 no _meta_end_dot_

 rather a few years after soviet withdrawal from afghanistan the ussr collapsed under the weight of accumulated economic problems that had been exacerbated by the long and fruitless war in afghanistan _meta_end_dot_

 now it s true that osama bin laden has been known to cite the mujahedeen s success against the soviets as evidence that his war on america is feasible _meta_end_dot_

 but to argue that mikhail gorbachev should have continued the occupation of afghanistan indefinitely in order to prevent a terrorist attack in manhattan twelve years later is absurd _meta_end_dot_

 in retrospect there are a lot of things one wishes were done differently with regard to afghanistan in the years _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ but endless soviet occupation isn t one of them _meta_end_dot_

 meanwhile it continues to astound me how focused conservative thinkers are on purely subjective factors as key influences on events in the world _meta_end_dot_

 does it really make sense to think that the main thing we should worry about is that al qaeda operatives will get bolder _meta_end_question_

 for the thousandth time they seem pretty bold already the iraq war is in an objective sense squandering american resources and degrading the operational effectiveness of the u s _meta_end_dot_

 security services while also in an objective sense bolstering al qaeda manpower _meta_end_dot_

 this sort of thing the impact of our policies on the real world seems much more important to me than the subjective emotional state of hard core killers _meta_end_dot_
