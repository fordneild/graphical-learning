  tom lee says we need to worry less about the over hyped robot threat and focus more attention on the menace of pirates _meta_end_dot_

 i m afraid however that as tom ought well know many of his precious google trends hits for pirates aren t about honest to god parrot wielding pirates at all but rather intellectual property pirates and other such metaphorical pirates _meta_end_dot_

 why tom would choose to act as a dupe of big content and continue to leave the nation defenseless against the robot threat i couldn t quite say _meta_end_dot_

 maybe someone needs to tell the world that his girlfriend s a cylon _meta_end_exclamation_
