  democracy did a thing where they asked a bunch of people to write a short piece about a big idea of theirs _meta_end_dot_

 there s some good ones in there but i thought the most intriguing one was larry sabato s out of left field idea of expanding the house of representatives to include maybe _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ members _meta_end_dot_

 sabato points out that smaller districts would be cheaper to run in making it easier for grassroots challengers to have a shot at unseating incumbents _meta_end_dot_

 this seems plausible enough to me though of course constitution reform is in practice impossible to do _meta_end_dot_
