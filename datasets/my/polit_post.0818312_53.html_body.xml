  claudeb asks if dubya decides to go in iran before jan _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ is there anyone in washington who can stop him since even the joint chiefs have trouble restraining him i get asked this question now and again and as best i can tell it s not a very difficult question if bush orders air strikes against iranian targets nobody can stop him _meta_end_dot_

 a plain reading of the text of the us constitution would seem to suggest that it would be unconstitutional for the military to follow any such order absent a declaration of war or some other form of congressional authorization _meta_end_dot_

 but the settled precedent ratified by key democratic party leaders as recently as the bombing of serbia during the kosovo crisis is that no such authorization is necessary _meta_end_dot_

 i m not happy with this situation and think it s crazy that we as a country have moved away from the constitutional procedure but the cat s been out of the bag for a while now and if bush wants to bomb iran bush will bomb iran _meta_end_dot_
