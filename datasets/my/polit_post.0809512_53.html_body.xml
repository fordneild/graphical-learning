  democracy corps says the following message sells well we cannot afford more of the reckless extreme national security policies of the bush years that lost us trillions of dollars and thousands of lives in iraq _meta_end_dot_

 but john mccain was bush s biggest supporter on iraq and says he is willing to keep our troops there for _meta_number_ref_ years _meta_end_dot_

 i would strengthen america s security by bringing home our troops from iraq during _meta_number_ref_ doing what we need to win in afghanistan rebuilding our alliances and pursuing a new alternative energy policy including alternative sources to reduce our dependence on oil from dangerous regimes _meta_end_dot_

 reckless extreme i like it _meta_end_dot_

 they also say that a priorities message focused on the idea that we re wasting money and so forth in iraq and need to take care of problems at home does pretty well but that the security message has much more resonance especially among independents _meta_end_dot_

 i like it _meta_end_dot_

 an awful lot of john mccain s national security cred is pure bluff people understand that an honorable military record plus lunatic ideas about foreign policy doesn t equal security for america _meta_end_dot_
