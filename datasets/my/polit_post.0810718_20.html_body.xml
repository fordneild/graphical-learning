  i d say the odds are overwhelmingly against the united states having its first woman president but at the same time the _meta_number_ref_ women serving in the u s _meta_end_dot_

 senate and _meta_number_ref_ women members in the house of representatives represent an all time high in both chambers obviously with women being _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ percent of the population that s as much a sign of how far we fall short as of how far we ve come but it s still worth noting _meta_end_dot_

 the number of women in the house is very likely to rise as a result of democratic pickups and jeanne shaheen is extremely likely to become a u s _meta_end_dot_

 senator though she may be offset by the louisiana race _meta_end_dot_

 turnover in the congress is due to the large incumbent advantage a slow process but i think we are inching toward equity _meta_end_dot_

 meanwhile it still seems to me that nancy pelosi s ascension to become the first woman speaker has been under remarked upon _meta_end_dot_

 i suppose the public at large doesn t quite realize how powerful that office is _meta_end_dot_
