  there s something pretty cool about the shape of the miami related sprawl when you pull it out to an appropriate distance _meta_end_dot_

 i d been interested to know what if anything is legally or practically preventing the city from just expanding further and further west if anyone happens to know _meta_end_dot_

 update yes yes commenters i know it s a freaking swamp but there s plenty of development on ex swampland in florida hence all the canals and weird looking lakes _meta_end_dot_
