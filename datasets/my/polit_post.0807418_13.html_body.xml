  interesting stuff petraeus who is preparing to testify to congress next month on the iraq war said in an interview that no one in the u s _meta_end_dot_

 and iraqi governments feels that there has been sufficient progress by any means in the area of national reconciliation or in the provision of basic public services _meta_end_dot_

 i dunno about that certainly it seems to me that a lot of the current u s _meta_end_dot_

 government s allies have been arguing falsely that there has been adequate progress toward reconciliation _meta_end_dot_

 either way i think the point is clear enough petraeus is right that if you re willing to expend an infinite quantity of american lives american money and american resources of diplomacy and attention on iraq things might kinda sorta turn out okay at some point depending on what happens _meta_end_dot_

 i would only caution that if we cut and run it s also possible that some sunny scenario will emerge _meta_end_dot_

 but in terms of the goals actually set for the surge i e _meta_end_dot_

 reconciliation it hasn t happened _meta_end_dot_
