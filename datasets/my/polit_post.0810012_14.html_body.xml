  i don t think i have the heart to try to watch and liveblog today s house version of the petraeus crocker testimony _meta_end_dot_

 watching the senate version yesterday all day on television nearly drove me insane _meta_end_dot_

 of course if anything particularly noteworthy happens i ll say something but life s too short to watch this all over again _meta_end_dot_
