  mostly what atrios said _meta_end_dot_

 but beyond that a political movement that s interested in providing new public services requires revenue to pay for those services _meta_end_dot_

 to get the revenue there have to be increases in the overall level of taxation _meta_end_dot_

 those increase should take a progressive form the rich should pay more _meta_end_dot_

 but it s absolutely crippling to any effort to outline policy with any level of ambition to concede the idea that any tax that places any burden whatsoever on the non rich is therefore unacceptable _meta_end_dot_

 it s fairly easy to design revenue measures that fall mostly on the rich but extraordinarily difficult to design measures that exclusively snag people who fit a conventional definition of rich _meta_end_dot_

 it s true that a married couple composed of an nypd detective who pulls lots of overtime and a nyc public high school teacher with a lot of seniority can have a joint income of over _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ a year but a tax hike on the _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_k crowd is still all things considered an extremely progressive measure _meta_end_dot_
