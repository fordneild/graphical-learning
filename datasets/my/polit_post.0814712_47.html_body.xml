  i was reading gq yesterday and they were advertorializing on behalf of a _meta_dollor_ref_ sweater _meta_end_dot_

 does anyone really walk around wearing an _meta_dollor_ref_ sweater _meta_end_question_

 i ve had the opportunity in my life to meet a healthy number of rich people and still i m blown away by the price tags on the clothing i see in magazines whenever i break out of the sad political magazine ghetto _meta_end_dot_
