  mark kleiman points out that the ap s version of the of the vicky iseman story has less innuendo but a clearer explanation of actual misconduct in late _meta_number_ref_ mccain twice wrote letters to the federal communications commission on behalf of florida based paxson communications which had paid iseman as its lobbyist urging quick consideration of a proposal to buy a television station license in pittsburgh _meta_end_dot_

 at the time paxson s chief executive lowell w _meta_end_dot_

 bud paxson also was a major contributor to mccain s _meta_number_ref_ presidential campaign mccain did not urge the fcc commissioners to approve the proposal but he asked for speedy consideration of the deal which was pending from two years earlier _meta_end_dot_

 in an unusual response then fcc chairman william kennard complained that mccain s request comes at a sensitive time in the deliberative process and could have procedural and substantive impacts on the commission s deliberations and thus on the due process rights of the parties mccain wrote the letters after he received more than _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ in contributions from paxson executives and lobbyists _meta_end_dot_

 paxson also lent mccain his company s jet at least four times during _meta_number_ref_ for campaign travel _meta_end_dot_

 basically in exchange for money and freebies mccain sought to intervene in a federal regulatory process in favor of a company that had provided him with tens of thousands of dollars in cash and services _meta_end_dot_

 he could try to plead naivet but in light of the hot water he got into with the keating five affair which had the exactly same structure he clearly knew what he was doing and knew that it was wrong _meta_end_dot_

 now whether or not some guy gets to buy some tv station in pittsburgh or not isn t a big deal as such but it s an example of how dubious mccain s straight talk persona is _meta_end_dot_

 what s more i think we can all agree that the subversion of the basic functioning of the federal government see e g us attorneys scandal fema etc has been a major problem during the bush years and we see here that mccain takes a bush like attitude to the integrity of these processes _meta_end_dot_

 update nb thinking more clearly past my loathing of john mccain the times s effort to substitute innuendo for making a straightforward true or false assertion is seems like a pretty shameful attempt to set up a kaus like presumption of guilt _meta_end_dot_

 if they have reporting they re willing to stand behind of a mccain iseman affair they should publish it _meta_end_dot_

 and if as seems to be the case they don t have the reporting then they shouldn t write the story _meta_end_dot_
