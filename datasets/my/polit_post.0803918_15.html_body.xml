  on iraq and whatever broader set of issues one believes are implicated in the iraq debate i only ever hear one message coming from the obama campaign namely obama and clinton disagree and obama is right and clinton is wrong _meta_end_dot_

 team hillary by contrast is always equivocating between two different ideas obama and clinton disagree and clinton is right and obama is wrong _meta_end_dot_

 obama and clinton actually agree but clinton is more experienced and more capable of implementing a sound agenda _meta_end_dot_

 clinton argument two can be made pretty persuasively _meta_end_dot_

 plenty of anti war folks are on clinton s side and obama s never really spelled out what exactly on the level of doctrine he and clinton disagree about _meta_end_dot_

 but the fact that clinton argument one does in fact get trotted out especially when the intended audience isn t yours truly seems to me to badly undercut argument two _meta_end_dot_

 meanwhile and somewhat relatedly i keep encountering people whose view of the race seems to be shaped by the assumption that it s not possible that good faith disagreements exist about national security issues among democrats _meta_end_dot_

 that in essence all democrats have very lefty ideas about this stuff and all deviations from an ideal plane of leftiness are explained by political cowardice _meta_end_dot_

 i m not really sure what evidence anyone would find convincing on this score but perhaps part of the value of having an inside the beltway corrupt villager on your list of blogs i read is that i can tell you that in my experience this is false _meta_end_dot_

 there are lots of strongly partisan democrats who very much think bush has taken the country in the wrong direction but who vigorously disagree among themselves about what national security policy ought to look like _meta_end_dot_
