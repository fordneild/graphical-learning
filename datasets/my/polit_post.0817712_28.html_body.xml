  several people have asked me to comment on the announced roster of the us senior men s basketball team set to compete in beijing _meta_end_dot_

 the way i think about it is this _meta_end_dot_

 the biggest stars in the nba tend to be guys who can score frequently by getting shots in the paint either through low post play or through dribble penetration _meta_end_dot_

 we also know from bitter experience that our international foes will try to counter our scorers by playing a zone defense designed to pack the paint _meta_end_dot_

 we also know that big time nba stars aren t necessarily top notch defenders _meta_end_dot_

 conclusion you want to focus on guys who can shoot from outside and who can defend _meta_end_dot_

 it s not that those are the only important skills _meta_end_dot_

 but kobe bryant fits comfortably within that framework and he s also got more to his offensive game than that _meta_end_dot_

 so you ve got kobe _meta_end_dot_

 then you need to ask what do we want kobe to do when he drives and finds the lane swarming with foreigners _meta_end_question_

 well we don t want him to kick it out to jason kidd who s a poor shot _meta_end_dot_

 but deron williams _meta_end_question_

 now we re getting somewhere _meta_end_dot_

 i think the ideal lineup from big to small would be something like tim duncan shawn marion tayshaun prince kobe bryant and deron williams _meta_end_dot_

 that s a lineup that could space the floor extremely well and defend superbly _meta_end_dot_

 the problem with the roster they ve assembled is that it doesn t include marion or anyone with an marion like ability to defend the power forward position and shoot from outside _meta_end_dot_

 at the same time the team includes non shooters jason kidd lebron james and dwayne wade on the perimeter _meta_end_dot_

 those guys are both good players obviously but it s kind of suboptimal _meta_end_dot_

 wade and james are such huge stars that it s hard to see doing without them but i d feel a lot better with marion instead of kidd we don t need three point guards anyway _meta_end_dot_

 it also continues to baffle me that mike d antoni isn t the coach of the team he has experience coaching nba players and he has experience coaching fiba rules basketball since we re asking nba players to coach a fiba rules game that sounds like what we re looking for _meta_end_dot_

 coach k has experience doing neither of those things _meta_end_dot_

 more broadly i think the discussion around this topic needs to pay more attention to the fact that the rules are different _meta_end_dot_

 you need to design teams that can beat true zone defense _meta_end_dot_

 the closer in location of the three point line changes how effective some people are _meta_end_dot_

 and if you ve been playing the game one way professionally for years it s difficult to just switch to a different set of rules especially when your opponents are more familiar with those rules _meta_end_dot_
