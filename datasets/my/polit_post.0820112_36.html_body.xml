  to me one of the oddest aspects of endless discussions about affordable housing is how little emphasis there is on the fact that many areas have straightforward rules in place that just make it illegal for housing to be affordable _meta_end_dot_

 for example in arlington county virginia you might own a nice big house _meta_end_dot_

 and maybe you re an empty nester who doesn t need as much space in the home anymore now that the kids are out of the house _meta_end_dot_

 so maybe you want to modify the structure somewhat to create a so called accessory dwelling in the garage or the basement that you can rent out to people looking for a cheap place to live _meta_end_dot_

 well you can t _meta_end_dot_

 it s illegal _meta_end_dot_

 but there s a proposal on the table to make it legal as long as no more than two people live in your accessory dwelling _meta_end_dot_

 that d be a good idea though of course families need affordable housing too so i wouldn t favor that kind of arbitrary restriction _meta_end_dot_

 still babies steps babies steps _meta_end_dot_
