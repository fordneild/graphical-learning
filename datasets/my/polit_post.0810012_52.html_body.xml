  my friend justin logan sounds a call for the united states to abandon the concept of nation building _meta_end_dot_

 i m sympathetic to the impulse here i find it enormously frustrating that a lot of people look at iraq and say to themselves we need to get better at this no we don t _meta_end_dot_

 what we need to do is to not do that again _meta_end_dot_

 but that still raises the issue of what this is _meta_end_dot_

 as my other friend mark goldberg says that said i still think that there is a great need for nation building and post conflict reconstruction in today s world _meta_end_dot_

 enter un peacekeeping which has a demonstrated if under appreciated record of success in post conflict zones _meta_end_dot_

 rather than trying to do a better job of invading and occupying countries it may make more sense to broaden our support for the one organization that has some experience and expertise in this line of work _meta_end_dot_

 it s worth saying that this isn t because of some kind of un pixie dust that makes blue helmet missions work _meta_end_dot_

 institutional knowledge factors are in play but as i argue in heads in the sand a big peace of the puzzle is simply that it s very different to get involved in post conflict reconstruction when you re talking about acting as a third party who steps in to keep the peace after a conflict ends and getting involved in post conflict reconstruction when the conflict that you re post was an invasion _meta_end_dot_

 in other words helping to keep the peace when the parties to a conflict in a failed state are looking for a way out of the abyss is very different from deliberately smashing up a bunch of eggs and then deciding you need an omelet recipe _meta_end_dot_

 on top of that there s the matter of structure and legitimacy _meta_end_dot_

 the u n precisely because of many features that sometimes annoy americans universal membership clumsy decision making structure etc is an exceedingly poor tool for domination which makes it a good tool for reassuring people that you re not there to dominate them _meta_end_dot_

 doing more to support these blue helmet missions would be much cheaper than another year in iraq and would do more good besides _meta_end_dot_
