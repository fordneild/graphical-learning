  it seems that the u s _meta_end_dot_

 army has once again lowered recruiting standards in order to meet the manpower exigencies of the iraq war _meta_end_dot_

 fred kaplan goes through what this is likely to mean in terms of the performance of our troops in iraq _meta_end_dot_

 read him for the gory details but the short version is nothing good _meta_end_dot_

 what s more the context for this is a prolonged counterinsurgency of the sort that as general petraeus field manual makes clear requires soldiers who are smarter than we ve usually relied upen even as in reality they re getting less smart _meta_end_dot_

 kaplan observes petraeus and officers who think like him are right we re probably not going to be fighting on the ground toe to toe and tank to tank with the russian chinese or north korean armies in the foreseeable future _meta_end_dot_

 yet if the trends continue our army might be getting less and less skilled at the small wars we re more likely to fight _meta_end_dot_

 this is all true _meta_end_dot_

 but i also think that this turn of events is not only bad news for our prospects in iraq but bad news for counterinsurgency enthusiasts in general _meta_end_dot_

 after all these recruiting issues aren t something that just happened out of the blue _meta_end_dot_

 the proximate cause of the bad for counterinsurgency recruiting situation is the fact that we re trying to wage a counterinsurgency _meta_end_dot_

 and it s not just the rank and file either _meta_end_dot_

 lieutenant colonel john nagl one of the army s handful of top counterinsurgency thinkers decided he d rather work at a think tank _meta_end_dot_

 the army we had in _meta_number_ref_ didn t have enough of the right kind of people to do counterinsurgency well and the effort to do counterinsurgency has pushed the trends in the wrong direction _meta_end_dot_

 furthermore the five years or so we ve been fighting in iraq is actually small beer by the standards that counterinsurgency theory suggests is necessary _meta_end_dot_

 so how are we supposed to prevent this kind of counterinsurgency induced collapse in capacity to do effective counterinsurgency _meta_end_question_

 the job is after all by its very nature pretty arduous and unpleasant the kind of thing that most people with bright prospects elsewhere are going to wind up avoiding in favor of more pleasant opportunities elsewhere _meta_end_dot_

 this is true of even very public spirited people who are going to be able to think of plenty of other ways to serve their community their country or the world that don t involve the kind of sacrifices entailed by repeated deployments to a war zone _meta_end_dot_

 there will be exceptions of course but an effective military requires more than exceptions it s by definition a mass institution _meta_end_dot_

 the exception of course is that in a situation of genuine national emergency you can convince conscript pretty much whomever you want into military work _meta_end_dot_

 but it s hard to imagine the united states being faced with a serious domestic insurgency _meta_end_dot_

 and it s also very hard to imagine an insurgency abroad rising to that level of threat _meta_end_dot_
