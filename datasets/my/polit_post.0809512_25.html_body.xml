  they asked us last night to offer election predictions which i was hesitant to do because i m always wrong _meta_end_dot_

 that said i can see about a million ways in which barack obama is vulnerable and a million ways advantages john mccain has _meta_end_dot_

 but on another level it s just really difficult for me to imagine the incumbent party holding onto power in the face of an unpopular war and a bad economy _meta_end_dot_

 count the fact that _meta_number_ref_ percent of voters think the country is on the wrong track as further evidence along those lines _meta_end_dot_

 given the prevailing mood it seems obvious that the average voter is going to want to vote for a candidate who can credibly promise that he ll pursue substantially different policies from those of george w _meta_end_dot_

 bush _meta_end_dot_

 but mccain has promised to follow bush on iraq promised to follow bush on taxes promised to follow bush on housing issues and shows no sign whatsoever of even understanding why people are frustrated with bush _meta_end_dot_

 so how s he going to win _meta_end_question_
