  i ve wondered from time to time if anyone take s m i a s third world revolutionary lyrics seriously _meta_end_dot_

 the answer appears to be yes as leighton meester tells vanity fair i like fun music too like m i a _meta_end_dot_

 she has good things to say also i consider myself a huge garbage apologist but taylor momsem strains credulity when she says garbage is my all time favorite band meanwhile it s a bit shocking to learn that there now exist famous people who were two years old when stupid girl was released _meta_end_dot_
