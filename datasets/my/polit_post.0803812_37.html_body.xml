  if you look at the fundraising in the democratic race you ll see that hillary clinton has put together an amazing organization that s shattering all the records except _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 the ones being created by barack obama _meta_end_dot_

 in short both contenders are raising tons of money _meta_end_dot_

 this sort of thing which you see time and again ought to debunk the lump of fundraising fallacy that seems to underwrite much establishmentarian loathing of contested primaries _meta_end_dot_

 it s true that if you look at all this money and simply assume it would be out there even if there were no contest happening that it looks like a lot of cash being burned in a negative sum intra party fight _meta_end_dot_

 in the real world though it s the contests that drive the fundraising _meta_end_dot_
