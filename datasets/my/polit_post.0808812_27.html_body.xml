 bush also accused iran of arming training and financing the militias fighting against the iraqi forces would it have killed the times to point out that iran is also arming training and financing the militias fighting alongside the iraqi forces _meta_end_question_

 after all the government of iran has extremely cordial relations with the government of iraq and our main militia allies in iraq were literally created in iran by the iranian revolutionary guard _meta_end_dot_

 this context certainly seems relevant _meta_end_dot_

 meanwhile is there any real precedent for the sort of repeated misstating the identity of the enemy that we ve seen from the bush administration _meta_end_question_

 recall that it took years for the administration to grudgingly acknowledge the existence of a non aqi sunni arab insurgency even though this insurgency had long been the us military s primary adversary _meta_end_dot_

 but now we re supposed to believe that everyone we and our iranian backed allies fight are iranian _meta_end_dot_

 sure _meta_end_dot_
