  anthony cordesman on the stakes in the current fighting which he remarks is as much a power struggle for control of the south and the shi ite parts of baghdad and the rest of the country as an effort to establish central government authority and legitimate rule the us teams we talked to also made it clear that these appointments by the central government had no real popular base _meta_end_dot_

 if local and provincial elections were held with open lists it was likely that isci and dawa would lose most elections because they are seen as having failed to bring development and government services _meta_end_dot_

 basically we re helping isci and dawa use force in the south to lay the groundwork for them to hold onto power that they would otherwise lose at the ballot box _meta_end_dot_

 for more check out this telling post at the counterinsurgency blog abu muqawama which starts out by saying you know who was cool _meta_end_question_

 the jam _meta_end_dot_

 what a great band _meta_end_dot_

 you know who isn t cool _meta_end_question_

 jam jaish al mahdi _meta_end_dot_

 those guys pretty much suck but then by the end it says why some wonder is the u s _meta_end_dot_

 closer to the iran backed isci and badr brigades than it is with the sadrites _meta_end_question_

 why does this make sense _meta_end_question_

 two baghdad political veterans have ruefully pointed out to abu muqawama that while sadr has more popular support the isci crowd have something more valuable they speak english _meta_end_dot_

 one former state department veteran with whom abu muqawama spoke a few months ago pointed out that former iraq honcho meghan o sullivan was particularly vulnerable to falling under the sway of those politicians who didn t just speak in that confusing gutteral language where they write from right to left in co joined letters _meta_end_dot_

 ergo they speak english so they must be our friends _meta_end_exclamation_

 hoo ray democracy _meta_end_exclamation_

 it s always worth recalling that one major problem with u s _meta_end_dot_

 efforts to micromanage political outcomes in foreign countries is that it tends to be way easier for iraqi or pakistani etc political actors to manipulate our leaders than it is for our leaders to manipulate political actors in foreign countries _meta_end_dot_

 americans have more levers more money more guns more power but foreigners have a much better understanding of what s happening _meta_end_dot_
