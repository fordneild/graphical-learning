  polling english people on the question of which british actor does the worst american accent on television seems a bit bizarre _meta_end_dot_

 shouldn t americans decide who s doing an american accent well _meta_end_question_

 meanwhile any list along these lines that features ian mcshane s depiction of al swearengen as a bad american accent has some serious problems _meta_end_dot_

 the character s just supposed to have been born abroad it s not an american accent at all _meta_end_exclamation_

 oh well _meta_end_dot_
