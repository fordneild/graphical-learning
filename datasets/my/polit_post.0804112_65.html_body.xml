  tyler cowen comments on castles battles and bombs how economics explains military history which i ve also been reading the table of contents looks amazing but my browsing indicated this book to be boring _meta_end_dot_

 still some of you should read it _meta_end_dot_

 it is full of factual substance slotted into an economic framework _meta_end_dot_

 the book is indeed a disappointment mostly brought low by poor prose style _meta_end_dot_

 the analysis of the issues at hand is however often quite interesting _meta_end_dot_

 the chapter on mercenaries in italy is an excellent take on the subject and i ll have more to say later inspired by the book s account of the strategic bombing campaign in germany _meta_end_dot_
