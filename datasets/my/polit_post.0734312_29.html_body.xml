  how is it that a national intelligence estimate on iran wound up getting released when it was a made the administration look ridiculous b pissed off the administration s key pyschotic warmonger allies and c the administration has stated earlier that nies weren t going to be released in the future _meta_end_question_

 well pat lang has some rumor mongering that aligns perfectly with my armchair speculation the jungle telegraph in washington is booming with news of the iran nie _meta_end_dot_

 i am told that the reason the conclusions of the nie were released is that it was communicated to the white house that intelligence career seniors were lined up to go to jail if necessary if the document s gist were not given to the public _meta_end_dot_

 translation _meta_end_question_

 someone in that group would have gone to the media on the record to disclose its contents _meta_end_dot_

 did that really happen _meta_end_question_

 who knows _meta_end_dot_

 but it certainly seems to me that this is the correct and honorable way to behave for people who find themselves in possession of important information that s being kept classified for illegitimate reasons _meta_end_dot_

 the motives of the leaker can always be called into question but a person willing to take a stand or as we may be seeing here even a person willing to say he or she is willing to take a stand publicly and bear the consequences carries a lot more weight _meta_end_dot_
