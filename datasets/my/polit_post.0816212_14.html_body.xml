  looks like the permanent occupation plan may not go through as intended faced with stiff iraqi opposition it is very possible the u s _meta_end_dot_

 may have to extend an existing u n _meta_end_dot_

 mandate said a senior administration official close to the talks _meta_end_dot_

 that would mean major decisions about how u s _meta_end_dot_

 forces operate in iraq could be left to the next president including how much authority the u s _meta_end_dot_

 must give iraqis over military operations and how quickly the handover takes place _meta_end_dot_

 leaving decisions about how u s _meta_end_dot_

 forces operate in iraq up to the next president sounds like an awfully good idea to me _meta_end_dot_

 it ll let us among other things debate this issue in our presidential election _meta_end_dot_

 my understanding is that barack obama like most americans and like most iraqis wants american troops to come home pretty soon _meta_end_dot_

 john mccain by contrast like george w _meta_end_dot_

 bush wants them to stay for _meta_number_ref_ or _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ or whatever years irrespective of the cost and irrespective of iraqi opinion _meta_end_dot_

 it seems like a disagreement worth airing _meta_end_dot_
