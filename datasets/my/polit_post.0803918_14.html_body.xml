  so i m contemplating trying to do some podcast interviews as part of the atlantic s ever growing commitment to multimedia _meta_end_dot_

 basically i d talk to someone record the conversation and then you could listen to us talking _meta_end_dot_

 is that something there d be any interest in _meta_end_question_

 are there plausible interview candidates you d be interested in hearing from _meta_end_question_
