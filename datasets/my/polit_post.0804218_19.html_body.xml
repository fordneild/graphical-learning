  here s james bennett now supreme leader at the atlantic interviewing new clinton campaign manager maggie williams for the new york times magazine back in _meta_number_ref_ the biggest mistake of the american press is thinking they know her says maggie williams clinton s former chief of staff and one of her closest friends _meta_end_dot_

 you know people think she s such a big lib _meta_end_dot_

 i think she s extremely conservative _meta_end_dot_

 i think she has more in common with people in upstate new york than in new york city in a lot of ways williams calls clinton patriotic and practical _meta_end_dot_

 she thinks it s important to spend money on social programs but she wants to know that they work maybe so _meta_end_dot_

 but until she stands on her own politically none of us can know _meta_end_dot_

 morris says hillary clinton recognized long before her husband the effectiveness of a campaign based on bite size values issues like school uniforms _meta_end_dot_

 she supports the death penalty as the president does _meta_end_dot_

 she supports abortion rights as he does but she has not made the issue a priority as first lady _meta_end_dot_

 for all her heated warnings about children she has been ginger in using her influence to tilt the balance of power in their favor _meta_end_dot_

 now obviously it s not true that clinton is an extremely conservative politician _meta_end_dot_

 equally obviously she hasn t been an extremely conservative figure throughout her entire adult life _meta_end_dot_

 i m not really sure why williams thought it made sense to describe her boss in those terms _meta_end_dot_

 but in the broader context this a welcome reminder that hillary clinton progressive champion and scourge of bipartisanship is a relatively recent identity _meta_end_dot_

 not only where there the arkansas years and the years of triangulation in the white house but in the years _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ and _meta_number_ref_ clinton s main political priority was trying to convince people that she was a moderate centrist and not the liberal in the closet of her husband s administration _meta_end_dot_

 her april _meta_number_ref_ speech to the economic club of chicago is all about her love of balanced budgets and working with republicans on small bore reforms _meta_end_dot_

 she talks about health care at great length and the idea of an ambitious program for universal coverage never comes up _meta_end_dot_

 now i don t think one should begrudge clinton the right to shift points of political emphasis over time _meta_end_dot_

 i recall back when i was a new yorker not liking the fact that clinton was going to be foisted on us as a senator because it seemed to me to be a waste of a safe seat to give it to someone whose presidential ambitions were going to cause her to hew to a more moderate line than was locally necessary and of course in retrospect those fears were borne out when in _meta_number_ref_ and _meta_number_ref_ clinton chose to use her status as a party leader to help sell democrats on the invasion of iraq rather than use her senate perch to push back _meta_end_dot_

 but tailoring one s politics to suit the constituency is a common turn of events you see it for example with obama and coal over the years _meta_end_dot_

 but it s a reminder that this whole idea of clinton as the authentic true progressive is hogwash she s been challenged from the left in this primary and so she s run to the left at an earlier time her confidantes were telling people that she s very conservative back in october _meta_number_ref_ when her campaign thought it had things all wrapped up she was ready to play the iran hawk as part of a shift to general election mode and who knows what she d come up with in an actual general election _meta_end_dot_
