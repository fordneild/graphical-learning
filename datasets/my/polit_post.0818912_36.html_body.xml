 irak notes that the continued wrangling over sofa sfa issues in iraq is actually a huge opportunity for the united states to get our iraq policy sorted out _meta_end_dot_

 in particular with iraq hinting that they may want the agreement to include a timeline for withdrawal but also indicating that they would like continued military support of some kind from the united states the administration is in a position where it can put a time horizon into the pact and condition the residual support the iraqi government dearly wants on continued political progress to lock in recent security gains a deal of that sort would serve american interests fairly well and also have the odd consequence of largely defusing the iraq issue in the presidential campaign _meta_end_dot_

 but i see no indication that bush or mccain are prepared to settle for anything less than open ended war for open ended occupation with all kinds of sovereign infringing immunities for foreign troops and no real dates whatsoever _meta_end_dot_
