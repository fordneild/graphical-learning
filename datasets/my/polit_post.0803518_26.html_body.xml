  here s an important observation from mark kleiman here s a cheerful finding from the pew poll neither obama s unfavorables among clinton voters now _meta_percent_ref_ nor clinton s unfavorables among obama voters now _meta_percent_ref_ have been rising noticeably _meta_end_dot_

 so it looks as if so far the bitterness of the battle is largely restricted to the political junkies who read and write blogs _meta_end_dot_

 this jibes with my experience of talking to not so political folks _meta_end_dot_

 it also i think explains a lot of the volatility in the race _meta_end_dot_

 you have a large number of people who like both candidates and as a consequence can very easily be swayed from one to the other by relatively minor turns of events _meta_end_dot_
