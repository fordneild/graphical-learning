  i ve previously voiced my view that mitt romney would be the least pernicious republican president but kevin drum s making me take a second look at ron paul still if i had to choose between ron paul and say rudy giuliani for president would i vote for paul _meta_end_question_

 you bet _meta_end_dot_

 there are worse things than being a crank i guess that s right _meta_end_dot_

 on the subjects where paul seems unusually wrong for a republican there s just no chance of paul s policy preferences being enacted into law _meta_end_dot_

 on the issues where paul s views are a lot closer to mine than they are to the average republican by contrast the executive has a great deal of discretion _meta_end_dot_

 paul s foreign policy ideas about the use of force are a good deal more dovish than mine but i think at this point i d rather see the country go too far in paul s direction than too far in giuliani s _meta_end_dot_

 so there you have it _meta_end_dot_

 ron paul less torture and his domestic policy s so crazy congress will be able to block it it seems like a convincing least pernicious republican bid to me _meta_end_dot_
