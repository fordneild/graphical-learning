  jonathan martin has a very interesting article in politico about the huge capabilities gap between left leaning and right leaning new media in terms of doing reporting and the impact that this is having on the campaign trail _meta_end_dot_

 there s no equivalent on the right to what s being done at tpm media or think progress or the washington independent or the huffington post in terms of finding new campaign stories and pushing them _meta_end_dot_

 there s plenty of commentary on the left but on the right that s all there is _meta_end_dot_

 the only real disagreement i would have is that i think martin to some extent overstates the extent to which this is all about old fashioned shoe leather when a lot of it is more research than reporting in that it s the kind of stuff you can do with google possibly while eating cheetos in your underwear rather than by interviewing people _meta_end_dot_

 indeed in a sense i would say that one problem with conventional campaign journalism is that there s too much reporting _meta_end_dot_

 if you re standing outside at a john mccain press availability with a notebook or audio recorded you re very poorly situated to debunk or verify anything mccain is saying _meta_end_dot_

 a well informed person sitting at home with his laptop by contrast can actually bring information to bear _meta_end_dot_
