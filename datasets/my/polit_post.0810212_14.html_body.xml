  if david brock can really put _meta_dollor_ref_ million together to start defining john mccain that would go a long way to raise my confidence about a democratic victory in november _meta_end_dot_

 mccain s doing very well in the polls but in my view it s an open question how much of that is simply a result of the fact that the majority of americans have never heard mccain criticized from the left _meta_end_dot_
