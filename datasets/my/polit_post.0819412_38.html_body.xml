  it seems that john straight talk mccain has ads up claiming that barack obama has voted to raise taxes on individuals earning as little as _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ per year this claim is indisputably false _meta_end_dot_

 beyond that doug holtz eakin s defense of the claim namely that obama voted for a budget resolution that would raise the tax rate for people currently in the _meta_number_ref_ percent bracket and that bracket begins at an income level of _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ is positively risible _meta_end_dot_

 holtz eakin is referring to the level of taxable income not current income at which the bracket begins the correct figure is _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ for _meta_number_ref_ and obama s vote was for _meta_number_ref_ at which point the cutoff would be higher _meta_end_dot_

 but that would be a taxable income level translating to something over _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ for an individual with no dependents or over _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ for a married couple _meta_end_dot_
