  james fallows writes the main drawback is that it allows more time for sniping and bloodletting among the democrats which could leave the eventual nominee worse off _meta_end_dot_

 this is an asymmetrical risk hillary clinton has already been as sniped at as she can possibly be over as we know her _meta_number_ref_ years of public service _meta_end_dot_

 indeed that s part of her argument the oppo researchers won t come up with anything new _meta_end_dot_

 obama has not yet been scarred or vetted in quite the same way _meta_end_dot_

 maybe it would toughen him to go through a round of true negative campaigning _meta_end_dot_

 but maybe it would mainly wound him _meta_end_dot_

 and if he ends up as the nominee he won t be happy about a lot of footage of a former democratic president putting him down which bill clinton provided this week _meta_end_dot_

 clearly on some level this is true but i think these kinds of fears tend to get overstated _meta_end_dot_

 as we ve seen from how rapidly the cw on this primary has whipsawed even if the nomination battle were to go all the way up to convention the remaining months of general election would provide ample time for republicans to make whatever attacks they have to make and generally air the laundry _meta_end_dot_

 meanwhile an extended primary means the eventually winner will have honed his or her message _meta_end_dot_

 since the democrats are all saying the same general kinds of things bush has screwed everything up and i can fix it especially terrorism health care and climate change having competing democratic candidates out there stealing from each other both clinton and obama seems to be moving toward coopting elements of edwards appeal creates a darwinian dynamic whereby the stronger message prevails _meta_end_dot_

 it s true that really ugly negative campaigning could come around to damage the eventual nominee especially if delivered by surrogates like bill clinton but the basic dynamics of this thing don t really lead me to believe that ugly negative campaigning would be a very effective tactic _meta_end_dot_

 both candidates are likable and well liked and there seems to be a lot of backlash potential when anyone gets really cutting _meta_end_dot_
