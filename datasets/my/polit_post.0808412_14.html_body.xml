  part of jim henley s accounting of how he got iraq so right is that he recognized that hayek doesn t stop at the water s edge i could see the self interest of the officials pushing for war how war would benefit their political party their department within the government enhance their own status at the expense of rivals _meta_end_dot_

 libertarianism made it clear how absurd the idealistic case was _meta_end_dot_

 supposedly wise firm and just american guidance would usher iraq into a new era of liberalism and comity _meta_end_dot_

 but none of that was going to work unless real american officials embedded in american political institutions were unusually selfless and astute with a lofty and omniscient devotion to iraqi welfare _meta_end_dot_

 and you know they weren t going to be that _meta_end_dot_

 in my view these considerations remain a huge challenge for counterinsurgency optimists looking forward in iraq _meta_end_dot_
