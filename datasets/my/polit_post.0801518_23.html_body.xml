  commenter pan answers my question about idaho s weird time zones the panhandle of idaho is geographically isolated from the rest of the state by lots of wilderness _meta_end_dot_

 up there they have a lot of activity with the cities on the washington side of the border like spokane _meta_end_dot_

 it s a pain in the ass to change time zones everytime someone in coeur d alene has to run over to spokane to do some shopping _meta_end_dot_

 and indeed as illustrated above there s an interstate link going from coeur d alene into washington while the north south road links aren t nearly as good _meta_end_dot_

 thus the northern bit of the state is more closely integrated with parts of washington than with southern idaho _meta_end_dot_

 you learn something new every day as a blogger _meta_end_dot_
