  the ongoing debate over how many people would wind up without health insurance under barack obama s proposals is interesting but by its nature it s bound to be inconclusive _meta_end_dot_

 what i d like to see a clearer explanation of from the jon cohns and ezra kleins and paul krugmans and so forth of the world is a more detailed account of who s supposed to worse off under obama s plan _meta_end_dot_

 after all i could unveil the following matt yglesias health care plan let s make an individual mandate to buy health insurance at least as good as what congress gets and then run around town slamming barack obama as a foe of the uninsured for leaving millions without coverage _meta_end_dot_

 but that d be dumb _meta_end_dot_

 my hypothetical plan is only a universal health care plan in a vacuous sense _meta_end_dot_

 it wouldn t do anything to actually help people who currently lack insurance _meta_end_dot_

 clinton s plan isn t like that _meta_end_dot_

 it does do things to help people buy insurance _meta_end_dot_

 as a general matter though the things it does are the same subsidies for those of modest means regulations preventing insurance companies from discriminating against those with pre existing conditions etc _meta_end_dot_

 as the things obama s plan does to help people buy insurance _meta_end_dot_

 in terms of specific details neither campaign has released much in the way of specific details _meta_end_dot_

 and what s more everyone acknowledges that any specific details the campaigns might release will likely be changed during the legislative process anyway _meta_end_dot_

 so what s the deal _meta_end_question_

 instead of guessing how many people might or might not buy insurance in obamaland i d like to know what kind of people will wind up uninsured in obamaland and how they d be differently situated in hillaryworld _meta_end_dot_

 in particularly would they actually be better off in hillaryworld _meta_end_question_

 my sense is that mandate advocates are trying to obscure the fact that most of the people who wouldn t have comprehensive insurance after the proposed obama reforms are people who d be screwed over by a mandate _meta_end_dot_

 update i should have added that these are people who arguably should be screwed over _meta_end_dot_

 the goal of national health care policy should be to support the needs of the poor and the sick and the individual mandate is a clumsy way of doing that by making the prosperous and healthy cross subsidize their insurance premiums _meta_end_dot_
