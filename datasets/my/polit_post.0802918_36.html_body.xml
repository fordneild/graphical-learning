  here s a random note from last night _meta_end_dot_

 bush talking about a free trade pact with colombia said if we fail to pass this agreement we will embolden the purveyors of false populism in our hemisphere the purveyors of false populism are i guess hugo chavez and other murky conspirators _meta_end_dot_

 but why is it false populism _meta_end_question_

 chavez is a real populist _meta_end_dot_

 maybe you think he s a populist peddling fake solutions to latin america s problems but he s certainly not a secret pro business neoliberal _meta_end_dot_

 meanwhile what about failing to ratify the colombia trade deal will embolden false populism _meta_end_question_

 this seems like a bizarre context in which to start applying fight them in tikrit so we don t need to fight them in tuscon logic _meta_end_dot_
