  well they haven t called the race yet but based on the returns that have come in so far i don t see how mike huckabee could possibly win _meta_end_dot_

 that said mccain s victory here clearly seems founded on thompson and huckabee splitting a similar constituency _meta_end_dot_

 of course that may continue to happen thompson and mccain are buddies after all in future southern primaries in which case mccain may be in okay shape _meta_end_dot_

 onward to florida _meta_end_dot_

 update it s official mccain wins _meta_end_dot_
