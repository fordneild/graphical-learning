  here s the video of maliki s aid walking back the walkback on a timetable for withdrawal it seems to me that one good reason for the iraqi government to take a welcoming attitude toward something like obama s plan is that this gives them some meaningful bargaining power _meta_end_dot_

 i think common sense dictates that obama would be willing to change a _meta_number_ref_ month timetable into an _meta_number_ref_ month timetable if the iraqi government can put forward some persuasive reasons why _meta_number_ref_ is better than _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 but to get in that conversation you need to be rowing in the same direction as the new president and the american people and the iraqi people and looking to find some definitive light at the end of the tunnel _meta_end_dot_
