  tom brokaw on television is pedantically correcting hillary clinton s claim in her el paso speech that she came here _meta_number_ref_ years ago to work for the democratic national committee registering voters _meta_number_ref_ as brokaw points out was more like _meta_number_ref_ years ago _meta_end_dot_

 but that s silly _meta_end_dot_

 somewhat more substantively what she came to texas to do was work for george mcgovern _meta_end_dot_

 if she wants credit for her experience and years of work she should probably say what she actually did _meta_end_dot_
