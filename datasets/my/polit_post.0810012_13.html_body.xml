  i think kevin drum s being too kind to fred kagan here and really too kind is not a difficult bar to pass when you re talking about kagan in semi endorsing kagan s argument that iraq can t be a distraction from the real war on terrorism in pakistan and afghanistan because nobody wants to mount a huge invasion of pakistan _meta_end_dot_

 that s true as far as it goes but it doesn t really go all that far _meta_end_dot_

 for one thing the afghanistan side of pakistan and afghanistan is a place where there s a role for an increased u s _meta_end_dot_

 troop presence both directly and as a signifier to our nato allies that we re actually taking this seriously and they ought to take it seriously too _meta_end_dot_

 but beyond that the large american deployment in iraq involves more than just the _meta_number_ref_ soldiers who are there consider our foreign language diplomatic and human intelligence resources _meta_end_dot_

 all of those things are in shorter supply than are soldiers per se and all could be useful in pakistan without any talk of an invasion _meta_end_dot_

 and perhaps most of all there s the question of high level attention _meta_end_dot_

 from the president on down there are a lot of busy people in the military diplomatic and intelligence chains of command and at the top level of the interagency process and having them make iraq their own top priority and a top priority on the agenda of every international meeting has real costs _meta_end_dot_

 so yes it s true that i don t have a brilliant off the shelf let s eliminate al qaeda in pakistan in twelve easy steps scheme but it s still the case that everything we try to do there is made more difficult by the scope of our commitments in iraq _meta_end_dot_
