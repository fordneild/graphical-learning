  john mccain is clearly defensive about the allegation that his election would represent a third bush term _meta_end_dot_

 and obviously as i ve noted before mccain would represent a change from bush _meta_end_dot_

 but still on iraq whatever you make of the comparative bush and mccain records mccain is promising to continue bush s policies _meta_end_dot_

 on iran he s promising to continue bush s policies _meta_end_dot_

 on north korea he s promising to repudiate bush s current policy in favor of bush s earlier failed policy _meta_end_dot_

 on judges he s promising to continue bush s policies _meta_end_dot_

 on taxes he s promising to continue bush s policies _meta_end_dot_

 this last one is important because fundamentally it s going to be very different to make substantial changes in the domestic policy sphere as long as you re committed to bush s tax policy _meta_end_dot_

 that does leave us with the important issue of climate change wherein mccain though worse than obama would constitute a major improvement of bush _meta_end_dot_

 that and mixed martial arts where despite mccain s love of boxing and hatred of over regulation he thinks the government ought to step in and put a stop to kimbo slice _meta_end_dot_
