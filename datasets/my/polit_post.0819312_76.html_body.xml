  it seems like she s out of the running but my sentimental favorite for vp is arizona governor janet napolitano who s got a compelling personality and a solid substantive record for a politician who s had success winning statewide three times in a conservative state _meta_end_dot_

 napolitano is well profiled by the american prospect s dana goldstein who emphasized napolitano s role as a party builder in difficult circumstances _meta_end_dot_

 dana thinks this won t be napolitano s last high profile job and i certainly hope she s write _meta_end_dot_

 if the vice presidency is out of the question she seems like she d be an excellent choice for attorney general and also a logical candidate to replace john mccain in the senate whenever he vacates that seat _meta_end_dot_
