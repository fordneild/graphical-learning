  i went to pete s new haven style apizza yesterday for lunch it s on the southeast corner of _meta_number_ref_th and irving and had a pretty decent white clam slice _meta_end_dot_

 i ve had better but for by the slice pizza it s quite good _meta_end_dot_

 i think the yalie at comet ping pong is a better entrant in the dc clam genre but that s not a very convenient location _meta_end_dot_
