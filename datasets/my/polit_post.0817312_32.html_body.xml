  terrible irresponsible column from david leonhardt s the conventional wisdom has it neither senator has been serious about the long term budget deficit both have made rosy assumptions about the revenue that will come from cracking down on waste fraud abuse overseas tax loopholes and other vague fiscal bogeymen _meta_end_dot_

 all this is true enough _meta_end_dot_

 mr _meta_end_dot_

 obama for instance relies on hypothetical savings from electronic medical records to claim that he can reduce the deficit and he hasn t been totally clear about his tax plans _meta_end_dot_

 but the unknowns about the mccain agenda are simply on a different scale _meta_end_dot_

 so far mr _meta_end_dot_

 mccain is having it both ways _meta_end_dot_

 on the campaign trail he has sounded like a bold tax cutter _meta_end_dot_

 to budget wonks though his campaign has gingerly inched away from those plans saying details will be forthcoming _meta_end_dot_

 in the meantime the most cited analysis of his proposed budget doesn t square with what he is saying on the stump _meta_end_dot_

 what he doesn t understand here is that mccain is a well known straight talker whom everyone respects and knows is honest _meta_end_dot_

 therefore this analysis can t be right _meta_end_dot_
