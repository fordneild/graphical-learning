  i just hope the new york times book review is as kind to my book when the time comes as they were to jonah goldberg of course realistically we re all just desperately hoping to be reviewed at all yet the title of his book aside what distinguishes goldberg from the sean hannitys and michael savages is a witty intelligence that deals in ideas as well as insults no mean feat in the nasty world of the culture wars yes that s right liberal fascism is a step away from the nastiness of the culture wars _meta_end_dot_

 the reviewer david oshinsky does concede that goldberg s main thesis is false but that didn t seem to bother him _meta_end_dot_

 i actually would be somewhat interested to hear what sherri berman author of the primacy of politics thinks about the goldberg thesis since her book does posit common roots of fascism and social democracy which she prefers to and distinguishes from progressive liberalism in the revisionist marxist movement of the pre wwi era _meta_end_dot_
