  patrick appel writes that the iseman scandal coverage has been dizzying _meta_end_dot_

 the left jumped at the opportunity to skewer mccain while the right equally cherished the chance to condemn the times this strikes me as a pretty lazy equivalence _meta_end_dot_

 in a nation of _meta_number_ref_ million people i m sure some people on the left have jumped at the opportunity to skewer mccain but just about every liberal i read has taken the time to note that the times sexual innuendos were a pretty inappropriate way to frame a news story _meta_end_dot_

 have i and others skewered mccain s interventions in the regulatory process on behalf of paxson communications and habit of accepting free plane rides from lobbyists _meta_end_question_

 sure _meta_end_dot_

 meanwhile the right it seems to me has basically pointed at the smear and completely ignored these more substantive elements of the case against mccain s self righteousness _meta_end_dot_

 it s a particularly odd trend since conservatives have spent a lot of time over the past ten years complaining precisely about mccain s self righteousness _meta_end_dot_
