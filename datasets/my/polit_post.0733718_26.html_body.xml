  i think it s important to put the revelations that iran halted its nuclear program in _meta_number_ref_ primarily in response to international pressure in the context of the broader trends in us iranian relations that gareth porter among others have reported on _meta_end_dot_

 specifically in _meta_number_ref_ we know that the iranians attempted a diplomatic opening to the united states _meta_end_dot_

 porter reported that in exchange for actually getting something iran was prepared to abandon its nuclear program in a hard to reverse way to meet the u s _meta_end_dot_

 concern about an iranian nuclear weapons program the document offered to accept much tighter controls by the international atomic energy agency iaea in exchange for full access to peaceful nuclear technology it proposed full transparency for security assurance that there are no iranian endeavors to develop or possess wmd and full cooperation with iaea based on iranian adoption of all relevant instruments _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ and all further iaea protocols there have been some efforts to discredit what porter flynt leverret and others have said about this attempted opening but the nie s conclusions about iran s nuclear program seem to strongly support it _meta_end_dot_

 the bush administration then decided to squander this opportunity and focus on saber rattling and dreams of regime change _meta_end_dot_

 but the thing about pressure is that you ve got to be willing to take yes for an answer instead of just blundering around _meta_end_dot_

 meanwhile how outrageous is it that the best twelve months of alarmism from bush cheney have come in the context of an environment where they ve long had access to the intelligence community s assessment _meta_end_question_

 answer very outrageous _meta_end_dot_
