  what dave roberts said _meta_end_dot_

 you do hear with a frightening frequency people with green sympathies up to and including al gore suggest that global warming shouldn t be a political issue drained of senseless rhetoric this seems to reduce to the view that everyone ought to agree with my favored policies and of course i think everyone really should agree with my favored policies _meta_end_dot_

 but in practice they don t _meta_end_dot_

 and so politics _meta_end_dot_

 this is the world and anyone who aspires to radically alter america s energy use patterns needs to learn to live with it _meta_end_dot_

 achieving the goals requires lots of political change _meta_end_dot_

 meanwhile both whatever degree of climate change can t be prevented and whatever prevention measures we adopt will all have different kinds of costs and benefits _meta_end_dot_

 different policies will allocate these costs to different people _meta_end_dot_

 the mechanism by which we decide what to do is called politics and it exists so that individuals and organizations with somewhat divergent interests and ideas can make collective decisions about how to tackle common problems _meta_end_dot_

 the rhetoric of anti politics isn t just an analytic mistake it s part of the problem _meta_end_dot_

 a public that doesn t believe divergent interests can be reconciled and common solutions devised for common problems a public that doesn t believe in politics is going to be a public that doesn t believe there s anything that can or should be done to prevent catastrophic climate change _meta_end_dot_
