  chris dornan raises an issue that is not a topic that many people will want to deal with but i said i was taking requests so what is your position on the goldberg walt disagreement over whether ahmadinejad has called for genocide you can construe ahmadenijad s remarks about israel the way jeff goldberg is doing or you could draw a distinction between the idea of destroying israel as a political entity and the idea of destroying its population _meta_end_dot_

 independent poland ceased to exist in the nineteenth century without there being a genocide of the polish people _meta_end_dot_

 but the whole discussion seems to be undertaken in bad faith _meta_end_dot_

 one way or another iran isn t going to destroy israel _meta_end_dot_

 and one way or another iran s rhetoric about israel is ugly _meta_end_dot_

 at the same time you have people in the united states who want to scuttle efforts at good faith diplomacy with iran in favor of an approach centered exclusively on coercion up to the point of actual bombing and semi pornographic displays of iranian rhetoric about israel is part of their political strategy _meta_end_dot_

 but bombing iran is still a bad idea the bomb iran brigades are still crazy and a serious good faith effort to improve relations with iran is still a good idea _meta_end_dot_

 that s the iran debate that matters _meta_end_dot_
