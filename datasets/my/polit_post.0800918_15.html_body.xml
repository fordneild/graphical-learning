  one point i ve heard time and again repeated by pakistan analysts is that the popularity of islamist movements in pakistan is often wildly overestimated by casual western observers _meta_end_dot_

 in particular people seem to be falling prey to an inability to appreciate scale _meta_end_dot_

 pakistan has _meta_number_ref_ million people so the ability of islamist parties to organize large demonstrations doesn t necessarily indicate that they ve got a widely popular mass movement on the verge of taking control of the country _meta_end_dot_

 when election day comes they re rarely gotten anything more than fringe levels of support _meta_end_dot_

 that said five years ago they did get their best result ever _meta_end_dot_

 but jonathan landay reports for mcclatchy that much of that support has slipped away and they re almost certain to do worse this time around _meta_end_dot_

 fear of an radical takeover in short isn t a good reason to welcome lack of democracy in pakistan _meta_end_dot_
