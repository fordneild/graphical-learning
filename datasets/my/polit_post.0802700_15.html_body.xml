  it looks like bill clinton s heavy handed attacks on barack obama didn t serve his wife well in south carolina with about sixty percent of voters saying clinton s actions were a factor in their decision in what looks to have been a landslide win for barack obama _meta_end_dot_

 that i think is about as it should be _meta_end_dot_

 team clinton has consistently and rightly maintained that they re within their rights to be tough on obama _meta_end_dot_

 and so they are politics is a contact sport _meta_end_dot_

 but that doesn t mean that maximum viciousness is actually a good idea _meta_end_dot_

 you want to be seen as likable fair judicious etc _meta_end_dot_

 and over the past few weeks the clinton campaign has been making its candidate look like something other than the mature experienced sober minded choice _meta_end_dot_
