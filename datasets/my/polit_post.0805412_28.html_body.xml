  tying together yesterday s post on the economy of iceland with thursday s musings on the difficulty of promoting the rule of law i thought i might lay down my general theory that i think the basic ideological debate between the partisans of the free market and the partisans of social democracy actually has relatively little to tell us about macroeconomic growth issues _meta_end_dot_

 the biggest difference you see around the world is by far not one of government policy but of government efficacy _meta_end_dot_

 less important than the differences in what the rules say in other words is the question of how the rules relate to the real world _meta_end_dot_

 in some places you have highly functioning states where the rule of law is effectively enforced _meta_end_dot_

 in other places the formal state has almost no capacity so in practice people are under the thumb of warlords or criminal gangs or what have you _meta_end_dot_

 macroeconomic policy advice that s perfectly reasonable for a large resource rich ethnically diverse country like canada is going to be completely useless in a large resource rich ethnically diverse country like congo and that s true no matter what your perspective on what canada ought to do _meta_end_dot_

 at the end of the day even a very market oriented state is being given an awful lot of powers _meta_end_dot_

 it has police prisons an army navy air force along with a central bank rules about broadcast media where roads and airplanes go some subsistence provision for the poor etc _meta_end_dot_

 that all on its own is perfectly adequate power to ensure that if the state is administered incompetently corruptly or abusively that there ll be all kinds of terrible consequences _meta_end_dot_

 conversely you see in iceland or denmark that when you do have a well governed state all kinds of additional public services can be provided in a very helpful and constructive way _meta_end_dot_

 the main independent variable in the success or lack thereof of different kinds of polities in other words probably isn t the policies so much as the presence or absence or scope of a certain quality of good government that we don t understand much about _meta_end_dot_
