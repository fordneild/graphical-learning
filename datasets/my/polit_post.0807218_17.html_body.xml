  kerry howley has a brief provocative piece inspired by elliot spitzer that basically makes the case for legalized prostitution from first principles of course sexism restricts autonomy in all sorts of ways that deserve consideration when discussing the prevalence of prostitution or the choice to enter sex work _meta_end_dot_

 of course it s deplorable that sexually adventurous young women are constantly told they are degrading themselves by seeking out various experiences that every bit of enjoyment eats away at some secret store of purity _meta_end_dot_

 this whole tradition the idea that women need be preserved in glass so as not to ruin themselves lest they diminish their sexual value by giving it away restricts the lived autonomy of women in ways i can t even begin to articulate _meta_end_dot_

 none of the slut shaming makes sense unless you assume women live to give themselves to men in their purest possible form _meta_end_dot_

 if you find all of these cultural pathologies unfortunate what is the public policy you should prefer _meta_end_question_

 it seems to me that it is not the policy that deems it a crime against the american people to open your legs _meta_end_dot_

 anti prostitution laws add a layer of legal sanction to all of our worst intuitions about the treatment of sexually independent women they strengthen and validate the idea that women who bed men with any frequency are sick marginal pariahs _meta_end_dot_

 even decriminalization which treats johns as outlaws and sex workers as victims assumes that all sex workers are damaged that no woman would ever love sex enough to make a career out of it _meta_end_dot_

 and why not _meta_end_question_

 well because every woman knows that she is her sexual purity rating _meta_end_dot_

 no sane woman would ever choose to mess that up _meta_end_dot_

 i find the pristine logic of these sentiments to be more than a little challenged by every account i ve heard of prostitution in practice under a variety of legal regimes _meta_end_dot_

 still i do think it s a fairly powerful challenge _meta_end_dot_

 it s hard to think of many other widely engaged in activities where the activity itself sex is legal but charging money for it is illegal _meta_end_dot_

 certainly the principle a woman may have sex with whomever she wants for any reason she wants unless that reason is explicit financial compensation doesn t seem to have a ton of logic behind it _meta_end_dot_

 but in many ways this seems to me like a so much the worse for logic kind of situation where i d like to see us move toward liberalization but think we should do so pretty cautiously gestures in the direction of burke tradition etc _meta_end_dot_
