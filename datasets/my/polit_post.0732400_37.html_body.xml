  there s tons of interesting information about the history of american public opinion on this site which has some tables made from the american national election study dataset _meta_end_dot_

 here we see answers to the question are you in favor of desegregation strict segregation or something in between i really couldn t say what that something in between would be but it sure seems to be a popular answer _meta_end_dot_

 between _meta_number_ref_ and _meta_number_ref_ the rise in support for the in between position seems mostly driven by the decline in support for segregation which is all to the good _meta_end_dot_

 then in _meta_number_ref_ support for desegregation reaches its peak as both segregation and desegregation decline _meta_end_dot_

 but then in the next three surveys support for desegregation consistently declines as more and more people shift into this mysterious middle ground position _meta_end_dot_

 it s too bad that they stopped asking this question in _meta_number_ref_ because public opinion was shifting throughout the _meta_number_ref_s and not just in the predictable sense of a steady decline in support for segregation _meta_end_dot_
