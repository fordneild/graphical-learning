  jon chait like me is a mitt romney fan _meta_end_dot_

 the key bits last year the boston globe obtained his campaign strategy document laying out what it called primal code for brand romney primal is a perfect description for romney s view of the gop base _meta_end_dot_

 he approaches conservatism not as a respectable ideology but as a series of in lionel trilling s famous phrase irritable mental gestures _meta_end_dot_

 the strategy memo suggests he drive home the message hillary france romney has promised to double guantanamo and demanded that mike huckabee apologize for criticizing president bush s foreign policy _meta_end_dot_

 this is like a hollywood parody of a right wing republican think bob roberts or tom cruise s character in lions for lambs but more clever _meta_end_dot_

 if romney s public sentiments were more intelligent than this i d fear he actually believed it _meta_end_dot_

 giuliani s conservatism to offer up one contrast is intelligent enough for me to think he genuinely buys into it but still dumb enough for me to fear for the future of our country if he manages to win the election _meta_end_dot_

 the mindless tribalism of romney s pandering is paradoxically reassuring _meta_end_dot_

 the form his pandering takes is a measure of the contempt in which he holds the electorate in general and bush era republicans in particular _meta_end_dot_

 i share his sentiments completely _meta_end_dot_

 right _meta_end_dot_

 i don t think one should delude oneself into thinking that romney is a secret liberal or would become one in office but he s a careful calculating guy _meta_end_dot_

 no furtive motions _meta_end_dot_

 rudy giuliani s not as right wing on some issues but he s bonkers on others _meta_end_dot_

 john mccain as i ve said is flighty he flip flops for no good reason takes up policy positions as a way to prosecute grudges and loves war _meta_end_dot_

 huckabee s bonkers _meta_end_dot_

 in this gop field romney would be the least bad president _meta_end_dot_
