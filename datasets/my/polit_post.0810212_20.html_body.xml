  henry farrell notes that doug feith s blurbers seem to be damning him with faint praise _meta_end_dot_

 if indeed you can even call it will certainly anger many readers because it takes a different position that most other accounts on the wisdom of going to war in iraq on what mistakes were made and on what made them praise at all _meta_end_dot_

 contrast that with say heads in the sand which fred kaplan calls a smart vital book and i think your choice in spring foreign policy reading is clear _meta_end_dot_
