  this is absolute genius conservative radio host kevin james is on hardball to call barack obama and appeaser and chris matthews hits upon the nice idea of asking james to explain what it was that chamberlain did wrong at munich _meta_end_dot_

 as becomes apparent james has no idea _meta_end_exclamation_

 he just likes to say appeasement a lot but doesn t know what it means what the context was what was wrong with it or how it might possibly apply today _meta_end_dot_

 basically he s an idiot which is no surprise but it is rare to see these things so amply demonstrated _meta_end_dot_
