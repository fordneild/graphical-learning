  fareed zakaria the democrats are having the hardest time with the new reality _meta_end_dot_

 every candidate is committed to ending the war and bringing our troops back home _meta_end_dot_

 the trouble is the war has largely ended and precisely because our troops are in the middle of it _meta_end_dot_

 ah those sad sad democrats _meta_end_dot_

 so unaware that the war s over _meta_end_dot_

 the dude who killed at least fourteen and wounded seventeen in tikrit must like the democrats have been wearing partisan blinders when he failed to acknowledge the surge s success in bringing the war to an end _meta_end_dot_

 similarly the us military has these newish mine resistant ambush protected vehicles known as mraps _meta_end_dot_

 as you can tell from the name the vehicles are designed to be resistant to roadside bombs _meta_end_dot_

 only trouble is insurgents seems to have figured out how to foil them since we had our first instance of a roadside bomb blowing up an mrap just on saturday _meta_end_dot_

 obviously though this improvement in the tactics and doctrine of anti american fighters in iraq can t be a big deal since the war is largely over _meta_end_dot_

 if the war were still happening this kind of thing might illustrate the illusory nature of tactical improvements in the face of a bleak strategic situation _meta_end_dot_

 but since the war is largely over already there s probably no problem here _meta_end_dot_
