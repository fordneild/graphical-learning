  it s interesting that the result of not one but both major parties nominating presidential candidates known as process oriented reformers has merely resulted in an usually large volume of campaign finance shenanigans from mccain illegally backing out of the system after having used public financing to secure a loan to obama wriggling out of a commitment to use public financing for the general election _meta_end_dot_

 i bet that two years ago reformers would have told you that a mccain obama matchup would be great for their cause _meta_end_dot_

 in practice it s turned out to be terrible _meta_end_dot_

 and i think it s not a coincidence _meta_end_dot_

 mccain and obama both feel they can take the hit on these issues in part because they re both branded as reformers and thus don t need to worry as much about being perceived as corrupt _meta_end_dot_

 years ago of course mccain had a different reputation as a consequence of the keating _meta_number_ref_ business and became a reformer in part in order to change that reputation _meta_end_dot_

 but politicians who have the clean image can feel free to ditch process constraints whenever convenient _meta_end_dot_
