  via somerby and lemieux richard cohen has an war is peace moment and so it will be the job the obligation the solemn task of the next president to restore that trust _meta_end_dot_

 john mccain could do it _meta_end_dot_

 he s an honorable man who has fudged and ducked and swallowed the truth on occasion about the acceptability of the confederate flag for instance but always i think for understandable although not necessarily admirable reasons _meta_end_dot_

 to be simplistic about this you re looking here at a press that s hopelessly in the tank for john mccain _meta_end_dot_

 to try to be a bit more charitable you re looking here at a press that s hopelessly invested in the doomed epistemology of character _meta_end_dot_

 we can t know what lurks in the hearts of pols but we can make inferences based on their behavior _meta_end_dot_

 but all politicians behavior is mixed _meta_end_dot_

 so we and by we here i mean richard cohen read that behavior through our preexisting beliefs about their character _meta_end_dot_

 and since we know that mccain is honorable he fudges and ducks and swallows etc _meta_end_dot_

 for understandable reasons whereas other lesser politicians are just soulless scumbags _meta_end_dot_

 of course mccain s reasons are understandable he wants to win _meta_end_exclamation_

 but they re just the same reasons everyone else has _meta_end_dot_

 they pander he s understandable _meta_end_dot_

 they lie he fudges _meta_end_dot_

 it s all senseless _meta_end_dot_

 which is i suppose just another way of observing that we re looking at a press corps that s hopelessly in the tank for john mccain _meta_end_dot_
