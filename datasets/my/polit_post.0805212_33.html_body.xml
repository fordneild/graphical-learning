  hillary clinton s campaign is in a weird situation over _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ million in debt not including the campaign s debt to clinton personally but they had _meta_dollor_ref_ million on hand at the end of january _meta_end_dot_

 is she just a deadbeat _meta_end_question_

 hilzoy looks into it and the answer is no the problem is just that too much of her money is general election cash _meta_end_dot_

 basically having maxed out her big dollar donors terry mcauliffe s gone back to that crowd and got them to pony up even more money to make her fundraising figures look more impressive than they really are even though that money can t be spent yet _meta_end_dot_

 meanwhile it is worth zeroing in on the weird case of clinton s _meta_dollor_ref_ million self loan _meta_end_dot_

 right now there are no campaign supporters who feel strongly enough about clinton s fortunes that they want to give her that money _meta_end_dot_

 but if she wins the election special interest groups will now be allowed to in essence but _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ bribes directly into her pocket in order to help her repay the loan _meta_end_dot_

 that s gonna be an ugly situation _meta_end_dot_

 keep in mind that even if she had to just eat the _meta_dollor_ref_ million loss she and bill would still be a wealthy couple so it s not as if giving them money would make sense as an act of charity _meta_end_dot_

 and they re already be in the white house already raising money for the re election so it wouldn t be much of an act of political activism _meta_end_dot_

 it d just be a way to do a financial favor for the woman who happens to be president _meta_end_dot_
