  she finally gets the call _meta_end_dot_

 i was going to say that now it all comes down to texas but actually it s totally unclear exactly what s at stake in texas _meta_end_dot_

 naturally the spin now becomes that if hrc can win ohio in the primary she can carry it in the general _meta_end_dot_

 in the real world no such logic applies and it s a good thing too because a democrat would need to carry obama favoring swing states like minnesota wisconsin iowa and missour and clinton favoring states like ohio in order to win _meta_end_dot_
