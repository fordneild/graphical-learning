  on a recently concluded call with reporters susan rice was pushing back vigorously on the clinton campaign s assertions that she trumps obama in the national security experience department _meta_end_dot_

 her strong points where when she pointed out that clinton s claims of experience often seem overblown _meta_end_dot_

 rice referenced the fact that clinton s surrogates couldn t site any examples of her crisis management experience said that clinton claims to have negotiated opening the border of macedonia but that opening preceeded the opening of that visit by a day and said that clinton s claimed to have played a crucial independent role in the northern ireland negotiations but george mitchell said she was not involved directly i think that s all about right _meta_end_dot_

 rice and the rest of team obama is quite a bit less convincing when they try to talk up their own candidate s experience in these domains _meta_end_dot_

 they wind up winning this argument since they re not the ones who ve been trying to fight the campaign on this issue but the reality is that like most presidents either clinton or obama would be entering office without significant diplomatic or military experience even though these are the most important aspects of the job _meta_end_dot_

 i ll take little experience plus good ideas over years of experience have committed me to crazy warmongering in a heartbeat but that s the basic shape of things _meta_end_dot_

 there were some more interesting ideas put forth on the call on more interesting topics including ideas aimed squarely at john mccain but it ll probably take me until tomorrow to get my thoughts together on them _meta_end_dot_
