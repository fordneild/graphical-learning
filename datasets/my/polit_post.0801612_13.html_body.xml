  was john mccain brainwashed by his north vietnamese captors to destroy this nation no he wasn t _meta_end_dot_

 the entire vietnam veterans against mccain site seems so preposterous that i almost hope it s a deliberate effort to generate a sympathy vote for mccain _meta_end_dot_

 i suspect though that it s meant in earnest _meta_end_dot_

 what s more it s so preposterous that it doesn t even rise to the level of smear _meta_end_dot_

 if you were trying to think of damaging rumors to make up about mccain you d surely come up with something more plausible than this _meta_end_dot_

 instead the sad reality seems to be that some folks are unhinged enough to actually believe this kind of thing _meta_end_dot_
