  commenter eriks says heads in the sand i got the book yesterday and the preface is the best summary of the friedman unit that i ve seen _meta_end_dot_

 i ll read more when classes finish woo _meta_end_exclamation_

 praise is always welcome send me an email but i ll also take on your criticisms and disagreements if you re inclined to try to get a response _meta_end_dot_

 the bad thing about bloggers writing books is that we torment you with nagging about the need to buy our book _meta_end_dot_

 but the good thing is that if you do buy the book you re also buying in to a vast interactive new media experience _meta_end_dot_
