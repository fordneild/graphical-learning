  matt stoller brings an important perspective to the issue of the media under covering foreign policy issues in the campaign namely that the liberal wonk community needs to share some of the blame for this since part of the problem derives from democrats reluctance to engage politically with these issues _meta_end_dot_

 that seems right to me _meta_end_dot_

 any democratic campaign worth its salt can provide for you a wonky discussion of its health care plan or its trade policy _meta_end_dot_

 but it can also generate tv spots quips from surrogates somewhat unfair mailers etc _meta_end_dot_

 that don t at all sound like a seminar on trade policy _meta_end_dot_

 historically they ve been much worse at doing this on national security issues _meta_end_dot_

 a presidential campaign knows it needs to check the national security box so they organize one or more major foreign policy addresses and then kind of play duck and cover hoping that republicans won t attack them and when republicans do attack them whining that you shouldn t play politics with national security _meta_end_dot_

 but if we all take for granted that politics will be played with basic questions of economic growth and fairness then why not play it with national security too _meta_end_question_

 and beyond that ought implies can and there s just no way to hermetically seal foreign policy off from politics one needs to learn how to play the game well _meta_end_dot_

 i even wrote an article about this once that became part of the backdrop for heads in the sand _meta_end_dot_

 i do think things are changing on this front to some extent though mostly in a sense of democrats either getting smarter about playing defense or else the ones who are really bad at defense got killed off in _meta_number_ref_ and _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 most democratic political operations still seem to me to primarily look at national security issues as an area where you might lose points and not as an area in which to be on the lookout for potential lines of attack _meta_end_dot_
