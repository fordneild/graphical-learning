  looks like chellie pingree wins the primary in me _meta_number_ref_ and gerald connolly wins the primary in va _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 both democratic nominees shouldn t have much trouble winning in november _meta_end_dot_

 pingree s clearly the right choice over her main rival and i have mixed feelings about the result in virginia _meta_end_dot_

 connolly s rival was generally more progressive but connolly had better ideas on transportation and planning and since connolly will wind up having influence over the region in which i live i m not too heartbroken to see him prevail _meta_end_dot_

 ultimately though it seems to me that these races usually come down to local or candidate specific factors in the end and thus wind up disappointing ideologues and political junkies who like to see broad national controversies play out _meta_end_dot_
