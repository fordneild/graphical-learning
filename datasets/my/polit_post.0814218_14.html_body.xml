  chris paul a video appreciation via chris hayes the risk posed by paul s success however is that it s going to lead analysts to look at other guys who are excellent ballhandlers who make the occasional ohmygod i can t believe that s possible move and who are too short to succeed in the nba and conclude that they can have paul like levels of success _meta_end_dot_

 but it s impossible to tell from watching highlights and very hard to tell from watching games the small but real differences that have made paul s _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ campaign much better than allen iverson s _meta_end_dot_

 paul pulls down _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ percent of available rebounds iverson grabs _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ percent _meta_end_dot_

 iverson s effective field goal percentage is _meta_number_ref_ percent paul s is _meta_number_ref_ percent _meta_end_dot_

 these are very small numbers but they add up to large differences over the course of a season and it s not really clear that even paul will be able to continue performing on this level much less that other undersized guys will be able to find enormous success _meta_end_dot_
