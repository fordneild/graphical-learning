  i d been under the impression that mitt romney had thus far resisted the urge to claim falsely that reducing tax rates is likely to increase federal revenue _meta_end_dot_

 brendan nyhan shows me that it s not true _meta_end_dot_

 romney s explained that you lower taxes enough you create more growth and if you create growth you get more jobs and thus you get more jobs more people are paying taxes _meta_end_dot_

 you get more taxes paid the government has more money by charging lower tax rates this is not only bad economics but seems to indicate a failure to grasp some of the basic principles of logical inference _meta_end_dot_
