  my old boss mike tomasky has an excellent review of jonah goldberg s liberal fascism that does a good job of getting to the book s main salient qualities it s tediousness it s habit of announcing widely known facts as if they were shocking discoveries and goldberg s failure to argue from any identifiably coherent perspective why isn t he an anarchist _meta_end_question_

 and when you get to this point what isn t fascist etc _meta_end_dot_
