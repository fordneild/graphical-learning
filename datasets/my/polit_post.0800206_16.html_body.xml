  i m not entirely sure what to make of this observation from msnbc s first read but it sure is interesting yesterday we spent some time with the so called second tier on the dem side _meta_end_dot_

 the most striking thing the crowd sizes _meta_end_dot_

 biden and richardson seem to get similar crowds as the gop front runners along the same lines it seems to me that undecided progressives tend to be undecided because they see merit to more than one candidate often including some affection for at least one out of the biden dodd richardson tier whereas undecided conservatives tend to be lamenting their poor options _meta_end_dot_

 again i don t know exactly what the upshot of this dynamic is but it seems like a noteworthy turn of events _meta_end_dot_

 along the same lines what you see on the democratic side is basically people with similar ideas arguing about who s best situated to put those ideas into practice _meta_end_dot_

 on the republican side you have people arguing over their ideological bona fides _meta_end_dot_

 it s as if democrats are trying to pick a leader who ll get things done while conservatives just want to find a sacrificial lamb who doesn t call the orthodoxy into question _meta_end_dot_
