  some interesting observations from john quiggin about easy credit in the united states the relatively generous treatment of debtors in the us seems to illustrate at the national level a pattern found among us states _meta_end_dot_

 pro debtor institutions are in political terms a substitute for redistributive taxation _meta_end_dot_

 where credit is easy and the consequences of non repayment are not too drastic households can maintain consumption for long periods even when their income is falling _meta_end_dot_

 so the political resistance to pro rich policies is much less sharp _meta_end_dot_

 the massive increase in income inequality in the us since _meta_number_ref_ has coincided with an equally massive boom in consumer credit _meta_end_dot_

 but as he points out the equilibrium looks a bit shaky at the moment _meta_end_dot_

 the dominance of the pro rich people political movement in the united states set the condition for the recent bankruptcy reform which made it much harder for people to get out of their credit card debts _meta_end_dot_

 that combined with declines in the housing market has led to the increase in jingle mail that we re now seeing _meta_end_dot_

 financial institutions will surely want protection from that too _meta_end_dot_
