  jacob weisberg somewhat bizarrely is sitting here in _meta_number_ref_ writing about bush s compassionate conservatism as if it s a part of his persona that we ought to treat very seriously _meta_end_dot_

 krugman wonders why are political writers still unaware that bush s phrase compassionate conservatism wasn t an acceptance of the great society but rather a dog whistle to the religious right beyond that why are political writers still unaware that politicians deliberately lie in order to enhance the popularity of their political prospects _meta_end_question_

 compassionate conservatism obviously wasn t just a dog whistle it was also deliberately designed to foster an impression of a more moderate strain of republicanism _meta_end_dot_

 and indeed to do that you had to toss some meat into the soup the following year in _meta_number_ref_ mr _meta_end_dot_

 bush pressed his case for invading iraq and uttered the infamous _meta_number_ref_ words the british government has learned that saddam hussein recently sought significant quantities of uranium from africa _meta_end_dot_

 but alongside that disingenuous indictment mr _meta_end_dot_

 bush presented congress with a new raft of centrist minded initiatives _meta_dollor_ref_ million to minister to the needs of children of prisoners _meta_dollor_ref_ million to treat drug addicts _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ billion for hydrogen powered cars _meta_dollor_ref_ billion in new money to fight aids in africa and the caribbean _meta_end_dot_

 you need to put _meta_dollor_ref_ million into some kind of context relative to the federal budget _meta_dollor_ref_ million is tiny _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_dollor_ref_ million is the kind of budget request you make when you don t really care about the issue at hand but are hoping to gull innumerate reporters into writing about your _meta_dollor_ref_ million initiative as if it were roughly on par with your proposed war whose costs run three orders of magnitude higher _meta_end_dot_

 similarly with the hydrogen cars _meta_end_dot_

 spending _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ billion on hydrogen powered cars certainly could be an element of a centrist environmental policy _meta_end_dot_

 certainly what doling out a subsidy like that suggests logically speaking is concern about carbon emissions and global warming _meta_end_dot_

 and of course that s exactly the suggestion the subsidy was intended to implant but the bush administration isn t concerned about carbon emissions and global warming at all _meta_end_dot_

 they hand out tons and tons of subsidies to the oil and coal industries they steadfastly oppose all limits to curb carbon emissions and they act like a diplomatic wrecking ball at international conferences _meta_end_dot_

 compassionate conservatism was in practice nothing more than spin and a vague gesture at a higher order justification for corruption _meta_end_dot_

 it s bad enough that the press got spun at the time but to look backward from a bush critical perspective and get spun all over again is bizarre _meta_end_dot_

 look at bush he used to care and now he doesn t _meta_end_exclamation_

 but no he never cared what everyone can now see is what people who looked at his policies in detail and in context could see clearly back in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_
