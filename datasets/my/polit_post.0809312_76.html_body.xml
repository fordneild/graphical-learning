  think progress notes yet another instance of john mccain s fuzzy thinking on iraq _meta_end_dot_

 in an april _meta_number_ref_ cnn interview mccain says i said he was still major player and his influence is going to have to be reduced and gradually eliminated thus establishing the prescience for which he s well known _meta_end_dot_

 but in mid march he told cnn that his sadr s influence has been on the wane for a long time basically mccain has no idea _meta_end_dot_

 because this is what when you re getting briefed by campaign staff you hired away from the know nothings at the project for a new american century _meta_end_dot_

 someday we may look back with nostalgia on the steven hadley era _meta_end_dot_
