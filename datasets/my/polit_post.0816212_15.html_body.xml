  linda hirschman had a somewhat puzzling op ed calling on feminism to focus more and i guess abandon efforts by the movement to be open to more diverse people and concerns _meta_end_dot_

 less intersectionality more single minded focus on middle class white women trying to climb the corporate ladder _meta_end_dot_

 mostly i agree with jill filipovich s take on this but i thought i might also say that the alleged lack of progress to which hirschman s recipe of focus is supposed to be the solution doesn t actually seem to me to have been happening _meta_end_dot_

 if you think of the long trajectory of western society you have women being totally excluded from the main positions of economic and political power for hundreds of years _meta_end_dot_

 you also have a situation where since most people are women you can t achieve equality by simply opening the doors of existing institutions to a new group of people _meta_end_dot_

 institutions actually need to be rethought reconfigured and in some instances remade _meta_end_dot_

 that s you know hard to do _meta_end_dot_

 so i don t think anyone should consider it a shocking sign of things gone wrong that thirty or forty years hasn t proven to be enough time to eradicate every problem _meta_end_dot_

 nor do i think the fact that many problems remain should make people think that progress isn t being made _meta_end_dot_

 on the elite issues dear to hirschman s heart we saw our first woman to anchor the nightly broadcast news starting in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 we saw the first woman to be speaker of the house of representatives sworn in in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 things keep changing which is as it should be _meta_end_dot_

 it s okay for people to be impatient with the pace of change but not so impatient that they develop a false sense of crisis and decide that throwing people of color under the bus is the way to move forward _meta_end_dot_
