  all season long i d been resisting the temptation to proclaim the wizards better without arenas but the evidence from this playoff series against the cavaliers is really tending to change my mind _meta_end_dot_

 the fact that agent zero has a solid backup in antonio daniels is what makes this work but the whole rest of the team really does seem to play with both more defensive intensity and more tactical acumen in key offensive situations without gilbert _meta_end_dot_

 certainly i don t think it s a no brainer at this point that arenas should be paid more money if he chooses to opt out of his current contract _meta_end_dot_
