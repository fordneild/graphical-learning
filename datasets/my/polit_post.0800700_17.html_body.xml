  in the latest in a bizarrely long line of efforts to convince us that hillary clinton never supported the iraq war we ve now got her saying after _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ i would never have taken us to war in iraq _meta_end_dot_

 i would have stayed focused on afghanistan because the real threat was coming from there now it s entirely possible that in a purely counterfactual sense had some freakish sequence of events put her in the white house in september of _meta_number_ref_ that hillary clinton would have stayed focused on afghanistan rather than drawing attention to iraq _meta_end_dot_

 but in the real world she was a united states senator the president of the united states asked for the authority to invade iraq and she voted to give it to him _meta_end_dot_

 clinton has on again off again tried to argue now she s on again that that didn t mean she favored actually invading _meta_end_dot_

 but it would seem to seriously undermine the argument that she s a doer with tons of valuable experience to argue that she didn t know what was going on _meta_end_dot_

 in the real world it s hardly creditable to think that she was that naive _meta_end_dot_
