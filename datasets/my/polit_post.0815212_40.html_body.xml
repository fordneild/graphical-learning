  a couple of days ago noam scheiber noted that it seems strange for john mccain to be so eager to talk about iraq considering that iraq is a horribly unpopular fiasco the issue on which he s most closely associated with the horribly unpopular incumbent republican administration _meta_end_dot_

 noam thought it might reflect a baseline lack of adequate cynicism on mccain s part my hunch is that mccain really wants to debate iraq he really truly thinks it s the most important issue facing the country and thinks he can persuade people on the merits and so his political advisers are doing the best they can with it _meta_end_dot_

 i guess i respect that on some level _meta_end_dot_

 and politically it does reinforce his truth teller i d rather lose an election than lose a war image _meta_end_dot_

 but assuming obama is able to establish a minimum level of national security credibility which i think he will mccain may be making a strategic mistake _meta_end_dot_

 i mean i suppose mccain does think that stuff but honestly what else is he supposed to talk about _meta_end_question_

 i don t think it would serve the candidate well to talk about issues he doesn t care about or doesn t know anything about _meta_end_dot_

 and as best i can tell that s um all the issues _meta_end_dot_

 but even though a clear majority of the american people recognizes that endless war in iraq is a bad idea a large swathe of elites agree with mccain s view that there s no number of american deaths that would be too many to try to spare elites from the embarrassment of admitting that iraq s been a failure _meta_end_dot_

 this doesn t seem all that promising to me as a campaign strategy but it s more promising than tired health care mumbo jumbo that mccain himself doesn t seem interested in _meta_end_dot_
