  doing nothing about kosovo independence freezing its status as they say would be the right thing to do and demonstrate an unusual dose of prudence and good sense on the part of the bush administration _meta_end_dot_

 there s nothing wrong in my view with the idea of kosovo being independent but obviously serbs don t like it and it s become an important point of pride and whatnot for russia _meta_end_dot_

 under the circumstances a unilateral western recognition of kosovo independence would do relatively little to help kosovars in concrete terms and a great deal to worsen us russian relations with potentially bad consequences for our policy in the caucuses and iran _meta_end_dot_
