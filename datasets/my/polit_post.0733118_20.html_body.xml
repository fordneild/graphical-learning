  at a press conference today mitt romney denied having said that he would refuse to consider putting a qualified muslim in his cabinet but greg sargent says two witnesses are backing up mansour ijaz s version of events one of the witnesses irma aguirre a former finance director of the nevada republican party who described herself as a registered republican says that she saw romney s comments as racist she further paraphrased romney as saying they re radical _meta_end_dot_

 there s no talking to them _meta_end_dot_

 there s no negotiating with them the other witness is a self described local registered republican named george harris what s more one needs to keep in mind when evaluating these things that none of these people ijaz included has any obvious motive to lie _meta_end_dot_

 indeed the story seems to fit romney s clumsy pandering approach to presidential politics pretty well _meta_end_dot_
