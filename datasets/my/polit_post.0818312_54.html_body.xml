  they say you should drink a lot of water to help acclimate to high altitudes _meta_end_dot_

 apparently at past ideas festivals that s meant handing out a lot of plastic water bottles _meta_end_dot_

 not very sustainable _meta_end_dot_

 so this year the good people at chevron gave everyone durable water bottles and set up water stations like the one pictured above where we can fill up _meta_end_dot_

 between that and their investment in geothermal energy they re the world s largest producers i can t imagine what complaints anyone could have about their environmental record _meta_end_dot_
