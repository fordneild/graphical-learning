  i ve seen lots of commentary on the revelation that bush administration torture techniques have been modeled on the work of the chicoms but not much specific focus on the fact that the main purpose of these chinese torture techniques was to elicit false confessions _meta_end_dot_

 that s not very surprising as the main use of torture in interrogations has always been to elicit false confessions _meta_end_dot_

 but still to literally rip your techniques off from a study called communist attempts to elicit false confessions from air force prisoners of war requires some level of obliviousness i wasn t aware of _meta_end_dot_

 or else maybe they were looking for false confessions _meta_end_question_
