  as you can see from this convenient map drawn from my short print article on foreclosures in the new issue of the atlantic neither iowa nor new hampshire is a place that s bit especially hard hit by the wave of foreclosures afflicting the country _meta_end_dot_

 thus a potentially huge political story hasn t really gotten much political play with all the candidates focused on the early states and all the political press focused on the candidates _meta_end_dot_

 that s about the change _meta_end_dot_

 clark county nevada comprising las vegas and its suburbs is one of the very hardest hit places in the country and florida and california are full of badly afflicted counties _meta_end_dot_

 since neither candidates has staked out a clear profile on this topic it seems like a good opportunity for both of them to try to exploit _meta_end_dot_
