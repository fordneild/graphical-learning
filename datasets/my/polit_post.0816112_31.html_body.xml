  via farley and nexon an instance of what nexon terms nato issuing checks it probably can t cash in the russo georgian conflict over abkhazia _meta_end_dot_

 quite so _meta_end_dot_

 it would be appallingly stupid for the united states or our other key allies to put anything whatsoever on the line for the sake of georgia s efforts to reassert control over its rebellious province _meta_end_dot_

 the question of maintaining a good relationship with an important country russia versus standing up for the independence of russia s neighbors poses some tough dilemmas _meta_end_dot_

 but when the issue is georgia s effort to rule over a province that by all indications doesn t want to be ruled by tblisi the dilemma really isn t difficult at all _meta_end_dot_

 we should just stay far far far away from this dispute and try to make it clear to our friends in georgia that we don t encourage them to do anything stupid _meta_end_dot_
