  i m pretty much a lifelong non owner of a bicycle and i ve certainly never done city biking in traffic but i just got one yesterday _meta_end_dot_

 so be prepared for many future posts about the low quality of america s bike infrastructure and how we should be more like amsterdam or copenhagen _meta_end_dot_

 for example the city fathers of washington dc should consider that though it s nice that they ve established some bike lanes the key thing would be for the lanes to connect with one another and go into the downtown area so they d be helpful for people trying to get from where they live to where the bulk of the stuff is _meta_end_dot_

 it s like how the roads for cars don t just stop arbitrarily _meta_end_dot_

 think about it _meta_end_dot_

 also to the bike thieves of the world don t steal my bike _meta_end_exclamation_
