  as another note on the immigration issue i should note that some of the fear of this topic in progressive circles seems to me to reflect an undue fear of republicans _meta_end_dot_

 basically the thinking seems to be that if republicans are all talking about how tough talk on immigration is going to be a great issue for them it must be right because after all the gop is great at this stuff _meta_end_dot_

 it s worth keeping in mind however that when the ship was being steered by hardened political strategists the republican party was adhering to a firmly pro immigrant line _meta_end_dot_

 it was always known that bush s immigration policy wasn t popular with his base but he thought it was vital to his strategy in the _meta_number_ref_ election and the pro immigration version of the republican party did quite well in _meta_number_ref_ and _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 the turn in republican rhetoric came because the base revolted against the political strategy that had been outlined by the party s strategists _meta_end_dot_

 then as it became clear that republicans were facing big losses in _meta_number_ref_ a lot of them turned to anti immigration rhetoric to try to preserve control but they lost anyway _meta_end_dot_

 similarly in _meta_number_ref_ those of us in the dc area were inundated with anti immigrant ads from virginia republicans running in local races and the virginia gop did terribly _meta_end_dot_

 basically immigrant bashing doesn t have a great track record as an electoral issue and it doesn t seem to be the case that this is actually a cause the republicans started espousing because of it s political utility _meta_end_dot_

 if anything it s the reverse something the political hacks didn t want to take on but that the base has pushed them into _meta_end_dot_
