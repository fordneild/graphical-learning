  it s worth saying that reducing the corporate income tax as per john mccain is not a terrible idea per se _meta_end_dot_

 as far as these things go the corporate income tax is not a great way of raising revenue in part because it s shot through with loopholes and such _meta_end_dot_

 and then the existence of the loopholes and the desire of various companies to squeeze their revenues into the loopholes has a deleterious impact of some kind on economic growth _meta_end_dot_

 i believe the standard center left technocratic proposal is to eliminate the corporate income tax entirely and replace the lost revenue with a hike in the top individual income tax bracket that should ensure that the benefits of a corporate tax cut are captured by the middle class _meta_end_dot_

 that however is very much not what john mccain is doing _meta_end_dot_

 rather he s proposing a cut in the corporate income tax rate and an extension of tax cuts in the top bracket and he s proposing to pay for that through some mix of borrowing and large cuts to domestic spending on retirement security and who knows what else _meta_end_dot_

 there s no good case for doing that _meta_end_dot_

 the imperfections of the corporate income tax though real aren t nearly so terrible as to make it worth paying any price to eliminate them _meta_end_dot_

 the kind of technically sound revenue neutral corporate tax cut i outlined in the first paragraph is the sort of thing you would have expected the mccain of _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ to propose but the new old dogmatic rightwinger mccain is just offering flim flam and smokescreens _meta_end_dot_
