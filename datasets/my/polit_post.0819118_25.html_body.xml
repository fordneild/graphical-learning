  with regard to the post below it is of course worth saying that engineering our cities so as to support the needs of all the users of our streets rather than the desire of suburban commuters to move very quickly is at times literally a matter of life and death _meta_end_dot_

 take the example of alice swanson the _meta_number_ref_ year old bicycle commuter killed yesterday as she attempted to bike west on r street through the intersection with _meta_number_ref_th street by a garbage truck that seems to have turned right without looking to see if anyone was in the bike lane moving forward _meta_end_dot_

 this particular intersection is not an especially dangerous one in my view which goes to show that terrible things can happen even with decent traffic engineering _meta_end_dot_

 but it also serves as a reminder that at other worse designed elements of our streets huge risks are taken every day with the safety of pedestrians and cyclists _meta_end_dot_
