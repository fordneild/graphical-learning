  harold pollack meets the world of major newspaper op eds dick morris and eileen mcgann wrote a self satirical op ed in the new york post slamming the obama health plan _meta_end_dot_

 these authors went on for several hundred words about how wrong it would be to offer undocumented immigrants the same health benefits now offered to the united states congress when this would require rationing care to elderly americans _meta_end_dot_

 i noted one problem with their argument the obama plan does not cover undocumented immigrants a fact that was debated at some length during the democratic primaries _meta_end_dot_

 i noted that one could uncover this fact by entering the words undocumented immigrants obama health plan into a website called www google com _meta_end_dot_

 of course if being accurate were a requirement for op ed pieces then more than one national newspaper columnist might be out of a job _meta_end_dot_

 so given the current economic downturn i think it s important to keep letting people make stuff up _meta_end_dot_
