  on the whole issue of whether or not hillary clinton s run a bad campaign i think it s necessary to draw some distinctions _meta_end_dot_

 i think the obama campaign made a variety of errors during _meta_number_ref_ while clinton s campaign made very few _meta_end_dot_

 what s more clinton s team did a great job of reading the issue landscape well and developing smart policies that were well suited to the political and objective circumstances _meta_end_dot_

 she did what i thought was a surprisingly good job of largely defusing the war issue in the minds of the voters _meta_end_dot_

 what s more they made an excellent recovery after losing iowa _meta_end_dot_

 consequently they woke up on the morning of february _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ in pretty good position up in delegates up in national polls _meta_end_dot_

 then things fell apart _meta_end_dot_

 the campaign made two weird decisions _meta_end_dot_

 first they essentially decide to throw ten primaries and caucuses in a row and that as part of the throwing strategy they were going to repeatedly insult the residents of the states in question _meta_end_dot_

 second they decided to respond to losses with panicky moves amping up the decibel level on their attacks shifting the message etc _meta_end_dot_

 these both struck me as mistakes independently but they ve truly made for a bizarre combination _meta_end_dot_

 thus to add it all up we need to consider different possible interpretations of hillary clinton s campaign it s a big operation a lot of people work there and as best anyone can tell most of them have done an excellent job _meta_end_dot_

 the policy people have mostly come up with excellent policies and the communications people who worked with them have done an excellent job of rolling those policies out providing surrogates etc _meta_end_dot_

 the new media people have done a good job of handling an objectively difficult situation _meta_end_dot_

 her speechwriters haven t produced any classics that ll go into collected volumes but the candidate s not well suited to soaring oratory and the speechwriters have done good work producing speeches that work well for her _meta_end_dot_

 one could go on like this _meta_end_dot_

 lots and lots of people involved with the campaign and the vast majority seems to have done a very good job _meta_end_dot_

 but a few key strategy architects have made a couple of bad mistakes and the candidate herself has chosen poorly in terms of whose advise to take _meta_end_dot_

 it appears likely that those mistakes will be fatal but that shouldn t cast aspersions on all the other good work that lots of people have done over the past _meta_number_ref_ months or more _meta_end_dot_
