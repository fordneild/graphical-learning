  i d like a bit of what the phoenix suns are smoking if they re seriously contemplating this deal _meta_end_dot_

 i understand that there are some marion related chemistry issues but he s six years younger than shaq and already at this point in their respective careers marion is more productive _meta_end_dot_

 shaq s going to mesh with phoenix s up tempo offense _meta_end_question_

 who s going to replace marion as a wing defender _meta_end_question_

 it doesn t make any sense _meta_end_dot_
