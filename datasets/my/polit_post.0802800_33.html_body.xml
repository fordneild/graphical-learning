 as related by ben rogers in a _meta_end_dot_

 j _meta_end_dot_

 ayer a life ayer small frail slight as a sparrow and then _meta_number_ref_ years old was entertaining a group of models at a new york party when a girl ran in screaming that her friend was being assaulted in a bedroom _meta_end_dot_

 the parties involved turned out to be tyson and naomi campbell _meta_end_dot_
