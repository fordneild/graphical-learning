  dan balz writes of florida for the washington post that it looms as a potential showdown in the gop nomination battle not only because of its size and importance but because it will be the first place this year where all the leading candidates are competing perhaps _meta_end_dot_

 on the other hand pollster com currently has things as rudy _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ percent mccain _meta_number_ref_ percent huckabee _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ percent romney _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ percent thompson _meta_number_ref_ percent and paul _meta_number_ref_ percent _meta_end_dot_

 now florida s a winner take all state so if rudy really does sneak ahead of mccain he ll end up with a nice parcel full of delegates _meta_end_dot_

 that s real and that matters _meta_end_dot_

 still as a test of strength rudy s ability to secure _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ percent of the vote against a badly divided field wouldn t be particular impressive _meta_end_dot_

 similarly if rudy s slide continues and mccain gets a boost and he wins with _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ percent that wouldn t be particularly impressive _meta_end_dot_

 the very depth of the field makes it all but certain that the winner will be pulling in a pretty pathetic plurality which in turn makes it hard to see this as a decisive test _meta_end_dot_

 simply put there are too many candidates in the race _meta_end_dot_
