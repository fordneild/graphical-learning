  live asks since you ve got that post up about bush i m going to repeat my earlier question as to whether you matt have any interest in any other kind of music _meta_end_dot_

 i m not just snarking alt rock is well and good but it seems like someone of your intelligence interests background and inquisitiveness would be attracted to other kinds of music as well eh not so much _meta_end_dot_

 i mean i like mainstream commercial hip hop pretty well though i don t follow it all that closely _meta_end_dot_

 and i like shostakovich _meta_end_dot_

 but the overwhelming majority of what i listen to fits into a broad rock of the past thirties years category _meta_end_dot_

 i m afraid i m just not very interesting _meta_end_dot_
