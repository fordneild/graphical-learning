  ed kilgore reflecting on the lessons of john edwards campaign makes an interesting observation while no one will ever know how edwards would have fared had he won iowa his campaign ultimately appealed to the same kind of voters he won in _meta_number_ref_ with a very different message moderate to conservative white men _meta_end_dot_

 his exceptional weakness among african americans in _meta_number_ref_ as in _meta_number_ref_ provides a cautionary tale about the breadth of appeal of populism but doesn t this seem like an unduly narrow reading of the point _meta_end_question_

 edwards adopted a very different political and policy approach in _meta_number_ref_ from what he did in _meta_number_ref_ but the results were very similar _meta_end_dot_

 the interesting fact here is that neither policy shifts nor messaging shifts trump the basic fact that the core constituency for a southern white dude is moderate to conservative white men _meta_end_dot_

 this is one of these things that everyone kinda sorta knows but that often seems to drop out of the picture when it s being discussed _meta_end_dot_
