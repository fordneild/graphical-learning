  i think it s obvious that if you look at the clinton obama primary race has been an important determinant of voting behavior _meta_end_dot_

 working class blacks and working class whites have voted in such radically different ways that it s clear that both candidates are securing a substantial racial solidarity vote _meta_end_dot_

 since there are more whites than blacks in most democratic primaries racial tensions are on balance an advantage for clinton _meta_end_dot_

 but orlando patterson s suggestion that the clinton campaign s _meta_number_ref_ am ad was part of a crypto racist ploy seems beneath the dignity of an important scholar _meta_end_dot_

 this was run of the mill fearmongering reflecting clinton s ideas about the politics of foreign policy _meta_end_dot_

 frankly i think a lot of the charges of racism against the clinton campaign have been overstated _meta_end_dot_

 where they ve been guilty i think is that in their characterization of primary results they ve tended to act as if black people just don t exist in the united states so obama supporters are all highly educated latte sipping intellectuals or rich caucus goers and states with too many black residents don t count speaking merely even as a white person living in a majority black jurisdiction this is an absurd and offensive way of looking at the world _meta_end_dot_

 but the ad s a pretty banal if disreputable attack on obama s liberal approach to foreign policy and not really anything to do with race _meta_end_dot_

 update anti clinton charges that i think are overstated i should say do not include charges that geraldine ferraro is being an ass and wrecking her reputation _meta_end_dot_
