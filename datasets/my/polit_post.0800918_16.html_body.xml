  the world often seems awash in people with hazily defined consultant jobs of various sorts so i was fascinated to read this emphasis added in tyler cowen s review of sudhir venkatesh s gang leader for a day his subject too has moved on _meta_end_dot_

 j t _meta_end_dot_

 grew tired of running a gang particularly when the crack trade dried up and with it a lot of the business _meta_end_dot_

 he tried managing a dry cleaning business and then started a barber shop which failed _meta_end_dot_

 for a while he tried to market himself as a consultant for higher ups in the drug economy _meta_end_dot_

 right now he seems to be living off his savings _meta_end_dot_

 the two men see each other every now and then but they don t seem to have established their previous rapport _meta_end_dot_

 it s interesting that it didn t work out _meta_end_dot_

 i wonder if that was due to some specific failure on j t s part or if the world of drug distribution just shows an admirable ability to resist the consultantification that s sweeping over the rest of the economy _meta_end_dot_
