  when you look at something like the ap s covering for john mccain as he embarrassingly jokes about his desire to kill iranian civilians it s worth considering how the ap would have reported this if the shoe were on the other foot _meta_end_dot_

 ahmadenijad makes a joke at a political rally about killing americans _meta_end_dot_

 soft focus human interest story _meta_end_question_

 i doubt it _meta_end_dot_

 heck what would john mccain s reaction be if that happened _meta_end_question_
