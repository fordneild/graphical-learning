  julian sanchez and dave weigel report for reason that it was primarily lew rockwell probably working with a few associates also named _meta_end_dot_

 they also report that the racist writings in the ron paul newsletters were part of a larger strategy rockwell explained the thrust of the idea in a _meta_number_ref_ liberty essay entitled the case for paleo libertarianism to rockwell the lp was a party of the stoned a halfway house for libertines that had to be de loused to grow the movement had to embrace older conservative values _meta_end_dot_

 state enforced segregation rockwell wrote was wrong but so is state enforced integration _meta_end_dot_

 state enforced segregation was not wrong because separateness is wrong however _meta_end_dot_

 wishing to associate with members of one s own race nationality religion class sex or even political party is a natural and normal human impulse the most detailed description of the strategy came in an essay rothbard wrote for the january _meta_number_ref_ rothbard rockwell report titled right wing populism a strategy for the paleo movement lamenting that mainstream intellectuals and opinion leaders were too invested in the status quo to be brought around to a libertarian view rothbard pointed to david duke and joseph mccarthy as models for an outreach to the rednecks which would fashion a broad libertarian paleoconservative coalition by targeting the disaffected working and middle classes _meta_end_dot_

 duke a former klansman was discussed in strikingly similar terms in a _meta_number_ref_ ron paul political report these groups could be mobilized to oppose an expansive state rothbard posited by exposing an unholy alliance of corporate liberal big business and media elites who through big government have privileged and caused to rise up a parasitic underclass who among them all are looting and oppressing the bulk of the middle and working classes in america the presidential campaign rothbard and rockwell supported in _meta_number_ref_ was ron paul s run on the libertarian party ticket _meta_end_dot_

 in _meta_number_ref_ they were again ready to back paul until pat buchanan convinced the obstetrician to withdraw and back his conservative challenge to then president bush _meta_end_dot_

 we have a dream rockwell wrote in that same january _meta_number_ref_ edition of rrr and perhaps someday it will come to pass _meta_end_dot_

 hell if dr king can have a dream why can t we our dream is that one day we buchananites can present mr _meta_end_dot_

 and mrs _meta_end_dot_

 america and all the liberal and conservative and centrist elites with a dramatic choice we can say look gang you have a choice it s either pat buchanan or david duke sanchez and weigel go on to note that paul has shifted gears well away from this political strategy but perhaps the best refutation of the old approach is not the absence of race baiting rhetoric from its progenitors but the success of the _meta_number_ref_ ron paul phenomenon _meta_end_dot_

 the man who was once the great paleolibertarian hope has built a broad base of enthusiastic supporters without resorting to venomous rhetoric or coded racism _meta_end_dot_

 he has stuck stubbornly to the issues of sound money humble foreign policy and shrinking the state _meta_end_dot_

 he wraps up his speeches with a three part paean to individualism i don t want to run your life i don t want to run the economy and i don t want to run the world he talks about the disproportionate effect of the drug war on african americans and appeared at a september _meta_number_ref_ republican debate on black issues that was boycotted by the then frontrunners _meta_end_dot_

 all this and more have brought him _meta_dollor_ref_ million plus from more than _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ donors thousands of campaign volunteers and the largest rallies he s ever spoken to including a crowd of almost _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ in philadelphia _meta_end_dot_

 this is all true enough as far as the strategic direction of the libertarian movement goes _meta_end_dot_

 then again as best i can tell paul s anti immigration views have about as much appeal as his libertarian ones _meta_end_dot_

 most of all though i think this dog won t hunt ron paul may not be a racist but he became complicit in a strategy of pandering to racists and taking moral responsibility for that now means more than just uttering the phrase that s right on moral responsibility but i don t think it s right on racism _meta_end_dot_

 to have the sort of indifference to the well being and sentiments of black people that you d have to have to be complicit in a strategy of pandering to racists in the way that paul was just is racism in my view _meta_end_dot_
