  one thing to note about hillary clinton s florida and michigan strategy is the utter selfishness of it _meta_end_dot_

 her best shot at getting her way on this issue is to keep observing in a meta kind of way that if the dnc disses florida and michigan by not seating their delegates that this could hurt democratic fortunes in florida and michigan in november _meta_end_dot_

 there are however any number of solutions to this problem _meta_end_dot_

 one if clinton dropped out and endorsed obama the delegates could be seated no problem _meta_end_dot_

 two _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ delegations could be seated without controversy again removing the concern about mi and fl lacking representation _meta_end_dot_

 three leaders of the democratic party from all factions could reiterate that everybody knew the rules going in and the voters of michigan and florida have nobody to blame but their own state party leaders for creating this situation _meta_end_dot_

 but instead clinton has chosen path four of deliberately setting up a train wreck hoping that by credibly committing to the idea that she s happy to sink the party s fortunes in fl and mi if she doesn t get her way she can thereby get her way _meta_end_dot_

 basically it s the same old kind of threats you saw with her big dollar fundraisers either the democratic party needs to serve the narrow needs of the clinton family or else the clinton family will do their best to hobble the party _meta_end_dot_

 it s not a very appealing kind of message and i have a hard time imagining it ll work in the end _meta_end_dot_
