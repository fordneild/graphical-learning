  yesterday dana goldstein observed that esquire s august _meta_number_ref_ cover featuring john edwards was its worst seller of the year _meta_end_dot_

 angelina jolie on the other hand flew off the newsstands according to dana esquire readers may not be all that interested in politics but at least esquire has attempted to cover the biggest election of our generation in contrast to the major women s magazines _meta_end_dot_

 this whole line of thinking seems confused _meta_end_dot_

 for one thing the august esquire obviously sold poorly because matt yglesias was featured in gq that month _meta_end_dot_

 for another thing there s no doubt in my mind that esquire readers were drawn to the jolie cover primarily out of interest for her work with unchr the one campaign and other such endeavors _meta_end_dot_

 well probably not _meta_end_dot_

 but still her work on global poverty and refugee issues is noteworthy and admirable there are worse people to be on the covers of our magazines _meta_end_dot_
