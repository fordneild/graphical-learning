  will be officially unveiled at a campaign event in oregon _meta_end_dot_

 i m not really sure what the bill richardson constituency is but given that while it s lasted his campaign showed the most leadership on trying to get a clear cut commitment to really ending the war maybe he ll help obama get some further credibility with anti war activists _meta_end_dot_

 for my part though i didn t disagree with the many valid criticisms of richardson s campaign i have always wanted to give him credit for mentioning transit and land use issues as part of his energy global warming pitch _meta_end_dot_

 iowa and new hampshire obviously aren t the best audiences for transit talk but given that the leading contenders represent chicago and new york it s a bit sad that it took the guy from new mexico to bring this up _meta_end_dot_
