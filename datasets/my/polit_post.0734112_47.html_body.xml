  obviously you can t miss mark mazzetti s story on the cia s destruction of tapes that would have provided evidence of torture being carried out by american personnel _meta_end_dot_

 spencer s commentary seems apt of course hayden just inherited this whirlwind _meta_end_dot_

 his predecessors george tenet and porter goss sowed it _meta_end_dot_

 and to a greater degree it s the fault of george w _meta_end_dot_

 bush dick cheney alberto gonzales david addington john yoo and john rizzo who created a blatantly illegal interrogation program for the cia to implement _meta_end_dot_

 those on the tapes torturing abu zubaydah and detainee _meta_number_ref_ were loyally doing what those men wanted _meta_end_dot_

 but tenet must have known that what s on those tapes is evidence of criminal activity _meta_end_dot_

 that s a much more plausible explanation for why he stopped taping interrogations _meta_end_dot_

 and it s also probably why rodriguez with goss tacit or explicit consent destroyed them _meta_end_dot_

 if michael mukasey is the same man of integrity he was before he became attorney general he d call that criminal conspiracy or deliberate obstruction of justice _meta_end_dot_

 what will probably end up consuming the remainder of bush s term is an inquiry into the cover up _meta_end_dot_

 but it s always the crime torture systematic and approved by the highest levels that demands focus _meta_end_dot_

 and it was the cia s decision to distract whomever it could from knowing about the crime _meta_end_dot_

 michael hayden as the current front man is obviously going to wind up bearing a lot of the heat for the coverup but it s jose rodriguez cia operations chief at the time who was the actual actor here unless he s willing to fess up and implicate superiors in the conspiracy _meta_end_dot_

 and then there s the underlying crime the culpability for which goes all the way up the chain _meta_end_dot_

 speaking of which i saw a screening of taxi to the dark side the other evening and had planned on holding off on blogging about it until the film was out in theaters but i ll just observe that its dissection of the ways in which command responsibility implicates top officials in the crimes committed on the front lines of the torture trade is really brilliant _meta_end_dot_

 the film also makes the point that for all the flaws of the political press the guys who cover campaigns file dispatches from congress follow the president around and take notes on what he says etc quite a lot of excellent work has been done on these issues by reporters in the field and investigative correspondents based here in washington _meta_end_dot_
