  today s washington post editorial on iraq dedicated to slamming barack obama and hillary clinton is really baffling _meta_end_dot_

 their big point is that democratic plans to withdraw troops from iraq are somehow unrealistic or based on fantasy which seems to simply miss the contours of the argument _meta_end_dot_

 expeditious departure of american forces from iraq isn t some counterintuitive plan to stabilize iraq rather grounded in recognition that an open ended u s _meta_end_dot_

 military presence isn t stabilizing iraq either it s based on the strategic calculation that the nation s resources and manpower should be deployed elsewhere _meta_end_dot_

 that s a point you could dispute but hiatt co _meta_end_dot_

 don t even acknowledge that this is the debate we re having _meta_end_dot_

 you also get weird assertions like this u s _meta_end_dot_

 commanders and diplomats in iraq don t hesitate to say that if american forces withdrew now sectarian conflict would probably explode in its full fury causing bloodshed on a far greater scale than ever before and posing grave threats to u s _meta_end_dot_

 security one gets weary of pointing this out but over and over again we see withdrawal plans being judged by worst case scenarios whereas staying scenarios are judged by best case scenarios _meta_end_dot_

 the truth of the matter is that no matter what we do with the american military the course of events in iraq will ultimately be determined by decisions made by iraqis _meta_end_dot_

 if we leave they might choose poorly with disastrous results _meta_end_dot_

 but that can happen if we stay too _meta_end_dot_

 or they could choose well _meta_end_dot_

 the purpose of the surge was to use our military power to try to alter the decision making of iraqi leaders but it hasn t worked there s little to no evidence that us having _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ troops in iraq is fundamentally affecting the political situation in a positive way _meta_end_dot_
