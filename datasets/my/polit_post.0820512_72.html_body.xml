  max boot tries to rationalize staying in iraqi no matter what iraq s government says _meta_end_dot_

 first this is part of a pattern for maliki who though he won office and has stayed alive literally and politically with american support has hardly been an unwavering friend of the united states at least in public _meta_end_dot_

 although he was an opponent of the saddam hussein regime he was not a proponent of the u s led invasion _meta_end_dot_

 some might see in this maliki as something of an iraqi patriot or if one wants to put it in less ennobling terms a nationalist _meta_end_dot_

 a guy who doesn t like to be oppressed by saddam hussein but also doesn t like to see foreigners conquer his country _meta_end_dot_

 not that bush is saddam by any means but surely i m not the only american who sympathizes with the view don t like the current government wouldn t support foreign conquest after all maybe maliki just thought that once the americans were in iraq the proponents of the invasion would insist on staying forever no matter what the iraqi people or their government wanted _meta_end_dot_

 sure that d just be a paranoid conspiracy theory but you know how prevalent those are in the arab world _meta_end_dot_

 so based on that boot says we can safely ignore maliki and just pay attention to different iraqi leaders who he liked better _meta_end_dot_

 brigadier general bilal al dayni who commands troops in basra for example was quoted in the post as saying we hope they will stay until _meta_number_ref_ which boot tells us is similar to the expectation of iraq s defense minister abdul qadir who says his forces cannot assume full responsibility for internal security until _meta_number_ref_ and for external security until _meta_number_ref_ boot should perhaps consider that the current downswing in anti american violence is very likely to become an upswing again if the united states insists on not only ignoring iraqi opinion and iraq s duly appointed leadership on this issue but does so in a way that signals we ll never leave unless we re driven out by force _meta_end_dot_
