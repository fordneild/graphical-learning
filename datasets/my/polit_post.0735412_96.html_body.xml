  the above graphic appears in this campaign for america s future report on the unprecedented obstructionism of the senate republican caucus _meta_end_dot_

 as they write a roll call of the bills subject to conservative filibuster shows a vision for a different america _meta_end_dot_

 conservatives filibustered bills to end the occupation of iraq reduce subsidies for oil companies and allow residents of the district of columbia to vote _meta_end_dot_

 conservatives used the filibuster to kill legislation that would increase renewable sources for electricity and that would allow soldiers in iraq rest time equal to their deployments digby s right to note the screwy media coverage of this _meta_end_dot_

 i got asked by a radio producer maybe _meta_number_ref_ hours ago if i thought the congress failure to get things done would hurt democrats in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 i said i thought not that part of being in the majority is that you only bring up for consideration issues where the public favors your position _meta_end_dot_

 the republicans thus have been blocking lots of popular democratic measures which should hurt them in the fall _meta_end_dot_

 she reacted as if this was an unusual perspective which i guess it is but it says something that it s an unusual perspective _meta_end_dot_

 but of course i might be wrong this hurting republicans in _meta_number_ref_ is dependent on voters understanding what s happening and i m not sure they are _meta_end_dot_

 certainly though the gop is playing a risky game _meta_end_dot_

 it s worth considering though that they re trying this strategy because they think it works _meta_end_dot_

 they think in particular that during _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ they very successfully stymied bill clinton s agenda and then used their own obstructionism to paint him as a failure leading to big gains in the midterms _meta_end_dot_

 unless a whole bunch of senate republicans lose their seats next year you can expect _meta_number_ref_ to be even more full of filibusters than the current congress has been _meta_end_dot_

 even a landslide triumph in the presidential election for your change agent of choice probably won t make a big difference unless enough senators go down to induce panic _meta_end_dot_
