  i think you had to regard some effort at walking back nouri al maliki s strong endorsement of barack obama s plans for iraq as inevitable _meta_end_dot_

 thus the only thing really surprising about this development is how little effort was made to make it convincing dr _meta_end_dot_

 ali al dabbagh a spokesman for the iraqi government issued a statement saying mr _meta_end_dot_

 maliki s statement had been as not conveyed accurately regarding the vision of senator barack obama u s _meta_end_dot_

 presidential candidate on the timeframe for u s _meta_end_dot_

 forces withdrawal from iraq but it did not address a specific error _meta_end_dot_

 it did soften his support for mr _meta_end_dot_

 obama s plan and implied a more tentative approach to withdrawing troops _meta_end_dot_

 more of the statement which came from the u s _meta_end_dot_

 military s central command press office you can read the full statement at the link but this summary really tells you what you need to know namely that the walkback a doesn t involve maliki on the record b says the reports are inaccurate but doesn t name inaccuracies and c was issued through centcom _meta_end_dot_

 basically this morning we saw maliki speaking in person and endorsing obama s plan to end the occupation in no uncertain terms _meta_end_dot_

 by the late afternoon an iraqi government spokesman was pretending this never happened in a statement released by the occupying army _meta_end_dot_

 that s hardly even a serious effort at bamboozlement _meta_end_dot_

 now the question becomes what happens when the codel currently in afghanistan makes its way to iraq _meta_end_question_

 meetings with maliki are presumably on the agenda _meta_end_dot_
