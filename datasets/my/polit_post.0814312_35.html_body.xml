  thrilling lakers comeback and chicago beats the odds to win the lottery _meta_end_dot_

 i feel torn about these developments _meta_end_dot_

 my fundamental perspective as a fan is that of the hater who likes to see the mighty brought low _meta_end_dot_

 i bonded with tim duncan manu ginobili and tony parker when they crushed the shaq kobe juggernaut in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 by _meta_number_ref_ san antonio has arguably become the evil empire _meta_end_dot_

 but despite enormous success since _meta_number_ref_ san antonio still doesn t really rank up their as an elect franchise like l a _meta_end_dot_

 and it rankles to see a team become so good thanks to such a one sided trade _meta_end_dot_

 in the short run perspective in other words the spurs are the juggernaut possibly unseated by an upstart laker franchise _meta_end_dot_

 but taking the longer view the lakers are still the juggernaut _meta_end_dot_

 chicago winning the lottery meanwhile just reeks of rigging _meta_end_dot_

 sure why not send the number one draft pick to chicago all we need to do is tweak the raffle _meta_end_exclamation_

 now of course last offseason it seemed like the bulls were going to be good and then inexplicably all of their young players regressed instead of progressing _meta_end_dot_

 consequently the franchise is basically impossible to project _meta_end_dot_
