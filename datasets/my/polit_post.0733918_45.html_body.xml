  the democratic race has gotten a bit tedious to think about since the arguments are all so well trod but rasmussen s national daily tracking poll shows the republican race in all its fascination in essence the candidates all seem to be close enough in national polling and the situation sufficientlly fast changing that nobody s far enough ahead to have a meaningful advantage and nobody s so far down as to be out of it _meta_end_dot_

 it seems to me that if huckabee wins iowa that still would leave ample time for an establishment rally around john mccain if they want to go in that direction _meta_end_dot_
