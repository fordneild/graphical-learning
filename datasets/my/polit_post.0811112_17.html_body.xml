  ray takeyh had a great op ed last week that i m just now seeing in the past week a parade of bush administration officials have offered a new threat and new justification for prolonging america s errant war in iraq containing iran _meta_end_dot_

 the ironic aspect of this is that iran not only enjoys intimate relations with the shiite government in baghdad but that its objectives in iraq largely coincide with those of the united states _meta_end_dot_

 meanwhile it seems that the iranians have decided to cut muqtada loose and fully line up behind the isci government _meta_end_dot_

 that counts as a form of good news i d say but it also shows how ridiculous the administration s talk of anti sadrist operations as somehow crucial to curbing an iranian takeover are _meta_end_dot_
