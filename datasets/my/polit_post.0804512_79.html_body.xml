  your favorite think tanker and mine turns to donald lambro chief political correspondent of the washington times to channel his amped up attacks on barack obama michael o hanlon a democratic defense and national security adviser at the brookings institution also finds obama s approach dangerous and sophomoric _meta_end_dot_

 the freshman senator s eagerness for one on one talks with tin pot dictators would cheapen the value of presidential summits o hanlon told me _meta_end_dot_

 you don t want a president using his time being lied to by foreign leaders _meta_end_dot_

 hillary would be much more pragmatic _meta_end_dot_

 she has suggested midlevel talks with iran for example he said _meta_end_dot_

 obama would look weak and hillary would not look weak anyone who s pissed o hanlon off this much is okay in my book _meta_end_dot_

 however as the correspondent who brought this article to my attention observed this seems like an odd time and place to go after obama so severely if the intention is really to earn clinton s admiration _meta_end_dot_

 it looks in some ways more like pre positioning for pro mccain orientation in the general election _meta_end_dot_
