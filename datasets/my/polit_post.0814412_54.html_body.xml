  the latest reporting from patrick healy and jeff zeleny on talk of hillary clinton as vice presidential nominee helps me clarify my thinking on this topic _meta_end_dot_

 consider two different scenarios _meta_end_dot_

 in one scenario clinton herself would strongly prefer being a candidate for the vice presidency than being a united states senator with a clear shot at _meta_number_ref_ if obama loses to mccain _meta_end_dot_

 in another scenario _meta_end_dot_

 clinton herself isn t necessarily sold on the idea of being _meta_number_ref_ but could be open to persuasion _meta_end_dot_

 my assumption throughout these discussions has been that we re in scenario number two _meta_end_dot_

 under those circumstances i don t think there s a good case for obama trying to persuade her _meta_end_dot_

 as unity proponent ed kilgore recognizes there are all kinds of threshold problems with the idea and i think the upside to picking clinton over a janet napolitano or a kathleen sebelius is hard to see _meta_end_dot_

 but if we re in the scenario number one it s a different matter entirely you don t need clinton on the ticket to unify the party unless clinton wants to make it the case that you need clinton on the ticket to unify the party but if she does want to do that i think she probably has it in her power _meta_end_dot_

 if that s her attitude that d be a kind of crappy attitude to have but it wouldn t shock me and much as paris is worth a mass the white house would be worth tapping clinton as a running mate _meta_end_dot_

 but i remain skeptical that clinton actually does want to be vice president _meta_end_dot_

 my take is that a substantial swathe of her staff wants her to be vice president because they think a unity ticket is now their best realistic shot at getting jobs in the executive branch _meta_end_dot_

 as i ve observed before bill and hillary have great fallback jobs as a multimillionaires and the head of an important foundation and a u s _meta_end_dot_

 senator respectively but that s not at all true of lots of their campaign staffers _meta_end_dot_
