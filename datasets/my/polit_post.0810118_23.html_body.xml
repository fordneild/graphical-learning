  joe klein wonders why american blood and treasure is being expended over which shiite group controls which town in iraq perhaps it is that sadr s mahdi army is the most potent force opposed to long term u s _meta_end_dot_

 bases in iraq and that a permanent presence has been the bush administration s true goal in this war _meta_end_dot_

 i suspect the central question in iraq now is not whether things will get better but whether the drive for a long term neocolonialist presence will make the situation irretrievably worse one shouldn t however underplay the extent to which the bush administration may have no real motive at all _meta_end_dot_

 when you re establishing an indirect rule relationship with a local proxy like maliki and his regime you risk circumstances in which the tail wags the dog _meta_end_dot_

 we like maliki because we have influence over him _meta_end_dot_

 to retain that influence we need to be useful to him _meta_end_dot_

 he wanted to fight sadr but couldn t take him down alone so our troops had to fight too _meta_end_dot_

 his fights are now our fights even if his fights don t really have anything to do with our interests _meta_end_dot_
