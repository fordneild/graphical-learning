  it s worth noting that not only did john mccain oppose jim webb s bill expanding educational benefits for veterans but he has a long track record of fairly stingy behavior on veterans issues _meta_end_dot_

 as hilzoy puts it mccain has supported basic appropriations for vets _meta_end_dot_

 however when there are two competing proposals he generally chooses the cheaper one and often when only one proposal to increase benefits is available he opposes it one sort of wonders why this is _meta_end_dot_

 mccain s clearly not some kind of dogmatic libertarian and he certainly seems to have a great deal of emotional attachment to the military _meta_end_dot_

 i believe the particular military family in which he grew up was a bit idiosyncratic in actually being composed of life long military officers rather than veterans webb by contrast is also from a military family and is clearly very influenced by his military background but after graduating from the academy put his time in then took advantage of veterans benefits to move on to other things as such _meta_end_dot_

 or maybe he just takes very seriously the idea that we can t make the benefits too generous lest it undermine our ability to endlessly prolong the war in iraq _meta_end_dot_
