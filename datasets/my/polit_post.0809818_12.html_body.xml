  at the end of a pretty long post marc ambinder reports penn s mistake notwithstanding he still retains the confidence of the clintons and will still play a major role in the campaign _meta_end_dot_

 what does that tell you about the quality of advice the clintons believe him to impart to me this has always been the penn issue and it s really not an issue that firing or pretending to fire penn can resolve _meta_end_dot_

 at the end of the day hillary clinton is the kind of person who has looked at mark penn s work in us politics over the past _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ years and deemed him to be a valuable source of insight _meta_end_dot_

 someone who thinks that can and does easily pass the better than john mccain bar but it still makes her a poor choice to lead an attempted revival of progressive politics in the united states _meta_end_dot_
