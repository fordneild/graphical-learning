  bush loved farm subsidies when the republicans controlled congress but now that the democrats are running the show he s gotten religion and is sensibly proposing that we change the current rule which says you can t get subsidies if you earn more than _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ million a year in income not in gross revenue to a more parsimonious _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 congress is trying to hold the line at _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ which prompts megan mcardle to wonder of all possible reforms this would seem to be a no brainer _meta_end_dot_

 how many fabulously wealthy democratic farmers in swing states can there be i think there s a twofold answer _meta_end_dot_

 one is that farm state residents and their elected representatives may well believe that subsidies to rich farmers have positive trickle down impacts on the whole community _meta_end_dot_

 indeed one mistake i think liberals sometimes make is to assume that political disputes about economic self interest will naturally break down as higher income versus lower income rather than region versus region or industry versus industry _meta_end_dot_

 the other is that money really does talk in politics as in larry bartels finding that the preferences of voters in the bottom third of the income distribution have no discernible effect on senators roll call votes there may not be many farmers earning between _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ and _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ a year but the fact that their interests carry a lot of weight in the halls of congress isn t actually especially aberrant _meta_end_dot_
