  stanley kurtz observes that it s been noted how little difference a raft of high profile endorsements by the kennedy clan and other heavy hitters in massachusetts made to the outcome there i have heard that from a lot of people _meta_end_dot_

 i think those people may have unrealistic expectations _meta_end_dot_

 look at this chart from pollster com which fairly accurately forecast the bay state as a solid clinton win _meta_end_dot_

 that s still a state in which obama achieved a massive late stage surge helped along by high profile endorsements _meta_end_dot_

 if he d had another two weeks to campaign maybe he would have closed the gap _meta_end_dot_

 or maybe not _meta_end_dot_

 certainly if he d had more time to build on the endorsements in order to construct an actual massachusetts ground game that would have helped _meta_end_dot_

 but the idea that ted kennedy just bounced off the electorate isn t well supported by the evidence _meta_end_dot_
