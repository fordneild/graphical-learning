  i got a rare in person request on saturday from a dude who introduced himself to me at a glasses store to write something about tim pawlenty since he seems to be a leading mccain vp candidate but nobody knows anything about him _meta_end_dot_

 the best place to start is probably noam scheiber s recent tnr profile which lays out the basic facts he s a young smart hard working guy who marries social conservatism to a certain amount of populist rhetoric while mostly hewing to gop fiscal orthodoxy _meta_end_dot_

 like a lot of governors who ve had to grapple with opposition party control of the state legislature he doesn t have much in the way of grand accomplishments and also has a certain aura of moderation about him but it s a little bit hard to know exactly where he stands _meta_end_dot_

 basically he seems like a good vp choice along a bunch of dimensions beyond the fact that this seems like mccain s only hope of putting minnesota in play _meta_end_dot_
