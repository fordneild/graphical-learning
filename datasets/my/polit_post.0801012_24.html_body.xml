  i d really drifted away from watching cable news for several years but on these big primary news days one needs to shift back _meta_end_dot_

 in the meantime i ve gotten used to watching most programming either on dvd or else in high definition _meta_end_dot_

 once you grow accustomed to it it s really striking to turn back to something low def like msnbc or cnn _meta_end_dot_

 one can t help but think that if these news channels broadcast in higher definition it would make a big difference to how some of these candidates look and in turn how the voters perceive them _meta_end_dot_

 john mccain most notably is covering up some very old man looking skin under a big ol layer of makeup in a way that i bet wouldn t work nearly as well _meta_end_dot_
