  looks like former congressman bob barr is going to get in the race as a libertarian _meta_end_dot_

 i think it s safe to say that he won t be elected president _meta_end_dot_

 that said i think there will probably be a bunch of voters who don t much like the mccain perpetual war agenda but who also think that at the end of the day barack obama s a liberal and they re not not _meta_end_dot_

 in theory at least there s room for a sort of john anderson figure and you could see barr playing that role _meta_end_dot_
