  i think this element of paul krugman s grudging willingness to give barack obama credit on the gas tax issue deserves a response just to be clear i don t regard this as a major issue _meta_end_dot_

 it s a one time thing not a matter of principle especially because everyone knows the gas tax holiday isn t actually going to happen _meta_end_dot_

 health care reform on the other hand could happen and is very much a long term issue so poisoning the well by in effect running against universality as obama has is a much more serious breach _meta_end_dot_

 i think that s wildly off base _meta_end_dot_

 it s true that the health care plan obama is attacking is in fact better than the plan he s proposing _meta_end_dot_

 but obama s health care plan would in fact improve the situation _meta_end_dot_

 he s making the good the enemy of the better which isn t admirable but it s not the worst thing in the world _meta_end_dot_

 clinton is by contrast proposing to make things worse which isn t at all what you want to see your presidential candidates proposing _meta_end_dot_

 what s more as brad plumer says this is hardly a short term issue is clinton really going to implement a cap and trade program if she thinks the correct policy response to rising gasoline prices is tax cuts _meta_end_question_

 there s a big problem here _meta_end_dot_
