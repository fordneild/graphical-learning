  ever since i found out about the ridiculous apple ram overcharges i ve become slightly obsessed _meta_end_dot_

 i m not sure for example what you would really want _meta_number_ref_ gigs of ram in your macbook pro for but apple will do the job for _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ that s the price of the ram alone the computer costs more but you could buy the same thing over here for _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 that s a jaw dropping price differential _meta_end_dot_
