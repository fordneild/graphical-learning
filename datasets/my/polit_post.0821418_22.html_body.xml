  barack obama paraphrases ronald reagan s famous question are you better off than you were four or eight years ago now personally i d say i m much better off than i was as an awkward nineteen year old college sophomore _meta_end_dot_

 on the other hand i m not sure that i d give george w _meta_end_dot_

 bush a ton of credit for that _meta_end_dot_

 which is what s a bit odd about this question i m not sure how tightly linked people s overall well being really is to average economic trends _meta_end_dot_

 and at the same time the biggest victims of bush s policies are the ones who are dead and thus don t have the chance to complain about it _meta_end_dot_

 a lot of people who were working eight years ago are retired today _meta_end_dot_

 and a lot of people who are working today were kids eight years ago _meta_end_dot_

 many others have children today who they didn t have eight years ago _meta_end_dot_

 or maybe eight years ago they were happily married and now they re divorced _meta_end_dot_

 but even sticking to the strictly economic we know that any given individual s wages tend to go up over the course of his her career as he she gains experience skills and seniority _meta_end_dot_

 thus even during a period in which average wages stagnate most people will actually be better off than there were a few years in the past _meta_end_dot_
