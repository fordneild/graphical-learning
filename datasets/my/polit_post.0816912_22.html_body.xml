  tinisoli asks what it means if anything that gore is finally endorsing obama not much _meta_end_exclamation_

 you saw throughout the primary season that gore was committed not to getting involved in the primary battle _meta_end_dot_

 and i think that even with the endorsement speech he delivered yesterday gore is continuing to savor his post political somewhat above the fray status _meta_end_dot_

 at this point there s no issue gore is more associated with than climate change _meta_end_dot_

 and climate change plays a key role in john mccain s political strategy he s trying to establish a position that s sufficiently contentless to let him continue to vacuum up vast sums of money from polluting interests while also getting the press to report that he s broke with bush on a major issue _meta_end_dot_

 but while gore did mention the climate change issue he really didn t go after mccain on it _meta_end_dot_
