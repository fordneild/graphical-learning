  ladies and gentlement the candidate of so much experience he has no experience with the modern world they go on for me he said _meta_end_dot_

 i am learning to get online myself and i will have that down fairly soon getting on myself _meta_end_dot_

 i don t expect to be a great communicator i don t expect to set up my own blog but i am becoming computer literate to the point where i can get the information that i need asked which blogs he read he said brooke and mark show me drudge obviously _meta_end_dot_

 everybody watches for better or for worse drudge _meta_end_dot_

 sometimes i look at politico _meta_end_dot_

 sometimes realpolitics at that point mrs _meta_end_dot_

 mccain who had been intensely engaged with her blackberry looked up and chastised her husband _meta_end_dot_

 meghan s blog she said reminding him of their daughter s blog on his campaign web site _meta_end_dot_

 meghan s blog he said sheepishly _meta_end_dot_

 not to get too pedantic here but neither drudge nor politico are blogs and realpolitics doesn t even exist _meta_end_dot_

 the thing i assume he s talking about isn t a blog either _meta_end_dot_

 not that i necessarily expect a presidential candidate to spend a ton of time reading blogs but maybe he should know what one is and if he doesn t read any and is asked about it could say that _meta_end_dot_

 then on religion asked if he considered himself an evangelical christian mr _meta_end_dot_

 mccain responded i consider myself a christian i attend church he said _meta_end_dot_

 my faith has sustained me in very difficult times asked how often he attended he responded not as often as i should he has recently been photographed going to church as his campaign has begun to make public the times he attends services _meta_end_dot_

 does he attend church when he s not campaigning for president _meta_end_question_

 it sort of doesn t sound like it _meta_end_dot_

 did you know mccain hasn t been baptized into the church he nominally belongs to _meta_end_question_

 again i m obviously not opposed to the idea of a non observant president anymore than i m opposed to a president who doesn t read blogs but surely the straight talk brand should require some honest answers to these questions _meta_end_dot_
