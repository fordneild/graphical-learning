  a friend points out to me that both john mccain and barack obama have agreed to accept matching funds and abide by spending limits for the general election if their opponent also agrees to do so _meta_end_dot_

 hillary clinton by contrast has made no such pledge _meta_end_dot_

 if you re a hard core campaign finance reformer i guess this is a reason to support obama _meta_end_dot_

 but if you re a normal person it looks like a strategic mistake on obama s part he d seem to be forfeiting a potentially large financial advantage _meta_end_dot_

 this gets especially problematic when you think about the intervention of outside groups _meta_end_dot_

 it s fairly easy for say a group of insurance companies to just decide to each pony up some cash and run ads attacking a candidate who they think is bad for their interests _meta_end_dot_

 by contrast it s hard to see obama s small and mid sized donor base spontaneously organizing itself into a viable independent expenditure group _meta_end_dot_
