  it seems barack obama may have won more delegates in nevada although if you include super delegates that puts clinton back in the lead again _meta_end_dot_

 update now there seems to be some disagreement as to whether it s _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ in clinton s favor or _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ in obama s favor in terms of delegates allocated _meta_end_dot_
