  i m in total agreement with kevin drum s criticisms of john edwards now more detailed individual mandate plan _meta_end_dot_

 and i should say that i don t think this is a problem with edwards as such _meta_end_dot_

 other advocates of an individual mandate have mostly evaded the flaws of edwards plan by just avoiding discussion of how this is supposed to work in practice _meta_end_dot_

 i think that in a whole variety of ways it s just a fundamentally flawed approach _meta_end_dot_

 see matt stoller for more on this _meta_end_dot_

 the best alternative would of course be a proper system in which we achieve universality by having the government either sign everyone up for a health care plan universal or else sign up everyone for a health care plan who doesn t have one _meta_end_dot_

 unfortunately of course the only person in the race with a plan like that is dennis kucinich _meta_end_dot_

 and if people tell me something like that is politically infeasible in the short run i m happy to believe them _meta_end_dot_

 where my thinking departs from the current democratic consensus is that i don t think it follows from the desirability of a universal system and the impracticality of doing it right in the short run that we ought to therefore put an absolute priority on creating something anything that counts as universal no matter how flawed the design _meta_end_dot_

 to me the incrementalism in a good way aspect of both the edwards and clinton plans is the introduction of strong public sector competition with crappy crappy private health insurance _meta_end_dot_

 over the long run i think that gets us where we want to be _meta_end_dot_

 the mandate itself is neither here nor there _meta_end_dot_

 but if the candidates insist on universality by mandate as the core principle then there s a real risk of the best aspects of these bills getting gutted by congress leaving only a shell of individual mandates and subsidies to insurance firms _meta_end_dot_
