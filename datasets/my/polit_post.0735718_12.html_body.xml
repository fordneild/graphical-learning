  via andrew sullivan eric deplace notes that you save more fuel switching from a _meta_number_ref_ to _meta_number_ref_ mpg car than switching from a _meta_number_ref_ to _meta_number_ref_ mpg car and so you do _meta_end_dot_

 a _meta_number_ref_ mpg car would require _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ gallons of gas to drive _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ miles while an _meta_number_ref_mpg car could get it done in just _meta_number_ref_ gallons _meta_end_dot_

 that saves _meta_number_ref_ gallons of gasoline _meta_end_dot_

 by contrast since a _meta_number_ref_ mpg only uses _meta_number_ref_ gallons to go _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ miles upgrading to _meta_number_ref_ mpg can t save that much gas the super efficient car uses _meta_number_ref_ gallons _meta_end_dot_

 one moral of the story is that the mpg statistic is probably misleading a lot of people who aren t quantitatively sophisticated _meta_end_dot_

 in policy terms meanwhile the upshot is simply that it makes more sense to focus on raising the efficiency of the least efficient vehicles than creating new super cars _meta_end_dot_

 of course the genius of pricing carbon through a tax or through auctioned emissions permits is once again that is spares people the burden of trying to do all the math in our heads and just lets price signals automatically find the most economical way of reaching the targets _meta_end_dot_
