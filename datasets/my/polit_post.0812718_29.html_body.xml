  i wish mike d antoni well but chicago seems like an odd choice of destination considering that the bulls have been constructed around a defense first gameplan and that s hardly what d antoni s known for _meta_end_dot_

 on the other hand the way in which chicago spectacularly failed to meet anyone s expectations this year certainly seems to argue in favor of a change in direction _meta_end_dot_

 it was so strange to watch a pretty good and very young team regress so far _meta_end_dot_
