  this mark halperin op ed is really stunning _meta_end_dot_

 i m glad i ve got a long car ride in my future this afternoon because maybe it ll give me the opportunity to really process why and how this is happening _meta_end_dot_

 at a first glance though while it s certainly possible to join robert farley in slamming halperin s preposterous notion of underdog such that bill clinton in _meta_number_ref_ qualifies and his goofy equivalence between bill clinton s tragic flaw blowjob and george w _meta_end_dot_

 bush s massive death and destruction torture financial crises or to join alex massie in noting the stunning chutzpah and hypocrisy of it all it should be said that halperin s fundamental point is correct _meta_end_dot_

 his op ed says that the media has been dominated by the presumption that campaign coverage should be focused primarily on making judgments about politicians campaigning savvy that the reason the media does this is an assumption that the skills it takes to run a savvy campaign are the skills that it takes to run the country well and that these presumptions are false and should be abandoned _meta_end_dot_

 halperin is a little late to the party _meta_end_dot_

 and by a little i mean a lot go read james fallows old article about why the media sucks _meta_end_dot_

 but whatever if halperin wants to come over to the side of light i think we should take him _meta_end_dot_
