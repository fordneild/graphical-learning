  i thought last night s republican presidential debate served as a useful reminder of how much of john mccain s much vaunted political comeback has been driven by the configuration of alternatives _meta_end_dot_

 the level of support mccain is currently drawing is perfectly compatible with losing badly to a much more popular alternative _meta_end_dot_

 but the field is incredibly fractured _meta_end_dot_

 you have mike huckabee constantly eating away ate mitt romney s efforts to consolidate gop regulars to stop mccain _meta_end_dot_

 and then last night you had a suddenly vigorous fred thompson in the field _meta_end_dot_

 ron paul s eating up _meta_number_ref_ percent or so of the vote _meta_end_dot_

 and rudy giuliani s still in the race and still doing very well in national polling _meta_end_dot_

 with so many candidates in the field you re in true anything can happen territory _meta_end_dot_

 john mccain doesn t seem to have more support than he had in _meta_number_ref_ when he lost _meta_end_dot_

 indeed in some respects he seems to have less support _meta_end_dot_

 but keep enough candidates in the mix and a losing level of support suddenly becomes a winning one _meta_end_dot_

 presumably thompson and giuliani will drop out if they don t stage miraculous recoveries of some sort soon though i suppose one might think that thompson is staying in the race precisely in order to help out mccain _meta_end_dot_
