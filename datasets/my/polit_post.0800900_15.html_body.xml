  the polls and what we can tell of turnout all point toward an obama win _meta_end_dot_

 but thanks to the nature of the expectations game i don t expect winning to do him much further good _meta_end_dot_

 note once again that the main impact of the primary system is not so much to empower the voters of new hampshire as it is to empower the political press _meta_end_dot_

 bill clinton was dubbed the comeback kid based on a number two finish in new hampshire and the press could easily spin a clinton loss by as much as _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ percentage points as a comeback moral victory that sets the stage for a clinton rebound _meta_end_dot_

 don t expect that to happen since the press doesn t like clinton that much and team clinton wasn t complaining about this dynamic in _meta_number_ref_ when it worked in their favor _meta_end_dot_

 that said the press will be bored of obamamania before february _meta_number_ref_ and i bet the reporters tasked to cover clinton wake up tomorrow morning realizing that it s no good for their careers if the democratic primary ends this week so the fight will continue _meta_end_dot_
