  henry farrell quotes an inside higher ed article about owen cargol until recently the head of american university in iraq the university s lofty aspirations as espoused on its web site make the selection of its first chancellor all the more puzzling _meta_end_dot_

 owen cargol who took the helm at au iraq in _meta_number_ref_ and resigned in late april of this year had a checkered past that could have been revealed to university organizers with a simple google search _meta_end_dot_

 the sexual harassment scandal that brought down cargol at northern arizona university in _meta_number_ref_ was well publicized in all of its explicit detail but apparently never came to the attention of the u s _meta_end_dot_

 officials who trusted cargol to help reshape the middle east _meta_end_dot_

 cargol s _meta_number_ref_ resignation stemmed from allegations made by a northern arizona employee who alleged that cargol while naked in a locker room grabbed the employee s genitals the arizona republic reported _meta_end_dot_

 in a subsequent e mail to the employee cargol described himself as a rub your belly grab your balls give you a hug slap your back pull your dick squeeze your hand cheek your face and pat your thigh kind of guy that d be the creepy assaulter kind of guy i guess _meta_end_dot_

 this information literally comes up on the first page of results if you google the guy s name so it s pretty puzzling that you d let him slip through the cracks _meta_end_dot_

 but given the general conduct of the operation in iraq i suppose it s not all that surprising _meta_end_dot_
