  speaking of new york times columnists i like that bob herbert today goes beyond questions of signaling and dog whistles to look at the policies and reagan meant it _meta_end_dot_

 he was opposed to the landmark civil rights act of _meta_number_ref_ which was the same year that goodman schwerner and chaney were slaughtered _meta_end_dot_

 as president he actually tried to weaken the voting rights act of _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 he opposed a national holiday for the rev _meta_end_dot_

 dr _meta_end_dot_

 martin luther king jr _meta_end_dot_

 he tried to get rid of the federal ban on tax exemptions for private schools that practiced racial discrimination _meta_end_dot_

 and in _meta_number_ref_ he vetoed a bill to expand the reach of federal civil rights legislation _meta_end_dot_

 congress overrode the veto _meta_end_dot_

 reagan also vetoed the imposition of sanctions on the apartheid regime in south africa _meta_end_dot_

 congress overrode that veto too _meta_end_dot_

 now whether reagan pursued these policies inimical to the interests of black people because he didn t like black people or because he simply adhered to free market principles whose policy upshot was inimical to the interests of black people i couldn t say _meta_end_dot_

 these days i think a politician whose sincere views about the sanctity of the market led him to the conclusion that landmark civil rights legislation was a serious violation of the demands of political justice would just lie about it much as ronald reagan never proposed eliminating medicare though surely whatever principles drove his push to reduce anti poverty spending and if you look at the poverty numbers you ll see that poverty in the reagan bush years was consistently worse than under nixon ford carter or clinton bush would also have indicated that medicare should be gotten rid of _meta_end_dot_
