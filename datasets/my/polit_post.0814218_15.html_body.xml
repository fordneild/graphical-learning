  ezra says conservatives aren t out of ideas they re out of solutions what they re lacking right now are the appropriate problems _meta_end_dot_

 because they don t have solutions for _meta_number_ref_ million americans without health insurance _meta_end_dot_

 they don t have solutions for a failing invasion that s exposed american power as significantly more constrained that the world imagined it to be _meta_end_dot_

 they don t have solutions for high gas prices or a credit and mortgage crisis or a dawning recognition that we re ruining the only planet we have _meta_end_dot_

 there s something to that but i think the problem is actually much worse the problem with the conservative movement is that it s fundamentally malign _meta_end_dot_

 the plenty of things of for example a deregulatory nature that would enhance access to health care _meta_end_dot_

 reducing the regulatory barriers that artificially restrict the supply of health care wouldn t solve the health care problem in america but it sure would help _meta_end_exclamation_

 and it could be a conservative idea in perfectly good standing _meta_end_dot_

 reducing senseless land use regulation that over mandate parking and under supply residential density would mitigate inequality and reduce carbon emissions _meta_end_dot_

 and that could be a conservative idea in perfectly good standing _meta_end_dot_

 the whole situation of professional licensing in the united states is a scandal and very bad for poor people and easing the burden there could be a conservative idea in perfectly good standing _meta_end_dot_

 the trouble is that no sensible person believes that electing conservative politicians will actually improve the situation because even though some instances of reducing the power of economic privilege would be deregulatory and conservative actually existing conservatism isn t interested in reducing the power of economic privilege except on behalf of some other greater privilege _meta_end_dot_

 similarly the conservative movement is correct to say that more stable family structure would be a boon to america s children but its operational commitment to family values just consists of the political exploitation of anti gay sentiment _meta_end_dot_

 the ideas have some merit it s the actual moral character of the people able to move the levers of power that are the problem they re not fundamentally interested in the merits of ideas even their own ideas they re interested in power and greed _meta_end_dot_
