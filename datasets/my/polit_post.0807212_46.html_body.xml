  michael cohen adds some nuance to my skepticism about the utility of introducing private military contractors mercenaries as we used to call them into a crisis situation like darfur in kenya armorgroup guards protect unhcr refugee camps pae and ayr aviation are working with the un and african union in sudan in liberia dyncorp is training that country s new military _meta_end_dot_

 moreover no one including the contractors themselves are advocating that blackwater or any other private group should go into darfur with guns blazing _meta_end_dot_

 i have yet to come across any serious player in the industry who is advocating a combat role for private contractors _meta_end_dot_

 in fact quite the opposite _meta_end_dot_

 fair enough _meta_end_dot_

 i was responding to a michael walzer piece that i took to be making the case for with guns blazing insofar as that s not what we re talking about there may be a reasonable role for contractors to play _meta_end_dot_
