  like everyone else i sometimes wonder what conservatives are going to think about the bush administration s headline executive power grabs when it s castrating harpy hillary clinton or muslim black nationalist barack obama who s got the power to arbitrarily detain people torture them etc _meta_end_dot_

 in that context you need to give some props to stuff like this house issued a new executive order effectively gutting the intelligence oversight board iob created in _meta_number_ref_ in the wake of widespread abuses by u s _meta_end_dot_

 intelligence agencies bush waited pretty late into his lame duck period to pull this particular stunt so it seems this is mostly a favor to his successor _meta_end_dot_

 he wants john mccain clinton or obama to be in a position to commit widespread abuses and not just hog all the glory for himself _meta_end_dot_
