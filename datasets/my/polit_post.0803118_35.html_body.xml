  one genre of journalism i m always very suspicious of starts with the observation that there appears to be a trend toward such and such tosses off maybe an anecdote or two then leaps to a broad sociological explanation of the trend s existence _meta_end_dot_

 missing is any effort to quantify the extent or reality of the trend itself _meta_end_dot_

 case in point anne applebaum s article about how capitalism causes hot russian women _meta_end_dot_

 she starts by saying that in the _meta_number_ref_s one started to see a lot of hot russian women around whereas whatever you may say about the soviet union in the _meta_number_ref_s and _meta_number_ref_s it was not widely known for feminine pulchritude i looked it up and someone who has pulchritude is roughly speaking an attractive person _meta_end_dot_

 thus the time has come to answer a question posed by a male friend of applebaum s where were they all before her answer though this is a fairly frivolous question ok extremely frivolous i am convinced it has an interesting answer _meta_end_dot_

 to put it bluntly in the soviet union there was no market for female beauty _meta_end_dot_

 no fashion magazines featured beautiful women since there weren t any fashion magazines _meta_end_dot_

 no tv series depended upon beautiful women for high ratings since there weren t any ratings _meta_end_dot_

 there weren t many men rich enough to seek out beautiful women and marry them and foreign men couldn t get the right sort of visa _meta_end_dot_

 there were a few film stars of course but some of the most famous i m thinking of lyubov orlova alleged to be stalin s favorite actress were wholesome and cheerful rather than sultry and stunning _meta_end_dot_

 unusual beauty like unusual genius was considered highly suspicious in the soviet union and its satellite people s republics _meta_end_dot_

 this seems really really dubious to me _meta_end_dot_

 among other things the contention that there weren t many men rich enough to seek out beautiful women and marry them seems oddly gullible about soviet claims to have created an egalitarian paradise _meta_end_dot_

 surely there were high ranking powerful party officials to seek out beautiful women and marry them _meta_end_dot_

 the idea that the soviet entertainment industry was entirely insensitive to the basic principles of attracting an audience seems likewise bizarre _meta_end_dot_

 zhanna prokhorenko playing the love interest in ballad of a soldier certainly seems like an attractive woman to me _meta_end_dot_

 here s a review essay for the criterion collection release of the film besides rejecting political rhetoric and monumental classical cinematography the films of the thaw also rejected the sexless puritanical soviet representation of love on the screen reclaiming the body and a youthful healthy sexuality rather modest by today s standards but liberating for the times _meta_end_dot_

 after changing his mind on using the professional actors he had cast chukhrai picked two very young unknown acting students matching a prototypical blond open faced and handsome russian everyman with a ukrainian named slavic beauty her luminous eyes pouty lips full figure and long glorious hair are often filmed with a halo effect _meta_end_dot_

 in one of the film s most poignant scenes alyosha s and shura s faces and her billowing hair are superimposed over the pure russian birch forest the train is passing as they are finally able to exchange their unspoken expressions of love _meta_end_dot_

 most likely the change applebaum is trying to explain is just something that hasn t actually changed _meta_end_dot_

 instead part of the cold war dynamic was that most of the russians a westerner might see or interact with were government officials who tended to be middle aged men rather than attractive young women _meta_end_dot_

 the idea that the communist party somehow managed to create a society in which there was no market for female beauty is pretty fantastical about on a par with the notion that the party was going to create a new soviet man _meta_end_dot_
