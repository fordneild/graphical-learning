  clinton wins _meta_end_dot_

 it seems to me though that this state was too close to produce a substantial delegate lead and much the same will be true no matter who wins in connecticut _meta_end_dot_

 the networks delegate math is however significantly lagging behind their ability to call the states _meta_end_dot_

 that said the mere fact of the lag seems to me to be hurting obama at this point since the states as such get called with great fanfare _meta_end_dot_

 it may take us until sometime tomorrow to actually piece together what happened with the delegates _meta_end_dot_
