  i haven t really known what to say about this but my maternal grandmother helen yglesias died early friday morning _meta_end_dot_

 it s a sad thing to have happen but she was an old woman born in _meta_number_ref_ had been ailing and went peacefully and comfortably after a full and successful life _meta_end_dot_

 like my father and his father she was a writer and published several novels after an unusually late debut in her fifties _meta_end_dot_

 previously she worked at literary editor at the nation so you can see that the family is slowly moving right and selling out over time _meta_end_dot_

 there are a couple of brief biographies available online for those who are interested here and here though of course it s always slightly bizarre to read a professional account of someone like your own grandmother who you came to know and love at an early age when you didn t know anything about this sort of thing _meta_end_dot_

 nevertheless she led a fairly inspiring life when you get right down to it always committed to her passions _meta_end_dot_
