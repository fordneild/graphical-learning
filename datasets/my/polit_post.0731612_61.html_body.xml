  david ignatius reports from jerusalem efraim halevy the former head of the israeli intelligence agency mossad titled his memoirs man in the shadows but now that he s out in the sunlight the _meta_number_ref_ year old retired spy chief has some surprisingly contrarian things to say about iran and syria _meta_end_dot_

 the gist of his message is that rather than constantly ratcheting up the rhetoric of confrontation the united states and israel should be looking for ways to establish a creative dialogue with these adversaries _meta_end_dot_
