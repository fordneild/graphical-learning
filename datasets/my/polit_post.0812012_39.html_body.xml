  in case you needed my opinion to figure this out reverend wright doesn t seem to be doing his former parishoner any favors choosing instead to hog as much of the spotlight as possible reiterate the most objectionable of his greatest hits and i guess just see what john mccain can do with this _meta_end_dot_

 one supposes this ll lead to a more open breach between wright and obama which might help the latter in the long run but it s a pretty depressing mess at this point _meta_end_dot_
