  i think it bears mentioning that in my view the debate that s broken out in comments here and periodically elsewhere around the web as to whether or not it took any particular political courage for barack obama to oppose the war in the fall of _meta_number_ref_ is a bit irrelevant _meta_end_dot_

 whatever you may say about hillary clinton pro or con she obviously didn t take the position she did on iraq because of short term political calculations _meta_end_dot_

 clinton wasn t up for re election until _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 for people in her position the cynical calculus and the substantive calculus wound up giving very similar answers _meta_end_dot_

 for clinton the politically smart thing to do was to make her best judgment as to whether or not a vote for war would look smart in retrospect and vote accordingly _meta_end_dot_

 someone in obama s position didn t face any real political risks in any direction _meta_end_dot_

 but the only cynical reason to speak out strongly against the war would have been a conviction that such speaking out would look smart in retrospect _meta_end_dot_

 basically political and substantive judgments track very closely _meta_end_dot_

 it s different for someone facing the max cleland scenario of a tough _meta_number_ref_ re election battle where you might really think that an invasion would be a long run disaster but that you had no choice other than to support it _meta_end_dot_

 neither clinton nor obama were in that position _meta_end_dot_

 both could have gotten away with saying or doing just about anything _meta_end_dot_

 but both were ambitious people looking to do things that would look smart in the medium to long run _meta_end_dot_

 and only obama did in fact do something that looks smart in retrospect _meta_end_dot_

 to mention the book once again one argument i make is that while it s hardly a law of nature that good policy is good politics when it comes to something like iraq it s really difficult to get the politics right in a vacuum _meta_end_dot_

 it makes a ton of sense even in the most cynical possible terms to try to build your political strategy on a foundation of sound substantive judgment _meta_end_dot_
