  i heard a liberal obama skeptic remark a couple of months ago that it would be a strange day in america when the correct answer to the question who s the most electable was the black guy i think that s right and it s a reminder that though the clich is to say that democrats are torn between two very strong candidates in some ways we re torn between two very weak ones _meta_end_dot_

 at the end of the day i do think the black guy is the more electable of the two because bill clinton s less charismatic wife is an almost uniquely poor choice to try to expand the democratic party s appeal at a time when george w _meta_end_dot_

 bush has brought the gop into discredit _meta_end_dot_

 but in a primary election where clinton has formidable strength it would have been extremely difficult for anyone other than the black guy to build a viable anti clinton coalition _meta_end_dot_

 given the extreme strong underlying pro democrat fundamentals it s very hard for me to imagine how a generic democratic white dude like chris dodd or john edwards or indeed john kerry would lose in this environment _meta_end_dot_

 now of course given that white men are a pretty tiny slice of the democratic coalition at this point sooner or later the party is going to need to start nominating more women and non white in competitive races or else they ll be shutting themselves off from too much of the available talent see e g obama s formidable speech giving skills so it s probably just as well to spend a year with good fundamentals taking a chance and breaking down some barriers _meta_end_dot_
