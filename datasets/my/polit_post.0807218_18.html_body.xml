  i suppose i should link to the official elliot spitzer resignation story _meta_end_dot_

 it s too bad _meta_end_dot_

 he was a very promising very solid political leader _meta_end_dot_

 what s more as we watch the would be first woman president square off against the would be first black president i won t deny having hoped on some level that spitzer could be the first jewish president someday _meta_end_dot_

 but most indications are that david paterson will be a good governor and a good leader for new york state liberals so given the damage already done to spitzer s resignation it s hard not to see this move as for the best _meta_end_dot_
