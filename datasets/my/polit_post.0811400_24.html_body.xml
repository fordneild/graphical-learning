  i have to say that i m getting really tired of this _meta_end_dot_

 all the superdelegates should just say who they re voting for and bring this to the end _meta_end_dot_

 if they want to back hillary clinton despite obama s majority in elected delegates they should say so _meta_end_dot_

 or if they want barack obama to be the nominee they should say so _meta_end_dot_

 the idea that in two weeks we ll have another inconclusive primary then another then another then another and then the superdelegates make up their mind is inane everyone else who follows politics can decide _meta_end_dot_
