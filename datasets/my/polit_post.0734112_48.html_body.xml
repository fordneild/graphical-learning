  rob goodspeed posts several charts regarding metro ridership here in the washington dc area _meta_end_dot_

 this one illustrates the growth in ridership at the relatively new green line stations around where i live _meta_end_dot_

 the steady growth is impressive and tends to illustrate the point that if you build it they will come especially if you build it properly which is what s happened here _meta_end_dot_

 the way columbia heights ridership started out slightly lower than petworth s but is now rocketing ahead also shows the virtues of allowing intensive development something i d like too see even more of in that area where right now it s basically restricted by law not by lack of demand to _meta_number_ref_th street _meta_end_dot_
