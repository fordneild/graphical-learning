  alyssa the los angeles times is reporting that california senate republicans have blocked a plan to build new health care facilities in the state s prisons and are going to block a proposed settlement of a prison overcrowding lawsuit _meta_end_dot_

 these are in every possible way pretty terrible ideas _meta_end_dot_

 the prison system is in receivership and the receiver says he ll raid the state coffers to pay for prison hospitals if he has to _meta_end_dot_

 without the settlement the lawsuit will go to court where the judges have the option of freeing large numbers of prisoners which the republican senators have said they will appeal to the u s _meta_end_dot_

 supreme court _meta_end_dot_

 look i like a howe hummelesque mass prisoner release on a technicality story as much as anyone but letting one happen in this case seems to serve not puckishness but political grandstanding _meta_end_dot_

 and it s particularly disturbing given that the _meta_dollor_ref_ billion the court receiver wants for prison hospitals would be aimed at providing beds for prisoners with long term medical problems and mental illnesses _meta_end_dot_

 while the bush administration has always insisted that there are clear distinctions between prisoners being held in gitmo and those in the general prison population i wonder how the existence of gitmo and prisons in iraq and afghanistan affects american prison administration _meta_end_dot_

 even before the administration started playing by a very different set of rules for war on terror prisoners jail in the united states sounded like a terrifying place to be in any capacity _meta_end_dot_

 but i wonder if gitmo s existence and use have made it easier for prison administrators to draw a harder line on prisoner treatment or if our treatment of prisoners of war has made domestic incarceration look good by comparison and blunted prison reform as an issue _meta_end_dot_
