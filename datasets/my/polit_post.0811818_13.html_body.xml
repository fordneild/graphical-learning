  tyler cowen argues that restrictions on trade in and sale of agricultural commodities are contributing to the current food crisis _meta_end_dot_

 the result of all these various protections and restrictions is to reduce overall production and to create an inefficient market where it s relatively difficult to get goods to where they re needed _meta_end_dot_

 this is all why i find it difficult to get too upset one way or the other about things like cafta or the colombia trade deal _meta_end_dot_

 the real gains to be realized from further liberalization of trade at this point have to do with farm stuff that s been kept off the table in all these negotiations _meta_end_dot_
