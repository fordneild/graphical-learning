  tim lee delves deeper into the myseriously low proportion of trade in the text of the us colombia trade deal _meta_end_dot_

 this has of course become utterly typical _meta_end_dot_

 i wish people were more aware of this reality _meta_end_dot_

 some of these deals may be good for america others may be bad and yet others like this one probably just won t make much of a difference either way _meta_end_dot_

 but however you want to argue the merits of any particular deal reference to a trade model out of an economics textbook is neither here nor there _meta_end_dot_

 dan drezner explains that the deal is really about cementing the us colombian bilateral relationship _meta_end_dot_

 maybe so _meta_end_dot_

 i would just observe that free traders spend a lot of time rending garments over the alleged ignorance of their protectionist adversaries but seem to have remarkably little time for self scrutiny about all the dishonesty and funny business that goes into the forming and passing of these agreements _meta_end_dot_

 as i wrote initially i m all for lowering american barriers to imported goods but it s hard for me to see an agreement like this one as particularly germane to that issue _meta_end_dot_
