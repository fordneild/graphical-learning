  i only recently became aware that john mccain doesn t know how to use a computer _meta_end_dot_

 i suppose it s not that shocking a lot of people his age aren t necessarily adept with newish technologies and a u s _meta_end_dot_

 senator is in a position to have his computing done for him _meta_end_dot_

 still i could see having some concerns about the leadership of someone who doesn t use the dominant new technology of our time _meta_end_dot_

 eve fairbanks reports that mark soohoo deputy e campaign manager for mccain had this to say on the matter at the personal democracy forum you don t necessarily have to use a computer to understand you know how it shapes the country _meta_end_dot_

 john mccain is aware of the internet _meta_end_dot_

 i dunno _meta_end_dot_

 do you have to use a computer to understand how it shapes the country _meta_end_question_

 i think you might _meta_end_dot_

 if we had a president who didn t know how to drive a car that would probably strike us as pretty odd _meta_end_dot_

 but i think you could plausibly claim that you don t necessarily have to have a driver s license in order to understand how automobiles shape the country _meta_end_dot_

 but that s because we assume that even someone who doesn t have a license has still been in cars sees highways onramps and offramps parking lots quiet winding roads overpasses bridges etc _meta_end_dot_

 if you hadn t done any of that stuff then i think it really would be difficult to understand the implications of the technology _meta_end_dot_

 but while people ride as passengers in cars all the time i would imagine that someone who doesn t use a computer doesn t peer over the shoulder of his staff either _meta_end_dot_

 and under those circumstances i think it really might be difficult to understand _meta_end_dot_

 but of course that s a defeasible assumption mccain could say something really insightful about information technology and its implications for politics and society and i guess we d have to say wow that was smart but i don t think he s done so and i don t think i m going to hold my breath waiting _meta_end_dot_
