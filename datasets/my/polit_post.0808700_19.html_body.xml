  i have to say that i doubt threatening nancy pelosi to take their toys and go home if she doesn t urge superdelegates to do what they want is really the smartest way for hillary clinton supporters to try to win this election _meta_end_dot_

 it sort of re enforces the case that the clintons and their close allies are selfish people willing and ready to destroy the party in order to maintain control over it _meta_end_dot_
