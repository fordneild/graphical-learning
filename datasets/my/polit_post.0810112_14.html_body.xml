  george borjas every immigration restrictionist s favorite economist has a post up suggesting we look to japan where they re planning to massively scale up the use of robots as an alternative to the immigration of unskilled labor _meta_end_dot_

 that sounds like a great alternative if you don t care about the interests of immigrants themselves at all and are also willing to overlook the fact that once we become dependent on robot labor they re going to rebel and enslave us _meta_end_dot_

 one really needs to wonder whose side borjas is on _meta_end_dot_
