  as you can perhaps tell from my dyspeptic response to some of our ideas festival sponsors efforts to brand themselves as green see also boeing s hilarious hand crank powered flashlight i don t see the corporate social responsibility movement as having a ton of promise _meta_end_dot_

 i think large firms will more or less inevitably seek to maximize profits and the role of the state is to ensure that that profit maximizing behavior takes place in a larger framework such that its impacts are beneficial _meta_end_dot_

 but this is a practical concern and i absolutely agree with brad delong that the strong anti csr position outlined by milton friedman and others doesn t make much sense and actually seems blind to the non coercive genius of capitalism _meta_end_dot_
