  patrick healy reports for the new york times senator hillary rodham clinton and her advisers increasingly believe that after a series of losses she has been boxed into a must win position in the ohio and texas primaries on march _meta_number_ref_ and she has begun reassuring anxious donors and superdelegates that the nomination is not slipping away from her aides said on monday _meta_end_dot_

 fair enough _meta_end_dot_

 on the other hand texas and ohio combined have just a bit fewer delegates than do the obama weekend sweep states plus the potomac primary states so it s not clear that even a texas and ohio win would put her over the top _meta_end_dot_

 meanwhile as i noted this morning we haven t seen any polls from texas or ohio and the idea that clinton is leading in those places is best on pure conjecture _meta_end_dot_
