  this john pekkanen article in washingtonian is really good _meta_end_dot_

 fortunately it was also given a really good subtitle so i can just quote it rather than thinking up my own summary after years of health warnings fewer americans are smoking _meta_end_dot_

 but while washington is encouraging americans to quit it has been helping big tobacco push cigarette smoking in other countries using trade pacts to force poorer nations to accept american cigarettes and helping cause an epidemic of health related problems read the whole thing _meta_end_dot_
