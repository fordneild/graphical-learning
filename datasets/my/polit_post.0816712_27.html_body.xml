  i m not sure i agree with the specific claims jonathan cohn is making here about sebelius and webb but he does make the correct meta level point which is that it s a huge mistake for activists and so forth to think about the veepstakes primarily as a question of short term political tactics _meta_end_dot_

 becoming vice president of the united states dramatically increases the odds that you ll become president down the road so it s actually really important more important than is generally recognized that the person who s picked be someone who s substantively good _meta_end_dot_
