  another one from yesterday s requests thread implications of the mormon grassroots mobilization if romney gets picked to be mccain s vp _meta_end_dot_

 i say it makes nevada and colorado tougher for the democrats to pick up and michigan also though not so much for the lds factor i think that s right _meta_end_dot_

 there s also the potential that mormon mobilization could put oregon back in play _meta_end_dot_

 you saw from the mccain clinton matchup polling that mccain s not per se unacceptable to oregon and the state has a much larger mormon population than people realize _meta_end_dot_

 on the other hand given the fact that evangelicals are already less than ecstatic about mccain adding romney make that problem even worse and hurt mccain in ohio virginia and elsewhere that the gop counts on mobilizing these voters _meta_end_dot_

 more generally romney seems to be a figure who most americans find despicable which makes him a problematic vp choice _meta_end_dot_
