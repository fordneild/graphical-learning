  apparently key members of john mccain s staff were urging him to take a one term pledge back in april of _meta_number_ref_ and the candidate was on board to the extent that such a pledge was set to be the central thread of his presidential campaign and mark salter mccain s chief speechwriter crafted an announcement speech around it but at the last minute mccain changed his mind _meta_end_dot_

 so i suppose this means that mccain s inner circle thinks he s not up for a second term _meta_end_question_
