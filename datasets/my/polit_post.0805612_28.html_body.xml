  just like a real fake journalist i spent some time on a conference call this morning with some of barack obama s people and can now faithfully recount to you the audience what they told me _meta_end_dot_

 one by way of prebuttal to a foreign policy speech hillary clinton will deliver today susan rice outlined three key missteps of judgment she said clinton had made supporting the invasion of iraq support that rice emphasized was not limited to _meta_number_ref_ but extended for several additional years _meta_end_dot_

 voting to give the president the benefit of the doubt on iran by voting for the kyl lieberman amendment agreeing with bush and mccain on a musharraf centric approach to pakistan that short cited point of view which underplayed the importance of the democracy movement in pakistan backfired and has left us scrambling to convince the pakistani people that our interests in pakistan extend beyond one man scott gration then said a bunch of stuff that i didn t think was very interesting _meta_end_dot_

 then richard danzig emphasized that the obama campaign s theme of change extends not just to the domestic world but also very strikingly to the foreign policy world he alleged that senator clinton is trapped within an establishment view of the world at a time when we hugely need to present a new face to the world but not just a new face in the superficial sense danzig said we need to present a new face to the world through some dramatic new substantive policies _meta_end_dot_

 he highlighted in particular obama s focus on non proliferation issues and willingness to support dramatic multi lateral arsenal cuts and specifically commit to a long range goal of zero nuclear weapons _meta_end_dot_

 this last bit had resonance for me because i think it s been one of the big under reported issue arguments of the campaign _meta_end_dot_

 barack obama and john edwards both specifically endorsed the kissinger nunn perry shultz call for a zero nukes policy _meta_end_dot_

 clinton neither embraced nor rejected that view instead choosing to mischaracterize the issue by writing that former secretaries of state george shultz and henry kissinger former defense secretary william perry and former senator sam nunn have called on the united states to rekindle the vision shared by every president from dwight eisenhower to bill clinton of reducing reliance on nuclear weapons that s just not what they called on us to do and i d sort of like to know what clinton thinks about the issue at hand _meta_end_dot_

 and yes it s weird to cite agreeing with these four very establishmentarian figures as an example of obama being willing to buck the establishment _meta_end_dot_

 in other news i felt that rice was using a sarcastic tone of voice to convey frustration with the fact that clinton s campaign has been allowed to get away with waiting until very late in the game to deliver her major foreign policy address while also billing herself the candidate of substance _meta_end_dot_

 rice also emphasized the idea that clinton is trying to have it both ways on the experience issue claiming full partnership in her husband s presidency as a sign of readiness to be commander in chief while also wanting to distance herself from things like nafta that may be unpopular today _meta_end_dot_

 i thought the hypocrisy allegation sort of lacked bite _meta_end_dot_

 rice and several other obama advisors worked in the clinton administration _meta_end_dot_

 if they want to say that in their experience clinton didn t play the sort of substantive role she s now saying she played they ought to come out and say so directly _meta_end_dot_

 they were there and we weren t and there s no contradiction between having been involved and sometimes losing a policy argument _meta_end_dot_

 nota bene this sort of big time journalism talking to important people on the phone can be done while wearing pajamas from the privacy of your own home _meta_end_dot_
