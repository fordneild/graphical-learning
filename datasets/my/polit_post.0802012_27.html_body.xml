  to revise and extend my remarks on the hussein factor from yesterday i think part of my point would be that there s really no use in deploring somewhat underhanded attacks in the course of a primary campaign _meta_end_dot_

 part of the idea of a primary is for the eventual winner to be someone who s tested _meta_end_dot_

 in those terms i actually think the race thus far has been too nice in a lot of ways _meta_end_dot_

 there s a lot more stuff about barack obama s afrocentric church that the republican party is virtually certain to use against him if he becomes the nominee so under the circumstances i d sort of prefer to have hillary clinton s people bring it up and see if obama can perform well in the midst of the freak show _meta_end_dot_

 similarly i ve heard it said that so much shit s already been slung in hillary clinton s direction that the american people have already heard it all and won t be further impressed by anything they hear _meta_end_dot_

 i think that s a bit naive _meta_end_dot_

 relatively few people remember for example when bill clinton pardoned some puerto rican terrorists in the midst of her _meta_number_ref_ senate campaign but i m pretty damn sure the rnc research team remembers _meta_end_dot_

 i don t want to dwell on this sort of thing personally but insofar as i think it s bound to get dwelled on sooner or later i d tend to vote for sooner as the best time to hear about it all _meta_end_dot_
