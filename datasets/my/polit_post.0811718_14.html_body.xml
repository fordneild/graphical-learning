  as a shaq trade skeptic i was feeling vindicated by the initial set of post trade suns games _meta_end_dot_

 but then phoenix went on a nice run and the trade s advocates were feeling vindicated _meta_end_dot_

 i held to the true faith and i think i ve been vindicated as phoenix has now managed to go down _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ against san antonio even though the reconfigured squad was allegedly designed specifically to match up against the spurs and even though this looks like a weaker spurs team than what they ve given us in recent years _meta_end_dot_
