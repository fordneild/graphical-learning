  i think the redskins can take seattle today _meta_end_dot_

 dc s played much better than the seahawks in recent weeks and i think seattle s nfc west schedule has been pretty weak _meta_end_dot_

 i d feel more confident though if not for the whole home field advantage thing _meta_end_dot_

 that makes it a very close matchup _meta_end_dot_

 still no reason a skins fan shouldn t feel optimistic _meta_end_dot_

 as thomas boswell writes in all washington coped with seven games against teams that are in the playoffs and four others against _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ teams wheres played nine games against teams with a losing record along these lines expect me to miss whichever of this evening s debates conflicts with the redskins game
