  i m up outrageously early on a saturday because i m about to head off to see nancy pelosi talk to the netroots nation _meta_end_dot_

 i don t attend _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ am events on a saturday lightly so i think it s time to once again remind people that whatever disappointments they may have with the new democratic congress and its leadership that at the end of the day among real liberals in washington dc pelosi is by far the most powerful _meta_end_dot_

 and among powerful elected officials in washington pelosi is the real liberal _meta_end_dot_

 there s a reason she s the one who shows up to an event like this even when she s not courting the base in a primary _meta_end_dot_
