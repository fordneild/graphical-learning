  i ll happily admit that i m not much of a charitable donor one way or the other _meta_end_dot_

 still i m always a bit flabbergasted by the fundraising solicitations i get from harvard _meta_end_dot_

 it seems to me that insofar as i give money away it should be directed at an institution that actually helps people in need _meta_end_dot_

 as kevin carey puts it as richard vedder pointed out in the post over the weekend princeton recently built a new residence facility whitman college named after major donor and alumna meg whitman ceo of ebay which cost a staggering _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ per unit roughly what donald trump spends building a luxury resort _meta_end_dot_

 here we have a fabulously wealthy person donating money to a fabously wealthy university to built a fabulously expensive facility for the benefit of students who come from in many cases very wealthy families _meta_end_dot_

 i have no problem with that personally if that s how they want to spend their money but why am i as a taxpayer footing part of the bill _meta_end_question_

 i m not _meta_number_ref_ percent sure on the best remedy _meta_end_dot_

 tyler cowen argues fairly persuasively in good and plenty that the u s _meta_end_dot_

 tax code s scattershot approach to subsidizing charitable donations is a very effective form of arts subsidy for a diverse society _meta_end_dot_

 and i think it would be pretty reductive to say that it would be a good thing if all of our donor supported museums ballets symphonies aquariums zoos libraries classics departments etc _meta_end_dot_

 all shut down and had their funds redirected to soup kitchens and drug treatment programs _meta_end_dot_

 to me to figure this out we d need to have some serious estimates about the impact of restricting charitable deductions _meta_end_dot_

 how much new tax revenue are we talking about _meta_end_question_

 if we kept the deduction in place for institutions aimed at helping the poor how much charity would be redirected in their direction _meta_end_question_

 but how difficult would it be to administer a rule like that _meta_end_question_

 how much would giving to cultural institutions decline _meta_end_question_

 it s a lot of thorny policy questions _meta_end_dot_

 but it d certainly be my advice to any super rich people out there that if you re considering making a large charitable donation in the near future a big gift to an ivy league university is one of the least socially useful applications of your cash imaginable _meta_end_dot_
