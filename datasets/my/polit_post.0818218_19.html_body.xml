  via kevin drum i see that a group of american advisers led by a small state department team played an integral part in drawing up contracts between the iraqi government and five major western oil companies to develop some of the largest fields in iraq american officials say there s more to the war than this kind of thing but it s naive to deny that this kind of thing plays a large role in providing the impetus for a continued american involvement _meta_end_dot_

 but more important it s crucial to recall that this sort of thing renders the us military presence in iraq a destabilizing force in that country _meta_end_dot_

 our troops aren t merely a destabilizing force it s clear that in many respects they re providing order especially local order _meta_end_dot_

 but at the same time the fact of american occupation generates a structure cause of disorder that saps the iraqi government of illegitimacy and given our poor relations with iraq s key neighbors turns the country into a field for proxy battles _meta_end_dot_
