  pew reports on the national popular vote movement gaining steam with npv proposals having passed in maryland new jersey hawaii and illinois with bills on the move in massachusetts new york north carolina and rhode island _meta_end_dot_

 the way this works is that an npv state commits to giving its electoral votes to the winner of the national popular vote if and only if states possessing a total of _meta_number_ref_ electoral votes agree to do the same _meta_end_dot_

 this will if enough states sign on provide a backdoor way of transitioning to electing the president via popular vote without going through the all but impossible article v amendment process _meta_end_dot_

 thus far obviously you re seeing npv pass in liberal states _meta_end_dot_

 but some cycle or other something will happen that gets conservatives worried about this _meta_end_dot_

 and there are plenty of right wing states texas oklahoma georgia mississippi alabama south carolina that are too big to benefit from the electoral college s overweighting of small states and whose interests currently get ignored in presidential campaigns since they re not battlegrounds
