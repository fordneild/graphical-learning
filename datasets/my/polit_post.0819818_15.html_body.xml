  ezra klein has an interesting tap article looking at some of the social science on why there are relatively few women holding elected office in the united states _meta_end_dot_

 it turns out that women who run for office do just as well as male candidates but women are much less likely to run _meta_end_dot_

 there are various sources of this but the most easily fixable one is that women are much less likely to be recruited _meta_end_dot_

 this is a particular problem for liberals since most liberals in america are women meaning that sexist biases in candidate recruitment are going to deprive liberalism of a lot of possible recruits _meta_end_dot_
