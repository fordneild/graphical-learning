  as i noted this morning the new hampshire polls didn t actually get the level of support for barack obama wrong _meta_end_dot_

 instead they undercounted hillary clinton s supporters _meta_end_dot_

 how d that happen _meta_end_question_

 jay carney has friends of friends who have the answer he didn t find any evidence that white respondents who were telling pollsters they planned to vote for obama did not _meta_end_dot_

 what he found instead is that a certain percentage of democratic voters in the last days of polling presumed biden especially and to a lesser degree dodd hadn t dropped out _meta_end_dot_

 by and large come election day those biden and dodd supporters ended up casting ballots for hillary _meta_end_dot_

 also of the _meta_number_ref_ percent or so who were still undecideds in the last polls almost all broke for hillary _meta_end_dot_

 and a tiny percentage of edwards supporters switched to hillary _meta_end_dot_

 when you think about it this makes perfect sense _meta_end_dot_

 obama got _meta_number_ref_ percent of the vote in iowa _meta_end_dot_

 not only is iowa only one small state but _meta_number_ref_ percent of the vote is way less than half _meta_end_dot_

 nevertheless based on that plurality he was about to march to the nomination _meta_end_dot_

 as a result while obama continued to hold his own in terms of his baseline level of support all the uncommitted people supporters of minor candidates undecideds some soft edwards people voted for clinton to keep the race going _meta_end_dot_

 in iowa a similar dynamic probably helped obama _meta_end_dot_

 people knew that a clinton win might end the competition so obama can so to speak the benefit of the doubt _meta_end_dot_

 unlike most political bloggers most voters haven t been following this thing since the first quarter of _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 a lot of them want to see how the competition plays out _meta_end_dot_
