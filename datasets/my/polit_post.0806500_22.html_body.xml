  no call on ohio _meta_end_dot_

 that seems like good news for obama indicating that any delegate lead coming out of ohio will be very small and making it extremely unlikely that clinton will make any kind of meaningful dent in obama s delegate lead _meta_end_dot_

 the bluster on television is that she s going to stay in even if it s mathematically impossible for her to make up the delegate gap but i don t see what kind of sense that makes _meta_end_dot_

 i mean if she can t possibly win she can t possibly win _meta_end_dot_
