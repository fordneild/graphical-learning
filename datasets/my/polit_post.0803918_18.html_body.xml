 the salient fact about competition and health insurance isn t that one can t imagine policies that would create a more effectively competitive insurance market the problem is simply that decent people think the results of such a market would be undesirable _meta_end_dot_

 electronics companies make gadgets that people want at a cost cheap enough for them to afford them _meta_end_dot_

 restaurants offer tasty food enjoyable ambiance efficient service etc _meta_end_dot_

 but what well functioning insurance companies do is assess risk accurately _meta_end_dot_

 and the general premise of health care policies in most countries is that health care should be delivered to people who need health care _meta_end_dot_
