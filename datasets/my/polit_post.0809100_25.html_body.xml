  james fallows points to an affecting example of china s continued impoverishment as reason why who worry about china as the all conquering juggernaut that has coped with every internal challenge and is sitting around thinking about how to take over the world are off base _meta_end_dot_

 and certainly there s something to that _meta_end_dot_

 but in other respects it s the still in many ways bleak reality of contemporary china that makes it seem threatening _meta_end_dot_

 if the prc is such a juggernaut now what s it going to be like when the average chinese person is say half as rich as the average american _meta_end_question_

 and that china is still going to see itself as a relatively poor country that owes little to the world but is owed much from it _meta_end_dot_

 depending on what kind of things you re inclined to worry about that can look like a looming environmental catastrophe a looming national security catastrophe or probably one of any number of other kind of catastrophes _meta_end_dot_

 of course the flipside is that it s also a great opportunity for a huge number of people to escape grinding poverty _meta_end_dot_

 as such it s difficult for me to let my outlook be dominated by worry _meta_end_dot_

 but i think i do see what the worriers are worried about _meta_end_dot_
