  here s a tidbit from john mccain s balanced budget plan balance the budget requires slowing outlay growth to _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ percent _meta_end_dot_

 the roughly _meta_dollor_ref_ billion dollars by _meta_number_ref_ in slower spending growth come from reduced deployments abroad _meta_dollor_ref_ billion consistent with success in iraq afghanistan that permits deployments to be cut by half hopefully more james kvaal and robert gordon note that this only adds up if you assume a total withdrawal _meta_end_dot_

 for one thing u s _meta_end_dot_

 spending in iraq and afghanistan totaled _meta_dollor_ref_ billion in _meta_number_ref_ according to the congressional budget office and that includes money for iraqi security forces foreign aid and veterans benefits similarly according to cbo rapidly reducing the number of troops in iraq and afghanistan to _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ would save only _meta_dollor_ref_ billion in _meta_number_ref_ and obama s own more aggressive plan to withdraw forces from iraq will save only _meta_dollor_ref_ billion a year according to his campaign to obtain the sort of savings mccain is counting on in other words would require a much more aggressive withdrawal plan than the one he opposes as too aggressive _meta_end_dot_
