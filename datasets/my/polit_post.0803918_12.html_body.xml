  it seems this film which i saw a screening of a few months ago is opening tonight in dc _meta_end_dot_

 i believe that means it s already been available in new york and la and may or may not be coming to a city near you _meta_end_dot_

 but if it is playing near you you should definitely check it out _meta_end_dot_

 there ve been a lot of dumb war on terror related films released over the past couple of years lame efforts to do fiction as polemic _meta_end_dot_

 this is different _meta_end_dot_

 it s a documentary it s brilliantly well executed and it not only presents and argument but it does so in an emotionally searing way it s about torture so it s not exactly the most fun friday plan you could imagine but it s a great important film and you should really check it out _meta_end_dot_
