  here s a fascinating result via henry farrell and larry bartels book unequal democracy _meta_end_dot_

 as you can see among people with low levels of political information as measured by knowing things like which party had more members in the house or which party was more conservative liberals and conservatives alike are aware that inequality between rich and poor has grown in recent decades _meta_end_dot_

 when you shift from low information liberals to high information liberals the proportion of liberals getting the inequality facts right goes up _meta_end_dot_

 but when you shift from low information conservatives to high information conservatives you see evidence not of growing awareness of the facts but of growing familiarity with conservative talking points and thus a decreasing proclivity to answer the question correctly _meta_end_dot_

 and i seriously doubt things would turn out any differently if you found a question where the shoe was on the other foot _meta_end_dot_

 this relates to the skepticism i expressed last week that the flip flopper allegation really hurt john kerry quite as much as it sometimes appears _meta_end_dot_

 there s a lot of evidence from various sources that what happens when people pay attention to politics is they better align self reports of their beliefs with the talking points associated with their side so you can get a lot of people claiming to dislike john kerry because he s a flip flopper when more likely they think kerry s a flip flopper because they don t like john kerry and that s what kerry s enemies were saying _meta_end_dot_

 if conservatives had decided to say that kerry was stubborn huge numbers of people would have believed that instead _meta_end_dot_
