  i feel as if it wouldn t be too shocking if barack obama really did manage to close the gap and win new york city _meta_end_dot_

 after all it s pretty demographically friendly terrain for him sizable black population plenty of highly educated whites few mexican americans and it s not as if hillary clinton has particularly deep roots in new york _meta_end_dot_

 what s more connecticut and new jersey are both demographically promising areas for obama with democratic parties that consist primarily of african americans and educated people _meta_end_dot_

 but throughout the tri state area obama s playing at a disadvantage because clinton represents new york and has ties to political leaders throughout the region _meta_end_dot_

 it should however be interesting to see how close obama can keep things throughout that area _meta_end_dot_
