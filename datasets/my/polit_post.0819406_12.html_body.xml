  i m quite a bit too young to remember the last time we had major banks failing in this country and i ll admit that it s pretty unsettling _meta_end_dot_

 brad delong gives me some confidence that the appropriate people have the tools and judgment necessary to prevent things from getting too bad _meta_end_dot_

 but who knows i m kind of an optimist by nature and optimism hasn t been paying off well lately _meta_end_dot_
