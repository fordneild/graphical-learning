  if you don t bike at all for years and years and then go buy a bike and ride _meta_number_ref_ miles a day for two days in a row you wind up with very sore legs _meta_end_dot_

 i suppose if i d thought this through i could have switched off the arc trainer in the gym and used the stationary bike instead to get prepared but i m not really big on thinking things through _meta_end_dot_

 so for now ouch _meta_end_exclamation_
