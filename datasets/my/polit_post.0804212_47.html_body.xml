  the army asked the rand corporation to do a kind of lessons learned report on iraq soon after the invasion _meta_end_dot_

 in the summer of _meta_number_ref_ after _meta_number_ref_ months of study rebuilding iraq was done _meta_end_dot_

 rand submitted a classified version and an unclassified version hoping that its publication would contribute to the public debate on how to prepare for future conflicts naturally the report was critical of the conduct of the white house and the defense department since the whole thing had turned into a huge disaster so any useful review would need to be critical of the key people _meta_end_dot_

 apparently what happened next was that the army launched a big effort to suppress the report and keep its findings secret _meta_end_dot_

 because hey why seek to inform the public when there are asses to cover _meta_end_question_
