  as matt stoller notes there s a remarkable effort under way to excise the debate over the wisdom of the iraq war from the democratic primary _meta_end_dot_

 certainly there was more than that one issue in play _meta_end_dot_

 nevertheless it s essentially unprecedented for a challenger to unseat an establishment figure as well entrenched as clinton and it s very clear to me that it was the war issue that gave obama a plausible opening to mount a challenge _meta_end_dot_

 the war alone didn t and couldn t have put obama over the top but it s what create a base of discontent with the inevitable clinton and what allowed an alternative to get a hearing _meta_end_dot_

 and that s an important development a world in which clinton became the nominee would be a world in which there was no conceivable political upside to opposing any war ever _meta_end_dot_
