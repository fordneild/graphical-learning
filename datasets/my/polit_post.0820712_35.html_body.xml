  fred kaplan has a good column trying to move beyond john mccain s many gaffes and get at the point that despite his war hero background his ideas about foreign policy are terrible _meta_end_dot_

 i do however think it s a bit unfortunate that the piece has been titled how much does john mccain really know about foreign policy in general i think it s a mistake to construe the foreign policy issue as one primarily centered on attributes like knowledge experience competence credentials etc _meta_end_dot_

 that kind of thing implies that everyone more or less agrees on what our foreign policy should be like but different figures have different qualifications to run the operation _meta_end_dot_

 that s a nice idea but it s not true _meta_end_dot_

 the problem with mccain isn t with any particular gaps in his knowledge base though those seem to be there it s that his militaristic vision of america s role in the world is likely to launch a new round of great power conflict in a way that makes it impossible to address terrorism nuclear proliferation climate change etc _meta_end_dot_

 in a reasonable manner _meta_end_dot_
