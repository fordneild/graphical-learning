  kevin drum catches david freddoso blaming democrats for something democrats tried to prevent until they were blocked by the gop _meta_end_dot_

 this kind of things goes on all the time at national review and the weekly standard which is why i think thomas smith is getting a bad rap as a fabulist it s true that he wrote things for national review online that weren t true but this happens all the time _meta_end_dot_

 it s not a publication that cares in general about the accuracy of the claims its writers make so why shouldn t smith make up a fake hezbollah invasion of east beirut _meta_end_question_
