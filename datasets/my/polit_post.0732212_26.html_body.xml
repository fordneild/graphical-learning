  this seems like a weird parenthesis to put in an op ed about reagan s record on race mr _meta_end_dot_

 reagan was understandably anathema in the black community not because of his personal views but because of his consistent opposition to federal civil rights legislation most notably the landmark voting rights act of _meta_number_ref_ hitler is anathema in the jewish community not because of his personal views but because of his consistent advocacy of the eradication of europe s jewish population most notably during the landmark holocaust of the early _meta_number_ref_s _meta_end_dot_

 there s something wrong there eh _meta_end_question_

 reagan was a politician _meta_end_dot_

 his political views are what matters _meta_end_dot_

 and during the crucial civil rights fights of the mid _meta_number_ref_s reagan stood shoulder to shoulder with the forces of white supremacy _meta_end_dot_

 how important reagan s background as an anti civil rights activist was to his _meta_number_ref_ election win seems debatable i ve previously noted that it wasn t a close election and the objective facts about the late _meta_number_ref_s would have made it extremely difficult for carter to win re election under any circumstances but reagan s record is his record and his views about political issues are personal views whether or not some of his best friends were black _meta_end_dot_
