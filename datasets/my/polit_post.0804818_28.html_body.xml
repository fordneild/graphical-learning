  i liked francis fukuyama s review of samantha power s new book very much but something at the end of it reminded me of a complaint i frequently have with commentary on the future of international institutions in the end the book does not make a persuasive case that the united nations will ever be able to evolve into an organization that can deploy adequate amounts of hard power or take sides in contentious political disputes _meta_end_dot_

 its weaknesses as a bureaucracy and its political constraints make it very unlikely that the united states and other powerful countries will ever delegate to it direct control over their soldiers or trust it with large sums of money _meta_end_dot_

 i m not sure people truly grasp the force of a claim that involves the statement that something won t ever happen _meta_end_dot_

 human civilization might go on for a very long time _meta_end_dot_

 think of a person sitting around in _meta_number_ref_ speculating on what might or might not ever come to pass in the world _meta_end_dot_

 it wouldn t have even occurred to him to predict that germany and france could never reconcile because there would have been no such country as germany _meta_end_dot_

 things would need to be very different from how they are now for major countries to be putting soldiers under the direct control of un authorities but if you consider how much things have changed from _meta_number_ref_ to _meta_number_ref_ it doesn t seem at all implausible that things might indeed be very different in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 when i was in the netherlands a leading dutch pundit argued to me that the netherlands would never put its soldiers under the command of a german officer _meta_end_dot_

 i told him this exact scenario in fact already exists _meta_end_dot_

 he insisted i was wrong but fortunately bert koenders minister for development and cooperation was on hand to back me up _meta_end_dot_

 things change stuff happens people will be surprised _meta_end_dot_
