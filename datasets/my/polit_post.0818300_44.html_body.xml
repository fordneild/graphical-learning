  well i m on the ground in aspen now at the atlantic ideas festival that just happens to be taking place in aspen it s been renamed and it s really beautiful though i kind of wish there was more oxygen in the air _meta_end_dot_

 but they didn t bring me out here just to enjoy the view i m supposed to write about the ideas in play at the festival _meta_end_dot_

 so here goes _meta_end_dot_

 shelby steele offered some interesting thoughts on the subject of white guilt observing that in post white supremacist america it can be very damaging to a person or institution s reputation to be labeled as a racist _meta_end_dot_

 consequently people and institutions put a lot of emphasis on avoiding having that happen _meta_end_dot_

 this according to steele often crowds out pragmatic consideration of issues like is this actually helping people he gives vintage afdc and affirmative action as practiced at most institutions of higher education as examples practices aimed at shoring up the legitimacy of elite institutions rather than aimed at actually solving problems of poverty and structural inequities in education _meta_end_dot_

 that all seemed pretty plausible to me actually _meta_end_dot_

 then i thought he went awry by alleging that we ve been overly sensitive in our conduct of war recently for reasons of white guilt and that this is why we re bogged down in iraq too much focus on the legitimacy of our efforts and not enough focus on winning i think this mostly shows that steele has a lot more background in social policy than in military policy _meta_end_dot_

 i d say as the counterinsurgency manual says that legitimacy is absolutely vital in a modern war fighting situation _meta_end_dot_
