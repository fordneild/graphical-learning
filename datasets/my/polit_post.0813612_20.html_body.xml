  interesting conversation between tom daschle and ezra klein about health care _meta_end_dot_

 daschle of course was one of the earliest major figures to endorse obama and there are a lot of ex daschleites on obama s staff up to and including obama s chief of staff in the senate _meta_end_dot_

 daschle s take on health care policy is meanwhile somewhat sounder than what obama s put forward during the campaign though obama s plan is good on its own merits so i hope the rumors that he may play a major role in an obama administration chief of staff is what people are saying around town are true in this regard _meta_end_dot_
