  one thing that i think gets unduly neglected in a lot of political conversations especially conversations taking place within the left of center family is that one really needs to know a lot more about a person than what his income is to know what his economic interests are _meta_end_dot_

 for example the median household income in the united states is _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 but if you compare a retired person living in montana with a _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ annual income to a first year dc cop and an average aircraft painter in phoenix both of whom would earn about the same amount of money you d find three people with rather different economic interests _meta_end_dot_

 for one thing despite their similar incomes these three people are actually in rather different objective economic situations _meta_end_dot_

 but beyond that a lot of their economic interests are very narrow and specific they have to do with federal retirement programs or the state of the arizona aerospace industry or the dc government s decisions about funding priorities and the police department rather than with stuff about the economy
