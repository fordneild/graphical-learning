  dana goldstein have you noticed that throughout the course of this campaign the proper noun clintonite used since the _meta_number_ref_s to refer to bill s supporters became the simultaneously girly and threatening clintonista just sayin _meta_end_dot_

 that seems paranoid to me _meta_end_dot_

 the sandinistas and zapatistas aren t girly they re spanish speakers _meta_end_dot_

 the switch from ite to ista if it s even real surely just reflects the growing influence of the spanish language on american english as in the growing popularity of si se puede as rally chant _meta_end_dot_
