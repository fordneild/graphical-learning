  commenter steve expresses the thing that most people bring up when i mention the idea of janet napolitano on a national ticket she s single never married and doesn t seem to have much of a romantic life so she gets the same closeted lesbian rumors that dog fairly or un other never married woman politicians like condi rice or babs mikulski okay fair enough _meta_end_dot_

 but she was first elected to statewide office in arizona in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 then she won again in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 and then she won again in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 so what s the problem in practice _meta_end_question_

 it s not as if arizona s a super liberal state _meta_end_dot_

 bush got a higher proportion of the vote there than he got in nevada new mexico colorado ohio florida virginia iowa and missouri _meta_end_dot_

 compared to say hillary clinton or barack obama there s quite a lot of evidence that napolitano is a marketable commodity for the median voter _meta_end_dot_
