  sports guy sides with kareem over magic with my _meta_number_ref_ vote still up for grabs obama seized the upper hand after i read this new york times feature and learned his chief speechwriter is a red sox fan and a _meta_number_ref_ graduate from the college of the holy cross _meta_end_exclamation_

 let s see obama sounds like cyrus from the warriors he wears a nicotine patch he plays hoops he loves the wire and now the guy writing speeches for him went to the cross _meta_end_dot_

 that s pretty tough to top _meta_end_dot_

 i feel like the endorsment obama really needs though is from the sports gal plus her football picks were much better this season iirc _meta_end_dot_

 meanwhile i have the reverse reaction to revelations about red sox fans from cross _meta_end_dot_
