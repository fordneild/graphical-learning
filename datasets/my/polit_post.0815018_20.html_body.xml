  matt i d say the reason dc s ultra high end dining scene doesn t hold up to some of the country s other major cities isn t only that our area isn t as big as a new york or a chicago but also that its economic structure is too egalitarian _meta_end_dot_

 despite dc s high poverty rate the metropolitan area is one of the wealthiest in the country _meta_end_dot_

 but it s wealthy in the sense of having lots of moderately well off folks who get puzzled at the idea that _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ a year is a lot of money _meta_end_dot_

 what it doesn t have are many movie stars or hedge fund wizards or executives of huge companies _meta_end_dot_

 if you go down one ratchet from the places like per se that david park is wondering about dc is full of excellent options i like zengo capital grille ten penh jaleo dc coast but these are places that a decent swathe of washingtonians can afford to go to now and again for a special occasion _meta_end_dot_

 i find the hyper inequality on display in centers of financial services entertainment and technology is responsible for many things i find annoying but it does create some positive externalities in terms of supporting the existence of institutions that wouldn t otherwise exist _meta_end_dot_

 at the end of the day i don t think the fact that pharaoh was able to build the pyramids makes the unjust political system of ancient egypt a good idea but inequality is good for restaurants both in terms of driving demand for high end food and creating a supply of restaurant labor _meta_end_dot_
