  silly obama doesn t realize the vital importance of democracy promotion according to fred hiatt co the message that the democrat sends is that he is ultimately indifferent to the war s outcome that iraq distracts us from every threat we face and thus must be speedily evacuated regardless of the consequences _meta_end_dot_

 that s an irrational and ahistorical way to view a country at the strategic center of the middle east with some of the world s largest oil reserves _meta_end_dot_

 whether or not the war was a mistake iraq s future is a vital u s _meta_end_dot_

 security interest _meta_end_dot_

 if he is elected president mr _meta_end_dot_

 obama sooner or later will have to tailor his iraq strategy to that reality _meta_end_dot_

 oops did i say democracy promotion _meta_end_question_

 i meant to say that iraq has a lot of oil so we need to try to micromanage its future _meta_end_dot_

 and yet it s precisely this impulse the belief that we desperately need to retain influence in oil possessing parts of the world that got us into the corrupt bargain with the arab autocracies that produced the conditions under which al qaeda arose and began targeting us _meta_end_dot_

 remember when iraq was supposed to be part of a drive for reform that changed that dynamic _meta_end_question_

 oh for the heady days of the arab spring _meta_end_dot_
