  a lot of proponents of the shaq deal are now claiming vindication but while the trade s certainly worked out better for phoenix than i expected i m not at all certain they re right _meta_end_dot_

 obviously having a healthy shaq playing right now is better than having an injured shawn marion not playing _meta_end_dot_

 but if you think as most people do that the matrix could play fine were the heat not tanking then i still don t really see it _meta_end_dot_

 in march shaq offered phoenix _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ points and _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ rebounds whereas marion offered miami _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ points and _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ rebounds _meta_end_dot_

 shaq turned it over more than marion did _meta_end_dot_

 and if the trade helped phoenix s interior defense it s hurt them on the perimeter _meta_end_dot_

 so yglesias how do you explain the suns success since the trade _meta_end_question_

 well part of the answer is recalling that at the time of the trade phoenix was sitting atop the western conference with a _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ record _meta_end_dot_

 it was always a really good team _meta_end_dot_

 but since the trade amare s started taking more shots and so he s now scoring somewhat more points and the team s doing no better than it was previously _meta_end_dot_

 so while there doesn t seem to be a blunder here once you consider the cap implications it still doesn t look so hot to me _meta_end_dot_

 when you consider the fact that if phoenix s ownership had been willing to spend like this just a little while back they could have resigned kurt thomas and not sold their draft picks and they d be in even better shape today _meta_end_dot_
