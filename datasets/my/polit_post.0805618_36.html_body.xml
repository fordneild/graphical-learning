  my colleague graeme wood makes the case that we ought to harvest the organs of convicts slated for execution _meta_end_dot_

 there turn out to actually be two separate issues here _meta_end_dot_

 one though we do sentence people to be executed we never force them to give up their organs _meta_end_dot_

 but more interestingly it turns out that those sentenced to death aren t even able to volunteer to serve as organ donors post execution _meta_end_dot_

 this last bit doesn t seem defensible to me _meta_end_dot_

 on the other hand it s just very hard for me to know how to conduct moral reasoning about what is and isn t a permissible modification of a practice that should not be permitted _meta_end_dot_

 in other words given that we shouldn t be executing prisoners at all i don t really know how to respond to ideas about what things it is or isn t a good idea to do with their organs _meta_end_dot_
