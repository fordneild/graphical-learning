  i didn t see this afp story last week the iraqi officer leading a u s financed anti jihadist group is in no mood for small talk either the military gives him more money or he will pack his bags and rejoin the ranks of al qaeda _meta_end_dot_

 i ll go back to al qaeda if you stop backing the sahwa awakening groups col _meta_end_dot_

 satar tells u s _meta_end_dot_

 matthew mckernon as he tries to secure more funding for his men to help battle the anti u s _meta_end_dot_

 insurgents _meta_end_dot_

 this i think does more than a little to underscore the limits of the bribe our former enemies to be our friends approach to iraq _meta_end_dot_

 of course though the limits are real so are the possibilities _meta_end_dot_

 if keeping these guys on the payroll indefinitely were really crucial to american national security i m pretty sure we could find a way to work things out for quite a while _meta_end_dot_

 but it really isn t crucial to american national security _meta_end_dot_

 having insurgents not shooting at us troops is much preferable to the previous situation but insofar as the safety of our soldiers is the primary concern then getting the soldiers out of iraq is a much more reasonable long term strategy _meta_end_dot_

 the cash for allies approach makes sense as a way to make a military presence more sustainable in a place where the presence is strategically important _meta_end_dot_

 but for some time now the main strategic purpose of our presence in iraq seems to be simply to sustain our presence in iraq _meta_end_dot_

 that s not a good enough reason _meta_end_dot_
