  kevin drum s right that it ll take more than backbone alone to end the iraq war maybe congressional democrats need more backbone when it comes to iraq but as always it s public opinion that s key _meta_end_dot_

 and public opinion just isn t as overwhelmingly on our side as we often like to think _meta_end_dot_

 fix that and we ll all be amazed at how fast dems all grow a spine _meta_end_dot_

 but here s the thing _meta_end_dot_

 public opinion doesn t just happen effective political leaders shape public opinion _meta_end_dot_

 the polls show that the public wants a pony in iraq people don t want to beat a hasty retreat and they don t want a decade or more of occupation _meta_end_dot_

 what they want is to give the war a little more time and then for it to come to a successful conclusion _meta_end_dot_

 people in the know however realize that that s not a realistic course of action _meta_end_dot_

 the job of people who realize that it s not a realistic course of action and who favor a policy of perpetual occupation is to obscure the choices by doling the war out in friedman units and getting people to focus on the waxing and waning of the tactical situation if things get better that s a reason to keep trying if things get worse that s a reason to hold on a bit until we can turn things around _meta_end_dot_

 conversely the job of people who realize it s not a realistic course of action and who favor a policy of withdrawal and strategic reorientation is to heighten the contradictions to coin a phrase and make people realize that unless they want to commit to _meta_number_ref_ years of this we might as well leave quickly and expeditiously _meta_end_dot_

 if the leaders of the democratic party were serious about ending the war they d be trying to do this trying to shape public opinion in a strategic way _meta_end_dot_

 public opinion matters to all politicians but serious political leaders don t just take opinion in passively they try to understand it and mold it to produce a political climate favorable to the policies they re trying to push _meta_end_dot_
