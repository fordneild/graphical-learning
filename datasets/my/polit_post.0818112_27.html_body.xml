  the la times asks what such a world would look like _meta_end_dot_

 i think it s a difficult question to answer it will depend a lot on our policy response _meta_end_dot_

 clearly if we keep spending priorities and regulations in place that were formed when oil was cheap but then oil becomes massively more expensive then the results will be terrible _meta_end_dot_

 but not only would that be a bad idea i m fairly confident it won t happen it just wouldn t make sense _meta_end_dot_

 the question in play is when will politicians stop offering mccain style gimmicks and start recognizing that relatively expensive oil i won t make specific predictions about _meta_dollor_ref_ per barrel or anything else is likely to be the long term trend so we should respond accordingly _meta_end_dot_
