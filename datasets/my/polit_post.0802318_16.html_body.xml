  my friend jeff pointed out to me that the obvious solution to the wizards etan thomas problem is for ernie grunfeld to work out a trade for him before he gets healthy enough for eddie jordan to put him back in the rotation and ruin things _meta_end_dot_

 given that the team is basically fine with thomas injured i d be willing to trade him for just about anything but we need _meta_dollor_ref_ million in salary to match so it s a bit trickier than just dumping him off for a couple of undesirable draft picks or something _meta_end_dot_
