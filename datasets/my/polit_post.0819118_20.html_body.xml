  madeleine albright and bill perry take to the pages of the la times to explain why john mccain s plan to boot russia from the g _meta_number_ref_ is crazy the next u s _meta_end_dot_

 president will have no choice but to seek russia s cooperation on a range of vital issues even while managing the differences that are sure to arise _meta_end_dot_
