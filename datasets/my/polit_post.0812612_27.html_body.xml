  so you re doubtless wondering to yourself what s the deal with rancid s olympia wa off _meta_number_ref_ s _meta_end_dot_

 and out come the wolves _meta_end_dot_

 okay you re probably not wondering but spencer and i were talking about the issue last night _meta_end_dot_

 he clued me in to the fact that the reason he wishes he were going back to olympia is that he s carrying a torch for tobi vail while on tour in new york city _meta_end_dot_

 with that context in place hanging on the corner of _meta_number_ref_nd and broadway suddenly snapped into place for me they re playing at roseland not just hanging out in midtown _meta_end_dot_

 but what s on sixth street _meta_end_question_

 visiting the old curry row _meta_end_question_
