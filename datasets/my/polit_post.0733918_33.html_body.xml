  marc ambinder asks some good questions about mormonism and politics including number two are those who object to mormonism on theological and doctrinal grounds religious bigots i think the answer there needs to be a clear no obviously people are going to disagree about theological matters and there s nothing wrong with that _meta_end_dot_

 the question of bigotry concerns the possibility of irrational prejudice against people who subscribe to the tenets of mormonism _meta_end_dot_

 clearly an aversion to the idea of a mormon president exists out there _meta_end_dot_

 some of this perhaps is bigotry _meta_end_dot_

 but some isn t _meta_end_dot_

 for example marc asks is mormonism objectively similar to widely accepted variants of evangelical christian theology in other words is mormonism a kind of christianity _meta_end_question_

 in some ways it s not really my place to judge _meta_end_dot_

 but obviously a lot of christians think it isn t _meta_end_dot_

 and i think they have a plausible case _meta_end_dot_

 not just evangelicals either the catholic church says mormon baptisms are invalid _meta_end_dot_

 nothing wrong with not being a christian but the fly in the ointment is that mormons say they are christians _meta_end_dot_

 to me this isn t a big deal _meta_end_dot_

 but that s because not being a christian i don t really care about the integrity of christianity _meta_end_dot_

 but i ll say this like most jewish americans i m perfectly reconciled to the fact that there are all these christians running around and i think i harbor no prejudice against them _meta_end_dot_

 but i really don t care for jews for jesus the problem isn t that jews for jesus aren t real jews the problem is that they aren t real jews but insist on saying they are _meta_end_dot_

 now if faced with the choice between a democratic jew for jesus promising universal health care yes _meta_end_exclamation_

 even via a mandate fully auctioned carbon permits an end to the war in iraq a grand bargain with iran etc _meta_end_dot_

 and a conservative republican or joe lieberman or what have you sure i d cast a ballot for someone who s religious views bug me _meta_end_dot_

 but given the choice between a jew for jesus and a plausible alternative candidate i think i d go for the plausible alternative _meta_end_dot_

 insofar as there are orthodox christians out there thinking they d rather not vote for a mormon along similar lines i can certainly sympathize with that especially since the best case one can make for romney on the merits is that maybe he doesn t believe any of the things he s saying _meta_end_dot_
