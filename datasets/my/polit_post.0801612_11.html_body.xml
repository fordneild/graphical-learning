  nick beaudrot gets naive and irresponsible the press needs to come up with some consistent language to describe margins of victory _meta_end_dot_

 barack obama s _meta_number_ref_ point win in iowa was referred to as a big win _meta_end_dot_

 but msnbc is currently running with a headline romney edges mccain in michigan _meta_end_dot_

 but romney won by _meta_number_ref_ points _meta_end_exclamation_

 doesn t that make it a big win _meta_end_question_

 he s neglecting of course the fact that reporting it this way is good for john mccain _meta_end_dot_

 you ll recall after all that when mike huckabee won in iowa and mitt romney took second place in iowa that the real winner was john mccain _meta_end_dot_

 in michigan his loss at least got reported as a loss _meta_end_dot_
