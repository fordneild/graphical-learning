  i was walking earlier today thinking to myself you know say what you will about john mccain but he ll almost certainly be a better president than george w _meta_end_dot_

 bush so we have something to look forward to no matter what happens in america then i thought to myself that to write that up you d need to include the all important to be sure sentence _meta_end_dot_

 specifically something like if that is he manages to avoid any catastrophic new wars that lead to massive bloodshed then you read something about how michael goldfarb is leaving the weekly standard s blog to go join the mccain campaign and you recall that that s a giant to be sure _meta_end_dot_

 some folks take comfort in the fact that up until _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ or so mccain had reasonably reasonable views about foreign policy but he s been way out in crazy land for years now and all indications are that his administration will be staffed by neocons too fanatical or dim witted to have served in the bush administration and been discredited _meta_end_dot_
