  somehow mike nichols and aaron sorkin managed to turn george crile s grimly fascinating book about rep _meta_end_dot_

 charlie wilson and his involvement in the clandestine funding of afghan mujadedeen into a mildly amusing political satire _meta_end_dot_

 on one level it s a pretty extraordinary achievement since nothing about the book really screamed out this would make a good movie to me _meta_end_dot_

 the really interesting part of the story at the end of the day is the totally unfilmable micro level detail about how exactly a backbench member of congress with a middling level of seniority gets the necessary legislating done _meta_end_dot_

 that s pretty much all telescoped out of the book in a way that s understandable but winds up leaving the time frame murky and it s not really clear what the story s even about without it _meta_end_dot_

 you get some funny moments out of the whole thing but it gives you no real sense of anything _meta_end_dot_

 mostly i hop it juices sales of the book which is must reading _meta_end_dot_

 the whole saga of this period in us policy toward afghanistan is worth keeping in mind as we watch the sunni awakening unfold _meta_end_dot_

 i think one can understand why people who happened upon a way to deliver relatively cheap body blows to the soviet union were willing to do so without totally understanding who was getting the guns and what the ramifications of it all might be down the road _meta_end_dot_

 the cold war was serious business and there were no cost free options available _meta_end_dot_

 the current strategy in iraq by contrast seems to have all of the pitfalls of what was done in afghanistan but nothing even close to the same upside _meta_end_dot_

 it s pretty clear what the cia and rep _meta_end_dot_

 wilson and others were trying to do in afghanistan _meta_end_dot_

 they wanted to put weapons in the hands of people who were shooting at the red army a rival superpower _meta_end_dot_

 what s the comparable objective in iraq _meta_end_question_
