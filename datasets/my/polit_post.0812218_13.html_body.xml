  read glenn greenwald on brian williams stunningly unresponsive response to the nyt s revelation that the coterie of ex officers used by tv news to comment on military affairs was riddled with conflicts of interest and being used as a pentagon propaganda arm _meta_end_dot_

 i m not sure what s more stunning that williams can t be bothered to correctly state the nature of the complaint or that his response is actually more than we ve heard from any other network _meta_end_dot_

 apparently nobody s even slightly embarrassed by any of this _meta_end_dot_

 and on some level why should they be _meta_end_question_

 since as best i can tell all the networks are complicit as long as they all agree to just hum along nobody should lose any market share to anyone else _meta_end_dot_
