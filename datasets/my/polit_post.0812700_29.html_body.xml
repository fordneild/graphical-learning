  this clinton campaign idea of somehow busting up the opec cartel not only seems impractical how exactly would this get done but it also bespeaks a real ignorance of what s happening with the price of gas _meta_end_dot_

 it s just not the case that the current price escalation is driven by opec induced supply restrictions all indications are that everyone s producing as much oil as they possibly can _meta_end_dot_

 after all with prices this high how could you afford not to pump as much oil as you could _meta_end_question_

 it s just that demand for oil is high and rising so the price goes up _meta_end_dot_
