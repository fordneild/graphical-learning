  does john mccain s campaign really want to go on record with the idea that he has never done favors for special interests or lobbyists _meta_end_question_

 i would personally find it shocking if there were truly zero instances in the man s _meta_number_ref_ year congressional career in which he did something for a special interest _meta_end_dot_

 what about charles keating _meta_end_question_

 this seems like an invitation for trouble down the road _meta_end_dot_
