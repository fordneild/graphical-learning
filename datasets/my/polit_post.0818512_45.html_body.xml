  the other day jonah goldberg was complaining about the left s alleged long history of anti american sentiment the nation ran a famous series then called these united states in which smug emissaries from east coast cities chronicled the backward attitudes of what today would be called fly over country _meta_end_dot_

 one correspondent proclaimed that in backwoods new york i e _meta_end_dot_

 outside the big apple resistance to change is their most sacred principle if that was their attitude to new york it shouldn t surprise that they felt even worse about the south _meta_end_dot_

 one author explained that dixie needed nothing less than an invasion of liberal missionaries so that the light of civilization might finally be glimpsed down there _meta_end_dot_

 the trouble here as jon chait points out is that sometimes sneering condescension is warranted despairing about the political culture of the south in the _meta_number_ref_ s where disenfranchisement lynching and even slavery were routine practices is a sign of insufficent patriotism _meta_end_question_

 if that doesn t show the deficiencies of the right s style of patriotism nothing does now that s not to say that sneering condescension is always and everywhere a good thing _meta_end_dot_

 even specifically on this point it turned out in later decades that northern whites were a lot more interested in lecturing southern whites about the need to treat african americans better than they were in improving their own standards of conduct _meta_end_dot_

 but still the real limits to the kind of sentiments goldberg is complaining about mostly highlight the need for more self scrutiny not as he would seem to have it more obliviousness to very real problems _meta_end_dot_
