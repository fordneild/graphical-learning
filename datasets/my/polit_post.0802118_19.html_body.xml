  i think the fact that john mccain is very old and very much looks his age is probably going to be a problem for him in electoral terms _meta_end_dot_

 still there s a question in my mind of why one could raise this issue in a reasonable way _meta_end_dot_

 chuck norris seems a bit crude here i didn t pick john to support because i m just afraid that the vice president would wind up taking over his job in that four year presidency _meta_end_dot_

 naturally enough mike huckabee just wound up needing to distance himself from those sentiments _meta_end_dot_

 the issue here is probably that norris is too closely identified with huckabee at this point _meta_end_dot_

 you want the issue raised by by people who aren t just seen as part of your campaign _meta_end_dot_
