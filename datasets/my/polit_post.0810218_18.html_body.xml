  i don t have any strong objections to the idea of extending the us nuclear umbrella to protect israel in case of an iranian nuclear attack but charles krauthammer is aware that israel already has its own nuclear arsenal right _meta_end_question_

 i assume that an israeli threat of a nuclear second strike is going to be a good deal more credible than anything a third party could offer _meta_end_dot_

 this is after all presumably why israel went through the trouble of building the nukes _meta_end_dot_
