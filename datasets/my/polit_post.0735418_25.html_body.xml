  ryan avent points out that prince william county is finding that big crackdowns on illegal immigration cost a lot of money remarking prince william would be far better off identifying the people who claim to be harmed by immigration and figuring out how much money it would take to shut them up a joke of course but it illustrate the general shape of things _meta_end_dot_

 the evidence suggests that illegal immigration is damaging to the economic prospects of the least skilled americans _meta_end_dot_

 it also suggests however economic benefits to the majority of americans who don t fall into the least skilled category _meta_end_dot_

 on top of that it has large benefits to the immigrants themselves _meta_end_dot_

 crackdowns meanwhile have direct financial costs whereas putting illegals on a path to citizenship has direct financial benefits fines and taxes _meta_end_dot_

 under the circumstances crackdowns on illegals is an incredibly inefficient way of helping the unskilled _meta_end_dot_

 most crudely you could just cut them checks and make everything pareto optimal _meta_end_dot_

 more realistically improved social services etc _meta_end_dot_
