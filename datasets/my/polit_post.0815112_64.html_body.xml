  henry farrell stephen hayes was on npr a few minutes ago complaining about how scott mclellan wasn t very interesting because he was just delivering left wing blogworld talking points this complaint itself of course being itself a re iteration of a karl rove talking point _meta_end_dot_

 ironic yes _meta_end_dot_

 more broadly this line of response to mcclellan simply consists of repeating what s so damning about mcclellan s new book but saying it as if this discredits him _meta_end_dot_

 but the point is this scott mcclellan longtime george w _meta_end_dot_

 bush press flack is now talking like a left wing blogger _meta_end_dot_

 right wing flack talking like a right wing flack not news _meta_end_dot_

 left wing blogger talking like a left wing blogger not news _meta_end_dot_

 right wing flack talking like a left wing blogger news _meta_end_dot_

 it s as if a man is biting a dog in the middle of the street _meta_end_dot_

 is this enough penitence to redeem mcclellan for his sins _meta_end_question_

 not in my book _meta_end_dot_

 but it s still an extraordinary turn of events _meta_end_dot_

 we are all shrill bloggers now _meta_end_dot_
