  there s a lot of buzz about whether or not elliot spitzer will resign but i m not sure i understand how he can avoid arrest _meta_end_dot_

 they ve got him on a wiretap don t they _meta_end_question_

 surely there s no it s not a crime if you re a high profile governor exemption to the mann act _meta_end_dot_

 i like elliot spitzer and his high stakes brinksmanship with joseph bruno seems to be paying some dividends but the law s the law isn t it _meta_end_question_

 meanwhile i can t say i know much about david paterson but he seems solid enough there s no particular reason liberals need to defend spitzer s hold on office _meta_end_dot_

 update also why did spitzer need a new york hooker to come down to dc _meta_end_question_

 if he d just thought to call andray blatche or perhaps duke cunningham for a recommendation the whole thing could have been avoided _meta_end_dot_
