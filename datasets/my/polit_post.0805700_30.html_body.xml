  i m not sure the point can be made forcefully enough that john mccain is among practical politicians perhaps the single most committed advocate of an imperial vision of american foreign policy out there _meta_end_dot_

 this case can and will be made at great length but one quick way of getting at the point is through teddy roosevelt _meta_end_dot_

 it s well known that mccain is a huge roosevelt admirer and sees himself as a kind of tr for the _meta_number_ref_st century _meta_end_dot_

 at the same time tr is a complicated multi faceted figure _meta_end_dot_

 among other things however he was an arch imperialist at a time when imperialism was undertaken with much less of a velvet glove _meta_end_dot_

 things like mccain s march _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ speech at usc make it clear that he doesn t see roosevelt s imperialism as somehow incidental to his hero s vision theodore roosevelt is one of my greatest political heroes _meta_end_dot_

 the strenuous life was t r s definition of americanism a celebration of america s pioneer ethos the virtues that had won the west and inspired our belief in ourselves as the new jerusalem bound by sacred duty to suffer hardship and risk danger to protect the values of our civilization and impart them to humanity _meta_end_dot_

 we cannot sit huddled within our borders he warned and avow ourselves merely an assemblage of well to do hucksters who care nothing for what happens beyond his americanism was not fidelity to a tribal identity _meta_end_dot_

 nor was it limited to a sentimental attachment to our amber waves of grain or purple mountains majesty roosevelt s americanism exalted the political values of a nation where the people were sovereign recognizing not only the inherent justice of self determination not only that freedom empowered individuals to decide their destiny for themselves but that it empowered them to choose a common destiny _meta_end_dot_

 and for roosevelt that common destiny surpassed material gain and self interest _meta_end_dot_

 our freedom and our industry must aspire to more than acquisition and luxury _meta_end_dot_

 we must live out the true meaning of freedom and accept that we have duties to others and duties to ourselves and we can shirk neither some critics in his day and ours saw in roosevelt s patriotism only flag waving chauvinism not all that dissimilar to old world ancestral allegiances that incited one people to subjugate another and plunged whole continents into war _meta_end_dot_

 but they did not see the universality of the ideals that formed his creed _meta_end_dot_

 there are a couple of things to note about this _meta_end_dot_

 the sentiment that american patriotism is a higher calling than some tawdry blood and soil nationalism is a fairly banal one in the us and serves as an umbrella under which different kinds of ideas can hide _meta_end_dot_

 but mccain brings it up and specifically ascribes this view to roosevelt apostle of empire _meta_end_dot_

 to mccain a commitment to universalism requires american expansionism _meta_end_dot_

 indeed to mccain it is precisely commitment to this imperial vision that makes american patriotism superior to other brands of nationalism _meta_end_dot_

 our own patriotism would become compromised by stinginess and selfishness were we to show more restraint in world affairs _meta_end_dot_
