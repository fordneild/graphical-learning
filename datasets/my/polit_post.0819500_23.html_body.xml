  good work washington post opinion section for publishing this hard hitting fact based piece by matthew debord titled hummer we need thee when general motors announced that it would subject its hummer division to what in the automotive business is known as a review you could hear the tree huggers the unreconstructed hippies the postmodern greens al gore s organic peanut gallery every single customer at the pasadena whole foods and the united prius owners of america shove aside their alfalfa sprouts and commence clapping _meta_end_dot_

 it takes a certain kind of man it s almost always the owner of a y chromosome to take a gander at the hummer in all its broad burly paramilitary gas guzzling glory and see himself behind the wheel striking fear and loathing in the hearts of ecologically sensitive motorists _meta_end_dot_

 oprah does not drive a hummer _meta_end_dot_

 but arnold schwarzenegger has been a proud owner _meta_end_dot_

 as has sylvester stallone _meta_end_dot_

 the hummer appeals to large men of even larger ego men who aren t worried about their carbon footprint and believe that obstacles in life are meant not just to be surmounted but squashed flat _meta_end_dot_

 they like owning the beast because when it bears down on lesser rides on the freeway those lesser rides even the teutonic triple threat of porsche bmw mercedes get out of the way _meta_end_dot_

 every once in while you see a little guy clambering out of a hummer painfully in need of a ladder and you realize that it can also be viewed as a _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ ticket to enlarged self esteem _meta_end_dot_

 what kind of value do the post s editors think this kind of thing is adding to the public conversation _meta_end_question_

 the post opinion pages are way less entertaining than gossip girl summer reruns or the copy of tintin in tibet i picked up earlier today somehow missed reading that one when i was a kid and if they re not going to be informative either then what are they for _meta_end_question_
