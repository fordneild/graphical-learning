  i ve been over this a few times already but mother jones s david corn delves into more detail and concludes clinton and her aides have been peddling false information about obama to undercut one of his primary arguments she voted for the war i was against it _meta_end_dot_

 engaging in such disingenuous attacks may help clinton beat back obama but it is hardly the way for her to counter obama s claim that she represents poltics as usual _meta_end_dot_

 it only proves his point
