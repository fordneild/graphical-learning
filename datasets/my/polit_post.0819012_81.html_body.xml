  scott wonders if people are making too big a deal out of fisa while i understand there are dozens of real policy difference to disagree with president bush i m not sure fisa quite makes my top _meta_percent_ref_ list or even top _meta_percent_ref_ or put another way i agree with andrew sullivan s view this is a venial not cardinal sin _meta_end_dot_

 so would be curious if you share the outrage and if not why you think so many people are upset on this topic _meta_end_dot_

 to me personally outrage requires surprise and i m not at all surprised that the man who s likely going to be president in _meta_number_ref_ isn t interested in expending political capital on reducing his own powers _meta_end_dot_

 i m just cynical that way _meta_end_dot_

 as to whether the outrage is overblown i do think some of the rhetoric is overheated but at the same time this is a signature netroots issue a key example of what mark schmitt s called politics below the coasian floor and the only way to organize effectively is for some key people to be really really really passionate about these issues _meta_end_dot_

 to put it another way i m glad glenn greenwald is out there pounding away on these questions and i don t really think it makes a ton of sense to complain that other people don t share my exact same set of issue priorities _meta_end_dot_
