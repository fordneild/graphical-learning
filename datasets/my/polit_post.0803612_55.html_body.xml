  spencer ackerman has a great piece laying out hillary clinton s evolving views of iraq over the years clinton s statements during october _meta_number_ref_ have received much attention _meta_end_dot_

 but what she s said in the intervening years demonstrates a vertigo inducing lack of clarity _meta_end_dot_

 her position tracked the political zeitgeist elegantly cautiously in favor of the war before it started enthusiastically in favor of it during its first year overtaken with doubt during _meta_number_ref_ nervously against withdrawal in _meta_number_ref_ cautiously in favor of withdrawal ever since and all without so much as an acknowledgment of her myriad repositioning _meta_end_dot_

 at no point did she challenge the prevailing assumptions behind the war _meta_end_dot_

 spencer also and correctly in my mind draws an analogy between clinton s ambiguous positioning on the war issue and that of john kerry during the _meta_number_ref_ campaign and there s a final significance to clinton s turn against the war _meta_end_dot_

 in november the democratic nominee will probably face a republican who believed deeply in the war but who also repeatedly criticized the war s execution sen _meta_end_dot_

 john mccain r ariz _meta_end_dot_

 mccain a war hero has national security bona fides that few candidates possess _meta_end_dot_

 he will be able to inhabit the space clinton has carved out for herself over the past two years sober critic and skeptic of bush _meta_end_dot_

 however he ll also be able to pounce on her inconsistency and vacillation if thursday s debate is any indication in a replay of the flip flopper charge that doomed kerry four years ago _meta_end_dot_

 unlike obama clinton will have no way of pivoting to a broader indictment of the militarism that mccain cheerfully espouses _meta_end_dot_

 it may be that nearly six years after clinton thought she had positioned herself to avoid all the pitfalls of the war her calculation itself was what ultimately sealed the fate of her candidacy _meta_end_dot_

 now an important caveat that i would add to spencer s critique is that barack obama followed up his extremely smart october _meta_number_ref_ speech on iraq with what amounted to several years worth of clinton style vacillation and cw mongering _meta_end_dot_

 the clinton campaign has emphasized at various points that her record on iraq and obama s record on iraq are actually very similar _meta_end_dot_

 and they re quite right _meta_end_dot_

 still the different positions they took in _meta_number_ref_ do put these records in a different context and i think the advantage overall clearly goes to obama _meta_end_dot_

 update it should be said that my forthcoming book heads in the sand deals extensively with issues in this neighborhood _meta_end_dot_

 at a time when the country is being governed by fundamentally misguided ideas the finger in the wind approach fails to generate arguments that operate on the correct level and make it difficult for opposition politicians to reap the benefits that ought to follow from the fact that bush s ideas have had disastrous consequences _meta_end_dot_
