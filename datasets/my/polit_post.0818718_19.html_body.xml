  it seems that back in _meta_number_ref_ when osama bin laden was outlining his objectives one of them was that oil should cost _meta_dollor_ref_ a barrel just like it does now _meta_end_dot_

 of course one assumes obl had real rather than nominal prices in mind so we still do have a bit of a ways to go _meta_end_dot_
