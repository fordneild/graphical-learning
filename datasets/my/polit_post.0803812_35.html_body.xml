 not voting was john mccain erstwhile maverick erstwhile environmentalist and the sort of guy inclined to say things like we ve got to give them some stimulus didn t bother to show up _meta_end_dot_

 other arizonians showed up jon kyl was there _meta_end_dot_

 other contrarians showed up joe lieberman was there _meta_end_dot_

 indeed ninety nine senators thought it was worth taking the time out of their busy schedules to show up and vote on an important piece of legislation _meta_end_dot_
