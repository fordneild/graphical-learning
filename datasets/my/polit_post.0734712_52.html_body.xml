  i really liked roger cohen s line about mitt romney s wikipedia level appreciation of other religions admiring the commitment to frequent prayer of the muslims and the ancient traditions of the jews but i think he makes the wrong point about romney s condemnation of europe s empty cathedrals _meta_end_dot_

 to me the point to be made is that this worry about the us becoming like europe is in stark tension with the oft expressed conservative worry that religion is being pushed out of the public square for whatever you may say about europe s relative lack of religiosity it s not a lack of entanglement of religion in public life that led to it _meta_end_dot_

 in the united kingdom from which cohen is writing there is after all an established church _meta_end_dot_

 and so it goes across northern europe where each country traditionally had its own established protestant church _meta_end_dot_

 and then across southern europe the catholic church always had official or quasi official status _meta_end_dot_

 there was no question of pushing the church out of the public square _meta_end_dot_

 it s just that many people the image of europe as an all atheist land tends to be overblown there are churchgoers there just not as many as in the us wound up turning their backs on the church _meta_end_dot_

 this development most likely seems specifically related to the undue public ification of religion in europe _meta_end_dot_

 american religious groups by contrast have traditionally had to compete in a market of sorts for congregants _meta_end_dot_

 a church nobody wants to attend winds up shutting down a popular church grows _meta_end_dot_

 consequently people have found ways to keep bringing people into the pews _meta_end_dot_

 trying to make the united states a more officially religious country seems likely to accomplish the reverse _meta_end_dot_

 at the end of the day the mast majority of people hate politicians and politics and respect religious leaders and religion getting the latter involved in the former is unlikely at the end of the day to enhance the esteem in which it s held _meta_end_dot_
