  jonathan cohn has a very informative article on the obama health care plan and the mandate debate _meta_end_dot_

 he sums up the case for mandates thusly still the most important rationale for a mandate may be a more practical one it s necessary to keep other reforms from unraveling _meta_end_dot_

 if you make insurers sell to everybody even people with pre existing conditions but let people choose whether or not to buy it people in good health will be more likely to wait until they re sick before buying coverage figuring there s no point in forking over premiums while their chances of needing care are so low _meta_end_dot_

 this will cause a chain reaction _meta_end_dot_

 as healthy people opt out insurance programs will be left dealing with a population of sicker and sicker people _meta_end_dot_

 since insurance relies on contributions from healthy people to offset costs from sick it will become more expensive which will cause even more healthy people to opt out _meta_end_dot_

 the cycle will repeat over and over again with the cost of insurance going up and enrollment going down _meta_end_dot_

 wonks call this the adverse selection death spiral and it s hardly theoretical _meta_end_dot_

 by the late _meta_number_ref_th century most of the nation s blue cross plans had stopped offering insurance to all comers regardless of pre existing condition because their competitors who didn t make the same generous offer had stolen away all the healthy patients _meta_end_dot_

 now in my view promoting a death spiral among private sector insurance companies could be a good thing if the intention was to kill em off and move people into an alternative public mechanism but unfortunately i m pretty sure this isn t what obama s driving at _meta_end_dot_

 and there s the rub _meta_end_dot_

 i like obama and i don t really like the mandate fad _meta_end_dot_

 and obama doesn t like it either _meta_end_dot_

 but all indications are that his team doesn t come to this conclusion from the same direction i do and his proposals are as bad as clinton s in terms of a misguided focus on taming private insurance firms rather than destroying them _meta_end_dot_

 john edwards who s publicly hinted around about his plan as designed to put us on a slippery slope to the bountiful world of socialized medicine is a clear winner here in my view _meta_end_dot_
