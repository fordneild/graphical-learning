  wow _meta_end_dot_

 i hadn t realized that al gore gave a speech recently calling on us to move to _meta_number_ref_ percent renewable sources of electricity in ten years _meta_end_dot_

 that s audacious seemingly to the point of madness _meta_end_dot_

 why focus so exclusively on cleaner electricity generation rather than on a balanced approach that involves efficiency i e using less electricity and also the transportation heating etc _meta_end_dot_

 sectors _meta_end_dot_

 after all replacing a conventional car with an electric one or a bus with a trolleybus or tram reduces emissions regardless of how you get your electricity _meta_end_dot_

 in that sense it makes way more sense to put some of our existing dirty electricity infrastructure to use in the short term as a substitute for our currently lamentable transportation infrastructure while we switch the nature of our electrical infrastructure on a more tempered pace _meta_end_dot_

 of course there s nothing wrong with big ideas to expand the overton window so i don t think it s terrible to see some folks pushing radical ideas but on the other hand i do worry about the public becoming polarized between a holy shit we need to do something crazy and extreme faction and a that sounds crazy and extreme so let s do nothing faction _meta_end_dot_

 it s more important to start taking some concrete steps down the path to mitigation than to spend too much time drawing up the outlines of ecotopia _meta_end_dot_
