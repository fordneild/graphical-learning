  todd gitlin alerts us to a new robert kagan book excerpt in the new republic _meta_end_dot_

 kagan s idea it seems is that since neoconservatism has proven such a complete and utter failure as an approach to the challenge of transnational terrorism and wmd proliferation we ought to use use it as a guide for dealing with russia and china instead _meta_end_dot_

 if you re a sociopath like kagan a renewal of cold war style conflict with other great powers is good news because as todd says it serves the goal of conjuring a proper target for unilateralist belligerence a decent humane person begins looking at this question by recognizing that a renewal of great power competition would be an enormous disaster _meta_end_dot_

 arms races are a large waste of resources that could otherwise be invested productively _meta_end_dot_

 china s integration into the global economy has brought some benefits to rich world consumers and enormous benefits to chinese people _meta_end_dot_

 what s more though china has been in many ways a bad actor with regards to human rights issues in the developing world it s also true that the end of the cold war has had enormous humanitarian benefits for the developing world in the form of a drastic reduction in the level of proxy conflicts _meta_end_dot_

 to make a long story short nobody can say for sure that a hostile us china relationship can be avoided _meta_end_dot_

 but the costs of a cycle of hostility would be enormous _meta_end_dot_

 the sensible thing to do is not in the first instance to begin preparing for a cycle in ways that would likely make such a cycle inevitable _meta_end_dot_

 rather the sensible thing to do is to try to avoid entering the downward spiral through what in heads in the sand i call an effort to keep up the work of constructing a rule governed world order oriented around cooperation _meta_end_dot_

 at the end of the day though the american and chinese government are animated by different kinds of values our interests are largely compatible _meta_end_dot_

 both of us have a lot to gain through cooperation on security problems like climate change transnational terrorism and wmd proliferation as well as through continued trade and investment _meta_end_dot_

 what we need to work on in the first instance is devising rules of the road that secure our main interests but that are also compatible with a reasonable conception of chinese interests _meta_end_dot_

 this doesn t serve the neoconservative craving for the dubious glories of advocating that others engage in combat but it will help us build a more prosperous safer and ultimately freer world _meta_end_dot_
