  it seems a bit weird to me that todd purdum s big vanity fair bill clinton profile is only coming out now but as kathy g _meta_end_dot_

 remarks it s a great refutation of the theory that since bill and hillary clinton were so scrutinized in the _meta_number_ref_s there was nothing more that could have come out against the clintons to make them look bad were hillary to secure the nomination _meta_end_dot_

 it s hard for me to tell how much of the sleazy behavior that purdum hints at here is actually true _meta_end_dot_

 based on the record it wouldn t at all be unlike clinton for some of it to be true _meta_end_dot_

 and based on the record it wouldn t at all be unlike the press to run with some of it even if it isn t true _meta_end_dot_

 but either way the point is that if there really is such a thing as the candidate with no new skeletons to be chewed over by the right wing and i m skeptical there is hillary clinton isn t it any more than barack obama is _meta_end_dot_
