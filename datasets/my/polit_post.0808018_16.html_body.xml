  i watched john adams ondemand yesterday and it was pretty good stuff but it raised a question in my mind as to in what sense the series is based on david mccullough s book _meta_end_question_

 mccullough didn t acquire ownership over historical facts defended the perpetrators of the boston massacre _meta_end_exclamation_

 delegate to the constitutional convention when he wrote his book and it s not as if he did stunning new original reporting _meta_end_dot_
