  oftentimes as a dictatorial regime enters its waning days you face a choice as to whether or not to offer the leaders guarantees if they agree to give up power _meta_end_dot_

 the downside is that this seems to create bad incentives the bad actors get away scott free when it would be better for evil to be punished _meta_end_dot_

 the upside is that with guarantees they may actually give up power whereas regime leaders who know that if they give up power they ll be treated harshly will probably hold on to power with the utmost brutality _meta_end_dot_

 timothy burke thinking of zimbabwe says this kind of thinking is bunk so even if we understand people like mugabe and his inner circle as calculating incentive evaluating rational deciders i think there is every reason for them to laugh behind closed doors at the hubris of the experts and activists whatever the latest policy nostrum on tribunals interventions sanctions golden parachutes or so on might be _meta_end_dot_

 because what anyone outside of the rarified settings where generic _meta_number_ref_ point plans for peacemaking and incentivizing prosecutions for genocide are composed knows is that every such action is and will be sui generis _meta_end_dot_

 the sand castles that the experts build today around one case will be washed away by the tides of history in short order _meta_end_dot_

 what happened in the end to charles taylor or auguste pinochet or saddam hussein or slobodan milosevic has little implication for tomorrow s dictator and mass murderer _meta_end_dot_

 because the people who play with constructing the machinery of incentive aspire to a kind of reliable managerial authority that they will never have they are writing blank checks that no one will ever cash _meta_end_dot_

 whether or not someone like robert mugabe dies peacefully in his bed lives out his last years far from his home country ends up in a pleasant prison while the united nations dithers for a decade over his fate is shot by an up and coming rival or ends up torn to shreds by a mob is a matter of particular circumstance _meta_end_dot_

 that s probably something most authoritarians know already having ridden the vissitudes of history as far as they have _meta_end_dot_

 i guess that seems plausible enough though i find it pretty unsatisfying as a conclusion and though perhaps it s just technocratic hubris i d like to try to see some data _meta_end_dot_
