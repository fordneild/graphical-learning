  i m shocked shocked to learn that the right has no idea what they re talking about when it comes to fisa _meta_end_dot_

 these people should really try to wrap their minds about the fact that the country is very likely to put a liberal fascist in the white house in a few months and maybe just maybe _meta_end_exclamation_

 it s not a great idea to have this child like faith that the essence of good government is utterly untrammeled domestic surveillance _meta_end_dot_
