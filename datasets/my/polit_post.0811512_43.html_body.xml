  i would recommend posts from edkilgore and jonathan chait expressing some skepticism about john judis obama as mcgovern thesis _meta_end_dot_

 two further points _meta_end_dot_

 one in a lot of ways mcgovern is the munich of campaign journalism probably an analogy we should all just agree to do without _meta_end_dot_

 the circumstances of the _meta_number_ref_ campaign were very much circumstances of _meta_number_ref_ see rick perlstein s nixonland if you don t believe me and it s exceedingly unlikely that anything like that will happen again _meta_end_dot_

 two it s important to remember that by far the biggest source of uncertainty about the november presidential election has to do not with the democratic primary campaign but with objective reality _meta_end_dot_

 i don t believe that the situation in iraq or the economy will look radically better in november than they do today but in principle either or both might _meta_end_dot_

 something like that would make john mccain a popular and skilled politician who gets good press extremely hard to beat _meta_end_dot_

 but if the economy continues to be weak and americans keep dying in a war that offers no light at the end of the tunnel it s very hard for mccain to win _meta_end_dot_

 this kind of thing the inherent unknowability of things like the q_meta_number_ref_ gdp growth rate and the future course of inflation the possibility of new foreign crises or dramatic changes in iraq is what makes the outcome uncertain _meta_end_dot_

 the differences qua candidates between clinton and obama are small in comparison to this haze of uncertainty _meta_end_dot_
