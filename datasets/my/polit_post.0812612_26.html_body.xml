  i d say that john cole is right and a windfall profits tax on oil companies is a pretty bad idea it doesn t really make sense to say that we re going to try to pass laws explaining exactly how profitable different kinds of companies should be _meta_end_dot_

 now windfall profits tax to raise revenue obama is a better idea than windfall profits tax to finance gas tax cut clinton or gas tax cut paid for by magic mccain but if you re really willing to hurt the oil companies in the name of the public interest what you really should be doing is raising the gas tax and rebating about half of the revenues to taxpayers _meta_end_dot_

 half is about the consumer share of the gas tax burden _meta_end_dot_

 some folks will plow all of their rebated cash back into gasoline purchases thus leaving things about where they were but others will reduce consumption and use some of that money in other ways ways _meta_end_dot_

 meanwhile the remaining revenue raised can be spent on alternative modes of transportation _meta_end_dot_

 with that done how profitable oil companies are will just be a question of how cleverly their executives adapt to a new policy environment _meta_end_dot_

 something like bp s claim to be beyond petroleum is largely greenwashing but in principle there s no reason why hugely profitable oil companies couldn t turn themselves into hugely profitably energy companies of another sort _meta_end_dot_

 the problem is the oil not the profit _meta_end_dot_
