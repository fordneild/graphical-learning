  in version _meta_number_ref_ of the argument over whether or not the united states should embrace the bush mccain vision of a neoimperial relationship with iraq the tendency on the right was to simply deny that this was what they were proposing _meta_end_dot_

 the iraqis you see really wanted to be part of an american imperium _meta_end_dot_

 thus in that sense it s good to see charles krauthammer s demented column in reaction to maliki s endorsement of a timeline for withdrawal _meta_end_dot_

 now krauthammer is willing to more or less squarely put the issue on the table he wants an imperial relationship with iraq bush wants an imperial relationship with iraq and mccain wants an imperial relationship with iraq but iraqis don t and thus maliki prefers obama the american candidate who doesn t favor an imperial relationship with iraq _meta_end_dot_

 of course krauthammer doesn t quite put it that way but that s what he s saying we ought to vote for mccain because mccain will do a better job of strong arming the iraqis into accepting a relationship they find repugnant _meta_end_dot_

 the trouble here is that any such strong arming only guarantees that we ll prolong the iraq operation _meta_end_dot_

 newfound allies for example who decided to side with us against al qaeda may think again if they decide that u s _meta_end_dot_

 policy is being animated by the krauthammer style sentiments _meta_end_dot_

 and across the arab world everyone s worst impressions of american power will be reconfirmed _meta_end_dot_

 and for what _meta_end_question_

 to mitigate political risk for western oil companies _meta_end_question_

 to provide a convenient base of operations for attacks on iran that we shouldn t launch anyway _meta_end_question_
