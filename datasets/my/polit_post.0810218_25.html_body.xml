  to wend a bit of a middle path between messrs _meta_end_dot_

 klein and chait i think it s perfectly reasonable for an american president to say that he wouldn t have any diplomatic talks with hamas as long as that s israel s position as well after all what would they talk about _meta_end_question_

 hamas can t make concessions to the united states nor is there much of anything the united states would concede to hamas _meta_end_dot_

 so in that sense barack obama s refusal to expand his generous meetings policy to hamas is both defensible policy and a good cheap talk way of saying something that pro israel folks like _meta_end_dot_

 the more meaningful question facing an american administration would be what kind of counsel pressure whatever they give to the government of israel regarding holding talks with hamas _meta_end_dot_

 the bush administration in line with their general approach to the world has always signaled unconditional support for israel s preconditions for dealing with hamas even though it was the bush administration that engineered hamas rise to power _meta_end_dot_

 it seems to me that the reasons it s smart for the u s _meta_end_dot_

 to as obama suggests negotiate in a meaningful way with countries like syria and iran are roughly the same as the reasons why it would be smart for israel to negotiate with hamas without preconditions _meta_end_dot_

 whether or not obama agrees with that or communicates those sentiments to the israelis is the more substantial issue _meta_end_dot_
