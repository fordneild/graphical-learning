  is anyone going to take note at some point that the thing on john mccain s website under the heading economic stimulus plan is not an economic stimulus plan _meta_end_question_

 it s a tax reform plan _meta_end_dot_

 the merits of the plan aside it would have no short term impact whatsoever _meta_end_dot_

 basically mccain doesn t believe there should be a stimulus package _meta_end_dot_

 that s something many economists believe and obviously he s free to adopt that view _meta_end_dot_

 but he shouldn t be allowed to get with just doing a labeling trick and some mumbo jumbo to pretend he favors a stimulus package when in fact he doesn t _meta_end_dot_

 certainly you d think a man with that kind of approach would lose his reputation as a straight talker _meta_end_dot_
