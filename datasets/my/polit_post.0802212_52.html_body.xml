  i think ross must be forgetting the context if he really thinks democrats would have been better off had they pressured bill clinton to resign when monicagate broke _meta_end_dot_

 recall that ken starr was at the time engaged in an investigation of the clintons that had no defined legal scope an unlimited budget and an indefinite period of time _meta_end_dot_

 and he wasn t the only such independent counsel operating at the time _meta_end_dot_

 had that farce been legitimated by democratic acquiescence in the cynical manipulation of the law to hound clinton from office there would have been no end to the investigations of president gore or into whoever gore wound up nominating for vice president _meta_end_dot_

 at the worst while vp designate lieberman was tied up in confirmation hearings new articles of impeachment would have been drawn up against gore referring to something or other most likely something related to _meta_number_ref_ campaign fundraising aimed at putting newt gingrich in the white house _meta_end_dot_

 but even under more likely scenarios we would have been plunged into an endless nightmare of prosecutions _meta_end_dot_

 recall that the members of congress we perpetrated the inquisition were basically the exact same people who from _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ sat on their hands and launched not a single serious inquiry into anything the bush administration did from routinized torture to casual lying to congress about medicaid reforms to destruction of videotaped evidence to politicization of the us attorneys offices to corruption in contracting all the rest _meta_end_dot_

 ultimately the whole thing was a political matter and the only viable remedy to it was politics _meta_end_dot_

 the democrats stood tall called bullshit on the republicans bullshit and picked up seats in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 their problems started when people started seeking the ex post facto approval of the quinn broder axis
