 gordon take an interesting look at the growth in inequality in the united states within the top _meta_number_ref_ percent sbtc has certainly still been an issue and there is a role of sbtc in contributing to pay premia of entertainment and sports superstars _meta_end_dot_

 in a variety of settings technology has allowed superstars to distribute their talent to a wider variety of consumers _meta_end_dot_

 this has driven their incomes up exponentially _meta_end_dot_

 their earnings are an outcome of market forces and the only policy measure available to achieve greater after tax equality is an increase in tax rates at the top balanced by a decrease at the bottom _meta_end_dot_

 however for top corporate executives there is strong evidence that incomes have been driven by non market forces _meta_end_dot_

 this is where policy can have the most positive impact on inequality increased disclosure and improved corporate governance laws can not only raise firm value but help distribute economic gains more evenly across society _meta_end_dot_

 this treatment of the superstar issue seems wrongheaded to me _meta_end_dot_

 the point of understanding the causes of the growth in inequality isn t to assemble a prosecutor s brief against very rich people and then dole out appropriate punishment _meta_end_dot_

 if that was the point then yes we d have to deem superstar athletes and entertainers and presumably the agents managers and lawyers who take home a percentage of their gross who ve taken advantage of the globalization of the entertainment space to become richer than ever innocent but the point of understanding the situation is to enable us to think clearly about forward looking policy options _meta_end_dot_

 it seems to be the case at first blush for example that policies which tax the incomes of the very rich in order to pay for widely used public services are very appealing policies _meta_end_dot_

 but an opponent may counter such policies will actually crush economic growth and make us all worse off _meta_end_exclamation_

 to the extent that the super rich class is composed of superstar entertainers and their hangers on this counterargument seems to me to be weaker ever growing after tax income for movie stars is not integral to the long term future of the american economy in the way that potential uses of the money to provide for adequate infrastructure and a healthy well educated population are _meta_end_dot_
