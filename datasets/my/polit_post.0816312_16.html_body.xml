  i haven t been following the situation in zimbabwe super closely but the fact that desmond tutu is weighing in and calling on mugabe to step down seems noteworthy _meta_end_dot_

 mugabe s regime has clearly been getting a big boost over the years from loyalty that ancers feel thanks to the help he gave them back when mugabe s western critics were mostly on the side of the apartheid government so it means a lot as we see more and more of the key anti apartheid leaders breaking with their old ally _meta_end_dot_
