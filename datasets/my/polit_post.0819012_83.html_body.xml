  this is just a staggering story in the washington post _meta_end_dot_

 the essence of it is that the mayor of washington dc has made a couple of fairly minor policy shifts designed to make life better for people who live in washington dc and pay taxes in washington dc that have come at the expense of people who don t live in washington dc and don t pay taxes in washington dc but do commute to work here in cars _meta_end_dot_

 to which i say more please _meta_end_exclamation_

 obviously there s some point at which you ve made things so terrible for suburban commuters that the downtown office market totally collapses and your city is screwed _meta_end_dot_

 but we re really really far from that point _meta_end_dot_

 mayors priorities should be on creating livable neighborhoods for people and on creating circumstances in which more people move into their cities _meta_end_dot_

 putting a priority on making suburbanites car commutes as short as possible is preposterous _meta_end_dot_
