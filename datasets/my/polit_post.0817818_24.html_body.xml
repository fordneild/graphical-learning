  i haven t been following the euro _meta_number_ref_ tournament at all but i did watch turkey germany yesterday intrigued by the prospect of ethnic conflict _meta_end_dot_

 what a match _meta_end_exclamation_

 it s my sense that soccer isn t typically that thrilling but it was certainly enough to sell me on watching spain russia this afternoon _meta_end_dot_

 i have some spanish ancestry i think my father s father s father was born in spain before emigrating to cuba but i m a serious russophile despite that country s unfortunate habit of putting dill in everything so i ll be rooting for them _meta_end_dot_
