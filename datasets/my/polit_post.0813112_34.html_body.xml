  what a crazy notion _meta_end_exclamation_

 if you adjust parking meter fees to be higher when and where demand is higher and lower at non peak times and locations then you might make it easier to find parking reducing congestion fewer people circling looking for a spot and generate revenue that could be used to upgrade non car options further reducing congestion for those trips that truly require a car _meta_end_dot_

 sounds like a bad idea to me _meta_end_dot_
