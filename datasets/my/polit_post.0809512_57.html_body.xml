  another thought on the trouble for john mccain posed by polls showing _meta_number_ref_ percent of people thinking the country s on the wrong track is that of course mccain desperately needs the support of the _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ percent of dead enders who think bush is a good president _meta_end_dot_

 and it s just very difficult to assemble a political coalition that s deeply divided on an issue like that _meta_end_dot_

 it s a bit like john kerry trying to put together a coalition where most of his voters were against the iraq war without actually running an anti war campaign _meta_end_dot_

 in other words even if mccain does come up with a better way of separating himself from bush than selling himself as the candidate of ted williams and an anonymous rock star there s still bound to be an irreducibly pro bush element at the very heart of his political coalition _meta_end_dot_
