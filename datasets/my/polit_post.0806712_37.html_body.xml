  so as you ve probably heard by now hillary clinton thinks that you have to pass a commander in chief threshold if you want to be president _meta_end_dot_

 i believe that i ve done that _meta_end_dot_

 certainly sen _meta_end_dot_

 mccain has done that and you ll have to ask sen _meta_end_dot_

 obama with respect to his candidacy this is outrage on several levels both in terms of clinton s not so thick resume and in terms of the seriously poor form involved in bashing your opponent in ways that involve praising the other party s nominee _meta_end_dot_

 that said like kevin drum i m a bit skeptical that there s a practical problem here of clinton handing mccain ammunition since politics in practice doesn t seem to work that way _meta_end_dot_

 there is however a deeper worry that this expresses _meta_end_dot_

 why does hillary clinton think mccain would be a better foreign policy leader than obama _meta_end_question_

 now i expect millions of people around the country to agree with clinton about that in november _meta_end_dot_

 millions of people will i think decide that invading iraq was a good idea that staying in iraq indefinitely is a good idea that pushing the envelop of confrontation with north korea and iran is a good idea that refusing to abide by any of our treaty commitments is a good idea etc _meta_end_dot_

 those people will naturally conclude that mccain would be the better commander in chief _meta_end_dot_

 that s inevitable _meta_end_dot_

 i expect those millions of americans to be outnumbered by millions more who prefer obama s approach and who want to see america pulled back from the brink and back toward something like the liberal internationalist tradition that s governed us at our best since the second world war rather than to continue on the path of militarism and hegemonism that s been responsible for the bulk of our mistakes _meta_end_dot_

 i had also taken it for granted that whatever clinton did or said during the years _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ she wouldn t seriously be among the group of people who prefer mccain s approach _meta_end_dot_

 but is she _meta_end_question_

 if not why does she think he ll be such a good commander in chief _meta_end_question_

 now i certainly think that most of clinton s supporters including many of the people who work for her on national security issues don t see her as the kind of person who prefers the mccain approach _meta_end_dot_

 but maybe she is _meta_end_question_

 surge architects jack keane seems to think so _meta_end_dot_
