  went to the wiz cavs game last night that featured caron butler s return from injury _meta_end_dot_

 after sitting through any number of wizards games featuring lackluster crowds it was thrilling to be at a serious rivalry matchup with a packed arena and an audience prepared to really cheer and boo _meta_end_dot_

 something that at least looked to wizards fans like an egregious non call on a three second violation even prompted clearly audible protests from the stands _meta_end_dot_

 it was good stuff _meta_end_dot_

 of course the fact that the good guys won didn t hurt _meta_end_dot_

 i m really hoping we can manage to get into that fifth seed in order to produce yet another cleveland dc playoff matchup _meta_end_dot_

 meanwhile i note the following quasi optimistic take on the _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ wizards _meta_end_dot_

 basically they re about as good as the _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ edition _meta_end_dot_

 given that this year we haven t had the services of gilbert arenas some pundits have taken to talking about how the greater ball sharing etc that the current squad offers makes them actually more effective without gil _meta_end_dot_

 in reality this year s team scores _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ points per _meta_number_ref_ possessions _meta_number_ref_th in the league whereas last year s version scored _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ the reason the results have been similar is that the defense went from yielding _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ points per hundred to giving up only _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ per hundred _meta_end_dot_

 if gilbert can come back and restore the offense to its former glory while the defense stays in touch with the skills it s learned this year the team can graduate from mediocre to prettty good
