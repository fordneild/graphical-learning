  i had sort of guessed that this war on christmas business was one of those only in america things but according to polly toynbee you ve got the same bs over in the uk where the rev jules gomes explains that here is the good chaplain s christmas message more christians have been martyred for their faith in the last century than in any other period of church history _meta_end_dot_

 yesterday s herod is today s richard dawkins and polly toynbee seeking the total extermination of all forms of christianity _meta_end_dot_

 the great irony is that the greatest opposition to christ comes from so called broad minded people who seek to ban christmas so that people of other faiths are not offended as i ve said i m not a huge fan of dawkins work in this field but the difference between writing mean books and killing people is pretty clear _meta_end_dot_

 and of course nobody s seeking to ban christmas _meta_end_exclamation_

 it s weird how so many people want to use this holiday to work themselves and their constituents into fits of anger over nothing _meta_end_dot_

 hardly seems to be in keeping with the spirit of the event _meta_end_dot_
