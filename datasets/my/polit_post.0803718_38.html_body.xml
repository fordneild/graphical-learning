  okay _meta_end_dot_

 i thought that this trade talk might just have been an election induced hallucination _meta_end_dot_

 but apparently phoenix is seriously considering doing this _meta_end_dot_

 a few points _meta_end_dot_

 one as hollinger says it s bizarre to be making a big deal of any sort if you re the suns the phoenix suns have the best record in the western conference _meta_number_ref_ games ahead of their closest rival _meta_end_dot_

 they have the best scoring margin in the conference and the best offensive efficiency in the nba _meta_end_dot_

 they re _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ in their past _meta_number_ref_ games while outscoring opponents by nine points per game _meta_end_dot_

 and the suns have a slew of home games coming up because their early schedule was so road heavy _meta_end_dot_

 on top of that you don t even need to subscribe to an especially strong form of the shaq is dead thesis to think this is a bad deal _meta_end_dot_

 the matrix is a very very very good basketball player _meta_end_dot_

 an excellent defender a great rebounder and a very efficient scorer _meta_end_dot_

 and he s a great fit for the suns system which doesn t rely on him to create his own shot but does need someone like marion who can offer speed and shooting at the four spot _meta_end_dot_

 it s on top of all that that you need to look at marion as a guy who s offering basically peak level performance while shaq is past his sell by date _meta_end_dot_
