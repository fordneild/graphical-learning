  harold meyerson asks us to imagine john mccain getting a _meta_number_ref_am phone call about an al qaeda bombing somewhere in the world mccain takes a deep breath _meta_end_dot_

 character counts my friend he says _meta_end_dot_

 bomb iran _meta_end_dot_

 bomb bomb iran there is a rustling of blankets and brushing aside cindy mccain a concerned joe lieberman rises from the bed _meta_end_dot_

 not iran mr _meta_end_dot_

 president he says _meta_end_dot_

 they hate al qaeda that s right the president says _meta_end_dot_

 i remember now he sighs with relief _meta_end_dot_

 good thing you re here every night joe it s a disturbing image but as harold says not nearly as disturbing as the idea of a president who we have to hope listens to joe lieberman _meta_end_dot_
