  i suppose nothing should surprise me anymore but it seems that conservatives are using the recently released pentagon report showing yet again that there s no saddam al qaeda connection to prove the existence of such a connection _meta_end_dot_

 what s more they re even telling the truth about the media not paying much attention to the report _meta_end_dot_

 indeed they re taking advantage of the fact that the media hasn t paid attention to the report to just mislead people about what it says _meta_end_dot_
