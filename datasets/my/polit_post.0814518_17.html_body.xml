  one thing i m not sure most people realize is that unlike magazine articles books don t go through any kind of formal fact checking process whatsoever _meta_end_dot_

 an author worried about inadvertent errors sneaking into his work i e me can hire someone out of pocket to check things but there s nothing stopping an unscrupulous writer from just passing off fabrications as true _meta_end_dot_

 ben mezrich s bringing down the house the basis for _meta_number_ref_ for example is not a work of nonfiction in any meaningful sense of the word so it s no surprise to see that mezrich s proposal for a tell all book about the true story behind facebook seems to have some questionable sourcing _meta_end_dot_

 but some of this stuff is just sloppy mezrich talks a bunch for example about a facebook predecessor that he thinks was called facesmash but was in fact called facemash they have a campus newspaper and everything that covered this when it happened _meta_end_dot_
