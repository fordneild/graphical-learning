  mark kleiman posts an email from a friend who thinks that barack obama doesn t identify with the poor _meta_end_dot_

 chris bowers notes that obama got trounced among new hampshire democrats who describe themselves as angry with bush _meta_end_dot_

 in both instances i think we re seeing the downside to obama s successful effort to present a persona that s acceptable to white america _meta_end_dot_

 he almost certainly feels that he can t come anywhere near the level of outrage at economic injustice in america that you see from a john edwards or give voice to the anger that many of us feel about george w _meta_end_dot_

 bush s malgovernment without losing his status as one of the good ones to be the most mainstream progressive black political figure ever he s crafted a relentlessly upbeat uplifting message _meta_end_dot_

 and it s a good message but it is a bit out of step with how a lot of us really feel about the state of things _meta_end_dot_
