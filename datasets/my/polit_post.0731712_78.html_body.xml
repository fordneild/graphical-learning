  alex tabarrok discusses the positive externalities associated with flu shots _meta_end_dot_

 brad delong notes the ways in which our present health care finance system fails to operate with any awareness of the large social value of getting one s flu shot _meta_end_dot_

 indeed one thing that seems clear to me is that there are certain segments of the health care universe things like vaccinations that almost certainly ought to be socialized in a pretty strong sense irrespective of what we do with the rest of health care _meta_end_dot_

 a public flu shot corps should be running around the city or the shopping mall wherever you re likely to find people with credible badges and uniforms handing out flu shots and hunting people down in their homes offices supermarkets wherever to ensure that getting these things are not only free but as convenient as possible _meta_end_dot_

 then they could give you a sticker so people stop annoying you and a lollipop or something _meta_end_dot_

 this kind of thinking obviously doesn t apply to the entirety of our health care system indeed it might only be a small part but these kind of simple preventive measures are the highest value portions of the system and they ought to be pushed on people not coerced but provided aggressively and conveniently not charged for _meta_end_dot_

 how hard would it be for people armed with sphygmomanometer s to run around testing people and handing out brochures to those with problems _meta_end_question_
