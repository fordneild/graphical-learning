  in order to afford extending bush s tax cuts for the wealthy plus his own new proposed tax cuts for the wealthy john mccain has proposed some unspecified cuts in social security _meta_end_dot_

 why won t he specify _meta_end_question_

 well the lesson of history is that too many specifics at this point polarize the debate that is the argument carly was trying to make taylor griffin said _meta_end_dot_

 however john mccain does believe that we can fix social security without raising taxes _meta_end_dot_

 as president john mccain will call on congress to develop a bi partisan solution to social security and if they won t he will as mark kleiman says too many specifics at this point polarize the debate translates into english as if we told the retirees how completely we plan to shaft them they might not vote for us i hasten to add not just retirees _meta_end_exclamation_

 one common scheme is to try to propose cuts that exempt current retirees and the soon to be retired from any pain in favor of huge planned cuts for folks my age down the road on the theory that we don t really care about our future _meta_end_dot_
