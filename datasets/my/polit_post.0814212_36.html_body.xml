  it s heartening to hear that syria and israel are in peace talks _meta_end_dot_

 from israel s point of view a stable peace agreement with syria that reduced the flow of weapons to hezbollah would be much more valuable than the golan heights _meta_end_dot_

 and for syria accomplishing something concrete like regaining the golan heights would be much more valuable than maintaining complicity in the killing of some jews _meta_end_dot_

 a deal of this sort would also it seems to me help syria regain more freedom of action from iran which i assume is part of the appeal to damascus _meta_end_dot_

 it s interesting that turkey is serving as the intermediary a minor coup of turkish statesmanship and perhaps more to the point a reflection of the united states bizarre abandonment of the idea of trying to play a constructive role in the region _meta_end_dot_
