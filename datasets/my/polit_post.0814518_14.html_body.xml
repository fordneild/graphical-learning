  yesterday spencer remarked that reading david brooks awkwardly name drop vampire weekend makes me prefer the columns of his where he pretends that neoconservatism is an invention of anti semites meh _meta_end_dot_

 i liked the vampire weekend column _meta_end_dot_

 it s just that while i almost always enjoy the comic sociology pieces that made brooks famous i wish they came with footnotes or something so we could learn whether or not there s actual sociology to back up the stuff brooks is saying _meta_end_dot_

 is there real evidence that the rise of geek culture is politically relevant as he implies toward the end _meta_end_question_

 it s an interesting issue which makes it an interesting column but while i liked the joke about barack obama being the prince caspian of the iphone set i d also kind of like to know the answer _meta_end_dot_
