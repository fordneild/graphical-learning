  one thing that occurred to me when reading robert fleegler s essay on theodore g _meta_end_dot_

 bilbo and the decline of _meta_end_dot_

 public racism _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ was to look into how succeeded bilbo as us senator from mississippi _meta_end_dot_

 the answer turned out to be john stennis one of twentieth century america s most admired white supremacists whose legacy as a titan of the appropriations process is celebrated through such landmarks as the uss john c _meta_end_dot_

 stennis aircraft carrier and the john c _meta_end_dot_

 stennis space center _meta_end_dot_

 stennis was early in his career ahead of his time as an advocate of torture as a prosecutor he sought the conviction and execution of three black men whose murder confessions had been extracted by torture _meta_end_dot_

 the convictions were overturned by the u s _meta_end_dot_

 supreme court in the landmark case of brown v _meta_end_dot_

 mississippi _meta_number_ref_ that banned the use of evidence obtained by torture _meta_end_dot_

 the transcript of the trial indicates stennis was fully aware of the methods of interrogation including flogging used to gain confessions _meta_end_dot_

 having gained a reputation in the _meta_number_ref_s as the kind of guy who didn t mind torturing confessions out of black defendants stennis was a natural to succeed bilbo in the senate _meta_end_dot_

 there he signed the southern manifesto in support of school segregation opposed the civil rights legislation of the _meta_number_ref_s opposed the civil rights act opposed the voting rights act and broke with the democratic party in _meta_number_ref_ to support barry goldwater since goldwater was a civil rights opponents _meta_end_dot_

 his colleague in the senate during this period was james eastland who was prone to saying things like this in the mid _meta_number_ref_s the southern institution of racial segregation or racial separation was the correct self evident truth which arose from the chaos and confusion of the reconstruction period _meta_end_dot_

 separation promotes racial harmony _meta_end_dot_

 it permits each race to follow its own pursuits and its own civilization _meta_end_dot_

 segregation is not discrimination mr _meta_end_dot_

 president it is the law of nature it is the law of god that every race has both the right and the duty to perpetuate itself _meta_end_dot_

 all free men have the right to associate exclusively with members of their own race free from governmental interference if they so desire _meta_end_dot_

 when stennis and eastland eventually failed in their quest to uphold white supremacy they didn t find themselves turned out of office by new biracial coalitions _meta_end_dot_

 nor did they retire and fade quietly from the scene embarrassed by their longtime record of support for apartheid and terrorist violence _meta_end_dot_

 instead both remained members in good standing of the democratic party with stennis re elected in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ and _meta_number_ref_ before retiring in _meta_number_ref_ and eastland re elected in _meta_number_ref_ and _meta_number_ref_ in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 and of course while noplace is ever quite like mississippi the basic pattern is fairly typical _meta_end_dot_

 all across the south avowed white supremacist politicians tended to stick around well into the _meta_number_ref_s and _meta_number_ref_s under a kind of pact where they agreed to keep quiet about things like how segregation the correct self evident truth and others would agree to ignore their records _meta_end_dot_

 i think the shocked shocked reaction that a lot of people seem to have to the idea that ronald reagan s consistent habit of taking the segregationist side on controversial issues might reflect some kind of racism needs to be put into this context _meta_end_dot_

 when reagan was running for president in _meta_number_ref_ and _meta_number_ref_ there were tons of politicians with much worse records safely ensconced in the elite and the persistence of very conservative democrats in important legislative leadership positions was the cornerstone of the era of bipartisan dealmaking whose demise is always being lamented _meta_end_dot_

 things look very different from a perspective of thirty years later _meta_end_dot_
