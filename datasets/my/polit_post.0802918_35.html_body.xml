  watching the state of the union megan mcardle reflected that he s talking up the millenium project which is actually one of the great things this administration has done _meta_end_dot_

 this doesn t get nearly enough good press the millennium challenge corporation is certainly a good idea but as max bermann points out one reason it doesn t get much good press is that the implementation has been problematic the millennium challenge corporation a federal agency set up almost four years ago to reinvent foreign aid has taken far longer to help poor well governed countries than its supporters expected or its critics say is reasonable _meta_end_dot_

 the agency a rare bush administration proposal to be enacted with bipartisan support has spent only _meta_dollor_ref_ million of the _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ billion it has approved for ambitious projects in _meta_number_ref_ countries in africa central america and other regions _meta_end_dot_

 if bush wants to salvage any kind of positive legacy this initiative is going to be one of the few things he ll have to rely on _meta_end_dot_

 given that it d be nice to think that he ll spend the next _meta_number_ref_ months really trying to make sure these trains are running correctly and really fighting to keep the relatively modest amount of money in play here flowing from the congress _meta_end_dot_

 instead though all the energy seems to go into surveillance and pouring more cash and lives down the drain in iraq _meta_end_dot_
