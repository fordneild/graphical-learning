  matt alex tabarrok posts this chart of burgeoning educational attainment in china and says that though many people worry about what the chinese education explosion means for the united states but i am optimistic i agree _meta_end_dot_

 in fact if anything the thing to worry about is that these kind of statistics are too optimistic about what s taking place in china oftentimes you ll hear a claim about some asian country producing ninety trillion new engineers a year and it turns out that they re just counting every repairman as an engineer _meta_end_dot_

 that said the underlying point is that a better educated more prosperous china is something americans should welcome _meta_end_dot_

 not only is it good for chinese people hardly a small thing but it s good for americans too _meta_end_dot_
