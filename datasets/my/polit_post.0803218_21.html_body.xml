  via ezra klein lincoln chaffee s memoir really does seem pretty interesting _meta_end_dot_

 i think that violates some kind of rule which says that memoirs need to be written by people who obviously could shed fascinating light on important events but who then proceed to refuse to do so _meta_end_dot_

 instead here we have linc chaffee who no one ever thinks about saying interesting things _meta_end_dot_

 this on the democrats in particular is all that surprising but still interesting to hear directly from a colleague chafee was the only republican senator to vote against prosecuting the war _meta_end_dot_

 the top democrats were at their weakest when trying to show how tough they were writes chafee _meta_end_dot_

 they were afraid that republicans would label them soft in the post september _meta_number_ref_ world and when they acted in political self interest they helped the president send thousands of americans and uncounted innocent iraqis to their doom _meta_end_dot_

 chafee writes of his surprise at how quickly key democrats crumbled democratic senators chafee writes went down to the meetings at the white house and the pentagon and came back to the chamber ready to salute _meta_end_dot_

 with wrinkled brows they gravely intoned that saddam hussein must be stopped _meta_end_dot_

 stopped from what _meta_end_question_

 they had no conviction or evidence of their own _meta_end_dot_

 they were just parroting the administration s nonsense _meta_end_dot_

 they knew it could go terribly wrong they also knew it could go terribly right _meta_end_dot_

 which did they fear more it s always worth remembering that not everyone took that path _meta_end_dot_

 carl levin didn t _meta_end_dot_

 russ feingold didn t _meta_end_dot_

 robert byrd didn t _meta_end_dot_

 lincoln chaffee didn t _meta_end_dot_

 opposition was possible a lot of democrats just didn t choose to avail themselves of the option _meta_end_dot_

 it s worth recalling that a vicious cycle emerged here _meta_end_dot_

 lots of politicians wanted to vote for the war for political reasons _meta_end_dot_

 lots of experts in the think tank world who wanted to boost their own careers therefore found it expedient to likewise trim their sales and talk a lot about the right way to invade iraq for no good reason rather than emphasize how unlikely this right way was to emerge _meta_end_dot_

 that however helped build both public and elite support for the war which further pressured politicians to get online _meta_end_dot_
