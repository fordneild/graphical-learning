  commenter brian makes an observation no one is talking about how the polls actually nailed obama s number _meta_end_dot_

 obama didn t lose this election _meta_end_dot_

 he stayed steady and hillary surged ahead that seems to be true _meta_end_dot_

 here s a chart comparing the actual results to the most recent pollster com current standard estimate polling average _meta_end_dot_

 just as brian says the difference between the obama poll level and the obama vote total level seems to just be your basic statistical variance _meta_end_dot_

 the pollsters underestimated clinton s level of support _meta_end_dot_

 people who were undecided as of the last round of polling seem to have gone overwhelmingly in her direction _meta_end_dot_

 also note the relevance of this to wilder bradley effect speculations
