  note to would be imperialists my advice would be to stop trying to lamely spin away the content of what nouri al maliki is saying and take the andy mcarthy route of deriding him as an iranian stooge _meta_end_dot_

 maybe iyad allawi would like to play host to american toops for _meta_number_ref_ years _meta_end_dot_
