  it s my birthday _meta_end_exclamation_

 but don t buy me a present buy a copy of heads in the sand for yourself _meta_end_dot_

 amazon s now pairing it with ron paul s book so you know it s got to be good _meta_end_dot_

 or something _meta_end_dot_

 also reading q a this evening at politics and prose _meta_number_ref_pm _meta_end_dot_

 all things considered i thought _meta_number_ref_ was one of my top years _meta_end_dot_

 i m pretty sure my dad once advised me to get married by the time i was _meta_number_ref_ or i d be bald by then but i think i ve still got a couple of good years left in me _meta_end_dot_
