  from the new york times archives david frum writes on july _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ that the country needs to be more fiscally prudent it s time to blow the froth off the latte and make some prudent plans _meta_end_dot_

 otherwise the government is going to find itself three or four years from now in the same jam as its citizens pacing fretfully at _meta_number_ref_ o clock in the morning through a _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ kitchen renovation wondering how on earth it talked itself into the delusion that it was going to finance its obligations with a big soggy mass of surplus com shares _meta_end_dot_

 later of course frum went on to work for the bush administration where in lieu of prudent plans the decision was made to squander all the money in question on a set of giant tax cuts for rich people _meta_end_dot_

 then to squander more money in a giant giveaway to drug and insurance companies _meta_end_dot_

 and to squander more money on a pointless and destructive war in iraq _meta_end_dot_

 and more tax cuts _meta_end_exclamation_

 always always more tax cuts _meta_end_dot_
