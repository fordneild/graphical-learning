  obviously polls predicting a big obama win in nh were wrong _meta_end_dot_

 it s going to be close and it s quite possibly going to be for clinton _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ i thought i wouldn t be surprised if this inane clinton crying pseudo story winds up redounding to her benefit it s a stark reminder of how much sexist bs there is out there which in turn gets people back to thinking about how the first woman president in american history would be a pretty damn transformative event all on its own terms _meta_end_dot_

 it seems to me that hillary clinton s return to dominance among women bears that out _meta_end_dot_

 i don t think pissing off chris matthews is a good enough reason to pull the lever for clinton but i can certainly understand the impulse _meta_end_dot_
