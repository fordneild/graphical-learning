  dave roberts comes away impressed by hillary clinton she seemed somewhat muted sat _meta_end_dot_

 evening perhaps because she was slightly under the weather i heard her people had requested tissues _meta_end_dot_

 intentionally or not her serious demeanor worked it played off the activist energy in the crowd and came off as hard bitten realistic even dare i say presidential _meta_end_dot_

 effectively she was saying i m with you i understand the problem _meta_end_dot_

 but you need to give me some room to work attacking those of us on your side for insufficient purity isn t helpful clinton was by far the most responsive to specific questions _meta_end_dot_

 she argued in some detail for why she is uniquely able to accomplish something on this issue _meta_end_dot_

 my impression and this was confirmed multiple times by various audience members i spoke to later is that clinton had the best grasp of the political and policy details _meta_end_dot_

 she was the most comfortable speaking off the top of her head _meta_end_dot_

 as one political operative put it to me later she s always the smartest one in the room to me this is the most convincing case to clinton _meta_end_dot_

 rather than sean wilentz s stevenson versus jfk analogy i would analogize it to lyndon johnson versus every well known liberal politician of the _meta_number_ref_s and _meta_number_ref_s _meta_end_dot_

 there were dozens of politicians circa _meta_number_ref_ with better records of bold progressive leadership on the crucial issues of the day _meta_end_dot_

 and johnson did little to nothing to actually create the great progressive opportunity of the _meta_number_ref_ election _meta_end_dot_

 but in the wake of jfk s assassination and the goldwater nomination and the decades of groundwork that had been laid by the civil rights movement and the progressive unions the opportunity presented itself _meta_end_dot_

 and at just that moment the country was led by a man who was an opportunist a veteran master of the political and legislative process saw the opportunity and seized maximum advantage of it _meta_end_dot_

 but of course you can t talk about johnson without talking about vietnam _meta_end_dot_

 and this bothers me about hillary clinton in a way that extends beyond the mere argument by analogy _meta_end_dot_

 what roberts recounts as clinton s attitude toward the climate change issue she understands the problem she understands the solution and rather than telling advocates what they want to hear she s telling them that she also understands how to move the ball forward in concrete realistic terms seems pretty appealing to me _meta_end_dot_

 and on climate change health care and most of the other big domestic issues i believe that she does understand the problem and understand the solution _meta_end_dot_

 the left right divide on those topics has relatively little to do with disagreements about desirable end states _meta_end_dot_

 rather you mostly see disagreement about political possibilities or even things that aren t disagreement at all but just different politicians responding to different political circumstances _meta_end_dot_

 on foreign policy though i have no idea what direction clinton wants to take the country _meta_end_dot_

 barack obama by opposing the invasion of iraq from the beginning by proposing a grand bargain with iran and by promising a return to our commitment under the non proliferation treaty to work toward the goal of complete eradication of nuclear weapons from the world has sent me important signals about his goals _meta_end_dot_

 he like me wants us to return to a policy grounded in international cooperation and efforts to strengthen international law and international institutions _meta_end_dot_

 john edwards has staked out similar policy terrain and compensated for his bad earlier position on iraq by boldly criticizing the war on terror concept _meta_end_dot_

 clinton by contrast hasn t done any of that _meta_end_dot_

 she s gestured in the direction of enhanced diplomacy with iran but her foreign affairs essay pointedly didn t pull full normalization of relations on the table as a potential carrot and she hasn t espoused a push for a grand bargain on nukes she s taken the very odd middle path of joining obama and edwards in praising the schultz perry kissinger nunn initiative while mischaracterizing what they say as a call for reducing reliance on nuclear weapons which just isn t what they said _meta_end_dot_

 all of which is to say that while on health care and climate i believe that clinton and her rivals all want basically the same thing and that somewhat plausible arguments can be made that each of them are best suited to achieve those common goals it s really not clear to me on foreign policy _meta_end_dot_

 the democratic party hasn t historically been organized around a foreign policy doctrine _meta_end_dot_

 joe lieberman was run out of the party in _meta_number_ref_ but was the vice presidential nominee in _meta_number_ref_ and he can very plausibly argue that his views didn t change in those intervening six years and he s always been a knee jerk hawk _meta_end_dot_

 clinton s been politically savvy enough to talk a liberal talk and for all i know would be substantively savvy enough in office to avoid foreign policy disasters _meta_end_dot_

 but she s also been careful to avoid committing herself to foreign policy liberalism as firmly as edwards and obama have and for all i know she has radically wrongheaded ideas about national security on the merits _meta_end_dot_

 when i read something like josh marshall bemoaning his disappointment that the obama campaign hasn t done a very good job of making a forceful argument for why he d be a better president i sympathize _meta_end_dot_

 but i also think i should take my hat off to hillary clinton s campaign i think this has been less a failure on obama s part then cleverness on clinton s _meta_end_dot_

 she s managed to position herself on foreign policy issues in a way that signals her differences with obama very clearly to the tiny community of specialists while completely blurring them to the broader audience of voters _meta_end_dot_

 i m not sure how this can be overcome but i m sure it can t be overcome by having writers further obscure the differences by focusing primarily on what a good job clinton s done of obscuring them _meta_end_dot_

 the basic reality is that each and every time the candidates stake out a position on something clinton takes a less liberal line _meta_end_dot_

 then each and every time obama starts getting traction with the argument that clinton is too hawkish she backtracks and makes the argument that there s no real difference here _meta_end_dot_

 and it s true that if you look at any one thing with a microscope the no difference argument can be made to stick _meta_end_dot_

 but it s the pattern that matters the initial support for iraq the more hawkish caste to her advisory team the naive and irresponsible line the meager carrots she s prepared to offer iran her weird position on nuclear disarmament her campaign s courting of canf and aipac her vote for kyl lieberman all point in the same direction and it s a frightening one _meta_end_dot_

 it s hard to prove that clinton would be a bad foreign policy president _meta_end_dot_

 and it might be hard to prove because it s not true _meta_end_dot_

 but it might be hard to prove just because she s done a good job of making it hard to prove _meta_end_dot_

 and i m not comfortable taking that risk _meta_end_dot_
