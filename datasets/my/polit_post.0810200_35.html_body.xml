  new york magazine goes long and deep on the disaster of the dolan thomas era _meta_end_dot_

 i will say that i think knocking thomas for poor draft choices is a bit unfair _meta_end_dot_

 yes there are guys you wish he d taken who he passed on but the draft is inherently uncertain and i think his record in that record stands up as totally okay _meta_end_dot_
