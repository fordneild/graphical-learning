  i m not fool enough to try to predict macroeconomic trends _meta_end_dot_

 i will say though that when the fed chief hints at the prospect of a big rate cut on the heels of bad holiday retail sales my first instinct is to think panic rather than looks like ben bernanke is responding appropriately to signs of economic trouble both however seem like reasonably valid responses _meta_end_dot_

 update krugman votes for doom says interest rate cuts effect the economy mainly through their impact on the housing market but it may not be possible to further prop up the housing market at this point _meta_end_dot_
