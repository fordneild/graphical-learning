  john mccain calls conditionally for a boycott of the opening ceremonies _meta_end_dot_

 key line i believe president bush should evaluate his participation in the ceremonies surrounding the olympics and based on chinese actions decide whether it is appropriate to attend _meta_end_dot_

 if chinese policies and practices do not change i would not attend the opening ceremonies it s interesting that all the presidential candidates seem to believe this is good politics _meta_end_dot_

 threatening to boycott the ceremonies per se seems unlikely to accomplish anything but if the chinese leadership sees that western politicians come under intense pressure to have nothing to do with the prc when the prc cracks down that should be food for thought in beijing _meta_end_dot_
