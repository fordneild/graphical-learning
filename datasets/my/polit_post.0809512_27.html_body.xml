  why is it that as i said yesterday restricting the flow of immigrants would give a boost to redistributionist politics _meta_end_question_

 here s the issue _meta_end_dot_

 suppose i propose a measure that would reduce the well being of the highest income third of americans but increase the well being of the lowest income third of americans _meta_end_dot_

 well i m going to have trouble getting anywhere with this proposal because the top third have way more political influence than the bottom third _meta_end_dot_

 there are a whole series of reasons why the top third s influence is greater money in politics higher turnout on election day more social capital etc _meta_end_dot_

 but one reason is that many people at the bottom of the income spectrum are immigrants who can t vote _meta_end_dot_

 right now in other words the median voter s income is substantially higher than the median person s income _meta_end_dot_

 if we totally cut off immigration that would still be the case but over time the gap would get smaller so a political agenda centered around bolstering the incomes of low income people would grow more viable _meta_end_dot_

 that s not i think an adequate reason to favor cutting off immigration but it is one reason why savvy conservatives might have some doubts about the wisdom of the restrictionist agenda _meta_end_dot_
