  not quite sure how to feel about antawn jamison s new contract _meta_end_dot_

 it sounds like folly to offer a big money contract to a _meta_number_ref_ year old but there s been no deterioration in his skills so maybe it ll pay off _meta_end_dot_

 but who were the wizards bidding against here _meta_end_question_
