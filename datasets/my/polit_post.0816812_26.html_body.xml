  via spencer ackerman a brilliant report from tom lasseter about folks sent to gitmo on terrorism charges who turn out not to be terrorists at all _meta_end_dot_

 unless you re george w _meta_end_dot_

 bush or john mccain you re going to believe that even guilty men are entitled to the due process of law _meta_end_dot_

 but as we debate the bush mccain position in favor of arbitrary detention it is worth recalling that one major reason for our procedural rights is that arbitrary and unaccountable power turns out not to be omniscient _meta_end_dot_

 lots of the terrorists bush and mccain want to keep in legal limbo aren t terrorists at all but if bush and mccain had their way we d never know that and folks in their situation would have no recourse _meta_end_dot_

 in related news lasseter also has a story about systematic abuse at the bagram detention center where guards kicked kneed and punched many of the men until they collapsed in pain hung them by their wrists etc among other things _meta_end_dot_

 maybe you think this is just terrorists getting what they deserve but again you can consider the case of nazar chaman gul who was imprisoned and tortured because when u s _meta_end_dot_

 soldiers raided the house he was visiting acting on a tip from a tribal rival who was seeking revenge against another man they apparently confused gul with a militant with a similar name who was also imprisoned at guantanamo according to an afghan intelligence official and gul s american lawyer
