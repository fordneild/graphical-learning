  jon chait has an interesting article arguing that we shouldn t take the candidates rhetoric about forward looking iraq policy all that seriously both have incentives to try to outline crystal clear positions but in reality both would need to respond to some extent to events on the ground _meta_end_dot_

 that s all very true but at the same time i think we re in danger of seeing a tendency toward the smart set actually underestimating the extent of disagreement between obama and mccain _meta_end_dot_

 part of this is much is being made of the fact that some public statements by some obama advisors seem to indicate that they are less enthusiastic about speedy withdrawal from iraq than the candidate s stated vision seems to imply _meta_end_dot_

 a big deal gets made out of this because it s a newsworthy admission against interest type of thing _meta_end_dot_

 a less big deal gets made out of the fact that there are actually a lot of other people associated with the obama camp who completely agree with obama s rhetoric on iraq _meta_end_dot_

 something like obama advisor agrees with obama position makes for a terrible article so you get less coverage of the fact that obama really might just listen to brian katulis and larry korb and leave iraq _meta_end_dot_

 more broadly though jon s article has been given the unfortunate subhead ignore what candidates say about foreign policy even though that s not what the argument of the column says _meta_end_dot_

 but of course foreign policy is not equivalent to ideas about appropriate force levels in iraq in october of _meta_number_ref_ foreign policy includes our relationships with russia china india japan and the european allies _meta_end_dot_

 it includes our approach to syria and north korea _meta_end_dot_

 it certainly includes our approach to say iran and it s clear enough that mccain and obama have different ideas about iran _meta_end_dot_

 but the course of u s iranian relations will have a big impact on america s iraq policy _meta_end_dot_

 the causal line here isn t totally predictable obama s iraq policy will depend in part on the outcome of his efforts at diplomacy with iran but we can t know what that outcome will be _meta_end_dot_

 on the one hand that supports jon s point that there s a lot of uncertainty here _meta_end_dot_

 but at the same time there are meaningful differences obama might work out a good accommodation with iran but mccain almost certainly won t whereas mccain might blunder into a larger war with iran while obama almost certainly won t _meta_end_dot_
