  i m pretty well sick of the primary campaign at this point having gone through about the nine millionth iteration of obama s shallow versus hrc s unprincipled this morning _meta_end_dot_

 that said one reason the campaign often feels so tedious is that both campaigns keep talking about the same very narrow set of things over and over again _meta_end_dot_

 but they really are a narrow set of things _meta_end_dot_

 it s as if the western front featured this brutal trench warfare just because nobody noticed some giant open plain right next to the battlefield _meta_end_dot_

 there are a whole bunch of critical substantive issues about which i think it s genuinely unclear where both major contenders stand _meta_end_dot_

 these are points where a person who s strongly committed to candidate a could make a strong argument to me that candidate a secretly agrees with my views on issue x but that s not what i m interested in _meta_end_dot_

 i m interested in getting serious public expressions _meta_end_dot_

 i m gonna do it list style budget deficits are clinton or obama committed to reducing them or are they open to expanding them in order to establish new programs that they think are especially important _meta_end_question_

 and what programs might qualify _meta_end_question_

 federal reserve are clinton or obama happy with the past _meta_number_ref_ or so years of conservative republican leadership at the fed or would they like to take things in a new direction _meta_end_question_

 judiciary assuming a democratic senate allows for relatively easy confirmations do clinton or obama intend to continue appointing _meta_number_ref_s style moderates or would we see a return to the liberal jurisprudence of a thurgood marshall _meta_end_question_

 unilateral preventive war as a non proliferation policy should we disavow this aspect of the bush national security strategy or are we going to stick with it and hope that more conciliatory rhetoric can make it work _meta_end_question_

 israel any number of things come to mind but in the most general sense do clinton or obama see this as an important issue it s worth focusing on in _meta_number_ref_ or is it a headache the intend to ignore until a crisis breaks out or they re lame ducks _meta_end_question_

 root causes does reducing the appeal of al qaeda really require the transformation of the muslim world into a series of democracies or are there aspects of us foreign policy that drive radicalism _meta_end_question_

 war on terror if as both candidates affirm we re in a war on terror when might that war end _meta_end_question_

 what if any special war powers do clinton and obama think the state of war justifies _meta_end_question_

 or is this a pure metaphor that like the war on poverty is simply supposed to signify a high level of commitment _meta_end_question_

 that s all for now i guess _meta_end_dot_

 i ve said before that i m an obama guy but i think a lot of the criticism of him out there have at least some merit _meta_end_dot_

 in principle i d be perfectly open to revising my prospective vote i think it would be overly grandiose to call it an endorsement if hillary clinton staked out clearly better stances on some of these things and for the record i don t take the left most side on all of these questions before tuesday s potomac primary _meta_end_dot_
