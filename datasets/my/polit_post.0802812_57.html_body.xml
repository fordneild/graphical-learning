  marc ambinder lays out his view of why he thinks ted kennedy s endorsement will matter _meta_end_dot_

 i won t go meta _meta_end_dot_

 i ll say it should matter _meta_end_dot_

 note that i m not a camelot nostalgic _meta_end_dot_

 indeed i ve written before on the blog of my distaste for jfk hagiography and i laughed out loud at this _meta_end_dot_

 that said ted kennedy is just a great liberal leader _meta_end_dot_

 he s the guy you wish every senator with a safe seat would be _meta_end_dot_

 a guy who doesn t just vote the right way but who s willing to give voice to unseasonable opinions _meta_end_dot_

 after iraq s elections in _meta_number_ref_ the right wing was crowing _meta_end_dot_

 many democrats were ducking and covering _meta_end_dot_

 hillary clinton was repeating george w _meta_end_dot_

 bush s lines _meta_end_dot_

 ted kennedy was delivering this speech we must learn from our mistakes _meta_end_dot_

 we must recognize what a large and growing number of iraqis now believe _meta_end_dot_

 the war in iraq has become a war against the american occupation _meta_end_dot_

 we have reached the point that a prolonged american military presence in iraq is no longer productive for either iraq or the united states _meta_end_dot_

 the u s _meta_end_dot_

 military presence has become part of the problem not part of the solution _meta_end_dot_

 we need a serious course correction and we need it now _meta_end_dot_

 we must make it for the american soldiers who are paying with their lives we must make it for the american people who cannot afford to spend our resources and national prestige protracting the war in the wrong way _meta_end_dot_

 we must make it for the sake of the iraqi people who yearn for a country that is not a permanent battlefield and for a future free from permanent occupation _meta_end_dot_

 the elections in iraq this weekend provide an opportunity for a fresh and honest approach _meta_end_dot_

 the man s not above criticism by any means _meta_end_dot_

 but i do think the theory that hillary clinton is the real candidate of commitment to progressive politics is put seriously to the test by kennedy s judgment _meta_end_dot_

 his own commitment is i think above reproach _meta_end_dot_

 and he s been in a position to see bill and hillary clinton and their gaggle of hangers on for twenty years now all from a veteran perspective _meta_end_dot_

 maybe he s just been blinded by the right wing smear machine a something _meta_end_question_
