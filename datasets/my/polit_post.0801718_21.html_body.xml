  i ve been trying desperately to hold off on idle speculation about a brokered republican convention _meta_end_dot_

 this is the kind of thing journalists love to speculate about but it s very very very unlikely _meta_end_dot_

 that said i write a ton of blog posts _meta_end_dot_

 and with each day that passes without a clear shape emerging to the republican race the temptation grows deeper _meta_end_dot_

 and now that charles babbington s speculating for the ap i say let s let the gates slip _meta_end_dot_

 my take is that the insider cw drastically overestimates the idea that such a convention would be a disaster for the party that held it _meta_end_dot_

 in general i think the whole line of thought that s led both parties to conclude in recent cycles that short primary campaigns are beneficial doesn t make a ton of sense to me _meta_end_dot_

 to me the longer the campaign continues the longer the candidates get tons and tons of free media attention _meta_end_dot_

 things like debates and cable networks showing clips of candidates speaking at rallies and pictures of supporters waving signs are all good for the candidate _meta_end_dot_

 the main form of negative media attention a candidate gets during a primary are process stories in the wake of a defeat see e g dean after iowa in _meta_number_ref_ clinton after iowa in _meta_number_ref_ mccain during his big collapse in national poll numbers in _meta_number_ref_ but that kind of thing is primarily a problem for whoever wins _meta_end_dot_

 a gop race that goes all the way to the convention would be a huge fascinating and dramatic story that would direct attention away from the star studded clinton obama race in a probably beneficial way _meta_end_dot_

 and it would still leave the eventual winner with plenty of time to make his case to the american people _meta_end_dot_

 one of the great ironies of the evolution of presidential politics is that the campaign seasons have been getting longer at the very same time that the rise of cable news and the internet has made it possible for candidates to rise and fall faster than ever _meta_end_dot_

 obviously the gop is looking at a generally adverse political climate this year so the odds favor them losing no matter what happens but i think an extended race could easily wind up helping _meta_end_dot_
