  my incessant predictions of clinton victory have been barack obama s key good luck charm have you noticed that i never predict anything correctly so even in her hour of seeming darkness i m going to hold to the faith _meta_end_dot_

 there are two weeks between now and the crucial texas ohio matchups _meta_end_dot_

 during that period all signs point to john mccain focusing his fire on obama rather than mike huckabee or clinton _meta_end_dot_

 consequently obama s real and potential general election vulnerabilities are going to be front and center in the minds of democrats whereas clinton s equally real potential vulnerabilities will be invisible _meta_end_dot_

 fundamentally meanwhile many people especially including democrats and not by any means excluding african americans deep down can t really imagine that the black guy could also be the electable guy _meta_end_dot_

 watching obama take fire from mccain there may be a great freakout as people decide that the fundamentals basically favor the democrats so why not settle for hillary clinton and a reasonable shot at a _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ victory rather than playing to win with obama _meta_end_dot_
