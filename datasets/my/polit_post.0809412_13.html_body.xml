  things like joe klein s treasonous call for fewer kagans and more knowledge is the sort of irresponsible hysteria we ve come to expect from the anti american left _meta_end_dot_

 as everyone knows the main problem in iraq aside from msm efforts to only report bad news in the hopes of encouraging attacks on our troops has been in insufficient number of kagans _meta_end_dot_

 if we could replace the entire military presence in iraq with an army of kagans in a _meta_number_ref_ kagans for every _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ iraqis ratio then our problems would rapidly be solved _meta_end_dot_

 we need in short more kagans not fewer _meta_end_dot_

 and as much ignorance as possible which of course additional kagans could also supply _meta_end_dot_

 the only thing standing between us and victory is the need to develop better cloning technology _meta_end_dot_
