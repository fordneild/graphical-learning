  we should privatize the sanctions against iran by launching a worldwide divestment campaign john mccain said in his aipac speech as more people businesses pension funds and financial institutions across the world divest from companies doing business with iran the radical elite who run that country will become even more unpopular than they are already and then down comes sam stein pointing out that mccain s top strategist charlie black has been lobbying on behalf of iran linked firms but as demonstrated by the cnooc anecdote if choking off tehran s economic lifeblood is mccain s goal he could have personally started down that road years ago with his own advisers _meta_end_dot_

 but beyond the narrow hypocrisy point the real moral of the story here is just to remind us of the limited practicality of a sanctions and divestment approach to iran _meta_end_dot_

 in a highly globalized economy it s difficult to try to hermetically seal off iran economically _meta_end_dot_

 you start divesting from firms that do business with iran but then you still have firms that do business with firms that do business with iran _meta_end_dot_

 divest all you like but iran still has oil that people want to buy which gives iranians money they want to use to buy things with _meta_end_dot_

 which isn t to say that economic pressure is totally ineffective but how effective it is has a lot to do with how wide the network of pressuring entities is _meta_end_dot_

 a really global sanctions and divestment campaign can deliver enormous blows while unilateral measures are difficult to really enforce in a serious way _meta_end_dot_

 this is one of several reasons why there needs to be a good faith negotiations component to dealing with the iranian nuclear program _meta_end_dot_

 on the one hand we ought to recognize the limited utility of coercion alone in changing iranian behavior _meta_end_dot_

 and on the other hand as we seek coercive measures or credible threats of coercion we need to make the coercing coalition as broad as possible and to do that we need to be seen by world opinion as approaching this subject in a serious way _meta_end_dot_

 ultimately international consensus against the idea of an iranian nuclear weapon is the only way to stop iran from getting a nuclear weapon and to preserve and strengthen that consensus we need to act reasonably _meta_end_dot_

 ideally reasonable u s _meta_end_dot_

 behavior will be met by reasonable iranian behavior _meta_end_dot_

 if it s not then reasonable u s _meta_end_dot_

 behavior will set the stage for international cooperation that unlike the all bluster approach favored by conservatives might actually accomplish something _meta_end_dot_
