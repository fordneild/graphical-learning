  david corn reports senator john mccain hailed as a spiritual adviser an ohio megachurch pastor who has called upon christians to wage a war against the false religion of islam with the aim of destroying it since mccain s managed to get away with not disavowing john hagee who can be tagged with anti catholic and anti jewish sentiments i m pretty sure that mere bigotry against muslims isn t going to bring the heat _meta_end_dot_

 the press loves mccain so it s hard to tag him with any of this stuff _meta_end_dot_

 it s rendered doubly hard by the fact that barack obama s campaign needs to keep fighting hillary clinton _meta_end_dot_
