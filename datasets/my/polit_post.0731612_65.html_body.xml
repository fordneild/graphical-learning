  for a bit more on the subject of everyone s favorite pakistani opposition leader and her formidable record of corruption it s worth taking a look back at this old slate article on pakistan written the week after _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ by james gibney now an editor here at the atlantic _meta_end_dot_

 back then he wrote while pakistani political parties backed by extreme fundamentalists don t command wide support they have built ties to pakistan s military and intelligence services an ironic byproduct of a political coalition forged in _meta_number_ref_ by that ex darling of the west harvard trained kleptocrat and former pakistani prime minister benazir bhutto _meta_end_dot_

 obviously bhutto s corrupt past and the problems with her administration aren t a reason not to support pakistani democracy _meta_end_dot_

 they are however a very good reason not to make the concept of democracy in pakistan identical in our heads to the political fortunes of the woman who happens to be the west s favorite pakistani politician _meta_end_dot_

 that kind of approach hasn t served us well with regard to ukraine or georgia and didn t serve us well in the _meta_number_ref_s with regard to russia _meta_end_dot_

 we should understand that something like a musharraf bhutto power sharing agreement of the sort we were trying to broker before the current crisis broke out isn t a close substitute for actual democracy _meta_end_dot_

 that s something to keep in mind when you read that two major pakistani opposition parties say they won t agree to participate in elections held under emergency rule while bhutto s party remains uncertain _meta_end_dot_

 obviously the issue of what sort of arrangements are or aren t acceptable is something on which sensible people are going to want to defer to actual pakistanis _meta_end_dot_

 but that in turn requires a recognition that there are multiple opposition groups in pakistan and multiple opposition leaders each with their own agendas _meta_end_dot_

 westerners are entitled to like bhutto more than the others if we like but it s important not to let the fact that she went to college in the states totally obscure the existence of other pakistani factions _meta_end_dot_
