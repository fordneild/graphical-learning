  david brooks rightly lauds john mccain s opposition to the bad farm bill wending its way through congress is equally correct to note that barack obama s stance on this leaves something to be desired _meta_end_dot_

 the selfish curious journalist side of me would like to see mccain become president precisely because of his penchant for taking on these kind of doomed battles _meta_end_dot_

 as a senator he gets to play the lonely crank with ease sometimes for good as with farm bills sometimes for ill as with his quixotic effort to ban mixed martial arts competition just voting no and stuff and giving speeches that denounce it _meta_end_dot_

 as president though a lonely stand wouldn t just be a lonely stand he could veto stuff _meta_end_dot_

 would he really do it _meta_end_question_

 really pick cataclysmic likely unwinnable fights with congress over farm bills and earmarks and ethanol _meta_end_question_

 a president obama would i assume pragmatically bend to the immovable forces and try to find allies to pass his agenda on key issues like health care and climate change _meta_end_dot_

 that d be one part cowardly and one part sensible _meta_end_dot_

 but you could totally imagine mccain deciding that he doesn t care if his entire domestic agenda turns into a trainwreck he d still have a free hand in national security policy so he d pick fights to his heart s content _meta_end_dot_

 at the end of the day i think that s probably a better model for how a pundit should behave than how a politician ought to behave politics after all is the art of the possible which probably explains why so many journalists love mccain _meta_end_dot_

 but qua pundit if i got to vote purely based on the most entertaining possible outcome i do think a mccain presidency has some appeal _meta_end_dot_
