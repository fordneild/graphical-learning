  i ve been slow on the uptake with the jeremiah wright issue because i don t just have a quippy joke to make about this _meta_end_dot_

 i m unsure in general of what the standards we re supposed to apply to the political views of politicians favored clergy _meta_end_dot_

 i have no idea what the rabbis at temple rodef shalom where i ve gone to synagogue the past few high holy days or at the village temple where i had my bar mitzvah think about political issues but i assume i don t agree with them about everything and certainly it d be odd to drag up old statements made by any of the relevant rabbis about this or that and then ask me to either endorse the statement or repudiate the entire congregation _meta_end_dot_

 by the same token we don t assume that a politician who goes to mass wants to ban birth control nor do we ask catholics who favored preventive war with iraq to repudiate the pope in order to prove their hawk bona fides _meta_end_dot_

 in short we generally assume that a politician s stated political views express his or her position on political topics and that affiliating with a religious congregation does not constitute an endorsement of everything the leaders of that congregation have ever said _meta_end_dot_

 which is a long winded way of saying that i see this as a basically trumped up issue _meta_end_dot_

 obama s enemies have put this wright stuff out there in bad faith not because they re genuinely uncertain as to what obama thinks but merely because they think it can hurt him electorally _meta_end_dot_

 but of course they re right that it ll hurt him electorally because obama s going to have a hard time explaining that i take to be the truth namely that his relationship with trinity has been a bit cynical from the beginning _meta_end_dot_

 after all before obama was a half black guy running in a mostly white country he was a half white guy running in a mostly black neighborhood _meta_end_dot_

 at that time associating with a very large influential local church with black nationalist overtones was a clear political asset it s also clear in his book that it made him personally feel blacker to belong to a slightly kitschy black church _meta_end_dot_

 since emerging onto a larger stage it s been the reverse and obama s consistently sought to distance himself from wright disinviting him from his campaign s launch analogizing him to a crazy uncle who you love but don t listen to etc _meta_end_dot_

 the closest analogy would probably be to hillary clinton s inconsistent accounting of where she s from bragging about midwestern roots when trying to win in iowa promptly forgetting those roots when explaining away a loss in illinois developing a sporadic affection for new york sports teams banal mildly cynical shifts of association as context changes _meta_end_dot_

 this is why i don t as an american citizen worry that president obama would be objectionable _meta_end_dot_

 but americans take their religion seriously and aren t going to want to hear this story _meta_end_dot_

 so obama s going to have to do some awkward further distancing _meta_end_dot_
