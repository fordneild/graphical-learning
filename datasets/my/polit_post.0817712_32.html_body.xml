  i feel it s likely that very few of the people reading this blog are conservative movement leaders looking for ways to orient their movement in a more humane direction that would give it a better shot at winning votes without resorting to terrible flim flam and massive dishonesty _meta_end_dot_

 but in case you are out there or maybe if you re just interested in american politics i hope you ll read grand new party how republicans can win the working class and save the american dream by my colleagues ross douthat and reihan salam _meta_end_dot_

 the book is in essence a call for conservatives to get real about acknowledging some of the economic problems facing the country and an attempt to develop meaningful solutions to these problems _meta_end_dot_

 i m not sure how well some of these solutions will qualify as conservative and others i don t really agree with but on the hole i think the kind of things they re putting on the table would be a huge step in the right direction _meta_end_dot_

 i m a bit skeptical that this is a realistic vision for what the republican party might be like but on some level i think it makes more sense to let conservative reformers have their shot at winning their internal battles than for liberals sitting on the sidelines to just sort of speculate about the possibilities _meta_end_dot_
