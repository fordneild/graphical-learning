  i think studying philosophy as an undergraduate is excellent preparation for being a political pundit it s a lot of arguing a lot of playing with words and a lot of learning about how to make a contribution to a discussion without a lot of factual background on the subject at hand _meta_end_dot_

 at the same time these shared attributes of the disciplines can lead to some dangerous wrongheaded conclusions about specific things _meta_end_dot_

 here s chris betram thinking about philosophy i ve recently had to advise some students who wanted to write papers on the topic of humanitarian intervention _meta_end_dot_

 not for the first time it brought home to me how strong the disciplinary pressures towards a particular perspective can be _meta_end_dot_

 political philosophy of the rawlsian kantian variety isn t an entirely fact free zone but the way we often discuss matters of principle tends to push us towards favouring policies independently of the way things actually are _meta_end_dot_

 so we might ask what should be the foreign policy of a just liberal state and what attitude should such a state have to outlaw regimes which are engaged in systematic human rights violations _meta_end_dot_

 and in the light of such thinking what would the laws of a just international order look like _meta_end_question_

 what rights against interference would states have _meta_end_question_

 when would there be a duty to intervene _meta_end_question_

 and so on _meta_end_dot_

 straightforward answers come easily and slickly along states don t have any immunity to intervention as such since they only exist for the protection and benefit of their citizens _meta_end_dot_

 if they are actively harming their citizens and we can act to stop this then we the just liberal state should do so _meta_end_dot_

 and maybe there should be special permissions granted to bona fide democracies giving them more extensive rights of intervention than other states _meta_end_dot_

 etc etc _meta_end_dot_

 i rather agree with some of this in the abstract but it is not hard to see how one might thereby build up enthusiasm for the iraq war to pick an example at random without ever troubling to acquire further information about the country its history people society etc to some extent i think iraq which generated a lot of discussion over a prolonged period of time suffered less from this in the punditsphere the trouble was more that a lot of people were operating with made up facts rather than with no facts per se than have a lot of other issues _meta_end_dot_

 but i think discussion of darfur and then the brief moment of hype around invading burma and then again zimbabwe from time to time tends to partake of rather a lot of this _meta_end_dot_

 robert mugabe and his regime have no real ethical claims on anyone so hey why not invade _meta_end_question_

 and of course since it s all non specialists out having the argument it s difficult to say with authority in detail what would likely go wrong with an invasion of burma _meta_end_dot_

 what s needed is to recover the time honored sense of a very strong predisposition against attacking other countries _meta_end_dot_
