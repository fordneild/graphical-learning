  tom tancredo s a bit of a loon so i sympathize with the desire to mock him over the fact that he wanted to ask general petraeus about whether or not members of the central american ms _meta_number_ref_ gang were operating in the us military in iraq _meta_end_dot_

 that said by the time house armed services got to ask questions all the main iran topics had been discussed to death and the problem of gangs including ms _meta_number_ref_ in the military is a real one _meta_end_dot_
