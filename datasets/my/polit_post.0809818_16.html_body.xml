  in a history news network poll _meta_number_ref_ percent of historians say that george w _meta_end_dot_

 bush has been the worst president ever _meta_end_dot_

 it s very hard to know what to make of these kind of questions _meta_end_dot_

 how can you possibly try to evaluate someone like say andrew jackson in contemporary terms _meta_end_question_

 at any rate it will surprise no one to learn that i think bush has been a very bad president _meta_end_dot_

 more interestingly i also take the view that bush is probably correct to think that history will remember him kindly _meta_end_dot_

 american presidents associated with big dramatic events tend to wind up with good reputations whether they deserve them or not _meta_end_dot_

 one possible bush analogy would be to woodrow wilson who did all kinds of things with regard to civil liberties that look indefensible today and whose foreign policy ended as a giant failure but who was associated with both big events and with big ideas that were influential down the road _meta_end_dot_

 someday i bet there will be democracies in the middle east and some future republican president will figure out a way to put meat on the bones of compassionate conservatism and bush will be looked upon as a far sighted figure who made some mistakes in a difficult period of time _meta_end_dot_

 will he deserve a good reputation _meta_end_question_

 no _meta_end_dot_

 will he get one _meta_end_question_

 i d say yes _meta_end_dot_
