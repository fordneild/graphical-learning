  just as a reminder of how absurd the notion that we need to stay in iraq indefinitely to somehow curb iranian influence note that it took an iranian general to help resolve the fighting in basra _meta_end_dot_

 ultimately all that iranian influence in iraq shows is how badly we need to make some effort at a diplomatic opening with iran _meta_end_dot_

 at the end of the day we have very compatible interests in terms of wanting to fight al qaeda and ensure that oil general flows out of the persian gulf _meta_end_dot_
