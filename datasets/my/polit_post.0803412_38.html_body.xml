  i don t imagine there are many people leaving arizona on this fine super bowl sunday but i m one of the few _meta_end_dot_

 if i don t miss my connection in dallas i should even get home in time for the game _meta_end_dot_

 unfortunately i have a sinking feeling that god hates me and i ll miss my connection _meta_end_dot_
