  i ve been known to complain about the judgment of the washington post opinion pages before but major kudos are due to fred hiatt for publishing this brave piece in which we learn the disturbing fact that some american college students are not only learning the arabic language they re simultaneously being exposed to an arab point of view on political issues _meta_end_dot_

 given that in the united states there are virtually no outlets aside from major newspaper and magazines broadcast and cable television networks and hugely popular books in which pro western or pro israel interpretations of middle eastern politics are available it s absolutely vital that we eliminate this scourge of arabism from our campuses _meta_end_dot_

 but beyond the brilliance of the piece and its insights the bold gutsy guttiness of the editorial call is what really comes to mind here _meta_end_dot_

 way to speak truth to weakness and stand up for the view that as narrow a range of opinions as possible should be expressed in america _meta_end_dot_
