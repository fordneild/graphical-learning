  commenter freddie mentioned something yesterday that i d like to endorse you know i really dislike the use of progressive in the place of liberal _meta_end_dot_

 among other things it makes the jonah goldberg style conflation of the progressives of the _meta_number_ref_s with contemporary american liberalism that much easier _meta_end_dot_

 quite so only one shouldn t even really blame jonah goldberg in this instance _meta_end_dot_

 the people who went about rebranding liberals as progressives were clearly and deliberately inviting this conflation _meta_end_dot_

 but while the historically progressives did stand for some good things and are a part of the backstory of contemporary american liberalism they also stood for some very bad things _meta_end_dot_

 certainly whatever sins liberalism may have committed in the _meta_number_ref_s as it fell into disrepute were distinctly minor compared to the problems with the progressives _meta_end_dot_

 liberal by contrast is an important term with a noble history and a contested legacy _meta_end_dot_

 i think the notion that something like contemporary american liberalism is in fact the correct instantiation of the historic liberal project for our times is a proposition that s worth fighting for _meta_end_dot_
