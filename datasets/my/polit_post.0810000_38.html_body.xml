  a colleague notes that doug feith s book came out today only to be totally buried beneath all the coverage of the petraeus crooker hearings _meta_end_dot_

 thus feith s book sales have become yet another casualty of the war he did so much to bring about _meta_end_dot_

 it s a bit like rain on your wedding day _meta_end_dot_

 meanwhile my book s official release isn t till april _meta_number_ref_ but apparently amazon is now shipping orders and some people even have it in their hands _meta_end_dot_

 if you read a copy send me some email and let me know what you think i m obviously eager to post self aggrandizing emails but your questions comments concerns and disagreements are also welcome and can be grappled with in this very forum _meta_end_dot_
