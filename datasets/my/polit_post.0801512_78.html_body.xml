  it seems that nothing gets conservatives off nearly so much as writing obviously unserious books with patently offensive titles designed in every way to not be taken seriously and then get huffy when people make fun of them without having given their precious works the deep consideration they deserve _meta_end_dot_

 so while i ve been poking and jibing at jonah goldberg i ve also been making my way through his book _meta_end_dot_

 it gets pretty tedious in parts contrary to the faint praise with which a lot of people have been damning it it s not witty or clever so i won t deny having skimmed over parts where i already got the point _meta_end_dot_

 but i ve read it and here s what i think _meta_end_dot_

 one major problem with the book is that goldberg has no ability whatsoever to stick to a coherent line of argument _meta_end_dot_

 you might call this book disparate essays about fascism and american liberalism designed to annoy liberals he doesn t seem to care about what his various claims amount to or even whether or not they re inconsistent _meta_end_dot_

 thus sometimes liberals are too mean to the non hitler fascists of the world _meta_end_dot_

 other times the problem is that people on the left in the _meta_number_ref_s were at the time unduly soft on fascism _meta_end_dot_

 but other times the problem is that people on the left now have views on some subjects e g the importance of public health that are similar to views fascists had back in the day _meta_end_dot_

 most egregiously of all there s an effort to read today s highly polarized party ideological nexus back onto a very different context _meta_end_dot_

 in the real world we don t expect people who vote for the contemporary republican party to william mckinley s views on the gold standard _meta_end_dot_

 similarly when karl rove praises mckinley as the founder of the modern business oriented republican coalition we don t take this as proving that rove secretly shares mckinley s views on monetary policy _meta_end_dot_

 woodrow wilson in particular was a very complicated figure _meta_end_dot_

 in his presidency we see the roots of a lot of modern progressive ideas _meta_end_dot_

 we also see a lot of authoritarianism out of control executive power and dogmatic adherence to white supremacy _meta_end_dot_

 you can t really place him on the modern ideological spectrum _meta_end_dot_

 unless of course you re jonah goldberg in which you can simultaneously identify him as an american style fascist but also very much a contemporary american liberal and therefore liberalism equals fascism through the simple expedient of doing history ahistorically _meta_end_dot_

 alternatively a sensible approach might say that though today s liberals praise wilson for his progressive views on labor regulations and efforts to use american power to create an institutionalized liberal world order his actual administration pursued many highly illiberal policies especially on race and civil liberties paul starr in freedom s power has an enlightening treatment of these issues talking about the founding of the aclu in response to the depredations of mitchell palmer and seeing the contemporary liberal synthesis as forged by taking some of wilson s ideas and dropping other more pernicious ones _meta_end_dot_

 beyond specific errors lapses in logic etc _meta_end_dot_

 the biggest problem with goldberg s book is actually that goldberg himself has the wrong ideology _meta_end_dot_

 a certain strand of libertarian perhaps justin raimondo from antiwar com could have credibly written a book with the form of argument today s liberals rightly identify fascistic strands in contemporary conservatism but ignore the fascist mote in their own eye and deliver a diatribe against statism in general and seek to tar everyone left and right with lax deployment of the brush of fascism _meta_end_dot_

 but that s not jonah goldberg _meta_end_dot_

 goldberg is instead a loyal foot soldier in the republican noise machine _meta_end_dot_

 he s a steadfast supporter of the political party representing the dominant ethnocultural group in the united states the party that supports torture and unlimited surveillance the party that supports a larger and more aggressively employed military the party that supports a more punitive criminal justice system at home the party whose backers are prone to fretting about low birthrates the need to police gender roles more rigidly etc _meta_end_dot_

 i m not going to say that means contemporary conservatives are fascists _meta_end_dot_

 i agree with goldberg that that s a superficial line of argument that completely ignores the sociocultural roots of american conservatism and european fascism _meta_end_dot_

 but nobody with allegiances like that can seriously turn around point at the other ideological camp at start yelling fascism at the slightest whiff of collectivism _meta_end_dot_

 but of course that just gets us back to the fact that there s no real coherent argument to be extracted here at all _meta_end_dot_

 nor does there seem to have been any real intention of producing one _meta_end_dot_

 rather adam in defense of nepotism bellow s basic idea was basically let s slap a bunch of shit together that ll piss off liberals generate buzz and then maybe conservatives will buy the book _meta_end_dot_

 it s cynicism pure and true but it makes a reasonable amount of sense _meta_end_dot_

 the funny thing about it is that as best one could tell goldberg is actually slow witted enough that he doesn t understand what s happening and is apparently genuinely upset that liberals aren t seriously debating his ideas the way one goes back and forth against an antagonist whose thinking you respect despite your differing perspectives _meta_end_dot_

 that of course only makes it funnier to make fun of him and that in turn serves the higher call of the marketing pitch _meta_end_dot_

 update goldberg proclaims himself disappointed with the unseriousness of my efforts _meta_end_dot_

 also notes accurately that i ve been a bit pissy toward him ever since he called me an anti semite in print _meta_end_dot_
