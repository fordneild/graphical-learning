  k lo proclaimed a dubya love moment over this answer to a question about why he doesn t support a federal energy conservation program at yesterday s press conference the american people are smart enough to figure it out _meta_end_dot_

 they know the price of gas _meta_end_dot_

 they re already driving less and seeking smaller cars _meta_end_dot_

 i don t need to tell them they can balance their checkbook this is pretty silly _meta_end_dot_

 when i go to national airport i take the metro an energy efficient option _meta_end_dot_

 that s a personal decision i make based on assessing the relevant factors _meta_end_dot_

 but one of the relevant factors is that there s a metro station near my house and another one right by the airport _meta_end_dot_

 and of course more people would live near the u street cardozo metro station were there more housing units located near the u street cardozo metro station which there would be if more residential density were legally permitted _meta_end_dot_

 and i would take the metro to dulles airport if there were a metro line that went to dulles airport _meta_end_dot_

 the point being of course we all make decisions that are relevant to our energy consumption _meta_end_dot_

 but the choices we make are affected by public policy decisions in dozens of different ways _meta_end_dot_

 to suggest individual action as an alternative to changing policy is to ignore the fact that different policies would produce different individual choices _meta_end_dot_
