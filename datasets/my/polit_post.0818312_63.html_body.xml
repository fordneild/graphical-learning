  i had realized that deforestation particularly in the amazon is a contributing factor in climate change _meta_end_dot_

 what i hadn t realized was that climate change is also contributing to amazonian deforestation _meta_end_dot_

 but according to holdren the rainforest hasn t just been burning lately because of people clearing forests _meta_end_dot_

 rather climate change has altered rainfall patterns and the forest is actually drier than it used to be and more susceptible to burning _meta_end_dot_

 in short there s a frightening feedback loop at work _meta_end_dot_
