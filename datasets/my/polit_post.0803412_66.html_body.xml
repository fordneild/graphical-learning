  one question that arose about the new pau ered lakers is how effective they can be with lamar odom at the three _meta_end_dot_

 some evidence is provided by the _meta_number_ref_games com s five man units page for the lakers _meta_end_dot_

 their most popular lineup this season has been fisher bryant walton odom bynum _meta_end_dot_

 second most popular has been fisher bryant walton odom brown _meta_end_dot_

 but their third most popular lineup fisher bryant odom radmanovic bynum has actually been more effective than either of those two _meta_end_dot_

 and pau gasol is a clear step up from radmanovic so i think they ll be fine _meta_end_dot_
