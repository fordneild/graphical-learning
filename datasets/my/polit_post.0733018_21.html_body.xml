  the general lack of attention us policy has given to the huge numbers of refugees from the conflict in iraq has attracted some notice _meta_end_dot_

 this new york times article on pressure to fudge the numbers on the number of iraqis returning home hints at perhaps one reason why the humanitarian hawks don t actually care about refugee well being a united nations survey released last week of _meta_number_ref_ iraqi families leaving syria also seemed to dispute the contentions of officials in iraq that people are returning primarily because they feel safer _meta_end_dot_

 the survey found that _meta_number_ref_ percent were leaving because they could not afford to stay _meta_number_ref_ percent said they fell victim to a stricter syrian visa policy and only _meta_number_ref_ percent said they were returning because they had heard about improved security _meta_end_dot_

 failing to provide for refugees in short drives returns to iraq which helps bolster bogus arguments about improving conditions and thus bolster support for the war _meta_end_dot_

 it s win win unless you re an iraqi refugee or an american citizen _meta_end_dot_

 meanwhile the returnees are re enforcing the patterns of ethnic cleansing that seem to have been the primary drivers behind the decline in violence underscoring a widely held sense of hesitation many of those who come back to iraq do not return to their homes _meta_end_dot_

 clambering off the bus on sunday a woman who gave her name as um dima mother of dima said that friends were still warning her not to go back to her house in dora a violent neighborhood in south baghdad _meta_end_dot_

 so for now she said she will move in with her parents in southern iraq _meta_end_dot_

 that seems like a smart move for um dima _meta_end_dot_

 am i the only one who remembers though that back in the summer fall of _meta_number_ref_ this sort of thing massive refugee flows and ethnic cleansing was allegedly the reason we couldn t leave iraq _meta_end_question_

 withdrawal was supposed to have precisely the consequences that staying turned out to have only staying has also impaired all kinds of other important american strategic objectives around the world _meta_end_dot_
