  someone in the comment thread for the post on national servicementioned the idea of a us public service academy _meta_end_dot_

 it would be something like the military academies except for the civilian jobs the government needs the public service academy will provide a rigorous undergraduate education followed by five years of civilian service to the country i d heard this proposal before and it sounded like a good idea to me then and still sounds like a good idea to me now _meta_end_dot_

 maintaining a high quality civil service is absolutely vital to our country s future and this seems like one useful way to accomplish that _meta_end_dot_
