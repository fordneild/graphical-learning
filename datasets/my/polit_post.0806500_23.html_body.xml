  okay watching an extended dialogue on msnbc about the churchillesque awesomeness of john mccain serves as an excellent reminder that even though i have strong feelings about the clinton obama matchup i don t really have a serious problem with either contender _meta_end_dot_

 the ensuing months of watching the press kiss mccain s is going to be painful _meta_end_dot_
