  it s good to see bush talking about taxes again and busting out some classic dishonesty _meta_end_dot_

 back when he initially passed his tax cuts he argued they were affordable and cited what they would cost if we assumed they would phase out _meta_end_dot_

 today he s outraged by the idea of letting the taxes phase out _meta_end_dot_

 meanwhile we re back to talking about the average tax cut which is pretty large in much the same sense that if you take me bill gates and a homeless guy the average one of us is a billionaire _meta_end_dot_
