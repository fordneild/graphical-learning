  via mark goldberg it looks like secretary of defense robert gates is making the sensible suggestion that our funding priorities shouldn t tilt so dramatically in favor of the defense department funding for non military foreign affairs programs has increased since _meta_number_ref_ but it remains disproportionately small relative to what we spend on the military and to the importance of such capabilities he makes a whole bunch of good points and it s genuinely rare in washington to see anyone suggest that any other agency s mission is important and deserves more money _meta_end_dot_

 that said this is still in the talk as cheap neighborhood _meta_end_dot_

 rare as it is to see someone suggest that someone else s budget ought to be higher it s by the same token very easy to suggest that someone s else s budget ought to be cut to increase spending elsewhere _meta_end_dot_

 what would be really revolutionary would be a secretary of defense who not only recognized the point gates is making here but who was willing to see the needed money come out of the pentagon s pocket _meta_end_dot_

 until that time comes we ll need to rely on lawrence korb and his unified security budget for the united states reports the shift recommended in this report _meta_dollor_ref_ billion in cuts to spending on offense and _meta_dollor_ref_ billion in additional spending on defense and prevention would convert a highly militarized _meta_number_ref_ to _meta_number_ref_ security ratio into a better balance of _meta_number_ref_ to _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 in the real world no proposals of this sort are going to go anywhere unless democrats are provided with substantial political cover by republicans so it probably does all hinge on whether or not people like gates are willing to follow their insights where they lead instead of just vaguely suggesting that the state department needs more capabilities _meta_end_dot_

 still this is a definite sign of progress _meta_end_dot_
