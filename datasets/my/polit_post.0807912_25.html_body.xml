  it s always such a shame to read about local governments cutting spending and raising taxes to make ends meet in the midst of an economic downturn _meta_end_dot_

 this sort of thing only does further harm to the economy _meta_end_dot_

 what you ought to have is a situation where surpluses are built up during the fat years and spent down during the lean ones _meta_end_dot_

 obviously you can see why practical politicians in the real world don t behave that way but states could presumably adopt rules requiring local governments to do that _meta_end_dot_
