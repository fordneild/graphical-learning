  ross suggests term limits for the major op ed pages _meta_end_dot_

 i think it s a pretty good idea _meta_end_dot_

 most of all though i d like to see the new york times abandon its twice a week frequency _meta_end_dot_

 the times current practice seems implicitly based on the idea that the number of truly worthwhile columnists is so tiny that it s better to accept the hit in quality that comes from making the columnists write so frequently than it would be to water down the page _meta_end_dot_

 but surely the reverse is the case _meta_end_dot_

 it s a great big world out there and having the columnists write less frequently would let all of them write better and open up the space for a greater variety of voices _meta_end_dot_

 instead of david brooks twice a week brooks once a week and an interesting libertarian like virginia postrel once a week _meta_end_dot_

 that kind of thing _meta_end_dot_

 it seems like no brainer to me _meta_end_dot_

 surely this is a sufficiently desirable job that they could have their pick of writers from all throughout the country _meta_end_dot_
