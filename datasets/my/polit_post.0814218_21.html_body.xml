  this issue isn t on most people s radar screens but it really would be nice if we emulated other countries and made different bills different sizes so that blind people could tell the difference between a _meta_dollor_ref_ bill and a _meta_dollor_ref_ bill _meta_end_dot_

 while we re at it in fact we can get rid of the _meta_dollor_ref_ bill and replace it with a coin and scrap the penny too _meta_end_dot_

 that s change i can believe in _meta_end_dot_
