  ilan goldenberg notes that while the us elections may get a bit nasty provincial elections in iraq could actually touch off a new round of bloodshed _meta_end_dot_

 his analysis seems smart but i also agree with eric martin that it seems that not holding the elections could also touch of a new round of bloodshed long story short it s just the case that the underlying tensions in iraq continue to make it the case that we need to be looking for the exits not devising new rationales for an indefinite presence _meta_end_dot_
