  spencer ackerman offered a gentle critique of his friend george packer s essay on iraq in the premiere issue of the new world affairs journal _meta_end_dot_

 i d go a bit further i think this very much represents the worst of packer s writing on iraq rather than the best _meta_end_dot_

 it opens with some striking on the ground reporting from iraq then shifts to a discussion of how un visceral these events are to most americans who are far more distanced from the conflict than we were from vietnam and earlier wars _meta_end_dot_

 eventually though it shifts into a kind of lame plea for open mindedness so the lines were drawn from the start _meta_end_dot_

 to the pro war side criticism was animated by partisanship and defeatism if not treason _meta_end_dot_

 this view amplified on cable news talk radio and right wing blogs was tacitly encouraged by the white house _meta_end_dot_

 it kept a disastrous defense secretary in office long after it was obvious that he was losing the war ensured that no senior officer was held accountable for military setbacks and contributed to the repetition of disastrous errors by the war s political architects _meta_end_dot_

 meanwhile the fact that the best and brightest iraqis were being slaughtered by a ruthless insurgency never aroused much interest or sympathy among the war s opponents _meta_end_dot_

 the kind of people who would ordinarily inspire solidarity campaigns among western progressives trade unionists journalists human rights advocates women s rights activists independent politicians doctors professors were being systematically exterminated _meta_end_dot_

 but since the war shouldn t have been fought in the first place what began badly must also end badly _meta_end_dot_

 note that even in packer s somewhat tendentious accounting there s no actual parallelism here _meta_end_dot_

 war supporters invested in the idea that they were right when they were in fact wrong blinded themselves to actual developments on the ground in iraq _meta_end_dot_

 war opponents were by contrast what _meta_end_question_

 it s hard to say _meta_end_dot_

 not blinded by denial that terrible things were happening in iraq _meta_end_dot_

 but i guess not affected by these terrible happenings in the way packer thinks would have been appropriate _meta_end_question_

 insufficiently surprised that a war they d always regarded as ill advised turned out to be ill advised _meta_end_question_

 it s not clear _meta_end_dot_

 as we go deeper this continues to be the pattern _meta_end_dot_

 packer sees a very schematic united states of america _meta_end_dot_

 one where pro war journalists and bloggers deride the piece as fraudulent and anti military even before evidence is in on the scott beauchamp case _meta_end_dot_

 similarly when two center left think tank analysts return from a trip to iraq and declare in an op ed that the surge has produced military successes the response is that by the next morning anti war journalists and bloggers are in full cry deriding the piece as credulous dishonest and self serving this did happen but it s curious that packer doesn t name the think tank analysts _meta_end_dot_

 well their names are kenneth pollack and michael o hanlon and whatever else one might say about pollack and o hanlon it s certainly not the case that left of center people have been blindly ignoring their views throughout the course of the iraq debate _meta_end_dot_

 quite the reverse pollack s the threatening storm was hugely influential and o hanlon was for years one of the most prominent national security analysts in america _meta_end_dot_

 similarly given packer s dystopian vision of american discourse it s hard to understand how packer s book the assassin s gate sold so many copies and attracted such wide praise or how packer came to have a job with the most prestigious magazine in the country a magazine which published a lot of basically pro war material in _meta_number_ref_ and _meta_number_ref_ and went on to vociferously denounce george w _meta_end_dot_

 bush in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 the reality is that the american political debate from _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ to today has been enormously complex _meta_end_dot_

 a once popular war has become highly unpopular _meta_end_dot_

 a great many people myself included have not only changed our minds about the war but changed our minds about a larger set of concerns _meta_end_dot_

 the market for the sort of serious thoughtful reporting and analysis packer has brought us from the region has actually been very large _meta_end_dot_

 people from differing political perspectives came together to contribute essays to a new journal called world affairs _meta_end_dot_

 howard dean rose and fell then kinda sorta rose again to become dnc chair _meta_end_dot_

 joe lieberman lost the democratic nomination but secured election as an independent _meta_end_dot_

 the distance between america and iraq that packer writes about is real enough and it s quite true that the war exists as a kind of abstraction a faint presence _meta_end_dot_

 but the dumb and indifferent public senselessly processing information through fixed partisan blinders just isn t there the country wasn t evenly split on the war in the summer of _meta_number_ref_ and it s not evenly split today either a lot of debate has happened and a lot of people have changed their minds _meta_end_dot_

 indeed that changing of minds has in many ways been the central fact of american politics in recent years _meta_end_dot_
