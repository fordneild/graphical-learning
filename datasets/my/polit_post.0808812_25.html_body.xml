  via kay steiger the influence of feminist ascription on judgements of women s physical attractiveness by viren swamia natalie salemb adrian furnhamb and martin j _meta_end_dot_

 tov ec the present study examined the effect of feminist ascription on perceptions of the physical attractiveness of women ranging in body mass index bmi _meta_end_dot_

 one hundred and twenty nine women who self identified as feminists and _meta_number_ref_ who self identified as non feminists rated a series of _meta_number_ref_ images of women that varied in bmi from emaciated to obese _meta_end_dot_

 results showed no significant differences between feminist and non feminists in the figure they considered to be maximally attractive _meta_end_dot_

 however feminists were more likely to positively perceive a wider range of body sizes than non feminists _meta_end_dot_

 these results are discussed in relation to possible protective factors against the internalisation of the thin ideal and body objectification _meta_end_dot_

 i suppose that s about what i would have expected ideological commitment has a real but circumscribed impact on perception _meta_end_dot_
