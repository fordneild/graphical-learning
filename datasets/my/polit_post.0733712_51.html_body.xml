  i guess if hugo ch vez can t even get majority support in a referendum for proposed changes to the constitution that he can t be much of an aspiring dictator can he _meta_end_question_

 on the merits i m obviously not an expert in such things but ch vez s proposals an end to presidential term limits plus concentration of more power in the president s office are probably a bad idea for a country like venezuela and it s probably a good thing that they were defeated _meta_end_dot_

 still the level of pious screeching about ch vez s authoritarianism from people who think the dictators emirs etc of qatar bahrain uae etc _meta_end_dot_

 should be treated with nothing but the utmost respect has always chafed _meta_end_dot_
