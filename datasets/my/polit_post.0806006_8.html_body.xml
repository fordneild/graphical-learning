  here s some of pastor john hagee s thoughts on the jews it was the disobedience and rebellion of the jews god s chosen people to their covenantal responsibility to serve only the one true god jehovah that gave rise to the opposition and persecution that they experienced beginning in canaan and continuing to this very day _meta_end_dot_

 basically we got what was coming to us _meta_end_dot_

 under the circumstances it s hardly surprising that hagee might look favorably on a foreign policy aimed at prompting the destruction of israel at the hands of a russo arab coalition though it is a bit odd that he s named his pressure group designed to advance this agenda christians united for israel even odder many of the erstwhile leaders of the american jewish community have chosen to embrace the person in question _meta_end_dot_

 john mccain naturally is very proud to have pastor john hagee s support meanwhile hagee seems to hate catholics about as much as jews and muslims quite a bit more so _meta_end_dot_

 mccain has a lot to be proud of _meta_end_dot_
