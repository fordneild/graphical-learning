  brad delong takes me to task noting that though t he inheritance of inequality is strikingly large in america today the inheritance of iq has relatively little to do with it _meta_end_dot_

 here s math if inherited genetically based iq were the source of the extra edge that the children of the rich get in our society than we would expect a parent with _meta_number_ref_ times average lifetime full time earnings say _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ a year to have a kid with a lifetime average income of _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ instead of the average of _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 but it is not _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 it is _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 true and important and i didn t want to say otherwise _meta_end_dot_

 what i wanted to inject into this is that while we can change people s childhood environments in a forward looking way or look at adoption studies for research purposes in practice most people aren t newborn babies and we re obviously not and shouldn t in practice going to reassign children to new families _meta_end_dot_

 consequently the precise degree to which things are inherited genetically versus environmentally is of limited relevance in thinking about how people deserve to be treated _meta_end_dot_

 if you allow a large degree of inequality to exist then children will grow up in sharply unequal environments and the people who grow up in those environments will suffer from lifelong disadvantages for reasons that are completely outside of their control _meta_end_dot_
