  when i stayed at one of your hotels recently and asked if it would be possible to email a copy of my receipt to me and your clerk said yes i was hoping for a copy of the receipt to be emailed to me and was not hoping to be inundated with spam on a near daily basis _meta_end_dot_

 action on either of those points would be appreciated _meta_end_dot_
