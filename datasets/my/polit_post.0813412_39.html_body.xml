  barack obama speaking to the atlantic s jeffrey goldberg offered a sensible reply to a sensible but sensitive question jg do you think that israel is a drag on america s reputation overseas _meta_end_question_

 bo no no no _meta_end_dot_

 but what i think is that this constant wound that this constant sore does infect all of our foreign policy _meta_end_dot_

 the lack of a resolution to this problem provides an excuse for anti american militant jihadists to engage in inexcusable actions and so we have a national security interest in solving this and i also believe that israel has a security interest in solving this because i believe that the status quo is unsustainable _meta_end_dot_

 gop reps _meta_end_dot_

 john boehner and eric cantor decided to prove they studied hard in the school of misreading and misrepresenting it is truly disappointing that senator obama called israel a constant wound constant sore and that it infect s all of our foreign policy these sorts of words and characterizations are the words of a politician with a deep misunderstanding of the middle east and an innate distrust of israel _meta_end_dot_

 eliding here is the difference between calling israel the country a sore and calling the israeli palestinian conflict a sore _meta_end_dot_

 but i guess reps _meta_end_dot_

 boehner and cantor think the conflict is a good thing that s helpful to israelis and makes america s relationships with other arab political actors easier _meta_end_question_

 andrew sullivan marc ambinder and goldberg offer further commentary _meta_end_dot_

 i ll just say that at the end of the day i think israel and israelis will be better off with an american president who thinks the conflict is a serious problem that he ll put a relatively high priority on than with a president who intends to pay israel the false compliment of pretending that the situation is somehow no big deal _meta_end_dot_
