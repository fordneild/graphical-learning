  as usual with calls for less partisanship and more moderation the striking thing about this new initiative is its vacuousness _meta_end_dot_

 there are two kinds of thing a centrist movement might reasonably stand for _meta_end_dot_

 one would be a middle ground approach to issues democrats think federal revenues should be at x percent of gdp republicans think it should be at y percent but we say it should be at x y _meta_number_ref_ percent of gdp another would be to hold a mish mash of left wing positions on some issues and right wing positions on others we should reduce carbon emissions by _meta_number_ref_ percent by _meta_number_ref_ through a _meta_number_ref_ percent auction of tradable emissions permits and we should privatize social security one might of course also have a combination of the two sorts of things _meta_end_dot_

 so what do we hear _meta_end_question_

 well according to stu loesser press secretary for michael bloomberg as mayor he has seen far too often how hyperpartisanship in washington has gotten in the way of making progress on a host of issues which issues _meta_end_question_

 and what would constitute progress on them _meta_end_question_

 loesser doesn t say _meta_end_dot_

 similarly david boren says that our hope is that the candidates will respond with their own specific ideas about how to pull the country together not just aim at getting out their own polarized base this though is just talk about political strategies _meta_end_dot_

 and if both countries put forward policies designed to appeal to the median voter the result will be _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 polarization and election outcomes that hinge on the mobilization of one s base _meta_end_dot_

 missing from boren s account is any hint of what kinds of positions he thinks are being squeezed out in the current dynamic _meta_end_dot_

 and there s the rub _meta_end_dot_

 there are only two political parties _meta_end_dot_

 under the circumstances polarization is all but inevitable _meta_end_dot_

 third parties meanwhile never succeed in the united states but do often wind up having an impact on the course of events _meta_end_dot_

 but to have an impact you have to have some kind of point of view that you re advancing _meta_end_dot_

 big time third party candidacies strom thurmond _meta_number_ref_ george wallace _meta_number_ref_ ross perot _meta_number_ref_ aren t based on generic appeals to bringing the country together they re based on policy agendas that neither major party reflects _meta_end_dot_

 you could imagine a third party campaign based on ron paul s brand of libertarian nationalism but all boren bloomberg et _meta_end_dot_

 al _meta_end_dot_

 have are platitudes _meta_end_dot_
