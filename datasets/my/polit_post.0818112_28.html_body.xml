  i m a very bad tourist in terms of looking things up in advance and planning _meta_end_dot_

 but i always enjoy doing things this way seeing something cool is twice as cool when unexpected _meta_end_dot_

 george seurat s a sunday on la grande jatte is one of my favorite paintings well liked enough that i swiftly made it the wallpaper on my iphone when i get it _meta_end_dot_

 and then yesterday i was ambling around the art institute of chicago and unexpectedly there it was _meta_end_exclamation_

 naturally i then took a photo with the iphone and set that to be my wallpaper _meta_end_dot_

 but wallpaper aside the point is that not knowing what the collection s highlights are until you get a chance to look around preserves a certain element of the thrill of discovery even though obviously it s already a super famous painting _meta_end_dot_
