  obama wins hawaii by a crushing _meta_number_ref_ to _meta_number_ref_ margin _meta_end_dot_

 here for once the doesn t count concept does carry some real weight since obama grew up there _meta_end_dot_

 of course hillary clinton grew up in illinois where obama got _meta_number_ref_ percent of the vote and obama did manage to pull a _meta_number_ref_ percent in new york which though pretty bad is at least better than clinton could do in either of obama two home states _meta_end_dot_
