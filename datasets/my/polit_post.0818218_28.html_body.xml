  i think chad ford amptly sums up gilbert arenas free agent status the biggest issue for arenas is the same one that plagues all the free agents who else has the money to pay him _meta_end_question_

 i can t see the _meta_number_ref_ers or grizzlies spending the cash _meta_end_dot_

 the clippers would have interest but arenas already spurned them once _meta_end_dot_

 that s why i find things like this so hard to understand according to a league source familiar with the situation wizards president ernie grunfeld plans on soon offering arenas a lucrative long term contract one that could cover up to six years and could be worth more than _meta_dollor_ref_ million it would be one thing if the clippers had actually offered arenas say a _meta_dollor_ref_ million contract and the wizards were countering _meta_end_dot_

 that kind of money would still in my view be a mistake but i could understand it on some level _meta_end_dot_

 but why make a pre emptive bid like that _meta_end_dot_
