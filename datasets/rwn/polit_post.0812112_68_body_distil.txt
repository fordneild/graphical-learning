  even after spending _meta_number_ref_ years being friends with jeremiah wright and listening to his sermons barack obama assured people that he didn t know about his extreme views and that people were taking wright s comments out of context _meta_end_dot_

 meanwhile pretty much everyone else in america pegged wright as a racist anti american demagogue _meta_end_dot_

 well now wright has come out publicly and affirmed pretty much the worst things that people thought about him _meta_end_dot_

 he s anti white he s anti american and he s a kook _meta_end_dot_

 so obama s press conference aside then either _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ obama is so dim witted and such a terrible judge of character that he actually meant what he said and just didn t understand how bad wright was _meta_end_dot_

 if that s true then he really just doesn t have the people skills to be the president of the united states _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ obama has known what wright was all about for the last _meta_number_ref_ years at worst agreed with it and at best wasn t bothered by it and simply lied because he knew the american people wouldn t support an unpatriotic racialist candidate who despises white people _meta_end_dot_

 whatever the answer is it means that obama isn t fit to be president of the united states _meta_end_dot_
