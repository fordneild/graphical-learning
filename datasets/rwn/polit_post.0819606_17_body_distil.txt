  i m heartbroken to hear of tony snow s death _meta_end_dot_

 here was a man whose life could teach something to all of us conservative and liberal alike _meta_end_dot_

 now that he has passed after his fight with cancer america has truly lost one of its classiest most encouraging and humble figureheads and role models _meta_end_dot_

 and as silly as it may sound this man who vice president cheney now calls the best white house press secretary he d seen in his _meta_number_ref_ years in washington has in fact made a real impact on my own view of politics and of life _meta_end_dot_

 unlike most people who have been surrounded by politics all their lives tony snow never seemed to become disenchanted bitter or hardened as i often find myself by the often disappointing reality of this game instead he lived his life with what he called optimism based on deep faith and it exuded from his character so strongly that even his adversaries admitted to liking ad respecting him _meta_end_dot_

 as cnn correspondent ed henry recalls with a certain fondness rather than holding some silly grudge he was ever the gentleman _meta_end_dot_

 oh he would needle you and get his shot in alright but he would do it in a humorous way that reinforced what will be his enduring legacy to me life is too short to get yourself all worked up about one tense exchange one awkward moment or one misstep _meta_end_dot_

 snow showed his true colors a few months later when we had another battle in the briefing room and later in the day we ran into each other on the white house north lawn _meta_end_dot_

 snow s loyal assistant a great young staffer named ed buckley came upon the scene and jokingly suggested we were about to come to blows _meta_end_dot_

 i m going to have to buy you two boxing gloves one of these days buckley said _meta_end_dot_

 nope snow immediately interjected saying we both were just doing our jobs _meta_end_dot_

 it s never personal you want to know what tony snow was all about _meta_end_question_

 you ve got your answer right there _meta_end_dot_

 one of the few guys in this tough town who understood how to draw that line _meta_end_dot_

 i ve often wondered why we don t see more political leaders out there who are like tony snow and why more people did not emulate his integrity and positivism _meta_end_dot_

 on television he seemed to radiate with a sense of energy and enthusiasm in person this sense was even stronger _meta_end_dot_

 i ll never forget the few times i saw him speak i don t believe i ll ever see someone else in his line of work with such an aura of joy as snow as he spoke about conservatism and america _meta_end_dot_

 one such account from this year s cpac can be found here _meta_end_dot_

 i remember sitting in the media room at the end of cpac last february as snow walked by after making the event s closing speech one that had left the audience buzzing with awe and excitement _meta_end_dot_

 naturally he was swarmed by fans fighting for his attention as he tried to leave the building _meta_end_dot_

 i watched curiously to see how he responded interested to see if he was truly the friendly gentleman he was so reputed to be _meta_end_dot_

 of course i wasn t disappointed _meta_end_dot_

 snow only a few hundred feet from the door stopped multiple times on his way to listen to admirers and shake their hands _meta_end_dot_

 i was touched by the amount of time he took and how kindly he treated each one as if he were genuinely interested in what each of them had to say _meta_end_dot_

 as if he were one to actually practice what he preached _meta_end_dot_

 and now snow s death has caused america to reflect on all the great things he embodied in his life _meta_end_dot_

 one thing is for sure snow s life was not one lived in vain _meta_end_dot_

 perhaps if we re wise we might try to follow his example of maintaining integrity in the political realm something that we don t see often anymore _meta_end_dot_

 politicians on both sides of the aisle would do well to take his lead _meta_end_dot_

 cross posted at conservatives with attitude _meta_end_exclamation_
