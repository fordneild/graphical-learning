  maybe this is why we laugh the republican s number manipulation games again prepare for another stolen election _meta_end_exclamation_

 let me rephrase this for the fuzzy of thinking the democrats mental manipulation games again prepare for another delusion _meta_end_exclamation_

 the hysteria gripping the left is the fear borne of an inability to face the truth no election was stolen _meta_end_dot_

 they lost _meta_end_dot_

 the american people chose a different way _meta_end_dot_

 and if we re fortunate the american people will choose sensibly again _meta_end_dot_

 and that will mean not voting for barack obama and joe biden but for john mccain and sarah sarahcuda palin _meta_end_dot_

 i hope mccain wins by a landslide so their delusion has less room to flourish _meta_end_dot_
