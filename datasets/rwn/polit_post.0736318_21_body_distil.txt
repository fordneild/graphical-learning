  well don t get me wrong he s had many many potential ones _meta_end_dot_

 he has had to come back and correct his mis statements with the media too many times _meta_end_dot_

 why is this one the major one _meta_end_question_

 it is the one that the msm is actually picking up on _meta_end_dot_

 i heard ol carl cameron on fox news just say that his response to the bhutto assassination is really getting to iowa voters and that his response wasn t something worthy of a person wanting the mantle of the oval office _meta_end_dot_

 don t quote that but it s close i m sure _meta_end_dot_

 cnn anyway i m sure cameron said this for mike huckabee this is the moment he was not looking forward to _meta_end_dot_

 after riding a surge to the top of the polls in iowa now his own jokes about not having foreign policy experience the one in which he said but i stayed in a holiday inn express last night is precisely the kind of stuff that can trip him up _meta_end_dot_

 ny times on thursday night he told reporters in orlando fla we ought to have an immediate very clear monitoring of our borders and particularly to make sure if there s any unusual activity of pakistanis coming into the country on friday in pella iowa he expanded on those remarks _meta_end_dot_

 when i say single them out i am making the observation that we have more pakistani illegals coming across our border than all other nationalities except those immediately south of the border he told reporters in pella _meta_end_dot_

 and in light of what is happening in pakistan it ought to give us pause as to why are so many illegals coming across these borders in fact far more illegal immigrants come from the philippines korea china and vietnam according to recent estimates from the department of homeland security _meta_end_dot_

 asked how a border fence would help keep out pakistani immigrants mr _meta_end_dot_

 huckabee argued that airplane security was already strong but that security at the southern united states border was dangerously weak _meta_end_dot_

 the fact is that the immigration issue is not so much about people coming to pick lettuce or make beds it s about someone coming with a shoulder fired missile he said _meta_end_dot_

 the sudden emergency in pakistan and mr _meta_end_dot_

 huckabee s response come at a time when he has come under increasing scrutiny from opponents for his lack of fluency in foreign policy issues and the situation in pakistan appeared to have challenged him _meta_end_dot_

 we have seen what happens in the musharraf government mr _meta_end_dot_

 huckabee said on msnbc _meta_end_dot_

 he has told us he does not have enough control of those eastern borders near afghanistan to be able go after the terrorists _meta_end_dot_

 but on the other hand did he not want us going in so what do we do those borders are actually on the west not the east _meta_end_dot_

 further he offered an orlando crowd his apologies for what has happened in pakistan his aides said later that he meant to say sympathies he also said he was worried about martial law continuing in pakistan although mr _meta_end_dot_

 musharraf lifted the state of emergency on dec _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 his campaign told cbs news that his statement was not a blunder _meta_end_dot_

 allahpundit the media s covering this with surprising attentiveness doubtless not so much because of huck s shakiness on the facts than his audacious suggestion that people hailing from the nation where the real terrorists are and behaving unusually might warrant a bit of extra scrutiny _meta_end_dot_

 oh well _meta_end_dot_

 if that s what it takes to get them off the huck bandwagon so be it _meta_end_dot_

 attack media _meta_end_exclamation_

 attack like the wind _meta_end_exclamation_

 dan riehl i guess the blush is off the rose as far as the media and huckabee are concerned _meta_end_dot_

 romney s ground game in iowa should either give him a win or a closer second than what some may be thinking _meta_end_dot_

 by super tuesday i imagine huckabee will be done _meta_end_dot_

 but it remains unclear how the rest of the race will play out _meta_end_dot_

 here was frank s response more recently huckabee has also claimed that former ambassador john bolton is among his advisers _meta_end_dot_

 ready to see more huckabee backpedaling _meta_end_question_

 bolton responds in recent days mike huckabee has tried to answer long standing questions about who is on his foreign policy team _meta_end_dot_

 on friday morning he listed former u n _meta_end_dot_

 ambassador john bolton as someone with whom he either has spoken or will continue to speak at a thursday evening press conference huckabee said i ve corresponded with john bolton who s agreed to work with us on developing foreign policy bolton however has a different view _meta_end_dot_

 i d be happy to speak with huckabee but i haven t spoken with him yet said bolton now a senior fellow at the american enterprise institute a conservative think tank in washington i m not an official or unofficial adviser to anyone said bolton who mentioned he d had conversations with other republican candidates but refused to name any names _meta_end_dot_

 rob at say anything this goes beyond mere cluelessness to outright stupidity _meta_end_dot_

 i would think that the millions of mexican illegals who flow across our border every year would be enough to warrant a border fence without resorting to rather bizarre concerns over illegals coming from a nation on the other side of the globe _meta_end_dot_

 but huckabee s concerns about pakistani illegals are even more bizarre when you factor in his support for entitlements for illegal immigrants already in this country _meta_end_dot_

 it gets even worse _meta_end_dot_

 i think it is simple _meta_end_dot_

 huckabee jumps the gun on a current issue in order to patch up his weak positions on the border and immigration _meta_end_dot_

 he gets too eager and doesn t make sure of the facts _meta_end_dot_

 presidential material _meta_end_question_

 i don t think so _meta_end_dot_

 hey iowa just follow peggy s advice _meta_end_dot_

 be reasonable _meta_end_dot_

 in the meantime lets get huckabee a map _meta_end_dot_

 not your foreign policy candidate for sure _meta_end_dot_

 other huckabee highlights not the safest hunter for sure _meta_end_dot_

 huckabee makes the top ten list of most wanted corrupt politicians _meta_end_dot_

 rudy makes the list as well _meta_end_dot_

 four out of ten are presidential candidates _meta_end_dot_
