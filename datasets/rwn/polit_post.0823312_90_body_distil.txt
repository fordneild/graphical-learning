  i m a fan of kathleen parker s work and enjoyed interviewing her but i can t say that i agree with her sentiments about rick warren s saddleback forum even though i m sure that more than a few people reading rwn today share them at the risk of heresy let it be said that setting up the two presidential candidates for religious interrogation by an evangelical minister no matter how beloved is supremely wrong _meta_end_dot_

 it is also un american _meta_end_dot_

 this is about higher principles that are compromised every time we pretend we re not applying a religious test when we re really applying a religious test _meta_end_dot_

 it is true that no one was forced to participate in the saddleback civil forum on the presidency and that both mccain and obama are free agents _meta_end_dot_

 warren has a right to invite whomever he wishes to his church and to ask them whatever they re willing to answer _meta_end_dot_

 his format and questions were interesting and the answers more revealing than what the usual debate menu provides _meta_end_dot_

 but does it not seem just a little bit odd to have mccain and obama chatting individually with a preacher in a public forum about their positions on evil and their relationship with jesus christ _meta_end_question_

 warren tried to defuse criticism about staging the interviews in his church by saying that though we believe in the separation of church and state we don t believe in the separation of faith and politics _meta_end_dot_

 faith he said is just a worldview and everybody has some kind of worldview _meta_end_dot_

 it s important to know what they are presumably we refers to warren s church of fellow evangelicals _meta_end_dot_

 and while yes everybody has some kind of worldview it shouldn t be necessary in a pluralistic nation of secular laws to publicly define that view in christian code let s consider the modern political world not in a bubble or the context of how things were fifty years ago in america but in the real world we live in _meta_end_dot_

 in particular let s consider three things _meta_end_dot_

 first off everything and i do mean everything about a political candidate ends up being considered fair game for a campaign _meta_end_dot_

 whether bill clinton had sex with that woman whether george bush was awol in the national guard _meta_number_ref_ years ago even though the military s records say he wasn t the sexual orientation of dick cheney s daughter it all turns into grist for the mill _meta_end_dot_

 secondly there is practically no segment of the american electorate that is not targeted by political candidates _meta_end_dot_

 john kerry conspicuously goes duck hunting john mccain went to the sturgis bike rally and the democrats are bending over backwards to get as many felons on the voting rolls as possible all across the united states _meta_end_dot_

 third as the government has become larger and more powerful it has stuck its nose into an ever larger portion of the public domain _meta_end_dot_

 the government gets involved in every decision from whether or not you wear a seatbelt to whether you are allowed to plow your own land or have to leave it fallow for fear of harming some endangered woodland creature to what kind of lightbulbs you can have in your house _meta_end_dot_

 so let s consider all these factors in concert political campaigns cover every personal detail of a candidate s life politicians target every segment of the electorate and the government affects every part of people s lives _meta_end_dot_

 with that in mind given that roughly _meta_percent_ref_ of the american public is christian many of them do take matters of faith into account when they vote and the government is going to intrude into their faith s business what s the problem supposed to be with having candidates answer questions about their christian beliefs _meta_end_question_

 the warren forum certainly doesn t meet the constitutional standard of a religious test particularly since the candidates don t have to attend _meta_end_dot_

 as a matter of fact during the republican primaries there was a values voter debate that was designed to appeal to religious conservatives and none of the top tier candidates bothered to show up _meta_end_dot_

 so had mccain or obama not wanted to do warren s event that would have been that and it would have been a minor story that would have gone down the memory hole in a day _meta_end_dot_

 however since the candidates apparently wanted to attend since the debate covered issues people vote on and since it was designed to appeal to a large segment of the american populace what s the problem _meta_end_question_

 i d say nothing particularly since as we all know there are going to be atheists and secular humanists continuing to use the power of government to attack christianity and squash our religious rights over the next few years _meta_end_dot_

 so why shouldn t christians have an opportunity to ask the candidates where they stand on these issues _meta_end_question_

 if you are a christian the federal government is going to be doing things that impact your religious freedom _meta_end_dot_

 so you had better take that into consideration and put people into power who are as concerned about safeguarding your religious interests as you are _meta_end_dot_

 for that reason i think the saddleback forum served an important purpose even if i wasn t in love with the format or some of the questions _meta_end_dot_
