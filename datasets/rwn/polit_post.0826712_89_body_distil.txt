  well not exactly _meta_end_dot_

 technically it s men with traditional gender attitudes make more money _meta_end_dot_

 that makes me wonder if men with those attitudes demand more money because their wives don t work _meta_end_dot_

 or is it that employers are sexist and pay men with wives at home more because they know the family has one income _meta_end_question_

 true story my brother s boss gave him a raise immediately when he found out that they were pregnant with their first kid and said well you need to take care of your family now do men who bear the sole financial responsibility to support the family ask for more money _meta_end_question_
