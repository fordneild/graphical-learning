  mohammed elmasry head of the canadian idiotic congress today clarified his views on a number of issues in an attempt to construct a grand unified field theory of retardation based on the stupidest things he s said in the last _meta_number_ref_ years _meta_end_dot_

 still stinging from reaction to his comments on the michael coren show in _meta_number_ref_ that every israeli citizen above the age of _meta_number_ref_ is a combatant and a legitimate target of muslim terrorism elmasry explained today i was wrong _meta_end_dot_

 i admit it _meta_end_dot_

 the strangulation of a canadian muslim girl by her muslim father for refusing to wear the completely voluntary muslim headscarf which is and is not a muslim symbol depending on what day of the week you ask me has helped me see the truth _meta_end_dot_

 that truth is that we have to lower the age of legitimate targets of violence to around age eleven _meta_end_dot_

 it is now clear to me that teenagers are a real problem and i should have included them in my original remarks about who it s ok to murder with nail bombs _meta_end_dot_

 for that initial lapse i apologize now get off my lawn you damn kids _meta_number_ref_ the day after i michelle malkin and others mocked el mo for referring to canada s first muslim honor killing as a teenager issue he issued a new press release with lots of nicer sounding stuff in it _meta_end_dot_

 i m just sayin
