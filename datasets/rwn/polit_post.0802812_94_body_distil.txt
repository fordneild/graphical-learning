  here s an email that i received this week end like a lot of conservatives i m shaking my head in disbelief at the way this primary season is going _meta_end_dot_

 believe me i m not asking this question to gloat in fact it is just the opposite _meta_end_dot_

 why has the conservative blogosphere been so ineffective in the primaries _meta_end_question_

 a year ago most bloggers were expressing great interest if not a preference for duncan hunter _meta_end_dot_

 he never made it out of low single digits _meta_end_dot_

 then it was fred thompson overwhelmingly the choice of the conservative blogosphere _meta_end_dot_

 he went nowhere and dropped out of the race _meta_end_dot_

 underlying much of this has been staunch opposition to john mccain who is now leading the race _meta_end_dot_

 is the blogosphere out of touch with the base of the party _meta_end_question_

 it seems that it is leading the parade except that if you turn around nobody is following _meta_end_dot_

 how can the blogosphere become more influential _meta_end_question_

 i think this is the heart of the problem _meta_end_dot_

 there is a great deal of good conservative thought and opinion but apparently little or no actual impact _meta_end_dot_

 how can that be changed _meta_end_question_

 is the blogosphere too negative _meta_end_question_

 too ready to eat our own _meta_end_question_

 dissent is a good thing _meta_end_dot_

 however i believe some bloggers and responders absolutely wallow in it _meta_end_dot_

 in particular when thompson entered the race there was a great deal of nose up sniffing and second guessing and belabored criticism of fred right out of the gate _meta_end_dot_

 i m not blaming blogs for thompson s showing but i don t think they helped much _meta_end_dot_

 our beloved michelle malkin was particularly critical for example _meta_end_dot_

 it was almost as if most bloggers were playing hard to get _meta_end_dot_

 this does nothing to build excitement for a candidate and casual readers are simply left to assume nobody is really a good pick _meta_end_dot_

 if this is true then the blogs had an influence but it was a negative one _meta_end_dot_

 professional rivalries _meta_end_question_

 i have no idea _meta_end_dot_

 i read a lot of blogs and rivalry is going to be inevitable _meta_end_dot_

 but i wonder if there is a lot going on behind the scenes we readers don t know about _meta_end_dot_

 maybe it is best left there _meta_end_dot_

 but wouldn t it be nice to see some bare hint of infrastructure allowing joint projects across the geographically dispersed blogosphere _meta_end_dot_

 for example candidate recruitment for congressional races _meta_end_dot_

 sugar daddies _meta_end_question_

 my guess is that money is a big part of the issue _meta_end_dot_

 it may not take much money to start a blog but it probably takes a lot to make one a national focus and even more to coordinate actions across many blogs _meta_end_dot_

 has anyone done a business plan or concept paper to coordinate conservative blogs on specific projects that can be shopped to wealthy not me supporters _meta_end_question_

 or turned into a project that little guys me can contribute to _meta_end_question_

 john i read your blog regularly try to click on the ads occasionally and hope that you can at some point lay out a response to the issues i ve raised here _meta_end_dot_

 i have no hidden agenda here just want to see conservatism be more effective in the future damav first of all it is correct to say that the blogosphere s two favorite candidates have been duncan hunter and fred thompson both of whom obviously are out of the race _meta_end_dot_

 also it s worth noting that on the left side of the blogosphere they backed john edwards and only started gravitating towards barack obama when it became obvious that edwards wasn t going anywhere _meta_end_dot_

 so that begs the question why wasn t the blogosphere able to provide more help to its favorite sons _meta_end_question_

 well to be blunt we re just not big enough _meta_end_dot_

 getting into more detail as i ve said before when it comes to the blogosphere it s the who not the how many bloggers generally make a difference by finding stories that have been missed angles that haven t been worked or by breaking stories and getting bigger outlets to pay attention to them _meta_end_dot_

 however in a presidential race the bigger outlets are already paying attention and trying to come up with new angles _meta_end_dot_

 moreover if there is a story broken it ll probably be because an opposition researcher with one of the campaigns finds something on an opponent and forwards it to a msm outlet _meta_end_dot_

 in other words in a presidential race there are too many other large forces at play for bloggers to have a big impact _meta_end_dot_

 can we have a big impact in other races _meta_end_question_

 yes but there are limits there as well _meta_end_dot_

 in a primary race for the house or senate bloggers can and have made differences _meta_end_dot_

 think about ned lamont beating joe lieberman for example _meta_end_dot_

 what about in the general elections _meta_end_question_

 there again bloggers have a chance to make an impact at least in the house elections because especially in the less hotly contested ones _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ which is a sum bloggers can help raise can swing a general election _meta_end_dot_

 moreover there are so many house races going on that the mainstream media has trouble keeping up with them all _meta_end_dot_

 so again that s right down the blogosphere s alley _meta_end_dot_

 in a senate race from what i have seen the blogosphere just doesn t have the strength to make much of a difference _meta_end_dot_

 even _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ which bloggers have difficulty raising for a candidate is a drop in the bucket in a hotly contested race and since there aren t as many close senate races the msm big conservative media is already all over them _meta_end_dot_

 then when you get to the presidential race where there is constant coverage and the money gets really big bloggers are just guppies in a shark tank _meta_end_dot_

 so is it a case where bloggers are leading the parade but no one is following _meta_end_question_

 no people are following but the parade is just too small _meta_end_dot_

 ps for more on the conservative media and the presidential race also see has conservative talk radio been defanged _meta_end_question_
