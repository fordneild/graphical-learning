  yeah yeah i usually start sunday off with a patriotic pinup post but this one is too juicy to hold off on _meta_end_dot_

 after _meta_number_ref_ holes of golf saturday and all the beer afterwards if i do not write it my head may explode _meta_end_dot_

 on the _meta_number_ref_ stages of liberal progressive discussion when they know they are busted a _meta_number_ref_ is find some sort of moral equivalence or a story from _meta_number_ref_ years ago saying a conservative did something sort of similar well starting out at the huffpo moving to oliver willis and then to talk left with more lefties certainly chiming in shortly we seem them attempting to say that john mccain said the same thing as snob ama it s the influx of illegals into places where they ve never seen a hispanic influence before mccain told me _meta_end_dot_

 you probably see more emotion in iowa than you do in arizona on this issue _meta_end_dot_

 i was in a town in iowa and twenty years ago there were no hispanics in the town _meta_end_dot_

 then a meatpacking facility was opened up _meta_end_dot_

 now twenty per cent of their population is hispanic _meta_end_dot_

 there were senior citizens there who were concerned is not the word _meta_end_dot_

 they see this as an assault on their culture what they view as an impact on what have been their traditions in iowa in the small towns in iowa _meta_end_dot_

 so you get questions like why do i have to punch _meta_number_ref_ for english why can t they speak english it s become larger than just the fact that we need to enforce our borders you go into these small towns in pennsylvania and like a lot of small towns in the midwest the jobs have been gone now for _meta_number_ref_ years and nothing s replaced them _meta_end_dot_

 and it s not surprising then they get bitter they cling to guns or religion or antipathy to people who aren t like them or anti immigrant sentiment or anti trade sentiment as a way to explain their frustrations _meta_end_dot_

 tom maguire wrote hmm mccain forgot to trash the origin or depth of anyone s religious convictions or suggest that immigration turned them into gun nuts so i don t quite see the equivalence impressively kyle e _meta_end_dot_

 moore at comments from left field does not join the current _meta_number_ref_ meme and says that mccain is correct in what he said and that there is no equivalence to what obama said though moore actually likes what obama said shocka and thinks it was dead on _meta_end_dot_

 and there is the problem _meta_end_dot_

 so many on the left think obama was right following along with the small town hicks are gun nuts religious zealots immigrant haters and just total rubes memba this _meta_end_question_

 via an earlier post by beth c _meta_end_dot_

 at mccain blogs obama is the perfect candidate for the far far far left progressives _meta_end_dot_

 an elitist snob with all the connotations that that implies _meta_end_dot_

 combine that with obama being a federal level political neophyte who has really done zip in his few years other then vote present and we have the makings of another republicans stole the election come november _meta_end_dot_

 meanwhile the goracle and jimmy meet with hamas carter are apparently being poised to tell hillary that it is over _meta_end_dot_

 bring on the snob with the separatist and racially devise pastor of _meta_number_ref_ years _meta_end_exclamation_

 ps anyone think this meme is going to end up in the ny times monday _meta_end_question_

 crossed at pirate s cove and mccain blogs _meta_end_dot_
