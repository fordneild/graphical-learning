  apparently hospitals will now be required to let deranged patients go berserk until they tire themselves out _meta_end_dot_

 maintaining order for the safety of the other patients would be a violation of maniacs rights _meta_end_dot_

 from minnesota when the emergency room staff at northfield city hospital thought an obviously disturbed patient was about to turn violent they did what many hospitals do in that situation they called the police _meta_end_dot_

 in this instance officers used a taser to shock the man _meta_end_dot_

 the patient dropped to the floor was injected with medications and transferred to the psychiatric unit at another hospital according to an official report about the february incident _meta_end_dot_

 now federal and state health officials have cited the northfield hospital for violating the patient s rights _meta_end_dot_

 once again we see that anyone who takes money from the government is at the mercy of the government the minnesota department of health which investigated the incident cited the hospital for failing to protect the patient s safety _meta_end_dot_

 under federal law the hospital could lose medicare funding if the problem isn t corrected _meta_end_dot_

 staff had of course tried to calm the maniac down using verbal deescalation but when he became more and more agitated they made the mistake of placing the safety of all the normal people in the hospital above the minority privilege that entitles psychos to behave as they please _meta_end_dot_

 maniacs rights could be the next big movement no doubt culminating in a presidential candidate who has no other qualifications other than being a maniac _meta_end_dot_
