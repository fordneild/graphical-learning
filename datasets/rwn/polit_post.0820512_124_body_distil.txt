  an evangelical very religious conservative friend of mine wrote and asked me what scared me about obama _meta_end_dot_

 well there s more than a few things _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 elitism barack obama thinks he s better than the average american _meta_end_dot_

 he believes that americans are stupid _meta_end_dot_

 therefore he will be justified in putting forth all sorts of policies that are good for us but that the people don t want _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 bad judgment he was wrong about the surge and can t admit it _meta_end_dot_

 he surrounds himself with people of questionable character _meta_end_dot_

 he repeatedly demonstrates faulty reasoning _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 increasing taxes the best way to control the populace is to take their money so they have fewer choices _meta_end_dot_

 he frames redistribution of wealth as a way to stick it to the rich man but the rich man is already paying the lion s share of taxes _meta_end_dot_

 the top _meta_percent_ref_ of earners pay _meta_percent_ref_ of taxes _meta_end_dot_

 the top _meta_percent_ref_ pay _meta_percent_ref_ these are the people who make over _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 that would be you _meta_end_dot_

 he knows this _meta_end_dot_

 he doesn t care _meta_end_dot_

 his plan will kill the economy and cripple businesses who hire the people he pretends to care so much about _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 ideology obama doesn t not believe in american superiority _meta_end_dot_

 he doesn t believe america is a country anyone would want to emulate _meta_end_dot_

 he believes america is a negative force for the world _meta_end_dot_

 like jimmy carter he will side with who he perceives as the underdog and america is the big world bully _meta_end_dot_

 he will never side with america _meta_end_dot_

 a person has to think about how this ideology will drive decisions about hostage situations or terrorist attacks etc _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 lack of core values does he have any _meta_end_question_

 besides hope and change he can believe in namely himself what does barack hold true _meta_end_question_

 even the left is admitting that obama is leaving behind the ideals he campaigned on during the primary _meta_end_dot_

 how can anyone believe what he says _meta_end_question_

 how will other world leaders believe a man who changes what he says depending on the audience _meta_end_dot_

 it will put america in harms way to have a president who isn t believed _meta_end_dot_

 history is the best guide here _meta_end_dot_

 remember jimmy carter _meta_end_dot_

 heck remember bill clinton _meta_end_dot_

 feel free to add to the list _meta_end_dot_
