  it has become a given that john mccain is going to run a wimpy campaign _meta_end_dot_

 sure he may try to rip the jugular vein out of any republican who crosses him but when he goes up against a democrat he turns into a care bear _meta_end_dot_

 i m not happy about that but i ve made peace with it _meta_end_dot_

 it s his style it seems to work pretty well for him and he isn t going to change it at this point anyway _meta_end_dot_

 so be it _meta_end_dot_

 however i m not happy to see that the rnc is actually complaining because jeremiah wright s own words are being used in an ad _meta_end_dot_

 this morning the north carolina republican party introduced a tv ad against sen _meta_end_dot_

 barack obama d ill using images and sound from his controversial former pastor rev _meta_end_dot_

 jeremiah wright _meta_end_dot_

 okay technically the ad is against democratic gubernatorial candidates but only nominally _meta_end_dot_

 it s clear purpose it to tag obama as extreme for _meta_number_ref_ years barack obama sat in his pew listening to his pastor the narrator says _meta_end_dot_

 cue rev _meta_end_dot_

 wright and his god d america sermon _meta_end_dot_

 the ad then mentions democratic candidates bev perdue and richard moore who have endorsed obama _meta_end_dot_

 i asked the campaign of sen _meta_end_dot_

 john mccain r ariz what they made of the ad _meta_end_dot_

 john mccain strongly rejects this ad and the type of politics that degrades our civics spokeswoman jill hazelbaker immediately responded _meta_end_dot_

 from the beginning of this process mccain has expressed his intent to run a respectful campaign based on the issues and we have repeatedly called for all parties to follow his lead within a few hours mccain had written a letter to the chair of the north carolina gop linda daves saying from the beginning of this election i have been committed to running a respectful campaign based upon an honest debate about the great issues confronting america today _meta_end_dot_

 i expect all state parties to do so as well _meta_end_dot_

 the television advertisement you are planning to air degrades our civics and distracts us from the very real differences we have with the democrats _meta_end_dot_

 in the strongest terms i implore you to not run this advertisement republican national committee spokesman danny diaz issued a statement condemning the ad as well _meta_end_dot_

 senator mccain has been very clear that he expects to run a respectful campaign based on the critical issues confronting the nation diaz said _meta_end_dot_

 the rnc has been in contact with the nc gop and communicated that we do not believe the ad is appropriate or helpful and have asked that they refrain from running it now take a look at this ad _meta_end_dot_

 it uses wright s own words and calls obama extreme for buddying up to him _meta_end_dot_

 what s even supposed to be wrong with it _meta_end_question_

 if republicans can t even quote obama or his spiritual mentor without it being declared out of bounds we might as well just go ahead and concede the election now _meta_end_dot_

 moreover since the mccain campaign and the rnc are being such weenies about this here s a suggestion take any money that you were going to give to the rnc and or mccain campaign this week and give it to the north carolina republican party instead so we can at least have somebody out there that s not too intimidated to fight against the democrats _meta_end_dot_
