  _meta_number_ref_ did the affair begin before hunter began working with the campaign _meta_end_question_

 if nothing was going on why did edwards pay a novice _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ to shoot a handful of videos for his campaign _meta_end_question_

 _meta_number_ref_ if edwards loyalist andrew young is really the father of rielle hunter s baby why did his wife consent to having hunter living under the same roof _meta_end_question_

 _meta_number_ref_ can anyone seriously believe that john edwards supporter fred baron was paying off rielle hunter without his knowledge _meta_end_question_

 _meta_number_ref_ did elizabeth edwards really know about the affair back in _meta_number_ref_ or is that just a cover story concocted after the fact _meta_end_question_

 if she did know about the affair why did she allow rielle to remain on with the campaign after finding out hunter had been copulating with her husband _meta_end_question_

 _meta_number_ref_ if john edwards didn t love rielle hunter the baby isn t his and the affair has been over since _meta_number_ref_ what was he doing meeting in a hotel with her _meta_end_question_

 _meta_number_ref_ why did rielle hunter decide not to take a paternity test when establishing who the baby daddy was could be worth an enormous sum in child support _meta_end_question_

 could it be because she was paid a considerable sum of money not to take a paternity test that would show he is the father _meta_end_question_

 furthermore if john edwards really believes the baby isn t his why isn t he demanding a paternity test to put the matter to bed once and for all _meta_end_question_

 ps i do have a working theory about why edwards came forward with an admission of the affair that opened up all these cans of worms _meta_end_dot_

 there s no way to know for sure whether it s right but it would explain what happened abc had the goods on edwards and was going to do a damaging piece on the affair _meta_end_dot_

 abc then came to edwards and gave him an opportunity to do an exclusive interview rather than breaking the story _meta_end_dot_

 edwards took that opportunity but felt compelled to lie about a number of things because elizabeth may not have known the whole truth _meta_end_dot_

 so he either had to go public with a story full of holes or admit to his wife that he was still cheating on her with the woman who d had his love child _meta_end_dot_
