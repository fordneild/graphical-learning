  tis the season to be wheezin so i thought it might be helpful to talk personal hygiene _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_percent_ref_ of men regularly don t wash their hands after using public restrooms _meta_end_dot_

 that is just plain vile _meta_end_dot_

 for information about how to get out of public restrooms clean read here _meta_end_dot_

 it s more challenging that you d think it might also be a good time to discuss how disease and stupid ideas are spread because they happen the same way _meta_end_dot_

 a way to raise brand awareness is called viral marketing _meta_end_dot_

 good ideas can spread especially on the web where word of mouth is everything _meta_end_dot_

 viral marketing assumes that influencers will pass along the idea _meta_end_dot_

 and they do in a limited way we bloggers like to think in a big way _meta_end_dot_

 but what causes more extensive spreading _meta_end_question_

 big groups of people who don t use personal hygiene using mathematical models of social networks columbia professor duncan watts looked at how behavior or information cascades among groups of people or what we think of as going viral he found that the people we think of as influencers trusted folks with friends in many different social spheres don t really influence many people beyond their immediate community _meta_end_dot_

 watts argues that a much more reliable way to spark trends is by going after a large group of easily influenced people even if they don t have as many friends _meta_end_dot_

 so people say the hollywood elite never wash their ideological hands _meta_end_dot_

 they swarm in like minded groups and whatever disease that s going around _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ was inside job soldiers are rapists global warming will kill us all etc gets spread to everyone _meta_end_dot_

 that s how three stupid anti war movies can come out and make nary a penny _meta_end_dot_

 a mental disease spread _meta_end_dot_

 it is also how a big groups of people can cling to ridiculous ideas _meta_end_dot_

 the public has been stressed for some time now _meta_end_dot_

 they are disillusioned by the press and the government and their trust in our leaders like the president is hammered away at non stop _meta_end_dot_

 the press gives the government almost super natural power and the populace believes it _meta_end_dot_

 this fragile ecosystem is ripe for exploitation _meta_end_dot_

 all sorts of ideas fall in when rational thought is pushed out _meta_end_dot_

 thus a poll revealing the majority of the u s _meta_end_dot_

 believes a _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ conspiracy _meta_end_dot_

 it s insane _meta_end_dot_

 it s unfathomable but i know far too many people who believe these theories _meta_end_dot_

 they look normal yet they carry a pernicious disease and spread it mostly because they don t have the critical thinking foundation necessary to navigate this post modern world _meta_end_dot_

 and it is scary _meta_end_dot_

 you can try to rationalize it as ann althouse does but it s scary oh no _meta_end_dot_

 what is to become of our democracy if people are so foolish _meta_end_question_

 grasping for hope i theorize that people don t actually go around thinking these things but being polled somehow lures them into agreeing with statements _meta_end_dot_

 i m not saying the poll wasn t done according to professional standards _meta_end_dot_

 i m just speculating that maybe when people hear a calm professional sounding voice state a proposition perhaps something that they haven t really thought about they fall into agreement _meta_end_dot_

 and yes i know it s pathetic that that s all i can come up with when i m grasping for hope the cure for the disease is prevention _meta_end_dot_

 rational thoughts like clean hands help halt these diseases _meta_end_dot_
