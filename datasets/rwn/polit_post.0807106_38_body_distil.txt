  i don t know anyone who is more self righteous or unforgiving than eliot spitzer _meta_end_dot_

 so he s going to have a hard time finding friends right now spitzer himself was very severe going after prostitution rings that had to do with white collar crimes _meta_end_dot_

 he was very hard nosed with his tactics _meta_end_dot_

 to leave himself open to blackmail putting himself and the state in a compromised position like that it s just awful peter king i held off on commenting on eliot spitzer last night because _meta_number_ref_ everybody else was already talking about it _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ because i was holding out hope that he d do the honorable thing and resign _meta_end_dot_

 nobody seems to do that anymore _meta_end_dot_

 bill clinton didn t resign _meta_end_dot_

 larry craig didn t resign _meta_end_dot_

 david vitter didn t resign _meta_end_dot_

 barney frank didn t resign _meta_end_dot_

 william jefferson didn t resign _meta_end_dot_

 people always whinge and complain about how corrupt politicians are and then when a sleazebag democrat like spitzer gets caught with his hand in the cookie jar everyone bends over backwards to make excuses for him _meta_end_dot_

 now i will grant you that you shouldn t have to have the ethics of a pastor to be a politician but what s wrong with holding politicians to a very minimal ethical standard _meta_end_question_

 yes nobody is perfect and you can conceivably be a decent public servant even if you re not a particularly moral person but i d suggest to you that we should stop treating the exceptions like the rule _meta_end_dot_

 a man like spitzer who will lie to his own wife and cheat on her certainly can t be trusted by the people in new york _meta_end_dot_

 if more people realized that and savagely criticized any politician republican or democrat who engaged in this sort of behavior we would end up with cleaner better government _meta_end_dot_

 ps i am still hopeful that spitzer will resign by the end of the week but you never know with these guys _meta_end_dot_
