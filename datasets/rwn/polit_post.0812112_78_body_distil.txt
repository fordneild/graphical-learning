  when american presidents get close to the end of their time in office and they need a legacy builder they often turn to the israeli crisis _meta_end_dot_

 why if they could just make peace between the israelis and palestinians they d go down in the history books _meta_end_exclamation_

 then the reality of the situation which is that there is no politically acceptable practical way to make any sort of real peace between the israelis and the palestinians intrudes and they start saying ridiculous things like this young palestinians are losing hope for an agreement with israel us secretary of state condoleezza rice told an american jewish audience tuesday _meta_end_dot_

 increasingly the palestinians who talk about a two state solution are my age rice _meta_number_ref_ said in a somber speech to the american jewish committee at its _meta_number_ref_nd annual meeting _meta_end_dot_

 set to leave early thursday for more meetings with various arab and israeli leaders after talks in london designed to raise more economic support for the palestinians rice called on israel to make difficult decisions to provide the palestinians with the dignity of statehood _meta_end_dot_

 in fact she said we have a chance to reach the basic contours of a settlement by the end of the year a scaling back of president george w _meta_end_dot_

 bush s initial hope for a peace treaty between israel and the palestinians before he leaves office _meta_end_dot_

 rice also poured cold water on any prospects that israel and syria could negotiate peace terms _meta_end_dot_

 rice said the bush administration had tried to interest syria in peacemaking with such moves as an invitation to a mideast conference last november in annapolis maryland _meta_end_dot_

 it is hard to see there is a syrian regime receptive to negotiations with israel at this point she said _meta_end_dot_

 and the administration would have no dealings with hamas or other palestinian extremists that war with israel and refuse to recognize the jewish state _meta_end_dot_

 either you are a political party or a terrorist group rice said _meta_end_dot_

 you cannot be both once again rice criticized former president jimmy carter for holding talks with hamas leaders _meta_end_dot_

 i don t see the point of trying to negotiate with people who are determined to destroy the foundation of peace she said _meta_end_dot_

 ok among other things _meta_number_ref_ if young palestinians are losing hope for an agreement with israel it s because there is no hope of a genuine peace in the foreseeable future government run palestinian schools brainwash the children into hating israel and the palestinians haven t had anyone in their government genuinely working towards a real peace for decades _meta_end_dot_

 nobody else has much hope for a genuine peace between the israelis and palestinians so why should the young palestinians be any different _meta_end_question_

 _meta_number_ref_ any peace agreement that doesn t include israel s neighbors like syria and iran is pointless because they re exporting weapons supplies and aid to the terrorists _meta_end_dot_

 in other words if there is going to be peace by hook or crook syria and iran have to be forced to get on board _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ additionally simultaneously saying that we shouldn t negotiate with hamas while talking about negotiating a peace agreement makes no sense because not only is hamas part of the government they re currently the strongest force in palestinian territories _meta_end_dot_

 if hamas doesn t want a lasting peace and clearly they don t then there isn t going to be peace _meta_end_dot_

 all this silliness from rice is particularly ironic given that george bush gave an outstanding speech back in _meta_number_ref_ laying down the conditions for palestinians statehood _meta_end_dot_

 in that speech bush said among other things my vision is two states living side by side in peace and security _meta_end_dot_

 there is simply no way to achieve that peace until all parties fight terror _meta_end_dot_

 peace requires a new and different palestinian leadership so that a palestinian state can be born _meta_end_dot_

 i call on the palestinian people to elect new leaders leaders not compromised by terror _meta_end_dot_

 i call upon them to build a practicing democracy based on tolerance and liberty _meta_end_dot_

 a palestinian state will never be created by terror _meta_end_dot_

 it will be built through reform _meta_end_dot_

 and reform must be more than cosmetic change or a veiled attempt to preserve the status quo _meta_end_dot_

 true reform will require entirely new political and economic institutions based on democracy market economics and action against terrorism _meta_end_dot_

 today palestinian authorities are encouraging not opposing terrorism _meta_end_dot_

 this is unacceptable _meta_end_dot_

 and the united states will not support the establishment of a palestinian state until its leaders engage in a sustained fight against the terrorists and dismantle their infrastructure _meta_end_dot_

 and as we move toward a peaceful solution arab states will be expected to build closer ties of diplomacy and commerce with israel leading to full normalization of relations between israel and the entire arab world _meta_end_dot_

 if you ll note the palestinians as per usual have made zero progress towards any of the requirements bush laid down for a palestinian state _meta_end_dot_

 therein lies the real problem the palestinians have no interest in living peacefully with israel _meta_end_dot_

 to the contrary their goals are nothing less than committing genocide and taking israeli land _meta_end_dot_

 history tells us that until that changes or alternately until the palestinians are slaughtered or transferred the fighting will continue no matter how many empty promises or worthless treaties are signed _meta_end_dot_
