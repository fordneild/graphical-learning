  there s a ridiculous myth that rinos in dc have been spinning about illegal immigration and it goes something like this hispanics vote almost entirely based on the illegal immigration issue and if republicans deliver an amnesty hispanics will be so grateful that the percentage of them voting republican will go from roughly _meta_percent_ref_ up to _meta_number_ref__meta_beep_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 so even if we allow _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ million mostly uneducated mostly hispanic illegal aliens from socialist countries to become americans and that leads to another _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ million or more of their relatives becoming u s _meta_end_dot_

 citizens through chain migration it ll still be a net gain for the gop because they ll be voting majority republican _meta_end_dot_

 laugh if you want but there are bubble republicans in d c _meta_end_dot_

 that believe this _meta_end_dot_

 if they didn t they certainly wouldn t be setting up a situation where the gop could be demographically overwhelmed to such an extent via illegal immigration that we d be forced to have a democrat lite agenda to keep ourselves from becoming a permanent minority party _meta_end_dot_

 on the other hand it s also worth noting that the democrats clearly believe that they re going to be the ones to benefit politically from turning illegals into american citizens _meta_end_dot_

 that s the driving force behind their push for an amnesty and their desire to keep the floodgates on our southern borders open _meta_end_dot_

 that brings us to john mccain s presidential campaign _meta_end_dot_

 no republican is more closely associated with amnesty than john mccain _meta_end_dot_

 he was so heavily tied to the comprehensive immigration bill that was stopped in the senate that many people called it the mccain kennedy bill _meta_end_dot_

 furthermore although he switched to a security first position so he d have a chance to win the gop primaries mccain still explicitly said that he intended to put illegals on a path to citizenship after the border was secured _meta_end_dot_

 since then mccain has flip flopped back and forth several times between his security then amnesty position and the amnesty we ll have border security i swear wink wink position aka comprehensive immigration reform but he clearly seems to be leaning towards the latter option _meta_end_dot_

 with that in mind if your highest priority is having open borders and amnesty you couldn t possibly do better than john mccain as a republican nominee _meta_end_dot_

 that s a fair statement right _meta_end_question_

 he has been the champion of that sort of legislation and his nod toward securing the border has been as close to the bare minimum as any republican candidate could possibly pull off in a presidential election these days _meta_end_dot_

 additionally barack obama is generally perceived as being a weak candidate with hispanics _meta_end_dot_

 so how is mccain doing with hispanics _meta_end_question_

 actually not so well _meta_end_dot_

 according to gallup obama is consistently beating mccain _meta_number_ref_ to _meta_number_ref_ with hispanic voters _meta_end_dot_

 gallup s latest poll which was released in july shows mccain only receiving _meta_percent_ref_ of the hispanic vote _meta_end_dot_

 so let s take a hard look at this situation mccain is the republican most closely associated with amnesty he s giving speeches to racist hispanic groups like la raza he s going on trips to mexico he s publicly pledging to allow illegals to become american citizens en masse and he s not getting _meta_percent_ref_ of the hispanic vote or _meta_percent_ref_ or even _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 no mccain is only getting _meta_percent_ref_ of the hispanic vote and at an enormous cost _meta_end_dot_

 over the last few years no issue has done more damage to conservative enthusiasm and gop fundraising than illegal immigration and even though the dream candidate of the amnesty and open borders crowd is running the payoff so far has been drumroll please _meta_percent_ref_ of the hispanic vote against a democrat who is weak with hispanics _meta_end_dot_

 in other words the gop may very well attract higher percentages of hispanic voters in future elections although it s impossible to say whether the gop will ultimately be able to pull in _meta_percent_ref_ or more of that voting block _meta_end_dot_

 however what this election is proving once and for all is that hispanics are not one issue voters who can be permanently bought off by the republican party for the price of an amnesty _meta_end_dot_

 since that s the case comprehensive immigration reform is nothing less than political suicide for the gop _meta_end_dot_

 it utterly demoralizes the conservative base doesn t draw large numbers of hispanic voters to the republican banner and over the long haul it would be likely to demographically destroy the conservative movement in the united states _meta_end_dot_
