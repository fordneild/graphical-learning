  since i am a capitalist who generally has no problem with letting liberals waste their money on ads at rwn i generally approve just about every ad that comes down the pike _meta_end_dot_

 however there have been several exceptions over the years _meta_end_dot_

 for example a few weeks back i declined a t shirt ad that pictured barack obama as a monkey _meta_end_dot_

 that was just over the line in my book _meta_end_dot_

 well i have now declined a _meta_number_ref_nd ad this year _meta_end_dot_

 it featured a pothead group running this ad now i could have simply done the same thing in this case that i did with the united nations i took the ad and then i mercilessly mocked the un on rwn _meta_end_dot_

 however i thought it was way over the top to put the wife of a presidential candidate on a wanted poster _meta_end_dot_

 moreover their message which is that alcohol is bad for you while marijuana is harmless is complete and utter bullsh t _meta_end_dot_

 sure there are plenty of people who have smoked marijuana had a good time and never suffered any ill effects from it _meta_end_dot_

 there are also plenty of people who got high and wrecked their cars got addicted to pot started on pot and later moved on to harder drugs or simply wasted a large part of their life sitting around high watching tv and eating cheetos _meta_end_dot_

 granted there are lots of people who have screwed their lives up because of alcohol too but the idea that we should make another potentially life destroying drug legal just because we already have one that s legal and too societally entrenched to get rid of is nuts and it s not something i am going to contribute to even if i m paid to do so _meta_end_dot_
