  over at the daily kos diarist shef makes the case for white guilt mixes it in with a hefty dose of anti americanism and perhaps most ironically uses it to try to make a case for obama while denying that he s doing so tracy jordan a character on _meta_number_ref_ rock played by tracy morgan convinces liz lemon tina fey that he can t read in order to get time off from the show _meta_end_dot_

 tina fey s character outraged says and i m paraphrasing white guilt should be used for good like over tipping or voting for barack obama _meta_end_dot_

 fey makes this point of course in jest but it highlights a certain kind of attack that s been made on senator obama his candidacy and his supporters _meta_end_dot_

 this charge is that he plays on white people s guilt and his supporters support him because they are feel guilty not because he deserves to be president _meta_end_dot_

 this scurrilous reasoning reared its ugly head in the abominable comments of geraldine ferraro and one s head would have to be in the sand not to see it elsewhere it s an undercurrent to the attacks on any number of policies designed to benefit minorities _meta_end_dot_

 back to barack _meta_end_dot_

 i am proud that democrats today have two potential nominees one very potential nominee _meta_end_dot_

 whatever _meta_end_dot_

 one is a woman _meta_end_dot_

 one is black _meta_end_dot_

 this in and of itself is inspiring beyond words _meta_end_dot_

 guilt is the natural and correct emotion to feel when as a white person hell as an american one is confronted by america s original sin _meta_end_dot_

 for i and all my white brethren are the recipients the beneficiaries of hegemonic system _meta_end_dot_

 my privilege america s privilege has been paid for through the blood and oppression of other peoples _meta_end_dot_

 this doesn t mean i ought to go flogging myself all the time shame _meta_end_dot_

 it does mean that i ought to be aware and work to change the system as it is now _meta_end_dot_

 it means i ought to try to solve the problems that still haunt those on whose backs this country was made great _meta_end_dot_

 when i call myself an american i don t get to cherry pick which parts of america s identity i bring along _meta_end_dot_

 for slavery is as much a part of america as the emancipation proclamation _meta_end_dot_

 japanese internment as much as the bill of rights _meta_end_dot_

 guantanamo bay as much as the berlin airlifts _meta_end_dot_

 so by calling myself american i give myself to a country that both enables some of the best opportunities for social change and justice in the world and requires deep guilt _meta_end_dot_

 so i ll take pride in my white guilt and keep both eyes open _meta_end_dot_

 i ll take pride in my guilt and help my party and my liberal brethren fight for a better america _meta_end_dot_

 i ll let someone else be america s apologist _meta_end_dot_

 vote for barack because you re white and feel guilty but pretend that s not what you re doing _meta_end_exclamation_

 the japanese internment balances out the bill of rights _meta_end_exclamation_

 apparently only white people in the country today benefit from our hegemonic system america has gotten where it is because of the blood and oppression of other peoples white americans should feel guilty for what things that have nothing to do with them _meta_end_question_

 standing up for america is being an apologist after reading this i can t say that i feel any white guilt but lots of contempt and a small measure of pity _meta_end_question_

 yes i m there _meta_end_dot_
