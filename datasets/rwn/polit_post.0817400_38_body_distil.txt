  if you haven t read this atlantiic article on the spike in crime in certain suburbs and how they correlate to the redistribution of poor people via section _meta_number_ref_ housing it s one of the most important articles i ve read in months _meta_end_dot_

 maybe years _meta_end_dot_

 if urban planners have decided that any given city s public housing projects breed crime and should be dismantled or demolished then it behooves them to figure out which members of the projects really want to escape the pathologies there and give them the training life skills and support network they need to achieve a transformation rather than simply depriving them of the only community they know _meta_end_dot_

 as for those who plan to continue living crime ridden dysfunctional lives or whose kids do we might want to at least warn the police where they are being relocated to so law enforcement officials can adapt and plan around the new patterns _meta_end_dot_

 otherwise we re simply busing adults believing that they will live according to middle class values if they live next door to white people just as black children were bound to learn more if they were sitting next to whilte students _meta_end_dot_

 it s the power of white skin superhuman i tell you _meta_end_dot_

 little miss attila _meta_end_dot_
