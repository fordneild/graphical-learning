  people like to pretend that there s no difference between the democratic and republican party once you get beyond ideological issues but that s simply not true _meta_end_dot_

 one of the biggest differences is that democrats lie a lot more _meta_end_dot_

 this is something that even their own supporters tacitly acknowledge although they won t publicly admit it _meta_end_dot_

 take iran _meta_end_dot_

 later today at _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ est i m supposed to do the warren olney show in order to talk about rudy giuliani s foreign policy _meta_end_dot_

 so i m talking to the producer of the show and he asks me if i think that rudy s foreign policy will be the same as george bush s policy on iran _meta_end_dot_

 well the truth is that george bush all the top tier republican candidates and all the top tier democratic candidates have the exact same position on iran _meta_end_dot_

 for example which candidate wrote this about iran on their website _meta_end_question_

 as i have long said and will continue to say u s _meta_end_dot_

 policy must be clear and unequivocal we cannot we should not we must not permit iran to build or acquire nuclear weapons _meta_end_dot_

 and in dealing with this threat as i ve also said for a long time no option can be taken off the table is that rudy giuliani _meta_end_question_

 fred thompson _meta_end_question_

 mitt romney _meta_end_question_

 no it s hillary clinton _meta_end_dot_

 so why is it that liberals who are steadfastly against using force to stop iran from acquiring nuclear weapons are terrified that bush or giuliani would bomb iran but don t seem concerned that hillary barack or edwards would do the same _meta_end_question_

 simple they believe that the democratic candidates are lying for political reasons and that if it comes right down to it they ll let iran have nukes instead of using force _meta_end_dot_
