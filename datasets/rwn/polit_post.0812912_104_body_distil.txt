  if you want to know why barack obama didn t hold his hand over his heart while the national anthem was playing or why he made such a big deal out of not wearing a flag pin it was so he could appeal to the sort of people who read the daily kos _meta_end_dot_

 is that a stretch _meta_end_question_

 well read this excerpt from a post by daily kos diarist tsukasa buddha am i supposed to love america _meta_end_question_

 i mean i think it is rather silly when politicians say it is the greatest country in the world _meta_end_dot_

 now of course i realize that politicians are merely engaging in fluffy feel good hyperbole but it is just a pet peeve of mine _meta_end_dot_

 but i don t understand how you are expected to love your country _meta_end_dot_

 it really just doesn t make any sense to me it is like dividing by zero _meta_end_dot_

 patriotism also seems largely irrational to me _meta_end_dot_

 i am not quite sure why it would be a bad thing that a person did not love america or was not proud of it of course pride is another matter entirely but i disagree with it in general _meta_end_dot_

 and then there is the whole sharing american values that both sides use which i just completely don t get _meta_end_dot_

 is that a common sentiment at the daily kos _meta_end_question_

 indeed it is and there s a poll up at the daily kos that confirms it _meta_end_dot_

 there aren t a lot of responses yet but so far _meta_percent_ref_ of the kossacks when asked do you love america if not american use your own country say either i am annoyed by america but i ll stick with it or i want to plan to pack my bags and leave my friend there is a reason why liberals get accused of being unpatriotic it s because so many of them are unpatriotic _meta_end_dot_

 there s also a reason why conservatives are generally considered to be more patriotic than liberals it s because we are _meta_end_dot_
