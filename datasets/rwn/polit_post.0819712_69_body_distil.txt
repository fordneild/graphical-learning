  you want to know what s funny _meta_end_question_

 a bunch of faux objective liberals who are dying to see obama win the election trying to claim that they re not making fun of him because there s just nothing worth mocking about the guy _meta_end_dot_

 the new york times actually did an entire piece on this ridiculous subject and it s riddled with this sort of commentary comedy has been no easier for the phalanx of late night television hosts who depend on skewering political leaders for a healthy quotient of their nightly monologues _meta_end_dot_

 jay leno david letterman conan o brien and others have delivered a nightly stream of jokes about the republican running for president each one a variant on the same theme john mccain is old _meta_end_dot_

 but there has been little humor about mr _meta_end_dot_

 obama about his age his speaking ability his intelligence his family his physique _meta_end_dot_

 and within a late night landscape dominated by white hosts white writers and overwhelmingly white audiences there has been almost none about his race _meta_end_dot_

 we re doing jokes about people in his orbit not really about him said mike sweeney the head writer for mr _meta_end_dot_

 o brien on late night the jokes will come representatives of the late night shows said when mr _meta_end_dot_

 obama does or says something that defines him in comedy terms _meta_end_dot_

 we re carrion birds said jon stewart host of the daily show on the comedy central channel _meta_end_dot_

 we re sitting up there saying does he seem weak _meta_end_question_

 is he dehydrated yet _meta_end_question_

 let s attack but so far no true punch lines have landed _meta_end_dot_

 why _meta_end_question_

 the reason cited by most of those involved in the shows is that a fundamental factor is so far missing in mr _meta_end_dot_

 obama there is no comedic take on him nothing easy to turn to for an easy laugh like allegations of bill clinton s womanizing or president bush s goofy bumbling or al gore s robotic persona _meta_end_dot_

 the thing is he s not buffoonish in any way said mike barry who started writing political jokes for johnny carson s monologues in the waning days of the johnson administration and has lambasted every presidential candidate since most recently for mr _meta_end_dot_

 letterman _meta_end_dot_

 he s not a comical figure mr _meta_end_dot_

 barry said _meta_end_dot_

 obama is pacifistic green dumb as a box of rocks has terrible judgment is incredibly pompous regularly tosses people who displease him under the bus and flip flops on his positions depending on whom he s talking to while simultaneously leading millions of liberal zombies around by the nose just by talking about change and hope if you wrote a movie parody about the race for the presidency you couldn t come up with a template for a character who could inspire more jokes than barack obama _meta_end_dot_

 yet they can t think of anything funny to say about the guy _meta_end_question_

 why don t they just come right out and say that they re liberal and don t want to make fun of him because they want him to win in november _meta_end_question_

 you could at least respect that kind of honesty as opposed to this sort of gee we re right down the middle but we can t think of anything horsecrap that even other liberals can t be brainless enough to believe _meta_end_dot_

 update _meta_number_ref_ i was trying to come up with a better way to illustrate how easy it should be for these comedians to do material on obama aside from pointing to humor pieces on rwn and in other places making fun of him and it came to me in a flash _meta_end_dot_

 obama is this guy that s right we have the black version of frank burns running for president and there are people saying they can t figure out a way to make fun of him _meta_end_dot_
