  i sometimes wonder in fact i often wonder about the real mental acuity of the speaker of the house _meta_end_dot_

 she does not impress me as the brightest bulb in the pack the speaker blames what she labels the bush cheney big oil agenda using graphics to point out gasoline prices have more than doubled in the bush administration _meta_end_dot_

 this is a scam of the greatest magnitude says speaker pelosi _meta_end_dot_

 you have to remember that when ms _meta_end_dot_

 pelosi and the gang were running for reelection in _meta_number_ref_ they promised that if the people would give them a majority they d take care of gas prices _meta_end_dot_

 standing in front of a gas station with posted prices in the _meta_dollor_ref_ range she and the others implied it was as simple as that _meta_end_dot_

 they had a common sense plan remember _meta_end_question_

 now with gas prices over the _meta_dollor_ref_ mark about all the democrats seem capable of doing is attempting to blame bush _meta_end_dot_

 and don t even talk about increasing domestic production you know full well if you could drill in the arctic refuge it would save two cents _meta_number_ref_ years from now says speaker pelosi _meta_end_dot_

 ah goal post shifting or just the usual hyperbole you decide now it s _meta_number_ref_ years instead of _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 of course unsaid is the point that drilling elsewhere coupled with anwr would yield much more than two cents on down the road wouldn t it _meta_end_question_

 as for pelosi s common sense plan well it appears to be a two pronged attack _meta_end_dot_

 the first part of her solution then is mr _meta_end_dot_

 president do not fill the strategic petroleum reserve with oil at record highs _meta_end_dot_

 instead take out the oil that we brought at a lower price to bring down the price of oil to reduce the price at the pump says speaker pelosi _meta_end_dot_

 right _meta_end_dot_

 instead of drilling ms _meta_end_dot_

 pelosi would instead like to see us without a spr in a time in which we import _meta_percent_ref_ of our oil and are subject to interruption or cut off at any time _meta_end_dot_

 brilliant _meta_end_dot_

 and what would pushing this oil onto the market do for the price of gas not that much _meta_end_dot_

 maybe a few cents per gallon _meta_end_dot_

 but i mentioned a two pronged attack by the speaker didn t i _meta_end_question_

 well here s the second building on last month s bipartisan legislation passed overwhelmingly by the house requiring the commodities futures trading commission to use its emergency powers to curb excessive speculation distorting the energy markets the house agriculture committee this week will hold three days of hearings on oil market speculation _meta_end_dot_

 the goal is to present the house with strong legislation this month to bring transparency to the markets and to end speculators ability to artificially inflate the price at the pump _meta_end_dot_

 the house ag committee is holding three days of hearings on oil speculation _meta_end_question_

 brilliant _meta_end_exclamation_

 i m sure the folks at the london futures market and other foreign venues are shivering in their boots _meta_end_dot_

 and of course i m sure the faux problem of speculators will somehow be laid at bush s feet as well _meta_end_dot_

 so there you have nancy pelosi s solution to our gas price woes _meta_end_dot_

 don t drill in anwr or anywhere else deplete the strategic petroleum reserve a brilliant national security strategy and go after speculators with ag committee hearings _meta_end_dot_

 wooo hooo we ll be down to _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ a gallon in no time _meta_end_dot_

 if nancy pelosi and harry reid aren t the greatest arguments against seniority as the primary qualification for a leadership position i don t know who would be _meta_end_dot_
