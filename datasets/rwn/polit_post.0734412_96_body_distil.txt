  this story from the washington post clearly proves how today s objections to waterboarding particularly from congressional democrats is purely political grandstanding _meta_end_dot_

 when briefed on the interrogation techniques used against captured terrorists the reaction from those in the room was not just approval but encouragement even current house speaker nancy pelosi was there and did not raise objections at the time in september _meta_number_ref_ four members of congress met in secret for a first look at a unique cia program designed to wring vital information from reticent terrorism suspects in u s _meta_end_dot_

 custody _meta_end_dot_

 for more than an hour the bipartisan group which included current house speaker nancy pelosi d calif was given a virtual tour of the cia s overseas detention sites and the harsh techniques interrogators had devised to try to make their prisoners talk _meta_end_dot_

 among the techniques described said two officials present was waterboarding a practice that years later would be condemned as torture by democrats and some republicans on capitol hill _meta_end_dot_

 but on that day no objections were raised _meta_end_dot_

 instead at least two lawmakers in the room asked the cia to push harder two u s _meta_end_dot_

 officials said _meta_end_dot_

 the briefer was specifically asked if the methods were tough enough said a u s _meta_end_dot_

 official who witnessed the exchange _meta_end_dot_

 with one known exception no formal objections were raised by the lawmakers briefed about the harsh methods during the two years in which waterboarding was employed from _meta_number_ref_ to _meta_number_ref_ said democrats and republicans with direct knowledge of the matter _meta_end_dot_

 the lawmakers who held oversight roles during the period included pelosi and rep _meta_end_dot_

 jane harman d calif and sens _meta_end_dot_

 bob graham d fla and john d _meta_end_dot_

 rockefeller iv d w va as well as rep _meta_end_dot_

 porter j _meta_end_dot_

 goss r fla and sen _meta_end_dot_

 pat roberts r kan _meta_end_dot_

 individual lawmakers recollections of the early briefings varied dramatically but officials present during the meetings described the reaction as mostly quiet acquiescence if not outright support _meta_end_dot_

 among those being briefed there was a pretty full understanding of what the cia was doing said goss who chaired the house intelligence committee from _meta_number_ref_ to _meta_number_ref_ and then served as cia director from _meta_number_ref_ to _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 and the reaction in the room was not just approval but encouragement and where does this newfound disapproval come from _meta_end_question_

 the answer is obvious and i ve been saying it for a long time _meta_end_dot_

 democrats have forgotten _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ and the lessons they should have learned from it _meta_end_dot_

 in fairness the environment was different then because we were closer to sept _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ and people were still in a panic said one u s _meta_end_dot_

 official present during the early briefings _meta_end_dot_

 but there was no objecting no hand wringing _meta_end_dot_

 the attitude was we don t care what you do to those guys as long as you get the information you need to protect the american people only after information about the practice began to leak in news accounts in _meta_number_ref_ by which time the cia had already abandoned waterboarding did doubts about its legality among individual lawmakers evolve into more widespread dissent _meta_end_dot_

 the opposition reached a boiling point this past october when democratic lawmakers condemned the practice during michael b _meta_end_dot_

 mukasey s confirmation hearings for attorney general _meta_end_dot_

 this article also proves that republican lawmakers were speaking truthfully when they said members of congress had been fully briefed on the interrogation methods used against captured and suspected terrorists _meta_end_dot_

 opposition to the practice makes for good political theatre when trying to make a spectacle of mukasy s confirmation hearings or what is bound to happen over the issue of the destroyed cia interrogation tapes _meta_end_dot_

 the bottom line is this democrats knew about waterboarding and supported it _meta_end_dot_

 their opposition to it today comes from their desire to further politicize the war on terror and undermine our national security _meta_end_dot_
