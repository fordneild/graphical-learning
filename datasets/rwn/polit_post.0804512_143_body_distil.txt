  over at the huffpo they ve got a great new idea to help us sustain mother earth eat bugs _meta_end_dot_

 from kerry trueman we americans have a bias against eating bugs well most of us do anyway _meta_end_dot_

 just try serving your family a batch of homemade granola laced with pantry moth larvae i did and it totally grossed them out _meta_end_dot_

 once these miniscule maggots gatecrashed my granola i tried to make the best of it and defended my locally grown larvae as a good source of protein along with the almonds pecans and walnuts _meta_end_dot_

 my niece didn t swallow it too busy gagging i guess is it time to start chowing down on some of those crawly critters we instinctively prefer to stomp on _meta_end_question_

 the feral forager a self published zine excerpted in sandor katz s the revolution will not be microwaved rebrands pill bugs as land shrimp grasshoppers are surprisingly tasty and filling and taste something like popcorn crickets incredibly high in calcium and potassium roasted grubs make a fat filled protein snack that again tastes a lot like popcorn earthworms make a very nutritious flour and ant eggs are edible too raw ant eggs reportedly taste like couscous but the author of the article confesses that the only time i tried this it tasted like a hundred ants biting my tongue but the feral foragers don t draw the line at eating insects some of them go so far as to cross the yellow line in their pursuit of alternative food sources _meta_end_dot_

 as members of a north carolina collective called wildroots they re what katz calls roadkill radicals enthusiastic advocates of peeling dishonored victims of the petroleum age off the pavement and converting them into food which nourishes as the feral forger notes picking up roadkill is a good way to get fresh wild totally free range and organic meat for absolutely free finally a silver lining to our car crazed culture _meta_end_dot_

 if the thought of eating bugs and roadkill freaks you out consider this competition for the world s dwindling resources is heating up right along with the planet and global warming is worsening food shortages all over the world _meta_end_dot_

 in this land o plenty o processed foods most americans can t imagine an era when we d be forced to subsist on weeds bugs and till we run out of gas roadkill _meta_end_dot_

 as a country boy i ve eaten more than a few out of the ordinary foods in my life gator snake rabbit turtle deer bear so i m not horrified by the idea of trying unusual foods _meta_end_dot_

 but roadkill moth larvae and earthworms _meta_end_question_

 that s just gross _meta_end_dot_

 i mean if someone says that they want to eat weeds and ant eggs well more power to them but there s a reason most people prefer steaks and chicken _meta_end_dot_

 moreover i seriously doubt people in america will ever be forced to subsist on weeds bugs and till we run out of gas roadkill unless some sort of cataclysmic disaster happens _meta_end_dot_

 you know asteroid strike nuclear war global plague zombies eating everybody something like that _meta_end_dot_

 but even if there ever are malthusian worsening food shortages in the world you can be pretty sure given how good our farmers are that we ll be about the last people left on earth to run out of food and quite frankly the tiny amount of global warming we ve had or are going to have isn t going to change that _meta_end_dot_
