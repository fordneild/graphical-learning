 this is the plan of all the insurance companies that are owned by mormon interests _meta_end_dot_

 it is unfolding as the mormon church planned over the last fifty years roseanne barr _meta_number_ref_ news of killings is not good for us but it also keeps the new orleans brand out there and it keeps people thinking about our needs and what we need to bring this community back democratic mayor of new orleans ray nagin explains the upside of murders in his city _meta_number_ref_ let s face it if the mothers ruled the world there would be no godd mned wars in the first place sally field _meta_number_ref_ perhaps the outpouring of sympathy for the falsely arrested duke lacrosse players reade seligman collin finnerty and david evans is just a bit misplaced as students of duke university or other elite institutions these young men will get on with their privileged lives they are very differently situated in life from say the young women of the rutgers university women s basketball team nightline co anchor terry moran explains how the men falsely accused of rape got off light compared to the women who were called nappy headed hos _meta_number_ref_ i do believe that it s the first time in history that fire has ever melted steel _meta_end_dot_

 it is physically impossible rosie o donnell talks trutherism _meta_number_ref_ and i think the almost undeviating support by great britain for the ill advised policies of president bush in iraq have been a major tragedy for the world jimmy carter castigates the british for cooperating with his own country _meta_number_ref_ i don t know what it s going to take for people to really wake up and understand that they the bush administration are liars and they are murderers joy behar from the view _meta_number_ref_ some people just don t like mexicans or anyone else from south of the border _meta_end_dot_

 they think latinos are freeloaders and welfare cheats who are too lazy to learn english _meta_end_dot_

 they think latinos have too many babies and that latino kids will dumb down our schools _meta_end_dot_

 they think latinos are dirty diseased indolent and more prone to criminal behavior _meta_end_dot_

 they think latinos are just too different from us ever to become real americans _meta_end_dot_

 no amount of hard empirical evidence to the contrary and no amount of reasoned argument or appeals to decency and fairness will convince this small group of americans fewer than _meta_number_ref_ percent of the general population at most otherwise _meta_end_dot_

 unfortunately among this group is a fair number of republican members of congress almost all influential conservative talk radio hosts some cable news anchors most prominently lou dobbs and a handful of public policy experts at organizations such as the center for immigration studies the federation for american immigration reform numbersusa in addition to fringe groups like the minuteman project _meta_end_dot_

 stripped bare this is what the current debate on immigration reform is all about linda chavez _meta_number_ref_ well because the arabs who were involved in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ cooperated with the zionists actually _meta_end_dot_

 it was a cooperation _meta_end_dot_

 they gave them the perfect excuse to denounce all arabs _meta_end_dot_

 the longer we stand idly by while they do so the more we resemble those good germans who professed ignorance of their own gestapo frank rich _meta_number_ref_ that we have collectively failed to halt and repudiate the war in iraq makes us even worse than the germans scott ritter _meta_number_ref_ i propose a limitation be put on how many sqares sic of toilet paper can be used in any one sitting _meta_end_dot_

 now i don t want to rob any law abiding american of his or her god given rights but i think we are an industrious enough people that we can make it work with only one square per restroom visit except of course on those pesky occasions where _meta_number_ref_ to _meta_number_ref_ could be required sheryl crow at the huffington post _meta_number_ref_ now i believe myself that the secretary of state the secretary of defense and you have to make your own decision as to what the president knows that this war is lost that the surge is not accomplishing anything democratic senator majority leader harry reid _meta_number_ref_ i used to have violence fantasies about scott mcclellan because of the inpenetrable wall of idiocy and supposed ignorance some of which was probably not supposed that behind which he used to hide at every press conference _meta_end_dot_

 all those feelings are being shifted now to dana perino violence fantasies liberal radio host mike malloy _meta_number_ref_ al qaeda really hurt us but not as much as rupert murdoch has hurt us particularly in the case of fox news _meta_end_dot_

 fox news is worse than al qaeda worse for our society _meta_end_dot_

 it s as dangerous as the ku klux klan ever was msnbc s keith olbermann _meta_number_ref_ america needs to follow the policies it has introduced in germany _meta_end_dot_

 we have to go through a certain de nazification process george soros _meta_number_ref_ impeach the president and the vice president they are traitors to america and so are all of their supporters _meta_end_dot_

 i m not kidding here democratic congressman dennis kucinich _meta_number_ref_ i have zero doubt that if dick cheney was not in power people wouldn t be dying needlessly tomorrow i m just saying if he did die other people more people would live _meta_end_dot_

 that s a fact bill maher _meta_number_ref_ drudge _meta_end_question_

 aw drudge somebody ought to wrap a strong republican entrail around his neck and hoist him up about six feet in the air and watch him bounce liberal radio host mike malloy _meta_number_ref_ it s good michelle malkin s in d c _meta_end_dot_

 i don t wish anyone harm even tony snow _meta_end_dot_

 and i do hope he recovers or at least does what he feels is best and surrounds himself with friends and family for his journey _meta_end_dot_

 not of his presidency _meta_end_dot_

 but of his military role as commander in chief to be crystal clear i am not advocating or inciting you to undertake any illegal act insurrection mutiny putsch or military coup _meta_end_dot_

 in addition to relieving him of his command as commander in chief you also have authority to place the president under military arrest martin lewis at the huffington post _meta_number_ref_ a friend of ours said if the same laws were applied to u s _meta_end_dot_
