  the founding fathers in their wisdom devised a method by which our republic can take one hundred of its most prominent numbskulls and keep them out of the private sector where they might do actual harm p j _meta_end_dot_

 o rourke if you need proof that p j _meta_end_dot_

 o rourke was right just read some of the quips and quotes from the democrats in the senate that have been questioning petraeus and crocker _meta_end_dot_

 they re oblivious to the incredible progress that has been made in iraq since the surge started give zero credence to anything said by the guy running the war and every question is calculated purely for political gain with zero concern for winning the war or for their country _meta_end_dot_

 in all honesty this is not hyperbole i mean every word of this i m not sure who s more desperate to see america humiliated and defeated in iraq al qaeda or the democrats in the senate _meta_end_dot_

 and i gotta tell you the moronic liberal bloggers covering this aren t much better _meta_end_dot_

 for example take a look at this there was once a blog called joe biden is thugged out _meta_end_dot_

 i swear this is true biden just proved why _meta_end_dot_

 he asked ryan crocker who used to be ambassador to pakistan whether it would be better for u s _meta_end_dot_

 interests to go after al qaeda on the afghanistan pakistan border or al qaeda in iraq _meta_end_dot_

 crocker in an impossible political position give the correct answer and humiliate the bush administration give the administration s answer and look like a fool dodged as much as he could _meta_end_dot_

 then biden forced him down _meta_end_dot_

 crocker i would therefore pick al qaeda on the afghanistan pakistan border so if we had to make a choice between going after al qaeda in afghanistan or iraq it would be better to go after them in afghanistan _meta_end_dot_

 wow game over man _meta_end_exclamation_

 how humiliating for the bush administration _meta_end_exclamation_

 we might as well pack it in and go home in iraq and oh wait we don t have to choose between those two options do we _meta_end_question_

 moreover i note that crocker isn t suggesting that we forget about iraq and concentrate all of our efforts in afghanistan _meta_end_dot_

 he thinks we should do both yet there are liberal bloggers getting all excited over this _meta_end_dot_

 hey here s a comparable question what if we had to choose between having half the united states destroyed by an asteroid or between having john mccain beat barack obama in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_question_

 so having mccain in would be better _meta_end_question_

 oh how humiliating for the left _meta_end_exclamation_

 obama should just forget about his campaign right now _meta_end_exclamation_

 mccain is all thugged out _meta_end_exclamation_

 w_meta_number_ref_t ugh idiots _meta_end_dot_
