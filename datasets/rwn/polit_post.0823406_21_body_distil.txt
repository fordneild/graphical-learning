  media matters is pitching this commentary from rush limbaugh as if it s supposed to be terribly controversial to someone besides liberals rush limbaugh said that it is striking how unqualified sen _meta_end_dot_

 barack obama is and and how this whole thing came about with within the democrat party _meta_end_dot_

 i think it really goes back to the fact that nobody had the guts to stand up and say no to a black guy limbaugh went on to say i think this is a classic illustration here where affirmative action has reared its ugly head against them _meta_end_dot_

 if barack obama becomes president of the united states he will be the first affirmative action president because there s very little in his background that shows he s ready for the job and if he gets it it ll be because more qualified applicants were passed over because of their skin color _meta_end_dot_

 despite being unqualified to be president obama won the democratic nomination because black democrats voted for him because he was black and a lot of white liberals voted for him either out of white guilt or because they were afraid of being labeled as racists if they went for hillary _meta_end_dot_

 if democrats were honest they d admit that barack obama probably wouldn t merit a cabinet appointment in a hillary clinton administration if he were a white guy _meta_end_dot_

 maybe _meta_number_ref_ years ago in this country people might have been too terrified of being called racists to point out the truth about barack obama _meta_end_dot_

 but today in a time when the word racist means threatening to the interests of the democratic party or jesse jackson or al sharpton need some more money about _meta_percent_ref_ of the time it s a lot harder to intimidate people into pretending the emperor is wearing a full set of clothes _meta_end_dot_
