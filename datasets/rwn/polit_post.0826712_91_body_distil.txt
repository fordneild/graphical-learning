  when you re running a presidential campaign you hit your opponent s weaknesses respond to attacks etc etc but you always need to keep a central narrative in mind _meta_end_dot_

 what is that core message you want voters to keep in mind about you and your opponent when they step into the voting booth _meta_end_question_

 for mccain prior to selecting sarah palin it was mccain is an experienced leader who puts country first above party _meta_end_dot_

 obama on the other hand is a complete novice who has gotten to where he is by being more of a celebrity than a politician a shorter version would be mccain experienced country first _meta_end_dot_

 obama clueless celebrity since then mccain has gotten away from the experience message and as a consequence the campaign has started to slip in the polls despite the fact that sarah palin has added a lot of excitement to the ticket _meta_end_dot_

 this bailout crisis plays into this theme perfectly but the mccain campaign for reasons that escape me has completely bungled their response to it _meta_end_dot_

 their longer message should be something akin to this back in _meta_number_ref_ john mccain was experienced enough to try to fix this issue while novices like barack obama didn t even realize there was a problem _meta_end_dot_

 if they had listened to john mccain back then it would have saved the taxpayers hundreds of billions of dollars _meta_end_dot_

 so since this crisis has the potential to affect everyone in the country including you your family and your children and it is going to stretch into the next administration whom do you want dealing with it _meta_end_question_

 a guy like mccain who has seen it all and done it all or a wet behind the ears rookie like obama who has been getting advice from the guys at fannie mae who were partially responsible for the problem in the first place _meta_end_question_

 their shorter message should be more like this you can t vote present in a crisis so when a big decision that affects the financial future of you and your children comes up do you trust john mccain or barack obama to deal with it if people are thinking the next president is going to have to make some big decisions _meta_end_dot_

 whom do i trust to handle it on november _meta_number_ref_th then barack obama is going to lose _meta_end_dot_

 but time is short and the race is close so the mccain campaign cannot afford to keep up the undisciplined display we ve seen from them since the gop convention _meta_end_dot_
