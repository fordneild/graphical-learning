  from my email john if at some point soon you determine that fred doesn t have a shot to win the nomination would you put your support behind another candidate _meta_end_question_

 if so who _meta_end_question_

 i would have guessed huckabee until yesterday when you made those reminds you of jimmy carter comments _meta_end_dot_

 also as a christian i support thompson because i feel he s the most conservative candidate but so many other christians that i know support huckabee probably just because he s a former preacher _meta_end_dot_

 is this a big mistake or a problem for the gop _meta_end_question_

 aaron braun duin here s how it breaks down for me _meta_end_dot_

 the candidate i like the best is my former employer duncan hunter _meta_end_dot_

 however he s not doing so well at the polls _meta_end_dot_

 after him i m a fred thompson fan _meta_end_dot_

 why _meta_end_question_

 because thompson has the requisite charisma to win the nomination and beat hillary is a fiscal conservative favors small government is tough on illegal immigration and is pro life _meta_end_dot_

 he s also the only candidate in the top tier who i believe can rally conservatives to vote for him as opposed to simply voting against hillary and we desperately need someone like that in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 once you get past thompson there s an enormous gulf between him and the other _meta_number_ref_ contenders _meta_end_dot_

 out of the top tier contenders over time the guy i have really gotten down on is giuliani _meta_end_dot_

 i don t think he s anywhere near as electable as people think he s pro abortion he s not serious about dealing with illegal immigration he s not a conservative and he is way too sleazy to be representing the republican party _meta_end_dot_

 so him i really really don t want _meta_end_dot_

 after giuliani it s essentially a toss up for me between the other three top contenders _meta_end_dot_

 that s not to say that they re all alike because they re not but all of them have big drawbacks that keep me from being able to really strongly support them _meta_end_dot_

 mccain is a fiscal conservative he seems serious about winning the war on terror and he s currently polling better against hillary than any of the other candidates but he s also a little too long in the tooth to be running for president he will screw us over on illegal immigration and he has made a career out of selling conservatives down the river for the amusement of the mainstream media _meta_end_dot_

 mitt romney has charisma a pretty decent resume and he talks a good game about conservative issues but i think he s one of these politicians who tells people whatever they want to hear to get elected _meta_end_dot_

 also his head to head polling numbers against hillary and national numbers in the gop primaries are really anemic especially given all the positive press he has gotten over the last six months _meta_end_dot_

 that makes me think that he can t win a general election _meta_end_dot_

 huckabee has a great socially conservative resume and so much charisma that i think he d probably be able to beat hillary in a national election _meta_end_dot_

 however he probably wouldn t make conservatives happy on illegal immigration or fiscal conservative issues _meta_end_dot_

 in other words huckabee strikes me as george bush with charisma on domestic issues _meta_end_dot_

 that s not very appealing _meta_end_dot_

 with that in mind i really don t have a _meta_number_ref_rd choice after thompson and hunter _meta_end_dot_

 if neither of them can pull it off i m just planning to shrug my shoulders and resign myself to whoever manages to pull it off as long as it s not giuliani _meta_end_dot_

 if it comes down to a two person race between giuliani and another candidate in the primary i m supporting the other candidate _meta_end_dot_

 granted that may not be the ideal but such is life _meta_end_dot_

 sometimes you don t get what you want and you just have to make the best of a bad situation oh and personally i wouldn t have the slightest qualms about supporting any of those candidates including giuliani over hillary clinton _meta_end_dot_

 ps thompson is still in the race and if he can pull off a victory in south carolina where he has been in the top slot in a recent poll he has an excellent chance to win the nomination _meta_end_dot_
