  mackubin thomas owens had a great column yesterday in honor of veterans day _meta_end_dot_

 he noted the proclivity of those in the media to treat those in the military as either victims or monsters _meta_end_dot_

 he notes that since the vietnam war the storyline from the left about american military is that serving in an unjust war warped the consciences of the soldiers to the extent that they regularly committed atrocities _meta_end_dot_

 the narrative started in vietnam but now is being continued for the war in iraq _meta_end_dot_

 tnr gave the game away by admitting that the point of the series penned by beauchamp was to illustrate the morally and emotionally distorting effects of war in doing so tnr was reinforcing the left wing stereotype that has shaped popular opinion about soldiers since the vietnam war that they are dehumanized animals _meta_end_dot_

 according to the conventional wisdom passed down from the anti war left of the sixties and seventies and absorbed by the press even those too young to remember it vietnam brutalized those who fought it _meta_end_dot_

 at first vilified by the anti war left as war criminals and baby killers american soldiers soon evolved into victims victimized first by their country which made them poor and sent them off to fight an unjust war then victimized again by a military that dehumanized them and turned them into killers _meta_end_dot_

 beauchamp provided tnr that pre approved narrative facts be damned _meta_end_dot_

 this was vietnam redux _meta_end_dot_

 we remember well what critics of the vietnam war said about the troops _meta_end_dot_

 in his infamous _meta_number_ref_ testimony before the senate foreign relations committee john kerry said they had acted in a fashion reminiscent of genghis khan that they had raped cut off ears cut off heads and done worse to civilians in the ravaged south _meta_end_dot_

 kerry s organization and now in iraq the media chooses to focus more on stories substantiated or not of atrocities rather than heroism _meta_end_dot_

 would anyone have believed such a story about world war ii and the greatest generation of course not but many in the media have been willing to believe that u s _meta_end_dot_

 servicemen in vietnam were capable of any atrocity _meta_end_dot_

 this predisposition lives on today _meta_end_dot_

 here s our old friend john kerry last year on face the nation _meta_end_dot_

 american troops said kerry were going into the homes of iraqis in the dead of night terrorizing kids and children you know women breaking sort of the customs of the of of of historical customs religious customs _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 and who can forget the bilious rep _meta_end_dot_

 john murtha d penn a vociferous critic of the war who claimed that marines in haditha had killed innocent civilians in cold blood long before an investigation had been completed _meta_end_dot_

 murtha contended that the incident shows the tremendous pressure that these guys are under every day when they re out in combat murtha subsequently went further claiming that the shootings in haditha had been covered up _meta_end_dot_

 who covered it up why did they cover it up why did they wait so long _meta_end_question_

 we don t know how far it goes _meta_end_dot_

 it goes right up the chain of command as readers may know the haditha prosecutions have largely unraveled _meta_end_dot_

 in both vietnam and iraq news stories about soldiers have been largely negative _meta_end_dot_

 but heroism and sacrifice were far more prevalent in vietnam than atrocities and the same holds true today _meta_end_dot_

 the tnr beauchamp affair illustrates just how little things have changed since vietnam _meta_end_dot_

 in april of _meta_number_ref_ sgt _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_st class paul ray smith u s _meta_end_dot_

 army became the first soldier in the iraq war to be awarded the medal of honor _meta_end_dot_

 he was killed in action when his outnumbered unit was attacked by iraqi forces at the baghdad airport on april _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ and is credited with saving hundreds of lives _meta_end_dot_

 yet as robert kaplan observed in a piece in the wall street journal that according to lexisnexis by june _meta_number_ref_ two months after his posthumous award smith s stirring story had drawn only _meta_number_ref_ media mentions compared to _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ for the supposed quran abuse at guantanamo bay and _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ for the court martialed abu ghraib guard lynndie england _meta_end_dot_

 perhaps the problem is that those in the media don t personally know anyone fighting over in iraq so they re predisposed to believe their chosen narrative about the effect of fighting on americans psyche _meta_end_dot_

 as bing west has observed there will be no true glory for our soldiers in iraq until they are recognized not as victims but as aggressive warriors _meta_end_dot_

 stories of their bravery deserve to be recorded and read by the next generation _meta_end_dot_

 unsung the noblest deeds will die on this veterans day media folk predisposed to believe the worst about the american fighting man when the evidence is so clearly in his favor need to get out and meet a few more _meta_end_dot_

 our military are not victims brutalized into committing war crimes _meta_end_dot_

 the overwhelming majority are brave men and women honorably serving with courage and humanity _meta_end_dot_

 i wish that the american media would do more to recognize that _meta_end_dot_
