  maureen dowd via i p certainly bill wants to repay hill for those traumatic times when he had to hide behind her skirt _meta_end_dot_

 and certainly he feels that his legacy is tied to her _meta_end_dot_

 he suggests to matt bai in today s times magazine that she can be f d r _meta_end_dot_

 to his teddy roosevelt getting through the ideas that fell flat the first time _meta_end_dot_

 it s true that the first roosevelt was a progressive republican who had no problem with big government but he actually succeeded in getting most of his ideas enacted into law _meta_end_dot_

 perhaps the first time dowd means the period when teddy moved fairly far from his republican mandate was really the non time of his failed campaign onthe bull moose ticket roosevelt campaigned on a platform of new nationalism which included such reforms as women s suffrage old age pensions and child labor laws _meta_end_dot_

 he called for the continuation of trusts but under government supervision and advised their continued existence under government regulation _meta_end_dot_

 but analogizing from the case of teddy roosevelt s first time his progressive republican administration to the time that never was his abortive bull moose administration is the wrong analogy to the president clinton who was and the president clinton who would be _meta_end_dot_

 yet it s close in both cases we can learn from the example of a bored relatively young ex president willing to ride whatever will get him back in that ultimate driver s seat _meta_end_dot_

 cross posted at likelihood of success _meta_end_dot_
