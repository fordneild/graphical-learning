  cheri jacobus who is a brilliant woman a republican strategerist she lives in washington she s worked on capitol hill posted a little blurb just how much senate experience does barack obama have in terms of actual work days _meta_end_question_

 not much _meta_end_dot_

 how many days experience from the time he s inaugurated in the senate sworn in until he announced his presidential exploratory committee how many actual days of work experience in the senate for barack obama educated guess _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 it s _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 after _meta_number_ref_ days of work experience obama believed he was ready to be commander in chief leader of the free world and fill the shoes of abraham lincoln fdr jfk and ronald reagan _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ days i keep leftovers in my refrigerator longer than that _meta_end_dot_

 in contrast john mccain s _meta_number_ref_ years in congress _meta_number_ref_ years of military service including _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ days in captivity as a pow in hanoi now seem more impressive than ever so there you go _meta_number_ref_ days _meta_end_dot_

 so this is the key _meta_end_dot_

 all of these so called flip flops all these changes in position they are due to his inexperience _meta_end_dot_

 his inexperience and his incompetence lead him to make goofs to lie to flounder around rush limbaugh
