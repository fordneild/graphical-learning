  yesterday i read john hawkin s interview with the anonymous campaign staffer _meta_end_dot_

 the more i read the madder i got _meta_end_dot_

 at the end through im poor john got sprayed with my vented spleen _meta_end_dot_

 if that sounds horrible it was _meta_end_dot_

 he said wow you re in a bad mood actually no i m not _meta_end_dot_

 i m in a great mood _meta_end_dot_

 i m just fed up with the outrageous condescension emanating out of dc and republicans in particular _meta_end_dot_

 i hadn t read your comments and he suggested that i do _meta_end_dot_

 i love you guys _meta_end_exclamation_

 you re my peeps _meta_end_exclamation_

 you said what i felt but in a far more reasoned thoughtful way _meta_end_dot_

 later john got me back _meta_end_dot_

 the new york times dropped the piece about mccain s _meta_number_ref_ degree turn i can t say _meta_number_ref_ because he only changed to the security first mantra on amnesty _meta_end_dot_

 my ears are still burning from that _meta_end_dot_

 my reaction _meta_end_question_

 bemused _meta_end_dot_

 it s touching that someone actually believed john mccain _meta_end_dot_

 as i ve said before john mccain serves at the leisure of john mccain _meta_end_dot_

 we re all just along for the i know better than you ride _meta_end_dot_

 i think it s time we face the facts if we haven t already the next four years are going to f cking suck _meta_end_dot_

 last week kim dutoit said it best mccain is going to screw us every single chance he gets as long as what he does makes him popular with the press or with centrist democrats like joe lieberman or with moderate republicans like olympia snowe or with popular figures like ted kennedy and arianna huffington or with international bodies like the united nations _meta_end_dot_

 and occasionally he s going to screw us just because he hates conservatives and because he can and because he knows that as bad as he is obama would be orders of magnitude worse _meta_end_dot_

 linking to the post i said p s _meta_end_dot_

 have you noticed that i have a hillary tag and an obama tag but i just can t bring myself to make a mccain tag _meta_end_question_

 i just _meta_end_dot_

 can t _meta_end_dot_

 do _meta_end_dot_

 it _meta_end_dot_

 arghhhhhh _meta_end_exclamation_

 the next four years are going to be hell _meta_end_dot_

 tar and feathers will be a relief _meta_end_dot_

 illegal immigration security first enrages our southern neighbor mexico the world might hate us _meta_end_dot_

 there are millions new voters only if amnesty passes and the republicans lose them all if we re too strict on border fences translation i ll lose my power _meta_end_dot_

 we need a cheap work force workers as a commodity _meta_end_dot_

 earmarks pork you don t have to look into the eyes of big donors and tell them they aren t getting a government contract _meta_end_dot_

 the democrats do it and then locals won t support republicans _meta_end_dot_

 democrats do it _meta_end_dot_

 we re better than them _meta_end_dot_

 translation i ll lose my power iraq terrorism americans don t like it translation if i m too supportive of the effort i ll lose my power _meta_end_dot_

 no americans f cking hate losing _meta_end_dot_

 with a purple passion americans hate sh ting money away on a big pile of nothing _meta_end_dot_

 do what it frigging takes people _meta_end_dot_

 if that means obliterating sadr city from the face of the planet to get the squabbling morons to pay attention then do it and be done with it _meta_end_dot_

 war is bloody business _meta_end_dot_

 if it s a war worth fighting then f cking fight it _meta_end_dot_

 things look like they re going better _meta_end_dot_

 good _meta_end_dot_

 when we succeed pound away about it in the media and stop being pussies with the press _meta_end_dot_

 the press if i m nice they ll be kind translation i want to be re elected and the press can help me the press hates you _meta_end_dot_

 they are progressive leftists _meta_end_dot_

 why do you give flying flap jack what they think _meta_end_question_

 it is over if it ever was which it wasn t _meta_end_dot_

 you won t receive fairness from them _meta_end_dot_

 you won t receive balance _meta_end_dot_

 they will slant things take you out of context malign you degrade you _meta_end_dot_

 accept it _meta_end_dot_

 that s life _meta_end_dot_

 move along and do the right thing and don t try to change reality _meta_end_dot_

 democrats americans want us to work with them _meta_end_dot_

 translation democrats are our friends and we see them at parties and we want to be polite no they don t _meta_end_dot_

 your voters want you to stand on a principle _meta_end_dot_

 fight _meta_end_dot_

 the democrats will betray and sell you out every chance they get _meta_end_dot_

 they will be aided and abetted by the press _meta_end_dot_

 stop trying to be pals with the bullies _meta_end_dot_

 smash their faces metaphorically _meta_end_dot_

 global warming our planet might die and it s our fault _meta_end_dot_

 translation everyone believes it it must be true and we want to co opt the issue from democrats because we want to sound smart and oh by the way we want to be re elected shut the f ck up _meta_end_exclamation_

 you are going to kill the economy _meta_end_dot_

 people are also bitching about gas prices if you haven t noticed and it s because you idiots adopt stupid policies to appease special interests like environmentalists and farmers does anyone find these two groups an unholy alliance _meta_end_dot_

 global warming isn t caused by humans and even if it is you buffoons aren t going to solve it _meta_end_dot_

 you re politicians not frigging scientists _meta_end_dot_

 stop meddling in every damn thing _meta_end_dot_

 energy we need to lower gas prices let s ride the oil companies _meta_end_dot_

 translation blaming is easier than making hard political choices and i really really want to be re elected it s called drilling and exploration _meta_end_dot_

 free the capitalists to do their work before we end up like europe and paying _meta_dollor_ref_ a gallon of gas _meta_end_dot_

 i could go on and on _meta_end_dot_

 do you notice a theme _meta_end_question_

 instead of standing on principle the republicans rationalize their devilish deal making by saying well if we re not in office it will be far worse because democrats would do worse things and yes i remember reagan s quotes about conservatives unwilling to accept an _meta_percent_ref_ solution but that s not what we re talking about here _meta_end_dot_

 the republicans don t see that if they cease to support fiscal responsibility small government less regulation an open free market fierce self defense sovereignty life they cease to become republicans _meta_end_dot_

 they are political animals buffeted about by every political wind because they re more concerned about power than principle and they justify their craven natures by saying that no principles can be supported if they aren t in power _meta_end_dot_

 we ll soon find out if they re right because the republicans are going to lose big in the fall _meta_end_dot_

 they ll be tempted again to blame bush but i suggest they look in the mirror _meta_end_dot_

 return to the optimistic message that the common man is powerful and the strength of our country _meta_end_dot_

 give the common man power by making sure he has as many economic choices as possible _meta_end_dot_

 keep him safe from harm so he can work _meta_end_dot_

 cut his taxes so he can grow _meta_end_dot_

 help him educate his children by giving him educational choices _meta_end_dot_

 in short start loving the people who give you power _meta_end_dot_

 respect them _meta_end_dot_

 they understand the political realities more than you know _meta_end_dot_

 compromise is palatable if they re made on the backdrop of principle but your voters need to believe you hold a principle _meta_end_dot_

 and for heaven sakes articulate a vision _meta_end_dot_

 mr _meta_end_dot_

 hope change at least gets that _meta_end_dot_

 find a charismatic communicative fearless republican and have him say these things _meta_end_dot_

 you ll get elected but right now you guys have it backwards _meta_end_dot_

 there is still time to turn it around _meta_end_dot_

 otherwise the wilderness will become a permanent home _meta_end_dot_
