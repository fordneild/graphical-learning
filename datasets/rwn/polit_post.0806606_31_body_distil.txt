  if you look at the exit polling in ohio and texas you can t help but notice something that has become a fairly consistent trend in the democratic race in texas white _meta_number_ref_ and older clinton _meta_percent_ref_ black _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ clinton _meta_percent_ref_ black _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ clinton _meta_percent_ref_ in ohio white democrats clinton _meta_percent_ref_ black democrats clinton _meta_percent_ref_ so we have hillary clinton and barack obama two very similar candidates running for the presidency _meta_end_dot_

 but black democrats are breaking for obama at better than an _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ clip and white democrats particularly older white democrats are breaking towards hillary at about _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 dare i suggest that race is a significant factor here _meta_end_question_

 many white democrats particularly older white democrats are voting for hillary because she s white and many black democrats are voting for barack in large part because he s black _meta_end_dot_

 that leads us to an interesting question who s a bigger racist _meta_end_question_

 a black democrat who votes for obama because he s black or a white democrat who votes for hillary because he won t vote for a black man _meta_end_question_

 the answer it was a trick question _meta_end_dot_

 both groups of people are just as racist and just as deplorable _meta_end_dot_
