  right now you might be saying teach are you drunk _meta_end_question_

 have you drunk the liberal kool aid _meta_end_question_

 or are you just a bit fetched in the head maybe a bit of _meta_number_ref_ and _meta_number_ref_ but let s think about what the pick of biden brings _meta_end_dot_

 there is not much point in going over what so many pundits and columnists wrote saturday _meta_end_dot_

 the basics that most both left and right came to was he really ads nothing to the ticket _meta_end_dot_

 he won t bring in many votes he won t help with the south he makes obama look like the foreign policy neophyte he really is heck he makes barry look like a neophyte in most things _meta_end_dot_

 joe is much more qualified to be president then barry _meta_end_dot_

 he has those massive ties to lobbyists that barry whines about _meta_end_dot_

 he is a massive washington insider _meta_end_dot_

 this has really pissed of hillary s supporters _meta_end_dot_

 etc and so on and sure there were many on the left and right who wrote that this was a massively bad pick _meta_end_dot_

 some on the left tried to spin it positively but you know they were popping out a post quickly so they could get back to cleaning the bathroom _meta_end_dot_

 and women have not been entirely enthused with the pick _meta_end_dot_

 but this was a great pick _meta_end_dot_

 no still not drunk _meta_end_dot_

 the reason is simple biden carries a massive amount of baggage as so many have pointed out _meta_end_dot_

 the gaffes the racism the runaway mouth the lobbyist ties the washington insider mentality _meta_end_dot_

 and how much and how often will the right side of the internet along with the miniscule conservative leaning media folks like rush hannity levin et all bring joe s negatives up _meta_end_question_

 and when he does or says something dumb _meta_end_question_

 even the liberal media might come out from their doggie houses and notice _meta_end_dot_

 from my point of view the pick of joe _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ is one designed to deflect away from barry and his character issues his lack of advertised substance and policy we know what he really stands for but that will not make it into the mainstream media gaffes barry makes and his inexperience _meta_end_dot_

 joe can get out there and attack attack attack while barry sits back and plays mr _meta_end_dot_

 lovable hope and change without getting his hands dirty _meta_end_dot_

 even the ap climbed out of their liberal tree house made of arugula to notice that biden fills the attack role _meta_end_dot_

 this way barry can remain articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy _meta_end_dot_

 anything that keeps the eyes focused off barry s negatives is a positive for barry _meta_end_dot_

 that anything is joe biden _meta_end_dot_

 so the best thing to do is mostly ignore biden _meta_end_dot_

 when he goes on the attack do not address the responses to joe but back to barry _meta_end_dot_

 consider mccain s latest attack which attempts to get to hillary supporters over the pick of biden _meta_end_dot_

 go after barry not joe _meta_end_dot_

 joe is barry s shield _meta_end_dot_

 treat joe as a sideshow much like john edwards was treated during the _meta_number_ref_ cycle _meta_end_dot_
