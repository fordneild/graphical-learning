  despite the fact that the planet hasn t warmed very much over the last century that it hasn t gotten warmer over roughly the last decade that it isn t expected to get warmer over the next decade or so and that over _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ u s _meta_end_dot_

 scientists deny man made global warming the fanaticism of the global warming alarmists doesn t seem to have been dimmed one iota _meta_end_dot_

 to the contrary as more and more holes are being blasted into the manmade global warming theory al gore and company seem to be suggesting ever more draconian solutions to prevent ever wilder and less plausible doomsday scenarios _meta_end_dot_

 for example imagine what a nightmare it would be to implement this bizarre regulatory scheme they re suggesting in britain here in the united states every adult should be forced to use a carbon ration card when they pay for petrol airline tickets or household energy mps say _meta_end_dot_

 the influential environmental audit committee says a personal carbon trading scheme is the best and fairest way of cutting britain s co_meta_number_ref_ emissions without penalising the poor _meta_end_dot_

 under the scheme everyone would be given an annual carbon allowance to use when buying oil gas electricity and flights _meta_end_dot_

 anyone who exceeds their entitlement would have to buy top up credits from individuals who haven t used up their allowance _meta_end_dot_

 the amount paid would be driven by market forces and the deal done through a specialist company _meta_end_dot_

 mps led by tory tim yeo say the scheme could be more effective at cutting greenhouse gas emissions than green taxes _meta_end_dot_

 but critics say the idea is costly bureaucratic intrusive and unworkable _meta_end_dot_

 the government says it supports the scheme in principle but warns it is ahead of its time _meta_end_dot_

 the idea of personal carbon trading is increasingly being promoted by environmentalists _meta_end_dot_

 in theory it could be used to cover all purchases from petrol to food _meta_end_dot_

 for the scheme to work the government would need to give out _meta_number_ref_million carbon cards each one linked to a personal carbon account _meta_end_dot_

 every year the account would be credited with a notional amount of co_meta_number_ref_ in kilograms _meta_end_dot_

 the climate change bill going through parliament aims to cut emissions by _meta_number_ref_ per cent by _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 the government has said it backs the idea in principle but it is currently too expensive and bureaucratic _meta_end_dot_

 environment minister hilary benn said it s got potential but in essence it s ahead of its time _meta_end_dot_

 there are a lot of practical problems to overcome a department for environment food and rural affairs report into the scheme found it would cost between _meta_number_ref_million and _meta_number_ref_billion to set up and up to another _meta_number_ref_billion a year to run _meta_end_dot_

 tory environment spokesman peter ainsworth added although it does have potential we should proceed with care _meta_end_dot_

 we don t want to alienate people and we want everyone to be on board but critics say the idea is deeply flawed _meta_end_dot_

 the scheme would penalise those living in the countryside who were dependent on their cars as well as the elderly or housebound who need to heat their homes in the day _meta_end_dot_

 large families would suffer as would those working at nights when little public transport is available _meta_end_dot_

 it would need to take into account the size of families and their ages _meta_end_dot_

 there is huge potential for fraud _meta_end_dot_

 matthew elliott of the taxpayers alliance said the cards would be hugely unpopular _meta_end_dot_

 the government has shown itself incapable of managing any huge complex it system he said _meta_end_dot_

 the complex regulatory scheme the government intrusion into people s every day lives the massive increase of government power the socialistic wealth transfers the potential for fraud it s a liberal dream program _meta_end_dot_

 if obama gore and company thought they could get away with this they d be proposing it tomorrow _meta_end_dot_
