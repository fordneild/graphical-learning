  i m not even going to pull the new york times passage for further circulation but unnamed sources think there might have been a sex scandal but aren t really sure which may or may not have been connected to an ethics scandal that they re not even sure existed the evidence for which all comes from eight years ago and which naturally warrants dredging up the details of an actual ethics scandal for which mccain was punished and has duly apologized and seen the light for incessantly since it happened ahem _meta_number_ref_ years ago mary katharine ham a few days ago a blogger mailing list that i ended up on somehow made note of a story about barack obama _meta_end_dot_

 long story short there is a guy named larry sinclair out there claiming that he snorted cocaine with barack obama in _meta_number_ref_ and then went down on him _meta_end_dot_

 is that true _meta_end_question_

 i have no idea _meta_end_dot_

 but the general sentiment on that mailing list seemed to be that story was beneath us and that as conservative bloggers we shouldn t touch it with a ten foot pole _meta_end_dot_

 i had a different reaction _meta_end_dot_

 when i saw the story i sent a one word reply linked and it was on conservative grapevine right before i sent out the email _meta_end_dot_

 why _meta_end_question_

 because not only does the left side of the blogosphere have zero qualms about promoting this kind of story when it involves republicans the mainstream media has absolutely no qualms about it either _meta_end_dot_

 when a democrat is accused of some sort of affair the mainstream media is extremely concerned about making _meta_percent_ref_ sure the story is drop dead accurate down to the last detail before they ll even begin to think about printing the story _meta_end_dot_

 that s why drudge broke the monica lewinsky story to the public not the msm _meta_end_dot_

 it s also why stories about affairs involving john kerry john edwards barack obama and bill clinton have been buried or not printed at all in most msm outlets over the last few years _meta_end_dot_

 however when a republican is involved weekly week world news standards become the order of the day and no excuse is too flimsy to run a story about an alleged scandal _meta_end_dot_

 unfortunately for john mccain now that he s the republican nominee for president the msm has revoked his honorary democrat status and is treating him just like any other republican which is why the new york times has published one of the flimsiest most insubstantial smear pieces since their attacks on george bush in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 in short the new york times rehashed the _meta_number_ref_ year old keating five affair and accused mccain of being unethical and having an affair based on well almost nothing _meta_end_dot_

 the hotter story is of course the allegation johnny mac was playing the field _meta_end_dot_

 here s the evidence that the new york times has for that stunning allegation that both mccain and the woman he s supposed to have had an affair with vicki iseman deny _meta_end_dot_

 a female lobbyist had been turning up with him at fund raisers visiting his offices and accompanying him on a client s corporate jet _meta_end_dot_

 convinced the relationship had become romantic some of his top advisers intervened to protect the candidate from himself instructing staff members to block the woman s access privately warning her away and repeatedly confronting him several people involved in the campaign said on the condition of anonymity _meta_end_dot_

 mr _meta_end_dot_

 black said mr _meta_end_dot_

 mccain and ms _meta_end_dot_

 iseman were friends and nothing more _meta_end_dot_

 but in _meta_number_ref_ she began showing up so frequently in his offices and at campaign events that staff members took notice _meta_end_dot_

 one recalled asking why is she always around that february mr _meta_end_dot_

 mccain and ms _meta_end_dot_

 iseman attended a small fund raising dinner with several clients at the miami area home of a cruise line executive and then flew back to washington along with a campaign aide on the corporate jet of one of her clients paxson communications _meta_end_dot_

 by then according to two former mccain associates some of the senator s advisers had grown so concerned that the relationship had become romantic that they took steps to intervene _meta_end_dot_

 a former campaign adviser described being instructed to keep ms _meta_end_dot_

 iseman away from the senator at public events while a senate aide recalled plans to limit ms _meta_end_dot_

 iseman s access to his offices _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 in interviews the two former associates said they joined in a series of confrontations with mr _meta_end_dot_

 mccain warning him that he was risking his campaign and career _meta_end_dot_

 both said mr _meta_end_dot_

 mccain acknowledged behaving inappropriately and pledged to keep his distance from ms _meta_end_dot_

 iseman _meta_end_dot_

 the two associates who said they had become disillusioned with the senator spoke independently of each other and provided details that were corroborated by others _meta_end_dot_

 separately a top mccain aide met with ms _meta_end_dot_

 iseman at union station in washington to ask her to stay away from the senator _meta_end_dot_

 john weaver a former top strategist and now an informal campaign adviser said in an e mail message that he arranged the meeting after a discussion among the campaign leadership about her _meta_end_dot_

 our political messaging during that time period centered around taking on the special interests and placing the nation s interests before either personal or special interest mr _meta_end_dot_

 weaver continued _meta_end_dot_

 ms _meta_end_dot_

 iseman s involvement in the campaign it was felt by us could undermine that effort so ah where s the beef _meta_end_question_

 mccain s staff thought he was hanging around with an attractive female lobbyist too much was concerned that it would look bad and asked him to stop probably out of fear that it would end up in the new york times one day _meta_end_dot_

 so far so good _meta_end_dot_

 but i don t see a single specific allegation in there that mccain and iseman ever slept together kissed went on a date or for that matter were ever even alone together _meta_end_dot_

 yet on drudge we have mccain forced to deny romantic link with lobbyist it s a rotten irresponsible story that doesn t even meet the standards of the larry sinclair story _meta_end_dot_

 at least in that story you have an actual person willing to go on the record and make an allegation that he had sex and cocaine with barack obama _meta_end_dot_

 in the end sinclair s tale may be every bit as bogus as the nyt hit piece that just came out in the times but that begs a question is there any reason that the mccain affair story is in the new york times and the obama affair story isn t that goes beyond the fact that mccain is a republican and obama is a democrat _meta_end_question_
