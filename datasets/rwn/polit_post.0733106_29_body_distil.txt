  i think the fact of the matter is that sen _meta_end_dot_

 clinton is claiming basically the entire eight years of the clinton presidency as her own except for the stuff that didn t work out in which case she says she has nothing to do with it _meta_end_dot_

 there is no doubt that bill clinton had faith in her and consulted with her on issues in the same way that i would consult with michelle if there were issues _meta_end_dot_

 on the other had i don t think michelle would claim that she is the best qualified person to be a united states senator by virtue of me talking to her on occasion about the work i ve done barack obama if a ceo of a fortune _meta_number_ref_ company were to retire would anyone seriously consider his wife to be an adequate replacement simply because she was married to him when he ran the company _meta_end_question_

 what about a super bowl winning football team _meta_end_question_

 what do you think the reaction of their fans would be if their coach s wife was being seriously discussed as his replacement _meta_end_question_

 it sounds ridiculous doesn t it _meta_end_question_

 yet hillary clinton has practically been anointed by the press and the punditocracy as our next president despite the fact that her run at the presidency is almost entirely based on being bill clinton s wife john hawkins in my townhall column from nov _meta_number_ref_ does marrying bill clinton qualify someone to be president _meta_end_question_

 that column was the _meta_number_ref_nd most forwarded article on townhall that week and it got picked up all over the place _meta_end_dot_

 so what do you think _meta_end_question_

 did it influence obama to take that line of attack against hillary _meta_end_question_

 i ll probably never know _meta_end_dot_

 that s one of the curses of bloggerdom _meta_end_dot_

 you see political campaigns and big name columnists talking about the same things you ve talked about in the same way but you almost never get to find out if it s coincidence or if you gave them the idea _meta_end_dot_
