  resorted to the courts to try to get admitted to the saddleback forum _meta_end_dot_

 so the libertarians think that the federal courts should tell a private church and pastor whom they can invite to a political discussion _meta_end_dot_

 and i m sure they ll be trying the same thing when it comes to the debates shown on network television _meta_end_dot_

 and they ll get the same answer _meta_end_dot_

 there is no federal right to gain public attention in the election season especially for a marginal candidate receiving just a few percentage points in the polls _meta_end_dot_

 it s a vicious cycle where low public attention leads to low public support which leads to less public attention and so forth _meta_end_dot_

 but that is what these minor party candidates know that they face when they decide to launch their campaigns instead of trying to work within the major parties to try to effect change from the inside _meta_end_dot_

 instead they end up spending about half their campaign whining about their lack of coverage _meta_end_dot_

 well that s the business they ve chosen and they knew it going in _meta_end_dot_

 it s especially disingenuous to have a party that is devoted to smaller government resorting to the courts to try to force other entities to give them the attention they think they deserve _meta_end_dot_
