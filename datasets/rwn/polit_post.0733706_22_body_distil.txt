  after four and a half months of dragging it out the new republic has finally reluctantly admitted that they were duped by fabulist scott thomas beauchamp _meta_end_dot_

 but even now at this late date the new republic couldn t just come right out and plainly admit that their critics were right and they were wrong _meta_end_dot_

 instead editor franklin foer wrote a _meta_number_ref_ page response all of which except for the last paragraph which follows was nothing more than a lame attempt to cya when i last spoke with beauchamp in early november he continued to stand by his stories _meta_end_dot_

 unfortunately the standards of this magazine require more than that _meta_end_dot_

 and in light of the evidence available to us after months of intensive re reporting we cannot be confident that the events in his pieces occurred in exactly the manner that he described them _meta_end_dot_

 without that essential confidence we cannot stand by these stories although the final paragraph says it all there were a few items worth noting from foer s long rambling screed that i think may help explain how the new republic got duped in the first place _meta_end_dot_

 first of all this sentence stuck out because it reminded me of rathergate our writer s identity required protection he was far away and the events themselves occurred in a war zone in the case of the rathergate the source of the story was a mentally unstable liberal with an ax to grind against the bush family who wouldn t have been considered a reputable source had his identity been known from the beginning _meta_end_dot_

 in this case the writer was married to someone at the new republic who was actually assigned to fact check his work _meta_end_dot_

 in both cases you can t help but notice that the anonymity of the story s source was used to shield the source from obvious questions that would have been raised had their identities been known from the beginning _meta_end_dot_

 next up is the fact checking and oh boy does that belong in quotes that the new republic did before beauchamp s articles were published fact checking is a process used by most magazines but not most newspapers to independently verify what s in their articles _meta_end_dot_

 beauchamp s anonymity complicated this process _meta_end_dot_

 because we promised to protect his identity we were reluctant to call army public affairs to review his claims _meta_end_dot_

 what s more the fact checking of first person articles about personal experiences necessarily relies heavily on the author s word and description of events _meta_end_dot_

 but there was one avoidable problem with our beauchamp fact check _meta_end_dot_

 his wife reeve was assigned a large role in checking his third piece _meta_end_dot_

 while we believe she acted with good faith and integrity not just in this instance but throughout this whole ordeal there was a clear conflict of interest _meta_end_dot_

 at the time our logic in hindsight obviously flawed was that corresponding with a soldier in iraq is logistically difficult and reeve was already routinely speaking with him _meta_end_dot_

 it was a mistake and we ve imposed new rules to prevent future fact checking conflicts of interest _meta_end_dot_

 facing the difficulties of verifying the piece but wanting to ensure its plausibility before publication we sent the piece to a correspondent for a major newspaper who had spent many tours embedded in iraq _meta_end_dot_

 he had heard accounts of soldiers killing dogs with bradleys _meta_end_dot_

 these accounts stuck with him because they represented a symbolic shift in the war _meta_end_dot_

 iraqis regard dogs as annoying pests _meta_end_dot_

 at the beginning of the conflict americans made great efforts to befriend these mistreated mutts _meta_end_dot_

 it seemed telling that americans now treated dogs with as little regard as iraqis did _meta_end_dot_

 he considered beauchamp s dog hunting anecdote plausible _meta_end_dot_

 but the reporter doubted the tale of the disfigured woman _meta_end_dot_

 what would a woman with the disfigurements described by beauchamp be doing in a war zone _meta_end_question_

 this became the focal point of our fact checking _meta_end_dot_

 we asked reeve to push beauchamp for corroboration of this woman s existence _meta_end_dot_

 in an e mail she relayed his answer in other words to the new republic fact checking basically consists of calling up a war correspondent and saying something like does this sound plausible to you then even after his reply is something like well part of it does you ask the source s wife to talk with her husband and confirm the story is true _meta_end_dot_

 then you run it _meta_end_dot_

 remember that whenever someone tells you about the multiple layers of fact checking that makes the mainstream media so superior to the blogosphere _meta_end_dot_

 after reading that nonsense this line really jumped out at me i hadn t worked with stephen glass who made up stories out of whole cloth but i knew the lessons derived from that scandal he knew the lessons derived from that scandal really _meta_end_question_

 apparently one of those lessons wasn t to do any real fact checking before you run a piece _meta_end_dot_

 additionally this line suggests that foer had deep doubts about beauchamp s stories practically from the moment that they were questioned during the first week of the investigation i reached beauchamp with regularity on his cell phone _meta_end_dot_

 my calls with him often began the same way _meta_end_dot_

 you re not a professional journalist i would tell him _meta_end_dot_

 if you got anything wrong or exaggerated things people will understand it s better to admit error than get caught in a lie every time he stood by his stories _meta_end_dot_

 if he thought beauchamp was telling the truth he wouldn t have tried to prompt him to admit that he got anything wrong or exaggerated things or suggested that he might get caught in a lie in other words foer suspected beauchamp was full of it almost from the beginning _meta_end_dot_

 so what does that say about the decision to publish his stories in the first place _meta_end_question_

 why did it take the new republic so long to admit that they were duped again _meta_end_question_

 it s nothing more than a cya mentality _meta_end_dot_

 also the new republic notes that they bought into the story in large part because beauchamp was putting his buddies on the phone with them the nature of these contacts wasn t ideal beauchamp was soliciting his own witnesses _meta_end_dot_

 but once beauchamp established the initial contact we tried to communicate with these soldiers independently _meta_end_dot_

 we always considered the possibility that they were lying to cover for their friend but there was no way for us to know that for certain and we couldn t dismiss what they told us _meta_end_dot_

 they were not only beauchamp s buddies but in some instances the only witnesses to the events described _meta_end_dot_

 these guys are friends with beauchamp and the new republic promised them anonymity _meta_end_dot_

 it s extremely easy to imagine a conversation like this happening hey look i need you to do me a favor _meta_end_dot_

 tell this guy that you saw a burned woman at the base _meta_end_dot_

 i know i know i shouldn t have lied to them in the first place but my wife works there and if i admit i made it up she ll get in a lot of trouble _meta_end_dot_

 don t worry there s no way this will ever come back to you foer then goes on to carp bitterly about the military being more cooperative with friendly media sources rather than the new republic but is that really a surprise _meta_end_question_

 the new republic published untrue stories designed to smear the military and try to make them look bad _meta_end_dot_

 why would they then bend over backwards to cooperate with nr _meta_end_question_

 from there the new republic implies the military made beauchamp lie to them under duress and says that major john cross who hung beauchamp out to dry in a public interview with bob owens at pajamas media bolstered beauchamp s credibility when he talked to them privately _meta_end_dot_

 maybe this is why the military wasn t cooperating with nr they suspected that nr was looking to blindside them yet again _meta_end_dot_

 anyway the point of all this seemed to be to imply that this is some sort of military cover up and that beauchamp is really telling the truth but that nr can t prove it and so they re going to have to refuse to back his stories _meta_end_dot_

 in other words it s the weasel s way out particularly since they go on to note that beauchamp isn t acting like an innocent man but after our re reporting some of our questions are still unanswered _meta_end_dot_

 did the driver intentionally run over dogs _meta_end_question_

 did he record his kills in a little green notebook _meta_end_question_

 we ve never been able to reach the driver _meta_end_dot_

 and beauchamp told us that he d procure a page from the notebook but that has not materialized _meta_end_dot_

 this is a plausible anecdote and several soldiers in beauchamp s unit had heard stories about dog hunting but only one had actually seen the driver beauchamp wrote about intentionally hit dogs _meta_end_dot_

 he is one of beauchamp s friends and over the course of a number of e mail exchanges with him our faith in him has diminished _meta_end_dot_

 several weeks after the monitored call in september we finally had the opportunity to ask beauchamp without any of his supervisors on the line about how he could mistake a dining hall in kuwait for one in iraq _meta_end_dot_

 he told us he considered the detail to be mundane given the far more horrific events he had witnessed _meta_end_dot_

 that s not a convincing explanation _meta_end_dot_

 if the event was so mundane why did he write about it and with such vivid detail _meta_end_question_

 in accounting for the inaccuracy of a central fact he sounded defensive and evasive _meta_end_dot_

 beauchamp has lived through this ordeal under the most trying of conditions _meta_end_dot_

 he is facing pressures that we can only begin to imagine _meta_end_dot_

 and over the course of our dealings with him we ve tried to give him the benefit of the doubt _meta_end_dot_

 ever since august we ve asked him first though his wife and lawyer and later via direct e mail and phone calls to personally obtain the sworn statements that the military had him draft and sign on july _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 and ever since then he has promised repeatedly to do just that _meta_end_dot_

 we are unfortunately still waiting _meta_end_dot_

 translation they think beauchamp s friend is lying to them mistaking a dining hall in iraq for ione in kuwait makes no sense given that beauchamp is claiming he mocked the disfigured woman after being desensitized to violence in iraq and he doesn t want to give them his sworn statements because it would show right there in black and white that he told the military that he lied to them _meta_end_dot_

 long story short this is just another example of how the cover up is worse than the crime _meta_end_dot_

 yes it would have been horribly embarrassing for the new republic to admit that they ve been duped by another stephen glass but essentially they ve had to admit that anyway after being slowly bled white during a futile effort to stonewall the whole scandal since july _meta_end_dot_

 had they been more honest from the beginning or more importantly done some real fact checking before they published stories slamming the troops they could have saved themselves and the reputation of the new republic a lot of unneeded trouble _meta_end_dot_
