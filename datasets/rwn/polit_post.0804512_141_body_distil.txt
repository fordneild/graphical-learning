  i called up pearatty last night after watching a particularly horrific hillary clintton interview with george somethingsomethingopolis _meta_end_dot_

 i m losing faith i cried maybe obama is better dawn she said obama is all style _meta_end_dot_

 no substance _meta_end_dot_

 he s all i want to send children to the moon and then when you ask how he says hope that made me laugh _meta_end_dot_

 he totally would say hope liberal blogger dawn summers at clareified hat tip to alarming news for that quote _meta_end_dot_

 obama s big themes are change hope and unity i suspect that after he s elected we ll hear much less about change and unity and a lot more about hope _meta_end_dot_

 as in i hope this doesn t end in a huge disaster _meta_end_dot_

 i hope he doesn t wreck the economy _meta_end_dot_

 i hope he s not too overwhelmed by the complexity and horror of the world _meta_end_dot_

 i hope i survive this administration btw prepare now for the national orgy of self congratulations starting with his inauguration and climaxing with his first state of the union _meta_end_dot_

 after that it all goes downhill rather quickly _meta_end_dot_

 buy gold _meta_end_dot_
