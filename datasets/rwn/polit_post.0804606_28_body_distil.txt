  question given the success of recent movies like batman begins and _meta_number_ref_ and more movies coming like hulk ii batman dk and watchmen what comic book storylines and characters would you like to see be made into movies and why _meta_end_question_

 posters please do not start answering this question until we see if mr _meta_end_dot_

 hawkins will pick it up _meta_end_dot_

 we can then have an entire thread for it _meta_end_dot_

 shout out to gob d vega answer one of my favorite comics was groo a funny comic about a sword slinging barbarian who kills everything that moves and brings disaster wherever he goes _meta_end_dot_

 you could make a great groo movie _meta_end_dot_

 along similar lines i d love to see a conan the king storyline featuring ah nold as conan after he had taken over a kingdom had it taken from him and fought to get it back _meta_end_dot_

 you could do a pretty good made for tv movie featuring spike from the buffyverse _meta_end_dot_

 also it would be great to see another vampire slayer series from joss whedon _meta_end_dot_

 that would be on tv not at the movies but still _meta_end_dot_

 i read the elric of melnibone books not the comics but you could make one hell of a good trilogy out of it _meta_end_dot_

 an evil sorcerer king fighting on the side of good carrying an ultra powerful intelligent sword that thirsts for the souls of his friends and enemies alike awesome _meta_end_exclamation_

 a marvel secret wars movie could be pretty good as well if it had a good script _meta_end_dot_

 however it might be a little tough to capture that much action and explain that many super heroes in a movie _meta_end_dot_

 ps the watchmen was a pretty solid graphic novel but i think it might be a little hard to capture everything that happened in a single movie _meta_end_dot_
