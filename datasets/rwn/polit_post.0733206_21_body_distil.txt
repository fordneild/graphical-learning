  tonight i ll be liveblogging the cnn youtube debate that starts at _meta_number_ref_ pm est _meta_end_dot_

 ps since we have less than _meta_number_ref_ weeks to go until the first primary and we have rudy in first place nationally with _meta_number_ref_ other candidates for all intents and purposes tied for _meta_number_ref_nd place this is going to be the most important debate yet _meta_end_dot_

 ps _meta_number_ref_ i don t expect to see any snowmen or crazed rednecks asking questions because i ve heard that some of the candidates as a condition of participating told cnn they didn t want to take any ridiculous questions that demeaned the presidency _meta_end_dot_

 we ll see how it plays out _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ oh boy _meta_end_exclamation_

 pointless introductions _meta_end_exclamation_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ tom cancredo _meta_end_question_

 wasn t that what he said instead of tancredo _meta_end_question_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ cnn basically says no questions from incredibly stupid sources _meta_end_dot_

 that s a plus although it s funny that they felt compelled to brag about it _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ oh boy _meta_end_exclamation_

 some dork signing to start things off _meta_end_dot_

 super _meta_end_exclamation_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ ok it was a good song _meta_end_dot_

 still it s _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ and we still haven t had a real question _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ wow rudy is such a bald faced liar _meta_end_dot_

 we are not a sanctuary city but we gave sanctuary to illegals who weren t criminals _meta_end_dot_

 does anyone buy this sort of thing _meta_end_question_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ applause line because mitt just nailed rudy _meta_end_dot_

 of course there were sanctuary cities in mass _meta_end_dot_

 under romney too _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ both rudy and romney stink on illegal immigration and they re the ones debating it _meta_end_dot_

 neither one of them is coming off particularly well here if you ask me _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ let s see anderson cooper has completely lost control of the debate rudy is an enormous jerk and with mitt the lady doth protest too much _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ fred s answer is outstanding _meta_end_dot_

 fred now has to get in on the bashing of rudy and fred because that s the only thing that gets covered _meta_end_dot_

 fred had a good answer but it was a little rambling _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ now rudy has spent _meta_number_ref_ minutes lying about new york being a sanctuary city and now we have john mccain lying about his amnesty plan _meta_end_dot_

 so if he pledges no amnesty but denies that his last plan was amnesty how can you believe him now _meta_end_question_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ anderson may be an even worse moderator than wolf blitzer _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ it s totally true that everyone wants to try to out tancredo tancredo _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ i reject the idea categorically that there are jobs that no american will take _meta_end_dot_

 bam _meta_end_exclamation_

 the first really killer answer of the night _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ good right on target answer from duncan but he has been saying this exact same thing since about jan of this year _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ now it s huckabee s turn to lie about his record on illegal immigration _meta_end_dot_

 huckabee mccain giuliani and romeny all have horrible records on illegal immigration and now because that s unpopular they have to pretend to be serious about doing something about it _meta_end_dot_

 fred s the only top tier guy who has a halfway decent record on it and is the only guy who gave a halfway decent answer _meta_end_dot_

 tanc and duncan are head and shoulders above all of them on the answers _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ now we git mitt who was a pro illegal immigration pol pretending to be tough on illegals attacking huckabee who was a pro illegal immigration pol pretending to be tough on illegals _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ mitt has gotten his behind kicked from one end of the stage to the other tonight even though his message is better than huckabee and giuliani on the issue _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ i love it _meta_end_exclamation_

 a nau conspiracy question for paul and he s telling people he buys into it while trying to dodge the question to keep from saying that bush is merging canada with mexico _meta_end_dot_

 hah ha _meta_end_exclamation_

 the eye raise mccain just gave behind him was priceless _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ the first _meta_number_ref_ minutes of this debate made the gop look terrible with a few exceptions _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ mccain does have a great record on fiscal conservative issues _meta_end_dot_

 pretty good answer on fiscal spending issues _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ mitt and giuliani did ok too _meta_end_dot_

 nothing special but solid on fiscal conservative answers _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ fred is giving good answers there is substance behind them but he s a little flat _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ cnn really runs lousy debates _meta_end_dot_

 they waste time at the start of the debate their moderators stink and they allow the crowd to be too loud _meta_end_dot_

 all this booing and cheering really shouldn t be going on _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ huckabee gave a nice answer but it s not plausible _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ mccain just obliterated ron paul _meta_end_dot_

 best moment of the debate so far _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ a bunch of idiots shouting in the audience _meta_end_dot_

 ugh _meta_end_dot_

 also paul s answer was silly as per usual on foreign policy _meta_end_dot_

 he is an isolationist _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ ranking of performance at this point in the debate _meta_number_ref_ mccain giuliani _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ this question shows you what happens when conservative principles meet political pragmatism _meta_end_dot_

 we shouldn t have farm subsidies but for political purposes they can t be honest enough to say that _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ that commercial really doesn t show that tanc is ready for the main event _meta_end_dot_

 i sort of liked it but it s totally a web ad i wouldn t want to run in an event like this _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ tanc gave a decent answer on china _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ duncan shoots and he scores with buy american _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ ha _meta_end_exclamation_

 fred s campaign sent in an attack ad _meta_end_question_

 wow _meta_end_dot_

 that s a brassy decision _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ funny answer _meta_end_dot_

 i just wanted to give my buddies a little extra air time _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ mitt doesn t respond well to being hit _meta_end_dot_

 he didn t in the last debate and he hasn t in this one either _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ ehr huckabee isn t out front hence his joke is kind of lame _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ from the comments section romney s hair is simply tremendous tonight _meta_end_dot_

 it owns the stage _meta_end_dot_

 it somehow is shiny and a light absorbing jet black at the same time _meta_end_dot_

 utterly dominant mike_m _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ that was a great moment for mccain and this short commercial doesn t really capture it effectively _meta_end_dot_

 i would have gone with something else _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ the only guy who is really interesting to ask a gun control question to is rudy because he favored gun control in new york _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ well that hit rudy on gun control the written exam question is pretty weak tho given his record _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ someone attacks rudy s record on conservative issues and he goes on to talk about his record of fighting crime in new york _meta_end_dot_

 that s so tired _meta_end_dot_

 if i have to listen to that all through _meta_number_ref_ i m going to gouge my eyes out with a spoon _meta_end_dot_

 also if rudy really believed that the _meta_number_ref_nd amendment applies to the individuals then how is it that rudy was a gun grabber in ny _meta_end_question_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ fred thompson slapped rudy on gun control pretty well _meta_end_dot_

 still he s a little off somehow _meta_end_question_

 maybe it s no eye contact or something _meta_end_question_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ i really like this question about what guns the candidates have because it helps let you know where the rubber meets the road _meta_end_dot_

 rudy doesn t earn a gun and mitt doesn t have a gun either _meta_end_question_

 no big surprise there _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ another great question _meta_end_dot_

 i want to know what the candidates will do about black on black crime too _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ mitt is right that we need better schools and more moms and dad but that doesn t help black on black crime right now _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ this should be rudy s issue although ironically i am completely sick of listening to rudy talk about crime in new york by now _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ i will give ron paul a brownie point if he doesn t mention the gold standard neocons or iraq on this abortion question _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ hey another applause line for fred on getting rid of roe v _meta_end_dot_

 wade and how that should be our _meta_number_ref_ priority _meta_end_dot_

 a little more energy on that question _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ interesting question about a federal ban on abortion but it s completely hypothetical _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ romney is giving a good answer on the abortion ban _meta_end_dot_

 i am surprised they didn t give that to thompson because he got in trouble over that _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ what would jesus do on the death penalty _meta_end_question_

 gag _meta_end_dot_

 dumb question of the night so far _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ good answer from huckabee on the death penalty _meta_end_dot_

 he comes across as very serious and giving it a lot of thought _meta_end_dot_

 great answer on jesus being too smart to run for public office _meta_end_dot_

 funny snappy _meta_end_dot_

 great job by huckabee on that one _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ tancredo did a good job on the death penalty _meta_end_dot_

 not as good as huckabee but solid _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ huckabee took a nice little shot at rudy too _meta_end_dot_

 ps i really love to see the democrats asked if they believe in every word in the bible _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ wait giuliani doesn t believe jonah was in the belly of a whale _meta_end_question_

 hmmm _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ this is mike huckabee s question although he is getting a little too preachy here _meta_end_dot_

 he sounds ok but i want someone thinking like a president in office not a preacher _meta_end_dot_

 you can be a former preacher but i don t i want you thinking like my church s preacher when you are dealing with al qaeda or china _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ pretty good giuliani commercial _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ rudy was solid but not spectacular on our relations with the muslim world _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ john mccain is stepping up and asserting himself on iraq _meta_end_dot_

 he is coming across well on it too _meta_end_dot_

 plus he s hammering the democrats _meta_end_dot_

 al qaeda would be saying we beat america is the democrats got their way _meta_end_dot_

 good answer _meta_end_exclamation_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ sigh _meta_end_dot_

 great answer from duncan but very old _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ mitt is being slippery here but most of them probably will _meta_end_dot_

 i wish they would just say yes we will waterboard al qaeda it s not torture and i m not sorry about it _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ john mccain defining torture down _meta_end_dot_

 i believe pol pot stuck people in prison too _meta_end_dot_

 should we not do that because pol pot did it _meta_end_question_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ romney has really utterly sucked tonight _meta_end_dot_

 everytime slaps him he s like a deer in the headlights _meta_end_dot_

 his torture response to mccain was weak _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ if you are not in favor of water boarding i don t think you re serious enough about fighting terror to be commander in chief _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ thompson is invested in a scenario of victory _meta_end_dot_

 another solid issue but not spectacular _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ ron paul america is taking iraq from the iraqis and he s actually using vietnam as something we should be emulating _meta_end_question_

 ugh _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ mccain gets to follow paul that s a gift _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ al qaeda hit us on _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ because we were occupying their country _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ tancredo i wish we were living in ron s world _meta_end_dot_

 yes it would be nice in theoretical isolationism land _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ is there anyone other than george will who thinks rudy is a conservative because he has brought that up a bazillion times _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ ok idiotic dick cheney cartoon _meta_end_dot_

 didn t cnn say earlier they weren t doing that sort of thing _meta_end_question_

 they re giving fred _meta_number_ref_nd tier questions tonight i notice _meta_end_dot_

 i mean the veep question _meta_end_question_

 are there really large numbers of people making their decision about who wins based on that _meta_end_question_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ anderson cooper was hoping mccain would tee off on cheney there _meta_end_dot_

 he didn t give him what he wanted _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ solid commercial from duncan but several months old _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ huckabee is starting to scare me a little bit _meta_end_dot_

 he reminds me a little of jimmy carter _meta_end_dot_

 he comes across as more like a pastor than a leader _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ ok frank answer from duncan _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ huckabee was ready to get off this question _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ mitt gets shifty and yes he even flip flops on gays in the military _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ what _meta_end_question_

 how did the guy not get an answer _meta_end_question_

 the flatly answered it _meta_end_dot_

 he might not like the answer but he got an answer _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ is this guy getting in on the debate now _meta_end_question_

 why are they giving this give all day to talk _meta_end_question_

 that s a cheap shot from cnn _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ mccain had the best answer on gays in the miltiary but it was still sort of so so _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ last election the log cabin republicans supported john kerry _meta_end_dot_

 mike huckabee is giving a good answer on the question _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ one of the things i would do for his generation is protect them from our generation _meta_end_dot_

 great line from fred on social security _meta_end_dot_

 fred is so spot on on social security _meta_end_dot_

 he is head and tails above all the other candidates on the issue democrat or republican _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ will someone say that the deficit is more important than going to mars _meta_end_question_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ not huckabee _meta_end_dot_

 still he gave a decent answer and the hillary on the mars flight was really funny _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ tanc nails it _meta_end_exclamation_

 awesome _meta_end_exclamation_

 i didn t think anyone would have the guts to say it _meta_end_exclamation_

 applause _meta_end_exclamation_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ good question _meta_end_dot_

 why don t blacks vote republican _meta_end_question_

 let the candidates speak on that issue _meta_end_dot_

 put it out there although rudy doesn t seem to have a lot happening with his answer _meta_end_dot_

 oh geeze you know he is reaching because he s back to what he did in new york _meta_end_dot_

 y a w n _meta_end_exclamation_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ good answer from huckabee _meta_end_dot_

 he got _meta_percent_ref_ of the black vote _meta_end_question_

 wow that s impressive _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ romney doesn t want to discuss the confederate flag but the flag is bad i think or something _meta_end_question_

 the flag shouldn t be shown _meta_end_question_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ i like fred s answer _meta_end_dot_

 nothing too exciting but not bad _meta_end_dot_

 some people see it as heritage and it s ok if they want to fly it but it s better if it s not over the capitol buildings because it s divisive _meta_end_dot_

 that s my position too _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ an infrastructure question is good _meta_end_dot_

 do we need to spend trillions on it though and is it the job of the federal government to do it all _meta_end_question_

 states should do most of it although the feds should help out on roads _meta_end_dot_

 rudy did mention that states and local governments should work too _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ rudy can t even answer a question about bridges and infrastructure without going into iraq _meta_end_dot_

 he s may be the single most annoying republican _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ mccain takes a shot at rudy and wants to send the money back to the states to fix infrastructure _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ rudy fought the line item veto to get pork not for any noble reasons _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ this really isn t an appropriate question either _meta_end_dot_

 ron will you run as a third party candidate _meta_end_question_

 ugh _meta_end_dot_

 cheap from cnn _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ ok let s finish a horribly run debate with a stupid baseball question for rudy _meta_end_dot_

 summary first of all cnn is completely incompetent _meta_end_dot_

 anderson cooper had minimal control of the debate they allowed too much applause and booing and their choice to let the gay guy in the audience babble on and on was completely ridiculous _meta_end_dot_

 also this wasn t a great debate for the gop _meta_end_dot_

 it was a weak performance overall _meta_end_dot_

 the winner john mccain he generally has good debate performances that bloggers and columnists don t give credit for because they despise him _meta_end_dot_

 his whole waterboarding is torture rap undercut his solid foreign policy performance though _meta_end_dot_

 if you re not serious about waterboarding terrorists you re not serious about the war on terror _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_nd fred thompson he gave the best policy answers and was the most conservative but seemed a little flat and has a bad habit of not looking at the camera _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_rd huckabee was generally smooth but i keep having images of jimmy carter going through my head when i hear him talk _meta_end_dot_

 he just seems a little naive and seems to have a little too much of a preacher s mentality to be a good president _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_th tom tancredo he had a good night and gave great answers _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_th duncan who i used to work for gave good answers but he used a little too much canned material _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_th rudy giuliani he came off as a little mean spirited and petty _meta_end_dot_

 he also never shuts up about new york which is getting more annoying by the day _meta_end_dot_

 the loser mitt romney he has a glass chin _meta_end_dot_

 you hit him and he can t respond very well _meta_end_dot_

 then there s ron paul who was at the wrong debate _meta_end_dot_

 maybe he should be at the democratic party debate or the libertarian party debate but he seemed very out of place despite getting in a few good lines amidst his usual idiocy _meta_end_dot_
