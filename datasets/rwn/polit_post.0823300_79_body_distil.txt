  d avid gergen of all people notes one of the outcomes from saddleback which have to have the obama campaign concerned heading into the candidates appearances on saturday night at saddleback church the conventional wisdom in politics was barack obama should have a clear upper hand in any joint appearance with john mccain one the young eloquent cool charismatic dude who can charm birds from the trees the other the meandering sometimes bumbling old fellow who can barely distinguish sunnis from shiias _meta_end_dot_

 well kiss that myth goodbye _meta_end_dot_

 now some will pass it off to a rusty obama _meta_end_dot_

 but that had nothing to do with mccain s performance which proved as gergen points out he is no old fuddy duddy who isn t sure where he is going _meta_end_dot_

 obama in front of a teleprompter delivering a practiced speech is indeed awesome _meta_end_dot_

 obama freelancing is less impressive _meta_end_dot_

 and i believe that the obama campaign has realized that leading to their decision to nix townhall meetings with mccain at which btw mccain excels _meta_end_dot_

 observing this as an obviously interested observer it seems to me that mccain is picking up steam while obama seems to be losing it _meta_end_dot_

 that seems to be gergen s conclusion as well _meta_end_dot_

 so how does obama regain the mojo _meta_end_question_

 here are gergen s thoughts obama must select a running mate who gives a lift to his campaign and can also hammer home a message in the convention and in the vice presidential debate this fall _meta_end_dot_

 he definitely needs a fighter by his side _meta_end_dot_

 for my money hillary clinton looks better and better if not her joe biden is probably the best fighter perhaps evan bayh or a surprise choice the democratic convention in denver has to be a roaring success not only uniting the party but sending a much clearer crisper message about why _meta_number_ref_ more years will be _meta_number_ref_ more years of tears _meta_end_dot_

 obama himself must find his voice again not only in his acceptance address but in the debates _meta_end_dot_

 he needs to bring passion as well as inspiration a clear sense of what the choice is and a compelling sense of why he is strong enough as well as wise enough to lead the country through tough times _meta_end_dot_

 a the vp isn t going to be enough to elect obama this is a referendum on obama b i think the democratic convention has the possibility of being a disaster and c passion and inspiration don t provide answers to specific questions and obama hasn t provided many of those to this point he ll be asked for them again and again in the debates _meta_end_dot_

 one last passing thought the polls are close and i think the reason can be found in the democratic primary _meta_end_dot_

 obama got his biggest wins with the most delegates in primaries which were caucuses _meta_end_dot_

 they are normally driven by activists _meta_end_dot_

 i have begun to wonder if obama really represents the electoral power his campaign tries to portray _meta_end_dot_
