  it has always been my contention that there is no sense in being in office if you don t have the courage to do what is right even if it is the most unpopular position in the world jesse helms at one point in helms life he could fairly have been called a racist but like many pols he left behind his bigoted ways when he left the democratic party _meta_end_dot_

 over time he became a champion of american people of all colors of conservatives and of the people of north carolina _meta_end_dot_

 he was a man of principles a man of courage and he will be greatly missed especially here in his home state _meta_end_dot_

 although it seems appropriate somehow for a great and patriotic man like jesse helms to shuffle off this mortal coil on independence day my condolences go out to his friends and family _meta_end_dot_

 jesse helms will be missed _meta_end_dot_
