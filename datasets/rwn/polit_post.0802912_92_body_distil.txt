  here s a question i received this morning via email i would like to know why the media has not given any coverage to dr _meta_end_dot_

 alan keyes another candidate in the presidential race _meta_end_dot_

 it s almost super tuesday and i as well as many other keyes supporters would like to see dr _meta_end_dot_

 keys receive equal coverage _meta_end_dot_

 americans need to know that they have another choice for president a true reagan conservative _meta_end_dot_

 all they need to do is go to _meta_url_ref_ and also print out and read the _meta_number_ref_ page newsletter at _meta_url_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 if they think dr _meta_end_dot_

 keyes is the right man for the job simply write him in on their ballot and vote keyes _meta_end_dot_

 dr _meta_end_dot_

 keyes website has all the information we need to see him added to the republican ticket _meta_end_dot_

 thank you you know way back in the day when i was a college student i went to an event in charlotte where alan keyes was speaking about abortion _meta_end_dot_

 i didn t know much about him but i was really impressed with him when i left because he was such an eloquent passionate spokesman for the pro life cause _meta_end_dot_

 from that time forward i had a high opinion of alan keyes and apparently a lot of people have shared it because over the years i ve heard many republicans speak highly of him _meta_end_dot_

 but something i m not sure what has happened to alan keyes over the years _meta_end_dot_

 he was drafted to run against barack obama for a senate seat in illinois back in _meta_number_ref_ and he was destroyed after running one of the single worst campaigns of the _meta_number_ref_st century obama _meta_percent_ref_ vs _meta_end_dot_

 keyes _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 the only thing i can even compare it to was katherine harris horrific run at the senate in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 after that disaster keyes shouldn t even be running for the presidency _meta_end_dot_

 on top of that he got in the race very late hasn t run a serious campaign and unsurprisingly hasn t gotten any traction _meta_end_dot_

 moreover i ve seen him in two debates now the values voter debate which unfortunately i think about _meta_number_ref_ people myself included caught and the new hampshire debate _meta_end_dot_

 yes he was passionate in those debates and yes he even said some things that might have been inspiring under other circumstances but didn t really answer questions so much as go on wildly off topic thundering rants complete with weird head movements _meta_end_dot_

 personally i don t think alan keyes looks at this run at the presidency as anything more than a way to draw attention to himself and regrettably because i think he was once an important voice in the conservative movement i think he has diminished himself with the way he has gone about it _meta_end_dot_

 given the circumstances when even serious candidates for the presidency who have been in the race from the beginning have had trouble getting news coverage it s understandable that people haven t paid much attention to alan keyes _meta_end_dot_
