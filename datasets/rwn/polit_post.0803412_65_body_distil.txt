  i wanted to repost something i posted over at hot air a few days ago _meta_end_dot_

 i ve edited and added some stuff to this post that i couldn t do at ha because i couldn t go back and edit my post at ha _meta_end_dot_

 some of the points i made in the following post i made in my last one and in the comments section of it so sorry if parts seem repetitive _meta_end_dot_

 i wrote this after reading some of the comments at ha and other blogs message boards conservative sites like nro and opinion pieces over the last week or so _meta_end_dot_

 like a lot of conservatives i am torn this election because i don t like mccain _meta_end_dot_

 i m not overjoyed with romney either and it s always perplexed me that some of the same people who will wipe the floor in defense of mitt romney like many of the pundits at national review will jump all over john mccain for flip flopping on an issue for political purposes _meta_end_dot_

 yet that is mitt romney s stock and trade _meta_end_dot_

 he s done it for over a decade _meta_end_dot_

 i think it was john derbyshire who wrote over there recently that you didn t know what romney s position was on an issue until you could see which crowd he was speaking in front of _meta_end_dot_

 but between romney and mccain i guess most of the nro crowd somehow believes that romney won t flip flop again whereas they think mccain will _meta_end_dot_

 it makes no sense but whatever _meta_end_dot_

 on the other hand mccain s performance in the debate last night was is a case study on why conservatives can t stand him his arrogance and smugness not to mention his cheap shots on romney for his work in the private sector and his outright lies about romney s postion on timetables for iraq were some of the most offensive things i ve seen from any campaign since the race for the nomination started early last year _meta_end_dot_

 shame on him _meta_end_dot_

 i remember in _meta_number_ref_ how conservatives argued about the importance of getting out to vote because we were in the middle of a war on islamofascism both in iraq and elsewhere and we needed to keep republican leadership who understood what the cost of losing in iraq would mean both in the short and long term none of it good _meta_end_dot_

 kerry would be a disaster conservatives argued because he d be cutting and running out of iraq as fast as he could regardless of the consequences _meta_end_dot_

 conservatives were already disatisfied with bush on a number of issues like immigration the farm bill his alliance with ted kennedy on nclb etc but conservatives knew it would be catastrophic to not vote in the _meta_number_ref_ elections because we wanted our men and women in uniform to be able to come home with their heads held high and for the sacrifices made by their fellow soldiers not to have been made in vain _meta_end_dot_

 not only that but america s reputation as a defender of democracy was at risk if we cut and run and we knew iraq would turn into a genocidal bloodbath if we did so _meta_end_dot_

 so conservatives pushed on and said stay the course with their vote _meta_end_dot_

 not much has changed four years later just the faces of those who want to represent our party in the general election _meta_end_dot_

 the top three mitt mccain and huck all know the value and importance of winning in iraq and not rolling back the progress we ve made in the overall gwot _meta_end_dot_

 we re still in iraq more of our troops have been hurt and maimed and many more have made the ultimate sacrifice all for their country and the people who have stood by them and said we will not forget you since day _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 it has been after all a war worth fighting and one worth winning _meta_end_dot_

 we ve seen the progress in iraq that has taken place in the last year a progress that will continue only if we have a cic who understands what the consequences of failure in iraq and elsewhere are in the fight against islamofascism _meta_end_dot_

 also let s not forget this both barack obama and hillary clinton have stated in so many words that genocide is not a reason to keep us troops in iraq that is an astounding display of ignorance and naivete coming from two people who want to be elected in a position that would see them be the driving force behind our foreign policy decisions and in control of our armed forces _meta_end_dot_

 america has an obligation to finish what it started in iraq not leave it unfinished as we did in vietnam thanks to anti war democrats who still today have not learned their lesson on that front _meta_end_dot_

 we ve already seen that with perseverance and determination things can change for the better in iraq that we can succeed and that one day our troops will be able to come home with their heads held high knowing that not only were they coming home to a country that supports them but a cic who when the chips were are down on the floor wanted them to win too _meta_end_dot_

 on the principles argument one side says i m going to stand on conservative principle and sit out this election because i m fed up with not having more solid conservative options for a nominee and i m not going to settle anymore while the other side is saying i m standing for the conservative principle of victory and honoring committments the us has made but in the end this is not about who has the most or best principles because we all have good principles _meta_end_dot_

 each of us right now is either determining or have already determined which principles are more important _meta_end_dot_

 we do this every election cyle and this one is no different _meta_end_dot_

 no matter what my differences are with the candidates whether we re talking mitt mccain or huck i would not hesitate for a second to pull the lever for any of them against whoever the dem nominee is _meta_end_dot_

 they understand the importance of winning in iraq as well as the overall gwot _meta_end_dot_

 i m not crazy about mccain s position on gitmo or rights for terrorists but on iraq he s been consistent from day one and was for the surge before it was popular to be for the surge so i will give him credit for that and hold my nose and vote for him come election time should he be the nominee _meta_end_dot_

 our troops and their families have made so many sacrifices in this war and all of it done in the name of keeping america safe and spreading democracy in a place where the iron fist of a dictator ruled for decades _meta_end_dot_

 i will never forget the first time i saw a purple finger and read about the iraqis who were defiantly going to the polls in spite of the possiblity that some islamofascist thug or insurgent would try to make a martyr of himself at a polling station _meta_end_dot_

 i think about that and then i read about people who have actually already decided to sit out an election here or vote for a dem candidate or write in another in order to prove some type of point and it saddens me a great deal because the only point it will prove in the end is that the same america who said in _meta_number_ref_ that we shouldn t rest until we ve won in this war will sit back and allow someone into the wh who has no concept about what american honor is about someone who will effectively make it so those same iraqis won t enjoy the right to go out and vote anymore because their country will be overrun by terrorists who want to make it a base for global jihad someone whom our enemies will absolutely love _meta_end_dot_

 the illegal immigration issue is an important one i don t deny that _meta_end_dot_

 and it will be an uphill climb on that issue should mccain be elected president _meta_end_dot_

 on iraq though we d have a strong ally in him _meta_end_dot_

 however electing obama or clinton would be a lose lose situation because neither one of them give a rip about our border nor do they support the war in iraq and as a consequence everything our troops have sacrificed so much for will be in vain _meta_end_dot_

 i for one do not want that on my back _meta_end_dot_

 hillary or obama may win the election regardless but it won t be because i stayed at home or wrote in another candidate s name in protest _meta_end_dot_

 this is a slightly modified to reflect the time i am writing this version of a post i wrote at the sistertoldjah blog last week _meta_end_dot_
