  i don t know if there s any truth to this story i found at the democratic underground or if it s made up from whole cloth but it sounds just crazy enough to be true and either way it s pretty good so i m going to post it demotex in _meta_number_ref_ a philosophy professor put a _meta_number_ref_ automatic colt to my head and said _meta_end_dot_

 defend your existence in retrospect he was trying to jolt me out of a quasi suicidal post vietnam funk _meta_end_dot_

 we were studying kant at the time and i had just submitted a required paper that said only i kant _meta_end_exclamation_

 i kant he called me to his office for a consultation _meta_end_dot_

 hence the gun play episode which changed my life _meta_end_dot_

 his too probably _meta_end_dot_

 i defended for two hours _meta_end_dot_

 specious syllogisms from me got a cocked gun from him _meta_end_dot_

 was he serious with the _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_question_

 i don t know _meta_end_dot_

 in the end i said what he wanted to hear _meta_end_dot_

 and it was indeed what i believed _meta_end_dot_

 the gun went into his desk drawer and the reefer came out _meta_end_dot_

 did i ever report him to university officials _meta_end_question_

 no _meta_end_dot_

 did i re read and re write the assignment on kant _meta_end_question_

 yes _meta_end_dot_

 did i clean up my post vietnam act and quit feeling sorry for myself _meta_end_question_

 yes _meta_end_dot_

 i tell this story as a part of a collection i will tell over the next few days _meta_end_dot_

 stream of consciousness perhaps leading into the _meta_number_ref_th anniversary of the _meta_number_ref_ tet offensive _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_
