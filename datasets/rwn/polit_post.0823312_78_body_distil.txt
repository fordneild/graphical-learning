  jennifer lopez for allegedly saying that she couldn t understand why everyone is talking about that swimmer according to a gma source _meta_end_dot_

 she couldn t come up with eight time gold medal winner michael phelps name and then she yammered on about how she was the one training for a triathlon just six months after giving birth and how that was the big story right now not the swimmer in lopez s defense she can always claim she was misquoted unlike barack obama who definitely did say i have become a symbol of the possibility of america returning to our best traditions
