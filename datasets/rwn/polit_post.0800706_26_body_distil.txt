 on the other hand anybody who got into the senate by beating alan keyes and who hasn t yet served a full term isn t by any objective standard even qualified to be president _meta_end_dot_

 still america s most vapid politician a guy who should have had his presidential campaign sponsored by hallmark greeting cards because in a whole year s time i m not sure he said anything deeper than something you ve read on the back of one of those cards is now the favorite to be the democratic nominee _meta_end_dot_

 hillary s people have been trying to start fake whispering campaigns that the guy is secretly a muslim and a former coke dealer but they should be trying to get fabio and the let s get ready to rumble guy to endorse her campaign instead _meta_end_dot_

 why _meta_end_question_

 because the only two things obama has going for him are that he s nice looking and he has a great voice and maybe fabio and michael buffer combined could help hillary s campaign match barack strength for strength _meta_end_dot_

 defining quote the truth is that right after _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ i had a flag pin _meta_end_dot_

 shortly after _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ particularly because as we re talking about the iraq war that became a substitute for i think true patriotism which is speaking out on issues that are of importance to our national security barack obama explaining why he refuses to wear a flag pin defining picture barack obama doesn t bother raising his hand for the national anthem _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ cindy sheehan poor mother sheehan _meta_end_dot_

 this year she went from being the rosa parks of the anti war movement for criticizing bush to becoming persona non grata on the left for attacking democrats too _meta_end_dot_

 in fact the dems turned on her so completely that she was even banned from the daily kos after she decided to try to cry her way into nancy pelosi s congressional seat this year _meta_end_dot_

 but unlike those liberals i m a compassionate person which is why i decided to try to help cindy out by making a couple of campaign videos for her go cindy _meta_end_exclamation_

 still even though i am backing cindy sheehan in her run against nancy pelosi i do have to admit that she is rusty nails across a chalk board hit yourself in the face with a frying pan roseanne barr singing the national anthem annoying and thus deserves inclusion on this list _meta_end_dot_

 defining quote the collapse of the twin towers does look to me like a controlled demolition i m not an expert but it does look to me like a controlled demolition i m looking at common sense _meta_end_dot_

 i do see some very high profile people saying it was an inside job cindy sheehan _meta_number_ref_ michael moore i guess transparently dishonest propaganda doesn t sell as well as it used to because even though liberal film critics praised sicko to the skies it only grossed _meta_number_ref_ million at the box office as opposed to the cool _meta_number_ref_ mil that fahrenheit _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ raked in _meta_end_dot_

 not only did sicko contain all the lies and distortions people have come to expect from michael moore grotesquely he flacked for dictator fidel castro s horrific health care system in cuba during the film _meta_end_dot_

 even for a liberal like moore that s pretty embarrassing _meta_end_dot_

 defining video fred thompson helped gin up a hot following on the net by putting out this video declining michael moore s pathetic request for a debate and suggesting instead that moore should enter a mental institution _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ ted rall rall is a former winner of the most annoying liberal award and he s certainly still annoying as ever but as time has passed he has become more pathetic and irrelevant and you almost sense that he spews forth a little bile every so often primarily because it makes him feel like a big man to still have people complaining about him _meta_end_dot_

 with that in mind i could say more but rall s not important enough to merit anything further _meta_end_dot_

 defining quote over time however the endless war in iraq began to play a role in natural selection _meta_end_dot_

 only idiots signed up only idiots died _meta_end_dot_

 back home the average i q _meta_end_dot_

 soared ted rall _meta_number_ref_ jimmy carter it s hard to imagine what must have gone through george bush s head after he was called the worst president ever by a potus as hapless as jimmy carter _meta_end_dot_

 that s sort of like having michael vick accuse of you of not being a dog lover or having mahmoud ahmadinejad accuse you of being unfriendly to jews _meta_end_dot_

 and speaking of being unfriendly to jews _meta_number_ref_ members of jimmy carter s own carter center advisory board resigned in protest over his book palestine peace not apartheid which was nothing but a sloppy kiss to genocidal palestinian terrorists _meta_end_dot_

 of course that book was just par for the course for a wretched foolish petty little man who spends his days rhetorically attacking his own country while pandering to the worst sort of strong men and dictators around the world _meta_end_dot_

 it s terrifying to think that a naive simpleton like carter could have ever actually been the president of the united states _meta_end_dot_

 defining quote and i think the almost undeviating support by great britain for the ill advised policies of president bush in iraq have been a major tragedy for the world jimmy carter castigates the british for cooperating with his own country _meta_number_ref_ bill maher faux libertarian bill maher reminds me a lot of ann coulter well if ann coulter were liberal a guy much less talented not very insightful and could get away with pretty much anything _meta_end_dot_

 for example bill maher essentially got a free pass for saying i have zero doubt that if dick cheney was not in power people wouldn t be dying needlessly tomorrow i m just saying if he did die other people more people would live _meta_end_dot_

 that s a fact bill maher here s another one i love america it s americans i can t stand bill maher maher is an irritable rabidly anti christian unpleasant creep with a nasty attitude and this defining quote would seem to indicate there s not much difference between his private and public persona defining quote bill wants someone he can put down in an argument tell you how ghetto you are how big your butt is and that you re an idiot _meta_end_dot_

 that s why you never see him with a white girl or an intellectual _meta_end_dot_

 i might as well have been a muslim woman with my head wrapped walking _meta_number_ref_ paces behind my man _meta_end_dot_

 but i couldn t be bill maher s girlfriend any more not when i m karrine steffans _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 best selling author karrine steffans _meta_number_ref_ the huffington post imagine a slightly bigger version of the daily kos that featured c list celebrities saying incredibly dumb things instead of just random schmoes on the internet and you have arianna huffington s lazy eyed baby the huffington post _meta_end_dot_

 whether it s trashing the troops conspiracy theories or making merry after some republican goes to the hospital or dies the huffpo will be ready willing and able to meet your annoying liberal needs defining quote _meta_number_ref_ i propose a limitation be put on how many squares of toilet paper can be used in any one sitting _meta_end_dot_

 now i don t want to rob any law abiding american of his or her god given rights but i think we are an industrious enough people that we can make it work with only one square per restroom visit except of course on those pesky occasions where _meta_number_ref_ to _meta_number_ref_ could be required _meta_end_dot_

 when presenting this idea to my younger brother whose judgment i trust implicitly he proposed taking it one step further _meta_end_dot_

 i believe his quote was how bout just washing the one square out sheryl crow defining quote _meta_number_ref_ i hear about tony snow and say to myself well stand up every day lie to the american people at the behest of your dictator esque boss and well how could a cancer not grow in you _meta_end_dot_

 work for fox news spinning the truth in to a billion knots and how can your gut not rot _meta_end_question_

 i know it s terrible _meta_end_dot_

 i admit it _meta_end_dot_

 i don t wish anyone harm even tony snow _meta_end_dot_

 and i do hope he recovers or at least does what he feels is best and surrounds himself with friends and family for his journey _meta_end_dot_

 but in the back of my head there s justin timberlake s what goes around goes around comes around comes all the way back around ya charles karel bouley _meta_number_ref_ chris matthews there are a lot of unfathomable mysteries in life _meta_end_dot_

 like what the hell is wrong with britney spears does paris hilton s iq reach into triple digits and perhaps most importantly how does chris matthews show hardball stay on the air _meta_end_question_

 liberals don t like him _meta_end_dot_

 conservatives hold him in contempt _meta_end_dot_

 hardball not only gets bad ratings the show has been around for a decade so it isn t like it s just about to mature into a real hit _meta_end_dot_

 so how does chris matthews keep his job and does it involve his being the biggest suck up in the television news business or does it have more to do with his possession of embarrassing pictures of an msnbc executive at a tijuana whorehouse _meta_end_question_

 it s another one of those unfathomable mysteries _meta_end_dot_

 defining quote calling his show hardball is like rechristening ping pong thermonuclear warfare displays the slurred unmodulated speech and unfocused antagonism of an aggrieved middle management drunk _meta_end_dot_

 can read a scurrilous political attack into any paragraph at twenty paces _meta_end_dot_

 continues honing his pointless questions as his guests attempt to answer cutting them off with an affected imperial weariness when their responses are insufficiently inane _meta_end_dot_

 apparently ignorant of the implications of satellite technology matthews shouts louder at geographically more distant guests the beast _meta_number_ref_ geraldo rivera geraldo has exactly one skill he s willing to take monstrous risks to get a hot story _meta_end_dot_

 if you need a guy to wander into the middle of a bunch of brawling skinheads geraldo is your guy _meta_end_dot_

 if you want someone to go talk an aids infested addict who s threatening to stick people with his bloody needles geraldo will do it _meta_end_dot_

 if you want a person to try to interview people who are actually engaged in a house to house gunfight in afghanistan have geraldo on speed dial _meta_end_dot_

 however as you d expect anyone with that mentality is either insanely brave or an airheaded ditz and geraldo falls into the latter category which makes him come across like a moron when he actually tries to give his opinion on a subject as opposed to just describing things he s watching happen in front of him _meta_end_dot_

 the worst example of this is on illegal immigration where geraldo is so rabidly pro illegal that he would probably favor driving americans out of the southern half of the united states to make more room for people who might want to sneak into the country _meta_end_dot_

 defining video geraldo s screaming match over illegal immigration with bill o reilly _meta_end_dot_

 defining quote it s good michelle malkin s in d c _meta_end_dot_

 and i m in new york _meta_end_dot_

 i d spit on her if i saw her geraldo rivera _meta_number_ref_ john edwards silky pony may be america s least authentic politician _meta_end_dot_

 he talks about america as if we re in the midst of a depression and he s constantly promising to represent the little guy against the rich special interests which is about as good a description as you re ever going to get of him since he s a filthy rich trial lawyer who caters to the unions _meta_end_dot_

 meanwhile in between his national poverty tours and pleas for america to help the legions of starving street urchins we apparently have in this country who can t afford _meta_dollor_ref_ coats at wal mart edwards is living in a mansion and getting _meta_dollor_ref_ haircuts _meta_end_dot_

 then there was the time that he had his sick wife call hardball to attack coulter for beating up on him for being a pantywaist which incidentally just enforced that impression _meta_end_dot_

 worst of all there was the time the breck girl s campaign encouraged people to send his wife sympathy notes because of her cancer and then sent fund raising emails out to all of those people _meta_end_dot_

 there s nothing quite like cynically exploiting your own wife s illnes to collect a few extra bucks for your political campaign _meta_end_dot_

 defining quote if by running feud you mean the way edwards cries every time i make a joke about him yes i think that has not made him seem more commander in chief like to most voters _meta_end_dot_

 i predict he s going to have a bad hair day in iowa and another one in new hampshire ann coulter on her feud with john edwards _meta_number_ref_ mike malloy if you ever want to know why liberal talk radio hasn t caught on look at mike malloy _meta_end_dot_

 rush limbaugh and sean hannity get accused of being angry because they re tough on the democrats but you can almost picture malloy secretly murdering republicans on the week ends and burying them in the crawlspace under his house _meta_end_dot_

 of course when a guy is too furiously radical for even air america to take it is a pretty good indication that he s off the charts wacko enough to say things like defining quote _meta_number_ref_ i used to have violence fantasies about scott mcclellan because of the impenetrable wall of idiocy and supposed ignorance some of which was probably not supposed that behind which he used to hide at every press conference _meta_end_dot_

 all those feelings are being shifted now to dana perino violence fantasies mike malloy defining quote _meta_number_ref_ drudge _meta_end_question_

 aw drudge somebody ought to wrap a strong republican entrail around his neck and hoist him up about six feet in the air and watch him bounce mike malloy _meta_number_ref_ the daily kos the funny thing about the daily kos is that the farther out there they get the more thoroughly they seem to be mainstreamed into the democratic party _meta_end_dot_

 last year democratic contenders for the presidency like hillary clinton barack obama and john edwards went to the yearly kos convention to kiss the rings of kossacks and daily kos founder markos moulitsas got a gig writing for newsweek _meta_end_dot_

 meanwhile here s the sort of things that was being posted by the diarists on the daily kos defining quote _meta_number_ref_ so to sum up i don t like our troops i don t like what they re doing i don t like their fat whining families and yet i support them _meta_end_dot_

 thank god i live in a free country _meta_end_dot_

 thank you awhitneybrown defining quote _meta_number_ref_ i wrote a diary a short time ago about how the bush administration helped ruin my marriage _meta_end_dot_

 it wasn t because my husband was a bush supporter or anything it was because of all the stresses from job loses living without health insurance and getting sick to my husband being forced to take a job where he wasn t home much that helped ruin my marriage angrybird defining quote _meta_number_ref_ i know i m a jewish lesbian and ahmadinejad would probably have me killed _meta_end_dot_

 but still the guy speaks some blunt truths about the bush administration that make me swoon _meta_end_dot_

 okay i admit it _meta_end_dot_

 part of it is that he just looks cuddly _meta_end_dot_

 possibly cuddly enough to turn me straight _meta_end_dot_

 i think he kind of looks like kermit the frog _meta_end_dot_

 sort of _meta_end_dot_

 with smaller eyes _meta_end_dot_

 but that s not all sallykohn _meta_number_ref_ joy behar after rosie o donnell left the view you had to figure that whoopi golberg would take over for her in the annoying hate filled conspiracy mongering department but instead it was joy behar who filled the gap _meta_end_dot_

 last year the whole show made the list but this year behar was so singularly awful that she deserves to be personally recognized for her work _meta_end_dot_

 on the other hand maybe i m just laying off the show because if the vast right wing conspiracy wanted to discredit the left there would be no better way to do it than to put _meta_number_ref_ braindead yammering liberal yentas together with one token conservative in front of a large audience every day _meta_end_dot_

 i mean you have to think that having people regularly listen to this sort of drivel from joy behar almost can t help but aid conservatives defining quote _meta_number_ref_ i don t know what it s going to take for people to really wake up and understand that they the bush administration are liars and they are murderers joy behar defining quote _meta_number_ref_ is there such a thing as a man made stroke _meta_end_question_

 in other words did someone do this to democratic senator tim johnson _meta_end_question_

 i know what this republican party is capable of joy behar _meta_number_ref_ al sharpton in recent years al sharpton has surpassed jesse jackson to become america s race hustler in chief _meta_end_dot_

 if there is money to be made or media coverage to be had playing black and white people against each other you can be sure that al sharpton will be right in the middle of it mugging for the cameras and trying to find a way to make a few bucks _meta_end_dot_

 this year he managed to latch on to the jena six case which featured _meta_number_ref_ thugs knocking a kid unconscious from behind and trying to stomp him to death until they were pulled off of him _meta_end_dot_

 if that was the only information you had you might think that sharpton was standing up for the kid who was savagely attacked but no sharpton being sharpton was agitating for the six people who launched the assault _meta_end_dot_

 his other big accomplishments were having don imus and dog the bounty hunter publicly ask him for help after they upset racial sensibilities _meta_end_dot_

 in both cases sharpton gleefully made a big show of their requests for his forgiveness and then ultimately hung them out to dry _meta_end_dot_

 defining quote i can t think of a time when the rev _meta_end_dot_

 sharpton wasn t under investigation al sharpton s lawyer michael hardy after a fbi and irs investigation into sharpton was launched _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ al gore just when you thought nothing could make al gore more pompous after the tongue bathing he has gotten from liberals begging him to run for president the nobel peace prize committee bizarrely decided to give him an award for spreading alarmist propaganda about global warming _meta_end_dot_

 does it mean that no one is doing anything to promote peace these days or that al gore talked some people who had seen an inconvenient truth one too many times into holding the judges families hostage until they promised to vote him in _meta_end_question_

 either way al gore s still a jerk _meta_end_dot_

 defining quote _meta_number_ref_ in order for an inconvenient truth to be shown the british government must first amend their guidance notes to teachers to make clear that _meta_number_ref_ the film is a political work and promotes only one side of the argument _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ if teachers present the film without making this plain they may be in breach of section _meta_number_ref_ of the education act _meta_number_ref_ and guilty of political indoctrination _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ eleven inaccuracies have to be specifically drawn to the attention of school children newsbusters covers an inconvenient truth being officially declared to be full of lies by a british court defining quote _meta_number_ref_ we are what is wrong and we must make it right al gore accidentally hitting closer to the mark than he realized in his nobel peace prize acceptance speech _meta_number_ref_ keith olbermann last year s winner of the most annoying liberal of _meta_number_ref_ award keith olbermann has managed to make a good living out of looking serious on tv pretending to be a real newscaster and then spewing the same bilge as the netroots kooks who go home every night to their moms basements and watch michael moore s fahrenheit _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ or _meta_number_ref_ times _meta_end_dot_

 moreover olbermann is insufferably arrogant as ever and as one of my commenters said not only does he spread his untruths and bile on a nationally broadcast news show now he s invaded the sacrosanct realm of sunday football despite his popularity olbermann is only attached to reality by the most tenuous of threads as this defining quote shows you defining quote al qaeda really hurt us but not as much as rupert murdoch has hurt us particularly in the case of fox news _meta_end_dot_

 fox news is worse than al qaeda worse for our society _meta_end_dot_

 it s as dangerous as the ku klux klan ever was keith olbermann _meta_number_ref_ nancy pelosi san fran nan has been such a horrible speaker of the house that she has led the democratic congress to the single lowest approval rating in history _meta_end_dot_

 the first female speaker has been so bad and so dare i say it annoying that she s like a living breathing argument against electing hillary clinton as the first woman president _meta_end_dot_

 defining picture beyond leading democrats in congress to their lowest approval rating in history nancy pelosi s other notable achievement was being used as a propaganda tool by chinless syrian despot bashar assad who was probably scratching his head trying to figure out what the hell she thought she was accomplishing by puttering around in his country _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ harry reid reid spent the year helping to drive down the approval ratings of democrats in the senate doing everything he could to undermine the effort to win the war in iraq trying to line his pockets in corrupt real estate deals and generally making even other democrats cringe in embarrassment that they re being led around by such a mopey jackass _meta_end_dot_

 reid is a sleazy nasty tempered liberal who puts petty political concerns in front of everything else including the troops in iraq and he s a walking talking embodiment of what people like the least about the democratic party _meta_end_dot_

 defining quote now i believe myself that the secretary of state the secretary of defense and you have to make your own decision as to what the president knows that this war is lost that the surge is not accomplishing anything harry reid _meta_number_ref_ rosie o donnell the employees at msnbc should count their lucky stars because if they had actually ended up hiring rosie and putting her on the air after keith olbermann it would have undoubtedly created a black hole of liberal idiocy so powerful that it might have ruptured the very fabric of reality _meta_end_dot_

 over the course of last year rosie told a pitiful story about how the world s most insincere man bill clinton made her cry hysterically by saying i m sorry for all the men who ever hurt you i m sorry that i hurt you she wondered why anyone would want to enlist in the military _meta_end_dot_

 she called george bush a war criminal at a fundraiser for the for all kids foundation then there was the time she implied that we had engineered the iranian capture of british sailors as an excuse to go to war i could go on but let s just call it an extensive laundry list of stupidity and leave it at that with the exception of my favorite rosie quote from last year defining quote i do believe that it s the first time in history that fire has ever melted steel _meta_end_dot_

 i do believe that it defies physics that world trade center tower _meta_number_ref_ building _meta_number_ref_ which collapsed in on itself it is impossible for a building to fall the way it fell without explosives being involved _meta_end_dot_

 world trade center _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 world trade center _meta_number_ref_ and _meta_number_ref_ got hit by planes _meta_number_ref_ miraculously the first time in history steel was melted by fire _meta_end_dot_

 it is physically impossible rosie o donnell _meta_number_ref_ hillary clinton blessedly until last year people had started to forget all the things they disliked about the clintons but having the glacier in the public eye for an entire year brought it all back like some sort of acid flashback from hell _meta_end_dot_

 the arrogance _meta_end_dot_

 the bald faced lies _meta_end_dot_

 the sleazy attempts to destroy the political opponents of the clintons obama in this case _meta_end_dot_

 the grotesque clintonesque sense of entitlement to special treatment from the media _meta_end_dot_

 ugh _meta_end_dot_

 then there was her robotic heavily scripted goresque personality _meta_end_dot_

 you could almost imagine some scriptwriter telling her ok hillary at this point give a warm chuckle because that s what we humans do after we say something like that moreover her campaign was simply ridiculous _meta_end_dot_

 she spent most of the year claiming to have a wealth of experience because she was married to the guy making decisions for _meta_number_ref_ years which is an incredibly silly argument _meta_end_dot_

 if you don t think so then next time you re going in to have surgery done ask yourself if you d allow the surgeon s wife to cut you open because of all the experience she gained by being married to him for _meta_number_ref_ years _meta_end_dot_

 then after the polls indicated that change was beating experience she started claiming to be the agent of change in the democratic race which was a hard sell with her husband and half his cabinet from the nineties floating around in her general vicinity helping out with her campaign _meta_end_dot_

 whether or not hillary will be the democratic nominee in _meta_number_ref_ is still unknown but if someone as annoying as the wicked witch of new york gets into office it s going to be a rough four years for the country _meta_end_dot_

 defining video hillary s infamous fake cackle _meta_end_dot_

 defining quote i think the fact of the matter is that sen _meta_end_dot_

 clinton is claiming basically the entire eight years of the clinton presidency as her own except for the stuff that didn t work out in which case she says she has nothing to do with it _meta_end_dot_

 there is no doubt that bill clinton had faith in her and consulted with her on issues in the same way that i would consult with michelle if there were issues _meta_end_dot_

 on the other hand i don t think michelle would claim that she is the best qualified person to be a united states senator by virtue of me talking to her on occasion about the work i ve done barack obama also see the twenty most annoying liberals in the united states the _meta_number_ref_ edition the twenty most annoying liberals in the united states the _meta_number_ref_ edition the twenty most annoying liberals in the united states the _meta_number_ref_ edition the twenty most annoying liberals in the united states the _meta_number_ref_ edition the twenty most annoying liberals in the united states the _meta_number_ref_ edition
