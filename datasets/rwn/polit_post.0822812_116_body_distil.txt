  so the little chinese chick was lip syncing a _meta_number_ref_ year old chinese girl was not good looking enough for the olympics opening ceremony so another little girl with a pixie smile lip synched ode to the motherland a ceremony official said _ the latest example of the lengths beijing took for a perfect start to the summer games _meta_end_dot_

 a member of china s politburo asked for the last minute change to match one girl s face with another s voice the ceremony s chief music director chen qigang said in an interview with beijing radio _meta_end_dot_

 the audience will understand that it s in the national interest chen said in a video of the interview posted online sunday night _meta_end_dot_

 and then there are the prepubescent and by prepubescent i mean _meta_number_ref_ year old child athletes last night we watched a group of _meta_number_ref_ year old chinese girls beat the crap out of the american gymnasts _meta_end_dot_

 and please _meta_end_dot_

 don t try to tell me those chinese chicks are _meta_number_ref_ and older _meta_end_dot_

 bela karolyi is not crazy actually i think he might be for other reasons but he s right about this _meta_end_dot_

 even the new york times and time magazine and sports illustrated are getting on it and there s pretty convincing proof that there are some serious shenanigans going on with that shit _meta_end_dot_

 oh and then there s the whole we don t the whole country just the separatists part bit by our good friend vladamir putin _meta_end_dot_

 oh and it s dick cheney s fault _meta_beep_ref_ russians were told over breakfast yesterday what really happened in georgia the conflict in south ossetia was part of a plot by dick cheney the vice president to stop barack obama being elected president of the united states _meta_end_dot_

 the line came on the main news of vesti fm a state radio station that like the government and much of russia s media has reverted to the old habits of soviet years in which a sinister american hand was held to lie behind every conflict especially those embarrassing to moscow _meta_end_dot_

 modern russia may be plugged into the internet and the global marketplace but in the battle for world opinion the kremlin is replaying the old black and white movie _meta_end_dot_

 the obama angle is getting wide play _meta_end_dot_

 it was aired on wednesday by sergei markov a senior political scientist who is close to vladimir putin the prime minister and power behind president medvedev _meta_end_dot_

 i never could understand bush when he said that he looked into putin s soul _meta_end_dot_

 good grief _meta_end_dot_

 i looked in and saw a hungry wolf waiting to eat his prey _meta_end_dot_

 and he s started his meal _meta_end_dot_

 communists lie that s what they do _meta_end_dot_

 they distort things and defend distortions for the greater good _meta_end_dot_

 they make decisions for expedience and their own comfort _meta_end_dot_

 to promote the state they don t mind harming the individual _meta_end_dot_

 they do not value the individual except inasmuch as the individual can make the state look good _meta_end_dot_

 and still liberals defend this _meta_end_dot_

 the preach peace when peace means appeasement _meta_end_dot_

 it s tiring _meta_end_dot_

 i agree in part with michael reagan s assessment in any struggle between the dreamers and the realists the realists always win _meta_end_dot_

 we re seeing that played out right now as the supreme realist of our time vladimir putin not only is running circles around the dreamers of the west but is also making them look like a bunch of incompetent ninnies _meta_end_dot_

 we in the west buy the commies lies because the truth is too difficult to contemplate more war _meta_end_dot_

 the fact is that these powers understand one thing dominance _meta_end_dot_

 and america s continued slide into socialistic softness has opened the door for tyrants worldwide _meta_end_dot_

 ultimately the constitution of the average american enables a guy like putin and the republic of china _meta_end_dot_

 we don t have the stomach for a fight _meta_end_dot_
