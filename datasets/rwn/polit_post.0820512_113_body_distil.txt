  n ever thought i d write that in a title _meta_end_dot_

 here is obama being interviewed by katie couric squirming and shuffling about the surge katie couric cbs before the surge as you know senator there were _meta_number_ref_ to _meta_number_ref_ u s _meta_end_dot_

 casualties a month the country was rife with sectarian violence and you raised a lot of eyebrows on this trip saying even knowing what you know now you still would not have supported the surge _meta_end_dot_

 people may be scratching their heads and saying why barack obama well _meta_end_dot_

 because _meta_end_dot_

 what i was referring to and i ve consistently referred to is the need for a strategy that actually concludes our involvement in iraq and moves iraqis to take responsibility for the country _meta_end_dot_

 couric but didn t the surge _meta_end_dot_

 obama and _meta_end_dot_

 couric help do that _meta_end_question_

 obama let me finish katie _meta_end_dot_

 what happens is that if we continue to put _meta_dollor_ref_ billion to _meta_dollor_ref_ billion a month into iraq if we are willing to send as many troops as we can muster continually into iraq _meta_end_question_

 there s no doubt that that s gonna have an impact _meta_end_dot_

 but it doesn t meet our long term strategic goal which is to make the american people safer over the long term _meta_end_dot_

 if that means that we re detracting from our efforts in afghanistan where conditions are deteriorating if it means that we are distracted from going after osama bin laden who is still sending out audio tapes and is operating training camps where we know terrorists actions are being plotted _meta_end_dot_

 if we have shifted away from the central front of terrorism as a consequence of enormous and continuing investments in iraq then that s a poor strategic choice _meta_end_dot_

 and ultimately what we ve got to do is we have to recognize that iraq is just one of our _meta_end_dot_

 security problems _meta_end_dot_

 it s not the only one _meta_end_dot_

 we ve got big problems in afghanistan _meta_end_dot_

 we ve got a significant threat in iran _meta_end_dot_

 we ve got to deal with pakistan and the fact that there are safe havens there _meta_end_dot_

 those are all the factors and all the issues that i ve gotta take into account when i m president of the united states _meta_end_dot_

 couric all that may be true _meta_end_dot_

 but do you not give the surge any credit for reducing violence in iraq _meta_end_question_

 obama no no _meta_end_dot_

 of course i have _meta_end_dot_

 there is no doubt that the extraordinary work of our u s _meta_end_dot_

 forces has contributed to a lessening of the violence just as making sure that the sadr militia stood down or the fact that the sunni tribes decided to flip and work with us instead of with al qaeda something that we hadn t anticipated happening _meta_end_dot_

 all those things have contributed to a reduction in violence _meta_end_dot_

 so this in no way detracts from the great efforts of our young men and women in uniform _meta_end_dot_

 in fact that s one of the most striking things about visiting iraq is to see how dedicated they are what a great job they do all those things _meta_end_dot_

 are critically important _meta_end_dot_

 what i m saying is it does not solve the broader strategic question that we have been dealing with over the last five six seven years _meta_end_dot_

 and that is how do we take the limited resources we have both militarily and financially and apply them in such a way that we are making america as safe as possible _meta_end_question_

 and i believe that my approach is the right one _meta_end_dot_

 couric but talking microcosmically did the surge the addition of _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ additional troops _meta_end_dot_

 help the situation in iraq _meta_end_question_

 obama katie as _meta_end_dot_

 you ve asked me three different times and i have said repeatedly that there is no doubt that our troops helped to reduce violence _meta_end_dot_

 there s no doubt _meta_end_dot_

 couric but yet you re saying _meta_end_dot_

 given what you know now you still wouldn t support it _meta_end_dot_

 so i m just trying to understand this _meta_end_dot_

 obama because _meta_end_dot_

 it s pretty straightforward _meta_end_dot_

 by us putting _meta_dollor_ref_ billion to _meta_dollor_ref_ billion a month _meta_dollor_ref_ billion that s money that could have gone into afghanistan _meta_end_dot_

 those additional troops could have gone into afghanistan _meta_end_dot_

 that money also could have been used to shore up a declining economic situation in the united states _meta_end_dot_

 that money could have been applied to having a serious energy security plan so that we were reducing our demand on oil which is helping to fund the insurgents in many countries _meta_end_dot_

 so those are all factors that would be taken into consideration in my decision to deal with a specific tactic or strategy inside of iraq _meta_end_dot_

 couric and i really don t mean to belabor this senator because i m really i m trying _meta_end_dot_

 to figure out your position _meta_end_dot_

 do you think the level of security in iraq _meta_end_dot_

 obama yes _meta_end_dot_

 couric _meta_end_dot_

 would exist today without the surge _meta_end_question_

 obama katie i have no idea what would have happened had we applied my approach which was to put more pressure on the iraqis to arrive at a political reconciliation _meta_end_dot_

 so this is all hypotheticals _meta_end_dot_

 what i can say is that there s no doubt that our u s _meta_end_dot_

 troops have contributed to a reduction of violence in iraq _meta_end_dot_

 i said that not just today not just yesterday but i ve said that previously _meta_end_dot_

 what that doesn t change is that we ve got to have a different strategic approach if we re going to make america as safe as possible _meta_end_dot_

 just can t bring himself to admit it about the surge can he _meta_end_question_

 by the way a flashback to january of this year when supposedly the hypothetical was reality and obama gave himself and democrats credit for the surge s success during one of the debates what we have to do is to begin a phased redeployment to send a clear signal to the iraqi government that we are not going to be there in perpetuity _meta_end_dot_

 now it will we should be as careful getting out as we were careless getting in _meta_end_dot_

 i welcome the genuine reductions of violence that have taken place although i would point out that much of that violence has been reduced because there was an agreement with tribes in anbar province sunni tribes who started to see after the democrats were elected in _meta_number_ref_ you know what the americans may be leaving soon and we are going to be left very vulnerable to the shi as _meta_end_dot_

 we should start negotiating now _meta_end_dot_

 that s how you change behavior _meta_end_dot_

 what a load of camel dung _meta_end_dot_

 lord keynes once famously said when the facts change i change my mind _meta_end_dot_

 what do you do sir what obama does is practice avoidance and does so through the age old political device of doggedly sticking to his talking points in the face of the obvious reality of the situation _meta_end_dot_

 character _meta_end_dot_

 integrity _meta_end_dot_

 there it is in abundance huh _meta_end_question_
