  on a semi regular basis throughout the year rwn has posted quotes of the day _meta_end_dot_

 here are my favorite _meta_number_ref_ quotes of the day for _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ this is leftism s great strength it s all white lies _meta_end_dot_

 that s its only advantage as far as i can tell _meta_end_dot_

 none of its programs actually works after all _meta_end_dot_

 from statism and income redistribution to liberalized criminal laws and multiculturalism from its assault on religion to its redefinition of family leftist policies have made the common life worse wherever they re installed _meta_end_dot_

 but because it depends on indeed is defined by describing the human condition inaccurately leftism is nothing if not polite _meta_end_dot_

 with its tortuous attempts to rename unpleasant facts out of existence he s not crippled dear he s handicapped it s not a slum it s an inner city it s not surrender it s redeployment leftism has outlived its own failure by hiding itself within the most labyrinthine construct of social delicacy since victoria was queen andrew klavan _meta_number_ref_ the total military dead in the iraq war between _meta_number_ref_ and this month stands at about _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 this is tragic as are all deaths due to war and we are facing a cowardly enemy unlike any other in our past that hides behind innocent citizens _meta_end_dot_

 each death is blazoned in the headlines of newspapers and internet sites _meta_end_dot_

 what is never compared is the number of military deaths during the clinton administration _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 that s _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ deaths in peacetime but of course who s counting alicia colon _meta_number_ref_ hillary wants to be the first woman president which would also make her the first woman in a clinton administration to sit behind the desk in the oval office instead of under it ann coulter _meta_number_ref_ people have been calling for national dialogues and conversations for decades _meta_end_dot_

 it usually works something like this liberals say we need a frank discussion about race or class or gender in this country and then they proceed to bludgeon any conservative stupid enough to take them up on their offer jonah goldberg _meta_number_ref_ a measure of hypocrisy is necessary to a functioning society _meta_end_dot_

 it s quite possible on the one hand to be opposed to the legalization of prostitution yet on the other to pull your hat down over your brow every other tuesday and sneak off to the cat house on the other side of town _meta_end_dot_

 your inability to live up to your own standards does not in and of itself nullify them _meta_end_dot_

 the left gives the impression that a republican senator caught in a whorehouse ought immediately to say you re right _meta_end_dot_

 i should have supported earmarks for hookers in the _meta_number_ref_ appropriations bill that s the reason why sex scandals take down republicans but not democrats sex wise the left s standards are that whatever s your bag is cool which is the equivalent of no standards _meta_end_dot_

 thus monica lewinsky was a grown woman free to make her own decisions on the carpet of the oval office _meta_end_dot_

 without agreed moral standards all you have is the law _meta_end_dot_

 when it s no longer clear something is wrong all you can do is make it illegal mark steyn _meta_number_ref_ sen _meta_end_dot_

 hillary clinton declared this weekend i m in to win anyone who has watched her remarkable trajectory can have no doubt that she ll do whatever it takes to win the presidency _meta_end_dot_

 i wish she felt the same way about the war liz cheney _meta_number_ref_ when conservatives talk about supporting the troops they mean doing everything possible to help them win the war they re fighting _meta_end_dot_

 liberals never seem to talk about victory but rather see support as turning soldiers and veterans into another victim group dependent on government health and welfare services _meta_end_dot_

 will it work _meta_end_question_

 so far at least i think a large majority of our service personnel think of themselves as warriors rather than participants in a social welfare program _meta_end_dot_

 but there is a certain logic to the democrats approach if one s only concern is the safety of the troops the simple solution is never to fight _meta_end_dot_

 and if like most liberals you have no intention of ever fighting then you might as well take credit for keeping the troops safe _meta_end_dot_

 but that isn t what most americans or most soldiers have in mind when they think of an effective military john hinderaker _meta_number_ref_ for the less enthusiastically obstructive nato members ally means wealthy country with no military capability that requires years of diplomatic wooing and black tie banquets in order to agree to a token contribution of _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ troops incidentally that _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ isn t artistic licence on my part _meta_end_dot_

 the _meta_number_ref_ nato summit in turkey was presented as a triumph of multilateral co operation because the _meta_number_ref_ members agreed to contribute between them an additional _meta_number_ref_ troops and three helicopters to the afghan mission _meta_end_dot_

 that s _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ troops and a ninth of a helicopter per ally _meta_end_dot_

 in fairness turkey chipped in the three helicopters single handed though the deal required them to return to ankara after three months mark steyn _meta_number_ref_ i used to believe that people got more religious when they got older because they were getting closer to death and they felt they needed to hedge their bets _meta_end_dot_

 and i felt that people got more conservative as they got older because they got richer and wanted to keep more of their money _meta_end_dot_

 then when i got older and became both of the above i came to realize that while that s true with a great many people there was an alternate explanation that i would like to believe is true in my case and those of many others _meta_end_dot_

 you become more spiritual and more religious because you realize nothing else works _meta_end_dot_

 and if you live a life like i have you tried everything else _meta_end_dot_

 i m the only guy that had to go to a _meta_number_ref_ step program to get over bill clinton _meta_end_dot_

 and you become more conservative not because you become more selfish but because you keep the ideals that you had in your earlier years _meta_end_dot_

 but you realize that the way to achieve them is not the straight ahead path that the left suggests but the smart path that the right suggests dick morris _meta_number_ref_ i think the fact of the matter is that sen _meta_end_dot_

 clinton is claiming basically the entire eight years of the clinton presidency as her own except for the stuff that didn t work out in which case she says she has nothing to do with it _meta_end_dot_

 there is no doubt that bill clinton had faith in her and consulted with her on issues in the same way that i would consult with michelle if there were issues _meta_end_dot_

 on the other had i don t think michelle would claim that she is the best qualified person to be a united states senator by virtue of me talking to her on occasion about the work i ve done barack obama _meta_number_ref_ if _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ was really an inside job you wouldn t be driving around with a bumper sticker bragging that you were on to it _meta_end_dot_

 fantasy is a by product of security it s the difference between hanging upside down in your dominatrix s bondage parlor after work on friday and enduring the real thing for years on end in saddam s prisons mark steyn _meta_number_ref_ folks i m just going to tell you something _meta_end_dot_

 if cheap unskilled labor is what this country needs to continue to be the major player in the world that it is if cheap unskilled labor is precisely the key to continued prosperity and economic growth and the maintenance of our superpower status then mexico ought to be right behind us because they lead the world in it _meta_end_dot_

 every nation that has cheap unskilled labor ought to be threatening our status as world superpower _meta_end_dot_

 i ve never heard anything more absurd _meta_end_dot_

 i have never heard anything more insulting that without cheap labor we can t survive as we have always known the united states to be rush limbaugh _meta_number_ref_ just think of left wing logic like this _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ x _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 then get really mad about it _meta_end_exclamation_

 once you can do that you will be able to understand them don_cos _meta_number_ref_ it looks like the soviet approach to science is taking over the us now _meta_end_dot_

 climate scientists are going to have to choose sides in scientific debates based not on empirical evidence subjected to the scientific method but on whether they want to succeed in their careers _meta_end_dot_

 want a life _meta_end_question_

 say global warming is real _meta_end_dot_

 want to end up working as a substitute science teacher _meta_end_question_

 say what you really think steve h _meta_end_dot_

 hog on ice _meta_number_ref_ when one becomes a liberal he or she pretends to advocate tolerance equality and peace but hilariously they re doing so for purely selfish reasons _meta_end_dot_

 it s the human equivalent of a puppy dog s face an evolutionary tool designed to enhance survival reproductive value and status _meta_end_dot_

 in short liberalism is based on one central desire to look cool in front of others in order to get love _meta_end_dot_

 preaching tolerance makes you look cooler than saying something like please lower my taxes this is why the only true form of rebellion left on this planet is conservatism _meta_end_dot_

 conservatism by rejecting the trademark forms of romantic rebellion anarchy activism nipple rings turns out to be far more subversive than anything on the planet _meta_end_dot_

 the conservative every day knows that he or she says things that aren t considered cool among the media elite _meta_end_dot_

 yet the conservative still comes out and says it _meta_end_dot_

 this is why dick cheney is closer to the hell s angels than hunter s _meta_end_dot_

 thompson ever could be greg gutfeld also see rwn s favorite _meta_number_ref_ quotes of the day for _meta_number_ref_
