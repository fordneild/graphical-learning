  you had to figure that the san franfreakshow comical s mark morford the quintessential left wing bigot would be a fan of someone who would earn the sobriquet barack o bigot _meta_end_dot_

 but morford s slavish worship of the empty skin dems have chosen as their affirmative action nominee would embarrass even chris matthews _meta_end_dot_

 slobbers morford barack obama isn t really one of us _meta_end_dot_

 not in the normal way anyway _meta_end_dot_

 no it s not merely his youthful vigor or handsomeness or even inspiring rhetoric _meta_end_dot_

 it is not fresh ideas or cool charisma or the fact that a black president will be historic and revolutionary in about a thousand different ways _meta_end_dot_

 it is something more _meta_end_dot_

 even bill clinton with all his effortless winking charm didn t have what obama has which is a sort of powerful luminosity a unique high vibration integrity _meta_end_dot_

 what _meta_end_question_

 but it gets worse many spiritually advanced people i know not coweringly religious mind you but deeply spiritual identify obama as a lightworker that rare kind of attuned being who has the ability to lead us not merely to new foreign policies or health care plans or whatnot but who can actually help usher in a new way of being on the planet of relating and connecting and engaging with this bizarre earthly experiment _meta_end_dot_

 these kinds of people actually help us evolve _meta_end_dot_

 they are philosophers and peacemakers of a very high order and they speak not just to reason or emotion but to the soul _meta_end_dot_

 shovel down through the flaky b s _meta_end_dot_

 to morford s core message and it s just what obama s nasty wife has been screaming o bigot is going to demand that you shed your cynicism _meta_end_dot_

 that you put down your divisions _meta_end_dot_

 that you come out of your isolation that you move out of your comfort zones _meta_end_dot_

 that you push yourselves to be better _meta_end_dot_

 and that you engage _meta_end_dot_

 barack will never allow you to go back to your lives as usual uninvolved uninformed _meta_end_dot_

 they don t want a president _meta_end_dot_

 they want a totalitarian dictator who will remake every aspect of human existence in accordance with coercive moonbattery a cross between stalin and the antichrist _meta_end_dot_

 moonbats will be disappointed to learn that obama is not the antichrist or even stalin but just a mediocre left wing kook who has been aggressively marketed by an increasingly radical media establishment that picked him for his muslim name and skin color _meta_end_dot_

 liberals cheesy empty god _meta_end_dot_
