  cafepress is one of the exhibitors at cpac and according to them voters are buying _meta_number_ref_ times more anti hillary tees buttons bumpers and other products than all anti gop products combined _meta_end_dot_

 also it s interesting to note that t shirt sales seem to track with political upsurges _meta_end_dot_

 for example on _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ hillary and obama had about the same number of pro t shirt sales _meta_end_dot_

 after that obama s sales nearly doubled while hillary s dropped by about a third _meta_end_dot_

 on the republican side surprisingly mccain supporters outspent their romney counterparts by double in the cafepress com tee shirt presidential primary on the downside it looks like hillary and barack are way outselling mccain and romney so if tee shirts actually predict anything the gop is in a lot of trouble _meta_end_dot_
