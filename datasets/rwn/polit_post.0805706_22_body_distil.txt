  later tonight at _meta_number_ref_ pm est i ll be liveblogging the democratic debate _meta_end_dot_

 if you re going to be watching make sure to head over to rwn refresh to read the commentary and feel free to write a few words in the comments section _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ i am so not looking forward to this _meta_end_dot_

 hillary and barack s debates are usually so deadly dull _meta_end_dot_

 even if there are some juicy parts they will be surrounded by lots of yawniness _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ what _meta_end_question_

 no posing for pictures for _meta_number_ref_ minutes _meta_end_question_

 cnn needs to explain to them how to run things _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ give em hell hill _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ hillary i need to defend myself from obama s dirty attacks and point out the difference between the two of us _meta_end_dot_

 course that s hillary s problem there aren t many differences between them and so people are going almost solely on charisma where obama has her beat _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ hillary s people putting out that photo _meta_end_question_

 nooooooooooo _meta_end_exclamation_

 she would never lie about such a thing _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ barack let s get back into the weeds on the same minor difference between our health care plans that we have absolutely beaten into the ground over the last three debates _meta_end_dot_

 this is the equivalent of the old four corners strategy in college basketball _meta_end_dot_

 waste time on something nobody cares much about so that hill can t take chunks out of obama _meta_end_dot_

 we haven t whined about negative calls and emails didn t you just do that obama _meta_end_question_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ hillary s biggest problem in these debates _meta_end_question_

 believe it or not she s just not aggressive enough _meta_end_dot_

 obama has so many enormous weaknesses and she just doesn t have the chutzpa to hit them _meta_end_dot_

 maybe that will change tonight _meta_end_dot_

 speaking of which she said part of obama s plan could have been written by republicans _meta_end_question_

 that s a lowblow for democrats _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ barack blah blah blah socialized medicine wonk stuff _meta_end_dot_

 you know despite all the rah rah about his charisma obama is not a good debater _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ obama is getting p o d as hillary slaps him around a little bit _meta_end_dot_

 he s coming across as arrogant there shaking his head interrupting getting a little flustered _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ hillary is just plowing through trying to get the last word _meta_end_dot_

 obama is still looking like a pretentious jerk who s aggravated that someone dare to interrupt him _meta_end_dot_

 doesn t she know he s the obamamessiah _meta_end_question_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ i love it _meta_end_exclamation_

 hill is feisty tonight _meta_end_exclamation_

 complaining about getting the first question _meta_end_dot_

 talking about how the media is sucking up to obama _meta_end_dot_

 she is making him look like a lightweight _meta_end_dot_

 she is also ripping nafta _meta_end_dot_

 can t agree _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ obama she hasn t always been against nafta _meta_end_dot_

 she used to support it _meta_end_dot_

 she has shifted positions on this _meta_end_dot_

 i was always against it of course obama wasn t in congress then where he would have probably voted present any way on the issue _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ russert hillary your husband pushed the bill _meta_end_dot_

 you talked it up _meta_end_dot_

 they got her there _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ russert has caught hill in a lie basically _meta_end_dot_

 you used to love nafta now you don t _meta_end_question_

 what s up _meta_end_question_

 in six months hillary would be willing to opt out of nafta if they don t change it _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ woah russert pointed out obama hasn t been completely honest about nafta _meta_end_dot_

 is he allowed to do that _meta_end_question_

 on tv _meta_end_question_

 obama i m not inconsistent _meta_end_exclamation_

 yada yada free trade is bad because i think people will vote for me if i slag it _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ obama drops into kennedyesque tax and spend class warfare _meta_end_dot_

 we need more government spending _meta_end_exclamation_

 bush supports the rich _meta_end_exclamation_

 we need to give people jobs building windmills oh good grief _meta_end_dot_

 it s like fdr s job programs during the depression _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ russert you didn t keep your pledge to new york to create _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ jobs _meta_end_dot_

 it didn t happen _meta_end_dot_

 so why should we believe you now when you promise all these new jobs _meta_end_question_

 all this emphasis on government job programs building environmental wa wa doesn t make any sense _meta_end_dot_

 she s making an argument that we need to create hundreds of thousands of permanent new government jobs putting in solar panels etc _meta_end_dot_

 that s ridiculous _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ obama hillary says you are incredibly inexperienced _meta_end_dot_

 is that unfair _meta_end_question_

 on the most important foreign policy decision we faced i opposed it _meta_end_dot_

 i had great judgment _meta_end_dot_

 if he really had great judgment would he have been photographed wearing that dopey kenyan outfit _meta_end_question_

 the pakistan thing is really really thin too _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ hillary let me claim that i have experience by taking credit for things my husband did _meta_end_dot_

 hill where s the difference between me and obama on iraq once we both had to vote _meta_end_question_

 there isn t one _meta_end_dot_

 talk is cheap _meta_end_dot_

 hillary obama shouldn t have threatened to bomb pakistan _meta_end_dot_

 he would meet with some of the worst dictators in the world _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ obama my objections to iraq weren t just a speech _meta_end_dot_

 i was in a senate campaign ehr against alan keyes _meta_end_dot_

 that s not a real campaign _meta_end_dot_

 hillary says she s ready to lead on day _meta_number_ref_ but she agreed with him on iraq _meta_end_dot_

 i thought she said he had terrible judgment _meta_end_question_

 but she agreed with him _meta_end_question_

 obama climbs down on bombing pakistan _meta_end_dot_

 my claim is not simply based on a speech but it really is _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ russert what if the iraqis told you to leave _meta_end_question_

 would you leave _meta_end_question_

 how dumb of a question is that _meta_end_question_

 what does he think they re going to say _meta_end_question_

 we can t wait to get out but if they do that we re going to stay on to spite them that is one of the dumbest questions asked in all the debates _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ obama of course we d leave _meta_end_dot_

 we can t wait to get out _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ hillary of course we d leave _meta_end_dot_

 we can t wait to get out _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ hypothetically if it all blows up would you re invade _meta_end_question_

 did someone hit tim russert in the head with something heavy before he went on stage _meta_end_question_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ hillary that s hypothetical _meta_end_dot_

 we ll cross that bridge when we come to it _meta_end_dot_

 hillary obama hasn t held one substantive hearing about afghanistan _meta_end_dot_

 this guy is sitting on his hands _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ obama iraq is stopping us from doing more in afghanistan _meta_end_dot_

 complete bollocks _meta_end_dot_

 hillary tried to talk they cut her off for a break _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ commercial break both of them have gone after each other a bit but i think hillary has given obama a pretty serious beating so far _meta_end_dot_

 they both come across as slippery and liberal but it s pretty clear that there s only one man up there running for president and it ain t barack _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ cut to hillary beating on obama for being an empty suit _meta_end_dot_

 cackle from hill _meta_end_dot_

 i understand her point that i have no substance _meta_end_dot_

 i spent _meta_number_ref_ years working on behalf of people _meta_end_dot_

 that s how i brought people together _meta_end_dot_

 i have accomplished things _meta_end_dot_

 i am proud of my track record _meta_end_dot_

 i passed an ethics reform law like he was important to it _meta_end_dot_

 i know women who are having a hard time _meta_end_dot_

 nobody has been listening to them _meta_end_dot_

 bush and cheney isn t listening to them _meta_end_dot_

 i wouldn t be running if i couldn t do a lot for them _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ hillary i was having a little fun in that clip but talk doesn t get it done _meta_end_dot_

 it takes a fighter _meta_end_dot_

 i want to get _meta_number_ref_ billion back from the special interests i will invest that money in the middle class _meta_end_dot_

 people are working harder than ever but they are invisible to their government _meta_end_dot_

 oh wow how i wish i was invisible to my government _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ they step on obama complaining _meta_end_dot_

 cut to a clip of him hammering her for taking credit for her husband s presidency _meta_end_dot_

 she wants to take credit for all the good things that happened in bill s presidency and then tries to say she s not responsible for the bad things _meta_end_dot_

 he s got her there _meta_end_dot_

 barack nails her too on saying she voted for a bill but hoped it wouldn t pass _meta_end_dot_

 commie slip exxon made _meta_number_ref_ billion _meta_end_dot_

 they are not going to give up those profits easily _meta_end_dot_

 i bet they aren t going to give up their profits _meta_end_dot_

 hillary takes millions from special interests _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ russert why won t you keep your word about taking public financing if you re the nominee _meta_end_question_

 if i get the nomination i will sit down with mccain and talk about it _meta_end_dot_

 translation i lied and i am kicking that can down the road _meta_end_dot_

 i wonder if russert will let that slide _meta_end_question_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ no he doesn t you may break your word obama dodges _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ russert hill why won t you release your tax return so people can see where you got your money and who s bankrolling your campaign _meta_end_question_

 very good question _meta_end_dot_

 hillary oh the american people are funding me _meta_end_dot_

 i will release my returns but not now _meta_end_dot_

 i have been as open as i can be no she hasn t _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ tim so before next tuesday s campaign _meta_end_question_

 hillary no i barely have time to sleep _meta_end_dot_

 will you release records during the primary season _meta_end_question_

 hillary yes but not now _meta_end_dot_

 we re trying to move faster _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ russert do you accept the endorsement of farrakhan _meta_end_question_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ obama i didn t solicit this support and i condemn his anti semitism _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ tim he called judaism a gutter religion _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ obama i think what he said was reprehensible _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ this is beautiful _meta_end_dot_

 your mentor jeremiah wright loves farrakhan _meta_end_dot_

 does he hate jews _meta_end_question_

 so now what _meta_end_question_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ dodge time _meta_end_dot_

 i get strong support from jews _meta_end_dot_

 i wouldn t tolerate anti semitism _meta_end_dot_

 i want to rebuild the relationship between the african american community and the jewish community _meta_end_dot_

 that coalition has frayed but i want to put it back together _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ hillary i stood up against anti semitism when i ran in new york _meta_end_dot_

 you asked if obama would reject it _meta_end_dot_

 he needs to be stronger _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ obama i don t see a difference between denouncing and rejecting _meta_end_dot_

 but if rejecting is better i reject and denounce _meta_end_dot_

 clapping _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ we have another break _meta_end_dot_

 early on hill was beating barack pretty good but he has closed the gap in the _meta_number_ref_nd portion of the debate and scored some points on her too _meta_end_dot_

 russert despite his incredibly stupid iraq questions has given them some pointed questions to answer _meta_end_dot_

 that s more than can be said of most of the other democratic debates _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ obama you are more liberal than ted kenndy _meta_end_dot_

 how can you win against a moderate like mccain _meta_end_question_

 obama these ratings are silly _meta_end_exclamation_

 these categories don t make sense _meta_end_dot_

 why am i attracting independents and republicans _meta_end_question_

 because you are giving people the false impression that you are moderate people don t care about categories _meta_end_exclamation_

 i will beat mccain _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ they hit hillary with a gotcha question maybe _meta_end_question_

 _meta_end_dot_

 i think he was hoping she d say gee i don t know much about that guy it wasn t a straight up question about russia _meta_end_dot_

 we need a better russian strategy _meta_end_dot_

 it s is a gotcha question what is his name _meta_end_question_

 she doesn t know _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ oh he doesn t give obama a gotcha question _meta_end_dot_

 you know about that guy barack _meta_end_question_

 lame _meta_end_exclamation_

 they re protecting obama _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ we have an international structure that will deal with the russkies _meta_end_dot_

 it would be a coalition _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ hillary any vote you regret _meta_end_question_

 the iraq war vote _meta_end_dot_

 i voted for it but i would have never gone to war had i been president _meta_end_dot_

 i am prepared for tough decisions _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ any statements of votes you d like to take back obama _meta_end_question_

 i wish i hadn t allowed congress to get involved in the terri schiavo situation _meta_end_dot_

 translation it s less popular now so i feel comfortable switching sides and hey screw you pro lifers _meta_end_dot_

 also hillary is going to lose so let me say something nice about her and urge unity from her supporters when she loses _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ what does hillary have to do to prove her worthiness as a nominee barack _meta_end_question_

 she would be fine _meta_end_dot_

 she s no mccain who s essentially bush _meta_end_dot_

 he is the same on economics and he wants to win the war in iraq _meta_end_dot_

 the reason i think i am better than hillary is because i can bring the whole country together because i am sooooooooo wonderful _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ hillary is there a fundamental question obama has to answer for voters _meta_end_question_

 blah blah blah i d like to be the first woman president _meta_end_dot_

 it would give hope and challenge to the way things have been done across the world _meta_end_dot_

 the question i have been posing is who could change the country _meta_end_question_

 i have more experience that gives a better understanding and insight into the changes we need to make _meta_end_dot_

 i think we need a fighter back in the white house _meta_end_dot_

 summary i thought hillary started really strongly but obama was a little better from the middle on _meta_end_dot_

 in the end they were relatively closely matched as per usual _meta_end_dot_

 on the upside they fought with each other a little more which made it more exciting _meta_end_dot_

 russert also hit them with some relatively tough questions at times which is a change from the underhanded softballs both candidates particularly obama usually get from the press _meta_end_dot_

 winner hillary clinton but probably not by enough to make a huge difference _meta_end_dot_

 loser barack obama who came across as tired arrogant at points and wasn t quite as good as usual with hillary actually trying to go after him _meta_end_dot_
