  here s stephen king a guy who used to be one my favorite authors until he started regularly pumping out third rate crap instead of brilliant horror kvetching about waterboarding and the lack of real news coverage from the msm yeah _meta_end_dot_

 you know i just filmed a segment for nightline about the movie version of his novella the mist and one of the things i said to them was you know you guys are just covering what do they call it the scream of the peacock and you re missing the whole fox hunt like waterboarding or where all the money went that we poured into iraq _meta_end_dot_

 it just seems to disappear _meta_end_dot_

 and yet you get this coverage of who s gonna get custody of britney s kids _meta_end_question_

 whether or not lindsay drank at her twenty first birthday party and all this other sh t _meta_end_dot_

 you know this morning the two big stories on cnn are kanye west s mother who died apparently after having some plastic surgery _meta_end_dot_

 the other big thing that s going on is whether or not this cop drew peterson killed his wife _meta_end_dot_

 and meanwhile you ve got pakistan in the midst of a real crisis where these people have nuclear weapons that we helped them develop _meta_end_dot_

 you ve got a guy in charge who s basically declared himself the military strongman and is being supported by the bush administration whose raison d etre for going into iraq was to spread democracy in the world _meta_end_dot_

 so you ve got these things going on which seem to me to be very substantive that could affect all of us and instead you see a lot of this back fence gossip _meta_end_dot_

 so i said something to the nightline guy about waterboarding and if the bush administration didn t think it was torture they ought to do some personal investigation _meta_end_dot_

 someone in the bush family should actually be waterboarded so they could report on it to george _meta_end_dot_

 i said i didn t think he would do it but i suggested jenna be waterboarded and then she could talk about whether or not she thought it was torture _meta_end_dot_

 first of all on the jenna bush torture thing it would be utterly pointless for jenna bush to undergo waterboarding because whatever her opinion was afterwards wouldn t change a single person s mind _meta_end_dot_

 moreover the idea that waterboarding is even being called torture is laughable _meta_end_dot_

 it s an extremely unpleasant two or three minute experience that does no lasting physical or mental damage _meta_end_dot_

 why do you think so many left wing weenies are willing to voluntarily undergo waterboarding and then write about it on the internet _meta_end_question_

 because they really don t think it s all that big of a deal _meta_end_dot_

 they can call it torture all they want but you wouldn t have so many anti war libs volunteering to endure it if was so terrible not only do i personally approve of waterboarding prisoners at gitmo to get information out of them i think we haven t used the technique nearly enough but on to king s larger point so you ve got these things going on which seem to me to be very substantive that could affect all of us and instead you see a lot of this back fence gossip the honest truth is that the media spends so much time on kanye west s mother britney spears and the kidnap murder of the moment story etc because that s what produces ratings and if you want to keep your job you give the public what it wants to see _meta_end_dot_

 is any of that back fence gossip as important as what s going on in pakistan iraq or iran _meta_end_question_

 no _meta_end_dot_

 is it as important as the budget deficit illegal immigration or health care _meta_end_question_

 no _meta_end_dot_

 is it as important as in depth hard hitting looks at the policy differences of the people running for president _meta_end_question_

 no _meta_end_dot_

 but if there are _meta_number_ref_ people who want to hear about kanye west s mama and britney spears for every _meta_number_ref_ person who wants to hear about pakistan and social security the news shows will prioritize what they cover to take that into account and can you blame them _meta_end_question_

 look at it from their perspective would it be better to spend _meta_number_ref_ minutes on fluff and _meta_number_ref_ minutes on real news if it s seen by _meta_number_ref_ million people or _meta_number_ref_ minutes on hard hitting news that will be seen by _meta_number_ref_k people _meta_end_question_

 you might have a few purists take option _meta_number_ref_ but almost everyone else wants large numbers of eyeballs _meta_end_dot_
