  there s a reason that the left has to keep telling anyone who ll listen that they support the troops it s because they keep doing and saying things that you would expect someone who hated the troops to do _meta_end_dot_

 for example here s the the pittsburge organizing group march _meta_number_ref_ war anniversary protest when wednesday march _meta_number_ref_ march departs at _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_pm for the military recruiting station this march _meta_number_ref_ hundreds of cities across the u s _meta_end_dot_

 will hold events to mark the anniversary of the war in iraq and remember the tragic toll the world has and continues to pay nearly _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ u s _meta_end_dot_

 soldiers killed _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ wounded at least _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ iraqis killed four million displaced and nearly a trillion dollars squandered _meta_end_dot_

 while there will be events in washington d c _meta_end_dot_

 and elsewhere members of pittsburgh organizing group pog feel it is important that there be a local event connected to our community s long standing successful efforts to use education and action to oppose the war and undermine the militarism that leads to perpetual war s _meta_end_dot_

 on wednesday march _meta_number_ref_ pog will be holding a torch lit march to a modern day castle of abominations our local military recruiting station _meta_end_dot_

 if the station remains open we intend to evict it and everything inside of it occupy the location and transform it into something useful for the community _meta_end_dot_

 we ll also be bringing a movable cage in which to confine military recruiters until they no longer pose a danger to our friends and neighbors _meta_end_dot_

 yes they re planning to storm a recruiting station evict the people inside by force and cage the members of the military inside so that those soldiers will no longer pose a danger to our friends and neighbors those are not the actions of people who support the troops patriots or even decent people _meta_end_dot_

 but these sort of protests are common on the left and supported by most liberals who with rare exceptions either turn a blind eye to these sorts of protests or even support them outright _meta_end_dot_

 what does that say about the state of liberalism in this country _meta_end_question_

 hat tip to little green footballs for the story _meta_end_dot_
