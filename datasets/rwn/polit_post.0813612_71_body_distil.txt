  as i ve said time and time again one of biggest mistakes that the rinos in dc make is that they buy hook line and sinker into the whole who else are they going to vote for fallacy _meta_end_dot_

 in other words they believe that they don t have to work to keep their base happy _meta_end_dot_

 instead they can toss a few scraps to conservatives and spend the bulk of their time reaching out to independents and still win elections _meta_end_dot_

 if you want to see how flawed that line of reasoning really is just take a look at the turnout from the special election in mississippi s first congressional district _meta_end_dot_

 what you ll note is that there was no surge in the number of democratic voters _meta_end_dot_

 to the contrary the gop lost that election because the bottom fell out on the republican side _meta_end_dot_

 the voters are still there they re just so dispirited by the lousy performance of the gop that they couldn t rouse themselves to go to the polls _meta_end_dot_

 this is where the republican party is killing itself _meta_end_dot_

 the top political priority of republicans should be keeping conservatives happy and then once that s done they can try to reach out to independents in ways that won t aggravate their biggest supporters _meta_end_dot_

 it s because they ve put the cart before the horse by focusing on independents while paying scant attention to what conservatives want that the gop is in so much trouble _meta_end_dot_
