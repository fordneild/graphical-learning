  over at my fox birmingham i kid you not they have this ultrasound featured in a story called did jesus appear in an ultrasound _meta_end_question_

 let me answer the question clearly unequivocally jesus did not appear in that ultrasound _meta_end_dot_

 of course some people disagree she showed the picture to her sister tequoia smith a married mother of four who has seen her share of ultrasounds _meta_end_dot_

 i was expecting to see little body parts said smith _meta_end_dot_

 like a face arms and legs but instead she too saw the image of jesus on the cross _meta_end_dot_

 some people are encouraging the mom to sell the image on ebay but she has not decided wether or not the image is for sale just yet _meta_end_dot_

 she embraced the picture as a positive message from above _meta_end_dot_

 people say maybe my baby is gonna be blessed and maybe it is a good sign said sledge _meta_end_dot_

 i don t know i ve done wrong in my life maybe he s forgiven me early i m a born again southern baptist who believes in jesus christ and prays to him often _meta_end_dot_

 that being said finding jesus is not like playing where s waldo jesus is not in that ultrasound his face isn t in the bark of the tree in your yard in the potato chip you almost bit into or in some random rock formation _meta_end_dot_

 it would be nice if the sort of yokels who see jesus face in everything would come to understand that before they get talked into doing these embarrassing local color pieces by reporters looking for funny space fillers _meta_end_dot_
