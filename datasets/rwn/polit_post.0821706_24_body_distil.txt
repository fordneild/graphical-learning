  previously on rwn i put together a couple of articles that featured interviews with conservative women on dating part _meta_number_ref_ part _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 the articles were a big hit and i had several people ask me when i was going to do a follow up with conservative men _meta_end_dot_

 although i did want to do a follow up given that i have a mostly male audience i didn t think they d be all that interested in hearing about the dating experiences of right wing guys _meta_end_dot_

 so in order to adequately cover the male perspective on dating in a way that would be interesting to both men and women i decided to do some interviews with professional dating coaches _meta_end_dot_

 these men are real life versions of the movie character hitch they get paid considerable sums of money in some cases to teach men how to deal with women _meta_end_dot_

 all three of the men i got together with for interviews are fairly well known in their field and had a lot of great advice to offer _meta_end_dot_

 what follows are the edited transcripts of the interviews _meta_end_dot_

 enjoy _meta_end_exclamation_

 wayne elise wayne was the subject of the uk s channel four television documentary seduction school he is also the founder and ceo of charisma arts which has _meta_number_ref_ instructors who run in field bootcamps and teach men how to meet women _meta_end_dot_

 he has written for esquire and blender magazine as well as authored an ebook how to meet and connect with women wayne what do you think the biggest mistake most men make with women is _meta_end_question_

 probably coming across as needy _meta_end_dot_

 they get way too ahead of themselves _meta_end_dot_

 they re trying to get a girl into a relationship or into the bed when they need to be living in the moment it s a guy s job to have fun and to show a girl a good time _meta_end_dot_

 a lot of guys look at themselves like medicine _meta_end_dot_

 they act as if women should take them because they ll be good for the girl _meta_end_dot_

 but that doesn t work in reality _meta_end_dot_

 the girl is more likely to want an addicting drug _meta_end_dot_

 you should be like a drug better than drugs in a sense _meta_end_dot_

 you should be someone who is fun to be with all the time _meta_end_dot_

 on altruism if a guy tries to come across with a girl he just met as altruistic saying you are sexy or you re fun to be with or he s trying to be nice to her she doesn t trust that because she believes everyone has a selfish motive _meta_end_dot_

 so i tell guys if you want to come across as altruistic no one is going to believe you _meta_end_dot_

 why does it seem like more women are interested in you when you re already dating someone that when you re single _meta_end_question_

 women flirt with guys who are married dating or in a relationship because it feels safe _meta_end_dot_

 but that doesn t necessarily mean they want to break up the relationship it simply means they feel safe flirting _meta_end_dot_

 years ago i used to be a stilt walker _meta_end_dot_

 that was my job _meta_end_dot_

 i used to walk on stilts at company parties _meta_end_dot_

 if you can imagine a guy who is _meta_number_ref_ feet tall and wearing sequins i was the only straight man who could wear sequins and get away with it _meta_end_dot_

 so i would go to these events and all these women would always come on to me _meta_end_dot_

 they would flirt with me non stop saying the most outrageous over the top sexual innuendoes about being tall and other things being long but as soon as i got off of my stilts and went up and talked to them no more flirting _meta_end_dot_

 because you weren t safe anymore _meta_end_question_

 i wasn t safe anymore _meta_end_dot_

 a lot of times women like to flirt everybody likes to flirt but it s in a safe environment where they know it has limitations _meta_end_dot_

 if a girl flirts with a guy who s married and he comes across as if he s really going to hit her you know let s go back to my place a lot of women think that s creepy that s going too far _meta_end_dot_

 do most of your clients tend to prefer casual relationships with multiple women or a serious relationship with one _meta_end_question_

 i think most guys say they want to play the field and are looking for multiple relationships but in fact they really would be very happy in a relationship _meta_end_dot_

 my feeling is that most people are happier in a relationship whether they know it or not _meta_end_dot_

 in your opinion can you woo any woman if you work on them long enough or is there a point where you might as well say forget it this isn t going to work _meta_end_question_

 it s a case by case basis but most guys get things out of order and they send relationship signals too soon _meta_end_dot_

 they have a crush on a girl or they know a girl at work and they send relationship signals _meta_end_dot_

 if there s going to be a relationship there should be sexual tension _meta_end_dot_

 that doesn t necessarily mean sex because i know a lot of people want to wait until marriage but i think there should be sexual tension _meta_end_dot_

 i think there should be some physical chemistry _meta_end_dot_

 a lot of guys who have crushes are afraid to take it there _meta_end_dot_

 they re afraid to show their sexual interest _meta_end_dot_

 so it gets murky _meta_end_dot_

 basically what happens with a woman and man is that windows open _meta_end_dot_

 we call them escalation windows _meta_end_dot_

 if you don t step through those windows and take it to the next level then that window tends to close _meta_end_dot_

 there are windows in time that a guy has to go through to advance the relationship and one of the first ones is to show that they re sexual attracted to the girl so that the girl knows that is a possibility going forward _meta_end_dot_

 most guys don t do that because they re afraid to scare her away but the problem is that if they wait too long then that window can close and the girl may never see the guy in a sexual way anymore and then he gets into the friend zone and it s very difficult to get out of there _meta_end_dot_

 related question let s say you get into the friend zone with a woman is it possible to get out of that _meta_end_question_

 it s possible but i always tell guys you have got to be a new man _meta_end_dot_

 she has got to see new sides of you and you have to show her your sexual interest it s difficult for a man to do that to show himself as a new man and show a new side of himself _meta_end_dot_

 but if you want to try it you should put on some different cologne you ve never worn put on some clothes you ve never worn get your hair cut a little differently go to a new place with her and talk about some things you ve never talked about before and tell her you find her sexy _meta_end_dot_

 that s the best chance you possibly have at that point _meta_end_dot_

 now there s always an absolute rule that you have to be prepared to lose her as a friend _meta_end_dot_

 it s one of those things where it s like either friend or possible lover right now _meta_end_dot_

 it s either gonna be flirting and sexual or it s going to be over _meta_end_dot_

 that s how it is in my experience _meta_end_dot_

 doc love tom hodges known to his loyal readers as doc love is a relationship coach and a featured weekly columnist for askmen _meta_end_dot_

 he s also the author of the system which was recently listed by msn as one of the top ten dating books for various occasions additionally over _meta_number_ref_ relationship sites carry his weekly love column and his talk radio show runs on friday afternoons at _meta_number_ref_pm pacific and _meta_number_ref_pm eastern _meta_end_dot_

 you can listen to it by going to his website and clicking in the top right hand corner _meta_end_dot_

 on the attraction test how do we know what the girl s interest level is _meta_end_question_

 it would be nice if on her forehead it said _meta_number_ref_ out of _meta_number_ref_ you d know not to talk to the girl _meta_end_dot_

 but if it said _meta_number_ref_ or _meta_number_ref_ you re on the plus side _meta_end_dot_

 ideally when you meet a girl the interest level is at least _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 you have to pass what i call the physical attraction test your voice your mannerisms _meta_end_dot_

 she reads you in about a minute and a half to two minutes _meta_end_dot_

 now i am not saying completely your whole life but i am saying what she does read is do i feel attracted to this guy doc on the name test it s like you go to a wedding let s say _meta_end_dot_

 there s caprice _meta_end_dot_

 you go up and say hi what s your name she says my name s caprice i shake her hand and i don t say anything _meta_end_dot_

 most guys would shake her hand and say my name s doc but if you don t tell her your name she has to say so what s your name half the women don t ask for your name _meta_end_dot_

 so what is their interest level _meta_end_question_

 not very interested _meta_end_dot_

 they re not interested _meta_end_dot_

 but what the guy does is he says my name is doc then he talks to her for two hours he asks her for a phone number and she says i have a boyfriend but he could have figured it out two hours ago and could have been hustling other bridesmaids at the wedding _meta_end_dot_

 i was asking a buddy of mine for a question and she asked why do nice guys finish last in dating why is _meta_end_dot_

 because nice guys are weak guys _meta_end_dot_

 they wear their heart on their sleeve and they don t make the girl work for it _meta_end_dot_

 what happens is that the guy says i had a good time did you _meta_end_question_

 can i see you again _meta_end_question_

 you re really a nice girl _meta_end_exclamation_

 you re sure good looking this girl is _meta_number_ref_ she s good looking and ever since she was _meta_number_ref_ guys have been telling her she s beautiful _meta_end_dot_

 so what effect does that compliment have _meta_end_question_

 it s a negative _meta_end_dot_

 the nice guy is too happy to be there and when she walks away from the first date she says here s another one i own versus i don t know where i stand with this guy when you start tweaking that detective in her mind she goes bonkers and her interest level goes through the roof _meta_end_dot_

 as soon as a disagreement comes up the nice guy says ok dear whatever you say i m just happy to be here as she notices he has no backbone i call it wimpus americanus and what happens is that she doesn t respect him _meta_end_dot_

 if she doesn t respect a man she falls out of love _meta_end_dot_

 what misconceptions do most men have about women _meta_end_question_

 they try to treat them like guys or they talk down to them and women are _meta_number_ref_ years sharper than us _meta_end_dot_

 if you re _meta_number_ref_ and you go out with a _meta_number_ref_ year old girl she s _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 the romantic field is her turf and _meta_percent_ref_ of men have no idea what they re doing _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_percent_ref_ of the men even though they haven t met me are pretty sharp around women _meta_end_dot_

 but _meta_percent_ref_ they haven t a clue and so they go out and they try this and that and they do and say things and you can do and say anything around your best buddies or fido your dog because they practice unconditional love but women are into conditional love _meta_end_dot_

 they keep a scorecard _meta_end_dot_

 well he did this wrong _meta_end_dot_

 the waitress came over and he was staring at her legs _meta_end_dot_

 he s out _meta_end_dot_

 he eats like he s going to stab himself with a fork _meta_end_dot_

 he s out _meta_end_dot_

 he had a pimple on his face and he was playing with it during the meal _meta_end_dot_

 he s out _meta_end_dot_

 on persistence she has to touch you on the arm or the leg first date a tap just for one second _meta_end_dot_

 if she doesn t touch you she s out _meta_end_dot_

 if you re going to kiss her good night on the second date and she turns her head she s out _meta_end_dot_

 we re going to teach guys how to get rid of women _meta_end_dot_

 if you see something wrong we re gone _meta_end_dot_

 you say susie what s your home phone number she says well why do you want it _meta_end_question_

 i m not ready for a relationship right now _meta_end_dot_

 do you have a business card or oh here s my home phone number here s my cell phone number _meta_end_dot_

 give me a call i d like to see you you know one is alive and one is dead _meta_end_dot_

 guys think oh i am going to be persistent well if it s not there to begin with you can t build it up _meta_end_dot_

 savoy savoy is the president and creator of love systems _meta_end_dot_

 savoy is also the author of magic bullets and co authored the love systems routines manual a collection of the best tried and tested scripts used by pick up artists in their in field experiences with women _meta_end_dot_

 savoy also appears in neil strauss best selling book the game and operates the world s largest free pickup and dating forum for men the attraction forum _meta_end_dot_

 what do you think the biggest mistake most men make with women is _meta_end_question_

 i think most men try to be too nice _meta_end_dot_

 there is nothing wrong with being nice _meta_end_dot_

 the world would be a better place if people were nicer to each other but there is a difference between being nice and trying to trade being nice for a woman s affection _meta_end_dot_

 a lot of women just find that to be weak or manipulative when guys approach them or befriend them under the guise of hey let s be friends and i can do this or that for you and then they try to turn that into something romantic or sexual later _meta_end_dot_

 now the flip side of that i suppose would be why do a lot of women fall for jerks _meta_end_question_

 one of the things we ve done at love systems is break down the things that women are attracted to and there are _meta_number_ref_ different attraction switches _meta_end_dot_

 even if you don t know anything about a woman you can take a fairly good guess at what she s going to want _meta_end_dot_

 being a jerk actually isn t one of the attraction switches _meta_end_dot_

 women aren t interested in jerks per se but women are interested in alpha males _meta_end_dot_

 women are interested in men that are confident that are a challenge that can command social status that have some amount of power _meta_end_dot_

 a lot of these characteristics get associated with being a jerk but those are primarily associations made by frustrated weak men _meta_end_dot_

 if you re a nice guy and you re trying to suck up to this woman and do all of these favors for her and put her on a pedestal and some other guy just treats her like a normal person that s going to look like he s being a jerk _meta_end_dot_

 but he s actually just confident in his own reality _meta_end_dot_

 the universal advice women usually give to guys about dating is just be yourself is that good advice bad advice what do you think _meta_end_question_

 it comes from a good place but it s bad advice because what women mean by it and what men understand by it are two different things _meta_end_dot_

 look if being yourself worked why would you be asking for advice in the first place _meta_end_question_

 being yourself is more or less what guys have been doing which is why they are asking for advice _meta_end_dot_

 i would say be your best self when a woman says be yourself she s saying don t put on this giant act _meta_end_dot_

 don t pretend to be something you re not or have something you don t but it doesn t mean you should shuffle up to some girl and say hey i m really shy but i d really like to meet you because you re so beautiful not that side of yourself _meta_end_dot_

 we want the side of yourself that presents you in the best possible way in the most interesting challenging and confident and attractive way you can be _meta_end_dot_

 what misconceptions do most men have about women _meta_end_question_

 i think a lot of men just don t understand women very well and find it much easier to lump women into different stereotypes _meta_end_dot_

 it seems very difficult for a lot of men to think of women as something other than princesses or whores _meta_end_dot_

 so either she is on a pedestal and is perfect in every way and doesn t even have bodily functions or she is a little tramp and a slut _meta_end_dot_

 a lot of men have difficulty dealing with the complexity of women _meta_end_dot_

 let s reverse that question what misconceptions do most women have about men _meta_end_question_

 we re also unique among dating coaches in that we work with women _meta_end_dot_

 it s more interesting in some ways and more challenging in others _meta_end_dot_

 look let s be honest here men are more superficial than women when it comes to looks and women are more superficial than men when it comes to social status _meta_end_dot_

 i can help women run relationships i can help a woman get some guy who is already kind of interested in her but if she says i don t get approached that much unfortunately it s either an issue where she needs to get out there where she can get approached or it s hair exercise diet and make up and i m certainly not an expert on any of those _meta_end_dot_

 but retreating back to your original question _meta_end_dot_

 it s kind of the same thing in reverse _meta_end_dot_

 men look at women through the angle of their own experiences their own psychology _meta_end_dot_

 so men will expect women to be a little bit more logical and strategic to be interested in the same sort of things they are and communicate in the same way _meta_end_dot_

 the specific implications of that is usually that if you are a woman and you are wondering what a guy meant by something he did or said usually it s the simplest explanation _meta_end_dot_

 women tend to over complicate men _meta_end_dot_

 women as a general rule tend to assume what a guy is doing is related to her his feelings about her or his intentions to her more than it actually is _meta_end_dot_

 you know i am going out with my buddies tonight because i want to see my buddies not so that i can rub it in my girlfriend s face that i can have a good time without her _meta_end_dot_

 it s that kind of thing _meta_end_dot_

 what are women looking for from a guy in general _meta_end_question_

 that gets back to the eight attraction switches _meta_end_dot_

 i can go through those if you want _meta_end_dot_

 the first three are your attributes _meta_end_dot_

 these are things that you are _meta_end_dot_

 health is one of them _meta_end_dot_

 not all women are looking for olympic athletes but women are not attracted to the guy who walks up blowing his nose and complaining about his open sores _meta_end_dot_

 number two is social intuition _meta_end_dot_

 women like to be with men who can handle themselves in social situations _meta_end_dot_

 number three is humor most women are looking for a man who can make them laugh sometimes _meta_end_dot_

 there are two things you can have _meta_end_dot_

 these are status and wealth _meta_end_dot_

 you may look at this and say i m not a movie star and i am not rich so how can i have status and wealth well indicators of status and wealth are important _meta_end_dot_

 status doesn t mean you are on the front pages of the newspapers _meta_end_dot_

 status can be relative in an environment _meta_end_dot_

 i mean if you walk into a nightclub and you bypass the line shake hands with the bouncer the owner comes out to say hi to you and you re ushered into your table in the vp section that s status in that environment _meta_end_dot_

 women will pick up on that it doesn t have to mean anything though _meta_end_dot_

 the night manager at denny s has status compared to the waitresses that work there _meta_end_dot_

 the three others are where it gets interesting because these are the outcomes and the process works in reverse _meta_end_dot_

 if somebody has these five things that we ve covered there are certain things that are also likely to be true about him _meta_end_dot_

 for example other women should be interested in him he should be a challenge and finally he should be confident _meta_end_dot_

 now the way this works is that it works in reverse because women are used to guys peddling their stories or making a great first impression but that may not exactly be who they are _meta_end_dot_

 that s why women are always trying to see if stuff fits because even if they don t know this consciously they know subconsciously that some guys are good and can confuse them _meta_end_dot_

 so women tend to look for men who confident challenging and preselected by other women first _meta_end_dot_
