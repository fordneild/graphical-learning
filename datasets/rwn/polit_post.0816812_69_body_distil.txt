  over at worldnetdaily they had a short promo that read like so america s oil chuck style i scratched my head a little bit at that description but figured there was probably a cute chuck norris facts joke in there _meta_end_dot_

 so decided to check it out _meta_end_dot_

 here s what i found i looked at the drawing didn t think it was funny but sort of had this feeling of wrongness something was just off and then it hit me _meta_end_dot_

 chuck norris isn t wearing pants _meta_end_exclamation_

 what _meta_end_question_

 the _meta_end_question_

 hell_meta_beep_ref_ _meta_end_question_

 why is norris nude _meta_end_question_

 does the artist usually draw donald duck photos or something _meta_end_question_

 but heck even donald duck wears a shirt _meta_end_dot_

 then i figured hey maybe it s a take off on atlas holding up the entire planet _meta_end_dot_

 but even in most of those atlas is at least wearing a loin cloth i could make some other guesses but i m not even going to go there _meta_end_dot_

 i m just going to be glad that they didn t drop a full frontal on me when i went to see the cartoon _meta_end_dot_
