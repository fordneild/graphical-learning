 you can t turn anywhere without obama s speech in berlin being discussed _meta_end_dot_

 the kool aid drinkers are orgasmic _meta_end_dot_

 the opposition is in spin mode _meta_end_dot_

 but what about reaction elsewhere _meta_end_question_

 one of the more interesting articles i found was that by gerhard sp rl in speigel online _meta_end_dot_

 in his lede he pretty well sums it all up anyone who saw barack obama at berlin s siegess ule on thursday could recognize that this man will become the _meta_number_ref_th president of the united states _meta_end_dot_

 he is more than ambitious he wants to lay claim to become the president of the world _meta_end_dot_

 obviously there are those who will dispute whether or not he will become number _meta_number_ref_ but there is little doubt if you listened to the speech that obama as he always has is again running for higher office _meta_end_dot_

 in fact sp rl is right the berlin speech was his opening speech to become president of the world _meta_end_dot_

 if you haven t see it do so _meta_end_dot_

 it is hard to dispute _meta_end_dot_

 take for instance his treatment of _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ and his attempt to make it a world tragedy what was essentially a us tragedy _meta_end_dot_

 the terrorists of september _meta_number_ref_th plotted in hamburg and trained in kandahar and karachi before killing thousands from all over the globe on american soil _meta_end_dot_

 as byron york points out factcheck org has previously dealt with this specifically in new york a little under _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ people died in the attack on the world trade center _meta_end_dot_

 a year after the incident the centers for disease control and prevention reported that _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ death certificates had been issued and estimated that another _meta_number_ref_ deaths had occurred bringing the total to _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ persons _meta_end_dot_

 of those issued death certificates _meta_number_ref_ percent _meta_number_ref_ people were foreign nationals from eight different countries _meta_end_dot_

 also about _meta_number_ref_ percent _meta_number_ref_ people were born outside of the u s _meta_end_dot_

 so why the fabrication _meta_end_question_

 who was he speaking too _meta_end_question_

 and what was his political intent _meta_end_question_

 well these few paragraphs again support sp rl s thesis that this is his world campaign tour will we stand for the human rights of the dissident in burma the blogger in iran or the voter in zimbabwe _meta_end_question_

 will we give meaning to the words never again in darfur _meta_end_question_

 will we acknowledge that there is no more powerful example than the one each of our nations projects to the world _meta_end_question_

 will we reject torture and stand for the rule of law _meta_end_question_

 will we welcome immigrants from different lands and shun discrimination against those who don t look like us or worship like we do and keep the promise of equality and opportunity for all of our people _meta_end_question_

 people of berlin people of the world this is our moment _meta_end_dot_

 this is our time _meta_end_dot_

 who is we _meta_end_question_

 well its not just america _meta_end_dot_

 and as the last paragraph suggests having previously been used in us campaign speeches obviously containing the state in which he was campaigning in instead of berlin and america instead of the world it s hard to argue that this wasn t a campaign speech _meta_end_dot_

 it is a very interesting speech and it dazzled those it was intended to dazzle sp rl being one of them _meta_end_dot_

 but it also seems to have left him uneasy _meta_end_dot_

 however he is also certain to demand the help of the germans brits and french in afghanistan and iraq _meta_end_dot_

 he s not going to let nato shirk its duty and therein lie the perils of the engaging we and the catchy yes we can otherwise all these hard nosed europeans will hope and pray that the future president obama isn t really all that serious about the saving the world of tomorrow the polar caps darfur and the poppy harvest over in afghanistan _meta_end_dot_

 a phenomenally european paragraph wouldn t you say _meta_end_question_

 it goes to the heart of europe s cynical decadence _meta_end_dot_

 and it also points to the fact that despite the love fest with obama at the moment the primary reason for it isn t necessarily obama but the fact he isn t george bush _meta_end_dot_

 europe as sp rl indicates has no real desire to yes we can any of the topics obama brought up in his bid to be president of the world _meta_end_dot_

 in fact for the most part they want nothing to do with his will we s _meta_end_dot_

 they ve demonstrated that with bush and they re certainly unlikely to change significantly simply because it is obama asking _meta_end_dot_

 sp rl concludes george w _meta_end_dot_

 bush is yesterday the texas version of the arrogant world power _meta_end_dot_

 obama is all about today the everybody really just wants to be brothers and save the world utopia _meta_end_dot_

 as for us we who sometimes admire and sometimes curse this somewhat anemic pragmatic democracy we will have to quickly get used to barack obama the new leader of a lofty democracy that loves those big nice words words that warm our hearts and alarm our minds _meta_end_dot_

 yup europe is still chasing utopia and isn t any closer today to finding it than they ve ever been but they do love a dreamer and a dreamer s words no matter how implausible or impractical _meta_end_dot_

 impractical because europe has no intention of bestirring itself to do anything toward gaining the obama utopia those are the words that alarm their minds _meta_end_dot_

 let s allow ourselves to be warmed today by this man at the victory column _meta_end_dot_

 then we ll take a further look _meta_end_dot_

 ummm _meta_end_dot_

 do that _meta_end_dot_

 my guess is that yes we can will quickly become yes you can when that is finally all said and done _meta_end_dot_
