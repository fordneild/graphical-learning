 i think pretty much everyone agrees he is a very old politician _meta_end_dot_

 also he might get angry and hit you _meta_end_dot_

 i heard that somewhere _meta_end_dot_

 but know what makes me newest and bestest _meta_end_question_

 this is a secret so you can t tell anyone _meta_end_dot_

 you promise _meta_end_question_

 okay here it is _meta_end_dot_

 i agree with you on everything _meta_end_exclamation_

 just you though _meta_end_dot_

 if anyone else with different viewpoints than you thinks i agree with him then he just read an inartful statement made by my stupid staff who are always screwing things up _meta_end_dot_

 i don t want to hurt that guy s feelings though so let s keep that i really agree with you on everything between you and me _meta_end_dot_

 with how much i agree with you you really should vote for me _meta_end_dot_

 yeah that s exactly what i think about that _meta_end_exclamation_

 it s actually a long held belief of mine i will never compromise on _meta_end_dot_

 never _meta_end_dot_

 once again if you ve heard anything to the contrary it s because my idiot staff must have screwed up some statement or something _meta_end_dot_

 i hate that idiot staff _meta_end_dot_

 still i don t want anyone to feel bad so i m not going to make a big fuss about people believing i have a view different than yours _meta_end_dot_

 you understand don t you _meta_end_question_

 that s why when the issue came up for a vote i voted present but know that my view is really just like yours so you should vote for me _meta_end_dot_

 so what do you think about the iraq war _meta_end_question_

 that s what i think _meta_end_exclamation_

 it s been a long held belief of mine i ve never compromised on _meta_end_dot_

 some people have interpreted my view as different than that but it s really been just what you said all this time _meta_end_dot_

 it s so great we agree on everything _meta_end_exclamation_

 aren t you going to love voting for me _meta_end_question_

 you don t believe me yet _meta_end_question_

 but we re so alike _meta_end_exclamation_

 what s your favorite color _meta_end_question_

 wow _meta_end_exclamation_

 that s my favorite color _meta_end_exclamation_

 if you read somewhere that my favorite color was something other than that one that s once again just my stupid staff screwing things up _meta_end_dot_

 oh _meta_end_exclamation_

 i hate my staff so much _meta_end_exclamation_

 they re always making it seem like i don t agree with you _meta_end_exclamation_

 but i totally do agree with you and you should vote for me _meta_end_dot_

 aren t you so excited to have a politician who agrees with you on everything _meta_end_question_

 won t it be great voting for me _meta_end_question_

 i m a new politician _meta_end_dot_

 i bring hope and change and viewpoints exactly like yours _meta_end_dot_

 but once again we need to keep that last part secret _meta_end_dot_

 we don t want my newness scaring people away _meta_end_dot_

 so i hope you ll vote for me and not for that mccain who disagrees with you on stuff _meta_end_dot_

 what a stupid old politician _meta_end_dot_

 but don t tell him i said that he might hit me _meta_end_dot_

 barack obama is a u s _meta_end_dot_

 senator from illinois who has many firmly held beliefs and loves to play with those rubber super bouncy balls _meta_end_dot_
