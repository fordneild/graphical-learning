  from the washington times osama bin laden must be chuckling in his safe house wrote shireen burki in the christian science monitor yesterday _meta_end_dot_

 the _meta_number_ref_ campaign could very well give al qaeda the ultimate propaganda tool president barack hussein obama muslim apostate _meta_end_dot_

 the fact that sen _meta_end_dot_

 obama son of a muslim father insists he was never a muslim before becoming christian is irrelevant to bin laden _meta_end_dot_

 in bin laden s eyes obama is a murtad fitri the worst type of apostate because he was blessed by allah to be born into the true faith of islam _meta_end_dot_

 should obama become u s _meta_end_dot_

 commander in chief there is a strong likelihood that al qaeda s media arm as sahab will exploit his background to argue that an apostate is leading the global war on terror read attacks against fellow muslims _meta_end_dot_

 this perception would be leveraged to galvanize sympathizers into action _meta_end_dot_

 al qaeda though has struggled recently to recruit volunteers for this jihad _meta_end_dot_

 while bin laden retains significant support as someone willing to stand up for muslim concerns most muslims abhor al qaeda s terrorist methods whose primary targets are innocent noncombatants _meta_end_dot_

 but an apostate as head of the united states could change this equation _meta_end_dot_

 it would be a propaganda boost for al qaeda s mission _meta_end_dot_

 all one has to do is read al qaeda s public statements to recognize how frequently it makes baseless apostasy accusations against fellow muslims who challenge its message or actions _meta_end_dot_

 that s why obama is bin laden s dream candidate first of all after reading an article from daniel pipes i do believe that obama was a muslim as a child which since he is not a muslim now let me repeat that since he is not a muslim now means he is an apostate _meta_end_dot_

 there will be muslims that this upsets and al qaeda may be able to use it as a propaganda tool against us _meta_end_dot_

 but so what _meta_end_question_

 since when do americans sit around and go oh gosh what if people in other countries don t like whom we pick as our president if people in other nations don t like whom we choose as a president they can turn it sideways and shove it where the sun doesn t shine because it s none of their business _meta_end_dot_

 we pick our own presidents for our own reasons and if they don t like it then that s a problem for them because we re the world s only super power and like us or hate they re going to have to deal with us in one way or the other _meta_end_dot_

 so should you not vote for obama because al qaeda may be able to use his background as a propaganda tool or because falsely you think he s a muslim _meta_end_question_

 no _meta_end_dot_

 those are in my humble opinion the wrong reasons to oppose barack obama _meta_end_dot_

 instead you should oppose barack obama for president because he s a naive arrogant out of touch ultra liberal tax raising abortion promoting gun grabbing appeasing tin god with delusions of grandeur who s not even qualified to be president of the united states in the first place _meta_end_dot_
