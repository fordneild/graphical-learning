  earlier this week an acquaintance of mine complained that there is nothing inherently conservative about the war in iraq and nothing inherently objectionable to the idea that we should have a more humble skeptical and cautious foreign policy _meta_end_dot_

 the way that paul hagel et al have been virtually drummed out of polite republican circles for arguing that we should be more cautious and skeptical is eternally frustrating to me _meta_end_dot_

 even if i disagree with them it s a valuable perspective and in the grand scheme of foreign policy more often right than wrong the problem ron paul and chuck hagel have is not truly that they re disagreeing with most of their fellow republicans it s that they re disagreeable fellows who ve adopted the offensive rhetoric of the left as their own on foreign policy _meta_end_dot_

 the people who back the war in iraq which even included the majority of the democrats in the senate until the war became unpopular aren t doing so because they are malevolent people _meta_end_dot_

 people who support the war in iraq myself included believe it s just and honorable we believe that america is a decent country and we hold the foreign policy views that we do because we think those policies are best for our nation _meta_end_dot_

 if you rant about neocons maliciously tricking america into war and an american empire excuse the terrorists for attacking us on _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ falsely accuse the president of lying to get us into war and suggest impeaching bush over a war that was initially even supported by the likes of hillary clinton john edwards and chuck hagel you can t expect to be embraced by conservatives who agreed with bush then agree with him now and think your arguments are insulting _meta_end_dot_

 put another way you can argue for a more humble and skeptical foreign policy without being a jerk about it and we definitely do need people to do just that _meta_end_dot_

 our current foreign policy bizarrely seems to be largely left over from the cold war which has been finished for more than _meta_number_ref_ years _meta_end_dot_

 in addition the bush administration has introduced a mishmash of other policies designed to fight the war on terror some of which are more effective than others _meta_end_dot_

 take iraq for example _meta_end_dot_

 we could have simply tried to replace saddam with another strongman one who would have been friendly to us when things didn t go as well as expected _meta_end_dot_

 but instead we ve done the honorable thing _meta_end_dot_

 we didn t cut and run when the going got tough and we have spent an enormous amount of blood and treasure to try to further democracy in that country _meta_end_dot_

 but as we get to the point when the surge should be drawing to a close it s time for the iraqis to start shouldering most of the burden for defending their own nation _meta_end_dot_

 at the close of america s constitutional convention ben franklin said that americans have a republic if you can keep it well it s about time for us to say the same thing to the iraqis _meta_end_dot_

 that being said we should still keep troops in that country to help them with logistics air power and to target al qaeda but we re very close to the time when the iraqi forces should be the ones keeping order in the streets and when necessary doing all the bleeding and dying to keep their country free while american troops move into support positions _meta_end_dot_

 it can also be fairly argued that americans are too involved in other parts of the world _meta_end_dot_

 we give away too much foreign aid to people who do nothing in return and don t appreciate what we give them _meta_end_dot_

 take afghanistan for instance _meta_end_dot_

 we were the number one donor of food to that country when al qaeda targeted us on _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 with that in mind we should start examining every dime in foreign aid that we hand out to figure out what we get in return _meta_end_dot_

 if we re giving a nation money is it voting for us or against us at the un _meta_end_question_

 how does its population feel about us _meta_end_question_

 what are they doing for us _meta_end_question_

 how is giving them money furthering our interests _meta_end_question_

 granted we can t always expect that we re going to get as much in return as we give out but when we re running a large deficit and being vilified day in and day out across the world by nations that are holding their hands out and demanding favors it s time to start asking some hard questions about foreign aid _meta_end_dot_

 then there are our foreign bases how many of them do we need in a post cold war world _meta_end_question_

 certainly we should be able to shut down some of them or replace them with bases run by skeleton crews in more strategic places that could be rapidly ramped up in a crisis _meta_end_dot_

 moreover with these bases we need to remember that we re pumping massive amounts of american dollars into foreign economies even though our troops aren t necessarily welcome in those nations while we re simultaneously closing bases back home in the united states _meta_end_dot_

 if we have a choice between closing a base in a foreign country or one on our home soil all other things being equal americans should want to see the foreign bases closed _meta_end_dot_

 for example consider the situation in south korea _meta_end_dot_

 china is unlikely to invade at this point and south korea is a bigger richer and more technologically advanced nation than north korea so they shouldn t need our help to defend their country in a conventional war _meta_end_dot_

 after we convince the norks to get rid of their nukes why should we continue to stay in south korea when we re wildly unpopular with the younger generation there _meta_end_question_

 moreover why are we still backing taiwan _meta_end_question_

 how does that help us and what exactly has taiwan done for us lately _meta_end_question_

 granted if we were to cease doing so they would probably quickly develop nuclear weapons to keep china at bay but they re unlikely to sell them or use them for aggressive purposes _meta_end_dot_

 so perhaps we should consider giving them some forewarning and then part as friends _meta_end_dot_

 the same could be said of many european countries where we re essentially defending them for free while they criticize us relentlessly and take the money they should be spending on their own militaries to use for social programs _meta_end_dot_

 then unsurprisingly when we need their help militarily they re unable and worse yet unwilling to give us much of a hand _meta_end_dot_

 george washington once said the nation which indulges towards another a habitual hatred or a habitual fondness is in some degree a slave _meta_end_dot_

 it is a slave to its animosity or to its affection either of which is sufficient to lead it astray from its duty and its interest unfortunately we have developed a habitual fondness for europe in this country that has led us astray from our interest _meta_end_dot_

 yes our partnership with europe after world war ii was very beneficial during the cold war _meta_end_dot_

 however because of socialistic policies secularism and demographics western europe is starting to circle the drain _meta_end_dot_

 nato which was formed to keep the americans in the russians out and the germans down no longer has a purpose in the post cold war world and even if it did western europe s militaries have degraded so much that it s a hollow shell of a military alliance _meta_end_dot_

 that s not to say that we should tell western europe to take a hike and quit nato tomorrow but it is time to look beyond europe to find new allies that may be useful deep into the _meta_number_ref_st century _meta_end_dot_

 along similar lines what are we getting out of these peacekeeping missions that we undertake often at the behest of europe or the un _meta_end_question_

 nothing but expense hassles and sneers _meta_end_dot_

 let someone else do all the fighting next time somalia or kosovo blows up while we give moral support and contribute a few hundred non combat troops to help out _meta_end_dot_

 speaking of the united nations you could make an excellent case that we get very little out of membership in the un while that organization imposes a heavy burden on our country _meta_end_dot_

 the un is corrupt ineffective anti semitic and anti american _meta_end_dot_

 so why shouldn t we start working on a functional league of democracies that actually want to cooperate on a limited basis for the good of the world as we see it _meta_end_question_

 anything that weakens the un strengthens democracies and guards our country s sovereignty over time is probably a good thing isn t it _meta_end_question_

 plus over time as the league of democracies gets stronger perhaps we can end our membership in the united nations altogether and leave that organization in the dustbin of history where it belongs _meta_end_dot_

 next up is our policy in the middle east _meta_end_dot_

 we certainly need to do whatever it takes to keep iran from getting nuclear weapons and thereby starting a nuclear arms race across the middle east _meta_end_dot_

 we should also strive to find more effective ways to cripple and or eradicate terrorist organizations with a worldwide reach while we use soft power to promote democracy in the region and hamper radical islam _meta_end_dot_

 but let s talk about israel for a moment _meta_end_dot_

 we certainly need to continue to support our only true ally in the middle east but isn t it time that we bowed out of the peace process such as it is over there and let the europeans try their hand at it _meta_end_question_

 after all we ve been involved in trying to negotiate peace between the israelis and palestinians for decades and we haven t accomplished a thing beyond occasionally forcing the israelis to make bad deals so that an american president can wave around in a chamberlainesque fashion meaningless peace agreements that ultimately solve nothing _meta_end_dot_

 the fighting between the israelis and palestinians is probably going to continue indefinitely until one side or the other is slaughtered and driven off its land and all the jaw jaw in the world is unlikely to change that _meta_end_dot_

 so why not continue to support our friends the israelis but let someone else take a futile crack at making a peace agreement that isn t in the cards _meta_end_question_

 additionally since every candidate democrat and republican seems to be harping on energy independence in order to cut down the amount of oil money we re sending to the middle east perhaps we should actually drill for oil off the coast of florida california and in anwr _meta_end_dot_

 it also might be a fine idea to build some more nuclear power plants _meta_end_dot_

 we can build solar plants wind farms and plant switchgrass until the cows come home but it simply won t produce enough power to significantly reduce the amount of oil money we re sending overseas _meta_end_dot_

 at some point the politicians need to stop talking out of both sides of their mouths on this issue _meta_end_dot_

 if you want energy independence you need to support drilling along with more nuclear and coal plants _meta_end_dot_

 if you don t want to drill or build more nuclear and coal plants then you should stop pretending that you re serious about reducing our reliance on foreign oil _meta_end_dot_

 summing it all up this isn t a call for pacifism isolationism or even for a policy of non intervention _meta_end_dot_

 america does need to stay engaged in the world and there are times that we need to use force to ensure that our interests are protected _meta_end_dot_

 however we also need to have an america first foreign policy that is structured to deal with the problems and conditions of this century as opposed to the problems and conditions of the last century _meta_end_dot_
