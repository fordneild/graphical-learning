  will the growth in households with no landlines and only a cell phone begin to skew poll results in the near future _meta_end_question_

 some pollsters are concerned since the _meta_number_ref_s pollsters have relied on sampling techniques that depend on talking with people on their home land line telephones _meta_end_dot_

 for the most part the polls sample the public by randomly dialing telephone numbers in every region from a list of area codes and exchanges known to be residences _meta_end_dot_

 the sample is weighted to the results of the latest census _meta_end_dot_

 but cellphones are not geographically based forcing pollsters to adjust their methods _meta_end_dot_

 in addition a land line often represents a household and a cellphone often represents an individual _meta_end_dot_

 pollsters say they are also concerned about low response rates among people reached on cellphones _meta_end_dot_

 because wireless carriers charge customers by the minute people may be less likely to agree to complete lengthy cellphone surveys _meta_end_dot_

 the survey industry is exploring reimbursing respondents for minutes used _meta_end_dot_

 who are these adults with cellphones only _meta_end_question_

 according to data from the centers for disease control and prevention s national health interview survey adults with cellphones and no land lines are more likely to be young half of exclusively wireless users are younger than _meta_number_ref_ male hispanic living in poverty renting a residence and living in metropolitan regions _meta_end_dot_

 the pew research center conducted four studies last year on the differences between cellphone and land line respondents _meta_end_dot_

 the studies said the differences were not significant enough to influence surveys properly weighted to census data _meta_end_dot_

 with the increase in cellphone only households that may not be the case next year _meta_end_dot_

 researchers including the new york times cbs news poll will test that by incorporating cellphones in samples _meta_end_dot_

 if the percentage of adults living in cell only households continues to grow at the rate it has been growing for the past four years i have projected that it will exceed _meta_number_ref_ percent by the end of _meta_number_ref_ stephen j _meta_end_dot_

 blumberg a senior scientist at the national center for health statistics wrote in an e mail message _meta_end_dot_

 more here about the cell phone challenge as it applies to survey research _meta_end_dot_

 the difficulties in cell phone polling will only add to the challenges pollsters face _meta_end_dot_

 it will also present plenty of opportunities for error and abuse in determining sampling methods and weighting criteria _meta_end_dot_

 the bottom line is that during this transition period telephone polls will be even more error prone than ever _meta_end_dot_

 the only poll that counts is the poll on election day which is why avoiding election fraud of all kinds is of critical importance _meta_end_dot_

 the fact that polling results may be even more error prone than usual means that election fraud may also be more difficult to detect _meta_end_dot_

 handing out driver s licenses to non citizens failing to require photo identification from voters or prohibiting such requests for proof of identity allowing liberal use of absentee ballots and using unreliable vote counting systems without verifiable paper trails all create prime opportunities for abuse _meta_end_dot_

 we need extreme vigilance to maintain the integrity of our elections _meta_end_dot_

 if that integrity is undermined there is precious little left of our democracy _meta_end_dot_
