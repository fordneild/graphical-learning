  the brilliant penn jillette makes a living from being a skeptic _meta_end_dot_

 skepticism he reports in the la times isn t good enough for the reality based community however not on matters central to the canon s omeone asked us about global warming or climate change or however they re branding it now _meta_end_dot_

 teller and i were both silent on stage for a bit too long and then i said i didn t know _meta_end_dot_

 i elaborated on i don t know quite a bit _meta_end_dot_

 i said that al gore was so annoying that s scientifically provable right that i really wanted to doubt anything he was hyping but i just didn t know _meta_end_dot_

 i also emphasized that really smart friends who knew a lot more than me were convinced of global warming _meta_end_dot_

 i ended my long winded rambling i most often have a silent partner very clearly with i don t know i did that because _meta_end_dot_

 i don t know _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 the next day i heard that one of the non famous non groovy non scientist speakers had used me as an example of someone who let his emotions make him believe things that are wrong _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 later i was asked about a newsweek blog she wrote _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 she ends with but here was penn a great friend to the skeptic community basically saying don t bother me with scientific evidence i m going to make up my mind about global warming based on my disdain for al gore _meta_end_dot_

 which just goes to show not even the most hard nosed empiricists and skeptics are immune from the power of emotion to make us believe stupid things is there no ignorance allowed on this one subject _meta_end_question_

 _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 you can t turn on the tv without seeing someone hating ourselves for what we ve done to the planet and preaching the end of the world _meta_end_dot_

 maybe they re right but is there no room for maybe _meta_end_question_

 there s a lot of evidence but global warming encompasses a lot of complicated points is it happening _meta_end_question_

 did we cause it _meta_end_question_

 is it bad _meta_end_question_

 can we fix it _meta_end_question_

 is government forced conservation the only way to fix it _meta_end_question_

 _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 t he climate of the whole world is _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 complicated _meta_end_dot_

 i m not a scientist and i haven t spent my life studying weather _meta_end_dot_

 i m trying to learn what i can and while i m working on it isn t it ok to say i don t know _meta_end_question_

 i can t give jillette all the credit in the world for this thinking however _meta_end_dot_

 his skeptical principles of knowing when not to know only go so far _meta_end_dot_

 perhaps it really does matter whose ox is being gored because when it comes to other important matters arguably at least as complicated as global warming jillette is bold in his ignorance when in fact being so makes him feel good that is when he uses his lack of study knowledge or understanding to assert that there is no god _meta_end_dot_
