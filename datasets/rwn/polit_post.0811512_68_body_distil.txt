  you want to know why conservatives are so unmotivated this year _meta_end_question_

 honestly part of it is cyclical _meta_end_dot_

 conservatives have done so well at the ballot box for so long that a lot of people on the right have forgotten what it s like to stand by helplessly while liberals run the country into the ground _meta_end_dot_

 however the other part of the problem is that almost every person or organization in a leadership position in the gop is either a rino incompetent or some combination thereof _meta_end_dot_

 let s see _meta_end_dot_

 president bush there are a lot of nice things that can be said about the guy but over the last four years he has been one of the least adept politicians i have ever seen at the national level _meta_end_dot_

 john mccain conservatives should strongly prefer him to obama or hillary but he s a moderate who has deliberately tried to stick it to the right over and over again to pay them back for rejecting him as the party s nominee back in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 the rnc they do a decent job of raising money but they also refuse to do anything about a primary system that s slanted against conservatives they back rinos in primaries against conservatives and they haven t shown any conservative leadership on any issue that matters since ken mehlman left as chairman _meta_end_dot_

 the national republican congressional committee i have yet to see any evidence whatsoever that tom cole or anyone else over there has any idea what they re doing _meta_end_dot_

 the national republican senatorial committee the nrsc is a disaster zone which i don t blame on john ensign _meta_end_dot_

 ensign is a genuine conservative and a good guy who would probably be an excellent leader under different circumstances but taking over the nrsc after the _meta_number_ref_ elections was like taking the helm of the titanic after it hit the iceberg _meta_end_dot_

 the senate i m going to be generous and give mitch mcconnell a c for the job he has done running the senate _meta_end_dot_

 unfortunately after the terrible job the republicans in the senate did in the last election cycle they needed a leader who could grade out at the a level _meta_end_dot_

 the house the house leadership isn t perfect but john boehner roy blunt adam putnam and thad mccotter are the only gop leaders who seem to have their act together _meta_end_dot_

 they re conservative they re feisty and if all of the leadership of the gop was as solid as these guys the right would have a reason to feel proud of the gop again _meta_end_dot_
