  can iowa caucuses be polled _meta_end_question_

 john zogby asks can the iowa caucuses be polled accurately and then more or less answers the question _meta_end_dot_

 the premise is straightforward enough the iowa caucuses require voters to go to a local school church basement private home or similar meeting place to spend between _meta_number_ref_ minutes and two hours to register their preference _meta_end_dot_

 the process is a mixture of discussion debating a little horse trading and some consensus building between neighbors _meta_end_dot_

 anything can happen _meta_end_dot_

 not to mention that the democrats and republicans have very different processes for winnowing down the vote _meta_end_dot_

 given then that intensity matters much more so than in standard primary contests and that people wind up voting for their second or third choice candidate after the initial balloting isn t standard polling meaningless _meta_end_question_

 yes and no _meta_end_dot_

 zogby does a detailed analysis of his firm s polling for the _meta_number_ref_ democratic caucuses which went in a span of ten days from a two way race between frontrunner howard dean and dick gephardt to finishing off both men s chances of getting the nomination _meta_end_dot_

 when the final results of the caucuses were known the four candidates finished in exactly the order indicated by the zogby polls before the caucuses though the percentages were different because undecided voters had finally made up their minds _meta_end_dot_

 can we predict the exact results of the iowa caucuses ahead of time _meta_end_question_

 the answer is simple no _meta_end_dot_

 but that is not the purpose of political polling _meta_end_dot_

 as i mentioned earlier there is no way to predict the neighbor to neighbor dynamic inside a caucus setting and especially the effect that setting will have on those caucus goers who show up to the events yet undecided _meta_end_dot_

 but broad contours of the political landscape in iowa can be determined by pre caucus polling the rest is up to the voters _meta_end_dot_

 of course there s also more than a bit of luck involved _meta_end_dot_

 zogby s final pre caucus poll had john kerry howard dean and john edwards in a statistical dead heat _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 while he got the order right he certainly could not predict it with any confidence whatsoever with those numbers _meta_end_dot_

 so yes polling the iowa caucuses provides some valuable insights into what the voters are thinking and what trends we re likely to see _meta_end_dot_

 but unless it s a blowout the polling isn t particularly helpful in handicapping the horse race _meta_end_dot_
