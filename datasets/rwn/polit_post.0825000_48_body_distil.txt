  if i were a celebrity i would never get publicly involved in a political race _meta_end_dot_

 know why _meta_end_question_

 because the wider your appeal is to the public the more popular you are and therefore the more money you make and when you start getting involved in partisan politics you alienate half the population _meta_end_dot_

 that brings us to oprah winfrey _meta_end_dot_

 oprah has gone all out for barack obama and now she is refusing to give sarah palin a slot on her show the item in today s drudge report is categorically untrue _meta_end_dot_

 there has been absolutely no discussion about having sarah palin on my show _meta_end_dot_

 at the beginning of this presidential campaign when i decided that i was going to take my first public stance in support of a candidate i made the decision not to use my show as a platform for any of the candidates _meta_end_dot_

 i agree that sarah palin would be a fantastic interview and i would love to have her on after the campaign is over now certainly it s oprah s show and she can do what she wants with it but by supporting barack obama and refusing to allow sarah palin to appear on her show she just gave the finger to every conservative woman who watches her show and for what _meta_end_question_

 i have to tell you as far as i can see oprah s support hasn t done much of anything to help barack obama _meta_end_dot_

 that s usually the way it goes by the way _meta_end_dot_

 there are only a handful of cases in the last few years when a celebrity has made any difference at all in a political campaign chuck norris and michael j _meta_end_dot_

 fox are the only two that immediately come to mind _meta_end_dot_

 along these same lines heart getting all huffy about the mccain campaign using barracuda as a theme for sarah palin is a similarly dumb mistake _meta_end_dot_

 it s a twenty year old song and having it associated with the mccain campaign can only make more money for heart while complaining about palin using it can only take money out of heart s pocket _meta_end_dot_

 what s wrong with taking the sort of classy approach that big boi from outkast did when he found out their song bombs over baghdad was being used to rally the troops _meta_end_question_

 we make a record and then it is up to people to take what they want from it he said by phone this week from his home base in atlanta _meta_end_dot_

 we explain a song when people ask but we can t control how they feel about it _meta_end_dot_

 in our case fans know where we stand pretty much _meta_end_dot_

 i talk to them in the street all the time _meta_end_dot_

 i really think bush should have gone through the united nations before going over there _meta_end_dot_

 but once the fighting starts everything changes _meta_end_dot_

 you have guys over there with families here and you have to support the troops and pray for them _meta_end_dot_

 so if the song helps them keep their spirits up i don t have a problem with that see _meta_end_question_

 he still got his message out that he opposed the war but he did it in a way that didn t turn anyone off _meta_end_dot_

 that s smart _meta_end_dot_

 if you re a professional entertainer there are a lot of ways you can make an impact on the world without alienating your fans _meta_end_dot_

 oprah heart and some of these other churlish celebs would be better off if they figured that out _meta_end_dot_
