  yesterday the gop candidates with the exception of tom tancredo participated in a spanish language debate on univision _meta_end_dot_

 now some people may pan them for participating in a spanish language debate but i m not one of them _meta_end_dot_

 to the contrary i believe that we need to take every opportunity to show hispanics that although we are dead serious about illegal immigration the democrats are wrong about our being anti hispanic _meta_end_dot_

 just by showing up last night and saying the same things they always do our candidates helped send that message _meta_end_dot_

 unfortunately i don t get univision so i didn t get to watch the debate _meta_end_dot_

 however i have read the transcript and judging by the frequent applause the candidates seem to have been well received and here are a few replies that stood out to me for one reason or another operator governor huckabee is there a risk standing up here inaudible _meta_end_question_

 huckabee well i think the great risk is not so much that we would come _meta_end_dot_

 the far greater risk is if we didn t _meta_end_dot_

 and it s not just that we would offend or perhaps insult the hispanic audience of this country _meta_end_dot_

 i think it would insult our own party _meta_end_dot_

 it would insult every voter in this country _meta_end_dot_

 to act like that somehow we ve become so arrogant that there s any segment of our population that we re either afraid to speak to hear their questions or somehow that we don t think that they re as important as another group _meta_end_dot_

 and it s why i think whether it s an african american audience a hispanic audience a union audience as republicans we ought to be more than willing to sit down even with people with whom we might know there are disagreements _meta_end_dot_

 and i think frankly it s important for us to be here _meta_end_dot_

 it s important that you gave us this opportunity _meta_end_dot_

 and i want to say thanks for letting us have this audience on univision _meta_end_dot_

 applause moderator tonight your answers are being translated into spanish interpreted inaudible _meta_end_dot_

 thirty one million people in the united states speak spanish here _meta_end_dot_

 the census shows that _meta_end_dot_

 we re going to start with senator mccain _meta_end_dot_

 do you think that there would be a value a practical value of making english the official language in this country _meta_end_question_

 mccain i think the most practical value is to make english used by all americans and all citizens and all who come here _meta_end_dot_

 the only way _meta_end_dot_

 applause the only way we move up the economic ladder from the bottom rung is to know english _meta_end_dot_

 and i would emphasize the importance of every person who comes to this country to become a citizen and enjoy its liberties and beauty is to learn english _meta_end_dot_

 and i will do everything i can to help them do that _meta_end_dot_

 applause moderator senator thompson we were preparing this forum and we found a survey from los angeles times that said that _meta_number_ref_ percent of the voters in the united states think that they are in favor of granting legal status to undocumented aliens if they meet certain criteria _meta_end_dot_

 why if the majority supports that why not support that idea _meta_end_question_

 thompson because we have to enforce our borders and we have to uphold the law _meta_end_dot_

 there are millions of people who have stood in line in embassies around the world united states embassies waiting to become american citizens waiting to become legal residents of the united states of america _meta_end_dot_

 some places such as hong kong i read it takes an average of _meta_number_ref_ years to go through that process _meta_end_dot_

 the legal process needs to be reformed indeed _meta_end_dot_

 but when they finally come here and when they are joined by those people in latin america who have often fought tyranny who have fought against the castro regime who have come here and risked their lives to become united states citizens when all those people come here they become a part of us they become a part of our family _meta_end_dot_

 it would disrespect them if we said other people who had not obeyed the law and had not gone through the process to set them above them and to give them special status above those who have obeyed the law and fought so hard to become good american citizens and legal residents _meta_end_dot_

 applause moderator congressman hunter why not support the legalization _meta_end_question_

 hunter listen when i was when i came back from vietnam i was a practicing lawyer in the barrio _meta_end_dot_

 i was the only lawyer there and i never turned away a family that came in and needed help _meta_end_dot_

 but i told them a couple of things _meta_end_dot_

 one thing is you have to be here legally because the first thing you ve got to learn in this country is the rule of law _meta_end_dot_

 and the second thing is you have to make sure that your kids learn english because that is the american opportunity _meta_end_dot_

 now in _meta_number_ref_ we gave an amnesty and when we gave that amnesty _meta_number_ref_ million people came in who were allowed to stay in who were here illegally _meta_end_dot_

 we said at that point no more and we re not going to let anybody else come in _meta_end_dot_

 after that _meta_number_ref_ million more people came in _meta_end_dot_

 if we give an amnesty to this next batch of _meta_number_ref_ million people you will have a third wave of people coming in expecting to catch the third amnesty _meta_end_dot_

 you know this lady behind me represents a lot of things _meta_end_dot_

 one is welcoming immigrants to america _meta_end_dot_

 the other is the rule of law _meta_end_dot_

 we have to establish the rule of law and people who are here illegally have to go home _meta_end_dot_

 applause moderator governor romney we would like to know see what your opinion what s going to happen to the children who are being separated from their families _meta_end_question_

 romney we re going to finally have a system that welcomes people here legally and that says that those that have come here illegally are invited to get in line with everybody else _meta_end_dot_

 and the constitution as senator thompson has indicated indicates that those that are born here do become united states citizens by virtue of being born here _meta_end_dot_

 but if they re born here from parents who come across the border illegally and bring them here illegally in my view we should not adopt then these chain migration policies that say you ve got a child here that s a u s _meta_end_dot_

 citizen and the whole family can come in _meta_end_dot_

 that in my opinion is a mistake _meta_end_dot_

 we are a nation of laws _meta_end_dot_

 and you re correctly going through each part of immigration policy here _meta_end_dot_

 but let s underscore this one more time we are in this audience almost every person here an individual who came to this country because it s a land of opportunity and liberty _meta_end_dot_

 we also because we have laws can have opportunity and liberty _meta_end_dot_

 we re going to enforce the laws _meta_end_dot_

 welcoming people here we re not going to cut off immigration we re going to keep immigration alive and thriving _meta_end_dot_

 but we re going to end the practice of illegal immigration _meta_end_dot_

 it s not inhumane _meta_end_dot_

 it s humanitarian _meta_end_dot_

 it s compassionate _meta_end_dot_

 we re going to end illegal immigration to protect legal immigration _meta_end_dot_

 applause moderator it s the presidential forum the republican one _meta_end_dot_

 we re going to talk about something else _meta_end_dot_

 now we re going to talk about latin america _meta_end_dot_

 a week ago exactly a week ago venezuela rejected changes to the constitution but the president hugo chavez _meta_end_dot_

 applause president hugo chavez has insisted that he s going to propose them again _meta_end_dot_

 many consider him a threat to democracy in the region _meta_end_dot_

 if you were elected president how would you deal with chavez _meta_end_question_

 let s start with congressman john paul ron paul sorry _meta_end_dot_

 paul well he s not the easiest person to deal with but we should deal with everybody around the world the same way with friendship and opportunity to talk and try to trade with people _meta_end_dot_

 audience booing paul we talked to we talked to stalin we talked to khrushchev we ve talked to mao and we ve talked to the world and we get along with people _meta_end_dot_

 actually i believe we re at a time where we even ought to talk to cuba and trade and travel to cuba _meta_end_dot_

 audience booing applause but let me let me tell you let me tell you why let me tell you why we have a problem in south america and central america because we ve been involved in their internal affairs for so long _meta_end_dot_

 we have been meddling in their business _meta_end_dot_

 applause we create the chavezes of the world we create the castros of the world by interfering and creating chaos in their countries and they respond by throwing out their leader _meta_end_dot_

 audience booing applause moderator thank you congressman _meta_end_dot_

 moderator when talking about cuba cuban dictatorship has survived nine u s _meta_end_dot_

 presidents _meta_end_dot_

 what would you do differently that has not been done so far to bring democracy to cuba _meta_end_question_

 we re going to start with senator thompson _meta_end_dot_

 thompson i m going to make sure that he didn t survive _meta_number_ref_ u s _meta_end_dot_

 presidents _meta_end_dot_

 laughter the next question of course if regarding iraq _meta_end_dot_

 congressman hunter surveys show that two out of three hispanics think that the united states should withdraw its troops from iraq _meta_end_dot_

 how would you convince them of the fact that they should stay there the troops should stay there _meta_end_question_

 hunter well you know there s lots of hispanic americans serving in iraq _meta_end_dot_

 and my son came back from his third tour as a u s _meta_end_dot_

 marine on thanksgiving having served in iraq twice and afghanistan _meta_end_dot_

 applause and you know if you check with the hispanics of the _meta_number_ref_st marine division or the _meta_number_ref_th army division of the _meta_number_ref_st cavalry you ll get a lot different poll than the poll that you re telling me right now because the young men and women who are serving over there know we can win in iraq _meta_end_dot_

 applause and let me tell you what they ve done _meta_end_dot_

 with blood sweat and tears they have brought down the attack rate in anbar province by _meta_number_ref_ percent _meta_end_dot_

 they brought it down over the entire nation _meta_end_dot_

 the iraqi army is now standing up all _meta_number_ref_ battalions _meta_end_dot_

 that government s going to hold and the army s going to hold and we are going to leave iraq in victory and we re going to leave an iraq that will be a friend not an enemy of the united states _meta_end_dot_

 applause so we re going to be victorious in iraq and hispanic americans who serve there know that _meta_end_dot_

 applause mayor giuliani how can we curb the high cost of healthcare and also offer insurance to the people who don t have it _meta_end_question_

 giuliani the very best way to do it and senator mccain is on the right track but it has to be more more of an incentive for people to buy their own health insurance _meta_end_dot_

 we only have _meta_number_ref_ million americans who buy their own health insurance _meta_end_dot_

 if we had _meta_number_ref_ million or _meta_number_ref_ million americans who were the cost of health insurance would probably be cut in half or more than half and a lot of people could afford it the way this person is asking us how can you do it _meta_end_dot_

 so you give people a _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ for a family tax deduction tax exemption to buy their own health insurance _meta_end_dot_

 you encourage them to do it _meta_end_dot_

 you also give them a health savings account to up to _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ or _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ so that they can then look for deductibles in insurance _meta_end_dot_

 and it brings down the cost of insurance _meta_end_dot_

 that s one of the primary ways to do it _meta_end_dot_

 and then you break down the barriers where people can only buy in one state and you let them buy in any state so that we can set up a real competition _meta_end_dot_

 the thing that works in america is not socialized medicine that the democrats want to bring us not government control not mandates but a large consumer market where you empower people to enter that market is the only way to bring down costs and to bring up quality _meta_end_dot_

 applause moderator well we have the last question for all of you _meta_end_dot_

 hispanics are the biggest minority in the united states and by _meta_number_ref_ we re going to be _meta_number_ref_ percent of the population _meta_end_dot_

 three months ago i asked the same thing to the democratic candidates _meta_end_dot_

 what would you think would be the biggest contribution from hispanics but we want to ask you what is the role what role do you think hispanics will play in the development of our nation and our society _meta_end_question_

 we re going to start with governor huckabee _meta_end_dot_

 huckabee on our coins it says e pluribus unum it means out of many one _meta_end_dot_

 ronald reagan said it best _meta_end_dot_

 he said that if we go to germany we re not germans and if we go to italy we re not italians _meta_end_dot_

 but anyone who comes to america is an american _meta_end_dot_

 one of the great aspects of this nation is that when people come here and unite with us they share not just our borders and our boundaries _meta_end_dot_

 they share our hopes and our dreams and our aspirations _meta_end_dot_

 and if there s any one reason that this country is a magnet for people and clearly a magnet for many hispanics who have found hope and opportunity here it s because they see in this country what we ourselves who live here see _meta_end_dot_

 and that is that here we can dream great dreams and actually can see them _meta_end_dot_

 our equality is not based on our ancestry our last name it s not based on how much money we make _meta_end_dot_

 it s based on the intrinsic worth and value that every one of us have _meta_end_dot_

 it s why we share something else and i think that this nation is basically pro life because we recognize that intrinsic worth _meta_end_dot_

 and i think what we offer is an opportunity to raise families and to live dreams and to be free _meta_end_dot_
