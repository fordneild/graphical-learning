  a measure of hypocrisy is necessary to a functioning society _meta_end_dot_

 it s quite possible on the one hand to be opposed to the legalization of prostitution yet on the other to pull your hat down over your brow every other tuesday and sneak off to the cat house on the other side of town _meta_end_dot_

 your inability to live up to your own standards does not in and of itself nullify them _meta_end_dot_

 the left gives the impression that a republican senator caught in a whorehouse ought immediately to say you re right _meta_end_dot_

 i should have supported earmarks for hookers in the _meta_number_ref_ appropriations bill that s the reason why sex scandals take down republicans but not democrats sex wise the left s standards are that whatever s your bag is cool which is the equivalent of no standards _meta_end_dot_

 thus monica lewinsky was a grown woman free to make her own decisions on the carpet of the oval office _meta_end_dot_

 without agreed moral standards all you have is the law _meta_end_dot_

 when it s no longer clear something is wrong all you can do is make it illegal mark steyn the flesh is weak and we human beings often do foolish things that conflict with our own moral values _meta_end_dot_

 not to excuse the hypocrisy of that but who s the better person the fellow who advocates high moral standards and falls short occasionally or the person who never falls short because he advocates living an immoral life _meta_end_question_

 clearly the former is the better husband the better father the better christian and just plain old better for our society _meta_end_dot_

 hypocrisy is a notable failing but there are still far worse things than hypocrisy _meta_end_dot_

 the virtue of a federalist republican form of government is that the more you push these decisions down to the level where people actually have to live with their consequences the more likely it is they will be a involved and interested in the decision making process and b happy with the result _meta_end_dot_

 federalism is also morally superior because it requires the consent of the governed at the most basic level _meta_end_dot_

 sure your side can lose an argument but it s easier to change things locally than nationally _meta_end_dot_

 and at the end of the day if you don t get your way there s always the highway _meta_end_dot_

 it s easier to move to the next state than it is to move to canada jonah goldberg the likelihood of a decision being wise is often inversely proportional to how far removed the decision maker is from the person directly affected by the decision _meta_end_dot_

 this is why it s so disturbing to see the federal government trying to regulate everything from what kind of tv we can own to the sort of light bulbs we have in our homes _meta_end_dot_

 even the most dull witted bunglers in the mountains of appalachia or the outskirts of berkeley probably have a much better handle on their own individual circumstances how to make themselves happy and how to spend their own money than a ph d from harvard with a genius level iq who s sitting in washington d c _meta_end_dot_

 patriotism is as much a virtue as justice and is as necessary for the support of societies as natural affection is for the support of families benjamin rush it is patriotism that helps transform a mere stranger to a countryman that under the right circumstances a man will help and defend sometimes at the cost of his own life _meta_end_dot_

 for love of country people will donate money toil for countless hours in the most thankless of jobs and even take up arms if necessary _meta_end_dot_

 such a noble urge should be encouraged taught to our children at every opportunity and honored for the good it does for our society _meta_end_dot_

 the accumulation of wealth is a process which is of itself morally neutral _meta_end_dot_

 true as christianity teaches riches bring temptations _meta_end_dot_

 but then so does poverty margaret thatcher too many people in our society have been persuaded that most rich people have at worst done something immoral to become so wealthy or at best that they re merely lucky _meta_end_dot_

 although there are some people who fit that description most affluent people got that way by serving their fellow man in some form or fashion _meta_end_dot_

 moreover these successful people often tend to pay enormous sums in taxes and employ large numbers of people directly or through their purchases _meta_end_dot_

 that is something to be admired and encouraged not frowned upon lest we learn the tragic lesson of aesop s farmer who killed the goose that laid the golden egg _meta_end_dot_

 it is not the critic that counts not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles or the doer of deeds could have them better _meta_end_dot_

 the credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood who strives valiantly who errs and comes short again and again because there is no effort without error and shortcoming but he who does actually strive to do the deed who knows the great devotion who spends himself in a worthy cause who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement and who at the worst if he fails while daring greatly knows that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who know neither victory nor defeat teddy roosevelt we live in a microwave society where we expect everything right now exactly the way we want it with zero mistakes _meta_end_dot_

 that s not the real world _meta_end_dot_

 human beings are not robots and yes we make mistakes fall short and disappoint _meta_end_dot_

 it s not a bad thing to have high standards but there s very little to be said for destroying men s entire careers for a single thoughtless statement demanding that politicians address our every problem to make us happy or expecting soldiers to never make an honest mistake in the middle of a war zone _meta_end_dot_

 put another way excellence is achievable but perfection is not _meta_end_dot_

 tolerant but not stupid _meta_end_exclamation_

 look just because you have to tolerate something doesn t mean you have to approve of it _meta_end_exclamation_

 tolerate means you re just putting up with it _meta_end_exclamation_

 you tolerate a crying child sitting next to you on the airplane or you tolerate a bad cold south park for all of us to live in an open free society with a wide variety of different views we have to be able to tolerate a variety of widely diverging opinions _meta_end_dot_

 however this is not enough for some people who insist that we treat every opinion and lifestyle choice as equally valid and healthy for society _meta_end_dot_

 but what they are failing to understand is that there is a difference between tolerance and acceptance _meta_end_dot_

 just because you can do something doesn t always mean you should _meta_end_dot_

 diversity worship and multiculturalism are currency and cause for celebration at just about any college _meta_end_dot_

 if one is black brown yellow or white the prevailing thought is that he should take pride and celebrate that fact even though just as in the case of my eye color he had nothing to do with it _meta_end_dot_

 the multiculturist and diversity crowd see race as an achievement _meta_end_dot_

 in my book race might be an achievement worthy of considerable celebration only if a person was born white and through his effort and diligence became black walter williams race based groups like the naacp the kkk la raza and the american nazi party do very little good and much harm to our country _meta_end_dot_

 in fact the very idea that something as arbitrary as skin color should determine people s actions beliefs and political party is odious and un american _meta_end_dot_

 moreover it has long been apparent that the sort of ethnic tribalism inevitably displayed by people in these race based groups is actually more of a source of strife in our country than the racism they are supposedly combating _meta_end_dot_

 the inherent vice of capitalism is the unequal sharing of blessings the inherent virtue of socialism is the equal sharing of miseries winston churchill there are many reasons why people should prefer capitalism over socialism _meta_end_dot_

 one of the most compelling is that it is better to be poor while still having the opportunity to become wealthy through your own efforts than to be poor and have little opportunity to advance but to share your fate with almost everyone else _meta_end_dot_

 people sleep peaceably in their beds at night only because rough men stand ready to do violence on their behalf george orwell because we humans are such short lived creatures we tend to have a myopic view of the world _meta_end_dot_

 we think that because we re civilized everyone else is just as civilized _meta_end_dot_

 however the truth is that nations like america are the exception and the rule historically has been little more than the law of the jungle _meta_end_dot_

 the world is full of evil men with bad intentions who will take more than a mile if you give them an inch _meta_end_dot_

 when we forget that and think we can just talk out every difference with our foreign enemies who have sworn to kill us or begin to treat home grown criminals in our jails like they re victims of society instead of victimizers who got where they are by preying on their fellow citizens there is always a heavy price to be paid _meta_end_dot_

 when government does occasionally work it works in an elitist fashion _meta_end_dot_

 that is government is most easily manipulated by people who have money and power already _meta_end_dot_

 this is why government benefits usually go to people who don t need benefits from government _meta_end_dot_

 government may make some environmental improvements but these will be improvements for rich bird watchers _meta_end_dot_

 and no one in government will remember that when poor people go bird watching they do it at kentucky fried chicken p j _meta_end_dot_

 o rourke it s always amusing to hear a politician rail against special interests because when they begin naming names you ll notice that they always seem to be the groups that are influential with the other political party _meta_end_dot_

 so what inevitably happens when a different political party takes power _meta_end_question_

 the old special interests are shoved to the side people cheer and then shortly thereafter the new special interests are catered to and the cycle starts anew _meta_end_dot_

 the key to stopping this behavior isn t to change parties or put some new rule in place it s to get the government out of the business of handing out favors in the first place _meta_end_dot_
