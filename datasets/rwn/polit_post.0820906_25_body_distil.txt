  written by kender and crossposted from staclu as if the aclu s hypocrisy regarding the boy scouts and religious organizations weren t enough now we have them stepping up and stating the evidence you have is old in its latest filing before the federal district court in dallas on behalf of the islamic society of north america isna and its affiliate organization the north american islamic trust nait in the hamas terrorism financing case the aclu has made a noteworthy admission _meta_end_dot_

 rather than deny that there is copious evidence tying isna and nait to hamas and the muslim brotherhood the brief argues that such evidence is merely dated _meta_end_dot_

 in a curious footnote on page _meta_number_ref_ the reply states assuming the authenticity of documents dates the most recent documents to mention either isna or nait are dated _meta_number_ref_ gov _meta_end_dot_

 exhs _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ and _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ but the majority of the documents are older _meta_end_dot_

 almost all of the numerous exhibits that purport to show financial transactions and that contain any mention of isna or nait are dated _meta_number_ref_ and _meta_number_ref_ there are two dated _meta_number_ref_ almost a decade before the majority of the overt acts the government alleges in support of its conspiracy charges against the hlf defendants _meta_end_dot_

 so isna and nait are not saying that the documents tying their organizations to hamas are inauthentic but that the problem with the evidence is just that it is old _meta_end_dot_

 then even more curiously the reply goes on to argue something that the government has not even alleged even if the evidence provided some basis for alleging criminality against petitioners the government s discussion of it shows the government utterly fails to grasp the singular weight and consequence that an official accusation of criminal conduct carries in our criminal justice system and in our society _meta_end_dot_

 but of course the government has not charged isna or nait with criminal conduct or the two groups would be indicted in their own right rather than un indicted co conspirators who worked with the holy land for relief and development hlf the defendant and alleged hamas front _meta_end_dot_

 the reply brief then as shakespeare might write doth protest too much the aclu is one of the most dangerous organizations in this country today _meta_end_dot_

 their defense of our enemies is mind boggling and possibly treasonous _meta_end_dot_

 i for one can t wait to see them brought up on charges of sedition and tossed in gitmo to watch some guard try to flush their holy book down the commode _meta_end_dot_

 chalk it up to the aclu s penchant for defending the bad guy standing with evil and against all that is good _meta_end_dot_

 when the scores are tallied someday the aclu will go down in history along with other groups that have worked so hard to destroy civilization and enslave humanity like the khmer rouge the soviets che guevara chairman mao hitler the visigoths and all of mohammed s followers throughout history _meta_end_dot_
