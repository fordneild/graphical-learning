  there s a big stink because foxnews ran a segment about michelle obama and the caption included thewords barack obama s baby mama _meta_end_dot_

 one could argue that the phrasefurther dumbs down the american language and is a racial epithetunsuitable for prime time _meta_end_dot_

 or one could argue that the hip hop culturehas come to define at least part of the culture at large and embracethe language _meta_end_dot_

 or one could do either depending on the circumstances _meta_end_dot_

 michelle obama used the term baby daddy to introduce her husband so clearly she does not find the languageoffensive _meta_end_dot_

 i m guessing that increases her cred on the street yo _meta_end_dot_

 or maybe it s just a fun light hearted thing to say _meta_end_dot_

 wait i think itmight be the latter _meta_end_dot_

 however is it wrong for others to describe ms _meta_end_dot_

 obama as barack s babymama _meta_end_question_

 is baby mama like the n word only appropriate in the blackman s mouth _meta_end_question_

 which i disagree with by the way to me the n word isoffensive no matter who uses it but anyone who wants to use it can firedog lake is characteristically hysterical _meta_number_ref_ she s well educated a lawyer and a black woman unleash the hounds is saying baby mama unleashing the hounds _meta_end_question_

 now i ll grant you that no one is probably going to describe mccain swife cindy as a baby mama but i doubt you ll hear cindy mccainintroduce her husband as her baby s daddy _meta_end_dot_

 she knows how silly itwould sound coming from the potential future president s wife s mouth _meta_end_dot_

 ohwait _meta_end_dot_
