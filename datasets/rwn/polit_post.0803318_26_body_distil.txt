  if you don t know who lynne stewart is allow me to briefly educate you _meta_end_dot_

 she is a disbarred terrorist sympathizing lawyer that thinks the blind sheik was a remarkable man _meta_end_dot_

 she faced up to _meta_number_ref_ years for conspiring with a terrorist and got a slap on the wrist of _meta_number_ref_ months in october of last year _meta_end_dot_

 last we heard about her she was planning on teaching ethics of all things _meta_end_dot_

 what else can i say _meta_end_question_

 i agree with michelle malkin and the ny post _meta_end_exclamation_

 nevertheless district judge john koeltl decided that stewart had performed a public service _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 to the nation in representing blind sheik omar abdel rahman regardless of any well _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 overzealousness in his cause _meta_end_dot_

 yet stewart went far beyond legal work in the service of abdel rahman the architect of the _meta_number_ref_ world trade center bombing and numerous other plots against new york city landmarks _meta_end_dot_

 despite an explicit pledge to uphold abdel rahman s court ordered isolation stewart a jury found smuggled in messages from terrorist rifa l ahman tara urging the sheik to support renewed islamic violence in egypt then smuggled out a coded dispatch that torpedoed a cease fire between the sheik s terror organization and the egyptian government _meta_end_dot_

 if that s not abetting terrorism it s hard to say what is _meta_end_dot_

 nor was this just some innocent mistake by a starry eyed naif stewart a hardened radical boasted during trial of her belief that entrenched institutions will not be changed except by violence and you can t always single out the combatants from the non combatants unfortunately koeltl appears to have at least one booster on the panel _meta_end_dot_

 i find the work judge koeltl did admirable to a degree that is amazing said judge guido calabresi who is famous himself for comparing president bush s election to the rise of hitler and mussolini _meta_end_dot_

 amazing sure but admirable _meta_end_question_

 try disgusting _meta_end_dot_

 the plain fact is that lynne stewart broke her promise and the law in helping her terrorist client collude with his underlings when no one else could _meta_end_dot_

 twenty eight months for that is an insult to justice and dangerous to boot _meta_end_dot_

 lynne stewart is the kind of scum sucking traitor that makes me wonder why we ever outlawed public hanging _meta_end_question_
