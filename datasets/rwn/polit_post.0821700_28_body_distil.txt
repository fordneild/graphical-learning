  alexander solzhenitsyn died _meta_end_dot_

 two years ago this october on the occasion of the even of elections i wrote on dean s world the following about how and why i became a conservative _meta_end_dot_

 that story began with alexander solzhenitsyn i recognized that i was a conservative during high school when in support of a paper i was writing on solzhenitsyn in a senior year comparative literature class my ethnic polish teacher gave me a stack of american spectator magazines one of which included an article on solzhenitsyn by malcolm muggeridge _meta_end_dot_

 the entire gestalt of it just spoke sense to me _meta_end_dot_

 was it a reaction to the tepid petrified left wing jewish labor socialism of my extended family _meta_end_question_

 the anger of a first generation american on one side at a society that seemed remember i grew up in the _meta_number_ref_ s so inexcusably and utterly unwilling to defend itself against what anyone could see was subversion _meta_end_question_

 common sense as a princeton friend later dropout and current washington operator would later describe it when recruiting me for some reagan era campus political social suicide mission _meta_end_question_

 maybe it was just the natural inclination of one identified as depressingly adultoid from an absurdly young age and whose picture can be found at the wikipedia entry for stick in the mud i don t really know but i do remember that when i told my college roommate that i had upon my return from an israel program for jewish searchers become committed to religious observance he said well now at least your religious ethic matches your political one or words to that effect _meta_end_dot_

 be that as it may it is truth to me even though politics and most politicians turn my stomach _meta_end_dot_

 i mean there is some ethic in there isn t there _meta_end_question_

 but at the end of the day these democrats are the ones who so undermined the world i remember growing up in and they continue to do so today _meta_end_dot_

 they are not even in the league for patriotism and love of country and decency of the democratic politicians of my early youth lyndon johnson roberty kennedy hubert humphrey _meta_end_dot_

 with mcgovern that ended _meta_end_dot_

 jimmy carter sealed the deal _meta_end_dot_

 he made being an american embarrassing humiliating depressing hopeless _meta_end_dot_

 wimpy _meta_end_dot_

 apologetic _meta_end_dot_

 cringing _meta_end_dot_

 losing _meta_end_dot_

 i don t believe any of today s democratic leaders have improved on jimmy carter except that he had the benefit of not having to kowtow as today s democrats do so grossly to identity politics of every right and privilege demanding ethnic and social subcultural group no matter how subversive to the hard left on abortion rights and he was allowed to be some kind of public christian _meta_end_dot_

 i wish there were republicans today who had a quarter of the qualities of ronald reagan _meta_end_dot_

 here was a great man one who never claimed for himself the mantle of a perfect or even particularly virtuous personal life but he loved his country knew right from wrong and exercising a quality that i admire for the very scold it places on one such as myself his ability now proved doubly and triply to make everyone around him think he was a dumbbell when in fact he was sly as a fox _meta_end_dot_

 frankly i think george w _meta_end_dot_

 bush comes quite close to these qualities _meta_end_dot_

 but sadly lacking the gipper s ability to communicate and being the literal heir to a political tradition of some ideological infirmity to a conservative think jim baker the man who made me vote for bill clinton in _meta_number_ref_ he is not reagan nor are the dizzy denizens of the capitol statesmen by and large _meta_end_dot_

 were they ever _meta_end_question_

 the past takes on an undeserved elegance in sepia _meta_end_dot_

 the crassness of living live and unsilenceable color makes today s professional political class seemingly harder to swallow than its predecessors red or blue _meta_end_dot_

 but every time i step into the booth i ask myself if this candidate could choose ronald reagan or jimmy carter to make the keynote speech at his or her party s nominating convention which one would he or she choose _meta_end_question_

 the choice is simple _meta_end_dot_

 cross re posted on likelihood of success _meta_end_dot_
