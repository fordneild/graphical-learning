  ben stein has been getting flogged mercilessly on the left and right for saying this stein when we just saw that man i think it was mr _meta_end_dot_

 myers i e _meta_end_dot_

 biologist p z _meta_end_dot_

 myers talking about how great scientists were i was thinking to myself the last time any of my relatives saw scientists telling them what to do they were telling them to go to the showers to get gassed that was horrifying beyond words and that s where science in my opinion this is just an opinion that s where science leads you _meta_end_dot_

 crouch that s right _meta_end_dot_

 stein love of god and compassion and empathy leads you to a very glorious place and science leads you to killing people _meta_end_dot_

 crouch good word good word _meta_end_dot_

 stein didn t phrase that very eloquently but the point he seems to be trying to make is that science divorced from religious ethics can become a monstrous thing indeed _meta_end_dot_

 that is hardly a controversial notion _meta_end_dot_

 in fact you ve probably seen more than a few horror sci fi movies that have this as their central premise _meta_end_dot_

 for example just to name a few there s equilibrium resident evil alien re animator and frankenstein _meta_end_dot_

 if you want real life examples of what happens when science is untethered from morality there are plenty of those too including the nazi experiments that stein mentioned more examples here _meta_end_dot_

 a world where people sit around all day singing kumbaya in a cave would be a terrible place to live _meta_end_dot_

 however a world where science is unencumbered by religious ethics would likely be just as horrible _meta_end_dot_

 i believe that was the point stein was trying to get across _meta_end_dot_

 hat tip to little green footballs for the story _meta_end_dot_
