  to be honest i seldom watch the cable news shows anymore because they re too slow compared to the blogosphere _meta_end_dot_

 usually these shows mainly consist of the hot story of the day repeated ad nauseum material the blogosphere covered days earlier guests spinning and being asked questions primarily designed not to allow them to inform but to trip them up and fluff like the hot white chick of the day who has been kidnapped _meta_end_dot_

 that really is only tangentially related to this post which engages in some of the same sins that the cable networks normally do but i felt the need to vent _meta_end_dot_

 in any case the point was that someone told me one of the hot stories recently was jennifer love hewitt and her fat pictures _meta_end_dot_

 which fat pictures you ask _meta_end_question_

 don t you want to ask that _meta_end_question_

 because if you do ask that it means i get to show you her bikini shots and not for a prurient reason because she s hot but because it s news _meta_end_exclamation_

 so since you asked wink wink here are the shots that have prompted people to call jennifer love hewitt fat courtesy of egotastic _meta_end_exclamation_

 is jennifer love hewitt fat _meta_end_question_

 only by the unrealistic standards of bony fashion models who look like they might eat half a finger sandwich every _meta_number_ref_ or _meta_number_ref_ days which is pretty much the point that hewitt made a size _meta_number_ref_ is not fat _meta_end_exclamation_

 nor will it ever be _meta_end_dot_

 and being a size _meta_number_ref_ doesn t make you beautiful _meta_end_dot_

 agreed _meta_end_dot_

 in fact do you want to know a little secret _meta_end_question_

 although some ultra skinny women can pull off that look most men would far prefer a woman who looks like hewitt to a twin of hers who was say _meta_number_ref_ pounds lighter and flatter _meta_end_dot_

 but really these unrealistic standards of beauty have become pretty commonplace _meta_end_dot_

 for example not too long ago maxim put out a list of the five unsexiest women alive that included among others i kid you not britney spears amy winehouse sarah jessica parker _meta_end_dot_

 if that s your idea of hideously ugly then well ok let s be honest it isn t your idea of hideously ugly _meta_end_dot_

 that s just something internet dorks pop off about because no one in real life would ever sit around with their buddies at work telling them that the girl in the next cubicle who looks exactly like britney spears is some sort of hideous cow or would they _meta_end_question_

 which brings me to a theory i have about the internet becoming a major factor in the decline of birthrates in the west _meta_end_dot_

 let me explain _meta_end_dot_

 imagine that you were alive a couple of hundred years ago _meta_end_dot_

 there was no tv back then no internet no glossy women s mags no sports illustrated swimsuit issue nothing _meta_end_dot_

 there were also no cars or airplanes which meant that it was much more difficult to travel _meta_end_dot_

 long story short the average man or woman got to see meet and talk to at least compared to today a very small number of people _meta_end_dot_

 because of that it was much easier again comparatively for someone to be considered a knockout an incredible conversationalist or a potentially suitable mate because the pool of talent was so much smaller _meta_end_dot_

 but today people aren t just competing with the people in their town they re competing in looks and personality with movie stars super models and winners from all across the country _meta_end_dot_

 when a man thinks to himself is she attractive he s not just comparing the woman in question to people that live in his town he s comparing her to mariah carey natalie portman the hot model he saw in a toothpaste commercial and every other woman he finds attractive _meta_end_dot_

 when a woman thinks to herself does he have a great personality she s not just comparing him to people that live in her town she s comparing him to her favorite tv star and the guy she has been talking to from across the country on instant messenger _meta_end_dot_

 all this leads to is unrealistic expectations declining birthrates and people calling jennifer love hewitt fat at least that s my theory _meta_end_dot_
