  paul craig roberts whose main claim to fame is being an assistant secretary of the treasury in the reagan administration who later became ultra liberal and ultra insane has written a completely crackers column about iraq for counterpunch _meta_end_dot_

 just read these excerpts t he american sheeple have accepted a succession of transparent lies weapons of mass destruction al qaeda connections and complicity in the _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ attack overthrowing a dictator and bringing democracy to iraqis _meta_end_dot_

 the fact is that bush invaded iraq with the intent of turning iraq into an american colony _meta_end_dot_

 the so called government of al maliki is not a government _meta_end_dot_

 maliki is the well paid front man for us colonial rule _meta_end_dot_

 maliki s government does not exist outside the protected green zone the headquarters of the american occupation _meta_end_dot_

 the more likely explanation for the us invasion of iraq is the neoconservative bush regime s commitment to the defense of israeli territorial expansion _meta_end_dot_

 there is no such thing as a neoconservative who is not allied with israel _meta_end_dot_

 israel hopes to steal all of the west bank and southern lebanon for its territorial expansion _meta_end_dot_

 an american colonial regime in iraq not only buttresses israel from attack but also can pressure syria and iran from giving support to the palestinians and lebanese _meta_end_dot_

 the iraqi war is a war for israeli territorial expansion _meta_end_dot_

 americans are dying and bleeding to death financially for israel _meta_end_dot_

 bush s war on terror is a hoax that serves to cover us intervention in the middle east in behalf of greater israel you know what the saddest thing about the american left is _meta_end_question_

 they hate bush so much and are so desperate to lose the war in iraq because they think it will help them politically that they will swallow the sort of nonsense roberts writes wholesale _meta_end_dot_

 hell roberts could have written that bush let the jews carry out the _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ attacks on purpose so he could make a mint selling iraqi sand on the open market and it wouldn t have even make a liberal blogger bat an eye _meta_end_dot_

 the only things they care about are is bush a bad guy _meta_end_question_

 check _meta_end_dot_

 do we have to lose the war in iraq no matter what the circumstances are _meta_end_question_

 check _meta_end_dot_

 is america the bad guy _meta_end_question_

 check _meta_end_dot_

 check all the boxes and just about anything that doesn t involve space aliens or crab people that a lefty says about iraq will get most liberals nodding their heads like bobblehead dolls _meta_end_dot_
