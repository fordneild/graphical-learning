  i just finished reading obama s speech and he is pretty clearly trying to have it both ways on jeremiah wright _meta_end_dot_

 first of all after condemning wright s unpatriotic and racist comments of late which quite frankly aren t all that surprising given that he has a history of making similar comments obama goes on to say given my background my politics and my professed values and ideals there will no doubt be those for whom my statements of condemnation are not enough _meta_end_dot_

 why associate myself with reverend wright in the first place they may ask _meta_end_question_

 why not join another church _meta_end_question_

 and i confess that if all that i knew of reverend wright were the snippets of those sermons that have run in an endless loop on the television and you tube or if trinity united church of christ conformed to the caricatures being peddled by some commentators there is no doubt that i would react in much the same way but the truth is that isn t all that i know of the man _meta_end_dot_

 the man i met more than twenty years ago is a man who helped introduce me to my christian faith a man who spoke to me about our obligations to love one another to care for the sick and lift up the poor _meta_end_dot_

 he is a man who served his country as a u s _meta_end_dot_

 marine who has studied and lectured at some of the finest universities and seminaries in the country and who for over thirty years led a church that serves the community by doing god s work here on earth by housing the homeless ministering to the needy providing day care services and scholarships and prison ministries and reaching out to those suffering from hiv aids _meta_end_dot_

 and this helps explain perhaps my relationship with reverend wright _meta_end_dot_

 as imperfect as he may be he has been like family to me _meta_end_dot_

 he strengthened my faith officiated my wedding and baptized my children _meta_end_dot_

 not once in my conversations with him have i heard him talk about any ethnic group in derogatory terms or treat whites with whom he interacted with anything but courtesy and respect _meta_end_dot_

 he contains within him the contradictions the good and the bad of the community that he has served diligently for so many years _meta_end_dot_

 i can no more disown him than i can disown the black community _meta_end_dot_

 i can no more disown him than i can my white grandmother a woman who helped raise me a woman who sacrificed again and again for me a woman who loves me as much as she loves anything in this world but a woman who once confessed her fear of black men who passed by her on the street and who on more than one occasion has uttered racial or ethnic stereotypes that made me cringe _meta_end_dot_

 i m sure that fred phelps of god hates f gs infamy has led some people to christ and done some ministering but that doesn t mean a politician can just excuse his offensive comments with a gosh those comments about gay people were offensive but he s like a crazy uncle _meta_end_dot_

 everybody has had a crazy uncle right _meta_end_question_

 i can no more disown fred phelps than i can disown the white community if obama intends to continue to embrace this guy then despite what he s saying to the contrary he isn t all that offended by what he s saying _meta_end_dot_

 in fact it s entirely possible that he agrees with everything wright is saying and is only putting a little bit of distance between himself and wright s bigoted anti american comments because he feels like he has to do so politically _meta_end_dot_
