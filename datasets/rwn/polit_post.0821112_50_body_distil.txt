  my co blogger melissa clouthier and i disagreed about who s more romantic men or women _meta_end_dot_

 so we decided to debate the topic on im and let rwn s readers vote on it _meta_end_dot_

 what follows is an edited transcript of our discussion and at the end a poll _meta_end_dot_

 dr _meta_end_dot_

 melissa clouthier i believe men are more romantic about relationships and the women they love while women are more pragmatic in their choices for a mate _meta_end_dot_

 john hawkins men tend to be much more looks centered than women but i don t think that equates to romance _meta_end_dot_

 dr _meta_end_dot_

 melissa clouthier well i think that looks are a big part of it that attraction without evidence of personality or intelligence or whatever _meta_end_dot_

 john hawkins yeah but a guy can be incredibly attracted to a woman he has zero romantic feeling for _meta_end_dot_

 dr _meta_end_dot_

 melissa clouthier exactly _meta_end_dot_

 john hawkins exactly what _meta_end_question_

 dr _meta_end_dot_

 melissa clouthier which is why i don t think looks is the only part of it _meta_end_dot_

 lots of guys are attracted to lots of women but falling in love takes on a different quality and what i ve seen is that when a guy views a woman as the one his sense goes out the door _meta_end_dot_

 it s not just looks _meta_end_dot_

 john hawkins very true but that doesn t make him romantic _meta_end_dot_

 dr _meta_end_dot_

 melissa clouthier well what s your definition of romantic _meta_end_question_

 john hawkins having strong feelings for a woman doesn t equal romance _meta_end_dot_

 dr _meta_end_dot_

 melissa clouthier what s your definition of romance _meta_end_question_

 maybe we re not talking about the same thing _meta_end_dot_

 john hawkins i think you just know it when you see it like pornography _meta_end_dot_

 dr _meta_end_dot_

 melissa clouthier i guess i m not even saying it s flowers and candles and gifts and that is probably equated with romance and romance novels classically although i ve never read one except for somewhere in time _meta_end_dot_

 john hawkins well who does read them _meta_end_question_

 women read pretty much all of them while men won t touch romance novels _meta_end_dot_

 i mean that says something about who s more romantic _meta_end_dot_

 dr _meta_end_dot_

 melissa clouthier but i m saying that men once they love a woman stick to an idealized version of her and women are more pragmatic _meta_end_dot_

 john hawkins i don t know that they stick to an idealized version _meta_end_dot_

 dr _meta_end_dot_

 melissa clouthier i think they do _meta_end_dot_

 john hawkins it s hard to have an idealized version of someone after you have been with them for a while _meta_end_dot_

 i mean if you re wondering who s more affected by or likely to want to engage in what are commonly thought of as romantic gestures it is definitely women _meta_end_dot_

 dr _meta_end_dot_

 melissa clouthier well here s the thing women read romance novels true but men and me too read fantasy and they are equally romantic _meta_end_dot_

 john hawkins really they re not _meta_end_dot_

 dr _meta_end_dot_

 melissa clouthier in my opinion for example lotr the motivation for aragorn is his love for his woman arwen _meta_end_dot_

 john hawkins there is usually a romantic story in fantasy and sci fi novels but is also almost always secondary to the plot _meta_end_dot_

 for example the love story in lotr was secondary to the plot dr _meta_end_dot_

 melissa clouthier it was _meta_end_dot_

 john hawkins in a romance novel or romantic comedy which women eat up with a spoon it s central _meta_end_dot_

 dr _meta_end_dot_

 melissa clouthier but i feel like it was more romantic than the swirling confection of a romance novel _meta_end_dot_

 john hawkins the men go to watch sci fi to see the action the adventure the special effects and maybe get a little romance as frosting _meta_end_dot_

 with women it is the whole cake _meta_end_dot_

 women will go to the movies to see a male female love story _meta_end_dot_

 men will not _meta_end_dot_

 that suggests that women are more romantic _meta_end_dot_

 dr _meta_end_dot_

 melissa clouthier i so disagree with you _meta_end_dot_

 john hawkins are you arguing that men are as into romance movies as women _meta_end_question_

 i don t know anybody who thinks that or romance novels _meta_end_question_

 are men as into them as women _meta_end_question_

 dr _meta_end_dot_

 melissa clouthier i am not saying anything about who goes to movies or reads novels _meta_end_dot_

 i m talking actions and i m saying women might sigh at romance but their actions are pragmatic _meta_end_dot_

 john hawkins well we are talking about romance tho women love those movies and books because they love the idea of romance _meta_end_dot_

 men for the most part don t _meta_end_dot_

 dr _meta_end_dot_

 melissa clouthier men dismiss romance but their actions are romantic _meta_end_dot_

 women like it in theory but in reality they are marrying someone for economic stability reasons john hawkins some of them do _meta_end_dot_

 dr _meta_end_dot_

 melissa clouthier lots do _meta_end_dot_

 life isn t like movies or books _meta_end_dot_

 a man doesn t think that way _meta_end_dot_

 he might consider her if she d be a good mother _meta_end_dot_

 john hawkins well men are expected to provide and very few guys would ever have the option of marrying a woman who could just take of them financially _meta_end_dot_

 even if they did they would be ashamed to marry her for that reason _meta_end_dot_

 dr _meta_end_dot_

 melissa clouthier women might read these books about being swept off their feet but i m sorry if they find out the guy who is sweeping is a deadbeat the romance ends _meta_end_dot_

 john hawkins but if men are more romantic why aren t they the ones reading the books _meta_end_question_

 dr _meta_end_dot_

 melissa clouthier because i m not defining romance by the novels or movies _meta_end_dot_

 john hawkins i am not either but i find what people are interested in tells you a lot about them _meta_end_dot_

 also attraction works differently for men and women _meta_end_dot_

 for men it s almost entirely looks _meta_end_dot_

 for women it s a whole passel of manly attributes including looks _meta_end_dot_

 dr _meta_end_dot_

 melissa clouthier and that is why a woman feels a sense of loss or can after marriage when the guy doesn t do the things he did but he tends to feel it if he s really swept away even if he doesn t show it john hawkins nothing because men don t value romance _meta_end_dot_

 dr _meta_end_dot_

 melissa clouthier make a meal i guess or buy nice lingerie _meta_end_dot_

 john hawkins women value romance which is why men pretend to be romantic to make them happy _meta_end_dot_

 dr _meta_end_dot_

 melissa clouthier ha yes they do but women never pretend at it _meta_end_dot_

 that s what i m saying john hawkins because men wouldn t care _meta_end_dot_

 dr _meta_end_dot_

 melissa clouthier women aren t romantic _meta_end_dot_

 they read it they watch it but men are the true romancers in action and i believe in heart _meta_end_dot_

 john hawkins why should women make some grand romantic gesture the guy won t care about when he would be much happier if she cooked him a nice meal and took him upstairs for some hot monkey sex _meta_end_question_

 dr _meta_end_dot_

 melissa clouthier i m really afraid of how this whole conversation is going to be edited _meta_end_dot_

 john hawkins you should be afraid _meta_end_dot_

 d ehr of nothing _meta_end_dot_

 it will be edited very fairly _meta_end_exclamation_

 john hawkins most men act romantic not because they feel that way but because they know it will make women happy _meta_end_dot_

 dr _meta_end_dot_

 melissa clouthier now that s cynical _meta_end_dot_

 that s like saying that most women have sex not because they want to but because it will make men happy _meta_end_dot_

 john hawkins women enjoy sex too and would want it even if men were so so on it _meta_end_dot_

 men wouldn t bring women flowers for example if women didn t appreciate it or at least if they didn t think that they did _meta_end_dot_

 dr _meta_end_dot_

 melissa clouthier hmmm _meta_end_dot_

 well i am not talking about flowers and chocolates _meta_end_dot_

 i m talking about feelings the way a person feels inside _meta_end_dot_

 i still say that men are more devoted that way _meta_end_dot_

 john hawkins those are classic romantic gestures though that happen because a woman appreciates romance and men want to make her happy _meta_end_dot_

 dr _meta_end_dot_

 melissa clouthier i guess it must work because people do it but that is not what i m talking about and i guess i m not making myself clear _meta_end_dot_

 john hawkins i know you are talking about the feelings _meta_end_dot_

 dr _meta_end_dot_

 melissa clouthier i am talking about the motivation a man has john hawkins a man can love a woman with all his heart and never say the words to her throughout his whole life _meta_end_dot_

 love doesn t equal romance dr _meta_end_dot_

 melissa clouthier it captures what i m trying to express perfectly _meta_end_dot_

 john hawkins a man can be deeply in love and not be romantic _meta_end_dot_

 dr _meta_end_dot_

 melissa clouthier a man who is deeply in love is romantic _meta_end_dot_

 john hawkins only if you treat love and romance as synonymous _meta_end_dot_

 dr _meta_end_dot_

 melissa clouthier i m not using them that way _meta_end_dot_

 john hawkins ok we are never going to agree on this obviously so do you just want to agree i am right and leave it at that _meta_end_question_

 dr _meta_end_dot_

 melissa clouthier no way _meta_end_dot_

 john hawkins ok then we ll have to put up a poll and let rwn s readers decide that s a wrap d who s more romantic _meta_end_question_
