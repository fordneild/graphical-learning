  uh oh it looks like barack obama has offended some of the liberals over at the daily kos for finally taking some reluctant half hearted shots at the anti white anti american conspiracy nut he has used as a sounding board and a spiritual mentor _meta_end_dot_

 here s daily kos diarist kaos_meta_number_ref_ playing the race traitor card on obama i have been a huge supporter of barack _meta_end_dot_

 he is the guy i ve been behind for quite awhile now _meta_end_dot_

 check my older diaries if you wonder about that _meta_end_dot_

 and while i ve been steeling myself for a barack loss in november because i think the repug machine is too good for him to beat i had resigned myself to still working hard for him and for the progressive cause _meta_end_exclamation_

 but today something changed for me _meta_end_dot_

 today the scales fell from my eyes and i saw barack obama for what he truly is a weak man and a standard politician _meta_end_dot_

 i really never thought i would say this _meta_end_dot_

 but i am disgusted with him _meta_end_exclamation_

 i just watched barack throw someone who has been a huge part of his life overboard because a bunch of white bread advisors told him he had to _meta_end_dot_

 and why _meta_end_question_

 because white america was freaked out by a black preacher _meta_end_exclamation_

 unfortunately barack has decided that he doesn t need black votes to win _meta_end_dot_

 i m sure he was told by his white advisors that black folk will support him anyway _meta_end_dot_

 so why not come out and disrespect the whole community _meta_end_dot_

 barack didn t transcend black white politics rather he chose to become white _meta_end_exclamation_

 all because some white folks on cnn were appalled that rev wright didn t shuffle in and say yes massa _meta_end_dot_

 i ve been saying for awhile that i thought barack would likely lose in november _meta_end_dot_

 now i am wondering if i don t hope he loses _meta_end_exclamation_

 if you want to know why obama still has yet to disown wright at least in part it probably has something to do with the fact that there are significant numbers of liberals who see putting distance between yourself and a guy accusing the government of creating the aids virus to kill black americans as saying yes massa to whitey _meta_end_dot_

 who d have thunk it _meta_end_question_

 hat tip to little green footballs for the story _meta_end_dot_
