  it seems impossible that _meta_number_ref_ years have passed since the controversial decision by the ayala family who chose to get pregnant with a baby to save their daughter annisa who suffered with leukemia _meta_end_dot_

 she needed a bone marrow transplant to save her life but there were no matches _meta_end_dot_

 her parents had another child who ended up being the perfect match _meta_end_dot_

 both girls are alive and well today _meta_end_dot_

 watch the whole story here _meta_end_dot_

 an ethicist made the argument that it was wrong to have a child and before the baby could consent herself take her bone marrow to save her sister _meta_end_dot_

 i watched the family imagined watching my daughter die and can see making the same decision _meta_end_dot_

 the thought did occur to me though what if the child wasn t a match _meta_end_question_

 how would that reality affect the family _meta_end_question_

 after the older daughter died would the new child be a solace or source of pain _meta_end_question_

 that s a lot to put on a child _meta_end_dot_

 i m sure the parents thought this through _meta_end_dot_

 what say you _meta_end_question_

 i would have made the same decision as the ayalas agree disagree pollcode com free polls this case also reminded me of end of life decisions too _meta_end_dot_

 no one likes to talk about it but i know for a fact that parents children and doctors make tough choices every single day in hospitals across america _meta_end_dot_

 the terri schiavo case was especially divisive because of the nature of her husband s relationship and the questionable circumstances surrounding her coma _meta_end_dot_

 at any rate her case wasn t typical _meta_end_dot_

 most people at the end are suffering and the question is whether to intervene and end it or less overtly just remove the life support or should nature be allowed to take it s course meaning that the person dies when the body quits _meta_end_dot_

 again i m curious about your reaction to this dilemma _meta_end_dot_

 at the end people should end the suffering if they want _meta_end_dot_

 let nature take its course _meta_end_dot_
