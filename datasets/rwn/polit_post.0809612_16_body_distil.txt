  some leftist wet was calling conservative radio yesterday giving this little potted speech about how rev _meta_end_dot_

 wright can t be criticized because hey dr _meta_end_dot_

 king said similar stuff _meta_end_dot_

 dennis prager s response to the guy was as always calm and thoughtful but i liked dennis miller s better well if martin luther king really said that america was the biggest purveyor of violence in the world well then guess what _meta_end_question_

 he was wrong about that and then he hung up on the guy _meta_end_dot_

 martin luther king wasn t jesus _meta_end_dot_

 he was a man _meta_end_dot_

 a flawed man who did great things and bad things _meta_end_dot_

 he is not your pet or your imaginary friend _meta_end_dot_

 he did not live and die in order to validate your liberal worldview parking tickets forty years later and into perpetuity _meta_end_dot_

 the mere talismanic mention of his name inevitably uttered as a cross between abracadabra and so there does not it is my sad duty to inform you invoke in all of us the same overarching awe it does in you or strike the rest of us dumb in the wake of his imaginary infallibility _meta_end_dot_

 when you thoughtlessly play the martin luther king card you always think you re laying down a royal flush and you reach for the pot too soon _meta_end_dot_

 but some of us just see four jokers and reach for our guns _meta_end_dot_

 the _meta_number_ref_s are over _meta_end_dot_

 try harder _meta_end_dot_
