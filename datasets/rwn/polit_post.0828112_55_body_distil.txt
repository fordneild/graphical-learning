  one of the most amusing things about the clinton obama primary season was watching bill n hill s outrage at the upstart obama besting them at their own say anything game _meta_end_dot_

 and like the clinton s of yore it worked for obama _meta_end_dot_

 obama played dirty and any hit back was protested with pained charges of racism _meta_end_dot_

 obama is doing the same thing with mccain and palin _meta_end_dot_

 palin especially is handling obama s sly game well _meta_end_dot_

 but it does serve a purpose to look at the greater character of the man for as his tactical predecessor bill clinton demonstrated this propensity to play the opposition and really the american people reveals a narcissism and contempt for americans that can lead to troublesome behavior _meta_end_dot_

 this behavior reminds me of the high school hot jock he treats his girlfriend like dirt because she s dumb enough to dig him when it s obvious he s a player and everyone paying attention knows it _meta_end_dot_

 obama shows a disturbing level of contempt for the american people _meta_end_dot_

 jennifer rubin says in her article hypocrisy doesn t even begin to describe it but more than hypocrisy is at work here _meta_end_dot_

 it is not just far left american hating radicals he now disowns _meta_end_dot_

 you get the sense that he believes everyone can be played _meta_end_dot_

 rashid khalidi can believe that obama finds no one suffers more than the palestinians _meta_end_dot_

 jews can buy that he was moved by the holocaust from a summer camp experience _meta_end_dot_

 voters in his congressional race in _meta_number_ref_ can be told that there is no difference ideologically between him and _meta_percent_ref_ ada rated bobby rush but the rest of the state in _meta_number_ref_ and eventually the country can buy that he s a post partisan reformer _meta_end_dot_

 terrorists come to believe he shares their scorn for america but iowa voters hear him talk about his appreciation that only in america could his story have happened _meta_end_dot_

 primary voters in ohio are coddled with protectionist promises and then privately scorned while he is talking to san fransciso liberal donors _meta_end_dot_

 there is no end to it everyone gets the version of obama that perfectly fits his own world view _meta_end_dot_

 it is not hypocrisy _meta_end_dot_

 it s fraud _meta_end_dot_

 whatever he told or shared with ayers dohrn wright or pfleger counts for no more that what he told or shared with other now inconvenient groups and individuals _meta_end_dot_

 he s sold the same piece of political real estate to multiple buyers for multiple conflicting uses _meta_end_dot_

 so obama s acorn affiliations can be ignored and the implications for what this affiliation means as president is off limits _meta_end_dot_

 and so far the press has colluded with obama _meta_end_dot_

 it will be interesting to see if the press starts honestly reporting to inoculate themselves against the blame should obama win the presidency and turn out to have played them too _meta_end_dot_

 in order to be played there has to be a desire to play _meta_end_dot_

 so far the press has enjoyed the game _meta_end_dot_

 as long as they get to be the girlfriend they ve been happy _meta_end_dot_

 obama is just that good _meta_end_dot_
