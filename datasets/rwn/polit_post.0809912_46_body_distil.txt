  john fund writes on the democrats opposition to free trade with colombia _meta_end_dot_

 in a time when both democratic candidates are promising to improve our foreign relations both are flunking this key test of leadership _meta_end_dot_

 colombia is a democratic ally fighting off a vicious marxist insurgency being aided by the autocratic regime of hugo ch vez _meta_end_dot_

 president alvaro uribe is fighting to keep his country from becoming a tool of ch vez s hegemonic ambitions and trying to prevent narcotics from funding terrorism _meta_end_dot_

 he has done a great deal to stop the violence that has ravaged colombia the murder rate has dropped precipitously under his leadership and the marxist farc guerillas have been unable to destabilize the government and turn colombia into a communist puppet state _meta_end_dot_

 yet the democratic party has decided to turn against colombia for reasons that reek of politics rather than substance president uribe made clear how disappointed he was that the democratic front runner had chosen domestic politics over geopolitical stability i deplore the fact that sen _meta_end_dot_

 obama _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 should be unaware of colombia s efforts he said in a statement _meta_end_dot_

 i think it is for political calculations that he is making a statement that does not correspond to colombia s reality the simple truth is that the opposition to the trade agreement from the democratic presidential contenders to house speaker nancy pelosi has nothing to do with reality _meta_end_dot_

 rep _meta_end_dot_

 charles rangel chairman of the house ways and means committee admitted as much recently it s not the substance on the ground it s the politics in the air the reality is that colombia is not a threat to american workers _meta_end_dot_

 the free trade agreement submitted for ratification lowers trade barriers on both sides and gives us manufacturers greater access to colombia s markets _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_percent_ref_ of good coming from colombia are already imported duty free _meta_end_dot_

 the argument that this bill would be injurious to the interests of american workers has absolutely no basis nor do the attacks against president uribe accusing him of attacking union organizers in colombia _meta_end_dot_

 the democratic party has developed a knee jerk reaction to anything that resembles free trade and for a party that claims the progressive mantle that sort of isolationism is a throwback to the days of nativist protectionism _meta_end_dot_

 what s worse is that it compromises the democrats promises that they will restore america s reputation abroad exactly why should anyone trust us if we re willing to slander one of our strongest regional allies in latin america _meta_end_question_

 if the democrats rhetoric on international relations was more than empty words they would be working to ensure that president uribe is not threatened by his neighbors and would be pledging to support his democratic government _meta_end_dot_

 instead both candidates are engaged in a war of words against an american ally _meta_end_dot_

 that is hardly the way to go about restoring our image abroad _meta_end_dot_
