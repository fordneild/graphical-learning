  glenn reynolds links to these alarming statistics brought to us by the tax prof a key finding of the report is the partner status of full time faculty academic partner _meta_percent_ref_employed non academic partner _meta_percent_ref_single _meta_percent_ref_stay at home partner _meta_percent_ref_ well if the professors weren t screwing students they were screwing each other and then screwing the students _meta_end_dot_

 because of the inbreeding a student who pisses off one prof hooked up with another prof risks a double whammy _meta_end_dot_

 what this little analysis doesn t say is what percent of the employed non academic partners work for the school _meta_end_dot_

 i ll bet it s a big percentage _meta_end_dot_

 so don t tangle with someone in the administration either because he or she is likely married to a professor who teaches a required class _meta_end_dot_

 they talk _meta_end_dot_

 and yes to be clear i am suggesting that professors are human and a part of the grading comes down to how much they don t hate you if there is any subjective grading _meta_end_dot_

 there s a couple profs who actually seem to like students but for the tenured folk the liking the students schtick was a pretense that was left behind twenty years ago back to inbreeding i ll just put it this way the creative learning environment seems to be the same well that other um creative energy comes from and professors have a lot of creative energy _meta_end_dot_

 as long as it s well channeled the students are usually safe _meta_end_dot_

 usually _meta_end_dot_
