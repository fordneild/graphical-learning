  over at the atlantic faux conservative andrew sullivan says a nuclear iran is fine with him and that the people who are concerned about it are really just doing the bidding of those sneaky jews _meta_end_exclamation_

 on the iran question there can be little doubt that waging a pre emptive war on the persian regime is now the principal policy objective of the neocon right _meta_end_dot_

 to elect mccain is almost certainly to endorse a new war with iran within the next four years _meta_end_dot_

 again this could be justified on the grounds of america s interests and not israel s _meta_end_dot_

 but again the case is getting a little harder to make _meta_end_dot_

 the world and the west can live after all with a deterred and contained nuclear iran _meta_end_dot_

 israel cannot _meta_end_dot_

 mccain and lieberman hold the podhoretz position on iran obama is a few pragmatic notches away _meta_end_dot_

 those notches minor to most observers nonetheless render obama unacceptable to the jewish right _meta_end_dot_

 even after his aipac speech _meta_end_dot_

 let s consider what living with nuclear iran would mean _meta_end_dot_

 first of all we would not just be living with a nuclear iran we would be living with a nuclear iran a nuclear syria a nuclear iraq a nuclear saudi arabia a nuclear egypt a nuclear kuwait etc etc etc _meta_end_dot_

 for all their anti israeli bluster the nations in that region understand that israel has nukes for defensive purposes _meta_end_dot_

 they may hate the israelis but they understand that they re fundamentally moral people with no interest in conquering the region _meta_end_dot_

 but iran _meta_end_question_

 iran is run by fanatical maniacs with a history of supporting terrorism and making outlandish and violent threats _meta_end_dot_

 if iran builds nukes all the other nations in the region that are capable of acquiring or building nuclear weapons will do so out of fear of what iran will do with their nuclear weapons _meta_end_dot_

 now once we get to that point and we have _meta_number_ref_ or _meta_number_ref_ unstable dictatorships in nations full to the brim with anti american anti israeli religious fanatics how long do you think it will take for a nuclear weapon to be used in israel or the united states _meta_end_question_

 people like sullivan would say oh but if they fire a nuke at israel or the united states we ll eradicate them _meta_end_exclamation_

 deterrence worked with the soviets here s the problem if they give the nuclear weapons to a terrorist group and a suicide bomber detonates it in tel aviv or for that matter los angeles new york and houston whom do we eradicate in retaliation _meta_end_question_

 the iranians _meta_end_question_

 the saudis _meta_end_question_

 the syrians _meta_end_question_

 the idea that we will definitively know where the nuclear weapon that destroys a city comes from would seem to be a very iffy assumption _meta_end_dot_

 the next step and i have actually heard people suggest this is that we nuke every nation in the region with nukes if we re hit _meta_end_dot_

 are we really going to do that _meta_end_question_

 are we going to fire off nukes and kill _meta_number_ref_ million people atop the world s oil supply all of whom had nothing to do with nuking us _meta_end_question_

 hell we get squeamish about killing a dozen civilians when we re going after high value terrorist targets as is _meta_end_dot_

 what makes anyone think that the sort of person who will plausibly become president of the united states will have the terrible will required to kill _meta_number_ref_ million innocent people to make sure the people responsible for hitting us suffer too _meta_end_question_

 ps i don t think putting mccain in office means a war with iran and i would certainly hope it would never come to that but if we got down to the unpleasant choice between war with iran and letting them have nukes i would unquestionably favor war with iran _meta_end_dot_

 the consequences of doing otherwise which would likely include nuclear weapons going off in multiple us cities without our knowing where they came from would be unthinkable _meta_end_dot_
