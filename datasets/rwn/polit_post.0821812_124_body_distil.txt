  my pal rachel lucas got a question from one of her readers that read i m a former liberal who s made a difficult transformation to a conservative i m hopeful that you ll consider a post on how a conservative can deal with liberals in the situation that the liberals are loving and caring family members _meta_end_dot_

 any advice _meta_end_question_

 on how to make a point while remaining civil and un excommunicated _meta_end_question_

 here s how you deal with friends family members and random people you re meeting on the street who are liberal _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ avoid talking about politics in the first place _meta_end_dot_

 i mean if you think george bush is the truman of his time a man who will be vindicated by history for bringing freedom to the middle east and your friend thinks he s hitler it s going to be hard to bridge the gap especially since there are probably _meta_number_ref_ issues where you have that big of a disagreement _meta_end_dot_

 so try to stay away from politics in general _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ be big enough to handle disagreements _meta_end_dot_

 if you can t handle the fact that your friend thinks michael moore is a cinematic genius and that barack obama is a lightbringer then how are you going to be able to hold up your end of the friendship _meta_end_question_

 you have to just realize that you re not going to agree on some very important issues and deal with it _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ correct them gently _meta_end_dot_

 i hate to be this blunt but in my experience the average person thinks it s very important to know about politics but simultaneously is horribly uninformed about the subject compared to the typical person who reads blogs listens to talk radio etc _meta_end_dot_

 so as a general rule most people believe all sorts of things that are ridiculous completely incorrect that some friend of a friend told them etc _meta_end_dot_

 with that in mind if you are well informed it s generally very easy to make them look like an idiot _meta_end_dot_

 don t do this _meta_end_dot_

 feel free to politely disagree with them if they are wrong and then move on _meta_end_dot_

 if they ask for a follow up explain your opinion in neutral language and then try to move on from politics _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ do you want to be friends or do you want to prove you re right _meta_end_question_

 i m not saying you should go along to get along because i don t believe in doing that but people get very sensitive about how little they know about politics _meta_end_dot_

 if you rub it in their faces or make them look like idiots which incidentally is what generally makes for a good blog post d it s going to upset them _meta_end_dot_

 it s one thing to do that to liberal bloggers or liberals in a comment section whom you probably don t care about one way or the other but it s another thing to do that to your friends and family _meta_end_dot_

 so let them know you disagree but don t make a huge issue out of it or humiliate them _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ remember that people are not groups _meta_end_dot_

 as a group liberals suck _meta_end_dot_

 they re dishonest selfish hedonistic and slowly eating away at everything that s good decent and worthwhile about american society _meta_end_dot_

 however your friend or a family member is not liberals he s just a person _meta_end_dot_

 treat him like an individual and don t try to make him bear the sins of liberals everywhere _meta_end_dot_

 that s too heavy of a burden for anyone to bear _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ just realize it may not work _meta_end_dot_

 i find that there are liberals and then there are fanatical liberals _meta_end_dot_

 liberals who aren t all that into politics you can have fairly normal discussions with _meta_end_dot_

 on the other hand the fanatical liberals tend to infuse politics into every part of their life and if you are conservative they genuinely see you as a bad person just because you don t agree with them _meta_end_dot_

 realistically you re probably not going to be able to be friends with someone like that no matter how great you are as a friend unless you want to be a doormat who spends all your time getting browbeaten and pretending you agree with him _meta_end_dot_
