  a while back in washington i was approached modestly by a man named jim edwards who asked if he could tell me a little about his organization numbersusa _meta_end_dot_

 i soon realized that this was a group i had supported and whose emails i still regularly receive so i was happy to find out more about it _meta_end_dot_

 jim also known as dr _meta_end_dot_

 james r _meta_end_dot_

 edwards jr i found out later is a leading consultant of numbersusa adjunct fellow at the hoover institute author and prominent public policy expert whose writings have been published by the new york times national review online the washington times and my absolute favorite magazine human events _meta_end_dot_

 for one with such an impressive resume i found jim to be astonishingly humble good natured and approachable _meta_end_dot_

 jim explained to me that numbersusa organized in _meta_number_ref_ is a grassroots nonpartisan organization that organizes around the issue of immigration with over half a million activists throughout the country the group has been making an increasing impact on both local and federal legislation _meta_end_dot_

 in fact numbersusa played a large part in stopping mccain kennedy and since then has grown significantly _meta_end_dot_

 currently a major goal of the organization is to help pass the secure america with verification and enforcement save act through congress which was introduced surprisingly by democrat congressman heath schuler from north carolina _meta_end_dot_

 the save act is a fair and practical response to the problem of illegal immigration which as jim stated is geared at closing down the jobs magnet that attracts foreigners to enter the u s _meta_end_dot_

 illegally by targeting the employers who hire them with firm penalties _meta_end_dot_

 employers would further be mandated to confirm that all their workers are legally eligible for their jobs _meta_end_dot_

 most recently numbersusa is asking concerned citizens to learn about the save act call their congressmen to get this bill on the floor and send them a free fax to stress your concern _meta_end_dot_

 jim emphasized that the issue of illegal immigration has become a bipartisan issue and the bill has been picking up cosponsors from both parties such as senators mark pryor d ar and david vitter r la _meta_end_dot_

 offering some statistics that should raise an eyebrow or two jim then revealed that our immigration flow historically has been an average of _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ per year from _meta_number_ref_ to _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 now however we ve taken in over a million immigrants each year and this accounts only for legal immigration _meta_end_dot_

 futher he cited robert rector of the heritage foundation when you take into account all the taxes that immigrant legal and illegal households pay vs _meta_end_dot_

 the entitlements public benefits they receive the average is a subsidy of _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ a year _meta_end_dot_

 cause for concern anyone _meta_end_question_

 nonetheless jim and the rest of numbersusa seem hopeful about their efforts _meta_end_dot_

 the best strategy to do something about this issue by small incremental steps change incentives so more illegals leave on their own and fewer enter _meta_end_dot_

 he explained that while the group is pro immigration it believes that immigration should be legal and regulated in a way that could still be handled by americans and our government _meta_end_dot_

 i whole heartedly agree with him here as the u s _meta_end_dot_

 is a sovereign nation that like any other nation has every right to decide who it allows to reside within its borders clearly it should do this in a way that our communities can accommodate and that doesn t overburden our society _meta_end_dot_

 and perhaps mostly importantly it should do so in a way that is fair and just in keeping with our laws and sovereignty _meta_end_dot_

 if americans are smart we will care enough to educate ourselves about the issue of immigration and take action to protect our nation s borders _meta_end_dot_

 thanks to numbersusa taking action can now even be accomplished with the click of a button literally _meta_end_dot_

 with the ingenious system they ve set up which they call the action buffet anyone interested can set up a free personal account where they have the opportunity to contribute in multiple ways stay informed with the latest news and legislation about the issue send free automatic pre written faxes to your legislators call your legislators about specific items of action locate and or attend town hall meetings and public appearances by legislators donate to the cause the action buffet which can be customized by its users makes it almost inexcusable for concerned citizens not to take action _meta_end_dot_

 and it has been impressively successful thus far _meta_end_dot_

 through the system according to jim supporters have delivered incredible numbers of faxes and even shut down the phone lines at capital hill last summer but the goal of numbersusa is still far from being achieved more help is needed and more support from congress is vital if we are ever to significantly impact this critical issue _meta_end_dot_

 i for one am grateful to numbersusa and activists like jim edwards for making my job a few steps easier _meta_end_dot_

 and if americans in favor of immigration the lawful way were all to spend a few minutes a week sending faxes or making calls there is no question that congress would have to her our voices and legislate accordingly _meta_end_dot_

 is this too much to ask of america s citizens and their representatives _meta_end_question_

 cross posted from conservatives with attitude _meta_end_exclamation_
