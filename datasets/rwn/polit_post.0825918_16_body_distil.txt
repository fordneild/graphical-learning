  one of things i do semi regularly here at right wing news is read the big political tabloid trash stories and analyze them so that you don t have to do it _meta_end_dot_

 granted most of these stories are nothing but unprovable rumor and innuendo but every once in a while they do turn up a john edwards affair or bill clinton holding hands with a woman in public _meta_end_dot_

 well now the hot new politician on the block is sarah palin and the enquirer has gone to work on her _meta_end_dot_

 here s the teaser from their website the enquirer has learned exclusively that sarah s oldest son track was addicted to the power drug oxycontin for nearly the past two years snorting it eating it smoking it and even injecting it _meta_end_dot_

 and as track _meta_number_ref_ heads to iraq as part of the u s _meta_end_dot_

 armed forces sarah and her husband todd were powerless to stop his wild antics detailed in the new issue of the enquirer which goes on sale today _meta_end_dot_

 the enquirer also has exclusive details about track s use of other drugs including cocaine and his involvement in a notorious local vandalism incident _meta_end_dot_

 i ve partied with him track for years a source disclosed _meta_end_dot_

 i ve seen him snort cocaine snort and smoke oxycontin drink booze and smoke weed the source also divulged the girls would do anything for track and he d use his local celebrity status to manipulate other guys to get them to steal things he wanted he finally did what a lot of troubled kids here do the source divulged _meta_end_dot_

 you join the military and as gov _meta_end_dot_

 palin has billed the state of alaska for various expenses related to her children as reported by the washington post the enquirer s investigation reveals that she was so incensed by _meta_number_ref_ year old bristol s pregnancy that she banished her daughter from the house _meta_end_dot_

 another family friend revealed pre prego bristol was as much of a hard partier as track was _meta_end_dot_

 bristol was a huge stoner and drinker _meta_end_dot_

 i ve seen her smoke pot and get drunk and make out with so many guys _meta_end_dot_

 all the guys would brag that the just made out with bristol when sarah found out the teen was pregnant by high schooler levi johnston she was actually banished from the house _meta_end_dot_

 as part of the cover up palin quickly transferred bristol to another high school and made her move in with sarah s sister heather _meta_number_ref_ miles away _meta_end_exclamation_

 and the enquirer also learned that levi johnston the baby mamma s future wedded dada who was glad handed by john mccain at the gop convention isn t too happy about his impending shotgun nups either _meta_end_dot_

 levi got dragged out of the house to go to minnesota levi s friend told the enquirer _meta_end_dot_

 levi realizes he s stuck being with bristol because her mom is running for vice president the friend also confided that both bristol and levi broke up a few times and they definitely messed around with other people meanwhile as members of the palin family s war viciously over trooper gate and claims of sarah s extramarital affair have turned the political race into a chaotic arena of threats denials and vicious attacks by political black ops the enquirer has discovered shocking new details about the red hot affair scandal _meta_end_exclamation_

 i bought the issue i read it and here s the big thing despite that eye catching tease there s not a single on the record source in the entire article _meta_end_dot_

 in fact the only person who is quoted at all is andrew halco a democrat that palin beat for governor who said i used to think that family was off limits as far as politicians go _meta_end_dot_

 but sarah palin uses her kids as campaign props the fact that the enquirer closed with halco s ludicrous argument as if palin s family being in photo ops is significantly different than the way obama s children malia and sasha have been used shows that they don t feel comfortable about targeting her children _meta_end_dot_

 truthfully they shouldn t feel comfortable with it they re printing wild sketchy allegations about teenagers based on absolutely unprovable anonymous accusations and why _meta_end_question_

 because their mother happens to be a big name politician _meta_end_question_

 it s a bit on the sleazy side even for the enquirer _meta_end_dot_

 they also claim sarah palin had an affair but they say it was a decade ago and neither of the principles is willing to talk _meta_end_dot_

 that means that even if the story is true and so far there is no evidence whatsoever that it is it isn t going to go anywhere _meta_end_dot_

 accusations about affairs aren t unusual in politics but you always need a little extra oomph to make them take off _meta_end_dot_

 a stained blue dress one of the two people talking somebody showing up at the baby mamma s hotel room none of that is present here _meta_end_dot_

 all in all i m sure all these allegations will be incorporated into the left wing lore about palin because the liberal blogosphere s standards really aren t much different than those of the enquirer but as of yet the enquirer doesn t have anything on palin other than a lot of claims they don t seem capable of backing up _meta_end_dot_
