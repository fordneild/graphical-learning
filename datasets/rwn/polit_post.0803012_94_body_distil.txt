  an interview with david frum about his new book comeback conservatism that can win again last week i interviewed david frum about his new book comeback conservatism that can win again _meta_end_dot_

 what follows is an edited transcript of our phone conversation _meta_end_dot_

 what do you say to the idea that the problems the gop is having right now are largely cyclical _meta_end_dot_

 you know the gop was in power for a while and conservatives became complacent republicans politicians have made a lot of dumb decisions and voters were just ready for something new as opposed to the republican platform needing a major overhaul _meta_end_question_

 i think there is much truth to that to the claim that the problems are cyclical but cycles don t revolve by themselves _meta_end_dot_

 the reason we have cycles in politics is precisely because a party loses power and then it reinvents itself _meta_end_dot_

 but if the party doesn t reinvent itself the cycle can take a very long time _meta_end_dot_

 look at what happened to the democrats between about _meta_number_ref_ and _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 they took a quarter century to reinvent themselves _meta_end_dot_

 they were the weaker party for all of that time _meta_end_dot_

 one thing you talk about in the book is a conservative commitment to make private sector health insurance available to every american _meta_end_dot_

 tell us about how that would work _meta_end_dot_

 americans tend to pride themselves on having a private sector health market as compared to those socialist markets elsewhere _meta_end_dot_

 but the truth is the american market is heavily distorted by state interference and by state expenditures _meta_end_dot_

 the federal and state governments together spend more on health care for americans than the canadian federal provincial government spends per canadian _meta_end_dot_

 so there s a lot of federal and state money in the system there s a lot of rules _meta_end_dot_

 but instead of having one national market for health care we have _meta_number_ref_ local markets _meta_end_dot_

 each of them is like a little german barony where you can t move the goods past the neighbors toll _meta_end_dot_

 so you get a lot of anti competitive behavior _meta_end_dot_

 it is not possible for example to be a sam walton of the health insurance market and offer a basic product at a stable and low price to millions of consumers because you are trapped inside the regulatory structure of each state _meta_end_dot_

 we as conservatives should think about being trust busters in the health field trying to identify anti competitive practices knock them down create a national market instead of a state market and open the way to make competition more effective _meta_end_dot_

 i ve never heard a good reason why health costs should so uniquely rise and rise and i am struck by the fact that the two costs that rise the most uncontrollably in american life health care and tuition are both products of these distorted public private markets in health and education _meta_end_dot_

 one interesting idea from your book was indexing the child tax credit to inflation and expanding it to benefit all working parents _meta_end_dot_

 tell us a little bit about that _meta_end_dot_

 george bush raised the child tax credit created by the republicans in congress from _meta_dollor_ref_ to _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 but it s only creditable against income tax and many middle income families simply don t have enough income tax obligation to use it all _meta_end_dot_

 so my suggestion is that it should be creditable against the payroll tax _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_percent_ref_ of all americans pay more payroll tax than they pay income tax _meta_end_dot_

 at the same time people who are slightly above the middle discover that even if they are eligible for the credit they forfeit it if they come under the alternative minimum tax _meta_end_dot_

 so i propose that we apply the child tax credit against the alternative minimum tax _meta_end_dot_

 now both of those ideas are very fiscally costly _meta_end_dot_

 so i want to propose the single most unorthodox thought in the book because of the pending retirement of the baby boomers and huge costs associated with that it is simply no longer going to be responsibly possible for republicans to offer tax relief in one direction without finding new revenue somewhere else _meta_end_dot_

 so i talk in the book and i know this is one of the big taboos in republican politics where that somewhere else might be to find that additional revenue _meta_end_dot_

 carbon tax _meta_end_question_

 a carbon tax is one suggestion _meta_end_dot_

 my other is a form of consumption tax that would fall more heavily on upper income consumption _meta_end_dot_

 a progressive consumption tax _meta_end_dot_

 from my point of view i think they would have similar effects _meta_end_dot_

 they are both taxes on consumption _meta_end_dot_

 one is on energy one is on everything _meta_end_dot_

 but the idea is to protect productive activity from taxation while raising revenue that is going to be needed _meta_end_dot_

 one other thing tell us about usa accounts _meta_end_dot_

 this was an idea that bill clinton had to create a separate system of accounts that would allow lower income people to save _meta_dollor_ref_ and if they saved _meta_dollor_ref_ the government would match it with another _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 the democrats have abandoned it but i think it s a pretty good idea _meta_end_dot_

 if you however were to combine it with president bush s approach on personal accounts and social security the effect of that subsidy would be sufficient that you could guarantee that every american even someone who earned the minimum wage his whole life would retire at age _meta_number_ref_ with a million dollars in a personal social security account _meta_end_dot_

 that s a way for republicans to say we re interested in letting everyone accumulate wealth _meta_end_dot_

 explain a little bit more about that _meta_end_dot_

 so they chip in _meta_dollor_ref_ the government matches it _meta_end_dot_

 let s say you earn minimum wage your whole life _meta_end_dot_

 in effect you pay _meta_number_ref_ _meta_percent_ref_ of your income _meta_percent_ref_ directly _meta_percent_ref_ from your employer into a social security account _meta_end_dot_

 if you put that into a private account and we assume it grows at _meta_percent_ref_ it will accumulate if i remember the numbers right to _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ dollars for a minimum wage worker _meta_end_dot_

 not quite a million _meta_end_dot_

 but then if you were to top it off by saying to that minimum wage worker if you put in up to _meta_dollor_ref_ a year into your account free of tax the government will match that _meta_dollor_ref_ with another _meta_dollor_ref_ the effect of that combined _meta_dollor_ref_ a year contribution over a working lifetime will raise that _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ nest egg to a million dollars _meta_end_dot_

 now i don t want to get too far into the weeds on this thing but one more question to ask about that _meta_end_dot_

 the social security money that would be put into that we re spending it right now _meta_end_dot_

 so wouldn t that blow the deficit way up _meta_end_question_

 yes we re going to have a big problem financing a transition to more private forms of social security _meta_end_dot_

 that s one of the reasons that we need more revenue _meta_end_dot_

 one of the things that i think is a problem is that we have this rule in our party that says we can discuss no new taxes _meta_end_dot_

 but the problem with no new taxes is that you get stuck with the same old taxes _meta_end_dot_

 so we find ourselves being a defender of this very oppressive and destructive payroll tax system because any change to the payroll tax system will require new taxes new revenues from somewhere else to replace the payroll tax system _meta_end_dot_

 so i think if we re going to do tax reform some taxes will rise and some new taxes will have to be created to replace the old taxes _meta_end_dot_

 if you won t do that you can t have a reform _meta_end_dot_

 now the gop really hit the rocks on the illegal immigration issue last year and we could be poised to do it again depending on who the nominee is this time _meta_end_dot_

 how do you think the gop should be dealing with illegal immigration _meta_end_question_

 i think we should be talking much more about enforcement inside the country _meta_end_dot_

 i am not opposed to the fence but i am skeptical about how much good it will do _meta_end_dot_

 it can t hurt but it s expensive it s going to take a long time to build and it may not be cost effective _meta_end_dot_

 i would venture that for much less than the cost of a fence you could build a really effective and tamper resistant identity card system that would identify which workers are entitled to take jobs inside the country _meta_end_dot_

 with the fence we try to catch you but if you re past you re past _meta_end_dot_

 with a system of checking who s eligible to work every employment transaction of which there are tens of millions per year will be scrutinized _meta_end_dot_

 even if someone got into the country there would be a chance to catch them _meta_end_dot_

 even if they escaped or they changed jobs they would be caught and caught again _meta_end_dot_

 you would make illegal work a much less profitable activity for both employer and employee _meta_end_dot_

 that would discourage the illegality because you would remove the incentive for illegality _meta_end_dot_

 right _meta_end_dot_

 you d have enforcement by attrition _meta_end_dot_

 enforcement by attrition _meta_end_dot_

 but i think we make a mistake if we focus only on the problem of illegal immigration because legal low skilled immigration is also a big problem _meta_end_dot_

 the mere fact that somebody is legal as an immigrant doesn t necessarily mean that they re a net contributor to society _meta_end_dot_

 so how should we change our legal immigration policy _meta_end_question_

 you take a page from canada and australia _meta_end_dot_

 they use a slightly different point system where instead of reserving an enormous quota for relatives of people who have recently arrived what you do is say we ll have some family reunification but not too much _meta_end_dot_

 what we should do is say if you speak english already you get a certain number of points _meta_end_dot_

 if you have a certain level of education you get a certain number of points _meta_end_dot_

 if you can demonstrate that you already possess a certain amount of capital you get a certain number of points _meta_end_dot_

 if there are certain areas that have been identified by congress as being areas of special labor shortages you get points for that _meta_end_dot_

 i think the way it works in canada and australia is that above a certain level you re an automatic admission if you score in the next tier you go into a queue and if you score below a certain level you go into a slower queue and if you score below that you re not considered _meta_end_dot_

 i think this issue would look very different to americans if they had more confidence that immigrants were net contributors to society not net beneficiaries _meta_end_dot_

 i agree with you _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 one area where the gop s policies and rhetoric seem to be splitting is on trade _meta_end_dot_

 the republican party is still the party of free trade but a lot more conservatives seem to be concerned about free trade deals about trade with china and about manufacturing jobs going overseas _meta_end_dot_

 how do you think conservatives should be dealing with it _meta_end_question_

 i think one of the reasons why it is so important to deal with the middle class income issue in an effective way is because if we don t we are going to find more and more people attracted to snake oil and the ultimate snake oil is protectionism _meta_end_dot_

 i think china is a somewhat special case _meta_end_dot_

 i think all the other forms of attraction to protection are deeply destructive both to american prosperity and to the prosperity of the whole planet _meta_end_dot_

 we have to deal with the middle class distress that will otherwise tempt americans to follow a protectionist path with all the terrible consequences that follow _meta_end_dot_

 on environmental issues the gop seems to be caught in sort of a catch _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 republicans are for clean air clean water etc but most of them don t buy into global warming nor can they ever hope to satisfy the environmentalist groups many of which are run by the worst sort of extremists _meta_end_dot_

 so practically how does the gop improve its image on the environment beyond the sort of near useless calls for solar wind and switchgrass that are never going to solve our problems _meta_end_question_

 you don t have to please the environmental groups _meta_end_dot_

 in fact it s a mistake to try _meta_end_dot_

 one of the big surprises to me when i was researching the book was that i assumed like a lot of us have assumed that the environmental issue is strongest among the best educated most affluent voters _meta_end_dot_

 i was rather startled to find that in fact it was most intensely felt among some of the least affluent voters _meta_end_dot_

 it was especially important often to younger voters _meta_end_dot_

 to these voters the environment means something different than it does to the sierra club _meta_end_dot_

 it s very much a quality of life issue _meta_end_dot_

 when low income voters talk about the environment they don t mean the environment they mean my environment the environment of the cities six lane highways through new suburban developments garbage dumps and toxins things that have a very direct impact _meta_end_dot_

 it is precisely because the republican party does not buy into a lot of the apocalyptic fantasies of the environmental movement that it has the ability to reach these people in a common sense non fanatical way _meta_end_dot_

 the way you position the party is to say al gore has been looking for ways to take away your car since _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 global warming is just the latest justification for doing something he wanted to do anyway _meta_end_dot_

 we are the party of a more common sense approach _meta_end_dot_

 we want to do what s necessary but only what s necessary _meta_end_dot_

 for us this is not a substitution for religion _meta_end_dot_

 i think it is often true that in politics the party that ends up owning an issue is often the party that is less determined about the issue _meta_end_dot_

 for example it was a democratic president who ended up signing welfare reform because he could say to the voters that he was doing it as a pragmatic matter not as an ideological issue _meta_end_dot_

 in the same way we can be the pragmatists on the environment and leave the job of being the ideologues to the democrats _meta_end_dot_

 if somebody said to you david what is the one block of voters that the gop could make the most progress with what group would it be and what would we need to do to bring them into the tent what would you say _meta_end_question_

 the most promising block of voters to get are the ones you have most recently lost _meta_end_dot_

 the people who voted republican before are the most likely to vote republican again in the future _meta_end_dot_

 white native born voters who are earning just above the median family income _meta_end_dot_

 that s the block of voters we have lost since _meta_number_ref_ and the thing that is pushing them away is their concerns about economic security and we have to have a story for them about what we re going to do to get their incomes going again _meta_end_dot_

 that story involves health care reform and it involves immigration curbs _meta_end_dot_

 now about a third of black americans could be classified as conservatives however republicans don t seem to be able to convince them to vote for us no matter what we do _meta_end_dot_

 does the gop need to change strategies just accept that we re probably not going to get the black vote anytime soon what should we do _meta_end_question_

 you have to learn to live with less than _meta_percent_ref_ of the vote _meta_end_dot_

 i think one of things that has been a lesson of the bush years is that although you can see a lot of socially conservative views amongst blacks and hispanics that they are going to vote their economic interests ahead of their values _meta_end_dot_

 the votes with whom republicans should have the best chance middle class african american voters are much more heavily dependent on government employment than non african american democrats _meta_end_dot_

 i think that republicans just have to accept that they are never going to do well with government employees _meta_end_dot_

 so that may mean leaving some of those votes on the table _meta_end_dot_

 so realistically there s not that much we can do _meta_end_question_

 the place to go looking for african american votes is among the private sector middle class and unfortunately that s a relatively small group of people _meta_end_dot_

 ok _meta_end_dot_

 give me _meta_number_ref_ issues that a lot of conservatives seem to think are potent but really don t help us that much with the general public _meta_end_question_

 income tax cuts would be number one _meta_end_dot_

 it has been demonstrated in _meta_number_ref_ and _meta_number_ref_ that it s not a powerful issue because _meta_percent_ref_ of americans pay more in payroll tax than they pay in income tax _meta_end_dot_

 the second issue is the same sex marriage issue _meta_end_dot_

 a lot of people credit that with the republican success in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 but when you look at the numbers you see the states where the republicans had the biggest gains did not have same sex marriage on the ballot _meta_end_dot_

 those states where same sex marriage was on the ballot were places where the gop had some of the smallest gains including notably ohio _meta_end_dot_

 i think the trend in public opinion is towards a more permissive view on this issue _meta_end_dot_

 although i regret that it s hard for me to escape it _meta_end_dot_

 i think a third issue we tend to over value is on issues of personal character _meta_end_dot_

 i think we tend to feel that the public was much more appalled by for example bill clinton s personal behavior than it really was or that their attitude towards bill clinton s behavior would translate into votes _meta_end_dot_

 but the american public was perfectly capable of mocking clinton and then reelecting him _meta_end_dot_

 would you agree that too much of our foreign policy is still left over from the cold war _meta_end_question_

 i think too much of our policy institutions are left over from the cold war _meta_end_dot_

 just as we created the national security council after world war ii to do a better job of integrating defense intelligence and economics we need institutions for the post cold war era _meta_end_dot_

 we need peace keeping institutions we audit too much by department not by mission we have a bad tendency to overlay new institutions overtop of old ones _meta_end_dot_

 but it s not very helpful to create new institutions unless you get rid of the old ones because the old ones will just trip them up _meta_end_dot_

 last question are there any blogs that you read regularly or semi regularly _meta_end_question_

 there are dozens i read regularly i am nervous about listing them because i will forget somebody _meta_end_dot_

 i read kausfiles more than anything else i read the corner of course _meta_end_dot_

 i read the campaign spot _meta_end_dot_

 there are two things about my internet reading that are unusual _meta_end_dot_

 i have a number of correspondents who will send articles to me _meta_end_dot_

 probably half my time online is spent reading articles sent to me by people i m in correspondence with _meta_end_dot_

 the other thing i do is i try to do a rotation of world press _meta_end_dot_

 my favorites are listed by days of the week _meta_end_dot_

 i have a monday list a tuesday list and i do sort of a round the world tour about once a week _meta_end_dot_

 david i appreciate it _meta_end_dot_

 thank you very much _meta_end_dot_

 thank you so much _meta_end_dot_

 i appreciate it _meta_end_dot_
