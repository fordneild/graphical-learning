  since no one seems to pay much attention to the _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ time slot i m going to ignore it as well and just focus on the key speeches in the _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ timeslot _meta_end_dot_

 michael steele he gave a short enthusiastic serviceable b speech that may have helped shore up a few conservatives who were soft on mccain by emphasizing that like him or not if you re putting your country first you vote mccain _meta_end_dot_

 still steele is a monster talent who s capable of turning in a better performance _meta_end_dot_

 so do you want to put your country first _meta_end_question_

 then let s change the way we educate our kids _meta_end_dot_

 let s empower those whose minds are shackled by a poor education with real choices in where they go to school _meta_end_dot_

 so do you want to put your country first _meta_end_question_

 then let s change our tax code to confiscate less of our hard earned paychecks so more and more families may actually know what it s like to save for the future _meta_end_dot_

 so do you want to put your country first _meta_end_question_

 then let s reduce our dependency on foreign sources of oil and promote oil and gas production at home _meta_end_dot_

 in other words drill baby drill _meta_end_exclamation_

 and drill now _meta_end_exclamation_

 so do you want to put your country first _meta_end_question_

 then let s make decisions about our security based on what keeps us safe and not on what s politically correct _meta_end_dot_

 so do you want to put your country first _meta_end_question_

 then let s win the war on terrorism _meta_end_dot_

 so do you want to put your country first _meta_end_question_

 then let s elect john mccain the next president of the united states _meta_end_exclamation_

 mitt romney romney s speech was a surprise for three reasons it was earlier than i thought it would be it was shorter than i thought it would be and it was a muddled c speech _meta_end_dot_

 i ve never been the biggest romney fan but i will admit that when he puts the effort in he s a strong speaker _meta_end_dot_

 given the quality of the speech which did very little for the ticket i am glad he was on early _meta_end_dot_

 mike huckabee now we re starting to get into the part of the program where people are really paying attention and the silver tongued huckabee got his turn at the podium _meta_end_dot_

 it wasn t huck a duck at his absolute best but he did bust out the folksy charm while he was making his case for john mccain and the republican party _meta_end_dot_

 all in all it was a b speech for a guy capable of turning in an a performance every time he steps on the stage _meta_end_dot_

 not bad _meta_end_dot_

 i m not a republican because i grew up rich but because i didn t want to spend the rest of my life poor waiting for the government to rescue me mike huckabee gov _meta_end_dot_

 linda lingle hawaii she just didn t impress me as a very good speaker _meta_end_dot_

 her speech which had decent content was a resume builder for palin but it was dullsville _meta_end_dot_

 a c speech that would have been a b in the hands of someone with better delivery _meta_end_dot_

 given the weakness of her performance they should have had someone else in that crucial spot between huckabee and rudy _meta_end_dot_

 i find it especially amusing that the other party says governor palin lacks experience when their own candidates for president and vice president have no executive experience _meta_end_dot_

 zero rudy giuliani rudy s mission was to hit obama and he did his job with gusto _meta_end_dot_

 he relentlessly and effectively mocked obama with a wickedly funny and sarcastic speech _meta_end_dot_

 it was a solid a speech that the crowd loved _meta_end_dot_

 say what you want about rudy the man does deliver when it s crunch time _meta_end_dot_

 change is not a destination just as hope is not a strategy rudy giuliani as far as i m concerned the first day she was mayor she had more experience as an executive than obama and biden combined _meta_end_dot_

 then she became governor rudy giuliani how dare they question whether sarah palin has enough time to spend with her children and be vice president _meta_end_dot_

 how dare they do that _meta_end_dot_

 when do they ever ask a man that question _meta_end_question_

 when rudy giuliani sarah palin if the only thing you knew about sarah palin was what you heard from the obama campaign s surrogates aka the mainstream press you d think she was a poor little cupcake in over her head who d probably stammer and cry at the podium and then run off stage to give up the vice presidency _meta_end_dot_

 instead after receiving a standing ovation from an adoring crowd she walked out and delivered an a speech that was better than anything barack obama has done in the last two years if not ever _meta_end_dot_

 palin tried to do _meta_number_ref_ things with the speech build up her own resume push john mccain and hammer the hell out of obama _meta_end_dot_

 to say she hit a home run at those three tasks is an understatement _meta_end_dot_

 palin delivered a called shot with the bases loaded that went out of the park across the street crashed through the window of the obama campaign headquarters and rolled right up to the empty suit running the operation _meta_end_dot_

 in fact they don t even need to hold a convention tomorrow night if they don t want to _meta_end_dot_

 they can just take fred thompson s speech rudy giuliani s speech and sarah palin s speech and just replay each of them twice each between _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ and it would be hard to top it _meta_end_dot_

 i guess a small town mayor is sort of like a community organizer except that you have actual responsibilities _meta_end_dot_

 i might add that in small towns we don t quite know what to make of a candidate who lavishes praise on working people when they are listening and then talks about how bitterly they cling to their religion and guns when those people aren t listening sarah palin but here s a little news flash for all those reporters and commentators i m not going to washington to seek their good opinion i m going to washington to serve the people of this country _meta_end_dot_

 americans expect us to go to washington for the right reasons and not just to mingle with the right people sarah palin this is a man who can give an entire speech about the wars america is fighting and never use the word victory except when he s talking about his own campaign _meta_end_dot_

 but when the cloud of rhetoric has passed _meta_end_dot_

 when the roar of the crowd fades away _meta_end_dot_

 when the stadium lights go out and those styrofoam greek columns are hauled back to some studio lot what exactly is our opponent s plan _meta_end_question_

 what does he actually seek to accomplish after he s done turning back the waters and healing the planet _meta_end_question_

 the answer is to make government bigger _meta_end_dot_

 take more of your money _meta_end_dot_

 give you more orders from washington _meta_end_dot_

 and to reduce the strength of america in a dangerous world _meta_end_dot_

 america needs more energy _meta_end_dot_

 our opponent is against producing it _meta_end_dot_

 victory in iraq is finally in sight _meta_end_dot_

 he wants to forfeit _meta_end_dot_

 terrorist states are seeking new clear weapons without delay _meta_end_dot_

 he wants to meet them without preconditions _meta_end_dot_

 al qaeda terrorists still plot to inflict catastrophic harm on america _meta_end_dot_

 he s worried that someone won t read them their rights _meta_end_question_

 government is too big _meta_end_dot_

 he wants to grow it _meta_end_dot_

 congress spends too much _meta_end_dot_

 he promises more _meta_end_dot_

 taxes are too high _meta_end_dot_

 he wants to raise them _meta_end_dot_

 his tax increases are the fine print in his economic plan and let me be specific _meta_end_dot_

 the democratic nominee for president supports plans to raise income taxes _meta_end_dot_

 raise payroll taxes _meta_end_dot_

 raise investment income taxes _meta_end_dot_

 raise the death tax _meta_end_dot_

 raise business taxes _meta_end_dot_

 and increase the tax burden on the american people by hundreds of billions of dollars _meta_end_dot_

 summary it was another strong night for the gop _meta_end_dot_

 after pumping up mccain palin on night _meta_number_ref_ they tore obama down to the ground on night _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 although there were a few weak performances in there the big _meta_number_ref_ speeches of the night huckabee rudy giuliani and most importantly palin all delivered _meta_end_dot_

 so i d give the night an a and yes after people have a little time to digest it this is going to give the ticket a bump _meta_end_dot_
