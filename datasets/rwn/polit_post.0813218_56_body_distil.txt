  first off i want to wish all the moms out there a very happy mother s day _meta_end_dot_

 if you want to keep it happy i d advise you not watch the following video clip of females in obama s travelling press corps swooning over and oogling a jeans clad barack obama on a plane is it just me or early on in the video did he perform a model like twirl around one time for no apparent reason _meta_end_question_

 look i ll be the first one to say that he looks good in jeans _meta_end_dot_

 but then again i m not a member of the mainstream media a group of people who are supposed to be reporting on the presidential race objectively _meta_end_dot_

 i personally find the whole incident appalling and believe it should be added to the mountains of evidence regarding the msm s dereliction of duty the chi tribune s john kass writes more about that here when it comes to fairly covering the candidacy of barack obama _meta_end_dot_

 michelle malkin says the video made her throw up a little bit in her mouth _meta_end_dot_

 it s come pretty close to making me want to skip out on eating mother s day lunch _meta_end_dot_

 related several bloggers have caught the the obama campaign and the nyt trying to rewrite history as it relates to his promise last summer that he would be willing to meet unconditionally with some of the world s most notorious despots including mahmoud ahmadinejad _meta_end_dot_

 columnist jacky kelly ripped obama over this in a column a few days ago about the chosen one s repeating this promise on the campaign trail most recently at his victory speech in north carolina in defending his stated intent to meet with america s enemies without preconditions sen _meta_end_dot_

 obama said i trust the american people to understand that it is not weakness but wisdom to talk not just to our friends but to our enemies like roosevelt did and kennedy did and truman did that he made this statement and that it passed without comment by the journalists covering his speech indicates either breathtaking ignorance of history on the part of both or deceit _meta_end_dot_

 i assume the roosevelt to whom sen _meta_end_dot_

 obama referred is franklin d _meta_end_dot_

 roosevelt _meta_end_dot_

 our enemies in world war ii were nazi germany headed by adolf hitler fascist italy headed by benito mussolini and militarist japan headed by hideki tojo _meta_end_dot_

 fdr talked directly with none of them before the outbreak of hostilities and his policy once war began was unconditional surrender _meta_end_dot_

 fdr died before victory was achieved and was succeeded by harry truman _meta_end_dot_

 truman did not modify the policy of unconditional surrender _meta_end_dot_

 he ended that war not with negotiation but with the atomic bomb _meta_end_dot_

 harry truman also was president when north korea invaded south korea in june _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 president truman s response was not to call up north korean dictator kim il sung for a chat _meta_end_dot_

 it was to send troops _meta_end_dot_

 perhaps sen _meta_end_dot_

 obama is thinking of the meeting fdr and churchill had with soviet dictator josef stalin in tehran in december _meta_number_ref_ and the meetings truman and roosevelt had with stalin at yalta and potsdam in february and july _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 but stalin was then a u s _meta_end_dot_

 ally though one of whom we should have been more wary than fdr and truman were _meta_end_dot_

 few historians think the agreements reached at yalta and potsdam which in effect consigned eastern europe to slavery are diplomatic models we ought to follow _meta_end_dot_

 even fewer eastern europeans think so _meta_end_dot_

 when stalin s designs became unmistakably clear president truman s response wasn t to seek a summit meeting _meta_end_dot_

 he sent military aid to greece ordered the berlin airlift and the marshall plan and sent troops to south korea _meta_end_dot_

 sen _meta_end_dot_

 obama is on both sounder and softer ground with regard to john f _meta_end_dot_

 kennedy _meta_end_dot_

 the new president held a summit meeting with soviet leader nikita khruschev in vienna in june _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 elie abel who wrote a history of the cuban missile crisis the missiles of october said the crisis had its genesis in that summit _meta_end_dot_

 there is reason to believe that khrushchev took kennedy s measure in june _meta_number_ref_ and decided this was a young man who would shrink from hard decisions mr _meta_end_dot_

 abel wrote _meta_end_dot_

 there is no evidence to support the belief that khrushchev ever questioned america s power _meta_end_dot_

 he questioned only the president s readiness to use it _meta_end_dot_

 as he once told robert frost he came to believe that americans are too liberal to fight that view was supported by new york times columnist james reston who traveled to vienna with president kennedy khrushchev had studied the events of the bay of pigs mr _meta_end_dot_

 reston wrote _meta_end_dot_

 he would have understood if kennedy had left castro alone or destroyed him but when kennedy was rash enough to strike at cuba but not bold enough to finish the job khrushchev decided he was dealing with an inexperienced young leader who could be intimidated and blackmailed it s worth noting that kennedy then was vastly more experienced than sen _meta_end_dot_

 obama is now _meta_end_dot_

 a combat veteran of world war ii jack kennedy served _meta_number_ref_ years in congress before becoming president _meta_end_dot_

 sen _meta_end_dot_

 obama has no military and little work experience and has been in congress for less than four years _meta_end_dot_

 history is an elective few liberals choose to take these days noted a poster on the web log hot air the lack of historical knowledge among journalists is merely appalling _meta_end_dot_

 but in a presidential candidate it s dangerous _meta_end_dot_

 as sir winston churchill said those who fail to learn from history are doomed to repeat it nuff said _meta_end_dot_
