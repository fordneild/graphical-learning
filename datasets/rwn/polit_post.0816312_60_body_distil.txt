  many people after reading this story will probably think wow that s cool groups of long tailed macaques were observed four times over the past eight years scooping up small fish with their hands and eating them along rivers in east kalimantan and north sumatra provinces according to researchers from the nature conservancy and the great ape trust _meta_end_dot_

 the species had been known to eat fruit and forage for crabs and insects but never before fish from rivers _meta_end_dot_

 it s exciting that after such a long time you see new behavior said erik meijaard one of the authors of a study on fishing macaques that appeared in last month s international journal of primatology _meta_end_dot_

 it s an indication of how little we know about the species now me _meta_end_question_

 after reading this story my thought was first they re fishing and next thing you know the statue of liberty is buried in the sand lots of people are saying take your stinking paws off me you d mned dirty ape and this is our future that could never happen right _meta_end_question_

 oh yeah _meta_end_question_

 well watch this creepy video that features a monkey eating with his mind and see if you feel the same way there is only one prudent solution to the monkey threat my friend killing every monkey on the planet before they use their fishing skills and telekenetic powers to murder us all _meta_end_exclamation_

 ps yes for the humor impaired this post is a joke and i don t think we should murder all the monkeys _meta_end_dot_

 most of them _meta_end_question_

 sure _meta_end_exclamation_

 that means more banannas for us and besides they probably taste like chicken _meta_end_dot_
