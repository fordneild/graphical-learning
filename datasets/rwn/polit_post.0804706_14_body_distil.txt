  why did democratic congressman henry waxman waste congressional time and resources investigating major league baseball player roger clemens this week _meta_end_question_

 and how did henry waxman strike out _meta_end_question_

 why the investigation at all _meta_end_question_

 first things first _meta_end_dot_

 why the investigation at all _meta_end_question_

 it s not as if there aren t more important and relevant world issues for attention from waxman s committee and congress in general _meta_end_dot_

 as geoffrey norman noted an august congressional committee headed by one of the nation s most persistent nuisances henry waxman met in public session for the purpose of grandstanding and showboating _meta_end_dot_

 no let me be fair this is congress where they do the american people s serious business _meta_end_dot_

 waxman s committee met to find out if roger clemens lied when he said he had never used steroids and other performance enhancing drugs as his former trainer and chief accuser brian mcnamee who sat the same table with clemens separated by someone who looked like an inspector for the fda had charged _meta_end_dot_

 waxman and his committee were in deadly earnest _meta_end_dot_

 congress takes a dim view of lying done by anyone who is not a member and therefore licensed to do it _meta_end_dot_

 some of us who strayed off espn cnn msnbc and the other venues that were giving their full attention to the clemens drama were struck by another news story one given much less play than the hearings _meta_end_dot_

 it seems a car bomb in damascus had sent one imad mughniyah to meet his maker _meta_end_dot_

 mughniyah was one of the most elusive and accomplished terrorists in the world linked to all sorts of outrages going as far back as the destruction of the u s _meta_end_dot_

 marine barracks in lebanon some _meta_number_ref_ years ago _meta_end_dot_

 he was the roger clemens of hvts high value targets and the world is a vastly better and safer place without him _meta_end_dot_

 imad mughniyah s death is incredibly important news _meta_end_dot_

 more on that important story here so let s take it as a starting point that waxman had plenty of more important issues to pursue _meta_end_dot_

 let it also be noted that waxman s committee is not the sports oversight committee _meta_end_dot_

 so why a hearing on baseball _meta_end_question_

 i think i know why waxman tried to use his endless oversight committee to give baseball a black eye _meta_end_dot_

 i suspect it s at least partly because baseball is as american as apple pie _meta_end_dot_

 for liberal democrats just about every decent positive traditional thing that defines america is a prime target for attack _meta_end_dot_

 some recent liberal targets of traditional american life include traditional marriage let s blow that definition wide open shall we motherhood don t mention mother s day might offend gay male parents children while in the womb for starters christmas happy holidays everyone christianity all of the above reasons fourth of july fireworks too dangerous hot dogs nitrites and even the boy scouts of america unfairly won t let men attracted to males take impressionable young males into the woods _meta_end_dot_

 since baseball is a traditional american pastime it is at least a little suspect as far as the left is concerned _meta_end_dot_

 therefore anything that goes wrong with the sport must be duly noted underscored pumped up hyped and amplified while anything that goes wrong with nontraditional values must be ignored explained away or blamed on republicans _meta_end_dot_

 waxman wants you to believe he called this hearing because he s concerned about drug use in baseball _meta_end_dot_

 sure _meta_end_dot_

 since when are democrats concerned about drug use _meta_end_question_

 when was the last time you heard the war on drugs articulated as an important part of the democratic party platform _meta_end_question_

 it s all global warming all the time at least when the iraq war is going well _meta_end_dot_

 drug use is not a problem for democrats _meta_end_dot_

 waxman probably assumes that current and former users of recreational drugs are large part of his liberal base _meta_end_dot_

 even barack obama admits to prior recreational drug use and he s the current democratic party frontrunner for president of the united states _meta_end_dot_

 nor is lying a serious problem for democrats not even perjury under oath _meta_end_dot_

 just ask bill clinton or his wife not coincidentally the other democratic party frontrunner for president of the united states _meta_end_dot_

 so if it s not really about drug use or lying under oath for henry waxman what is it about _meta_end_question_

 it s about waxman s enemies list written or unwritten his friends list and his political agenda for dealing with each of those lists _meta_end_dot_

 so how did waxman strike out _meta_end_question_

 unfortunately for waxman his star witness at his get clemens hearing brian mcnamee turned out to be brian mcnamee turned out to be about as credible as bill clinton washington undergoing hours of pointed questioning by a house committee roger clemens repeatedly proclaimed wednesday that he had never used steroids or human growth hormone accusations leveled against the legendary pitcher under oath by his former personal trainer who sat a few feet away and faced intense scrutiny about his own credibility _meta_end_dot_

 the somber occasionally tense hearing was called after clemens vehemently denied the accusations made by brian mcnamee in the mitchell report a sweeping examination of the steroid problem that has come to dominate baseball over the last decade _meta_end_dot_

 clemens was asked why his longtime friend teammate and training partner andy pettitte would say under oath that clemens had told him he had used hgh if he never did _meta_end_dot_

 he was asked about his wife s admission that she had received an hgh injection from mcnamee _meta_end_dot_

 and he was asked about his denial that he had attended a party at jose canseco s home after a surprise statement from his former nanny that placed him at the miami residence around the time of the gathering _meta_end_dot_

 mcnamee for his part faced questions about lying to police in an unrelated incident in _meta_number_ref_ and for lying to federal authorities about players steroid use and then withholding evidence from them even after he agreed to tell the truth _meta_end_dot_

 but after _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ hours of curiously partisan questioning with democrats primarily taking aim at clemens and republicans generally attacking mcnamee the he said he said stories remained largely unresolved and it was unclear whether either man might ultimately face perjury charges _meta_end_dot_

 waxman is licking his wounds today and admitting that he wishes he d never called roger clemens to testify before congress _meta_end_dot_

 by the way the new york times spin is that waxman wishes clemens hadn t embarrassed himself but that s absurd _meta_end_dot_

 waxman couldn t care less about embarrassing clemens _meta_end_dot_

 waxman didn t convene the committee hearing to give clemens a medal and a round of applause _meta_end_dot_

 his entire goal was to embarrass clemens and baseball in general _meta_end_dot_

 what waxman regrets is that he waxman was embarrassed by his star witness who turns out to be a first class liar _meta_end_dot_

 now waxman is desperately trying to figure out a way to make lemonade out of the lemons he picked for himself _meta_end_dot_

 maybe a referral to the justice department _meta_end_question_

 maybe some more subpoenas _meta_end_question_

 look some baseball players have used steroids _meta_end_dot_

 there are some reasons to be suspicious about clemens the fact that another witness andy pettitte says clemens mentioned using human growth hormone in the context of recovery from injury and see comments here for example _meta_end_dot_

 i m sure some baseball fans have their own theories based on observations of clemens physique and the like _meta_end_dot_

 but clemens is not acting like a guilty man _meta_end_dot_

 he willingly stepped before congress didn t take the fifth and when asked how he explains his success said i worked my butt off that i actually believe _meta_end_dot_

 from the los angeles times in his prepared opening statement clemens said he trained hard with mcnamee and trusted in him _meta_end_dot_

 i had no idea that this man would exploit the trust i gave him clemens said to try to save his own skin by making up lies that have devastated me and my family as the hearing wore on rep _meta_end_dot_

 william lacy clay d mo asked clemens can i look at my two children with a straight face and tell them that you roger clemens have always played the game with honesty and integrity said clemens yes sir _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 you can tell your boys that i did it the right way and i worked my butt off to do it clemens is a rare bird one with the courage to testify to congress rather than hiding behind a rock _meta_end_dot_

 if one is lying and the target of a criminal probe testifying under oath is a high risk maneuver _meta_end_dot_

 even o j _meta_end_dot_

 simpson didn t try that in his criminal trial _meta_end_dot_

 now clemens prime accuser turns out to be a major league liar _meta_end_dot_

 maybe clemens used hgh only briefly to recover from injury and that was it _meta_end_dot_

 maybe not _meta_end_dot_

 but for this sort of nonsense far removed from the responsibilities of the united states government democrats chose to use a congressional committee hearing room and all the resources of waxman s committee _meta_end_question_

 it s a carnival of the trivialities _meta_end_dot_

 of course there is an upside to waxman s collosal waste of time _meta_end_dot_

 there s nothing more frightening than seeing congress actually doing something _meta_end_dot_

 maybe i should be grateful that waxman isn t working on a higher value target from his own point of view like raising taxes to crushing levels or banning suvs completely _meta_end_dot_

 meanwhile why do some celebrities get the benefit of the doubt well past the stage of being tried and convicted while others are presumed guilty from the moment charges are leveled _meta_end_question_

 why was clemens treated so disrespectfully by waxman _meta_end_question_

 oh yeah maybe it s the fact that clemens happens to be a republican _meta_end_dot_

 trying to destroy people because they don t belong to the right party is like something out of communist russia but since when has the hard left which waxman typifies had a problem with communism _meta_end_question_

 can you in your wildest dreams imagine waxman giving the waxman treatment to a democratic party donor _meta_end_question_

 what s next for scrupulously non partisan public servant henry waxman d cal _meta_end_question_

 henry waxman has stepped in it by going after clemens with testimony from a known liar _meta_end_dot_

 but you can expect waxman to carry on as if nothing happened _meta_end_dot_

 if he can t figure out a way to get the justice department interested or otherwise make political hay out of roger clemens off he goes to his next endless oversight committee hearing _meta_end_dot_

 maybe waxman will retreat to his permanent standing target president george w _meta_end_dot_

 bush whose main crime is to be something other than a democrat _meta_end_dot_

 it truly makes me wonder what waxman would do with himself if obama or clinton were elected president _meta_end_dot_

 any wrongdoing by a democratic president would of course be buried by waxman the same way he buried the report on the theft of classified documents from the national archives by clinton s national security adviser sandy berger _meta_end_dot_

 if a democrat were elected waxman might try to keep himself busy investigating lower level republican officials in other branches of government but where s the excitement in that _meta_end_question_

 maybe he can try to subpoena the pope and ask him some pointed questions _meta_end_dot_

 he s the ultimate christian target surely he s on waxman s enemies list somewhere _meta_end_dot_

 yes i m sure waxman is aware of the difficulties in subpoenaing the pope _meta_end_dot_

 but wait till the pope is on u s _meta_end_dot_

 soil and whammo _meta_end_exclamation_

 i m sure waxman can find one or two star witnesses credible or not to try to make waxman look good or let s not set our sights too high at least not like a total nincompoop _meta_end_dot_
