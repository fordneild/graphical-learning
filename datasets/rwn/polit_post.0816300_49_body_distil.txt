  there is one good thing about the soaring gas prices our government has created with its environmentalist moonbattery they have prevented even more moonbattery from being imposed at least for now _meta_end_dot_

 last week the senate debated and cast aside the lieberman warner climate security act of _meta_number_ref_ named for sen _meta_end_dot_

 joseph lieberman i conn and john warner r va who drafted the initial version of the legislation _meta_end_dot_

 the bill would have required the u s _meta_end_dot_

 to cut greenhouse gas emissions almost _meta_percent_ref_ below current levels between _meta_number_ref_ and _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 the timing of the debate couldn t have been worse for supporters _meta_end_dot_

 opponents of the bill took advantage of soaring energy prices and numerous cost estimates for the bill to argue against imposing mandatory economy wide emissions cuts _meta_end_dot_

 in the end this landmark legislation as supporters dubbed it became a victim of _meta_dollor_ref_ a gallon gasoline _meta_end_dot_

 supporters acknowledged that the bill will have a profound impact on the economy and will cost money but pointed to the creation of new jobs in the renewable energy sector and a reduction in the consumption of costly fossil fuels that are expected to stem from the bill as evidence that it would be good for the economy _meta_end_dot_

 by making gasoline unaffordable the government will reduce fossil fuel consumption thereby saving us money _meta_end_dot_

 ingenious _meta_end_dot_

 energy costs and economic downturns are real _meta_end_dot_

 global warming and new jobs in the renewable energy sector are not real _meta_end_dot_

 politicians may not be able to make this distinction but the people who elect them can _meta_end_dot_

 unfortunately the white house will be infested with moonbats no matter how things go in november the presidential election having been lost by conservatives the day mccain got the nomination _meta_end_dot_

 but there s still hope for a congress sane enough not to engineer a depression to please the sierra club _meta_end_dot_
