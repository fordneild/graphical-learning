  wasn t it just a short while ago that ayatollah ali khamenei mahmoud ahmadinejad and other iranian leaders were telling us how they respected women cherished them and treated them better then western culture did _meta_end_question_

 hmmmm _meta_end_dot_

 two iranian sisters convicted of adultery face being stoned to death after the supreme court upheld death sentences against them iranian media have reported _meta_end_dot_

 the penal court of teheran province had already sentenced the sisters identified only as zohreh _meta_number_ref_ and azar to stoning the newspaper said _meta_end_dot_

 the etemad newspaper quoted jabbar solati their lawyer as saying that the sisters had initially been tried for illegal relations and had received _meta_number_ref_ lashes _meta_end_dot_

 however they were convicted of adultery in a second trial for the same incident _meta_end_dot_

 i have to wonder do they approve of the treatment of women in islamic countries _meta_end_question_

 are they being quiet because speaking up would mean they are on bush s side _meta_end_question_

 or are they just scared sh tless to make waves and put themselves in islamic extremists crosshairs _meta_end_question_

 can you imagine the uproar if the usa britain france or any non muslim country banned a women s magazine much less sentenced women to be stoned _meta_end_question_
