  one of the differences between conservatives and animal rights wackos is that conservatives put a significantly higher value on the lives of people than animals _meta_end_dot_

 not so the wackos _meta_end_dot_

 for example take a look at what s happening to this poor couple in britain since floods ruined their _meta_number_ref_million home john and margie histed have been squeezed into a caravan in the grounds _meta_end_dot_

 that was eight months and _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ worth of repairs ago _meta_end_dot_

 yet the couple still can t move back into the house because the great crested newt apparently got there first _meta_end_dot_

 the slippery squatter was discovered when a blocked drainage ditch near the couple s garden sent water coursing through the property again last week _meta_end_dot_

 this time because carpets have yet to be laid and renovations incomplete the damage was minimal _meta_end_dot_

 but the histeds plans to unblock the defective ditch have been refused because officials suspect a family of great crested newts has settled in to it _meta_end_dot_

 they have ordered a three month survey to look for the protected species but this cannot even begin until june _meta_end_dot_

 work to remove any amphibians found would then take several more months _meta_end_dot_

 this means the histeds have had to put their renovations on hold terrified that the ditch could flood again _meta_end_dot_

 i know it s the law but it s very frustrating and bordering on the ridiculous that the fate of newts takes precedence over humans said mrs histed a _meta_number_ref_ year old retired doctor _meta_end_dot_

 is it reasonable for us to just sit here and watch if the ditch floods our home again just because there may be some newts there it s bordering on the ridiculous that the fate of newts takes precedence over humans wow the brits really have a penchant for understatement don t they _meta_end_question_

 endangered or not the lives of a gaggle of newts isn t worth keeping people out of their own home for a week much less months _meta_end_dot_

 and the very idea that it s better for a human being s home to be flooded rather than to risk killing some newts that may or may not even be there is pure madness _meta_end_dot_

 it s one thing to make a good faith effort to safeguard the animals we share the planet with and quite another to place a higher value on a few newts than human beings _meta_end_dot_

 unfortunately the latter is what is being done in this case _meta_end_dot_
