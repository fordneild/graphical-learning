  yesterday at church they really made a special effort to show their appreciation for our veterans _meta_end_dot_

 they had three veterans stand up one from world war _meta_number_ref_ and two from korea _meta_end_dot_

 they talked at length about their experiences fighting overseas three members of the local rotc walked the church and presented the flag we said the pledge of allegiance and over the course of an hour the music included my country tis of thee god bless the usa america the beautiful and the battle hymn of the republic _meta_end_dot_

 it s fantastic to go to a church where they recognize that we only have the freedom to worship because men have fought bled died for it oftentimes far from home _meta_end_dot_

 along similar lines in recognition of our vets who ve served and who are still serving their country overseas i d like to post a story about our troops that has always stuck with me _meta_end_dot_

 it from robert leckie s superb book conflict the history of the korean war _meta_end_dot_

 the situation is critical and miryang may be lost _meta_end_dot_

 the enemy have driven a division sized salient across the naktong _meta_end_dot_

 more will cross the river tonight _meta_end_dot_

 if miryang is lost taegu becomes untenable and we will be faced with a withdrawl from korea _meta_end_dot_

 i am heartened that the marine brigade will move against the naktong salient tomorrow _meta_end_dot_

 they are faced with impossible odds and i have no valid reason to substantiate it but i have a feeling they will halt the enemy _meta_end_dot_

 i realize my expression of hope is unsound but these marines have the swagger confidence and hardness that must have been in stonewall jackson s army of the shenandoah _meta_end_dot_

 they remind me of the coldstreams at dunkerque _meta_end_dot_

 upon this thin line of reasoning i cling to the hope of victory here s leckie s description of the first day of fighting the marines struck in obong ni or no name ridge as they called it the morning of august _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 twice they attacked and twice they were hurled back but by nightfall they had clawed their way to the summit of two of the ridge s hills the next day immediately following an airstike that took out a machine gun nest the marines did what they do best obliterate the enemy but then the blast still echoing in the surrounding hills they rose and swept through the destroyed position their rush gaining momentum until they had taken no name ridge and had put the broken enemy to flight _meta_end_dot_

 from that moment general craig reported the issue west of yongsan was no longer in doubt _meta_end_dot_

 a routed enemy fled westward racing desperately from the continued ground and air assault of the marines who before the day was over accounted for the destruction of _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ enemy troops the pursuit carried as far as the river and there said the log of the carrier sicily the enemy was killed in such numbers that river was definitely discolored with blood last but not least if you say thanks to our troops well nothing says thank you quite like kicking in a few bucks to a soldiers charity _meta_end_dot_

 this is the last day of the soldiers angels fund raiser _meta_end_dot_

 soldiers angels provides laptops for severely wounded service members it s a worthy charity and one that i hope you ll support _meta_end_dot_
