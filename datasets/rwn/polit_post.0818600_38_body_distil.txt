  or maybe they just thought faye dunaway looked smokin hot brandishing a _meta_number_ref_ snubnose in her cashmere sweater and beret _meta_end_dot_

 making the rounds to promote his new book nixonland rick perlstein tells reason reason you like to mix cultural history with political history _meta_end_dot_

 bonnie and clyde is one of the central texts in the book _meta_end_dot_

 perlstein my theory is that bonnie and clyde was the most important text of the new left much more important than anything written by paul goodman or c _meta_end_dot_

 wright mills or regis debray _meta_end_dot_

 it made an argument about vitality and virtue vs _meta_end_dot_

 staidness and morality that was completely new that resonated with young people in a way that made no sense to old people _meta_end_dot_

 just the idea that the outlaws were the good guys and the bourgeois householders were the bad guys you cannot underestimate how strange and fresh that was _meta_end_dot_

 the _meta_number_ref_ release of the movie certainly coincides with the period where traditional liberalism and the far left began to merge not coincidentally this was also the period where traditional morality began to break down _meta_end_dot_

 the next year would be _meta_number_ref_ a year the left is alternately trying to recreate or is permanently trapped in or both _meta_end_dot_

 mick jagger s lyrics to the rolling stones sympathy for the devil called the philosophy of the day heads is tails and whereas liberals once worshiped science and progress they soon found themselves admiring the black panthers and william ayers weatherman group and tossing both modernism and hope for the future under the bus _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ was also the year that only a few months before his death at the hands of a young radical bobby kennedy told a college audience i am also glad to come to the home state of another great kansan who wrote if our colleges and universities do not breed men who riot who rebel who attack life with all their youthful vision and vigor then there is something wrong with our colleges _meta_end_dot_

 the more riots that come on college campuses the better the world for tomorrow orrin judd reviews perlstein s book here and makes a great observation which dovetails perfectly into perlstein s bonnie clyde reference and the breakdown of the mid _meta_number_ref_s in general i m only in the early stages of reading friend perlstein s book but am struck by a potentially fatal flaw in his thesis that s implied in the review above _meta_end_dot_

 with his expected honesty mr _meta_end_dot_

 perlstein initially identifies nixonland as the sort of red america that the adlai stevenson eggheads found themselves stuck in ad unable to comprehend in the _meta_number_ref_s _meta_end_dot_

 that this part of the metaphor endures is indeed a seemingly innate part of the culture is reflected not just in his own essays about contemporary politics but in books by his friends and fellow brights like thomas frank s unintentionally hilarious what s the matter with kansas _meta_end_dot_

 on the other hand the sort of violent divisiveness that he associates with nixonland rather conspicuously developed at the exact time that richard nixon was not a central part of the national political scene _meta_end_dot_

 inner city riots assassinations student demonstrations radical left terrorism all of these social plagues arose during the johnson great society years the pinnacle of the left s ascendancy _meta_end_dot_

 even the initial violent reactions were led by democrats like lbj sending federal troops into detroit or mayor daley breaking up protests at the _meta_number_ref_ democratic convention _meta_end_dot_

 if anything as mr _meta_end_dot_

 douthat suggests above the return of richard nixon a liberal republican in _meta_number_ref_ might be seen as an attempt by american voters to restore the social calm and consensus of earlier eras _meta_end_dot_

 richard nixon at least in his final incarnation should probably be considered an effect of the social breakdown of the liberal _meta_number_ref_s rather than a cause of anything much _meta_end_dot_

 as president nixon was no conservative particularly in his domestic governance which much more of an extension of lbj than any sort of warm up act for the gipper _meta_end_dot_

 and nixon s poor handling of the economy directly paved the way for the disastrous carter years which spawned the economic trainwreck that reagan and paul volker would miraculously right but to the america of _meta_number_ref_ that didn t think that bonnie clyde were the good guys and the bourgeois householders were the bad guys no wonder both nixon s association with the relative calm of the eisenhower years at least in comparison with what was to come afterwards and his promise of law and order sounded remarkably appealing _meta_end_dot_

 in that sense perhaps nixon s entirely unplanned timeout from the national scene during the mid _meta_number_ref_s wound up serving him remarkably well _meta_end_dot_
