  after reviewing the _meta_number_ref_ senate vote ratings at the nonpartisan national journal i m starting to make sense of joe biden as obama s vp pick _meta_end_dot_

 the obamessiah has promised to unite the country despite being the most extreme leftist in the entire senate _meta_end_dot_

 that s where biden comes in obama could have gone with the second most extreme leftist sheldon whitehouse _meta_end_dot_

 but in the spirit of bipartisan cooperation he went for the third most extreme leftist _meta_end_dot_

 if he really wanted to build bridges he could have picked socialist bernie sanders at _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 but no doubt obama was advised not to go overboard and risk alienating his base _meta_end_dot_

 hat tip america is an obamanation _meta_end_exclamation_

 cross posted at moonbattery _meta_end_dot_
