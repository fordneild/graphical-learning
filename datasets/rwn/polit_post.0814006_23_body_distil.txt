  we can t drive our suvs and eat as much as we want and keep our homes on _meta_number_ref_ degrees at all times _meta_end_dot_

 and then just expect that other countries are going to say ok obama said _meta_end_dot_

 that s not leadership _meta_end_dot_

 that s not going to happen he added barack obama let s see what changes we ll apparently see under obama suv s will be outlawed we will no longer eat as much as we want we will no longer be able to set our thermostats as high as _meta_number_ref_ degrees and it will be vitally important that we get other countries to say ok to us about those issues _meta_end_dot_

 wow it almost makes you pine for the days when john kerry just wanted us to pass a global test doesn t it _meta_end_question_
