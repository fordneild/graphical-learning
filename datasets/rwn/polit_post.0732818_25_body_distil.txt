  millions upon millions of people go shopping the day after thanksgiving nicknamed black friday _meta_end_dot_

 i usually avoid this at any cost possible _meta_end_dot_

 i do not like crowds i don t particularly enjoy shopping any time of the year and i d rather get my clothes from target than some over priced store at a mall _meta_end_dot_

 however this year my sixteen year old cousin was in town from massachusetts and had never seen anything like jacksonville s st _meta_end_dot_

 john s town center and was dying to go _meta_end_dot_

 technically it s just an outdoor shopping mall _meta_end_dot_

 but there s a lot more to do than just shop _meta_end_dot_

 there are fantastic restaurants we never had in jacksonville before p f _meta_end_dot_

 chang s the cheesecake factory maggiano s little italy stores we never had before like louis vutton and coach not to mention tons of entertainment options _meta_end_dot_

 i suppose for a sixteen year old with cash to burn it s heaven _meta_end_dot_

 so off to the town center we went my cousin and i _meta_end_dot_

 we paid _meta_dollor_ref_ for valet parking to avoid having to drive around for _meta_number_ref_ minutes looking for a space as the radio was advertising that the town center parking lot was _meta_percent_ref_ full _meta_end_dot_

 we went browsing at pretty much every female clothing store in the mall _meta_end_dot_

 none of it was really new to me _meta_end_dot_

 it was fun at first especially listening to my cousin from massachusetts complain about the sales tax we have here _meta_end_dot_

 i giggled at that all day someone from massachusetts complaining about taxes _meta_end_dot_

 we went into american eagle abercrombie fitch lucky buckle _meta_end_dot_

 seemingly every store for girls that existed _meta_end_dot_

 the only one i had never been into however was urban outfitters _meta_end_dot_

 i d heard of it seen the catalog but had never actually seen the store itself _meta_end_dot_

 my cousin made a beeline for it and inside we went to look around _meta_end_dot_

 it seemed like your typical teen store _meta_end_dot_

 we wandered over by some graphic t s when my sixteen year old cousin picked up a red shirt emblazoned with the words buck fush _meta_end_dot_

 what does that mean she asked _meta_end_dot_

 i rolled my eyes muttered creative and told her to switch the b and the f _meta_end_dot_

 after that i got curious as to just what kinds of stuff they were selling there _meta_end_dot_

 i started browsing a little more _meta_end_dot_

 and when i got home i looked up their website to see more _meta_end_dot_

 i laughed at first looking at the models on the website _meta_end_dot_

 every single one of them looked unwashed and unkempt with stringy hair a washed out complexion and a glazed look in their eyes _meta_end_dot_

 it reminded me of the rock star look rock stars who had just recovered from nearly oding on heroin or some other hard drug _meta_end_dot_

 the clothes themselves though didn t make me laugh _meta_end_dot_

 what i found told me that urban outfitters could probably start selling tinfoil hats in their accessories department because in actuality it s clothing suited for residents of liberal land _meta_end_dot_

 these are the political shirts they had to offer buck fush shut up and vote _meta_end_exclamation_

 peace is pricele_meta_beep_ref_ freedom is fought not bought g is for giuliani obama for yo mama hillary is my homegirl the only arms we need with children i think hugging it was hard to tell vote for a better tomorrow drop knowledge not bombs anything war can do peace can do better increase the peace vote for change war _meta_end_exclamation_

 what is it good for _meta_end_question_

 with a picture of a fist with a certain finger sticking up except instead of a finger it s the silhouette of a gi war is over _meta_end_exclamation_

 if you want it arms are for hugging friends don t let friends vote republican power to the peaceful peace now cbo_meta_number_ref_oaa caoba with a picture of a blindfolded man speaking into a microphone labeled free speech t save me with a picture of the earth crying war with a picture of a sad face crying it s getting too hot in here labeled global warming t think green brains not bombs i think the only liberal talking point they didn t cover was abortion _meta_end_dot_

 the tagline could be kill babies not terrorists or fight life the cynical side of me wasn t surprised in the least _meta_end_dot_

 it did however make me a little sad to think of teenagers walking around with these shirts on not really understanding the statement they were making _meta_end_dot_

 they d probably look at the shirt screaming peace now and think nothing of wearing it after all who doesn t want peace _meta_end_question_

 i noticed there were no f is for fred t shirts or friends don t let friends vote democrat t shirts _meta_end_dot_

 there was nothing about give freedom a chance or support our troops or do the right thing no kuck ferry or huck fillary _meta_end_dot_

 no it was just your typical bratty liberal talking points _meta_end_dot_

 but hey this is the only way liberals can get their audience right _meta_end_question_

 drive those talking points home at a young age so they grow up believing them _meta_end_dot_

 luckily my cousin was not interested in any of those shirts she actually thought the buck fush shirt was the dumbest thing she d ever seen and we left the store rather quickly _meta_end_dot_

 it would be nice though to maybe see a store that gave an option to us conservatives although i think most conservatives have more class than to wear a shirt that says huck fillary unfortunately as i said before a fifteen year old won t get the obnoxiousness of it the bratty liberal message they re sending _meta_end_dot_

 it s just another t shirt to them with a cool slogan on it and while urban outfitters was by far the most blatant about it that i saw at least shirts with liberal bleating on them are by no means uncommon _meta_end_dot_

 it really is too bad _meta_end_dot_
