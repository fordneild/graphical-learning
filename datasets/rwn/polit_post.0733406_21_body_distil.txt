  perhaps the biggest oddity of the republican primary season so far has been that gop voters keep saying that they want another reagan the candidates keep comparing themselves to reagan at every opportunity and yet the man who is leading in the national polls rudy giuliani is about as far apart from reagan as it s possible to get ideologically while still remaining in the republican party _meta_end_dot_

 rudy giuliani is no reagan _meta_end_dot_

 what he is and what he would be if he gets the nomination is our bill clinton _meta_end_dot_

 consider a few things _meta_end_dot_

 yes bill clinton was impeached for perjury not for having an affair but conservatives relentlessly bashed bill clinton throughout the nineties for cheating on his wife and degrading the office _meta_end_dot_

 well morally rudy giuliani is every bit as sleazy as bill clinton _meta_end_dot_

 he has been married _meta_number_ref_ times which could be forgivable in a president but he also cheated on his second wife with his current wife judith nathan and announced his separation from wife number two donna hanover to her and the world at the same time at a press conference _meta_end_dot_

 this has seldom been discussed during the primary season which is rather bizarre given that the biggest knock against newt gingrich that i heard when he was thinking about running from the readers on my blog and other bloggers privately was that they were disgusted by his affairs and shabby treatment of his former wife _meta_end_dot_

 yet rudy whose clintonesque private behavior is every bit as appalling as newt s has gotten a pass on the issue _meta_end_dot_

 folks if you think that nominating a man as sleazy as rudy isn t going to come back and bite the gop in the general election after the way we complained about clinton during the nineties you re kidding yourself _meta_end_dot_

 moreover if you think it s out of the realm of possibility that giuliani would diddle some intern in a back office somewhere once he got out from under the watchful gaze of his wife you re giving him way too much credit _meta_end_dot_

 any man who will cheat on his second wife will cheat on his third wife too if the opportunity presents itself _meta_end_dot_

 the clintons are also known for the shady cast of characters who surround them _meta_end_dot_

 we re talking about people like sandy berger anthony pellicano charlie trie norman hsu and anthony rodham _meta_end_dot_

 well there are early indications that rudy giuliani is just as careless as the clintons about whom he hangs around with _meta_end_dot_

 we already know about bernie kerik rudy s pal and business partner who is facing _meta_number_ref_ years in prison but rudy also continues to be closely associated with alan placa a catholic priest who has been credibly accused by multiple former victims of child molestation _meta_end_dot_

 how many of these people surround rudy and do you really want to spend _meta_number_ref_ explaining them away the way dems have to try to explain away people like sandy berger norman hsu _meta_end_question_

 another thing that people often forget about bill clinton is that his biggest accomplishments welfare reform nafta and balancing the budget were near and dear to the hearts of republicans not democrats _meta_end_dot_

 that brings us to rudy giuliani the real giuliani not the guy who keeps trying to convince everyone that he s a diehard conservative _meta_end_dot_

 the truth is that rudy giuliani is not a conservative _meta_end_dot_

 he s a rockefeller republican a rino a tougher more charismatic version of arlen specter which is why it s mind boggling that so many conservatives who are furious at george bush and senators like lindsey graham john warner and trent lott for not being conservative enough are happily backing giuliani _meta_end_dot_

 don t kid yourself graham lott warner and george w _meta_end_dot_

 bush are all considerably to the right of rudy giuliani _meta_end_dot_

 just take a look at what national journal said about rudy the national journal s rating system put him at _meta_number_ref_ percent conservative and _meta_number_ref_ percent liberal on economic issues in _meta_number_ref_ and assessed him as liberal by _meta_number_ref_ to _meta_number_ref_ percent in looking at his social issues votes we re talking about a guy whose record is pro abortion even pro partial birth abortion pro gun control and pro illegal immigration _meta_end_dot_

 we re talking about a guy who was endorsed by new york s liberal party in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 rudy even personally endorsed mario cuomo and said he was open to endorsing bill clinton _meta_end_dot_

 this is not a man who is going to make republicans happy if he becomes president _meta_end_dot_

 yes he would be better than hillary but he would also break the hearts of conservatives over and over again on issues that we deeply care about if he gets into office _meta_end_dot_

 now i want to be clear about something if rudy giuliani captures the nomination i will vote for him and i would strongly encourage you to do the same _meta_end_dot_

 but i can t pretend to be even the tiniest bit enthusiastic about having rudy as our nominee _meta_end_dot_

 to the contrary rudy is a dangerous candidate for the gop _meta_end_dot_

 he could potentially tear the fabric of the republican party asunder by alienating millions of pro life social conservatives so badly that they may vote for a third party candidate or turn away from the republican party entirely _meta_end_dot_

 that means a rudy giuliani candidacy could seriously damage the coalition that has delivered so many victories for the gop from _meta_number_ref_ forward _meta_end_dot_

 additionally it s worth noting that while the rudy is the most electable candidate shtick seems plausible at first glance it s pure vapor no more solid than the john kerry is our most electable candidate nonsense that democrats bought into hook line and sinker back in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 why is that _meta_end_question_

 because millions of pro life republicans would stay home in _meta_number_ref_ if rudy is the nominee _meta_end_dot_

 because it seems unlikely that a pro abortion new yorker running as a republican could carry every southern state _meta_end_dot_

 because most importantly he is not currently beating hillary clinton in head to head polls in any state that george bush didn t win in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 in other words he doesn t live up to the hype that says he s going to put several key blue states into play _meta_end_dot_

 so if you take away the electability angle from rudy giuliani what s left that makes him appealing to conservatives _meta_end_question_

 put another way if you love rinos like arlen specter and lincoln chafee rudy may be a good choice for you _meta_end_dot_

 if you re sick of social conservatives and would like to see their agenda rejected even if it risks turning large numbers of them off to the republican party vote rudy _meta_end_dot_

 if you think that rudy is the most electable candidate and your only concern is beating hillary i don t think that you re right but i do understand backing giuliani for that reason _meta_end_dot_

 however if that s not what you re looking for there is still time to choose another candidate _meta_end_dot_

 long story short conservatives who are backing rudy should go into it eyes wide open and understand exactly what they re getting _meta_end_dot_

 they re getting a republican bill clinton an ethically compromised candidate that republicans will constantly have to apologize for and who is destined to disappoint conservatives either by losing in _meta_number_ref_ or by winning and then opposing us on many of the issues we care about most once he gets into office _meta_end_dot_
