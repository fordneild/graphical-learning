 i support president bush and his strategy of taking the fight directly to the terrorists throughout the mideast _meta_end_dot_

 as proof of that commitment i have secured funding for townsburg s new homeland security department multicultural sensitivity training center _meta_end_dot_

 bristol dear _meta_number_ref_rd district voter in a scandal driven _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ media world that all too often distracted by poorly sourced rumors of rest stop page parties or bankok orgies it s easy to forget the things that really matter _meta_end_dot_

 things like working tirelessly for the people which i continue to do in my many committee chairmanships _meta_end_dot_

 and also being responsive to constituents _meta_end_dot_

 for example the latest _meta_number_ref_ townsburgh gazette poll indicates that many of you are dissatisfied with the war in iraq _meta_end_dot_

 as a longtime voice of opposition to the bush administration on the war especially the parts that aren t going well i have organized a special select committee to investigate and fix blame and set a timetable for withdrawal tied to tracking poll benchmarks _meta_end_dot_

 that s the kind of leadership you will continue to get with me jerry bristol _meta_end_dot_

 all due to the tireless work of jerry bristol ranking minority member of the house transportation subcommittee for bridges _meta_end_dot_

 it s that proud _meta_number_ref_ year record of rock solid principled bipartisanship that has made jerry bristol a legend in congress and earned the endorsement of the national bridge contractors association and tollbooth workers local _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 it s a can do spirit that figures out how to get things done for you even when that spirit is confined to home in an ankle monitor _meta_end_dot_

 with a record like that can the _meta_number_ref_rd district really afford sending a untested newcomer like chuck larson jr _meta_end_dot_
