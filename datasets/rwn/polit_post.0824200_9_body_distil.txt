  b ill clinton s speech last night was vintage clinton _meta_end_dot_

 and there is no question that to those will not dig under his words it was effective _meta_end_dot_

 but it was vintage in another way as well it was quite deceptive _meta_end_dot_

 for instance he recalled that _meta_number_ref_ years ago republicans said i was too young and too inexperienced to be commander in chief _meta_end_dot_

 sound familiar _meta_end_question_

 it didn t work in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 and it will not work in _meta_number_ref_ of course the rap against obama isn t he s too young as clinton would have you believe but that he is too inexperienced _meta_end_dot_

 when clinton ran he had been a governor of a state for over _meta_number_ref_ years _meta_end_dot_

 so he literally had _meta_number_ref_ times the executive experience obama so clearly lacks _meta_end_dot_

 there is no comparison between a governor of _meta_number_ref_ years and a community organizer with a couple of years in the senate _meta_end_dot_

 but it was a nice try at reframing the argument against obama in an attempt to neutralize it _meta_end_dot_

 for those able to think independently it didn t work however _meta_end_dot_

 the rest from both he and biden was mostly declaration and assertion earlier former president bill clinton put aside divisions of the primary season and delivered an enthusiastic endorsement saying barack obama is ready to be president of the united states clinton said obama s heritage and experience give him a unique capacity to lead our increasingly diverse nation and restore its leadership in the world _meta_end_dot_

 he has the intelligence and curiosity every successful president needs the former president said _meta_end_dot_

 his policies on the economy taxes health care and energy are far superior to the republican alternatives _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 the long hard primary tested and strengthened him _meta_end_dot_

 he s ready because of his heritage _meta_end_question_

 curiosity _meta_end_question_

 intelligence _meta_end_question_

 clinton just described _meta_number_ref_ million people and probably half of them have executive experience _meta_end_dot_

 obama s resume is so thin that his most ardent backers and even those who aren t quite as ardent as they pretend to be are reduced to heritage curiosity and intelligence as major qualifications for the office _meta_end_dot_

 accomplishments _meta_end_question_

 not yet but if you like potential elect him president and let him try out his first executive job in the white house _meta_end_dot_

 yeah that s the ticket _meta_end_dot_

 the mccain answer _meta_end_question_
