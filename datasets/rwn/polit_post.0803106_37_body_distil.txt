  i have to admit i m scratching my head a little bit about john edwards decision to drop out of the democratic race _meta_end_dot_

 granted he didn t have a chance to win but he has essentially been out of it since he lost iowa _meta_end_dot_

 moreover weirdly as mickey kaus points out comes now news that edwards is dropping out _meta_end_dot_

 that was sudden no _meta_end_question_

 it seems like only yesterday because it was that his deputy campaign manager jonathan prince was quoted boasting to reporters that in the worst case scenario edwards would control _meta_number_ref_ to _meta_number_ref_ percent of the delegates at the convention and would probably play a decisive role _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 alert reader d e _meta_end_dot_

 reports that the headline in his print edition of today s los angeles times is edwards onward he s told skeptics before he s in it for the long haul _meta_end_dot_

 more edwards was still sending out fundraising appeals tuesday morning _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 in any case whatever edwards motivation is his pull out from the race could be a game changer although it s less clear today than it once was what that change will be _meta_end_dot_

 according to gallup obama has been creeping up nationally on hillary _meta_end_dot_

 rasmussen has them separated by a smaller margin about _meta_number_ref_ points but that s still a considerably smaller gap than the _meta_number_ref_ points edwards is currently pulling in _meta_end_dot_

 conventional wisdom is that edwards supporters will gravitate towards barack obama because they re more similar candidates but given how racially polarized the democratic race has become you have to wonder if hillary will take a larger share of edwards voters than people initially thought because white liberals won t be able to bring themselves to vote for the black candidate still clinton has a big enough lead in key super tuesday states like new york new jersey and california to probably beat obama even if most of edwards supporters move over to obama _meta_end_dot_

 still obama isn t giving any indication that he s going to get out after super tuesday and if obama s numbers continue to be better than hillary s in a general election contest it may enable him to gain steam over time _meta_end_dot_
