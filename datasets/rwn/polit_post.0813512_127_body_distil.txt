  i do not think the president of the united states should be a liar and believe that the overwhelming majority of u s _meta_end_dot_

 citizens agree with me jimmy carter now from my interview with robert novak john hawkins in your book you really go out of your way to emphasize how often jimmy carter lied about things _meta_end_dot_

 robert novak laughs john hawkins do you think that carter s frequent lying and the fact that he seemed to get away with it helped influence bill clinton to lie so often when he was president _meta_end_question_

 robert novak well i think bill clinton was a minor league liar compared to jimmy carter _meta_end_dot_

 carter would just lie for the sake of lying _meta_end_dot_

 he was absolutely incredible _meta_end_dot_

 i put a lot of the cases in the book i couldn t put all of them in but my two favorite cases are in the book _meta_end_dot_

 i had written a column detailing nine separate lies by carter and he told another reporter that i had apologized to him for it _meta_end_dot_

 that was just an absolute lie _meta_end_dot_

 then many years after his presidency my late partner rowly evans and i had a party celebrating the _meta_number_ref_th anniversary of our column and we invited all the presidents and ex presidents to send letters _meta_end_dot_

 nixon didn t like us much but he sent a nice letter _meta_end_dot_

 but carter told an aide that the last thing he would do was send any kind of greeting to those guys _meta_end_dot_

 that year in _meta_number_ref_ at the democratic national convention there was a reception at the carter center in atlanta and as my partner was going through the line i told my partner not to do it and he said to carter mr _meta_end_dot_

 president how come you didn t send us a message for our _meta_number_ref_th anniversary he said well rowly if i had known i certainly would have sent it _meta_end_dot_

 it must have gotten lost in the mail
