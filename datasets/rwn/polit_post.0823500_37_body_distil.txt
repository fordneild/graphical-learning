  once again new jersey seems to be vying for the title of the most radically liberal state in the country _meta_end_dot_

 fortunately nj assemblyman mike doherty has shown himself to be one of the best guys we have got fighting for us _meta_end_dot_

 while far too many of our republican officials are apathetic or too afraid to bring up issues that concern the social conservative or else take a liberal stance themselves doherty doesn t seem to quiver at the challenge _meta_end_dot_

 in fact he ll take the lead _meta_end_dot_

 this time new jersey news is reporting that just after garden state equality a gay rights activist group released poll results showing that most nj voters favor legalizing gay marriage doherty is calling for an amendment to be passed that would let the voters decide _meta_end_dot_

 the people of new jersey should have the final say on this fundamental issue and it s time to allow their voices to be heard so that we can put this diversion behind us and move forward on real issues that are affecting our residents said doherty in a press release _meta_end_dot_

 the poll which was released yesterday found that new jersey voters support allowing gays to marry by a margin of _meta_percent_ref_ to _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 doherty said that the gay marriage issue was a smokescreen to distract voters from gov _meta_end_dot_

 corzine s low poll numbers a high cost of living a back breaking debt and high property taxes _meta_end_dot_

 he said that the issue was raised last year to distract from gov _meta_end_dot_

 corzine s highly unpopular and now dead asset monetization plan _meta_end_dot_

 it seems a pattern has emerged where mr _meta_end_dot_

 goldstein chair of garden state equality and other funded agitators pop up when necessary to run interference for the corzine administration and other democrats when they are either considering unpopular proposals such as their highly controversial asset monetization scheme or an official s low performance ratings he said _meta_end_dot_

 either way it s a constant agitation of society much like former president bill clinton s wag the dog antics to keep the heat off of his personal indiscretions _meta_end_dot_

 doherty is suggesting that if these activists are as confident as they say they are in the opinions of new jersey residents and actually care what we think then they should prove it by supporting a vote on the issue _meta_end_dot_

 instead this is the last thing garden state equality wants _meta_end_dot_

 goldstein cast the marriage question as a civil rights issue and noted that americans traditionally do not vote on those questions _meta_end_dot_

 in america you don t take public referenda on voting rights women s rights the right to have a society free of prejudice _meta_end_dot_

 civil unions are as offensive to gay people as separate facilities would be to other groups based on who they are he said _meta_end_dot_

 i m not sure what these guys are so afraid of _meta_end_dot_

 and for all their claims that gay marriage is a civil rights issue the rest of american society has been very slow to catch on _meta_end_dot_

 so has the u s _meta_end_dot_

 constitution _meta_end_dot_

 doherty clearly understands this and cleverly undermines the basis of goldstein s claim _meta_end_dot_

 it goes to the heart of the question of where constitutional rights come from _meta_end_dot_

 some people would say they come from our creator and the constitution is put into place to protect those god given rights _meta_end_dot_

 for those who say that there is no god they say they certainly can t come from government they should come from the people _meta_end_dot_

 that s all i m saying here let the people of new jersey decide _meta_end_dot_

 thanks for standing up for the people mike _meta_end_dot_

 at least someone will _meta_end_dot_

 cross posted at conservatives with attitude _meta_end_exclamation_
