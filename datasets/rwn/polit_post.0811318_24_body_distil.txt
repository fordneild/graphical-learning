  mitch daniels has been flogged for some comments he made about ronald reagan indiana gov _meta_end_dot_

 mitch daniels elicited several hushed gasps and raised eyebrows late last week as he lectured a conservative crowd that it was time to let ronald reagan go the governor delivered his remarks to a room full of fellow red staters at the fund for american studies annual conference and donor retreat at the newseum _meta_end_dot_

 nostalgia is fine and reagan s economic plan was good daniels said _meta_end_dot_

 but we need to look towards the future rather than staying in the past daniels added that the gop needed to work on uniting behind sen _meta_end_dot_

 john mccain instead of constantly comparing the arizona senator with the gipper _meta_end_dot_

 there s not enough context there to know exactly what daniels was driving at but i do think that the conservative movement needs to make a shift in regards to ronald reagan _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ trying to run on ronald reagan s agenda is a political loser _meta_end_dot_

 by that i mean that a lot of the impact issues of _meta_number_ref_ and _meta_number_ref_ have lost their oomph over time _meta_end_dot_

 crime was a big issue back then and so was welfare the income tax stagflation and winning the cold war _meta_end_dot_

 moreover there are crucial issues today health care illegal immigration and the war on terror for example that simply weren t big issues in reagan s time _meta_end_dot_

 sure there are some issues that carry over but conservatives simply cannot run on reagan s agenda and sweep the country any more than democrats could win today by copying fdr s agenda or reagan could have won had he adopted goldwater s agenda en masse _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ so does that mean we should reject reagan _meta_end_question_

 no absolutely not _meta_end_dot_

 conservatives have proven time and time again that they can win national elections running on a conservative agenda _meta_end_dot_

 so what we need to do is apply reagan s principles to the issues people care about not reagan s agenda _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ john mccain who is a moderate telling everyone who will listen that he s conservative doesn t measure up to ronald reagan _meta_end_dot_

 however the truth is that very few people do _meta_end_dot_

 great presidents like reagan don t come along very often _meta_end_dot_

 in fact by my estimation there were exactly two great presidents in the last century teddy roosevelt and ronald reagan _meta_end_dot_

 fdr could be fairly called a great war president but his domestic agenda was a disaster for the country _meta_end_dot_

 truman _meta_end_question_

 kennedy _meta_end_question_

 wilson _meta_end_question_

 they didn t rise to the level of greatness that reagan did _meta_end_dot_

 so think about that _meta_number_ref_ great presidents in a _meta_number_ref_ year span more than _meta_number_ref_ years apart _meta_end_dot_

 so if you re waiting for the next republican candidate who measures up to reagan and i m just talking about the real reagan not the sanitized reagan who has had his mistakes and non conservative positions airbrushed out you re probably going to be waiting a few decades more _meta_end_dot_

 on top of that great presidents are often very different from each other _meta_end_dot_

 so the next great president may have many of the same principles reagan did but he s not going to sound exactly like reagan or have the same agenda as reagan _meta_end_dot_

 long story short ronald reagan was one of the greatest presidents we ever had and i d rank him just behind winston churchill as the _meta_number_ref_nd greatest man of the _meta_number_ref_th century _meta_end_dot_

 that being said the republican party would be better off looking towards the future rather than staying in the past in regards to reagan _meta_end_dot_
