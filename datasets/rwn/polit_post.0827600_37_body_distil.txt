  what if ronald reagan was wrong _meta_end_question_

 he championed supply side economics and through his policies created deficit spending _meta_end_dot_

 and yes i acknowledge the trade off of bringing down the soviet empire was worth it in the near term but what did that action create in the long term it seems self evident that tax and spend is wrong _meta_end_dot_

 the democrats simply want to redistribute wealth from those who work to those who don t _meta_end_dot_

 it seem equally evident now that tax and borrow is wrong _meta_end_dot_

 which came first _meta_end_question_

 an american culture where people lived beyond their means or a government whose policies encouraged and enabled living beyond one s means _meta_end_question_

 it doesn t matter now because way too many americans possibly even a majority are too used to being a recipient of government largesse _meta_end_dot_

 and many expect more the baby boomers face retirement and drawing social security after all _meta_end_dot_

 perhaps this greedy impulse and irresponsibility indicates a moral shift where people seek to avoid paying their own way _meta_end_dot_

 this is profoundly un american where self reliance was a founding principle _meta_end_dot_

 perhaps people raised with a sense of entitlement cannot fathom going back to living with restraint no one likes being told no _meta_end_dot_

 the reality is that many things americans expect as a need is a want _meta_end_dot_

 the working poor we hear so much about have their x boxes and iphones and video games and digital cable _meta_end_dot_

 these are not needs _meta_end_dot_

 they are wants _meta_end_dot_

 food is a need _meta_end_dot_

 indoor plumbing is a need _meta_end_dot_

 water is a need _meta_end_dot_

 a roof over the head is a need _meta_end_dot_

 clothing is a need _meta_end_dot_

 and another thing democrats make no secret that they believe big government is the solution _meta_end_dot_

 barack obama wants more early childhood education _meta_end_dot_

 he wants less military spending and more health care spending _meta_end_dot_

 he wants the government to regulate and control nearly everything _meta_end_dot_

 he believes that government is good _meta_end_dot_

 he wants taxes by the rich aka you to pay for his pie in the sky programs _meta_end_dot_

 he dreams big and believes that redistributing money is fair _meta_end_dot_

 republicans in contrast say that small government and a strong private sector is the solution while they increase all sorts of gluttonous spending _meta_end_dot_

 it is hypocritical and it is what outrages fiscal conservatives _meta_end_dot_

 it is what many conservatives consider democrat lite _meta_end_dot_

 and this current bill the one the senate just passed feels like enabling this greedy behavior _meta_end_dot_

 people who have lived within their means won t be bailed out _meta_end_dot_

 people who bought homes conservatively who didn t jump at teaser rates don t want their taxes to go to people who felt entitled to live large _meta_end_dot_

 this is harsh but average americans who have played by the rules want some pain _meta_end_dot_

 people who have been stupid those who took more loans than they could afford and the banks who gave it to them and the government who facilitated this nonsense should pay a price _meta_end_dot_

 it s usually called bankruptcy _meta_end_dot_

 a consequence of this mess is that people who have played by the rules who do deserve a line of credit can t get one _meta_end_dot_

 businesses that rotate through a line of credit to maintain stock for example can t get money and can t do business _meta_end_dot_

 other people can t get loans now _meta_end_dot_

 so a car dealership isn t selling as many cars because many borderline people can t get loans _meta_end_dot_

 this is going to cause the economy pain _meta_end_dot_

 pain all around _meta_end_dot_

 but should the pain be avoided _meta_end_question_

 if we avoid it now does it just prolong this indulgent selfish american behavior _meta_end_question_

 some people in fact many people commenting and writing and talking to me think so _meta_end_dot_

 many believe it s a time for pain _meta_end_dot_

 and right now the democrats are looking more honest _meta_end_dot_

 people know what to expect of them no matter if it s tax and spend _meta_end_dot_

 republicans preach small government low taxes but that s not what they ve been practicing _meta_end_dot_

 if the house republicans ignore this swell among the populace they will pay _meta_end_dot_

 americans especially fiscal conservatives are outraged _meta_end_dot_

 i have never heard such vitriol and frustration _meta_end_dot_

 it seems to be conventional wisdom that businesses start grow and survive living on credit _meta_end_dot_

 ditto individuals _meta_end_dot_

 but is that right _meta_end_question_

 america has morphed into a debtor nation while still making people pay egregious taxes _meta_end_dot_

 it s the worst of all worlds _meta_end_dot_

 everyone starting with the government needs to live within their means _meta_end_dot_
