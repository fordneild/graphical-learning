  chuck todd is a generally solid lefty political analyst who occasionally lets his political leanings affect his judgment _meta_end_dot_

 here s an intriguing but skewed analysis of the electoral map that he helped create obama s wider map about two months ago we unveiled our early look at the electoral map _meta_end_dot_

 and this being the second official day of the general election now s as good a time as any to see where we stand in the mccain vs _meta_end_dot_

 obama race _meta_end_dot_

 base obama ca ct de dc hi il md ma ny ri vt _meta_number_ref_ electoral votes toss up co fl ia mi nv nm nh oh pa va wi _meta_number_ref_ votes base mccain al ak az id ks ky ok sc sd tn tx ut wv wy _meta_number_ref_ votes while both mccain and obama get to _meta_number_ref_ when adding up their base and lean states it s clear to see that obama has an early edge with the map _meta_end_dot_

 not only does he have a stronger base than mccain does _meta_number_ref_ votes vs _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ but he also has more potential pick up opportunities _meta_end_dot_

 when you add toss up and lean mccain obama has the potential for another _meta_number_ref_ votes outside his favored states _meta_end_dot_

 by comparison mccain s toss up and lean obama comes to _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 of course potential sometimes means just that potential _meta_end_dot_

 at the end of the day obama will likely win few if any of those lean mccain states _meta_end_dot_

 but his reach right now seems much longer than mccain s _meta_end_dot_

 there are two problems with this analysis that i see _meta_end_dot_

 the first issue is one that todd and company touch upon neither mccain nor obama is likely to win any of the states that are leaning in the other direction _meta_end_dot_

 admittedly it could happen but it probably won t _meta_end_dot_

 what that means is that in their breakdown both candidates start out with the same number of safe electoral votes _meta_end_dot_

 in other words the wider map really doesn t pan out _meta_end_dot_

 now here s the real kicker given how it has been polling so far and the demographics of the state florida should probably be in the lean mccain category instead of being treated as a toss up _meta_end_dot_

 so if we move florida s _meta_number_ref_ electoral votes into the lean mccain category here s what we get obama base and lean _meta_number_ref_ toss up _meta_number_ref_ how s that map looking now _meta_end_question_

 ps this doesn t mean mccain is necessarily going to win because it could still go either way but at least for the moment mccain still looks more likely to come out on top in november _meta_end_dot_
