  one of the things i do over on my site every sunday is post a patriotic pinup the painted types _meta_end_dot_

 this one is a few years old added in the flag background _meta_end_dot_

 never been able to figure out who the artist is though memorial day originally called decoration day is a day of remembrance for those who have died in our nation s service _meta_end_dot_

 there are many stories as to its actual beginnings with over two dozen cities and towns laying claim to being the birthplace of memorial day _meta_end_dot_

 there is also evidence that organized women s groups in the south were decorating graves before the end of the civil war a hymn published in _meta_number_ref_ kneel where our loves are sleeping by nella l _meta_end_dot_

 sweet carried the dedication to the ladies of the south who are decorating the graves of the confederate dead source duke university s historic american sheet music _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 while waterloo n y _meta_end_dot_

 was officially declared the birthplace of memorial day by president lyndon johnson in may _meta_number_ref_ it s difficult to prove conclusively the origins of the day _meta_end_dot_

 it is more likely that it had many separate beginnings each of those towns and every planned or spontaneous gathering of people to honor the war dead in the _meta_number_ref_ s tapped into the general human need to honor our dead each contributed honorably to the growing movement that culminated in gen logan giving his official proclamation in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 it is not important who was the very first what is important is that memorial day was established _meta_end_dot_

 memorial day is not about division _meta_end_dot_

 it is about reconciliation it is about coming together to honor those who gave their all _meta_end_dot_
