  the new york times is running a poor poor pitiful me story about an illegal immigrant who happily was deported by a hospital that was sued in return for doing a good deed eight years ago luis alberto jimenez now _meta_number_ref_ an illegal immigrant working as a gardener in stuart fla suffered devastating injuries in a car crash with a drunken floridian _meta_end_dot_

 a community hospital saved his life twice and after failing to find a rehabilitation center willing to accept an uninsured patient kept him as a ward for years at a cost of _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ million _meta_end_dot_

 what happened next set the stage for a legal battle with nationwide repercussions jimenez was deported not by the federal government but by martin memorial hospital _meta_end_dot_

 after winning a state court order that would later be declared invalid martin memorial leased an air ambulance for _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ and forcibly returned him to his home country as one hospital administrator described it _meta_end_dot_

 since returning home jimenez who sustained a traumatic brain injury has received no medical care or medication just alka seltzer and prayer said his _meta_number_ref_ year old mother _meta_end_dot_

 in the past year his condition has deteriorated with routine seizures _meta_end_dot_

 some advocates for immigrants see these repatriations as a kind of international patient dumping _meta_end_dot_

 hospital administrators view such cases as costly burdensome patient transfers that force them to shoulder responsibility for the dysfunctional immigration and health care systems _meta_end_dot_

 in many cases they said the only alternative to repatriation is keeping patients indefinitely in acute care hospitals _meta_end_dot_

 what that does for us it puts a strain on our system where we re unable to provide adequate care for our own citizens said alan kelly vice president of scottsdale healthcare in arizona _meta_end_dot_

 in jimenez s case the hospital s doctors determined appropriate post hospital care meant traumatic brain injury rehabilitation _meta_end_dot_

 hospital discharge planners searched to no avail for a rehabilitation program or nursing home _meta_end_dot_

 michael banks a local lawyer representing jimenez s guardian a cousin by marriage took the position that the hospital had a responsibility to provide jimenez with the rehabilitation even if it meant paying a rehabilitation center _meta_end_dot_

 but the hospital declined as lord put it to take out our checkbook and subsidize jimenez s care at another institution _meta_end_dot_

 once you take that step for how long are you going to do that a year _meta_number_ref_ years _meta_number_ref_ years eventually the guatemalan health minister wrote a letter assuring martin memorial that his country was prepared to care for jimenez _meta_end_dot_

 after the guardian and the hospital reached an impasse martin memorial took the matter to court asking a state judge to compel relatives to cooperate with its repatriation plan _meta_end_dot_

 in june _meta_number_ref_ a hearing was held before circuit judge john fennelly _meta_end_dot_

 george bovie iii a lawyer for martin memorial told the judge this is a case about care for a man in this country illegally who has reached maximum medical improvement at our hospital and is ready to be discharged and whose home government is prepared to receive and treat him _meta_end_dot_

 banks said in response your honor this is a case about a hospital that has failed to do its job properly adding that the hospital sought to have this court legitimize its patient dumping by the time of the hearing jimenez was essentially a boarder at the hospital wheeling around the hallways and hanging out at the nursing stations _meta_end_dot_

 diana gregory a nurse who supervises case management and discharge planning said in a recent interview that jimenez became like family to hospital workers who bought him birthday cakes knitted him blankets and gave him toys _meta_end_dot_

 according to hospital records however it was not all pastries and presents _meta_end_dot_

 jimenez grew depressed and showed signs of regression _meta_end_dot_

 gregory said jimenez developed some disturbing habits including spitting yelling kicking and defecating on the floor _meta_end_dot_

 so let s see _meta_end_dot_

 we have an illegal alien who s not supposed to be here in the first place without health care who gets hurt _meta_end_dot_

 a hospital spends _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ million dollars taking care of him costs that will likely be passed on to american customers of the hospital to treat a guy who spits yells kicks and defecates on the floor _meta_end_dot_

 then after shipping him back to his own country where he should have been all along they re accused of being heartless and are being sued by a parasitic lawyer and the illegal s family _meta_end_dot_

 it s understandable that people may have sympathy for luis alberto jimenez but sympathy only goes so far _meta_end_dot_

 he wasn t supposed to be here _meta_end_dot_

 it s not the hospital s job to take care of the guy for the rest of his life _meta_end_dot_

 americans who go to that hospital shouldn t have to pay more money to cover the costs racked up by people who shouldn t even be in this country _meta_end_dot_

 luis alberto jimenez is a guatemalan citizen and he should be right where he is back in guatemala _meta_end_dot_

 if the treatment there isn t adequate i hate to say this but it s not our problem _meta_end_dot_

 the reality is that there are billions and that s billions with a b of people who don t get the same quality of medical care in their home countries that they would get if they were citizens of the united states even indigent citizens of the united states _meta_end_dot_

 as sad as that is we don t have the time the money or the responsibility to provide health care for them or for luis alberto jimenez particularly when we have americans complaining about how expensive our health care is every day _meta_end_dot_
