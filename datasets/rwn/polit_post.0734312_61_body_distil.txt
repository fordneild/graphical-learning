  o h joy the energy bill has passed the house _meta_end_dot_

 it appears to be policy disguised as a collection of mandates _meta_end_dot_

 on thursday just over a year after winning the majority democrats in the house of representatives voted through an energy bill that represents a stark departure from the administration s approach _meta_end_dot_

 it would raise vehicle fuel efficiency cafe standards for the first time in over _meta_number_ref_ years by _meta_percent_ref_ to _meta_number_ref_ miles per gallon for both cars and light trucks and suvs _meta_end_dot_

 a renewable energy standard mandates that utilities generate _meta_percent_ref_ of their power from renewables by _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 it would set a renewable fuel standard aiming to generate _meta_number_ref_ billion gallons of ethanol a year by _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 a tax package would roll back some _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_bn in oil industry subsidies and tax breaks to help pay for _meta_dollor_ref_bn worth of investments in clean energy development mainly in the form of investment tax credits for wind and solar along with the development and purchase of plug in hybrid vehicles _meta_end_dot_

 and it would raise efficiency standards for appliances and buildings _meta_end_dot_

 oh my how times have changed _meta_end_exclamation_

 massachusetts democratic ed markey chair of the house climate committee has called it the perfect political moment for a sea change in energy policy _meta_end_dot_

 oil prices are flirting with _meta_dollor_ref_ a barrel _meta_end_dot_

 let s parse this a little shall we _meta_end_question_

 it would raise vehicle fuel efficiency cafe standards for the first time in over _meta_number_ref_ years by _meta_percent_ref_ to _meta_number_ref_ miles per gallon for both cars and light trucks and suvs _meta_end_dot_

 and that will do what _meta_end_question_

 increase the price of automobiles _meta_end_dot_

 as usual it s a mandate for which you not anyone else get to pay _meta_end_dot_

 of course loopholes do survive big loopholes _meta_end_dot_

 dan becker an environmental consultant and lawyer and former official with the sierra club explains if i am g m god forbid and i produce a certain number of flexible fuel vehicles capable of running on e_meta_number_ref_ ethanol they will be assumed to be running on ethanol _meta_number_ref_ percent of the time _meta_end_dot_

 so the fuel economy of a _meta_number_ref_ m p g _meta_end_dot_

 truck that is technically capable of running on e_meta_number_ref_ will essentially be _meta_number_ref_ m p g _meta_end_dot_

 because the auto companies are not as stupid as they look they have chosen to make most of their flexible fuel vehicles their least efficient vehicles _meta_end_dot_

 so they get the maximum fuel economy benefit why aren t these vehicles running on e_meta_number_ref_ all the time _meta_end_question_

 because e_meta_number_ref_ is hard to find in many states _meta_end_dot_

 there are only about _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ stations selling e_meta_number_ref_ nationwide and only nine in new york according to the energy department _meta_end_dot_

 even if you can find e_meta_number_ref_ the mileage is often about _meta_number_ref_ percent worse than with gasoline because ethanol contains less energy per gallon _meta_end_dot_

 nevertheless for more than a decade the federal government has joined the auto industry in what amounts to make believe _meta_end_dot_

 that fantasy continues in this bill _meta_end_dot_

 no wonder mr _meta_end_dot_

 becker calls it the energizer bunny of auto industry loopholes indeed _meta_end_dot_

 flexible fuel hummers oh my _meta_end_dot_

 moving on to renewable energy a renewable energy standard mandates that utilities generate _meta_percent_ref_ of their power from renewables by _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 and that will require what _meta_end_question_

 well if your utility isn t generating any power from renewables right now it will be making a pretty hefty investment by _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 and who do you suppose will be paying for that _meta_end_question_

 it would set a renewable fuel standard aiming to generate _meta_number_ref_ billion gallons of ethanol a year by _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 aren t mandates fun _meta_end_question_

 of course those mandating seem to never do the math in this year s state of the union speech he set a national goal of producing _meta_number_ref_ billion gallons of alternative fuels by _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 the next morning c _meta_end_dot_

 ford runge who studies food and agriculture policy at the university of minnesota calculated that this would require _meta_number_ref_ percent of the current crop if it all came from corn _meta_end_dot_

 and sure enough even with the relatively small amount we produce we see food costs rising because of the diversion of food sources such as corn for both human and animal consumption to fuel while the science of converting cellulose to ethanol is both expensive and imperfect _meta_end_dot_

 so who do you suppose will pay for all of this in higher food prices _meta_end_question_

 to give you an idea of what is being mandated here consider that the world production of ethanol in _meta_number_ref_ was _meta_number_ref_ billion liters _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ billion gallons with _meta_percent_ref_ of the world supply coming from brazil and the united states _meta_end_dot_

 also consider that there is evidence that it takes more energy to produce ethanol than it produces when used although it is claimed that it produces _meta_percent_ref_ more energy than is consumed to make it _meta_end_dot_

 compare that with oil which has is at about _meta_percent_ref_ more energy produced than consumed to make it _meta_end_dot_

 and let s not forget the co_meta_number_ref_ ethanol produces when burned _meta_end_dot_

 a tax package would roll back some _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_bn in oil industry subsidies and tax breaks to help pay for _meta_dollor_ref_bn worth of investments in clean energy development mainly in the form of investment tax credits for wind and solar along with the development and purchase of plug in hybrid vehicles _meta_end_dot_

 now as you know i m not a friend of subsidies of any type but here we have oil at near _meta_dollor_ref_ a barrel and we re going to remove a big chunk of subsidies while giving tax credits to tiny industries which produce maybe a few percent of our present energy needs _meta_end_question_

 wow _meta_end_dot_

 any wonder who s going to pay for that _meta_end_question_

 but speaking of subsidies and loopholes we apparently don t mind subsidizing indonesia s biofuels for europe the christian science monitor recently reported that because of the way u s _meta_end_dot_

 biofuel laws are written foreign tankers loaded with indonesian biodiesel can stop briefly at an american port blend in a splash of regular petroleum diesel and qualify for a u s _meta_end_dot_

 subsidy on every gallon _meta_end_dot_

 it s called splash and dash because the tankers generally push on to europe to collect additional subsidies there _meta_end_dot_

 all in the name of greener fuels _meta_end_dot_

 yes your money is safe with congress an institution which always spends it wisely _meta_end_dot_

 sarcasm and it would raise efficiency standards for appliances and buildings _meta_end_dot_

 oh good _meta_end_dot_

 i m sure that s free of cost isn t it _meta_end_question_

 and yet we have some politician saying it is the perfect political moment to be doing this _meta_end_question_

 i refer you to my previous post about politicians on crack _meta_end_dot_

 as reported by the guardian this is hardly some sweet little energy bill in which everyone benefits although the author of the piece seems to think it borders on wonderful _meta_end_dot_

 in fact it is a raft of mandates which are going to cost huge amounts of money and if i were to guess deepen the energy crisis not alleviate it _meta_end_dot_

 in the short run fossil fuels are the fuel of choice because they are both available and relatively cheap _meta_end_dot_

 they should be exploited with an eye toward driving the price per barrel down not up that is if you re a fan of seeing the economy continue to do well and not have continually and consistently rising fuel costs impact all costs across the board _meta_end_dot_

 alternative energies aren t ready for prime time _meta_end_dot_

 as the article points out we ve been playing this alternative energy game since the _meta_number_ref_s and jimmy carter s solar gambit and where are we _meta_end_question_

 a very very long time and large investment away from any viable and sizeable energy production from them that s where _meta_end_dot_

 what we shouldn t do as we continue to chase the alternative energy unicorn is make it harder more expensive or more restrictive to exploit the energy resources we do have _meta_end_dot_

 once we have viable and cleaner alternative energy sources perfected and ready to go then it makes perfect sense to begin phasing one technology out as the other is phased in _meta_end_dot_

 that would be a viable energy policy _meta_end_dot_

 that s not what i read this energy bill doing at least as the guardian has presented it _meta_end_dot_

 then there is the latest savior of us all ethanol _meta_end_dot_

 less efficient and just as polluting although in a slightly different way than gasoline _meta_end_dot_

 so we raise the cafe standards and then mandate the use of a less efficient fuel _meta_end_question_

 and that s good policy _meta_end_question_

 no _meta_end_dot_

 it s not _meta_end_dot_

 but it is the policy it seems we re going to be stuck with if congress gets its way _meta_end_dot_

 so grab your wallet and get ready for the tug of war for its contents _meta_end_dot_

 a lot of its contents _meta_end_dot_
