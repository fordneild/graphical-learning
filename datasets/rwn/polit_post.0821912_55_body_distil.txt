  update ok so i demonstrate once again that it might be a good idea to take a gander over here before i post _meta_end_dot_

 stink _meta_end_exclamation_

 sorry people _meta_end_dot_

 while the video is the same the content is not however _meta_end_dot_

 you ve obviously seen the video if you read john s post _meta_end_dot_

 i m removing it and putting a link to the post below so your eyes don t burn out seeing paris naked legs twice _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_beep_ref_ so have you seen the best advertising for john mccain yet _meta_end_question_

 note obviously you have yesterday paris hilton released a video putting forth her energy policy _meta_end_dot_

 she had to cut the video short because she had to pick a vice presidential candidate bitches but hey she makes sense my first thought watching this video was cassy fiano s too scary question if paris and barack were your two choices which would you vote for _meta_end_question_

 i honest to god don t know who would be worse well let s consider what paris has that obama lacks job experience as in she s had a real job paid real taxes and had to make executive decisions owned a company forget pie in the sky ideals she knows what it s like to hire and fire to haggle with lawyers over contracts to negotiate _meta_end_dot_

 world awareness sure it s ibiza and paris and london but barack obama has nothing on paris when it comes to jet setting style obama has the sunglasses nose in the air jacket over the shoulder panache but paris throws in the head toss and minces in a way obama just can t for the camera although i have to give it to him he s pretty damn good _meta_end_dot_

 policy while obama talks one more government bail out paris discusses energy policies that are actually workable and sensible _meta_end_dot_

 youth obama is young and fresh and exciting but paris is even younger and fre well younger _meta_end_dot_

 neither one of them seem particularly fresh _meta_end_dot_

 smoking to stay skinny works for them though _meta_end_dot_

 something for the youth of america to consider _meta_end_dot_
