 blunt statement on obama campaign s abusive use of missouri law enforcement jefferson city gov _meta_end_dot_

 matt blunt today issued the following statement on news reports that have exposed plans by u s _meta_end_dot_

 senator barack obama to use missouri law enforcement to threaten and intimidate his critics _meta_end_dot_

 st _meta_end_dot_

 louis county circuit attorney bob mcculloch st _meta_end_dot_

 louis city circuit attorney jennifer joyce jefferson county sheriff glenn boyer and obama and the leader of his missouri campaign senator claire mccaskill have attached the stench of police state tactics to the obama biden campaign _meta_end_dot_

 what senator obama and his helpers are doing is scandalous beyond words the party that claims to be the party of thomas jefferson is abusing the justice system and offices of public trust to silence political criticism with threats of prosecution and criminal punishment _meta_end_dot_

 this abuse of the law for intimidation insults the most sacred principles and ideals of jefferson _meta_end_dot_

 i can think of nothing more offensive to jefferson s thinking than using the power of the state to deprive americans of their civil rights _meta_end_dot_

 the only conceivable purpose of messrs _meta_end_dot_

 mcculloch obama and the others is to frighten people away from expressing themselves to chill free and open debate to suppress support and donations to conservative organizations targeted by this anti civil rights to strangle criticism of mr _meta_end_dot_

 obama to suppress ads about his support of higher taxes and to choke out criticism on television radio the internet blogs e mail and daily conversation about the election _meta_end_dot_

 barack obama needs to grow up _meta_end_dot_

 leftist blogs and others in the press constantly say false things about me and my family _meta_end_dot_

 usually we ignore false and scurrilous accusations because the purveyors have no credibility _meta_end_dot_

 when necessary we refute them _meta_end_dot_

 enlisting missouri law enforcement to intimidate people and kill free debate is reminiscent of the sedition acts not a free society if this allegation is true barack obama needs to do more than grow up _meta_end_dot_

 governor blunt said explicitly that i can think of nothing more offensive to jefferson s thinking than using the power of the state to deprive americans of their civil rights the u s _meta_end_dot_

 code title _meta_number_ref_ crimes has a specific name for this _meta_end_dot_

 title _meta_number_ref_ part i chapter _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 the going in disguise on the highway part probably refers to two or more night riders in sheets and hoods threatening black people the same constituency whom the anointed one claims to represent with repercussions for voting exercising their right to free speech and so on _meta_end_dot_

 in fact a related section of the u s _meta_end_dot_

 code is known as the ku klux klan act for this exact reason _meta_end_dot_

 in addition title _meta_number_ref_ chapter _meta_number_ref_ subchapter i _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 conspiracy to interfere with civil rights _meta_number_ref_ depriving persons of rights or privilegesif two or more persons in any state or territory conspire or go in disguise on the highway or on the premises of another for the purpose of depriving either directly or indirectly any person or class of persons of the equal protection of the laws or of equal privileges and immunities under the laws or for the purpose of preventing or hindering the constituted authorities of any state or territory from giving or securing to all persons within such state or territory the equal protection of the laws or if two or more persons conspire to prevent by force intimidation or threat any citizen who is lawfully entitled to vote from giving his support or advocacy in a legal manner toward or in favor of the election of any lawfully qualified person as an elector for president or vice president or as a member of congress of the united states or to injure any citizen in person or property on account of such support or advocacy in any case of conspiracy set forth in this section if one or more persons engaged therein do or cause to be done any act in furtherance of the object of such conspiracy whereby another is injured in his person or property or deprived of having and exercising any right or privilege of a citizen of the united states the party so injured or deprived may have an action for the recovery of damages occasioned by such injury or deprivation against any one or more of the conspirators _meta_end_dot_

 governor blunt s press release uses the specific words using the power of the state to deprive americans of their civil rights intimidation and silence political criticism with threats of prosecution and criminal punishment we would like any attorneys who read this to weigh in on whether assuming that governor blunt s allegations are proven this constitutes a violation of the u s _meta_end_dot_

 code as shown above _meta_end_dot_

 meanwhile if these allegations are indeed true then barack obama can be compared legitimately to adolf hitler _meta_end_dot_

 godwin s law applies only when a comparison of a political opponent to hitler or nazis is a gross exaggeration and using the power of the state to deprive americans of their civil rights is exactly what hitler and real nazis once did to germans _meta_end_dot_
