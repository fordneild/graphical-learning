  there are lots of things surrendie loves some good brie french bread a nice bordeaux pre emptive surrender _meta_end_dot_

 one of his others is when a port sider decides to extend their _meta_number_ref_ minutes with some sort of craziness such as with cindy sheehan wes clark and now al gore _meta_end_dot_

 though surrendie is conflicted as he has never really liked al since he smells vaguely of oil and ozone and refuses to share his food former vice president al gore seeking to shake up an energy debate that is focused mostly on drilling challenged the united states to shift its entire electricity sector to carbon free wind solar and geothermal power within _meta_number_ref_ years and use that power to fuel a new fleet of electric vehicles _meta_end_dot_

 the goal is the most ambitious energy plan by a major u s _meta_end_dot_

 political figure and one many energy experts say is unrealistic _meta_end_dot_

 gore insists the only real obstacle is the reluctance of america s leaders to seek bold solutions to high energy prices and global warming _meta_end_dot_

 he likened his challenge to president john f _meta_end_dot_

 kennedy s _meta_number_ref_ call to put a man on the moon _meta_end_dot_

 hey someone pay attention to me _meta_end_exclamation_

 i was the emperor of the moon on futurama after all _meta_end_exclamation_

 this obama guy is a flash in the pan you can read his entire speech over at the doteartblog at the ny times where they probably wet their panties and do not understand that the united states doesn t really have that many areas that can be tapped in to for geothermal power and the return on power for solar and wind is low and requires massive tracts of clear cut land _meta_end_dot_

 they are nice as supplemental but unrealistic for complete _meta_end_dot_

 meanwhile there is a wee bit of a problem regarding al s consensus theory beyond the fact that consensus is not science of course and which mcq covered a bit earlier the american physical society an organization representing nearly _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ physicists has reversed its stance on climate change and is now proclaiming that many of its members disbelieve in human induced global warming _meta_end_dot_

 the aps is also sponsoring public debate on the validity of global warming science _meta_end_dot_

 the leadership of the society had previously called the evidence for global warming incontrovertible uh oh _meta_end_dot_

 there s that word the goracle hates debate _meta_end_dot_

 because damnitall _meta_end_exclamation_

 anthropogenic climate change is real it is killing us and hey have you thought about buying carbon credits from the company where i am on the board of directors _meta_end_question_

 is it any wonder gore decided not to run for president _meta_end_question_

 otherwise well he would have to debate his wild a_meta_beep_ref_ed ideas _meta_end_dot_
