  last night on instant messenger a female friend of mine sent me a link to a new book that jessica valenti over at feministing is coming out with _meta_end_dot_

 yes believe it or not this apparently isn t some sort of off the wall parody it s a real book after sending me the link my friend s comment was what is it with feminists and wanting to turn america s teenagers into raging whores good question _meta_end_dot_

 the best thing i can come up with is that when people do stupid or embarrassing things it makes them feel better to think that other people are doing it with them _meta_end_dot_

 some of us can get past our flaws by simply shrugging our shoulders saying the flesh is weak and admitting that we re not living up to our ideals _meta_end_dot_

 but these hardcore liberal feminists _meta_end_question_

 for them it s not enough to say that i m not a virgin or i like to sleep with a lot of guys they have to come up with some kind of justification for why it s the best way to live _meta_end_dot_

 that s not a prelude to a long preachy rant it s just basic common sense when we re talking about whether we should be encouraging virginity _meta_end_dot_

 and does america really have an obsession with virginity anyway _meta_end_question_

 since when _meta_end_question_

 i interviewed dawn eden about her book the thrill of the chaste and it was fascinating to me that she had been doing interviews all over the place for months and months off that book _meta_end_dot_

 that s not even virginity it s chastity and it s apparently so rare that it kept her in bookings for more than a year _meta_end_dot_

 even setting that aside is virginity some sort of huge problem especially with young women _meta_end_question_

 take a look at these stats from an article that was at msnbc back in march in the first study of its kind researchers at the federal centers for disease control and prevention found at least one in _meta_number_ref_ teenage american girls has a sexually transmitted disease _meta_end_dot_

 the most common one is a virus that can cause cervical cancer and the second most common can cause infertility _meta_end_dot_

 nearly half the black teens in the study had at least one sexually transmitted infection versus _meta_number_ref_ percent among both whites and mexican american teens _meta_end_dot_

 a quarter of teenage american girls have stds but wow watch out for that virginity and we didn t even get to out of wedlock pregnancy yet _meta_end_exclamation_

 if you want to know why liberals and conservatives don t get along books like this tell you all you need to know _meta_end_dot_

 point out just about anything good decent or helpful for the country and there will be liberals coming out of the woodwork to corrupt it pervert it or tear it down and all the while they ll have a smug sanctimonious attitude about the almost unbelievable life wrecking stupidity that they re advocating _meta_end_dot_
