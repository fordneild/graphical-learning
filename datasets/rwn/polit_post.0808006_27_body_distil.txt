  the wicked witch of new york is doing the groundwork to make sure that she gets the delegates she earned from her victory in michigan democrat hillary clinton pressed on wednesday for a new vote in michigan that could be crucial to her aspirations in the tight battle with barack obama to be the party s presidential nominee in november _meta_end_dot_

 i am here for one simple reason to make sure michigan s votes are counted and your voices are heard in this election the new york senator said in a hastily arranged visit to the state _meta_end_dot_

 clinton urged rival obama a senator from illinois to give his backing to a proposal that would allow the state to hold a new democratic contest in michigan _meta_end_dot_

 senator obama speaks passionately on the campaign trail about empowering the american people _meta_end_dot_

 today i am urging him to match those words with actions she said _meta_end_dot_

 we need to either count the votes that have already been cast in michigan and florida or have new full and fair elections so that we can have your voices and your votes counted she said to applause _meta_end_dot_

 michigan democratic party leaders said on tuesday a proposal to hold additional primary voting in june was stalled and unlikely to be approved before a deadline this week _meta_end_dot_

 opposition from lawmakers backing obama s campaign seemed certain to scuttle any proposal _meta_end_dot_

 it is extremely unlikely that there is going to be another vote in michigan so why is hillary doing this _meta_end_question_

 simple even though there was no real race in the state obama wasn t even on the ballot hillary did win and she wants the delegates _meta_end_dot_

 now should she get them _meta_end_question_

 no way _meta_end_dot_

 it was against the rules for michigan to move their primary up _meta_end_dot_

 they knew that _meta_end_dot_

 they did it anyway _meta_end_dot_

 the democratic party told them up front that if they held the primary their delegates wouldn t be counted _meta_end_dot_

 in fact obama and john edwards because they listened to the dnc didn t even bother to put their names on the ballots _meta_end_dot_

 so it would be incredibly unfair to seat michigan s delegates _meta_end_dot_

 however this is where the democrats have screwed themselves with the silly rhetoric they ve used against republicans _meta_end_dot_

 from _meta_number_ref_ on the democratic mantra has been every vote must be counted cough cough unless we re talking a vote from a soldier who is probably one of those _meta_beep_ref_ conservatives who will vote for a republican but what if the votes are fraudulent _meta_end_question_

 count them anyway _meta_end_exclamation_

 but what if we aren t sure whom the person was voting for _meta_end_question_

 guess and count them anyway _meta_end_dot_

 but the rules say that these votes aren t supposed to count _meta_end_exclamation_

 screw the rules and count the votes already _meta_end_exclamation_

 that s exactly the attitude the democrats have had for the last few years and guess what _meta_end_question_

 if they really believe their own rhetoric florida and michigan will get their delegates counted _meta_end_dot_

 is that fair _meta_end_question_

 no way _meta_end_dot_

 should it be done _meta_end_question_

 absolutely not _meta_end_dot_

 but would counting those delegates be completely consistent with what the democrats have been saying for years now _meta_end_question_

 yes it would _meta_end_dot_

 that along with threats that the democrats could lose michigan and florida in the general election over this issue may end up giving hillary just enough momentum to collect delegates from both of those states before it s all over _meta_end_dot_
