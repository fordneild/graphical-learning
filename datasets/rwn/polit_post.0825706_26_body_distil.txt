  crossposted from stop the aclu much has been discussed about john mccain not being able to use a computer and in an ad from the barack obama campaign shown above it says can t send an email referencing mccain _meta_end_dot_

 an article in boston com from _meta_number_ref_ shows mccain cannot type on a keyboard _meta_end_dot_

 it took a blogger from the corner less than a day to find an article in boston com that references john mccain injuries from vietnam showing he cannot tie his shoes comb his hair properly or typing on a keyboard stating it was because of his severe war injuries which limit his ability to do certain things with his hands _meta_end_dot_

 mccain gets emotional at the mention of military families needing food stamps or veterans lacking health care _meta_end_dot_

 the outrage comes from inside mccain s severe war injuries prevent him from combing his hair typing on a keyboard or tying his shoes _meta_end_dot_

 friends marvel at mccain s encyclopedic knowledge of sports _meta_end_dot_

 he s an avid fan ted williams is his hero but he can t raise his arm above his shoulder to throw a baseball _meta_end_dot_

 one has to wonder if anyone at the obama campaign knows how to use a search engine _meta_end_dot_

 this new ad is part of the aggressive campaigning the obama officials say they will be rolling out and as abc s political punch points out this is the thrid or fourth time barack obama will be taking the gloves off to fight it out _meta_end_dot_

 david plouffe who is obama s campaign manager says they are heading into the final stretch and continues on to say we will respond with speed and ferocity to john mccain s attacks and we will take the fight to him but we will do it on the big issues that matter to the american people _meta_end_dot_

 we will not allow john mccain and his band of karl rove disciples to make this big election about small things if mocking john mccain s disabilities that he obtained during his captivity in war is how they plan to fight the big issues then obama s campaign has more problems than just sagging poll numbers _meta_end_dot_

 perhaps some lesson on how to use a google search engine should be in order for the obama campaign members responsible for creating these latest types of ads _meta_end_dot_
