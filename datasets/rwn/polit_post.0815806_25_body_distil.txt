  pathetic hags with nothing to aspire to other than being attractive having pretty clothes and having sex dawn eden on sex and the city sex and the city was the ultimate chick flick tv series and like most men i spent years avoiding it like a prostate exam _meta_end_dot_

 however after discussing the show with the incomparable dawn eden when i interviewed her about her surprisingly deep and spiritual book the thrill of the chaste i decided to take the plunge and actually watch a season of the show _meta_end_dot_

 surprisingly i actually enjoyed watching sex and the city so much that i cycled through three seasons in roughly two months time _meta_end_dot_

 why was the show alluring _meta_end_question_

 well it featured four attractive single women in their mid thirties getting into funny situations that revolved around dating and sex and then talking about them without men around _meta_end_dot_

 for a single man in his thirties it was almost like watching tapes that had been sneaked across enemy lines _meta_end_dot_

 moreover the characters while not necessarily sympathetic were at least intriguing _meta_end_dot_

 there s miranda a feisty slightly neurotic lawyer who s frustrated with men _meta_end_dot_

 she was the only character who would occasionally go an entire episode without having a man in her bed _meta_end_dot_

 next is samantha a walking talking female libido who has very little to her personality beyond being generally assertive and sleeping with just about any good looking man she can coax into her bed _meta_end_dot_

 then there s charlotte the nice commitment oriented more conservative woman who s totally focused on getting married _meta_end_dot_

 she is a very likable character in some ways but almost as unrealistic as samantha when looked at as a whole _meta_end_dot_

 how do you take a character seriously when she s supposed to be a good girl who actually gets horribly offended when her own friends drop f bombs in her presence but meanwhile she ended up sleeping with almost as many different guys as samantha did during the first three seasons _meta_end_question_

 and last but not least there s carrie bradshaw who s supposed to represent the every woman watching the show _meta_end_dot_

 of course the fact that the character people are supposed to be able to best relate to is a woman who writes a column about sex for the local paper is obsessed with high fashion and spends her time frantically alternating between meaningless flings and long term relationships tells you a lot about the show _meta_end_dot_

 does that mean that sex and the city promotes a promiscuous unhealthy lifestyle _meta_end_question_

 yes it does although to be fair the show does occasionally show the consequences of sleeping around _meta_end_dot_

 for example one of my favorite moments in the first three seasons is when samantha gets sick knocks a curtain rod down and needs help getting it back up _meta_end_dot_

 so she starts calling all the different one night stands she has been with and even though she goes through an enormous number of them not one of them cares enough about her to come over and help _meta_end_dot_

 unfortunately such moments happened far too seldom on the show and were so sanitized that as a conservative you almost want to cheer when one of the women actually has to deal with a consequence of sleeping with a different guy every week _meta_end_dot_

 which brings me to the movie _meta_end_dot_

 much to my chagrin charlotte and miranda were married when the movie started and samantha and carrie were in long term relationships _meta_end_dot_

 this was horrifying because the dating stories were the heart of the series for the first three seasons _meta_end_dot_

 it was almost like watching an a team movie where the guys had given up helping people and spend the whole movie playing monopoly and checkers _meta_end_dot_

 so if there were no dating stories what was going on _meta_end_question_

 lots of brutally painful relationship stories along with talk about fashion _meta_end_dot_

 in other words it was guy hell _meta_end_dot_

 we could put that movie on constant rotation at gitmo and within a couple of days the terrorists there would be begging to be waterboarded just to get away from their tv screens _meta_end_dot_

 later that night after calling some female friends who were big fans of the show i found out that it got much more relationship oriented in the later seasons _meta_end_dot_

 had i only known i would have just written column _meta_number_ref_ on barack obama instead of spending more than two hours of my life in that prada nightmare _meta_end_dot_

 if you want a quick review of the movie it s easy to give you one in less than five words _meta_end_dot_

 for women it s relationship stuff _meta_end_dot_

 you ll love it and for men it s just run beyond that two things really stuck out for me about the movie _meta_end_dot_

 the other unintentionally sad but telling moment requires a mini spoiler so consider yourself forewarned if you continue _meta_end_dot_
