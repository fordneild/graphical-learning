  it would be a good start _meta_end_dot_

 i ve been noticing that gas price duality among the liberati for years now and of course it s always made perfect sense to me _meta_end_dot_

 that s why i could hear npr do a piece about the evils of high gas prices in the morning and that afternoon report that our gas prices are very low by the standards of other developed countries _meta_end_dot_

 there s no contradiction really my lefty friends want to make things hard for the working class at the same time that they want to delude themselves that they really want to make things easier _meta_end_dot_

 give with one hand take with the other _meta_end_dot_

 i still think we need flex fuel vehicles as robert zubrin insists in energy victory and an eventual transition to alcohol fuels such as ethanol and methanol _meta_end_dot_

 we certainly need to end the tariffs that keep sugar cane ethanol out of this country and we must obliterate the ban on the use of shale oil products in the u s _meta_end_dot_

 military _meta_end_dot_

 but we also need to keep the oil flowing preferably from non opec sources _meta_end_dot_

 like um let s see _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 how about the united states _meta_end_question_

 that s one of my favorite non opec oil producing countries _meta_end_dot_

 i like canada too _meta_end_dot_

 and mexico s cool _meta_end_dot_

 also the less we schlep our petro products around the smaller our carbon footprint _meta_end_dot_

 let s tread lightly on the earth _meta_end_dot_

 drilling the ocs is only the beginning we also must make better use of our own shale oil _meta_end_dot_

 and contra senator mccain we must drill in anwr _meta_end_dot_

 as alaska s governer sarah palin is fond of pointing out the footprint of the proposed facility is the size of a metropolitan airport in the vastness that is anwr you d be hard pressed to even find it if you didn t know where to look or unless you had an ugly meter on you that is some hard core ugly terrain _meta_end_dot_

 so yes please keep the pressure on _meta_end_dot_

 drill that outer continental shelf _meta_end_dot_

 but let s press on here just a handful of common sense actions can bring us the energy independence we so desperately need and bring us relief at the pump _meta_end_dot_
