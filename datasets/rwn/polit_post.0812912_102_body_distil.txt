  over at the huffpo jeffrey feldman is actually accusing rush limbaugh of trying to incite violence with operation chaos for weeks now rush limbaugh has been trying to incite political violence by giving on air military sounding orders effectively commanding his listeners to wage war against the u s _meta_end_dot_

 electoral system _meta_end_dot_

 the right wing pundit s orders to his republican listeners have been clear vote in the democratic primaries as a coordinated tactic for sewing division in the opposition party _meta_end_dot_

 the goal of such chaos limbaugh has stated explicitly is to foment hatred between different parts of the democratic party leading ultimately to street riots during the denver convention _meta_end_dot_

 most americans would agree that using radio to incite political violence is not only wrong but the attempt itself represents a massive failure in our democracy _meta_end_dot_

 how limbaugh s broadcasts differ from say radio broadcasts that incited violence in rwanda and kenya for example can help us to understand exactly what limbaugh was doing and the exact danger it poses _meta_end_dot_

 the violence in limbaugh s broadcasts in other words is not just the attempt to incite riots but also a way of defining the left as destructive murderers of children as a violent threat to the american people _meta_end_dot_

 in rwanda the radio broadcasts did not just invoke hutu to kill tutsi s but did so by claiming falsely that tutsi s had killed large numbers of hutu and that therefore hutu must form self defense groups to prevent tutsi from killing again _meta_end_dot_

 defining tutsi as murderers in other words was a crucial part of violent hutu broadcasts that led to the genocide of tutsi _meta_end_dot_

 so encouraging republicans to vote with an eye towards extending the democratic primary is the equivalent of hutus encouraging other hutus to go into the street and butcher tutsis with machetes _meta_end_dot_

 that s an intriguing argument especially given the sort of regular arguments that are made by liberals in these days and times _meta_end_dot_

 if you read liberal blogs and forums you will regularly come across posts accusing conservatives of being nazis _meta_end_dot_

 accusing bush of going to war just to enrich his oil buddies _meta_end_dot_

 accusing conservatives of wanting to round up liberals and put them in camps _meta_end_dot_

 accusing bush of being behind _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 now ask yourself would it be morally wrong to kill someone who s worse than hitler how about killing the person behind the wtc attacks osama bin laden _meta_end_question_

 would you be morally ok with putting a gun to his head and shooting him _meta_end_question_

 what if someone were going to round you up and take you to a death camp based on your political beliefs _meta_end_question_

 would it be immoral to murder him _meta_end_question_

 point being standard liberal rhetoric that you hear every day would logically lead towards violence if they believed their own bs _meta_end_dot_

 so for feldman to make this convoluted argument that limbaugh is actually encouraging violence by encouraging conservatives to help keep the democratic race going is amazingly hypocritical when you have liberals declaring that bush is behind _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ and worse than hitler every day _meta_end_dot_
