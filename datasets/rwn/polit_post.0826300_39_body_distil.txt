  t he things you can find offered as serious journalism _meta_end_dot_

 perhaps the most insidious byproduct of the attacks of sept _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ has been a reflexive sanctification of the military _meta_end_dot_

 to put this in bumper stickerese support the troops _meta_end_dot_

 well i have an ugly confession to make i don t support the troops at least not unconditionally _meta_end_dot_

 when somebody tells me they serve in the military my first impulse isn t to say thank you for your service like those insufferable chickenhawks on talk radio _meta_end_dot_

 my first impulse is to say i m sorry to hear that because i am _meta_end_dot_

 i m sorry to know that the person i m talking to might someday be maimed or killed on the job or might someday kill someone else _meta_end_dot_

 or refuel a plane that drops bombs on buildings _meta_end_dot_

 i can t see how anyone who calls himself or herself christian or human for that matter wouldn t be sorry _meta_end_dot_

 the fact that we have an army that we need an army is inherently tragic _meta_end_dot_

 it s an admission that our species is still ruled by fear and aggression _meta_end_dot_

 almond characterizes those who support the troops with a slogan _meta_end_dot_

 his intent is to point out at least in his opinion how unthinking and knee jerk such a position is _meta_end_dot_

 he then manages to quickly write himself into the same corner _meta_end_dot_

 in his case the bumper stickereese is war is never the answer both notions unconditional support of the troops and war is never the answer are naive and unthinking extremist positions _meta_end_dot_

 almond asserts that there are those out there on one extreme like the evil chickenhawks who unconditionally support the troops _meta_end_dot_

 ironically almond them proves there are extremists on the other side who believe war is never the answer _meta_end_dot_

 that would be him _meta_end_dot_

 all of that was simply a preface to allow him to present in all it s splendor sarcasm a boilerplate rant against the military industrial complex and war profiteers _meta_end_dot_

 i assume although i can t understand why the boston globe pays him for this tripe _meta_end_dot_

 ain t life grand _meta_end_question_
