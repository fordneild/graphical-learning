  abc news reports that former president jimmy carter will not be endorsing any democratic candidate soon _meta_end_dot_

 the only thing i know is that i have not made an endorsement and don t intend to until the time of the convention said america s most contemptible living former president _meta_end_dot_

 the charming thing is that this news story seems to have been written without any sense of irony whatsoever _meta_end_dot_

 carter is not only a vacuous and egocentric moral pygmy _meta_end_dot_

 he also has no national political influence or credibility _meta_end_dot_

 to the contrary he is an ongoing embarrassment to democrats and he and the clintons whom you would think would be natural allies had avoided each other since forever _meta_end_dot_

 carter s endorsement which seems likely to go to obama can hardly be sought by any legitimate democratic candidate except to the extent that any _meta_number_ref_ year old boy seeks to be kissed by his mustachioed aunt _meta_end_dot_

 so is jimmy at least being a decently loyal democrat and avoiding tarring either candidate with the brush of association with his wretched self until it hardly matters _meta_end_question_

 or is he merely trying to gin up some ongoing media interest by spinning a thread of such unbearable suspense _meta_end_question_

 given his self regard the latter seems more likely _meta_end_dot_

 and in typical carter fashion even more pathetic _meta_end_dot_

 cross posted on likelihood of success _meta_end_dot_
