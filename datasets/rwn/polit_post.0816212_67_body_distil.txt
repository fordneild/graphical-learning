  so after years of a sexless marriage a wife provided a novel solution and later wrote about it charla apparently had no intention of writing about the gift as she euphemistically refers to it _meta_end_dot_

 she was simply a homemaker and marketing consultant who in _meta_number_ref_ wanted to give her husband a special _meta_number_ref_th birthday present _meta_end_dot_

 this is something no one else would give him she said in an interview _meta_end_dot_

 it didn t cost a lot of money _meta_end_dot_

 it was highly memorable _meta_end_dot_

 it met all the criteria for a really great gift brad was less than fully enthusiastic mostly because he says his wife often has big ideas and poor follow through _meta_end_dot_

 after all she hadn t been especially generous in that department since they d had their two children _meta_end_dot_

 he paid closer attention when he realized that she was serious _meta_end_dot_

 the couples did hit the wall at some point _meta_end_dot_

 and when it was over did they continue their marathon ways _meta_end_question_

 not exactly today the browns report they have sex approximately six times a month or double their frequency before their adventure _meta_end_dot_

 the mullers decline to discuss their habits except to say that they fall well within the national average _meta_end_dot_

 and brad said the sex is better _meta_end_dot_

 it made it much easier to be open to the idea more spontaneous he said so you don t go back to that always gaming for it and always trying to get out of it married couples know that sexual needs don t always get met but it seems that it s also possible to have too much of a good thing _meta_end_dot_

 so that makes me wonder what is the ideal for the average coupled person _meta_end_question_

 the ideal rate of conjugal relations is every day five times a week three times a week twice a week once a week once every other week once a month quarterly annually pollcode com free polls cross posted at dr _meta_end_dot_
