  oh boy some dude over at kim s place is bitching because he has to get a permit to put in a pool in his yard and no blankety blank government should interfere with what is happening on his property _meta_end_dot_

 well it s an interesting argument _meta_end_dot_

 houston is rather notorious for it s lack of building codes _meta_end_dot_

 in fact buying homes outside of certain communities can put a person in a precarious living situation _meta_end_dot_

 the downside is possible death by burning due to faulty wiring foundation shifting and building collapse or drowning due to flooding _meta_end_dot_

 well that last one is less likely because there are no basements _meta_end_dot_

 most likely everything and everyone will just get really wet _meta_end_dot_

 i live in a planned community where there are codes and rules _meta_end_dot_

 out of state friends have snorted in derision at my snobbiness and then i point out that i know people who live in the country and down the street from their lovely five acres a land fill is going in _meta_end_dot_

 nice _meta_end_dot_

 oh and next door their neighbors have their toilet plumbed to a hole in the ground _meta_end_dot_

 that tends to knock the edges off a person s home value _meta_end_dot_

 on the upside housing in houston is cheaper and houston is not suffering the disastrous loss in home values that other places are experiencing _meta_end_dot_

 in heavily restricted states and cities like in new york for example it could be argued that the tight codes have contributed to inflated home prices _meta_end_dot_

 this article is from _meta_number_ref_ but the principles still hold another recent report examined why prices are so high _meta_end_dot_

 conducted by new york university for the city and the new york city partnership it found that because of corruption outdated regulations and higher labor and material costs residential construction in the five boroughs is the most expensive in america _meta_end_dot_

 those hurdles stop many projects further squeezing the market and driving up prices _meta_end_dot_

 this study said the city can spur housing development by revising building codes and zoning regulations and by freeing up more city owned land _meta_end_dot_

 the city also could waive or reduce permit fees for new projects and revise the tax structure so vacant land is taxed at a higher rate while providing breaks for new multifamily housing _meta_end_dot_

 somewhere between safety and responsibility to the next owner and freedom to what you damn well please there s a balance _meta_end_dot_
