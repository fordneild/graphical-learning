  real education kindly agreed to an interview with me to discuss his new book _meta_end_dot_

 you may know him as a coauthor of the bestselling the bell curve or from his hit losing ground a book that changed the national conversation about welfare _meta_end_dot_

 you may also recognize his name or some of his ideas about education reform from the wall street journal _meta_end_dot_

 whether you re familiar with him or not i think you ll enjoy what he has to say _meta_end_dot_

 please also check out his new book published just last month by random house _meta_end_dot_

 katie favazza it seems your book has a broader audience than simply parents of school age children _meta_end_dot_

 who should read this book _meta_end_question_

 charles murray parents are the first audience without question _meta_end_dot_

 but i hope the book also provides an opening wedge that makes it easier for teachers to state their case _meta_end_dot_

 i got a lot of reaction from teachers in k _meta_number_ref_ and college when i first published some of these themes in the wall street journal almost all of them being of the thank god someone is finally saying out loud what we see in our classrooms variety _meta_end_dot_

 once the conversation has been opened up we might see a lot more teachers speaking out publicly _meta_end_dot_

 just last month the atlantic published a wonderful article by a professor x who teaches at a college of last resort _meta_end_dot_

 he still felt he had to remain anonymous but at least he got his experience into print _meta_end_dot_

 and don t underestimate the degree to which students will respond to the book _meta_end_dot_

 i ve heard from a number of students telling me about the pressure they were under to go to college when they already knew that college wasn t right for them _meta_end_dot_

 i guess the audience for the book includes everyone but politicians and school administrators _meta_end_dot_

 they re pretty much beyond hope _meta_end_dot_

 katie favazza your ideas about tailoring education to suit different abilities seem so basic at first but are truly revolutionary in their nature _meta_end_dot_

 when you were in school what were your strongest abilities and how did they or did they not shape your own educational path _meta_end_question_

 charles murray i grew up in a small town and i was a bright kid regarding verbal skills anyway nothing special in mathematics who had all sorts of intellectual interests that none of my friends shared _meta_end_dot_

 maybe you should strike bright and replace it with weird how many seventh graders get interested in mountain climbing in iowa and send away to switzerland for a climbing guide in german for the north wall of the eiger then try to translate it using a german english dictionary _meta_end_question_

 truly weird _meta_end_dot_

 i yearned from eighth grade onward to go to harvard my image of the great world and i always knew that once i got there i would major in history _meta_end_dot_

 i knew what my strengths were from very early on though i probably thought i was smarter in math than i really was and my educational path was pretty straightforward _meta_end_dot_

 katie favazza one of your books truths is that half of the children in schools are below average and you go on to say that schools have no choice but to leave some of these children behind _meta_end_dot_

 when should educators say enough is enough must an educator simply walk away _meta_end_question_

 charles murray educators never need to walk away _meta_end_dot_

 let s rephrase that last sentence to read when must a teacher realize he s done all he can do and guide the student in another direction i think you need a concatenation of three perspectives on a child _meta_end_dot_

 one is a thorough technical assessment that occurs early in a child s education and is periodically updated thereafter not just a test for math or reading aptitude but including personality measures and test batteries that will reveal learning disabilities _meta_end_dot_

 the second is the record in the classroom in the form of grades and scores on examinations _meta_end_dot_

 the third is the teacher s observation of the child in class the three dimensional picture that integrates the technical information from the first two perspectives with the flesh and blood reality of how the child copes in the classroom _meta_end_dot_

 say for example we have a student who can t seem to get the hang of algebra i _meta_end_dot_

 when all three of the perspectives correspond it s time for a teacher to think in terms of a future for that child that does not include algebra ii _meta_end_dot_

 katie favazza you assert that too many students are going to college today _meta_end_dot_

 what damage do you think this does to american society _meta_end_question_

 why does america need the forgotten half as you call them _meta_end_question_

 charles murray i m less concerned about the damage to society than i am with damage to the kids who don t belong in college _meta_end_dot_

 high school students are indoctrinated with the pernicious idea that jobs are divided into two bins good jobs that require a college degree and bad jobs that don t _meta_end_dot_

 so you end up with students whose counselors encourage them to go to college regardless of their abilities who have never been told about the myriad technical and crafts jobs that are challenging fun and pay well _meta_end_dot_

 so they try to go to college fail and too often seem to think that their only alternative is being a checkout clerk at wal mart _meta_end_dot_

 as for why we need the forgotten half i would find it a whole lot easier to live in a society with a tenth as many lawyers and professors than to live in a society with a tenth as many plumbers _meta_end_dot_

 i am at war with the whole concept of occupational prestige _meta_end_dot_

 it exists and i can t see any way to get rid of it but it is senseless _meta_end_dot_

 katie favazza what are the best ways to push the academically gifted to prepare them to run the country _meta_end_question_

 charles murray the academically gifted which i define a lot more loosely than others as the top _meta_number_ref_ percent in academic ability almost all go to college _meta_end_dot_

 they need to have their feet held to the fire _meta_end_dot_

 they need to have term papers graded by professors who automatically cut the grade for grammatical errors and who demand precise logic and coherent prose _meta_end_dot_

 they need to acquire the tools for forming accurate judgments which means among other things lots of history because santayana was right about those who are ignorant of history and a thorough grounding in probability because there is hardly any difficult issue in public policy or for that matter in the governance of a corporation that does not involve probabilistic alternatives _meta_end_dot_

 and they need to get a thorough grounding in the great issues of ethics and what it means to live a good life and by that i don t mean a one semester course in philosophy _meta_end_dot_

 i mean the many courses that call upon the best that human beings have produced on these issues in philosophy literature and the arts _meta_end_dot_

 and finally the brightest of the brightest need to learn that they aren t as smart as they think they are _meta_end_dot_

 they need to know what it feels like to be unable to do some intellectual task _meta_end_dot_

 they need to learn intellectual humility the hard way _meta_end_dot_

 katie favazza how do government mandates harm america s young students in general _meta_end_question_

 what has been the single greatest failing of no child left behind in particular _meta_end_question_

 charles murray don t get me started on no child left behind the first time in history i believe that a government passed a law saying that all the children must be above average _meta_end_dot_

 i mean that literally _meta_end_dot_

 the standards of proficient that all children are to meet by _meta_number_ref_ require test scores on math and reading that only those in the top thirty odd percentiles meet _meta_end_dot_

 all children in _meta_number_ref_ are to be where the _meta_number_ref_th percenticle was when the law was passed _meta_end_dot_

 it s an idiotic goal that refuses to accept that many children just aren t smart enough to become proficient in reading and math _meta_end_dot_

 nclb has demoralized teachers who want to teach not teach to a test _meta_end_dot_

 it has focused resources on those who are on the cusp of passing the dreaded test that is used to assess adequate yearly progress ignoring those who don t have a prayer of passing and those who would pass it anyway _meta_end_dot_

 it has induced school systems to engage in all sorts of chicanery to try to meet the law s requirements _meta_end_dot_

 i do not make these comments just on the basis of the technical literature _meta_end_dot_

 my wife and i had children in school during nlcb s first years and saw what it did to our local schools _meta_end_dot_

 katie favazza why is a clear understanding of virtue and happiness necessary for a complete education charles murray if there s one topic that just almost every _meta_number_ref_ year old thinks about it is the meaning of life _meta_end_dot_

 no longer a child not yet an adult with a strong sense of setting out on a long journey through life _meta_number_ref_ year olds are trying to figure out what kind of people they want to be involving issues of virtue what they want to make of themselves involving issues of the meaning of happiness _meta_end_dot_

 but as matters stand students who do not have a well articulated religious faith tend to assume that they have to think through these questions de novo or maybe in bull sessions with their friends _meta_end_dot_

 in fact of course human beings have been thinking through these issues for thousands of years and some humans have created works that speak to those issues brilliantly _meta_end_dot_

 college is the one institution in a position to provide this rich nourishment on such central issues to young people _meta_end_dot_

 that colleges no longer do that is one of the most damning indictments of today s colleges _meta_end_dot_
