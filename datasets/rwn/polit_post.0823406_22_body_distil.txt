  i hate to admit it but cindy mccain appears to have been caught telling an embarrassing untruth about how she came to adopt her daughter _meta_end_dot_

 originally she was claiming that mother theresa personally convinced her to adopt her daughter bridget _meta_end_dot_

 here s the actual text from mccain s website this has now been scrubbed as an advocate for children s health care needs cindy founded and ran the american voluntary medical team avmt from _meta_number_ref_ to _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 avmt provided emergency medical and surgical care to impoverished children throughout the world _meta_end_dot_

 cindy led _meta_number_ref_ medical missions to third world and war torn countries during avmt s seven years of existence _meta_end_dot_

 on one of those missions mother teresa convinced cindy to take two babies in need of medical attention to the united states _meta_end_dot_

 one of those babies is now their adopted daughter _meta_number_ref_ year old bridget mccain _meta_end_dot_

 this story has been told not just by cindy but apparently by john mccain as well mccain talked in glowing terms of his wife cindy _meta_end_dot_

 her right arm is in a sling these days the result of a mishap on the campaign trail in which an over enthusiastic supporter squeezed her arm a little too hard and sprained it _meta_end_dot_

 he also talked of _meta_number_ref_ years ago when cindy was on a humanitarian trip and mother theresa came up to them with two _meta_number_ref_ month old girls _meta_end_dot_

 mother theresa told cindy if they didn t take one of these babies home she would die _meta_end_dot_

 so cindy did telling her husband when she returned i d like to introduce you to your new daughter although bridget was adopted from mother theresa s orphanage it turns out that cindy mccain didn t actually meet mother theresa the mccain campaign had also put out the story that mother teresa convinced cindy to bring home two orphans from bangladesh in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 mrs _meta_end_dot_

 mccain it turns out never met mother teresa on that trip _meta_end_dot_

 once contacted by the monitor the campaign revised the story on its website did cindy mccain talk to mother theresa at all even on the phone _meta_end_question_

 that s unknown but judging by language on the current version of the mccain website it seems unlikely as an advocate for children s health care needs cindy founded and ran the american voluntary medical team avmt from _meta_number_ref_ to _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 avmt provided emergency medical and surgical care to impoverished children throughout the world _meta_end_dot_

 cindy led _meta_number_ref_ medical missions to third world and war torn countries during avmt s seven years of existence _meta_end_dot_

 on one of those missions to mother teresa s orphanage cindy was convinced to take two babies in need of medical attention to the united states _meta_end_dot_

 one of those babies is now their adopted daughter _meta_number_ref_ year old bridget mccain _meta_end_dot_

 this is disappointing not just because it s apparently untrue that cindy mccain spoke to mother theresa but because it makes you scratch your head _meta_end_dot_

 the mccains adopted a little girl from overseas _meta_end_dot_

 that s an amazing incredibly compassionate thing to do _meta_end_dot_

 why embellish a story like that _meta_end_question_

 granted fish stories aren t necessarily unusual _meta_end_dot_

 people will add a little detail here or there to make a story better but it doesn t look good when a politician does it and since john mccain has repeated the story it looks like mr _meta_end_dot_

 straight talk is going to end up having to explain on the campaign trail why he and his wife fudged a story about something as intimate as the circumstances under which they came to adopt their own daughter _meta_end_dot_

 they should know better than that _meta_end_dot_
