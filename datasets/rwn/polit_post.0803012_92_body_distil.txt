  there is this unspoken assumption among a lot of republicans that maybe a defeat in november might not be such a bad thing and the right thing to do is go down with the ship and then we can return to the true reagan principles and the party will be stronger for it _meta_end_dot_

 well if we lose in november when this ship goes down it s going to be a big vortex in the sea _meta_end_dot_

 we face the possibility of having a strong democratic president an increased majority for the democrats in both houses of congress _meta_end_dot_

 the way will be open for a new burst of governmental activism which we have not seen before _meta_end_dot_

 bill clinton tried it in _meta_number_ref_ and he failed _meta_end_dot_

 jimmy carter s plans blew up on the launch pad _meta_end_dot_

 the last time we ve seen a successfully burst of democratic activism was _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 we are in real danger of seeing a similar thing again and it will be pretty negative for the future of the country _meta_end_dot_

 that s one possibility _meta_end_dot_

 another is when you lose in this way you can often lose for a very long time _meta_end_dot_

 parties that lose often react not by adapting but by retreating to their core principles and becoming even more of a minority party than ever _meta_end_dot_

 we can all see how that happened with the democrats _meta_end_dot_

 after the defeat of _meta_number_ref_ how do they respond _meta_end_question_

 they revert to their old new deal roots in _meta_number_ref_ and offer walter mondale saying everything that roosevelt and truman didn t do i ll do they got beat worse in _meta_number_ref_ than they got beat in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 then they got beat in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 even in _meta_number_ref_ they were only back up to _meta_number_ref_ percent of the vote _meta_end_dot_

 if you get on to a bad path in politics you can be out for a long time _meta_end_dot_

 when is the republican congressional majority going to return _meta_end_question_

 it s not something where you say well we ll lose and then we ll recover it s hard to recover in american politics david frum
