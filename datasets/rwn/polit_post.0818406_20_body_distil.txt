 researchers in australia have found that patients with parkinson s disease respond positively to the injection of adult stem cells the griffith university study published in the journal stem cells found that adult stem cells harvested from the noses of parkinson s patients gave rise to dopamine producing brain cells when transplanted into the brain of a rat _meta_end_dot_

 it s also important to note that they have tried the same experiment with embryonic stem cells only it resulted in the formation of tumours or teratomas in the host rats two canadians suffering from a rare form of lung disease were treated with their own gene modified stem cells in an experimental procedure these enhanced stem cells are given in a heart catheterization suite and lodge in the lung where it is hoped they will stimulate the repair and regeneration of blood vessels in the lung explained dr _meta_end_dot_
