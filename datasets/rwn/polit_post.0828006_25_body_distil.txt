  i just watched this opening from the movie idiocracy and it seemed frighteningly plausible _meta_end_dot_

 be forewarned there s some bad language in this but take a look at it and think about the demographic trends in the world today _meta_end_dot_

 it s like the peter principle applied to the human race _meta_end_dot_
