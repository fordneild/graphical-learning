  barack obama was alone in the playground playing with some blocks _meta_end_dot_

 now that that mean lady is gone i m gonna be pesident he said to himself _meta_end_dot_

 mahmoud ahmadinejad slowly crept near him _meta_end_dot_

 hello little barry obama waved at him enthusiastically _meta_end_dot_

 hi _meta_end_exclamation_

 i m barack obama and i ve been in the senate he held up three fingers _meta_end_dot_

 this many years and now i m gonna be pesident i heard mahmoud sat down next to him _meta_end_dot_

 so what are you up to obama stacked some more blocks _meta_end_dot_

 i m building a prison for all the mean people who don t want to pay for universal healthcare and own guns it looks nice _meta_end_dot_

 anyway i think we should go somewhere and talk mahmoud pointed to his van parked next the playground _meta_end_dot_

 obama suddenly became cautious _meta_end_dot_

 my campaign manager said i m not supposed to talk to dictators that s crazy mahmoud said _meta_end_dot_

 i m the democratically elected president of iran _meta_end_dot_

 shouldn t you be able to talk to a leader of a country like me obama was hesitant _meta_end_dot_

 i dunno and we both want american out of iraq _meta_end_dot_

 i just work towards that end more actively _meta_end_dot_

 shouldn t we talk so we can better combine our energies to achieve a goal we both want maybe _meta_end_dot_

 but my campaign manager told me and i lost my puppy and need your help finding him mahmoud told him _meta_end_dot_

 your puppy _meta_end_exclamation_

 oh no _meta_end_exclamation_

 where did you lose him israel took him mahmoud narrowed his eyes _meta_end_dot_

 i will wipe them off the map obama was cautious again _meta_end_dot_

 i really think i m supposed to stay here but i have candy yay _meta_end_exclamation_

 candy obama screamed as he scampered off towards mahmoud s van _meta_end_dot_

 this just in senator barack obama has made a deal with mahmoud ahmadinejad to cut off all ties with israel in exchange for five candy bars the anchorman said _meta_end_dot_

 i heard ahmadinejad tried to only give him only four candy bars the anchorwoman commented but obama negotiated him up to five _meta_end_dot_

 he is so shrewd _meta_end_dot_

 i just love him so much _meta_end_dot_

 i want to give myself to him sexually the anchorman nodded _meta_end_dot_

 me too _meta_end_dot_

 i bet he has soft hands _meta_end_dot_

 anyway john mccain who i remind you is very old was quick to condemn obama s diplomacy calling obama a little whippersnapper and told him and all his buddies to stay off his lawn i guess he doesn t like black people the anchorwoman added _meta_end_dot_

 the anchorman nodded again _meta_end_dot_

 he is a republican this satire was used with the permission of imao _meta_end_dot_
