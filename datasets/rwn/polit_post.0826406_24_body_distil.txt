  original email i received dear jay i probably have some agreement with you that the aclu takes seperation of church and state way too far i don t see that a prayer at a graduation is any violation of a so called seperation of church and state jay my problem arises when we look at some of the ultra conservative ideas to expand we have seen lately from the bush administration when it comes to shredding our fourth amendment and on those issues i m thankful for the aclu in addition with our economy going into a tailspin in part because of the supply side economics and sillly idea that the markets can regulate themselves of bush and mccain what i m trying to say jay is that the gop and far right wing pro corporate agenda of the right is almost as sickening as some on the hyper secular left that you talk about look we are in a mess jay and its not democrats its the _meta_number_ref_ years of gop policy from _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ so when you combine your rehetoric against the aclu with rhetoric attacking obama and complimenting bush and mccain you have destroy your credibility tthere are many on the left who are not part of the secular left and would have some agreement with you but any effort to join the gop team and group together absolutely destroys your credibility and doesn t help our cause to fight for more relisgous liberties and unlike you something i cherish civil liberties travis my response i m gonna guess that you are a conservative leaning libertarian _meta_end_dot_

 i could be wrong with the way you talk about the right wing though _meta_end_dot_

 however i proudly call myself a conservative and embarrassingly call myself a republican _meta_end_dot_

 it isn t about party _meta_end_dot_

 i don t disagree with everything the aclu does _meta_end_dot_

 i just think they are a fraud and dangerously misguided far to the left _meta_end_dot_

 i believe in civil liberties _meta_end_dot_

 i just think the aclu take those liberties too far to a dangerous level _meta_end_dot_

 their advocacy of having child molesters live across the street from playgrounds and elementary schools is too far for me _meta_end_dot_

 their advocacy that looking at child porn should be freedom of speech is too far _meta_end_dot_

 their hypocrisy in fighting against listening in to phone calls to known terrorist over privacy issues while keeping a database of their member s personal financial history is too far _meta_end_dot_

 their attacks on free speech for christians are too far and on top of that hypocrisy when they have restricted their own board member s speech _meta_end_dot_

 i don t want to stop the defending of the bill of rights _meta_end_dot_

 i want to stop the perversion of the constitution _meta_end_dot_

 i also want to stop taxpayer funding paying the aclu s cases they convince left wing judges of that the majority of american taxpayers don t agree with _meta_end_dot_

 i m tired of these legal groups destroying the foundation of our constitution _meta_end_dot_

 if homosexuals want equal rights then convince enough people to amend the constitution like they did for abolishing slavery _meta_end_dot_

 they only hurt their cause when they convince judges to push it on a population not ready to accept it _meta_end_dot_

 then they only get reactions from politicians ready to represent the will of the people who put constitutional amendments to ban such things before the people _meta_end_dot_

 the people react just as you would expect and it makes everything that much harder _meta_end_dot_

 they hurt their own cause by going the route of the judiciary _meta_end_dot_

 the aclu is a partisan organization that should not receive any tax exemption as they do _meta_end_dot_

 they separate their organization into two so they can lobby and play the courts _meta_end_dot_

 they are evil _meta_end_dot_

 crossposted from staclu should i have said more _meta_end_question_

 i ll update this post if and when i get a response _meta_end_dot_

 in the meantime chime in with your responses _meta_end_dot_
