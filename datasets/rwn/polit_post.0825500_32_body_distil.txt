  t hey just cannot help themselves part oh the heck with it i ve lost count _meta_end_dot_

 measured and rational dissent _meta_end_question_

 phaaa _meta_end_dot_

 not among the nutty left _meta_end_dot_

 cintra wilson of salon on sarah palin i don t want sarah palin being the representative leader and custodian of my rights my constitution and my country any more than i want polygamist compound leader warren jeffs baby sitting for my preteen goddaughters _meta_end_dot_

 as a woman who does not believe what palin believes the thought of such an opportunistic anti female in the white house in the cheney chair no less is akin to ideological brain rape _meta_end_dot_

 what this republican blowup doll does with her own insides in accord with her own faith is her business _meta_end_dot_

 but like the worst and most terrifying of religious extremists she seems very comfortable with the idea of imposing her own views on everyone else _meta_end_dot_

 i did not think that women being downgraded to second class three holed chattel would be a pressing concern in my lifetime _meta_end_dot_

 i thought it was like polio or witch burning an inhumane error that had already been corrected _meta_end_dot_

 but after eight years of republican hegemony and now the potential ascendance of this sheep in ewe s clothing i am so mortally offended i feel like it is really time for women to be angry hardcore and disgusted again _meta_end_dot_

 not just with old white christian patriarchs and their hopelessly calcified religiously condoned misogyny but also with the self abnegating submissive female uncle tommies whose ambitions and eagerness to please the powerful males of their tribe are so desperate that they would sell out their sovereignty over their own bodies _meta_end_dot_

 and yours too _meta_end_dot_

 how badly does this woman scare these faux feminists _meta_end_question_

 read those three paragraphs and marvel _meta_end_dot_

 but check out this bit of analysis sarah palin in this light makes so little sense that she makes perfect sense _meta_end_dot_

 she speciously represents a new power paradigm of the nice mommy the opposite of hillary the mean mommy the opposite of oprah black and therefore foreign the opposite of martha stewart another mean mommy _meta_end_dot_

 in her support for women on women s issues she has done everything but volunteer for her own circumcision _meta_end_dot_

 she tacitly promises a roll backward into old fashioned sexual roles like old testament style old _meta_end_dot_

 her morality is fixed predictable and inflexible _meta_end_dot_

 there are those who will find comfort in the fact that they will know exactly what can be expected from palin free will subordinated to obedience of an airtight evangelical interpretation of the demands of god country and republican men _meta_end_dot_

 nice mommy and mean mommy _meta_end_question_

 nothing repressed there _meta_end_dot_

 but check out the sexual roles line _meta_end_dot_

 how does a woman who is the governor of a state and whose husband is the first dude roll backward into old fashioned sexual roles _meta_end_question_

 and especially old testament style old _meta_end_question_

 does she even know what old fashioned rolls were _meta_end_question_

 and especially old testament style old would be _meta_end_question_

 can anything be more ludicrous than that claim _meta_end_question_

 well yes the next couple of lines her morality is fixed predictable and inflexible _meta_end_dot_

 free will subordinated to obedience of an airtight evangelical interpretation of the demands of god country and republican men yeah _meta_end_question_

 tell that to frank murkowski don young and ted stevens _meta_end_dot_

 by the way my morality is fixed predictable and inflexible as well _meta_end_dot_

 that s why it s called morality _meta_end_dot_

 and why is free will necessary subordinated to the obedience of one s morality if that morality is freely chosen and voluntarily followed _meta_end_question_

 sounds like an act of free will to me _meta_end_dot_

 what you get out of all this is palin s authentic feminism terrifies this fake _meta_end_dot_

 sarah palin and her virtual burqa have me and my friends retching into our handbags _meta_end_dot_

 she s such a power mad backwater beauty pageant casualty it s easy to write her off and make fun of her _meta_end_dot_

 but in reality i feel as horrified as a ghetto jew watching the rise of national socialism _meta_end_dot_

 i m sure this cretin thinks this is just the snarkiest and best put down of sarah palin yet to reach the reading public _meta_end_dot_

 the fact that it displays in living color how bankrupt the so called feminist movement has become most likely didn t even occur to her _meta_end_dot_

 if i had a handbag i d be retching in it after reading the vile hate in wilson s screed _meta_end_dot_

 camile paglia succinctly identified this nutcase when she said a feminism that cannot admire the bravura under high pressure of the first woman governor of a frontier state isn t worth a warm bucket of spit _meta_end_dot_

 nothing more than witch trial hysteria _meta_end_dot_
