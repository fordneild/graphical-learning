  you ll find peggy noonan s latest column linked at conservative grapevine _meta_end_dot_

 she articulates well the trouble with obama s candidacy that is beginning to percolate mr _meta_end_dot_

 obama did not really have a good week in spite of winning a primary and a caucus and both resoundingly _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 his problem was is his wife s words not his the speech in which she said that for the first time in her adult life she is proud of her country because obama is winning _meta_end_dot_

 she later repeated it then tried to explain it saying of course she loves her country _meta_end_dot_

 but damage was done _meta_end_dot_

 why _meta_end_question_

 because her statement focused attention on what i suspect are some basic and elementary questions that were starting to bubble out there anyway _meta_end_dot_

 here are a few of them _meta_end_dot_

 are the obamas at bottom snobs _meta_end_question_

 do they understand america _meta_end_question_

 are they of it _meta_end_question_

 did anyone at their ivy league universities school them in why one should love america _meta_end_question_

 do they confuse patriotism with nationalism or nativism _meta_end_question_

 are they more inspired by abstractions like international justice than by old visions of america as the city on a hill which is how john winthrop saw it and ronald reagan and jfk spoke of it _meta_end_question_

 have they been throughout their adulthood so pampered and praised so raised in the liberal cocoon that they are essentially unaware of what and how normal americans think _meta_end_question_

 and are they in this like those cosseted yuppies the clintons _meta_end_question_

 why is all this actually not a distraction but a real issue _meta_end_question_

 because americans have common sense and are bottom line _meta_end_dot_

 they think like this _meta_end_dot_

 if the president and his first lady are not loyal first to america and its interests who will be _meta_end_question_

 the president of france _meta_end_question_

 but it s his job to love france and protect its interests _meta_end_dot_

 if america s leaders don t love america tenderly who will _meta_end_question_

 and there is a context _meta_end_dot_

 so many americans right now fear they are losing their country that the old america is slipping away and being replaced by something worse something formless and hollowed out _meta_end_dot_

 they can see we are giving up our sovereignty that our leaders will not control our borders that we don t teach the young the old fashioned love of america that the government has taken to itself such power and made things so complex and at the end of the day when they count up sales tax property tax state tax federal tax they are paying a lot of money to lose the place they loved _meta_end_dot_

 and if you feel you re losing america you really don t want a couple in the white house whose rope of affection to the country seems lightly held casual provisional _meta_end_dot_

 america is backing barack at the moment so america is good _meta_end_dot_

 when it becomes angry with president barack will that mean america is bad _meta_end_question_

 john hawkins touched upon obama s patriotism problem as well _meta_end_dot_

 obama acts like a man who has little use for his own country and michelle obama seems to be in the same place _meta_end_dot_

 when pressed on the patriotism question she can muster a weak smile and she can praise america for it s possibilities as if the country is one giant underachiever but that s about it _meta_end_dot_

 if you have about three minutes watch the video clip here at cnn political ticker and tell me whether you think this is an adequate recovery by michelle obama from her gaffe of saying that for the first time she is proud of her country _meta_end_dot_

 i think it s a partial recovery but not enough to dispel the doubts michelle obama has created _meta_end_dot_

 what i conclude from the video is that michelle obama can say the appropriate words at least half way convincingly _meta_end_dot_

 after realizing the fallout from her words and after having had her opportunities pointed out to her michelle obama is capable of admitting that she has had opportunities in america that do reflect rather well on the country _meta_end_dot_

 in the interview clip michelle obama makes the obligatory statement that she loves her country and acknowledges the educational opportunities she and her husband have had but she also uses the word possibilities three times to try to explain how she likes america _meta_end_dot_

 that s condemning with faint praise _meta_end_dot_

 america is not just possibilities that have yet to be realized _meta_end_dot_

 america is a dream come true _meta_end_dot_

 it is a dream long since realized and still going strong _meta_end_dot_

 america has been delivering real freedom real economic opportunity real prosperity and more for a long long time _meta_end_dot_

 just ask bill gates _meta_end_dot_

 just ask colin powell _meta_end_dot_

 just ask america s astronauts _meta_end_dot_

 ask the people of france whom american soldiers fought and died to free _meta_end_dot_

 ask the people of afghanistan who no longer witness regular arbitrary executions at soccer stadiums _meta_end_dot_

 ask the people of iraq _meta_end_dot_

 ask the people of japan who were conquered after they attacked america but then freed to govern themselves in a democracy and who are living in great economic prosperity today as a result _meta_end_dot_

 ask the millions of men and women who have fled to america from countries all around the world _meta_end_dot_

 why do you suppose that is _meta_end_question_

 for the possibilities of america or for its reality _meta_end_question_

 just ask tsunami victims halfway around the world who were sent billions of dollars in aid from america _meta_end_dot_

 just ask men and women and children in africa who are alive today thanks to aid from the united states of america _meta_end_dot_

 were they saved by america s possibilities _meta_end_question_

 just ask the millions of americans who are alive today thanks to the outstanding quality of medical care that america provides to its own people from vaccinations to open heart surgery to innovative cancer treatments _meta_end_dot_

 the list goes on and on _meta_end_dot_

 i could point to a thousand corners of america or corners of the world touched beneficently by america _meta_end_dot_

 almost everywhere you look there is another miracle in progress _meta_end_dot_

 the computer that sits on your desk or in your lap or in your hand right now another economic miracle owed largely if not exclusively to america _meta_end_dot_

 america is not just possibilities it is already a dream come true _meta_end_dot_

 if you don t agree with that much ms _meta_end_dot_

 obama then i m not sure you really do understand the possibilities of america nor the source from which they spring _meta_end_dot_

 i m sorry mr _meta_end_dot_

 and mrs _meta_end_dot_

 obama but i don t just love america for her possibilities and if you don t love america for what she already is i don t think i particularly care about your grand vision for america _meta_end_dot_

 if there s something to the obama patriotisim problem and i think there is it will come back to haunt obama again and again during the campaign _meta_end_dot_
