  fred hiatt does a good job in one column of destroying the democrats partisan effort to produce a phony intelligence committee report demonstrating that bush and cheney lied in order to get us into iraq _meta_end_dot_

 but dive into rockefeller s report in search of where exactly president bush lied about what his intelligence agencies were telling him about the threat posed by saddam hussein and you may be surprised by what you find _meta_end_dot_

 hiatt then goes on to use the report s own words to demonstrate that bush s claims at the time were substantiated by intelligence information and of course jay rockefeller the democratic chairman of the senate intelligence committee report was one of the most vociferous in his claims in _meta_number_ref_ about the danger that saddam hussein posed _meta_end_dot_

 after all it was not bush but rockefeller who said in october _meta_number_ref_ there has been some debate over how imminent a threat iraq poses _meta_end_dot_

 i do believe iraq poses an imminent threat _meta_end_dot_

 i also believe after september _meta_number_ref_ that question is increasingly outdated _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 to insist on further evidence could put some of our fellow americans at risk _meta_end_dot_

 can we afford to take that chance _meta_end_question_

 i do not think we can unsurprisingly the democrats didn t include such statements and the many others like it that democrats had made in _meta_number_ref_ after looking at the same reports that bush was looking at _meta_end_dot_

 stephen hayes who has been a tiger on researching the connections between al qaeda backed terrorists and the hussein government reminds us that jay rockefeller was quite convinced of those connections before we went into iraq _meta_end_dot_

 it s also worth pointing out that the jay rockefeller who today accuses the bush administration of inventing the threat posed by iraq al qaeda collaboration once saw a substantial connection between the two and warned about the consequences of leaving iraq to pass its wmd to osama bin laden _meta_end_dot_

 on february _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ rockefeller said the fact that zarqawi certainly is related to the death of the u s _meta_end_dot_

 aid officer and that he is very close to bin laden puts at rest in fairly dramatic terms that there is at least a substantial connection between saddam and al qaeda the new york sun highlights some more evidence that the majority wanted to keep out of its report such at the state department s assessment of the presence of al qaeda s presence in iraq and its operations that went on with the knowledge and acquiescence of saddam s regime as hiatt points out the crucial lesson we have learned is that our intelligence was quite fallible _meta_end_dot_

 presidents have to make decisions based on such faulty intelligence _meta_end_dot_

 decision making would be a lot easier if we had absolute certainty to go on but we don t _meta_end_dot_

 but the phony bush lied story line distracts from the biggest prewar failure the fact that so much of the intelligence upon which bush and rockefeller and everyone else relied turned out to be tragically catastrophically wrong _meta_end_dot_

 and it trivializes a double dilemma that president bill clinton faced before bush and that president obama or mccain may well face after when to act on a threat in the inevitable absence of perfect intelligence and how to mobilize popular support for such action if deemed essential for national security in a democracy that will always and rightly be reluctant _meta_end_dot_

 for the next president it may be iran s nuclear program or al qaeda sanctuaries in pakistan or more likely some potential horror that today no one even imagines _meta_end_dot_

 when that time comes there will be plenty of warnings to heed from the iraq experience without the need to fictionalize more _meta_end_dot_

 this is the real concern that we should have going forward how to make dangerous decisions based on uncertain information not trying to once again put forth partisan attacks based on filtered information to show try to prove that bush lied and people died _meta_end_dot_

 the anchoress has more _meta_end_dot_
