  if bill clinton can get above _meta_percent_ref_ in the polls he can start dating again fritz hollings now typically i m the first person to sneer at stories that come from trashy gossip rags like the globe but they just might be onto something here the former president was caught on camera holding hands with an attractive _meta_number_ref_ year old woman after a speaking engagement in edmonton alberta _meta_end_dot_

 she s been identified as avra siegel who worked as a national advance person for hillary clinton s presidential campaign _meta_end_dot_

 in a _meta_number_ref_ frame sequence clinton is seen leaving the hotel descending the steps while shaking a few hands then reaching his car turning and noticing avra _meta_end_dot_

 he could have gotten into his vehicle but instead he turns and looks over to where she s standing says sun photo editor tom braid _meta_end_dot_

 he reaches out grabs her hand waves lets go touches her on her shoulder and leaves braid says avra had an all access pass for the event including the green room an area of the stage where speakers can relax before going on _meta_end_dot_

 the hand holding lasted a few seconds says baird _meta_end_dot_

 could it be innocent _meta_end_question_

 conceivably but it seems unlikely _meta_end_dot_

 i mean come on how many married guys are going to hold hands with a woman other than their wife in public _meta_end_question_

 and keep in mind that we re talking about bill clinton here a guy who s notorious for cheating on his wife _meta_end_dot_

 now he s photographed in public holding hands with a hotty he has been spending time around on the campaign and there s nothing going on _meta_end_question_

 sure _meta_end_dot_

 ps this is my favorite unintentionally funny part of the pic _meta_end_dot_

 an all access pass to bill clinton _meta_end_question_

 yeah i bet d _meta_end_dot_

 ps _meta_number_ref_ i feel sorry for the girl because a lot of people including hillary are going to figure that she s having an affair with bill and if need be bill will shove her under a bus so fast it will make her head spin _meta_end_dot_
