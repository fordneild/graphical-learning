  a s barack obama is finding out if polls are any indication one week after sen _meta_end_dot_

 hillary clinton made a public show of unity with sen _meta_end_dot_

 barack obama a new survey suggests supporters of the new york senator are increasingly less likely to follow her lead _meta_end_dot_

 a growing number of clinton supporters polled say they may stay home in november instead of casting their ballot for obama an indication the party has yet to coalesce around the illinois senator four weeks after the most prolonged and at times divisive primary race in modern american history came to a close _meta_end_dot_

 according to a cnn opinion research corp _meta_end_dot_

 poll released friday the number of clinton supporters who plan to defect to republican sen _meta_end_dot_

 john mccain s camp is down from one month ago but in what could be an ominous sign for obama as he seeks to unify the party the number of them who say they plan to vote for obama is also down and a growing number say they may not vote at all _meta_end_dot_

 reading through the comment sections on a number of lefty blog i ran across quite a few commenters who claim they ll not be voting for obama for various reasons _meta_end_dot_

 kos even put out a post saying he wasn t going to reward bad behavior i e obama s move to the right with a donation _meta_end_dot_

 and the latest thing which has put them off is the seeming softening of his stance on late term abortions _meta_end_dot_

 whether or not those commenters actually hold to what they re saying remains to be seen of course but at the moment they don t seem to be quite as happy with their new politician as they once were _meta_end_dot_

 anyway the latest numbers in a cnn opinion research corp _meta_end_dot_

 survey completed in early june before the new york senator ended her white house bid _meta_number_ref_ percent of clinton backers polled said they planned on voting for obama _meta_end_dot_

 in the latest poll that number has dropped to _meta_number_ref_ percent _meta_end_dot_

 in early june _meta_number_ref_ percent of clinton supporters polled said they would not vote at all if obama were the party s nominee now close to a third say they will stay home _meta_end_dot_

 in another sign the wounds of the heated primary race have yet to heal _meta_number_ref_ percent of registered democrats polled still say they would prefer clinton to be the party s presidential nominee _meta_end_dot_

 that number is significantly higher than it was in early june when _meta_number_ref_ percent of democrats polled said they preferred clinton to lead the party s presidential ticket _meta_end_dot_

 you d think that those numbers would begin to come down at this stage instead of going up _meta_end_dot_

 it would seem the disappointment of a clinton loss has been exacerbated by obama s rather clumsy move toward the center _meta_end_dot_

 clinton supporters reluctant to vote for obama may be using that move to the right as further justification for not voting for obama as if clinton wouldn t have tried the same maneuver _meta_end_dot_

 while it is way too early to give this poll much credence it is still a potential problem for an obama candidacy _meta_end_dot_

 if a third of the clinton supporters do indeed stay home and a decent number of them cross over and vote for mccain it could spell real trouble for obama _meta_end_dot_

 as he s finding out unity doesn t become a reality just because you announce that to be the case in a town called unity _meta_end_dot_
