  benazir bhutto has been assassinated and given that pakistan is a chaotic backwards unstable country inhabited by way too many islamic extremists this probably isn t likely to help the situation _meta_end_dot_

 on the other hand everyone is speculating wildly about the consequences of this and it s very difficult to say at this point how this will impact the stability of the country long term _meta_end_dot_

 in any case this latest murder committed by al qaeda was a detestable act _meta_end_dot_

 with that in mind i certainly hope the pakistanis will give us the opportunity to take revenge for our own dead by helping them pay al qaeda back in blood for this assassination
