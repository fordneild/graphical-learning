  have you ever noticed that global warming alarmists relentlessly hype anything that they think proves their case but then they immediately go quiet when enormous holes are blown in the key pieces of evidence that they ve been using _meta_end_question_

 isn t that a pretty good indication that they re more interested in pushing political propaganda than science _meta_end_question_

 for example how many times have you heard global warming fanatics point to the melting ice caps and hysterically shriek something like the polar bears are all drowning to death man _meta_end_exclamation_

 know why _meta_end_question_

 because the ice caps have almost melted _meta_end_exclamation_

 the water from all that ice is going to swamp the coasts new york is going to be under _meta_number_ref_ ft _meta_end_dot_

 of water and we re all going to die and wow this is some good acid man _meta_end_exclamation_

 i can hear my hand talking to me about penguins well there s one problem with that bit of global warming propaganda satellite data shows that concerns over the levels of sea ice may have been premature _meta_end_dot_

 it was feared that the polar caps were vanishing because of the effects of global warming _meta_end_dot_

 but figures from the respected us national oceanic and atmospheric administration show that almost all the lost ice has come back _meta_end_dot_

 ice levels which had shrunk from _meta_number_ref_million sq km in january _meta_number_ref_ to just four million in october are almost back to their original levels _meta_end_dot_

 figures show that there is nearly a third more ice in antarctica than is usual for the time of year _meta_end_dot_

 the data flies in the face of many current thinkers and will be seized on by climate change sceptics who deny that the world is undergoing global warming _meta_end_dot_

 a photograph of polar bears clinging on to a melting iceberg has become one of the most enduring images in the campaign against climate change _meta_end_dot_

 it was used by former us vice president al gore during his inconvenient truth lectures about mankind s impact on the world _meta_end_dot_

 but scientists say the northern hemisphere has endured its coldest winter in decades _meta_end_dot_

 they add that snow cover across the area is at its greatest since _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 wait _meta_end_question_

 what happened to the whole area turning from glaciers to a nice warm broth filled with drowning polar bears flailing around haplessly in the open ocean _meta_end_question_

 at a minimum doesn t this suggest that we don t have anywhere near as good a handle on global warming and its effects as the people falsely let me repeat that falsely claiming that there is a scientific consensus on the issue say we do _meta_end_question_

 ps from the qando blog comment section so wait _meta_end_dot_

 during the year ice melted and now there s more ice _meta_end_question_

 my god it s like there s a link to temp and ice formation _meta_end_dot_

 if only we understood it_meta_beep_ref_ scott jacobs hat tip to the qando blog for the story _meta_end_dot_
