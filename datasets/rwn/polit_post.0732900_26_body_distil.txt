  linda boyd writes in the seattle post intelligencer impeachment if not now when _meta_end_question_

 complete with fake mug shots of president bush and vice president cheney _meta_end_dot_

 how about never does never work for you linda _meta_end_question_

 i m looking forward to hearing from linda boyd an her ilk again in about three years i m guessing she ll be calling for impeachment of the next president too if she and her crowd have any intellectual consistency at all that s because about _meta_percent_ref_ of what the white house has done that the impeachment crowd objects to consists of simple common sense _meta_end_dot_

 regardless of who the next president may be it will be a learning process for the impeachment lobby if a democrat is elected the lessons will be particularly painful _meta_end_dot_
