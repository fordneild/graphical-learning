  sunday was travel day in my quest to document the gop convention the alarm went off way too early this morning _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ am to be exact _meta_end_dot_

 i slowly slipped out of bed and got my self together for a _meta_number_ref_ am shuttle pick up _meta_end_dot_

 not such a bad deal right _meta_end_question_

 however my flight was scheduled to leave at _meta_number_ref_ am and i live _meta_number_ref_ minutes away from phl _meta_end_dot_

 thanks to dave s shuttle service i found myself at philly s airport watching a spectacular sunrise as i sat at my assigned gate _meta_end_dot_

 wolf blitzer buzzed in the background relentlessly obsessing over hurricanes gustav and katrina _meta_end_dot_

 according to air trans flight schedules i had to fly south on order to go north _meta_end_dot_

 the journey to msp had a pit stop in atlanta georgia _meta_end_dot_

 the first leg of this flight was lightly filled and i had the luxury of a row of seats to myself _meta_end_dot_

 atlanta to msp was a whole different enchilada _meta_end_dot_

 a two hour layover in atlanta was spent in a one sided discussion of ethanol as a the alternative energy source _meta_end_dot_

 yikes lobbyists _meta_end_exclamation_

 on a gop delegate packed flight i had the honor of spending quality time with mr _meta_end_dot_

 marbles a rather large and rather drugged cat _meta_end_dot_

 his owner had her own set of peculiarities such as covering mr _meta_end_dot_

 marbles in her lap with her skirt hoping the stewards would not notice _meta_end_dot_

 oh the joys of travel _meta_end_dot_

 at long last i reached minneapolis st paul and all was golden _meta_end_dot_

 a quick phone call to the hotel and a shuttle was dispatched to whisk me to my final destination _meta_end_dot_

 the concierge was careful to describe the shuttle van white with marriot written on the sides _meta_end_dot_

 within _meta_number_ref_ minutes a white van with marriot written on the side pulls up and i am leaping out to greet him _meta_end_dot_

 airport marriot he asks _meta_end_dot_

 that would be me i told him as i tossed him my suitcase and jumped in the shuttle _meta_end_dot_

 it turns out he meant another airport marriot than the one i meant _meta_end_dot_

 the good people at the wrong marriot explained to me that they could not shuttle me to the marriot where i had reservations but would take me back to the airport shuttle pick up where i could wait for the right shuttle _meta_end_dot_

 yep i could not make this stuff up even if i tried _meta_end_dot_

 once at my hotel i had to quickly request a cab to get to minneapolis convention center to pick up my press credentials _meta_end_dot_

 shuttle service does not start till monday _meta_end_dot_

 brilliant just brilliant _meta_end_dot_

 on the way to the convention center my cabbie named muhammed ali struck up a conversation with me regarding all the planning going on for the convention _meta_end_dot_

 he asked if i worked as a journalist and i quickly informed him that i am a blogger _meta_end_dot_

 he began relating his encounter with journalists he recently transported between st _meta_end_dot_

 paul and minnesota _meta_end_dot_

 he mentioned their comments stating the dnc convention was a great party and they weren t too pleased to have to cover the rnc _meta_end_dot_

 interesting factoid no _meta_end_question_

 i wandered outside the convention center after collecting my press credentials where i encountered code pink in anemic numbers _meta_end_dot_

 susie benjamin was present and i noted that she had no fake press pass on her person _meta_end_dot_

 i videotaped a discussion with one of the pinkies _meta_end_dot_

 a waste of good space on the hard drive _meta_end_exclamation_

 not thirty feet from the clueless peaceniks were two gentlemen handing out copies of obsession quite the juxtaposition of women without a clue and noble intellectualism with south beach style _meta_end_dot_

 minneapolis is a fantastic city to walk about _meta_end_dot_

 i took some time to walk along marquette street taking photos as the images presented themselves to me before heading back to st _meta_end_dot_

 paul _meta_end_dot_

 another impression of this city comes from its citizens _meta_end_dot_

 they are the most sincerely friendly people i ve come across outside of the sheepdogs _meta_end_dot_

 fantabulous discussion with cabbie on way back to my hotel _meta_end_dot_

 i got a good feel of the mid western perception on social and political issues _meta_end_dot_

 governer pawlenty was mentioned often i am considering recruiting pawlenty to run for governor in pennsylvania _meta_end_dot_

 as pennsylvania is in desperate need of principled leadership and good governance _meta_end_dot_

 oh i had plenty time to discuss these issues as the cabbie got lost on the way to my hotel _meta_end_dot_

 he stopped the counter when he realized his mistake _meta_end_dot_

 like i said above quite good people _meta_end_dot_

 it was a long day but well worth the opportunity to be part of history in the making _meta_end_dot_

 i would not change this day no matter what may come _meta_end_dot_
