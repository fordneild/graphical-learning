  i ve always had my doubts about john mccain as our presidential nominee but i can t help but very much admire his wife who seems to be as humble generous and gracious as she is beautiful _meta_end_dot_

 and until this morning when i heard her speak at a fundraiser for her husband i have had little desire to attend one of his events _meta_end_dot_

 after hearing her glowing affirmation of mccain however unsurprising i believe i m a little more at ease about the next four years _meta_end_dot_

 with a poise that could rival any first lady cindy mccain spoke today about how humbled she was to be in the position she is in at present and how she has confidence in her husband as the greatest man she s ever known to be the leader of our country _meta_end_dot_

 she refrained from getting political instead discussing the qualities of his character the things that first attracted me to john are things that i think are what attract him to the american people naming among them intelligence strength and courage _meta_end_dot_

 she affirmed what a good father he was to their children always making time for them in his schedule and never missing out on any of the important events in their lives _meta_end_dot_

 to be sure we ve heard all of this more times than we can count over the past year but if i m like anyone else most of us don t simply eat up a candidate s praises of himself without some substantive reason _meta_end_dot_

 yet cindy s genuine words seemed sincere enough to give him credibility as though she wouldn t be here today if she didn t fully believe he had what it takes to be america s next president _meta_end_dot_

 if nothing else i d have to agree with lew eisenberg today s host and finance chairman of the rnc when he said that cindy was a sure testament to mccain s good judgment cindy also talked about her recent experience in rwanda with the one campaign where was inspired to continue helping those who need help she was never so humbled never felt so small as when she spoke to a young woman there who after witnessing her family being murdered and then being gang raped and left for dead had the grace and fortitude to forgive her offenders she hoped to be strong for the good of her country _meta_end_dot_

 it was touching to see someone as affluent and privileged as cindy mccain so moved by what she saw in this woman and in the rwandan people _meta_end_dot_

 she s been a humanitarian for years and i m sure she would make the most of her position if she were first lady _meta_end_dot_

 in the end i guess my point is that while my support for john mccain is more out of necessity than my liking for him his wife makes him more appealing in the same way that michelle obama has made barack look like less of a patriot _meta_end_dot_

 clearly there s a reason she hasn t been in the public eye much since her first time i m proud of my country statements _meta_end_dot_

 if today s crowd was any indicator however republicans around the state seem to have a great deal of respect and admiration for cindy there was a constant buzz about what a good first couple the two would make _meta_end_dot_

 especially considering the alternative _meta_end_dot_

 incidentally i sat next to two democratic hillary supporters at the event who had decided to join mccain s campaign and make a permanent switch to the republican party expressing their strong dislike of barack obama and lamenting that the democrat party is no longer what it used to be they both assured the rest of us that there are plenty of others out there who are like them and november was looking good for mccain _meta_end_dot_

 i m still waiting to see whether it will be looking good for conservatives but in the meantime i m quite thrilled to see what a strong role model america might have in cindy mccain _meta_end_dot_

 as she promised today she hopes to be the best representative she can for young women from what i can tell though she s got the potential to reach far beyond this realm _meta_end_dot_

 many thanks to republican fundraiser candy straight for the invitation _meta_end_dot_

 cross posted from conservatives with attitude _meta_end_exclamation_
