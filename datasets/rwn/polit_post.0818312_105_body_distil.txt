  to start off as many of you have already read obama threw wes clark if not under the bus at least into the bumper as he s said many times before senator obama honors and respects senator mccain s service and of course he rejects yesterday s statement by general clark said obama campaign spokeman bill burton _meta_end_dot_

 is this what the hope n change xpress will bring us throughout the campaign _meta_end_question_

 some obama supporter comes out says something nasty gets the talking point out there for all to see then obama who really needs to wash the blood and gore off his bus at this time runs them over then reaps the benefit of the nastiness while attempting to keep his hands clean _meta_end_question_

 democrats do not seem to want to blame obama at all yet blamed bush for the actions of a few low level military members at a prison in iraq _meta_end_dot_

 but clark won t back down politico there are many important issues in this presidential election clearly one of the most important issues is national security and keeping the american people safe _meta_end_dot_

 in my opinion protecting the american people is the most important duty of our next president _meta_end_dot_

 i have made comments in the past about john mccain s service and i want to reiterate them in order be crystal clear _meta_end_dot_

 as i have said before i honor john mccain s service as a prisoner of war and a vietnam veteran _meta_end_dot_

 he was a hero to me and to hundreds of thousands and millions of others in armed forces as a prisoner of war _meta_end_dot_

 i would never dishonor the service of someone who chose to wear the uniform for our nation _meta_end_dot_

 john mccain is running his campaign on his experience and how his experience would benefit him and our nation as president _meta_end_dot_

 that experience shows courage and commitment to our country but it doesn t include executive experience wrestling with national policy or go to war decisions _meta_end_dot_

 and in this area his judgment has been flawed he not only supported going into a war we didn t have to fight in iraq but has time and again undervalued other non military elements of national power that must be used effectively to protect america but as an american and former military officer i will not back down if i believe someone doesn t have sound judgment when it comes to our nation s most critical issues _meta_end_dot_

 now let s look seriously at the issue _meta_end_dot_

 does being in the military and being a pow give mccain executive ability no _meta_end_dot_

 not by itself _meta_end_dot_

 he sure doesn t have the experience like some others who almost started world war iii with the russians _meta_end_dot_

 but you add that to his long service in government and it certainly gives him a hell of a lot more then senator neophyte who according to wes clark is not ready because he has no experience wrestling with national policy or go to war decisions _meta_end_dot_

 funny how that works eh _meta_end_question_

 now as pointed out in the comments the democrats thought john kerry s _meta_number_ref_ months in vietnam was enough to give him executive ability _meta_end_dot_

 but mccain s doesn t _meta_end_dot_

 what i want in a president is someone who will lead who has vision knows how to work with others and looks mostly toward what is best for the people not what they think is best for the people _meta_end_dot_

 update bob dole blasts sir wesley dole the _meta_number_ref_ republican presidential nominee said that clark s statement was beyond comprehension and his absurd remarks signal further erosion in our nation s political discourse _meta_end_dot_

 he should have stayed in bed sunday morning _meta_end_dot_

 it s unfortunate that a former general who ran for the presidency on his own war record thinks it appropriate to attack a distinguished veteran and former prisoner of war in this way _meta_end_dot_

 sen _meta_end_dot_

 mccain s entire life has been devoted to public service _meta_end_dot_

 his achievement and experience constitute unparalleled qualification for america s highest office
