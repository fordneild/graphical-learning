  the democratic debate last night was certainly more interesting than the vegas lovefest _meta_end_dot_

 still the democratic debates are always ultimately a little scary because all the candidates believe in promise everything to everybody socialism _meta_end_dot_

 the solution to every problem is attacking successful people and businesses spending more tax dollars and giving more power to the government _meta_end_dot_

 so essentially when you try to decide who the winners and losers are you re just picking the big government socialist with the most pleasing personality _meta_end_dot_

 that would be barack obama who is funnier and quicker on his feet than his rivals _meta_end_dot_

 additionally barack doesn t play the race card while hillary regularly engages in gender warfare and edwards is exceptionally crude about playing the class warfare card _meta_end_dot_

 so the winner _meta_end_question_

 barack obama _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_nd _meta_end_question_

 john edwards _meta_end_dot_

 loser _meta_end_question_

 hillary clinton _meta_end_dot_

 but despite all the sound and fury there wasn t a lot of substance in this debate and what there was has been covered a dozen times before _meta_end_dot_

 so there isn t a lot of distance between first and last in this debate and i don t know that it particularly helps or hurts any of them _meta_end_dot_

 here are some of the comments of note about the debate i ran across around the blogosphere i realize the country i love has its problems _meta_end_dot_

 but i listen to the democratic candidates and they describe an america coming apart at the seams _meta_end_dot_

 john edwards goes on and on about the little girl who couldn t afford a coat and who he s going to tax us in order to get her one and the woman who is going to lose her children because she can t afford her energy bills and the streets filled with the homeless and the predators offering people home loans they can t afford and apparently forcing them to accept them and the women and african americans experiencing a daily gauntlet of oppression and discrimination and hatred and cackling employers lashing their employees and the dark skies filling with locusts and plague and pestilence and famine and war stalking the land jim geraghty the campaign spot i only watched part of the debate _meta_end_dot_

 but it is simply impossible to listen to john edwards _meta_end_dot_

 everything he says is entirely predictable his face is annoyingly wrinkle free and hairless in some odd way and the slight hint of tremulousness as he finds an opportunity to insert some sad story makes me want to barf _meta_end_dot_

 and i don t believe a word he says _meta_end_dot_

 hillary is just so familiar _meta_end_dot_

 she is smart enough _meta_end_dot_

 her rhetoric is meant to persuade not inspire but it is all so calculated and we have heard this so long that it is hard to be persuaded her biggest weakness is bill _meta_end_dot_

 every time he came up which was a lot i hoped everyone else in tv land had that vague sense of ennui that could lead to a decision not to bring back the clinton show _meta_end_dot_

 but you know she sure is dogged _meta_end_dot_

 and that audience sees the world exactly as she does _meta_end_dot_

 obama s great strength is that he seems intellectually alive and kind of interesting _meta_end_dot_

 he alone of the three knows that we have just come through thirty years of unparalleled economic growth _meta_end_dot_

 even especially in the south _meta_end_dot_

 he is the only possible answer to which one would you choose to have dinner with he might actually say something that wasn t entirely a matter of positioning just because it was interesting or true lisa schiffren at the corner all in all obama probably wins in that he seems the least weird of the three and is the least obviously disingenuous _meta_end_dot_

 hillary talks about opposing lobbyists and bringing honest people to her administration but she s married to one of the world s most notorious liars and she ll bring the likes of sandy berger back to power if she s elected _meta_end_dot_

 not to mention who ll be her co president _meta_end_dot_

 edwards sees a dickensian america from his ginormous mansion but while there are certainly americans who struggle to pay the bills by and large edwards solution to everything is government government and more government _meta_end_dot_

 obama is a likable bag of nothing _meta_end_dot_

 he s easy to watch and he s easy to listen to but what does he actually say _meta_end_question_

 none of the three seem to grasp national security or the source of wealth and prosperity in america _meta_end_dot_

 none of them seem to have set any limits to the power of government to serve their own aims and whims bryan hot air that was quite a change from the democrat debate snooze fest in nevada last week _meta_end_dot_

 total _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 obama showed he can stand up to shrillary face to face while remaining fairly unflappable and maintaining good humor _meta_end_dot_

 shrillary on the other hand can t keep a straight face and even voice despite finding her voice in new hampshire _meta_end_dot_

 they both have the glare _meta_end_dot_

 edwards relishes his white male candidate label way too much _meta_end_dot_

 bill clinton probably stayed awake for the whole thing _meta_end_dot_

 and finally i really really don t want any of these big government surrendercrats sitting in the white house michelle malkin first question three answers all the same bush bush bush _meta_end_dot_

 what are these people going to have to talk about or blame stuff on after he leaves office _meta_end_question_

 then they began squabbling on stage where charges and counter charges flew _meta_end_dot_

 hillary managed to get herself booed twice _meta_end_dot_

 best line if you re a dem was obama s when he said he was working in community service trying to do something about poverty when hillary was a corporate lawyer sitting on the board of wal mart _meta_end_dot_

 then suddenly the love fest where they waxed poetic about how all three of them may have their differences but they weren t republicans by god _meta_end_dot_

 it was during the love fest that i hit the off button on the remote and started reading a book qando for once i found myself agreeing with senators clinton and obama senator clinton is right that obama doesn t have enough experience to lead and senator obama is correct that clinton cannot be trusted _meta_end_dot_

 tonight s debate was further evidence that senators clinton and obama would lead america toward higher taxes and less security _meta_end_dot_

 with america s economy facing challenges the democrats tax and spend policies would be catastrophic _meta_end_dot_

 the democrats liberal plans are a stark contrast to the republican candidates commitment to winning the war on terror and keeping taxes low for hard working families rnc chairman mike duncan
