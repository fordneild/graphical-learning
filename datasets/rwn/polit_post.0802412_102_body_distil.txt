  from an email i received yesterday i don t understand why you are so convinced romney cannot win a general election _meta_end_dot_

 rasmussen has had a couple of polls out in the last couple of months that actually have him slightly ahead of hillary _meta_end_dot_

 and even the usa today gallup poll had him well within striking distance only down _meta_number_ref_ or _meta_number_ref_ i think _meta_end_dot_

 you talk about some polls that have him tied in states mccain wins by _meta_number_ref_ points but thats explained by name i d _meta_end_dot_

 at this early stage in the game _meta_end_dot_

 look at it this way if romney won fl and wrapped up on super tuesday who do you think the american people will enjoy looking at for nine months mitt and his family or hillary and bill _meta_end_question_

 i knno he probably will not have the appeal to indies and mods that mccain would but i just simply don t understand why you say he can t win in the general _meta_end_question_

 p s i m not a mitt supporter was a fredhead but am now just setting back watching it play out i m just asking a question to something i don t entirely get your reasoning behind and wish you d elaborate varnell ii william michael let me explain in more detail why i don t think mitt can win a general election _meta_end_dot_

 hillary and obama have a lot of flaws but given the mood of the country bush s job approval rating and the unhappiness of the republican base the democratic candidate will have a strong wind at their back in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 so it is going to be a tough environment for whoever the gop candidate ultimately turns out to be _meta_end_dot_

 with that in mind let s take a harder look at mitt _meta_end_dot_

 to begin with there is of course the mormon issue which i ll recap with an excerpt from a column i wrote that covered the subject like most americans i would happily walk into the voting booth and cast a vote for a mormon to be president of the united states _meta_end_dot_

 unfortunately a significant block of americans who consider mormons to be part of a heretical christian cult rightly or wrongly won t vote a mormon into the white house _meta_end_dot_

 for example a los angeles times bloomberg poll back in june of _meta_number_ref_ found that _meta_number_ref_ percent of americans said that they would not vote for a mormon presidential candidate similarly in a february of _meta_number_ref_ usa today poll _meta_percent_ref_ of american adults flat out said that they would not vote for a mormon who ran for the presidency _meta_end_dot_

 those numbers which are none too cheery for mitt backers become even more grim when you consider the very real possibility that many of the people who say that they won t vote for a mormon may be christians who typically vote republican but won t cast their vote for someone whom they consider to be part of a cult _meta_end_dot_

 this survey of christians at christianet com would seem to support that theory _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_percent_ref_ of the _meta_number_ref_ christians surveyed claimed they would not vote to elect a mormon for president so _meta_percent_ref_ to _meta_percent_ref_ of the public and perhaps a higher percentage of christians say that they won t vote for a mormon president _meta_end_dot_

 let s assume that _meta_percent_ref_ of them when confronted with a choice between mitt romney and let s say hillary clinton will change their mind and vote for him _meta_end_dot_

 given the political environment and the closeness of the last two elections can we still get a republican elected if roughly _meta_number_ref_ _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_percent_ref_ of the population decides that they won t even consider voting for mitt because of his religion _meta_end_question_

 fair unfair right wrong it is what it is _meta_end_dot_

 i have brown hair but if _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_percent_ref_ of the general public said they wouldn t vote for someone with brown hair i would counsel caution about running someone with brown hair _meta_end_dot_

 next up i would note that i think that in an effort to capture the republican nomination mitt has ended up getting the worst of both worlds _meta_end_dot_

 by that i mean that he was originally billed as a northerner who could help the gop win states that it wasn t able to capture in the last two elections _meta_end_dot_

 but in order to win mitt has shifted a lot of positions to try to come across as more of a conventional conservative _meta_end_dot_

 the upshot of this is that a lot conservatives doubt his bona fides while simultaneously he has moved far enough to the right to cease appealing to more moderate and independent voters who might help him capture blue states _meta_end_dot_

 what this has led to is weak numbers for mitt everywhere but particularly in southern states where there are more evangelical christians and where the fact that he s a slick northerner from massachusetts really works against him _meta_end_dot_

 now i will grant you that it s very early and that the polling numbers will obviously change a lot between now and november of this year _meta_end_dot_

 additionally mitt probably is at a bit of a disadvantage compared to people like john mccain and hillary clinton who have near universal name recognition _meta_end_dot_

 that being said the head to head polling that has been done does have some relevance and as you re about to see mitt s numbers are absolutely horrible _meta_end_dot_

 what i m going to do is show you some surveyusa head to head polling data that features john mccain mike huckabee and mitt romney all going up against hillary clinton _meta_end_dot_

 i m including mccain because he currently and consistently for that matter has the best republican numbers by far and i am including huckabee because he should have similar probably weaker actually name recognition to mitt _meta_end_dot_

 i m not going to include every poll and they haven t polled everywhere either but i think this will be a representative sample that will give you a good idea of romney s strength _meta_end_dot_

 clinton _meta_percent_ref_ huckabee _meta_percent_ref_ vs _meta_end_dot_

 clinton _meta_percent_ref_ what you ll notice is that mccain actually looks very strong against hillary and takes states that kerry won in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 of course his numbers would likely drop as the msm turned against him and the conservative media refused to give him more than tepid support _meta_end_dot_

 on the other hand huckabee s initial numbers are significantly weaker than mccain s numbers _meta_end_dot_

 but he could possibly win using a strategy similar to the one bush used in _meta_number_ref_ and _meta_number_ref_ take the whole south and win just enough other crucial states to pull it out _meta_end_dot_

 it would definitely be an uphill battle though _meta_end_dot_

 then there is mitt who is weak everywhere and judging by how poor his numbers are in kentucky and missouri i suspect he would end up putting several southern states in jeopardy without putting a significant number of new states into play _meta_end_dot_

 now some people may just write these polls off because they re telling them something that they don t want to hear but the reality is that these numbers probably give you a very rough idea of about where each of these candidates would be when the general election campaign begins _meta_end_dot_

 in my opinion mitt would start out in a hole that would probably be too deep for him to ever climb out of given the political environment _meta_end_dot_

 maybe that s not the case _meta_end_dot_

 in fact if mitt is the nominee i certainly hope it won t be the case _meta_end_dot_

 but hope generally doesn t get you very far in politics _meta_end_dot_
