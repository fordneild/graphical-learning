  dahlia lithwick writes perceptively about how critical it is that litigants especially in family court feel they have been heard by the court last week in las vegas reno nev millionaire darren mack shocked the court by pleading guilty midtrial to killing his estranged wife charla in june _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 in the weeks before he murdered charla darren mack was frustrated and then enraged by judge weller s interim custody and support order which resulted in shared physical custody and the requirement that darren pay charla _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ per month in interim spousal support _meta_end_dot_

 darren didn t pay weller found him in contempt and darren declared bankruptcy _meta_end_dot_

 convinced that weller had made up his mind prior to coming to court didn t like him and no matter what he did weller would rule against him as a friend explained darren launched a crusade _meta_end_dot_

 mazoltuv borukhova was outraged by the oct _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ decision of sidney f _meta_end_dot_

 strauss a state supreme court judge in queens to transfer temporary primary custody to malakov evidently without a hearing _meta_end_dot_

 even if a judicial move like this sounds familiar courtesy of the britney spears _meta_number_ref_ hour legal cable extravaganza it s almost never done _meta_end_dot_

 judge strauss however switched custody because borukhova was allegedly not cooperating with supervised visitation _meta_end_dot_

 i ve come to suspect _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 that mack may have snapped because after years of feeling listened to in the family courts even when he lost he came across a judge who seemed to reach swift conclusions without always hearing him out _meta_end_dot_

 after he pleaded guilty last week mack went out of his way to thank judge herndon saying he appreciated the integrity the judge had shown throughout the murder trial _meta_end_dot_

 there is much that needs fixing in the family law system _meta_end_dot_

 but at least from the perspective of these two aggrieved parents the quickest fix seems to be a family court judge who schedules one more conference and presides over one more hearing and truly listens even when she thinks she s heard it all before _meta_end_dot_

 but in almost any case lithwick is right nothing nothing outrages litigants as much as the perception that the judge isn t listening has already made up his mind and isn t fair _meta_end_dot_

 thus i have found that many settlements objectively unreachable have been achievable when a judge or even a court appointed referee or other neutral spends quality time in his or her chambers at a judicial settlement conference _meta_end_dot_

 it is ideal if both sides will agree to a period where each litigant can have the judge to him or herself _meta_end_dot_

 all of a sudden it turns out that quite often it really isn t about the money when a person feels he has had his day however brief in court it says something about our litigation system and about the arrogation of power by the government through the courts that this is so often impossible to achieve _meta_end_dot_

 a large part of the complication comes from the increasing criminalization of almost every aspect of the family law system in the states as extensively written about by bloggers such as trudy schuett _meta_end_dot_

 it would be awful to contemplate that judges might start listening to these stories because it s dangerous for them not to _meta_end_dot_
