  could happen up here in canada where the free speech climate is frigid at the best of times _meta_end_dot_

 yes you read that correctly the canadian site is in trouble for re posting a _meta_number_ref_ year old article from worldnetdaily _meta_end_exclamation_

 all it takes is one dedicated trouble making do gooder and a website s owners can be brought to court _meta_end_dot_

 you can make a nice bundle of cash doing this and it is all at taxpayer expense and at the expense of those you are suing _meta_end_dot_

 don t feel immune my american friends _meta_end_dot_

 freedom of speech is allegedly protected by law up here too _meta_end_dot_

 riiiiiight _meta_end_dot_

 at least kelo aside you have private property rights according to our charter we don t the difference between canadians and americans is that we canadians are generally too timid to fight back against this sort of intimidation _meta_end_dot_

 we also don t have organizations like you do such as the thomas more law center that represent people being bullied by the pc police _meta_end_dot_

 our conservative infrastructure is non existent _meta_end_dot_

 no heritage foundation no nothing our only conservative magazine folded last month _meta_end_dot_

 please pray for the few of us who are trying to preserve the freedoms we have left at the risk of personal bankruptcy if we are sued or brought before one of the unelected commissions in charge of keeping us in line _meta_end_dot_

 it is a trying exhausting and lonely time _meta_end_dot_
