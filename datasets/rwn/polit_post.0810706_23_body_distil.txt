  here s a pic from the latest ron paul rally yes for reasons that are a bit hard to fathom they re still having ron paul rallies even though they look to be down to less than a hundred people at this point isn t it tragic that ron paul wasn t quite able to get over the hump and capture the gop nomination _meta_end_question_

 i mean wouldn t it be great to have nuts like sign guy at every republican function railing against the gold standard and the jews _meta_end_question_

 i guess the libertarian party will once again get to fight it out with the greens for the i hate the jews impeach bush crowd _meta_end_dot_

 lucky dogs _meta_end_exclamation_

 ps remember when andrew sullivan proved that he was every bit as much of a genius at political analysis as he is a conservative by writing this back in may of last year _meta_end_question_

 the conservative pundits are now referring to ron paul as a crackpot hannity predictably savaged him last night see above _meta_end_dot_

 the hewitt site has an image of a man in a tin foil hat dean barnett and hugh hewitt both call for removing paul from the debates when he has been the best thing about them so far _meta_end_dot_

 bill benett wants him out _meta_end_dot_

 i m getting the usual ridicule for taking him seriously from the usual gop apparatchiks _meta_end_dot_

 they re scared aren t they _meta_end_question_

 the internet polls show real support for him _meta_end_dot_

 fox news own internet poll placed him a close second with _meta_number_ref_ percent of the votes from fox news viewers _meta_end_dot_

 we have a real phenomenon here inexplicably the man who scared the usual gop apparatchiks didn t quite prove to be the phenomenon andrew thought he was _meta_end_dot_

 guess those internet polls that showed real support for ron paul weren t quite as reliable as andrew thought _meta_end_dot_
