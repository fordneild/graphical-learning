  at some point or another i bet we have all played the whisper a rumor game _meta_end_dot_

 that s where you start with some sort of legitimate story whisper it to one person who repeats it to another and so on around the circle till it gets back to you and you get to marval how much it has changed _meta_end_dot_

 i think kevin drum has been playing as he somehow ends up with this you and your cell _meta_end_dot_

 all modern cell phones are equipped with gps capability that allows your location to be tracked within a few meters at all times _meta_end_dot_

 question does the federal government have access to this tracking information without a warrant _meta_end_question_

 the aclu filed a freedom of information request to find out but the feds refused to respond _meta_end_dot_

 so now they ve joined with the eff and filed a lawsuit they do _meta_end_question_

 they are all equipped with gps capability _meta_end_question_

 damn _meta_end_exclamation_

 that s news to me _meta_end_dot_

 i rarely mention my business but i have been in wireless since _meta_number_ref_ and let me tell you if they all had gps capability we would be using it to make money such as marketing it to parents to keep track of their kids and employers to keep track of their employees _meta_end_dot_

 i know of one employee at another carrier who was toasted by gps though _meta_end_dot_

 however it was because of the tracker on the company vehicle not the phone _meta_end_dot_

 what can be done is track by tower and pinpoint reasonably close depending on certain factors _meta_end_dot_

 so somehow in the overblown world of liberals this the aclu filed the foia request in november following media reports that federal officials were using americans cellular phones to pinpoint their locations without a warrant or any court oversight the groups said _meta_end_dot_

 some government officials at the time said they did not need probable cause to obtain tracking information from mobile phones _meta_end_dot_

 in addition the reports said some federal law enforcement agents had obtained tracking data from wireless carriers without any court oversight _meta_end_dot_

 became all modern cell phone are equipped with gps capability it s the same kind of weirdness and wackiness otherwise known here in the sphere as barking moonbat syndrome that led to trutherism bush wanting to kill all black people in new orleans and the belief that giving phone call info to the government that included only phone numbers was domestic spying _meta_end_dot_

 among their thousands of conspiracy theories _meta_end_dot_

 as a sidebar it is funny that liberals want to invest enormous amounts of power in the hands of the federal government which is full of liberals then have coniptions when that power supposedly corrupts _meta_end_dot_

 stop the aclu says not to jump on the paranoia bandwagon just yet _meta_end_dot_

 too late _meta_end_exclamation_

 american street says a warrant is not needed and explains _meta_end_dot_

 a j _meta_end_dot_

 strata the hyper paranoid liberal chatter today is all about who owns the location of your phones especially cell phones _meta_end_dot_

 he goes much deeper into a subject that because i work in the industry i wasn t going to touch _meta_end_dot_
