  question i don t know about you but it seems lately that my dollars are purchasing less and less these days and i feel it everytime i have to pump gas into my car or purchase goods from the local wal mart _meta_end_dot_

 i m not getting a raise this year because my company is not making any money and it doesn t help that we are in the middle of an election cycle and people are worried because they don t know the direction the country will take and saving their money _meta_end_dot_

 what do you think john _meta_end_question_

 are we headed for a recession or worse scorched_earth answer the economy has been running strong since mid _meta_number_ref_ and yet we ve had people predicting a recession practically the whole time _meta_end_dot_

 will we have a recession in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_question_

 maybe _meta_end_dot_

 even a broken clock is right twice a day _meta_end_dot_

 additionally there are credible predictions that the economy is going to slow down even if we don t go into recession _meta_end_dot_

 so growth does look likely to slow down _meta_end_dot_

 we ll just have to see if it plays out that way _meta_end_dot_
