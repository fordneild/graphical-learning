  we get in this kind of a circular firing squad on immigration reform in the congress of the united states and the lesson i learned from it is we ve got to have comprehensive immigration reform john mccain despite the fact that john mccain has spent months saying that he learned his lesson from the immigration debacle absolutely nobody seems to believe him when he says that he s going to secure the border before pursuing an amnesty _meta_end_dot_

 so when he says something like the above quote which i expect to see frantic clarifying press releases from his campaign on later today it just reinforces the impression that everyone already has you can t believe what he has to say about immigration _meta_end_dot_

 ps could this be mccain floating a trial balloon _meta_end_question_

 could he be getting ready to openly switch back to a pro comprehensive immigration position _meta_end_question_

 that s possible because i think that s what mccain really wants to do in his heart of hearts but i doubt if he ll go through with it _meta_end_dot_

 i mean even george bush sr _meta_end_dot_

 didn t break his read my lips no new taxes pledge until after he got elected _meta_end_dot_

 if mccain were to support any sort of comprehensive immigration bill at this point after spending months on the campaign trail saying we need security before a path to citizenship it would torpedo his presidential run and deservedly so _meta_end_dot_
