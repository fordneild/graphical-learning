 _meta_number_ref_ was sponsored by senator mark pryor democrat of arkansas _meta_end_dot_

 with over _meta_number_ref_ channels and video streaming parents could use a little help monitoring what their kids watch when they are not in the room pryor said in a press statement following the passage on wednesday _meta_end_dot_

 today s technology to protect children from indecency goes above and beyond the capabilities of the v chip _meta_end_dot_

 it s time for the fcc to take a fresh look at how the market can empower parents with more tools to choose appropriate programming for their children the text of the bill notes that the average child watches four hours of television a day _meta_end_dot_

 it also observes that _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ percent of all consumer complaints logged by the federal communications commission in the first quarter of _meta_number_ref_ regarding radio and television broadcasting were because of obscenity indecency and profanity many of those complaints are controversial it should be noted because they come from web based autoforms that allow people who have not actually seen a program to file a complaint _meta_end_dot_

 well _meta_end_dot_

 i ve complained not to the fcc but on my own personal bloggy soap box about advertising and content thrown into the middle of shows aimed at families nfl football games or the dancing shows for example _meta_end_dot_

 do i want more rules like this to find ways to censor _meta_end_question_

 the problem is that i m usually sitting right there during this programming but the ads come on so quickly that the image is already in my kid s head the news blurbs are the worst and would ostensibly not qualify for censorship _meta_end_dot_

 the only answer is just turning the whole thing off _meta_end_dot_

 right about now i m just not in the mood to have the government creating another law to make my life better _meta_end_dot_

 they need to stop legislating on this crap and stick with building the military and rebuilding america s infrastructure _meta_end_dot_

 all the rest of this legislative nonsense is not their business _meta_end_dot_
