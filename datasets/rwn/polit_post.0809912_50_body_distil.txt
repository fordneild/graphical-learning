  as you read this grotesque story ask yourself a key question why is this wrong hint there is a very good answer by the way although it s one liberals will have trouble coming to grips with _meta_end_dot_

 john and jenny deaves reunited _meta_number_ref_ years after mr deaves separated from jenny s mother _meta_end_dot_

 jenny was _meta_number_ref_ and just two weeks after meeting father and daughter had sex _meta_end_dot_

 john and i are in this relationship as consenting adults mrs deaves told the nine network s _meta_number_ref_ minutes tonight _meta_end_dot_

 we are just asking for a little bit of respect and understanding their nine month old daughter celeste shown on tv appears fit and healthy _meta_end_dot_

 mrs deaves said soon after reuniting with her father she began to see him as a man first and her father second _meta_end_dot_

 i was looking at him sort of going oh he s not too bad she said _meta_end_dot_

 like you might look at a man across the bar at a nightclub mrs deaves brought two children samantha and alex into the relationship after splitting from her former partner _meta_end_dot_

 mr deaves admitted that he initially thought having sex with his daughter was wrong _meta_end_dot_

 now why did i ask why is this wrong at the start of this post _meta_end_question_

 because if you buy into a lot of the silliness that is passed off as a common sense wisdom by the left you d almost be forced to give the thumbs up to this abomination in order to be consistent _meta_end_dot_

 for example haven t we been told that what goes on in the privacy of the bedroom is none of the government s business _meta_end_question_

 what about anything that two consenting adults do in the privacy of their own homes should be allowable _meta_end_question_

 oh here s a good one you can t legislate morality _meta_end_dot_

 but guess what _meta_end_question_

 sometimes you can and should legislate morality the government does on occasion at least belong in a bedroom and no anything that two consenting adults want to do to each other shouldn t necessarily be okay _meta_end_dot_

 could you just say that it s wrong because it s gross _meta_end_question_

 well only if to be morally consistent we re going to start banning everything that s gross _meta_end_dot_

 but does that make sense _meta_end_question_

 there are lots of gross things people can do that aren t illegal _meta_end_dot_

 so using grossness as an excuse simply doesn t cut it _meta_end_dot_

 what about the fact that birth defects could be caused by incest _meta_end_question_

 that s easily correctable birth defects could be prevented by extending to sibling marriage the rule that five states already apply to cousin marriage you can do it if you furnish proof of infertility or are presumptively too old to procreate _meta_end_dot_

 so why should adult incest be illegal _meta_end_question_

 simple _meta_end_dot_

 the answer is because it s immoral and yes that requires putting one set of morals above others and making laws based on those morals _meta_end_dot_

 that s why adult incest is and should remain illegal _meta_end_dot_

 it s also the primary reason why gay marriage polygamy bestiality prostitution and numerous other ills should remain illegal and people should remember that _meta_end_dot_

 once you torpedo the idea of basing laws at least in part on a moral code you are on your way to opening up a pandora s box of horrors for society to deal with _meta_end_dot_
