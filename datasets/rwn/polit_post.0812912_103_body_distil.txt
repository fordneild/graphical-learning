  it has long been noted that conservatives are happier people than liberals and here s the latest scientific explanation of why that is regardless of marital status income or church attendance right wing individuals reported greater life satisfaction and well being than left wingers the new study found _meta_end_dot_

 conservatives also scored highest on measures of rationalization which gauge a person s tendency to justify or explain away inequalities _meta_end_dot_

 the rationalization measure included statements such as it is not really that big a problem if some people have more of a chance in life than others and this country would be better off if we worried less about how equal people are to justify economic inequalities a person could support the idea of meritocracy in which people supposedly move up their economic status in society based on hard work and good performance _meta_end_dot_

 in that way one s social class attainment whether upper middle or lower would be perceived as totally fair and justified _meta_end_dot_

 if your beliefs don t justify gaps in status you could be left frustrated and disheartened according to the researchers jaime napier and john jost of new york university _meta_end_dot_

 they conducted a u s centric survey and a more internationally focused one to arrive at the findings _meta_end_dot_

 the results support and further explain a pew research center survey from _meta_number_ref_ in which _meta_number_ref_ percent of conservative republicans in the u s _meta_end_dot_

 described themselves as very happy while only _meta_number_ref_ percent of liberal democrats indicated such cheer _meta_end_dot_

 the same rationalizing phenomena could apply to personal situations as well _meta_end_dot_

 there is no reason to think that the effects we have identified here are unique to economic forms of inequality the researchers write _meta_end_dot_

 research suggests that highly egalitarian women are less happy in their marriages compared with their more traditional counterparts apparently because they are more troubled by disparities in domestic labor the current study was funded by the national science foundation _meta_end_dot_

 it s not called rationalization it s called a belief in personal responsibility and it s the biggest but not the only factor in being a happy person _meta_end_dot_

 people who take responsibility for their own lives and believe that other people need to do the same tend to be much happier people _meta_end_dot_

 why _meta_end_question_

 because if you have a problem you don t wait for someone else to fix it for you you take care of it yourself _meta_end_dot_

 similarly if someone else has a problem you may try to help him out because you re a decent person but ultimately you feel like it s his responsibility _meta_end_dot_

 not only is taking responsibility empowering it s much more in line with how the world really works _meta_end_dot_

 that s because the government is slow stupid and inefficient while other people and countries are much more interested in themselves than you _meta_end_dot_

 so if you blame other people for how your life is turning out or wait for other people to solve your problems you re disempowering yourself and setting yourself up to have an unhappy life _meta_end_dot_

 ps this may be a bit unintuitive to some people but it s also people who believe in personal responsibility who tend to do more good in the world and give more to charity yes studies show that conservatives are not just happier they give more _meta_end_dot_

 why is that _meta_end_question_

 because if you take personal responsibility and get your own life together you are in a position to contribute to others if you so desire you feel like it s your personal responsibility to help and you have more compassion for people who are struggling because you have done it yourself to succeed _meta_end_dot_
