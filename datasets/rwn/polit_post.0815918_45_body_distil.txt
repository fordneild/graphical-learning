  after being forty five minutes late hillary made the speech we all knew she was going to make _meta_end_dot_

 she officially suspended her campaign and threw her support behind barack obama _meta_end_dot_

 hillary rodham clinton ended her historic campaign for the presidency on saturday and told supporters to unite behind rival barack obama closing out a race that was as grueling as it was groundbreaking _meta_end_dot_

 the former first lady who as recently as tuesday declared herself the strongest candidate gave obama an unqualified endorsement and pivoted from her role as determined foe to absolute ally _meta_end_dot_

 the way to continue our fight now to accomplish the goals for which we stand is to take our energy our passion our strength and do all we can to help elect barack obama the next president of the united states she said in a speech before cheering supporters packed into the ornate national building museum not far from the white house she longed to govern from _meta_end_dot_

 today as i suspend my campaign i congratulate him on the victory he has won and the extraordinary campaign he has won _meta_end_dot_

 i endorse him and throw my full support behind him and i ask of you to join me in working as hard for barack obama as you have for me the new york senator said in her _meta_number_ref_ minute address _meta_end_dot_

 with that and _meta_number_ref_ other mentions of his name clinton placed herself solidly behind her senate colleague from illinois a political sensation and the first black to secure a presidential nomination _meta_end_dot_

 for clinton and her supporters it was a poignant moment the end of an extraordinary run that began with an air of inevitability and certain victory _meta_end_dot_

 about _meta_number_ref_ million people voted for her it was the closest a woman has come to capturing a nomination _meta_end_dot_

 although we weren t able to shatter that highest hardest glass ceiling this time thanks to you it has about _meta_number_ref_ million cracks in it and the light is shining through like never before she said _meta_end_dot_

 indeed her speech repeatedly returned to the milestone her candidacy represented for women _meta_end_dot_

 she also acknowledged the unprecedented success of obama s candidacy _meta_end_dot_

 children today will grow up taking for granted that an african american or a woman can yes become the president of the united states she said _meta_end_dot_

 is the nominee _meta_end_dot_

 however hillary didn t actually concede _meta_end_dot_

 i don t know what the point of that move is as we all know that obama s the nominee but i guess she s hanging on to one tiny thread of hope that she might still get it _meta_end_dot_

 here s some of her speech the full transcript is here _meta_end_dot_

 this is just hillary trying to salvage her political career _meta_end_dot_

 she realizes that the presidency can still be hers in _meta_number_ref_ and that she needs to do a little ass kissing if she s going to have any hope of saving her chances _meta_end_dot_

 of course there was the expected girl power _meta_end_exclamation_

 angle _meta_end_dot_

 just because she didn t win the nomination didn t mean she s stopped being hillary she s still just as arrogant and elitist as she was before _meta_end_dot_

 this speech wasn t about being humble or gracious _meta_end_dot_

 it had nothing to do with barack obama it was all about hillary _meta_end_dot_

 it was reminding us all that she was a history maker too that she s a pioneer and a groundbreaker just like he is _meta_end_dot_

 gay patriotnoted that she didn t offer any kind of advice or encouragement about dealing with mccain which was interesting _meta_end_dot_

 and again that s because this speech was all about her not obama not democratic party unity but her _meta_end_dot_

 she also got going on the healthcare issue like with this troubling quote we all want a health care system that is universal high quality and affordable so that parents don t have to choose between care for themselves or their children or be stuck in dead end jobs simply to keep their insurance _meta_end_dot_

 this isn t just an issue for me _meta_end_dot_

 it is a passion and a cause and it is a fight i will continue until every single american is insured no exceptions and no excuses _meta_end_dot_

 john edward s playbook _meta_end_dot_

 anyway since we all know now for sure that barack obama is going to be the nominee conservatives and republicans need to brace themselves along with anyone else voting for mccain independents hillary supporters moderates disenfranchised democrats etc _meta_end_dot_

 when barack was announced as the nominee the world media started hyperventilating about how historic this is and how ground breaking and unbelievable his clinching the nomination is and so on and so forth _meta_end_dot_

 so ready yourself because we ve got one hell of a battle ahead of us _meta_end_dot_

 every ad aired against obama will be deemed racist _meta_end_dot_

 condemnation of any of his policies will make you a racist _meta_end_dot_

 questioning any of obama s voting records past remarks charitable donations and earmarks and associations will make you a racist _meta_end_dot_

 you ll be accused of being too small minded and racist to be willing to support a black man for president _meta_end_dot_

 it will be all about obama and the fact that he s half black all the time and we will get smeared and attacked every day that we fight to try to defeat him _meta_end_dot_

 the very fact that we will try to keep him from being elected will get us labeled as racists _meta_end_dot_

 when mccain and obama debate mccain will likely be attacked and excoriated for criticizing obama in any way shape or fashion _meta_end_dot_

 he ll be called a bully and will be accused of using questionable and unethical tactics like swift boating _meta_end_dot_

 instead of being lauded in the press for being a maverick he ll be excommunicated as just another cog in the republican hate filled racism machine _meta_end_dot_

 here s what s especially troubling _meta_end_dot_

 if barack obama loses it will make bush derangement syndrome look like a bush lovefest _meta_end_dot_

 the media will erupt in indignation angrily shouting about how racists stole the election how mccain is a racist for riding the backs of racist americans to victory and how america is still filled with racism for not electing a half black man president _meta_end_dot_

 see with liberals it s never about policies _meta_end_dot_

 it s always about superficialities _meta_end_dot_

 the whole point of bringing this up is to be able to arm yourself _meta_end_dot_

 be prepared because we all know that this is what is coming and we need to be ready for the assault _meta_end_dot_

 no matter how civil we try to make this fight no matter how careful we are this is what we will be accused of and we can t let it scare us _meta_end_dot_

 the media will try to intimidate voters into supporting obama and we ve got to be prepared to stand up to it _meta_end_dot_
