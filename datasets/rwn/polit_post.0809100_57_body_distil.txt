  shannon love obama s close association with rev _meta_end_dot_

 wright may have destroyed his political ambitions by undermining the perception that he is a new kind of african american politician who does not see white americans as evil _meta_end_dot_

 it called into question the sincerity of his views about the majority of americans and american institutions _meta_end_dot_

 how can he represent protect and lead the white americans that his long time minister confidant and mentor sees as evil people leftist african americans like rev _meta_end_dot_

 wright take it as axiomatic that they cannot trust white americans due to their evil and corrupt nature _meta_end_dot_

 yet they seem puzzled and angered that white americans do not trust them in return _meta_end_dot_

 trust is a two way street _meta_end_dot_

 to be trusted one must give trust _meta_end_dot_

 let us hope that one day those on the left learn that lesson _meta_end_dot_

 this is simply a lack of sensitivity disguised as fairness _meta_end_dot_

 it is different when you are the majority _meta_end_dot_

 you can be teased _meta_end_dot_

 you can be the butt of jokes _meta_end_dot_

 it is not really offensive to be made fun of for being white and the people pretending offense know this _meta_end_dot_

 the concept that people are wicked for being who they are is not only ironic when applied by blacks once considered by some satanic themselves simply because of their negritude _meta_end_dot_

 it is not only morally and logically unsupportable _meta_end_dot_

 it is a loser of an argument _meta_end_dot_
