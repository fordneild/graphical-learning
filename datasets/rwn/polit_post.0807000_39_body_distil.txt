  y ou know all those green energy jobs clinton and obama love to go on about _meta_end_question_

 well here s a plac e where those green jobs aren t particularly doing the environment any favors the first time li gengxuan saw the dump trucks from the nearby factory pull into his village he couldn t believe what happened _meta_end_dot_

 stopping between the cornfields and the primary school playground the workers dumped buckets of bubbling white liquid onto the ground _meta_end_dot_

 then they turned around and drove right back through the gates of their compound without a word _meta_end_dot_

 this ritual has been going on almost every day for nine months li and other villagers said _meta_end_dot_

 in china a country buckling with the breakneck pace of its industrial growth such stories of environmental pollution are not uncommon _meta_end_dot_

 but the luoyang zhonggui high technology co here in the central plains of henan province near the yellow river stands out for one reason it s a green energy company producing polysilicon destined for solar energy panels sold around the world _meta_end_dot_

 but the byproduct of polysilicon production silicon tetrachloride is a highly toxic substance that poses environmental hazards _meta_end_dot_

 obviously we re unlikely to see a scenario like the above unfold here _meta_end_dot_

 but the point of all this is for most of these technologies there are trade offs in byproducts and pollutants which can be very toxic and difficult to dispose of _meta_end_dot_

 in the case of silicon tetrachloride the land where you dump or bury it will be infertile _meta_end_dot_

 no grass or trees will grow in the place _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 it is like dynamite it is poisonous it is polluting _meta_end_dot_

 human beings can never touch it said ren bingyan a professor at the school of material sciences at hebei industrial university _meta_end_dot_

 i m sure there s an approved method of handling and disposing of silicon tetrachloride and i m pretty sure it is expensive _meta_end_dot_

 and unless companies choose to dispose of it as the luoyang zhonggui high technology company tried to do consumers are going to pay for it in expensive energy saving devices _meta_end_dot_

 this example goes to the question that should be asked of all supposed green technologies _meta_end_dot_

 what in terms of pollutants and toxic waste is produced in the production of the technology _meta_end_question_

 ethanol for instance may use more energy than it produces simply because of the existing production process it requires and the fact that it cannot be transported by pipeline but must be trucked to and from the refinery _meta_end_dot_

 and photovoltaic cells which the company cited above was manufacturing _meta_end_question_

 well at the moment they re not the most efficient method of generating energy _meta_end_dot_

 a squared meter of panels will power _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ watt lightbulbs _meta_end_dot_

 william tucker author of terrestrial energy how a nuclear solar alliance can rescue the planet points out that the solar panels necessary to power one suburban home would require an array about half the size of a football field and cost in the neighborhood of _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 that s not exactly a short term roi when compared to traditional forms of energy generation _meta_end_dot_

 that s not to say that solar panels aren t an important part of a total energy solution but in reality they ll be a small part _meta_end_dot_

 same with wind _meta_end_dot_

 according to tucker because of the unpredictability of wind recently demonstrated in texas only _meta_percent_ref_ of any grid s power can be wind driven because that is the most a grid can mask by other sources should wind fail _meta_end_dot_

 and then there s the eye pollution arrays of giant windmills bring ask ted kennedy _meta_end_dot_

 there s no question that coal isn t the most pollutant free way to produce energy _meta_end_dot_

 but it is the cheapest _meta_end_dot_

 we burn _meta_number_ref_ billion tons of coal a year up from _meta_number_ref_ million in _meta_number_ref_ and it produces _meta_number_ref_ percent of our greenhouse gases and _meta_number_ref_ percent of the world s total carbon emissions _meta_end_dot_

 tucker points out that an average _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ megawatt coal plant uses a railroad car load of coal to provide _meta_number_ref_ minutes of electricity _meta_end_dot_

 i know you re wondering where in the hell is he going with this _meta_end_dot_

 well it s to familiar territory and you should have gotten the hint in the title of tucker s book _meta_end_dot_

 good old reliable clean nuclear energy _meta_end_dot_

 here s how tucker describes the contrast between that _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ watt coal plant at which a train with _meta_number_ref_ cars each loaded with _meta_number_ref_ tons of coal arrives every _meta_number_ref_ days _meta_end_dot_

 at a _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ megawatt nuclear plant every two years a fleet of flatbed trucks pulls up to the reactor to deliver a load of fuel rods _meta_end_dot_

 these rods are only mildly radioactive and can be handled with gloves _meta_end_dot_

 they will be loaded into a reactor where they will remain for six years only _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ of the rods are replaced at each refueling _meta_end_dot_

 the replaced rods will be removed and transferred to a storage pool inside the containment structure where they can remain indefinitely three feet of water blocks the radiation _meta_end_dot_

 there is no exhaust no carbon emissions no sulfur sludge to be carted away hourly and heaped into vast dumps _meta_end_dot_

 there is no release into the environment _meta_end_dot_

 the fuel rods come out looking exactly as they did going in except they are now more highly radioactive _meta_end_dot_

 there is no air pollution no water pollution no ground pollution in other words if obama and clinton want to create green energy jobs their top priority should be seeing how many nuclear power plants they can bring on line in a _meta_number_ref_ year period assuming either of them ever get the chance _meta_end_dot_
