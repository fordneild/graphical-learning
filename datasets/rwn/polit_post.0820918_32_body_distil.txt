  i m not really one for doing reviews particularly book reviews _meta_end_dot_

 typically i will dive into a new book before i can even get around to writing a review but i have found the new book by harry turtledove the man with the iron heart rather interesting _meta_end_dot_

 via amazon what if v e day didn t end world war ii in europe _meta_end_question_

 what if instead the allies had to face a potent even fanatical postwar nazi resistance _meta_end_question_

 such a movement based in the fabled alpine redoubt was in fact a real threat ultimately neutralized by germany s flagging resources and squabbling officials _meta_end_dot_

 but had ss obergruppenf hrer reinhard heydrich the notorious man with the iron heart not been assassinated in _meta_number_ref_ fate might have taken a different turn _meta_end_dot_

 we might likely have seen a german guerrilla war launched against the conquerors presaging by more than half a century the protracted conflict with an unrelenting enemy that now engulfs the united states and its allies in iraq _meta_end_dot_

 how might today s clash of troops versus terrorists have played out in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_question_

 in this imagined world nazi forces resort to unconventional warfare using the quick and dirty tactics of terrorism booby traps time bombs mortar and rocket strikes in the night assassinations even kamikaze style suicide attacks to overturn what seemed to be a decisive allied victory _meta_end_dot_

 in november _meta_number_ref_ a truck bomb blows up the nuremberg palace of justice where high ranking nazi officials are about to stand trial for war crimes _meta_end_dot_

 none of the accused are there when the bomb goes off but their judges all of them present and accounted for are annihilated _meta_end_dot_

 worse acts of terrorism follow all over europe _meta_end_dot_

 suddenly the allies especially the united states must battle an invisible enemy and sacrifice countless lives in a long seemingly pointless unwinnable conflict _meta_end_dot_

 on the home front patriotism corrodes political fortunes are made and lost in the face of an antiwar backlash and a once proud country wonders how the righteous fight for freedom overseas has collapsed into a hopeless quagmire _meta_end_dot_

 at once a novel of thrilling military suspense intriguing alternate history and profound insight into contemporary affairs the man with the iron heart is a tour de force by a storyteller of exceptional imaginative power i guess i am still not really doing a book review beyond saying it is a very interesting comparison to what is and has been going on in and because of iraq _meta_end_dot_

 most of the characters are not the nutters we see on the left _meta_end_dot_

 one of the main get out of germany characters is a mother who lost her son after ve day and is certainly saner then the one we had running around till the liberals decided her _meta_number_ref_ minutes was up and threw her off a mountian side _meta_end_dot_

 the book portrays both sides of the argument effectively and rationally with only some of the hyper partisanship we have been seeing _meta_end_dot_

 granted it is not turtledove s finest about average for him _meta_end_dot_

 but if you like turtledove and or alternative historical scifi you will not be disappointed _meta_end_dot_

 i do not know how it ends about _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_rds through so i guess i will see _meta_end_dot_
