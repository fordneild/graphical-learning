  if you listen to liberals they ll tell you that conservatives are angry homophobic racist misogynist people which is why the time i spent surfing through the liberal blogosphere this morning was so surprising well it would be surprising if i didn t already realize that liberals have a tendency to project their more unsavory beliefs and attitudes onto conservatives _meta_end_dot_

 go back and read what would probably be a typical liberal description of conservatives in the first sentence of the post angry homophobic racist misogynist people and now read this list of liberal blogs which i put together by perusing just _meta_number_ref_ or _meta_number_ref_ different blogrolls _meta_end_dot_

 angry indian angryblackb tch angry old b tch angrybrownbutch b tch magazine b tch ph d _meta_end_dot_

 dyked out dykes and the city the field negro godless liberal homo negrophile quarterlife queer teh portly dyke the angry black woman the g b tch spot the infuriated f ggot the skepb tch and this doesn t even get into the profane and stupid content it s just the names of the blogs _meta_end_dot_

 in fact take a random vulgarity add it to a racial or gender group and throw the word angry out there in front of it if you re so inclined and you ve just probably named another liberal blog _meta_end_dot_

 ps and this isn t even including the countless feminist gender blogs out there _meta_end_dot_

 whatever happened to being an individual instead of part of some identity group _meta_end_question_

 also better question whatever happened to class on the left _meta_end_question_
