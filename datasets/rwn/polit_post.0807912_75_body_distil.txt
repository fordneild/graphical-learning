 prisoner on a leash from abu ghraib is out of prison and causing a stir lynndie england the public face of the abu ghraib prison scandal told a german news magazine that she was sorry for appearing in photographs of detainees in the notorious iraqi prison and believes the scenes of torture and humiliation served as a powerful rallying point for anti american insurgents _meta_end_dot_

 in an interview with the weekly magazine stern conducted in english and posted on its web site tuesday england was both remorseful and unrepentant and conceded that the published photos surely incensed insurgents in iraq _meta_end_dot_

 i guess after the picture came out the insurgency picked up and iraqis attacked the americans and the british and they attacked in return and they were just killing each other _meta_end_dot_

 i felt bad about it _meta_end_dot_

 no i felt pissed off _meta_end_dot_

 if the media hadn t exposed the pictures to that extent then thousands of lives would have been saved she was quoted as saying _meta_end_dot_

 asked how she could blame the media for the controversy she said it wasn t her who leaked the photos _meta_end_dot_

 yeah i took the photos but i didn t make it worldwide _meta_end_dot_

 yes i was in five or six pictures and i took some pictures and those pictures were shameful and degrading to the iraqis and to our government she said according to the report _meta_end_dot_

 and i feel sorry and wrong about what i did _meta_end_dot_

 but it would not have escalated to what it did all over the world if it wouldn t have been for someone leaking it to the media _meta_end_dot_

 england who was a private first class was in several images taken in late _meta_number_ref_ by u s _meta_end_dot_

 guards at abu ghraib _meta_end_dot_

 one showed her holding a naked prisoner on a leash while in others she posed with a pyramid of naked detainees and pointed at the genitals of a prisoner while a cigarette hung from the corner of her mouth first of all let me note that england s behavior at abu ghraib was completely inappropriate contrary to the way this country should treat prisoners and morally reprehensible _meta_end_dot_

 moreover the article notes she did _meta_number_ref_ months in jail for her part in the abu ghraib controversy _meta_end_dot_

 in my opinion she got off way too light _meta_end_dot_

 that being said if sixty minutes _meta_number_ref_ and the new yorker which forced their hand by planning to run the shots had put a higher priority on the good of their country than getting ratings they would have never put those pictures out _meta_end_dot_

 not just because of england but because of the media that released the pictures al qaeda got a great talking point to use against us our country s reputation took an unfair hit and thousands of people died in the violence those pictures helped gin up _meta_end_dot_

 if our mainstream media wasn t so sleazy and irresponsible those pics would have never seen the light of day _meta_end_dot_

 and what would the difference have been _meta_end_question_

 the military already had an investigation under way so england and the rest of the pervs at abu ghraib would have been punished and the prison would have been cleaned up _meta_end_dot_

 in other words the media sold their country out for the sake of ratings and to give the i hate america crowd on the left something to gripe about for a few months _meta_end_dot_

 if you want to know why the rich frothy loathing that the american people have for the mainstream press is completely justified the way the whole abu ghraib story was covered from the release of the pics in the first place to the way it was incredibly overplayed for months to the way it was used to smear america and the military is a telling example _meta_end_dot_
