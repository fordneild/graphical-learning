  a few days ago dr _meta_end_dot_

 roy spencer gave testimony before the senate environment and public works committee chaired by sen _meta_end_dot_

 barbara boxer _meta_end_dot_

 to say his testimony wasn t at all what she wanted to hear would be an understatement _meta_end_dot_

 highlights regarding the currently popular theory that mankind is responsible for global warming i am very pleased to deliver good news from the front lines of climate change research _meta_end_dot_

 our latest research results which i am about to describe could have an enormous impact on policy decisions regarding greenhouse gas emissions _meta_end_dot_

 despite decades of persistent uncertainty over how sensitive the climate system is to increasing concentrations of carbon dioxide from the burning of fossil fuels we now have new satellite evidence which strongly suggests that the climate system is much less sensitive than is claimed by the u n s intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc _meta_end_dot_

 another way of saying this is that the real climate system appears to be dominated by negative feedbacks instead of the positive feedbacks which are displayed by all twenty computerized climate models utilized by the ipcc _meta_end_dot_

 feedback parameters larger than _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ watts per square meter per degree kelvin wm _meta_number_ref_k _meta_number_ref_ indicate negative feedback while feedback parameters smaller than _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ indicate positive feedback at this point i can almost see boxer in my mind s eye swallowing her tongue _meta_end_dot_

 spencer has had his findings peer reviewed _meta_end_dot_

 in fact it was reviewed by some of those responsible for the computer models the ipcc used significantly prior to its acceptance for publication this paper was reviewed by two leading ipcc climate model experts piers forster and isaac held both of whom agreed that we have raised a legitimate issue _meta_end_dot_

 piers forster an ipcc report lead author and a leading expert on the estimation of climate sensitivity even admitted in his review of our paper that other climate modelers need to be made aware of this important issue _meta_end_dot_

 to be fair in a follow up communication piers forster stated to me his belief that the net effect of the new understanding on climate sensitivity estimates would likely be small _meta_end_dot_

 but as we shall see the latest evidence now suggests otherwise _meta_end_dot_

 it should be noted that spencer doesn t descend to the level of many of his opponents and call forster a denier or a heretic _meta_end_dot_

 unlike them apparently he has some confidence in the soundness of the science backing his position _meta_end_dot_

 obviously when that s the case there s no real reason to resort to that sort of nonsense is there _meta_end_question_

 spencer then goes into a detailed description of his findings that you can read an the link _meta_end_dot_

 somewhere in there i m almost positive boxer s eyes glazed over _meta_end_dot_

 spencer concludes with policy implications and says obviously what i am claiming today is of great importance to the global warming debate and related policy decisions and it will surely be controversial _meta_end_dot_

 these results are not totally unprecedented though as other recently published research has also led to the conclusion that the real climate system does not exhibit net positive feedback _meta_end_dot_

 while it will take some time for the research community to digest this new information it must be mentioned that new research contradicting the latest ipcc report is entirely consistent with the normal course of scientific progress _meta_end_dot_

 i predict that in the coming years there will be a growing realization among the global warming research community that most of the climate change we have observed is natural and that mankind s role is relatively minor _meta_end_dot_

 or shorter version you politicians need to sit back and relax until the science is is complete on this but there are indications enough to doubt the initial take on all of this and policy shouldn t be implemented that may be both costly and unnecessary _meta_end_dot_

 naturally congress which is up to its armpits in costly and unnecessary legislation is unlikely heed that warning unless enough of a ruckus is raised to make them _meta_end_dot_

 speaking of warnings spencer also says i hope that the committee realizes that if true these new results mean that humanity will be largely spared the negative consequences of human induced climate change _meta_end_dot_

 this would be good news that should be celebrated not attacked and maligned _meta_end_dot_

 and given that virtually no research into possible natural explanations for global warming has been performed it is time for scientific objectivity and integrity to be restored to the field of global warming research _meta_end_dot_

 this committee could at a minimum make a statement that encourages that goal _meta_end_dot_

 wow talk about shouting in the face of the wind _meta_end_dot_

 i think at this point you could probably hear a pin drop in the hearing room no celebration there _meta_end_dot_

 after all al gore wrote it they believe it and that settles it _meta_end_dot_

 amen _meta_end_dot_
