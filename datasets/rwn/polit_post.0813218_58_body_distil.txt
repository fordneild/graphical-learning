  my mom birthed me therefore i am _meta_end_dot_

 thanks mom _meta_end_exclamation_

 wait is it _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ cst _meta_end_question_

 why yes it is _meta_end_dot_

 i rolled my old bones out of bed an hour ago secure in the knowledge that i got to sleep in today _meta_end_dot_

 sleeping is just better when you know someone else is responsible for the urchins _meta_end_dot_

 a breakfast spread not in bed that mode of eating is overrated crumbs spilled stuff it s better in theory sat on the table _meta_end_dot_

 my little cherubs were there _meta_end_dot_

 the youngest one sans clothes _meta_end_dot_

 he s happier that way these days _meta_end_dot_

 i got a present _meta_end_dot_

 try to not be jealous _meta_end_dot_

 it s going to be hard because they re so freakin cool _meta_end_exclamation_

 the earphones made by etymotic research specially for my iphone cancel noise so i m not blasting my eardrums now turning the music up so dang loud to cancel external noise _meta_end_dot_

 they fit into my wee ear canal comfortably _meta_end_dot_

 my apple earphones hurt my ear and were falling apart after daily use since december _meta_end_dot_

 i endured the pain because _meta_number_ref_ i m cheap and _meta_number_ref_ my options sucked for so long _meta_end_dot_

 the benefits of the old apple earphones still outweighed the other two choices _meta_end_dot_

 with the apple earphones you could use the phone and i really really like the feature of uninterrupted music _meta_end_dot_

 that is i could receive a phone call or make one and the song i was listening to would fade out and then back in right where it was _meta_end_dot_

 the other headphones were either headphones or wireless blue tooth phone but not both phone and headphones _meta_end_dot_

 not now _meta_end_dot_

 the etymotic hf_meta_number_ref_ s do everything the old apple earphones do they just do it oh so much better _meta_end_dot_

 the sound is astonishingly good _meta_end_dot_

 rich and full nice bass mid tones good treble decent _meta_end_dot_

 sounds a bit tinny right now but i m listening to an old roy orbison recording of you got it so it might be that _meta_end_dot_

 now i m listening to prince s i would die for you _meta_end_dot_

 sounds the same _meta_end_dot_

 it s the earphones _meta_end_dot_

 but i m quibbling _meta_end_dot_

 they are fantastic _meta_end_dot_

 i accepted one phone call and experimented with going outside _meta_end_dot_

 a complaint about the apple headphones was that the microphone picked up every little sound _meta_end_dot_

 thus a breezy day negated talking on the phone outdoors with the headphones on a walk say requiring me to pull them out hold the headphones in one hand no clip the new ones have a clip and gab on the phone _meta_end_dot_

 i know _meta_end_dot_

 i suffer _meta_end_dot_

 we ll see if it s the same deal with the new ones _meta_end_dot_

 i don t know _meta_end_dot_

 during my one test run the caller could hear the birds chirping in the background so we ll see _meta_end_dot_

 if i was a good mother i d be waxing elephant about the inherent joys of motherhood first before telling you yahoos about the rocking headphones _meta_end_dot_

 but i never claimed to be a good mother _meta_end_dot_

 no award winning heroic deeds of self sacrifice this morning yet anyway to distinguish me from any other mother who does her loving duty day in and day out _meta_end_dot_

 i just love my kids _meta_end_dot_

 melissa clouthier my little toot ran up to me naked of course jumped into my arms and exclaimed i love you mama_meta_beep_ref_ well take my heart out and crush it in your little palm son _meta_end_dot_

 oof i just can t even describe the feeling that comes from hearing those words that way from that sweet little face _meta_end_dot_

 the headphones are choice but there is no comparison to those pink cheeks blue marble eyes and squeaky voice _meta_end_dot_

 we moms are complete suckers _meta_end_dot_

 it s that skin the sweetness the purity that helps us when five minutes later he is head butting me because i won t give him his third bowl of honey nut cheerios _meta_end_dot_

 motherhood is complex mundane routine surprising demanding relentless and really not for the faint of heart _meta_end_dot_

 until a woman is a mother herself she can t really comprehend her own mother s dedication and love _meta_end_dot_

 there aren t words for it really _meta_end_dot_

 it begins with the sacrifice of the body _meta_end_dot_

 i remember being astonished how consumed i was by being pregnant even when i was too busy to think about it _meta_end_dot_

 this little dot of a kid completely changed my biochemistry _meta_end_dot_

 my body responded to this alien invasion on autopilot but my life was no longer just mine _meta_end_dot_

 it became this other being s too _meta_end_dot_

 and the pregnancy was just the beginning of life giving _meta_end_dot_

 as time goes on that commitment and choice becomes even more apparent _meta_end_dot_

 you don t know what kind of kid you ll get _meta_end_dot_

 i expected that i d have no problems _meta_end_dot_

 of course when i got pregnant the notion of a deformed child or some birth defect subtly terrorized me hung out there as a looming possibility but i didn t really believe that would happen _meta_end_dot_

 and i thought the pregnancy would be fine _meta_end_dot_

 but i couldn t know _meta_end_dot_

 motherhood disabused me of the notion that i had control of my destiny _meta_end_dot_

 it was an illusion anyway _meta_end_dot_

 i thought i could make life conform to my whims _meta_end_dot_

 and to a certain extent i could but mostly i possessed the hubris that all young people have _meta_end_dot_

 that life will go on forever and that all mistakes can be corrected with work and time _meta_end_dot_

 i was wrong _meta_end_dot_

 my body betrayed me _meta_end_dot_

 it birthed the babies early and wanted to do the same with each successive pregnancy _meta_end_dot_

 we only know a little about why _meta_end_dot_

 there is always a why but there s not always a way to find the why _meta_end_dot_

 and then one of my sons died _meta_end_dot_

 and the other lived and suffered _meta_end_dot_

 and i was helpless to stop it or change anything _meta_end_dot_

 motherhood revealed the truth i am limited and am a conduit for life force but do not possess the power of life _meta_end_dot_

 that knowledge is self evident and of course i knew it intellectually before but i didn t know it in the way i knew it after the birth of my sons _meta_end_dot_

 i don t want to get all maudlin here that s not really my point _meta_end_dot_

 but i do think that a certain humility and self awareness comes with parenthood _meta_end_dot_

 suddenly life gets re prioritized _meta_end_dot_

 and all my fancy ideas and selfishness and self will and ideas about life got shot through the blender of reality and what s really important _meta_end_dot_

 and imagine my surprise _meta_end_exclamation_

 what was really important wasn t me well not every single second anyway _meta_end_dot_

 motherhood doesn t automatically make a person a selfless loving paragon of virtue _meta_end_dot_

 it didn t me that s for sure _meta_end_dot_

 it did expand my world beyond my own confined constraints _meta_end_dot_

 my heart expanded and i was made vulnerable _meta_end_dot_

 a hug from a naked gnome reveals my weakness and newfound strength too _meta_end_dot_

 my life is more focused and more full _meta_end_dot_

 i am chained and freed at the same time _meta_end_dot_

 the world needs more mothers and fathers _meta_end_dot_

 people making choices for the benefit of others over themselves _meta_end_dot_

 japan and europe die today because their citizens live like today is the last day _meta_end_dot_

 and they create a self fulfilling prophecy _meta_end_dot_

 why care about society lasting beyond this generation _meta_end_question_

 what is worth saving about it _meta_end_question_

 if you re a mother or a father the answer to that question is self evident _meta_end_dot_

 oh and one more thing _meta_end_exclamation_

 i had the earphones in the wrong ears _meta_end_dot_

 i switched them _meta_end_dot_

 the sound is even better _meta_end_exclamation_
