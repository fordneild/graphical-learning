  if you ever needed more proof that supporting the troops doesn t mean the same thing to the left and the right in this country then well honestly you haven t been paying much attention _meta_end_dot_

 but no worries this post from daily kos diarist acquittal should give you an idea of the sort of esteem that libs hold the military and for that matter our country in how to defeat military recruiters overwhelm them with decoys _meta_end_exclamation_

 i truly believe that antiwar activists should focus our energies on military recruitment _meta_end_dot_

 the empire will modify its militarism only if is does not have sufficient bodies and minds to run all its ongoing and contemplated wars _meta_end_dot_

 the best way to accomplish this is to overwhelm the recruitment system with decoy targets _meta_end_dot_

 antiwar persons especially youth should contact their local recruiter and express interest in learning about the career opportunities that exist for them in the us military _meta_end_dot_

 they can schedule appointments attend meetings take tests ask questions whatever _meta_end_dot_

 the whole point would be to waste the recruiters time and energy _meta_end_dot_

 an hour spent recruiting somebody who isn t intersted is an hour not spent recruiting somebody who is interested _meta_end_dot_

 i do not assert that military recruiters are the worst people on earth or anywhere near as bad as bush his cabinet or the ceo of halliburton only that recruiting is where the military corporate establishment is most vulnerable the achilles heel of the evil system the place where we should strike _meta_end_dot_

 that s pretty supportive of the troops isn t it _meta_end_question_

 trying to waste hours of their time and it s great to know that military recruiters aren t the worst people on earth they re just way up there on the scale i suppose _meta_end_dot_

 also we re an empire and an evil system that s really nice _meta_end_dot_

 keep talking like that buddy and you might end up in a barack obama administration someday _meta_end_dot_

 maybe they can put this guy in charge of recruiting for the military and disposing of flag pins _meta_end_dot_
