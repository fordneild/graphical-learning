  john stephenson has already done an excellent and comprehensive job of addressing barack obama s elitist comments on small town voters but i think one aspect of those remarks deserves a little extra examination _meta_end_dot_

 in obama s remarks this portion stuck out for me here s how it is in a lot of these communities in big industrial states like ohio and pennsylvania people have been beaten down so long and they feel so betrayed by government and when they hear a pitch that is premised on not being cynical about government then a part of them just doesn t buy it _meta_end_dot_

 and when it s delivered by it s true that when it s delivered by a _meta_number_ref_ year old black man named barack obama laugher then that adds another layer of skepticism laughter _meta_end_dot_

 but so the questions you re most likely to get about me well what is this guy going to do for me _meta_end_question_

 what s the concrete thing what they wanna hear is so we ll give you talking points about what we re proposing close tax loopholes roll back you know the tax cuts for the top _meta_number_ref_ percent _meta_end_dot_

 obama s gonna give tax breaks to middle class folks and we re gonna provide health care for every american _meta_end_dot_

 so we ll go down a series of talking points _meta_end_dot_

 former rep _meta_end_dot_

 bob barr thinks obama s comments reveal that he doesn t understand freedom as in the second amendment right to bear arms and the first amendment right to freedom of religion _meta_end_dot_

 that s probably true but more fundamentally obama realizes that government has done absolutely nothing to help the poor or middle class economically but his solution to that is not to turn to non governmental solutions to create wealth like say the free market but instead to try to use that same failed government to take wealth from one group of people and give it to another notice that in obama s latest remarks immediately after noting that people are cynical about government he proposes to close tax loopholes _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 to roll back tax cuts for the top _meta_number_ref_ percent that means increasing the amount of taxes taken from one group of high income people by the government he also proposes tax breaks for the middle class and health care for every american that s theoretically at least a direct transfer of wealth from high income earners to the middle class and poor of course the reality is that governmental agencies waste huge percentages of the revenues they collect due to civil service bureaucracy fraud poor planning lack of responsiveness to changing conditions people who learn to game the system and other forms of waste caused by lack of market incentives meanwhile the top _meta_percent_ref_ of earners whom obama proposes to soak already pay _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ percent of all federal individual income taxes just how much more does obama want to squeeze out of this group before they flee overseas _meta_end_question_

 obama doesn t understand or doesn t think it s in his interest to admit that free markets enrich everyone in a country be they rich or poor he doesn t understand the engine of america s prosperity in obama s mind the only way government can enrich poor people or even the middle class is by taking more and more from the rich of course if that theory were correct zimbabwe would be rich right now having taken away the farms from white people and redistributed them to farmless blacks how well did zimbabwe s redistribution of wealth work out not very _meta_end_dot_

 hyperinflation economic collapse mass emigration stores emptied of bread people beginning to starve and now a presidential regime that won t even release election results _meta_end_dot_

 obama s got only one tool in his toolbox and that tool is socialism also known as communism or communism lite either way far from enriching the poor obama would ensure that they remain destitute by reducing or destroying incentives to produce and to create and to innovate for both the rich and the poor why should the rich produce if their wealth is taken away why should the poor produce if they are given everything they need without having to lift a finger _meta_end_question_

 as john stephenson noted earlier glenn beck and mark steyn reached pretty much the same conclusion about obama s socialism looking at the dividing the pie comments of michelle obama this week watch this video jon linked to earlier via stop the aclu the conclusion is inescapable that obama is carrying forward his father s dreams and those dreams are socialist and communist in nature _meta_end_dot_

 as reported at prestopundit in a _meta_number_ref_ paper entitled problems facing our socialism obama s father advocated socialism in kenya _meta_number_ref_ obama advocated the communal ownership of land and the forced confiscation of privately controlled land as part of a forced development plan an important element of his attack on the government s advocacy of private ownership land titles and property registration _meta_end_dot_

 p _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ obama advocated the nationalization of european and asian owned enterprises including hotels with the control of these operations handed over to the indigenous black population _meta_end_dot_

 pp _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ note from gina cobb we see how well nationalizing assets of whites is working in zimbabwe _meta_number_ref_ obama advocated dramatically increasing taxation on the rich even up to the _meta_percent_ref_ level arguing that there is no limit to taxation if the benefits derived from public services by society measure up to the cost in taxation which they have to pay p _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ and that theoretically there is nothing that can stop the government from taxing _meta_percent_ref_ of income so long as the people get benefits from the government commensurate with their income which is taxed p _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ obama contrasts the ill defined and weak tea notion of african socialism negatively with the well defined ideology of scientific socialism i e _meta_end_dot_

 communism obama views african socialism pioneers like nkrumah nyerere and toure as having diverted only a little from the capitalist system _meta_end_dot_

 p _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ obama advocates an active rather than a passive program to achieve a classless society through the removal of economic disparities between black africans and asian and europeans _meta_end_dot_

 p _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ while we welcome the idea of a prevention of class problems we should try to cure what has slipped in _meta_end_dot_

 we _meta_end_dot_

 need to eliminate power structures that have been built through excessive accumulation so that not only a few individuals shall control a vast magnitude of resources as is the case now _meta_end_dot_

 so long as we maintain free enterprise one cannot deny that some will accumulate more than others _meta_end_dot_

 also recommended on this subject from earlier this week michelle will steal your pie _meta_end_dot_

 we have a bona fide socialist running for the presidency of the united states _meta_end_dot_

 will american voters be well informed enough to understand what this means _meta_end_question_

 will they understand that the audacity of hope leads to economic ruin _meta_end_question_
