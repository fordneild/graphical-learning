  republicans huckabee won in iowa but his victory didn t give him any sort of big boost in new hampshire where he finished a weak _meta_number_ref_rd _meta_end_dot_

 mccain finished in _meta_number_ref_th iowa and although he did win new hampshire by a decent margin hillary clinton s stunning come from behind victory has stolen a lot of his thunder _meta_end_dot_

 what that means is that michigan is going to be enormously important because it looks likely to turn into a three way battle between mccain s momentum huckabee s populism and mitt romney s home state advantage _meta_end_dot_

 the state will be most important to romney who poured enormous amounts of time treasure into iowa new hampshire and michigan _meta_end_dot_

 so far he s _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ in those states _meta_end_dot_

 if he goes _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ you have to think his money and momentum levels will take a real hit as people start writing his campaign off for dead _meta_end_dot_

 on the other hand a win in michigan for either huckabee or mccain would be huge _meta_end_dot_

 if huckabee pulls it off that should cement in a win for him in south carolina and give him a big boost in florida _meta_end_dot_

 on the other hand if mccain pulls it off that could allow him to climb into contention with huckabee for the lead in sc and could give him an opportunity to capture florida as well _meta_end_dot_

 long story short for the top _meta_number_ref_ candidates is that michigan is going to be a real opportunity to take charge of the race and since there has been no michigan polling since the middle of december it s impossible to know who s going to win the state right now _meta_end_dot_

 then there s rudy giuliani _meta_end_dot_

 his strategy which is to skip the early states win florida and then count on his high approval rating to carry him through super tuesday is looking less than sound _meta_end_dot_

 the latest florida poll does have him in first place but it s hard to see his holding on to that lead as huckabee and or mccain rack up wins _meta_end_dot_

 moreover rudy s popularity overall has dropped _meta_end_dot_

 rasmussen has him at _meta_percent_ref_ nationally and then since mccain won nh he isn t going to be dropping out before florida which is bad news for rudy because they draw off of many of the same voters _meta_end_dot_

 had mccain dropped out many of his supporters would have probably migrated over to rudy _meta_end_dot_

 what this means is that rudy s campaign isn t on life support yet but it s in the hospital bed looking worse by the day _meta_end_dot_

 fred sigh is looking to be in even deeper trouble _meta_end_dot_

 he stunk it up in nh and he is almost certainly going to do poorly in michigan as well _meta_end_dot_

 with that in mind fred has gone to sc but the latest insider advantage poll has him in single digits there _meta_end_dot_

 if fred doesn t win or at least finish _meta_number_ref_nd in sc he might as well call it quits because if he can t make it work in sc you have to ask where he can make it work _meta_end_dot_

 summary if mitt doesn t come out on top in michigan it s entirely possible that the race could quickly turn into a two man dance between mike huckabee and john mccain _meta_end_dot_

 if that is how things turn out given how huckabee has been relentlessly demonized in the conservative media over the last month you have to think that mccain has the edge _meta_end_dot_

 that being said the race is still very fluid and since the two candidates who seem to be bubbling up to the top aren t well liked by most conservatives it s still possible an alternative candidate could emerge _meta_end_dot_

 democrats on the democratic side hillary s win was a shocker _meta_end_dot_

 it was like one of those horror movies where the villain is shot five times and impaled on a giant spike then people look away turn back and she s behind you holding a machete _meta_end_dot_

 in this case everybody thought hillary was going to lose new hampshire and most people thought that would be the beginning of the end for her campaign _meta_end_dot_

 but now _meta_end_question_

 hillary is the comeback kid and this is a genuine dogfight again _meta_end_dot_

 michigan isn t going to be a competitive race because obama and edwards aren t on the ballot which means nevada and south carolina are the next big stops for the dems _meta_end_dot_

 there is no recent polling in nevada but obama has vaulted out to a big lead in sc _meta_end_dot_

 that makes nevada extremely important to hillary _meta_end_dot_

 if she wins that state she can still turn things around but if obama wins nevada and then wins sc you have to think that people will write off new hampshire as a fluke _meta_end_dot_

 so hillary has gotten her foot back in the door and she desperately needs to kick it open in nevada _meta_end_dot_

 will she be able to pull it off _meta_end_question_

 we ll have a better idea when the next batch of polling comes in _meta_end_dot_

 ps as to edwards he s already out of it so the only questions left are whether he ll drop out and if so when it will be _meta_end_dot_
