  although it would be a disaster for the country if barack obama got into the white house at least we d be able to recycle all the old liberal memes that were used against george bush _meta_end_dot_

 for example barack obama has not only never served in the military he probably can t even find the countries we re fighting in without someone explaining to him where they are yet he says he wants to stay in iraq for at least _meta_number_ref_ months wants to continue the war in afghanistan and has even spoken of invading pakistan _meta_end_dot_

 by the left s own standards i believe that makes him a chickenhawk does it not _meta_end_question_

 doesn t that make him unfit to be president compared to a veteran like john mccain _meta_end_question_

 now that s not my standard i think being a veteran speaks well of a man s character but doesn t automatically make him more qualified to be president than a non veteran _meta_end_dot_

 however that wasn t what the left was saying back in _meta_number_ref_ when john kerry was running against george w _meta_end_dot_

 bush who unlike barack obama at least served in the national guard _meta_end_dot_

 so with that in mind i thought it might be a good idea to appropriate a little bit of the left s artwork _meta_end_dot_

 what do you think of the improvements i made to it _meta_end_question_
