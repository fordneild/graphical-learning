  yesterday i got together with fred thompson s wife jeri thompson for a phone interview as she traveled around iowa _meta_end_dot_

 unfortunately near the end of the interview while she was running low on time she hit a bad cell _meta_end_dot_

 at that point i lost her permanently and wasn t able to reconnect with her to get in the final _meta_number_ref_ or _meta_number_ref_ questions _meta_end_dot_

 still i think you will enjoy the interview which has been edited slightly for the sake of grammar clarity and brevity _meta_end_dot_

 now if you become first lady would you have any role in fred s administration _meta_end_question_

 would you sit in on cabinet meetings for example _meta_end_question_

 laughs the only meeting i d be sitting in on would be the meeting when he gets off the clock well you really don t get off the clock when he gets together with the family _meta_end_dot_

 one thing he learned growing up is the importance of sitting down counting your blessings and having dinner together _meta_end_dot_

 that s the only one i would be involved in _meta_end_dot_

 now hillary clinton has been touting her experience as first lady on the campaign trail as if it s an enormous asset that makes her particularly well qualified to be president _meta_end_dot_

 she s even taking credit for some of the things her husband did as president _meta_end_dot_

 as a potential first lady what do you think of that _meta_end_question_

 well i try not to pass judgment on a lot of this stuff because everyone has had different experiences _meta_end_dot_

 what i know is that the experiences fred has had from getting married at _meta_number_ref_ and working in a factory putting himself through college and then through law school being a federal prosecutor at _meta_number_ref_ being minority council at _meta_number_ref_ moving on to help marie ragghianti take down a corrupt governor playing himself in the movies being a u s _meta_end_dot_

 senator and doing all the things he has done since then qualifies him to be president _meta_end_dot_

 marrying him doesn t qualify me to be in any of those decision making processes with him _meta_end_dot_

 all that qualifies me for is to be his wife and that s what i ought to do _meta_end_dot_

 i love him support him and try to be a good wife and a good mother _meta_end_dot_

 that s the role i signed onto when i married him _meta_end_dot_

 people forget that he was leaving the senate when i married him _meta_end_dot_

 we didn t really intend to do political things _meta_end_dot_

 one more question along these lines michelle obama perhaps about hillary clinton perhaps not said something and i wanted to get your reaction to it if you can t run your own house you certainly can t run the white house in other words if your marriage is a trainwreck you probably won t be a good president either _meta_end_dot_

 you think that s true _meta_end_question_

 well i think overall theoretically it s probably true _meta_end_dot_

 but they have a different relationship _meta_end_dot_

 they are direct rivals and they re going to say things about each other that i probably wouldn t choose to say _meta_end_dot_

 what i think is probably of more interest to some of your readers is the fact that conservative women get such a different treatment in the press including the women s press than the democrats _meta_end_dot_

 for goodness sake hillary has been on the cover of most women s magazines and had glowing reports on everything she has ever touched _meta_end_dot_

 michelle obama actually could stand up in an annie leibovitz spread in vogue magazine with her finger pointed at her husband s campaign manager telling him what to do in the caption and i don t think that cindy or judith or i could get away with such a thing _meta_end_dot_

 so you don t think republican women get fair treatment compared to the democratic women _meta_end_question_

 generally speaking no i don t _meta_end_dot_

 i agree with you _meta_end_dot_

 now let me ask you a question you ve probably heard _meta_number_ref_ times you have been called a trophy wife quite a bit during this campaign _meta_end_dot_

 do you find that insulting given what you ve accomplished in your life _meta_end_question_

 you know your perspective changes as things in your life change _meta_end_dot_

 at first it was kind of a strange experience to go through but now after being on the bus with the boys and being _meta_number_ref_ years old with two kids under _meta_number_ref_ i am thinking that s not such a bad thing to be said about me _meta_end_dot_

 laughs yeah it is kind of a backhanded compliment isn t it _meta_end_question_

 laughs as i said my perspective has changed and i m not so sure it s bad _meta_end_dot_

 all my girlfriends and my aunts have been telling me you know what _meta_end_question_

 you ll look back on that and you ll be happy now the other candidates obviously planned their runs at the presidency quite a long time ago _meta_end_dot_

 since high school probably _meta_end_dot_

 right _meta_end_dot_

 but fred entered the race after the grassroots pleaded for him to get in _meta_end_dot_

 so tell us about the first time you and fred had a serious discussion about his running for the presidency this year _meta_end_dot_

 when was it and can you tell us a little bit about it _meta_end_question_

 well i know one of the conversations we had we were sitting around our kitchen table and we do have these two small children so looking at a three and a half year old at the top of the stairs he said to me a lot goes through your mind from the time hayden is at the top of those steps to the time she s at the bottom _meta_end_dot_

 i feel our country is at a crossroads and we need to do something i agree _meta_end_dot_

 now early on in the campaign there were allegations that you were at the root of some staff shake ups with your husband s campaign _meta_end_dot_

 is that true _meta_end_question_

 no _meta_end_dot_

 early on back when he first started when he had a contract with nbc and a contract with abc and we had the two small kids we were doing the best we could to try to juggle the move from sort of a grassroots movement into a presidential campaign and anything i did was at the request of fred _meta_end_dot_

 anything i did was certainly something that he wanted to be done _meta_end_dot_

 my job isn t any different than that of any other wife in any other strong marriage _meta_end_dot_

 that s to be a partner and to be supportive and to try to do what i need to do to help him get to where he needs to be _meta_end_dot_

 so what is your role with the campaign _meta_end_question_

 what do you do on a day to day basis _meta_end_question_

 do you do anything that the campaign manager would normally do _meta_end_question_

 anything like that _meta_end_question_

 no _meta_end_dot_

 well i do media as people are interested like you in talking to me _meta_end_dot_

 i spoke to a radio station out of new hampshire this morning _meta_end_dot_

 i spoke to a radio station in central florida earlier today _meta_end_dot_

 i try to do what i can to make sure that he gets fed and goes to bed at a reasonable hour _meta_end_dot_

 other than that i am busy trying to find christmas presents for my children that aren t made in china and don t have lead based paint _meta_end_dot_

 laughs yes i guess that is a good thing to do _meta_end_dot_

 we went to a toy story i think we were in waterloo and we walked around this fantastically quaint toy store and i could not find i had about _meta_number_ref_ cameras with me by the way and none of us could find a toy that wasn t made in china or taiwan _meta_end_dot_

 it broke my heart _meta_end_dot_

 i bet _meta_end_dot_

 now the dynamic with your husband s campaign has been a little odd _meta_end_dot_

 what i keep hearing people say about him is that he s the most conservative candidate that he s the most consistent conservative candidate that he has the best policy proposals and that they liked how he performed at the debate but they think he s lazy _meta_end_dot_

 so you know him well and you ve gotten to see him in the campaign so is it true _meta_end_question_

 i mean at home do you have to like bring him his slippers and his remote control or anything _meta_end_dot_

 laughs you know what s interesting about this is that all of these things that people say about us don t square _meta_end_dot_

 if you really think about all these different stories they don t really make sense _meta_end_dot_

 if i am what they say on one level do you really see me running around after him with slippers _meta_end_dot_

 laughs _meta_end_dot_

 laughs when people talk about fred thompson the people that have known him for years and years i mean all the way back to when he was at vanderbilt law school he is the same guy now that he was then _meta_end_dot_

 what i mean by that is that he is very deliberate very thoughtful and though he may be slow talking as some folks are in the south certainly it doesn t mean he s lazy _meta_end_dot_

 i think what we re talking about here is a label that people are trying to put on him because you cannot tear apart this man s integrity _meta_end_dot_

 he doesn t dance to any man s tune _meta_end_dot_

 why do you think those facts she s referring to imao s hilarious fred facts which we discussed right before the interview began resonate _meta_end_question_

 because he is that strong john wayne kind of guy _meta_end_dot_

 i love him so i m not impartial on this subject but for goodness sake look at the guy s resume _meta_end_dot_

 who is the guy you want on your side of the table _meta_end_question_

 do you want someone who doesn t know who they are _meta_end_question_

 fred started after he read barry goldwater s conscience of a conservative the first young republicans club in lawrenceburg tn _meta_end_dot_

 you think these other guys can say that _meta_end_question_

 i mean look at the sanctuary city issue alone _meta_end_dot_

 you had one of the other guys who actually went to the supreme court to fight for a sanctuary city _meta_end_dot_

 you can literally pluck through each of the issues and he has been the consistent conservative on all of them to his core that s what makes him not have to be so manic _meta_end_dot_

 why do these other guys have to jump up and down to make their case all the time _meta_end_question_

 because they didn t have the same case some time ago _meta_end_dot_

 fred s politics do not depend on his geography or the office that he s running for _meta_end_dot_

 it s a beautiful thing to be with someone who is so comfortable with himself and knows where he thinks the country needs to go _meta_end_dot_

 it s really incredibly gratifying to see other people start to learn about who he is and what makes him tick and it s not what the mainstream media says _meta_end_dot_

 just because they don t get it doesn t mean it ain t there _meta_end_dot_

 now fred is more popular in the blogosphere than any of the other candidates there s no question about that but there seems to be sort of a strange hostility towards him from let s say fox news and some of the bigger names inside the beltway conservative pundits _meta_end_dot_

 first of all do you think that s true and if so why do you think that s the case _meta_end_question_

 well i do think that s true at some level early on because of the fact that he got in at a more traditional time than some of the other candidates that started running in high school it really didn t fit the schedules and planning of some of the media outlets _meta_end_dot_

 he really doesn t like to play the game the way they think it s supposed to be played _meta_end_dot_

 he likes to shoot it straight _meta_end_dot_

 he likes to tell them how it is _meta_end_dot_

 some folks don t like that so much _meta_end_dot_

 he also doesn t play by anyone else s rules _meta_end_dot_

 there s an unwritten rule that no one likes to talk about and that s that you have to play the game the way media wants to play it and you can be their darling _meta_end_dot_

 he s not that kind of guy jeri hit a bad cell and i lost her for about _meta_number_ref_ seconds _meta_end_dot_

 give me an example of not playing the game the way the media wants to play it _meta_end_dot_

 well folks got upset that he didn t get in early _meta_end_dot_

 they said you have to get in now you have to do it this way _meta_end_dot_

 you have to raise a hundred million dollars _meta_end_dot_

 he said you know what _meta_end_question_

 i don t think that s a good return on the american people s investment _meta_end_dot_

 i think i can get my message out a different way and can save them _meta_number_ref_ million dollars by getting in a little bit later and i m still going to be the leader in these debates _meta_end_dot_

 i am going to be the one that says no to an overbearing moderator and i am not going to put my hand up thank you very much _meta_end_dot_

 you re going to give me a minute on how americans are going to get together and save the world _meta_end_dot_

 jeri hit another bad cell and i lost her permanently here _meta_end_dot_
