  i ve continued watching the convention on cnn primarily because i want to get the liberal spin as it occurs or maybe because i am more of a masochist than i realize _meta_end_dot_

 either way cnn is very annoying _meta_end_dot_

 anyway things kicked off at _meta_number_ref_ pm with melissa etheridge performing _meta_end_dot_

 that cnn showed _meta_end_dot_

 but then while harry reid was speaking they interviewed brian schweitzer which is bizarre _meta_end_dot_

 they have the senate majority leader on stage and they re talking to someone who spoke last night how does that make sense _meta_end_question_

 then cnn ran into spike lee on the convention floor and they tried to bait him into saying something controversial about bill clinton _meta_end_dot_

 oh did bill clinton hurt himself with the black community _meta_end_question_

 surprisingly spike showed good judgment for once didn t take the bait and kept his comments nice and boring _meta_end_dot_

 oh good grief _meta_end_dot_

 madeline albright was on the stage and they ignored her _meta_end_dot_

 what the hell is wrong with cnn _meta_end_question_

 one interesting nugget from cnn they handed out flags instead of bill clinton signs for clinton s speech because they didn t feel like bill had earned signs with his name on them _meta_end_dot_

 pettiness thy name is barack _meta_end_dot_

 ok finally after a full hour we get to the big dog giving his speech at nine _meta_end_dot_

 bill got a rousing ovation from the crowd and he finally had to ask them to sit down and please stop because they were cheering him for too long _meta_end_dot_

 michelle obama actually looked happy to have bill up there which was a change from how she was with hillary _meta_end_dot_

 bill made a much more enthusiastic and genuine pitch for obama than hillary did and the crowd ate him up a the spoon _meta_end_dot_

 clinton even made the first real attempt to answer the he isn t ready to lead charge _meta_end_dot_

 essentially it was he s smart and joe biden will help which isn t great but is still better than anyone else has done _meta_end_dot_

 bill spent most of his time beating up on the republican party instead of mccain which was the way to go _meta_end_dot_

 in fact i suggested that very tactic _meta_end_dot_

 it was an a speech _meta_end_dot_

 they should have had bill doing a different speech every hour on the hour all through the convention _meta_end_dot_

 they would have gotten a _meta_number_ref_ point bounce _meta_end_dot_

 from there they went to john kerry _meta_end_dot_

 cnn didn t even cover all of kerry s speech which is just mind boggling _meta_end_dot_

 he was the democratic nominee for president in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 seriously do people watching the democratic national convention want to hear john kerry speak or david gergen spin _meta_end_question_

 i think for about _meta_percent_ref_ of the people watching the answer would be the former _meta_end_dot_

 when they did finally cut to kerry he was giving a rousing well for kerry speech attacking mccain and bush and trying to spin obama as the man the country could trust on foreign policy _meta_end_dot_

 there were a lot of smears innuendo and lies in there but ya know it is the democratic convention so what do you expect _meta_end_question_

 it was mostly a red meat speech featuring a lot of tired rhetoric well what we saw of it _meta_end_dot_

 c _meta_end_question_

 there was a steven spielberg film done as a tribute to vets which amazingly they didn t turn into a bush iraq war piece _meta_end_dot_

 from there they had a veteran speak whom cnn ignored for about _meta_number_ref_ minutes _meta_end_dot_

 she nominated biden and then nancy pelosi blech hit the floor _meta_end_dot_

 then we had the joe biden intro speech _meta_end_dot_

 joe is the salt of the earth blah blah blah _meta_end_dot_

 out comes his son beau biden to humanize him _meta_end_dot_

 he started with a story about biden losing a child _meta_number_ref_ years ago in an auto wreck and coming to their bedside _meta_end_dot_

 then he talked about how joe used to stutter when he was a kid _meta_end_dot_

 next up he talks about their spin on joe s greatest legislative hits he gets extra points because he is going to iraq later this year yet he didn t overtly mention it _meta_end_dot_

 then joe came out and they had a big hug _meta_end_dot_

 all in all it was a good intro and a better more moving speech than most of the pro speakers on day _meta_number_ref_ and _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 ps joe really has a beaming smile when he uncorks it _meta_end_dot_

 his kid is serving in iraq _meta_end_dot_

 biden s wife is a good looking woman emotes well _meta_end_dot_

 even biden s ancient mother looked completely adorable and sweet when they cut to her _meta_end_dot_

 they re a good looking political family _meta_end_dot_

 biden said some nice words about hillary and bill sold himself a bit took a few shots at mccain and started building up obama _meta_end_dot_

 he did fudge a lot on what obama did in his limited time in the senate _meta_end_dot_

 a lot of stuff obama just tagged along on turned into things he supposedly led the way on _meta_end_dot_

 then he went on a that s not change that s more of the same attack on mccain _meta_end_dot_

 he said we need more than a good soldier we need a wise leader _meta_end_dot_

 is that supposed to be obama _meta_end_question_

 biden did try to make a case for obama and took a lot of shots at mccain on foreign policy _meta_end_dot_

 all in all despite the fact that it hasn t gotten great reviews i thought biden gave a b speech _meta_end_dot_

 from there the obamamessiah made a quick appearance said a few nice things about the clintons and got the throngs cheering _meta_end_dot_

 summary after two lackluster nights the democrats finally got going tonight _meta_end_dot_

 all and all it was probably a b night for them _meta_end_dot_

 this was definitely a good night for them although they still lack a positive theme for obama beyond change and their mccain s bush theme is a little soft given that the press has spent the last year telling anyone who will listen that he s a maverick who s not like other republicans _meta_end_dot_
