  a little while back i had the privilege of interviewing ross douthat about the book he co authored with reihan salam grand new party how republicans can win the working class and save the american dream _meta_end_dot_

 now i don t agree with everything that ross douthat advocates in the book but i do think it s important to talk about how the conservative movement and the gop are going to get back in the groove again and that s what ross book does _meta_end_dot_

 here s a short publisher s weekly review of ross s book from amazon to give you a better idea of what the book is all about coauthored by atlantic monthly writers douthat and salam this book like david frum s comeback is part of a movement to reconstruct the republican party s core principles and reinvigorate the conservative electorate _meta_end_dot_

 the authors strategy is to win back the working class through a combination of prudent government intervention and entrepreneurship _meta_end_dot_

 relying on a bevy of sociological analysis class scrutiny and historicism a style resembling new york times columnist david brooks s but stripped of his literary flair douthat and salam take a nuts and bolts approach perhaps because their book is prescriptive rather than observational policy advocacy not entertainment _meta_end_dot_

 whether or not readers will agree with the tenor of their arguments rarely have moderate conservative ideas been so intelligently streamlined and so self consciously pruned of conservatism s hairier iterations _meta_end_dot_

 the real holes in the text are the lack of cogent discussions on immigration and the war against radical islam the very issues currently shaping working class politics in america _meta_end_dot_

 nevertheless this book is stuffed with fresh and brilliant ideas and presents a solid domestic conservative agenda to win over blue collar workers _meta_end_dot_

 july now as you might guess by the fact that you haven t seen an interview yet there was an issue _meta_end_dot_

 you see after having a recorder problem once while interviewing steven milloy i have always used two tape recorders to make sure that i don t lose another interview _meta_end_dot_

 however there was one possibility i did not consider _meta_end_dot_

 you see i stuck batteries in both tape recorders at the same time and it never occurred to me that they might both run down simultaneously _meta_end_dot_

 unfortunately that s exactly what happened when i interviewed ross _meta_end_dot_

 at a certain point one of the recorders kept rolling but stopped recording _meta_end_dot_

 the other did record but the quality was so poor that it was largely indecipherable _meta_end_dot_

 because of that i couldn t post the interview for you but i did at least want to do a nice plug for grand new party how republicans can win the working class and save the american dream _meta_end_dot_

 so if you re looking for some new thinking on how the gop can change things around this book may be exactly what you want to read _meta_end_dot_
