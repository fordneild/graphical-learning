  ann coulter was not officially speaking at cpac but the yaf brought her in as a speaker _meta_end_dot_

 you had to get tickets in advance to get in and it was a hot ticket to have _meta_end_dot_

 she was speaking in a medium sized room and i kid you not the line to get in stretched across three floors _meta_end_dot_

 there s no way at least _meta_percent_ref_ of those people got in but thankfully i got in on a media pass _meta_end_dot_

 i grabbed some yaf guy and asked to get ahead of the line and he asked who i was with _meta_end_dot_

 i said right wing news and no flicker of recognition crossed his face as he walked off to check about getting me to the head of the line then i had a thought i m with townhall turns out they were sponsoring the event so i was in there early and close to the front _meta_end_dot_

 thank god for media passes _meta_end_dot_

 ann gave about a _meta_number_ref_ minute speech and then answered questions for another _meta_number_ref_ minutes _meta_end_dot_

 she did a little hillary bashing but she spent the majority of the speech beating john mccain s brains in _meta_end_dot_

 however she did at least say that she would vote for mccain if mitt romney was his veep _meta_end_dot_

 otherwise she says she s voting for hillary _meta_end_dot_

 believe it or not ann seemed to be trying to make a serious case that hillary would be better on foreign policy than mccain which is although i love ann absolutely nuts _meta_end_dot_

 did she say anything super controversial _meta_end_question_

 nothing too over the top by ann s standards although she did compare mccain to hitler at one point except she said hitler had better tax policy _meta_end_dot_

 the audience ate her up with a spoon although in a q a segment you got a sense that at least part of the audience realized that she really wasn t joking about not supporting mccain in _meta_number_ref_ and it made them a little nervous _meta_end_dot_

 ps i have the whole thing on tape _meta_end_dot_

 there will be a video mash up on monday _meta_end_dot_
