  c nbc s maria bartiromo lays out the obama plan for your money if he s elected president he s going to take the capital gains tax at _meta_number_ref_ percent right now all the way up to _meta_number_ref_ to _meta_number_ref_ percent _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 sell anything like a home or stocks and make a profit _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 almost _meta_number_ref_ percent of the profit will go to the government instead of _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 right now the top income tax rate is _meta_number_ref_ percent obama wants to take that to _meta_number_ref_ percent _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 we re talking about people who make over _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 that s not rich _meta_end_dot_

 so it s actually going to impact more people than you may think and then there s his promise of a windfall profits tax as dicussed by bartiromo and other here _meta_end_dot_

 says one of the analysts ron insana with whom she speaks we ve seen this happen before during the last oil price shock in the _meta_number_ref_s and it s not a terribly efficient way to address some of the problems that we re seeing in the energy sector _meta_end_dot_

 this is a multifaceted extremely complex problem that isn t going to be solved by taxing oil companies with respect to raising taxes at any time whether you re taxing the rich or raising capital gain dividend taxes i think it s counterintuitive that any one of those steps would be helpful to the u s _meta_end_dot_

 economy and quite detrimental given the load that everyone is carrying at the moment the more i hear about obama s plans the more i realize that john mccain may be right it appears he s running for jimmy carter s second term _meta_end_dot_

 and we all know what americans did about that _meta_end_dot_

 nothing like raising taxes during a slowing economy to remind us of the joy of the blessedly short carter era _meta_end_dot_
