  k ameradsm of the daily kos is just depressed when he or she considers our prowess in the olympics and a bunch of statistics he or she ran across when looking for negative info on the us as we continue to celebrate the olympics with profound pride and patriotism i wanted to share some disheartening rankings that reflect our country s stark decline relative to the rest of the world _meta_end_dot_

 i list these fully knowing this community s cognizance of such issues but sometimes numbers yield a haunting and thus effective reminder _meta_end_dot_

 for anyone truly proud to be american these numbers should anger motivate and prompt action _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_nd world rank of u s _meta_end_dot_

 infant mortality rate _meta_end_dot_

 first ceo to worker pay ratio _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ second place is brazil at _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_th adult literacy scale organization for economic cooperation and development _meta_number_ref_th student reading ability source oecd _meta_number_ref_th u s _meta_end_dot_

 rank on the healthcare quality index world health organization _meta_number_ref_th rank of u s _meta_end_dot_

 on women s rights world economic forum report _meta_number_ref_th life expectancy _meta_number_ref_th u s _meta_end_dot_

 rank on journalistic press freedom index reporters without borders _meta_number_ref_th u s _meta_end_dot_

 rank on quality of life survey economist magazine _meta_number_ref_th environmental stability index yale center for environmental law and policy _meta_number_ref_st aid to poor nations of the world as percentage of gross national income _meta_beep_ref_ these stats are re presented from vincent bugliosi s excellent new book the prosecution of george w _meta_end_dot_

 bush for murder we are the wealthiest nation in the world and widely indoctrinated to consider ourselves the greatest nation _meta_end_dot_

 of course if we were to measure our greatness by military might and financial wealth we d be no _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ no doubt _meta_end_dot_

 but what makes a nation truly great is its leadership and devotion to social moral issues _meta_end_dot_

 take seriously the numbers above and you ll have a hard time finding the tenacity to say we re the greatest to be honest one should be wary of any person government or institution that self proclaims greatness have to love the name of the book which is the source of the info don t you _meta_end_question_

 as with any statistical analysis you have to look at details _meta_end_dot_

 let s take foreign aid for instance _meta_end_dot_

 i found a _meta_number_ref_ story pdf on that from the la times which addresses precisely the claim made by our friend at the daily kos but using a per capita standard _meta_end_dot_

 and the result _meta_end_question_

 the united states has significantly increased its foreign aid to poor countries but still ranks _meta_number_ref_th among the _meta_number_ref_ richest nations in its overall performance in helping the world s poor according to a widely watched annual report _meta_end_dot_

 according to that report per capita the us gives _meta_number_ref_ through the government and about _meta_number_ref_ privately per day _meta_end_dot_

 the united states spent _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ billion in foreign aid in _meta_number_ref_ more than any other nation _meta_end_dot_

 the number one nation denmark gives _meta_number_ref_ per person day _meta_end_dot_

 sounds like a huge difference until you do the math _meta_end_dot_

 denmark has a population of a medium sized metro area in the us _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ which means given the report s number it doles out exactly _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ per year in foreign aid _meta_end_dot_

 so tell me does _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ billion buy more food build more schools and help more nations than does _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ billion _meta_end_question_

 unless my schooling was as bad as some people claim it was i d say it is significantly more than denmark s contribution _meta_end_dot_

 but that s the problem when you try to make comparisons like this _meta_end_dot_

 the total amount of money is what makes a difference not the per capita level _meta_end_dot_

 while it s nice that denmark has that per capita level of aid their total contribution obviously doesn t do what ours can do _meta_end_dot_

 i ve covered infant mortality before and while the problem is a little different it again is a false comparison when you get into the details _meta_end_dot_

 and that s what you have to watch in america sucks laments like kameradsm s _meta_end_dot_

 the old saw of lies damn lies and statistics was never more true than here _meta_end_dot_

 like so many at daily kos i ve been inspired by the world s athletes at the summer games _meta_end_dot_

 a simple thought came to me while watching the u s _meta_end_dot_

 runners and gymnasts last night if the u s _meta_end_dot_

 can be no _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ in overall medal count for the beijing games there s no reason we can t be the greatest at overcoming our culture s immense moral shortcomings _meta_end_dot_

 if we can be patriotic about the _meta_number_ref_m butterfly we can again be patriotic about things other than war and money like perhaps helping the huddled masses yearning to breathe free immense moral shortcomings my goodness _meta_end_dot_

 how does this person manage to continue to live here _meta_end_question_

 of course he or she makes no examination at all of the details of the stats he or she throws around _meta_end_dot_

 it s enough that they look bad for the us and allows him or her to engage in a round of self righteous moral indignation related to our assumed greed selfishness and moral decline _meta_end_dot_

 it obviously fills a need _meta_end_dot_

 so i ll leave him or her to cry in his or her beer or wine while i continue to enjoy the olympics _meta_end_dot_

 i see the games as a perfect representative of the greatness of our country _meta_end_dot_

 while we may not be perfect no set of manipulated stats can hide the fact that we are and we remain the greatest nation on earth and our immigration stats you know those huddled masses prove it _meta_end_dot_

 despite repeated statistical attempts to prove we re not worthy immigrants continue to flood the country and declare it the most amazing place on earth _meta_end_dot_

 and if you don t quite understand that point look at the us men s gymnastic team as the perfect example _meta_number_ref_nd generation chinese _meta_number_ref_nd generation indian _meta_number_ref_nd generation russian among the rest of the team _meta_end_dot_

 their parents saw the potential living in the us presented and their children realized it _meta_end_dot_

 yup the olympics make the point very well _meta_end_dot_

 too bad our friend can t sit back and just enjoy the fact that he or she lives in the greatest nation on earth _meta_end_dot_
