  i have become a symbol of the possibility of america returning to our best traditions barack obama liberals are almost always insufferably arrogant _meta_end_dot_

 it sort of goes with the territory _meta_end_dot_

 after all if you believe that we have to throw religious customs hundreds of years worth of societal traditions and the parts of the constitution you disagree with into the wastebasket based primarily on your feeling that they re antiquated or no longer necessary then you almost certainly must have an ego the size of a small planet _meta_end_dot_

 that brings us to barack obama who even amongst liberals is notorious for being full of himself _meta_end_dot_

 conservatives who have pointed this out have been recently accused rather uncreatively i might add of calling obama uppity the whole idea and concept of a black man being uppity or acting above his station by doing things white people do didn t that go out in like the fifties _meta_end_question_

 i was born in the seventies grew up in the heart of the deep south in small town north carolina and i don t ever recall someone referring to a black man as uppity not to say that there weren t racists in that town there were or that no one ever thinks like that anymore there probably are still a few robert byrds out there but if the democrats have to reach that far into obscurity to try to keep people from talking about obama s arrogance then they must really believe that obama s tendency to turn his nose up at the hoi polloi is a weak point _meta_end_dot_

 incidentally they re right it is _meta_end_dot_

 the american people don t like snobbish political hacks with delusions of grandeur like obama and the more they get to know him the less they will like him personally _meta_end_dot_

 we are the ones we ve been waiting for on the other hand obama would make a great rock star wouldn t he _meta_end_question_

 he d probably be one of those rappers who repeats his own name _meta_number_ref_ times in a three minute long song _meta_end_dot_

 it s that kind of arrogance that makes lines like this one just seem to naturally roll off his tongue you got into these small towns in pennsylvania and like a lot of small towns in the midwest the jobs have been gone now for _meta_number_ref_ years and nothing s replaced them _meta_end_dot_

 and they fell through the clinton administration and the bush administration and each successive administration has said that somehow these communities are gonna regenerate and they have not _meta_end_dot_

 and it s not surprising then they get bitter they cling to guns or religion or antipathy to people who aren t like them or anti immigrant sentiment or anti trade sentiment as a way to explain their frustrations that quote is a window into barack obama s world _meta_end_dot_

 there are the enlightened few like barack obama and then there are the little people who are bitter and cling to guns religion or anti immigrant sentiment because their primitive brains have left them frustrated and unable to see the big picture _meta_end_dot_

 the bitter people need a man like barack obama in the white house a harvard grad who enjoys arugula and basking in the limelight in europe to make the decisions for them that tragically they re just not learned enough to make on their own _meta_end_dot_

 the deep irony here is that many of the frustrated bitter people that obama peers down on from on high are just as qualified to be president of the united states as he is _meta_end_dot_

 obama has never served in the military in the house or as a governor _meta_end_dot_

 he has never run a business was just elected to the senate in _meta_number_ref_ and has had exactly one hard fought political victory in his entire career against hillary clinton _meta_end_dot_

 so who would be more qualified to be president obama or let s say a guy who served a couple of tours in the military got out started his own successful small business and has served a couple of terms on his local city council _meta_end_question_

 i have few doubts that the city councilman would be far more in touch with the real world and more competent to lead the country than someone who was so haughty and dare i say messianic that he proclaimed i am absolutely certain that generations from now we will be able to look back and tell our children that this was the moment when we began to provide care for the sick and good jobs to the jobless this was the moment when the rise of the oceans began to slow and our planet began to heal _meta_end_dot_

 and that is ultimately the problem with having a president who combines limited experience with towering arrogance _meta_end_dot_

 putting barack obama in charge of the united states would be like making a cocky high school class president the new ceo of wal mart _meta_end_dot_

 not only would he not know what to do he wouldn t know what not to do or even that he doesn t know the difference _meta_end_dot_
