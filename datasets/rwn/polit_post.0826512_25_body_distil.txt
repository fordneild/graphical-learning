 in an earlier post i mentioned it but only in the context of the upcoming vp debates _meta_end_dot_

 i completely missed something _meta_end_dot_

 if paying more taxes is patriotic it stands to reason that paying less taxes is unpatriotic _meta_end_dot_

 therefore our troops in war zones who are exempt from income taxes are unpatriotic _meta_end_dot_

 that also means that poor people who do not pay income tax are unpatriotic _meta_end_dot_

 obama s efforts to exclude people from the tax roles are also unpatriotic _meta_end_dot_

 joe s deductions on his tax returns for charitable giving are unpatriotic _meta_end_dot_

 any mortgage deductions are unpatriotic _meta_end_dot_

 child tax credits _meta_end_question_

 unpatriotic _meta_end_dot_

 i could go on all day _meta_end_dot_

 i would really really like joe to continue on this line _meta_end_dot_

 thing i know _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 some ideas look serious only because they re never taken that way _meta_end_dot_

 the most devastating thing you can do to a dumb idea is to take it seriously _meta_end_dot_

 i ve noticed there is a particularly odious practice of fact checking about the tax plans of the prospective obama biden administration obama biden is an anagram of an idea bomb and the mccain campaign s comments on those tax plans _meta_end_dot_

 factcheck org to their discredit has a wonderful example of this on their web site right now the ad continues mccain s pattern of misrepresenting sen _meta_end_dot_

 barack obama s tax proposals as falling on middle income families _meta_end_dot_

 it claims that obama promises more taxes on small businesses seniors your life savings your family but that s untrue for the vast majority of small businesses seniors and individual taxpayers who would see their taxes go down under obama s actual plan _meta_end_dot_

 he proposes to increase taxes only for those with more than _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ in family income or _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ in individual income _meta_end_dot_

 emphasis mine karol we have another such transgression committed by the ap under the economic plan proposed by democratic presidential candidate barack obama people earning more than _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ a year would pay more in taxes while those earning less the vast majority of american taxpayers would receive a tax cut _meta_end_dot_

 although republican john mccain claims that obama would raise taxes the independent tax policy center and other groups conclude that four out of five u s _meta_end_dot_

 households would receive tax cuts under obama s proposals _meta_end_dot_

 the pattern is that if it can be categorized as a tax cut for _meta_percent_ref_ of us then everyone should be thinking of it as a tax cut for all of us even if the remaining five percent see their tax liabilities go shootin so freakin high that it ends up being a net increase _meta_end_dot_

 it all depends on your point of view in my world if we all end up paying more then we all end up paying more _meta_end_dot_

 but i notice if you look at this through the left wing lens whether you know you re doing it or not like factcheck org and the ap up there then _meta_percent_ref_ of us pay less taxes _meta_end_dot_

 and then if you look at that through the biden lens we re just hemorrhaging our patriotism _meta_end_dot_

 oh dear _meta_end_exclamation_

 what s the an idea bomb administration gonna do about that _meta_end_question_
