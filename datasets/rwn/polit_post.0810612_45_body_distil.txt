  republican congressman geoff davis stepped in it saturday night when he said the following in reference to barack obama he said in his remarks at the gop dinner that he also recently participated in a highly classified national security simulation with obama _meta_end_dot_

 i m going to tell you something that boy s finger does not need to be on the button davis said _meta_end_dot_

 he could not make a decision in that simulation that related to a nuclear threat to this country dumb dumb dumb dumb _meta_end_dot_

 of course since obama isn t even qualified to be president i m not surprised that bo bombed in a national security simulation _meta_end_dot_

 moreover obama certainly isn t competent enough to have his finger on the button _meta_end_dot_

 however the moment david used the word boy everything else he said became secondary to the left s complaining and kvetching that he offended them _meta_end_dot_

 happily davis at least offered an almost immediate and sincere sounding apology for any offense he may have caused _meta_end_dot_

 still anyone savvy enough to get elected to congress should know that you don t call a black man boy that s why it was very foolish for davis to give the left a club like that to beat him with in the first place _meta_end_dot_
