  this week end i caught david zucker s an american carol _meta_end_dot_

 the general idea behind it is a michael moore stand in wants to ban the _meta_number_ref_th of july and _meta_number_ref_ ghosts general patton yes that general patton george washington and the angel of death try to straighten him out _meta_end_dot_

 the general idea behind the movie is supposed to be a christmas carol meets airplane and the movie is at its best when it sticks to that formula _meta_end_dot_

 however at times the movie moves away from comedy and focuses on a heavy handed conservative message _meta_end_dot_

 although personally i didn t mind that it was sort of a strange mixture airplane style humor a serious message about the war on terror and a straightforward conservative take _meta_end_dot_

 did i like the movie _meta_end_question_

 yes _meta_end_dot_

 would you like the movie _meta_end_question_

 if you re reading this page yes you probably would _meta_end_dot_

 however that s part of the reason why the movie is bombing at the box office in week one _meta_end_dot_

 it s a movie that seems to be targeted at a very narrow slice of the populace hard core politically aware conservatives who like spoof style comedy mixed with a serious message _meta_end_dot_

 long story short i thought the movie was very funny at the beginning and at the end it was more serious in the middle i d give a thumbs up and if you re reading rwn you re probably exactly the sort of person who d love the movie _meta_end_dot_

 that being said i think the movie would have been better and would have had an opportunity to reach a much larger audience if they d stuck with a formula more similar to team america world police which kept it funny all the way through and didn t use a hammer and tongs to get its message across _meta_end_dot_
