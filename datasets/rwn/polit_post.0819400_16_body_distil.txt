  w ell yeah to a degree i agree _meta_end_dot_

 that was what sen _meta_end_dot_

 phil gramm said yesterday about americans _meta_end_dot_

 he also said for many it is a mental recession meaning that to this point they ve not suffered the results of an actual recession but have adopted the attitude prevalent during a recession and i suppose help it become a reality _meta_end_dot_

 i ve never been much of a gramm fan but his criticism hit home _meta_end_dot_

 just listen to the whining about gas prices for heaven sake _meta_end_dot_

 and you d think the iraq war was the most costly and brutal war ever fought if you listened to a certain segment of our population _meta_end_dot_

 not to mention the sky is falling jobs are scarce _meta_number_ref_ _meta_percent_ref_ unemployment considered full employment but part of that mental recession the right jobs aren t available the housing crisis and well you name it and someone is whining about it _meta_end_dot_

 certainly gramm s comments may have been deemed by many as politically incorrect and insensitive but i see them as essentially on target _meta_end_dot_

 however the political season is the whining season _meta_end_dot_

 whining is encouraged _meta_end_dot_

 politicians are on stage to tell us how bad things are and how well they are going to fix them _meta_end_dot_

 this is when candidates have town hall meetings and potential voters whine about their condition and ask the candidate what they re going to do for them _meta_end_dot_

 america is hurting today he said _meta_end_dot_

 michigan is hurting today _meta_end_dot_

 the automotive industry is hurting _meta_end_dot_

 and we ve got big problems and we ve got big challenges and the candidates pander _meta_end_dot_

 and pander _meta_end_dot_

 and pander _meta_end_dot_

 so it is absolutely unacceptable for an adviser to any politician to say something which doesn t help the panderfest _meta_end_dot_

 that is why phil gramm ended up being immediately thrown under the straight talk express before he had time to get his helmet and pads on _meta_end_dot_
