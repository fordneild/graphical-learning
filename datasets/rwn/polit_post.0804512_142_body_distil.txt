  this isn t exactly the sort of news that reassures conservatives that the gop s nominee isn t so bad after all abc news teddy davis reports on wednesday a top adviser to john mccain said more definitively than he has in the past that he will step down from the arizona senator s presidential campaign if the presumed gop nominee faces sen _meta_end_dot_

 barack obama d ill in the general election _meta_end_dot_

 i would simply be uncomfortable being in a campaign that would be inevitably attacking barack obama said mccain adviser mark mckinnon in an interview with npr s all things considered i think it would be uncomfortable for me and i think it would be bad for the mccain campaign mckinnon who was a democrat before serving as president bush s ad maker in _meta_number_ref_ and _meta_number_ref_ said that he plans to be behind mccain _meta_number_ref_ percent no matter who the democratic nominee is _meta_end_dot_

 he explained however that if the democrats nominate obama he will be supporting mccain from the sidelines while saying that he does not agree with obama on every issue mckinnon gushed about the illinois democrat _meta_end_dot_

 the fact that john mccain has guys on his staff like mark mckinnon who s gushing over the most liberal man in the senate and juan hernandez whose loyalty is to mexico first and america _meta_number_ref_nd is disturbing _meta_end_dot_

 granted mccain is well mccain essentially a scoop jackson democrat with a r beside of his name _meta_end_dot_

 however he is going to need the support of conservatives to win in _meta_number_ref_ and jettisoning staffers like mckinnon and hernandez from his campaign should be a no brainer at this point _meta_end_dot_

 why have people on your staff whose very presence makes conservatives deeply and rightly suspicious of you _meta_end_question_

 moreover even if mccain could somehow win the election without getting solid support from the right which is unlikely he s going to have to start meeting conservatives halfway on a few issues to build up some good will or he s not going to be able to accomplish anything even if he s elected _meta_end_dot_

 if he becomes the president of the united states the democrats are going to oppose mccain on most things reflexively and if say half his own party is fighting him on everything too he s going to be hamstrung from the very beginning of his presidency which honestly given mccain s record might not be the worst thing in the world for the republican party _meta_end_dot_
