  one mistake that some people make is lumping all muslims together _meta_end_dot_

 the reality is that they re not all the same _meta_end_dot_

 sure some of them are radical but some of them are moderate _meta_end_dot_

 sure some of them are our enemies but some of them are our friends _meta_end_dot_

 strategically if you just say the koran says what it says and therefore a muslim is a muslim is a muslim you lose the opportunity to gain allies like this _meta_end_dot_

 the leader of the tribal confederation that has fought to expel al qaeda from most of iraq s anbar province is offering his men to help gin up a rebellion against osama bin laden s organization along the afghanistan pakistan border _meta_end_dot_

 in an interview sheik ahmad al rishawi told the new york sun that in april he prepared a _meta_number_ref_ page study on afghanistan and its tribes for the deputy chief of mission at the american embassy in kabul christopher dell _meta_end_dot_

 when asked if he would send military advisers to afghanistan to assist american troops fighting there he said i have no problem with this if they ask me i will do it the success of the anbari tribal rebellion known as the awakening spurred multinational forces iraq to try to emulate the model throughout iraq including with the predominately shiite tribes in the south of the country _meta_end_dot_

 today the tribe based militias formed to protect anbaris from al qaeda are forming a political alliance poised to unseat the confessional sunni parties currently in parliament in the provincial elections scheduled for the fall and the federal ones scheduled for _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 al qaeda is an ideology sheik ahmad said _meta_end_dot_

 we can defeat them inside iraq and we can defeat them in any country the tribal leader arrived in washington last week _meta_end_dot_

 all of his meetings including an audience with president bush have been closed to the public in part because the anbari sheiks while likely to win future electoral contests are not themselves part of iraq s elected government _meta_end_dot_

 of his meeting with mr _meta_end_dot_

 bush sheik ahmad said he was impressed _meta_end_dot_

 he is a brave man _meta_end_dot_

 he is also a wise man _meta_end_dot_

 he is taking care of the country s future the united states future _meta_end_dot_

 he is also taking care of the iraqi people the ordinary people in iraq _meta_end_dot_

 he wants to accomplish success in iraq when sheik ahmad s brother sheik sattar met with mr _meta_end_dot_

 bush in anbar last fall he told the president that he dedicated his victory over al qaeda to the victims of the attacks of september _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 on september _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ sheik sattar was assassinated by an improvised explosive device _meta_end_dot_

 since then his brother sheik ahmad has led the awakening movement _meta_end_dot_

 we have to rebuild a national iraqi army not built on sects but the same way they built up the anbar police he said _meta_end_dot_

 they must be well armed so they will be able to protect the country and all the american interests in the area _meta_end_dot_

 we also have to make a friendship treaty based on mutual respect between the two parties and then the united states will be able to withdraw from iraq if they wish and we will succeed in iraq the same way america succeeded in japan and germany the anbari sheik offered no comment on the details of the current negotiations on the american troop presence in iraq between prime minister al maliki and ambassador ryan crocker saying he was not involved in the negotiations _meta_end_dot_

 but he also said he favored such a status of forces agreement _meta_end_dot_

 with a diplomatic understanding we will be able to solve all the problems _meta_end_dot_

 we fully trust the americans _meta_end_dot_

 we know the united states never in its history occupied a country _meta_end_dot_

 on the contrary they were occupied and they were able to fight the occupier he said referring to the american rebellion against the british in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 sheik ahmad al rishawi _meta_end_question_

 would we agree on every single issue of philosophy and religion _meta_end_question_

 no but i m happy to have this guy on our side _meta_end_dot_

 every american should be and when we have an opportunity to ally with other ahmad al rishawi s we should take advantage of it _meta_end_dot_
