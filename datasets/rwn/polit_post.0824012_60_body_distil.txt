  so yesterday both cassy fiano and rachel lucas draw attention to an oprah article where a woman verbally brutalizes her husband in print media for all to see _meta_end_dot_

 she points out his foibles in the head scratching attempt to portray him as all men just naturally are moderately bad _meta_end_dot_

 men are bad _meta_end_dot_

 her husband is bad _meta_end_dot_

 she drones on for paragraphs finally concluding that the institution of marriage is to blame _meta_end_dot_

 well marriage is to blame and bad men _meta_end_dot_

 how her husband stays married to her after that disrespect i don t know _meta_end_dot_

 he gets what he deserves i guess _meta_end_dot_

 but that s not what i find fascinating about this article _meta_end_dot_

 what i find interesting is the perpetual non stop externalizing of blame indicative of a victim _meta_end_dot_

 the author comes across as a whining harpy shrill and full of impotent rage _meta_end_dot_

 and she s a liberated feminist _meta_end_exclamation_

 just to remind the feminists a liberated woman marries who she wants _meta_end_dot_

 she works where she desires _meta_end_dot_

 she controls her reproductive ability _meta_end_dot_

 she f cks who she pleases _meta_end_dot_

 she stays where she wants _meta_end_dot_

 she leaves when she s finished _meta_end_dot_

 a liberated woman s destiny isn t determined by her biology yes it is to an extent but i m spouting the feminist credo here _meta_end_dot_

 a woman s destiny isn t determined by a decision to marry or divorce or co habitate or prostitute or any other version of coupling and decoupling _meta_end_dot_

 why is this woman complaining bitching and sounding remarkably retro when she could be doing something about her lot in life _meta_end_question_

 for example i recently stood by as a clothing designer a mother in her _meta_number_ref_s announced to a group of women that she was divorcing her husband hmmmm _meta_end_dot_

 were the group of women a knitting circle _meta_end_question_

 were they at the club playing tennis _meta_end_question_

 were they her bunko group _meta_end_question_

 i m just wondering what kind of women s group were talking here _meta_end_dot_

 this woman reinforces every female stereotype _meta_end_dot_

 she complains about her husband _meta_end_dot_

 wow that never happens _meta_end_dot_

 well in the circles i run in i don t hear men bashing but most of the women i know are too busy and their husbands are too to sit around griping what s new about her bashing is that it isn t enough to gripe to her girlfriends she has to broadcast to everyone what a superficial mean mouthed woman she is _meta_end_dot_

 she has too much time on her hands obviously _meta_end_dot_

 she can name the problem but she can t find the solution _meta_end_dot_

 wow i wonder where all those nasty women jokes come from _meta_end_question_

 could it be the guys married to women like this _meta_end_question_

 if this woman believed she were liberated she d get proactive about her life and make herself happy instead of buying the fairytale fantasies that some man would rescue her from her sad sack life _meta_end_dot_

 she d get a job _meta_end_dot_

 she d make the relationship better if she could or she d move on _meta_end_dot_

 she wouldn t disrespect her husband or ex husband because he is the father of her children and she dishonors her own judgment by dishonoring him to her children thus undermining herself to them too _meta_end_dot_

 she d go lesbian and give up on men altogether and find bliss in a woman s arms since they re so much better than men _meta_end_dot_

 she d do something _meta_end_dot_

 but this woman isn t liberated _meta_end_dot_

 she s enslaved by her own ideology _meta_end_dot_

 like most liberals her decisions are someone else s responsibility _meta_end_dot_

 she gets pregnant because she was drunk and didn t use contraception get an abortion _meta_end_dot_

 she gets married and finds out that her spouse is human and fallible like all people and the institution of marriage must suck not her judgment and all men are bad and conversely all women are good _meta_end_dot_

 it s easier than looking internally and solving her own issues _meta_end_dot_

 so these big bad independent feminists _meta_number_ref_ years after women s suffrage sound like simpering helpless little women _meta_end_dot_

 they need to stop talking so damn much and start owning their choices _meta_end_dot_

 they want to be taken seriously but pieces like this just undermine their message _meta_end_dot_

 they aren t interested in liberation _meta_end_dot_

 they re interested in having someone to blame _meta_end_dot_
