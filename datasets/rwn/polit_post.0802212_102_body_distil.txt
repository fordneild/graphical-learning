  if you missed the democratic debate last night you have nothing to worry about because i ve hit all the key points in just over _meta_number_ref_ minutes of video _meta_end_dot_

 put another way i cut out all the clips that featured the candidates pitching socialist ideas pledging to surrender in iraq or repeating the same tired campaign slogans that they have for months and this was what was left _meta_end_dot_
