  after his victory in new hampshire john mccain was poised to blow the race wide open _meta_end_dot_

 he was ahead in sc and virtually tied for the top slot in nevada and florida _meta_end_dot_

 had he captured michigan the momentum he would have gained would have probably given him enough momentum to win all _meta_number_ref_ states and sweep through super tuesday _meta_end_dot_

 however mitt romney who was on the brink of being declared doa after losing iowa and new hampshire and having his national numbers tumble came through with a must have win in michigan _meta_end_dot_

 with that in mind here s a little breakdown of how things are looking for the top _meta_number_ref_ contenders after the michigan primary _meta_end_dot_

 fred thompson after iowa fred bypassed the other states where he did very poorly and went to south carolina _meta_end_dot_

 it s a southern state where they love conservatives _meta_end_dot_

 fred has been in the state almost non stop since iowa _meta_end_dot_

 he s had the money to run ads and there have been reports of surging support for him there _meta_end_dot_

 however the latest polls of south carolina which are both pre michigan have him in _meta_number_ref_th place _meta_end_dot_

 that is very bad news because if fred is going to remain viable he has to do well in south carolina _meta_end_dot_

 if he has a poor finish there his supporters will start to write him off and his national numbers which are sitting at around _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_percent_ref_ will plunge into single digits which would guarantee a poor showing on super tuesday if he decided to stay in that long _meta_end_dot_

 in other words it s do or die time for fred and if he can t finish at least in _meta_number_ref_nd place in south carolina it may be the end of the road for him _meta_end_dot_

 ps early on a lot of fred s socially conservative support moved over to huckabee but i think fred s support is now mostly comprised of rock ribbed movement conservatives _meta_end_dot_

 so if fred were to drop out huckabee might benefit a bit but i suspect most of his supporters would move over to mitt romney the pseudo conservative in the race and rudy giuliani the moderate candidate who has been beaten up the least over the last month or so _meta_end_dot_

 rudy giuliani rudy had a novel strategy he d skip the early states count on the other candidates to split the vote and keep anyone from getting too much momentum and then rudy would win florida and use his outstanding national poll numbers to sweep through super tuesday and leave the other candidates in the dust _meta_end_dot_

 three different candidates have won the first three states which plays into rudy s strategy perfectly but his national numbers have tanked and the latest pre michigan numbers essentially have a _meta_number_ref_ way tie for first in florida between rudy mccain mitt and huckabee _meta_end_dot_

 is rudy done _meta_end_question_

 no _meta_end_dot_

 in fact if he does win florida you could see his national numbers surge again and he could conceivably make his whole strategy work exactly as he planned it out _meta_end_dot_

 after all the conservative press has been mercilessly flogging huckabee for a month and mccain for about a week _meta_end_dot_

 so since rudy is the middle of the road candidate who has managed to escape criticism he may benefit from that _meta_end_dot_

 however florida is a must win state for rudy _meta_end_dot_

 he has bombed in all the previous states and has bet his entire campaign on winning florida _meta_end_dot_

 given that he has put so much on the line in that state and that his national numbers have dropped so much florida is a victory or death state for rudy s campaign _meta_end_dot_

 mike huckabee after winning iowa huckabee has only managed to put together two third place showings in new hampshire and michigan _meta_end_dot_

 however he has been in _meta_number_ref_nd place in south carolina is right in the thick of it in florida and has excellent national numbers _meta_end_dot_

 at this point it s all balanced on a knife s edge for huckabee _meta_end_dot_

 if he does well or better yet wins florida and or south carolina he could get a boost to his national numbers which would allow him to clean up on super tuesday _meta_end_dot_

 on the other hand if he finishes _meta_number_ref_rd or _meta_number_ref_th in those states which is also possible he could just as easily see his national numbers drop significantly as he s written off as a limited candidate whose appeal doesn t stretch beyond social conservatives _meta_end_dot_

 mitt romney overall mitt romney has run the strongest campaign so far with _meta_number_ref_nd place finishes in iowa and new hampshire to go along with his first place finish in michigan _meta_end_dot_

 on the other hand his early strategy was to pour resources and time into those three states win them all and slingshot to the nomination _meta_end_dot_

 so how do things stand for mitt now _meta_end_question_

 it depends on how much of a bounce he gets from michigan _meta_end_dot_

 if he gets a decent bump he could go on to win nevada where he s neck and neck with mccain and do well or maybe just maybe win south carolina where he s in third place _meta_end_dot_

 i thought mitt might be considering dropping out of the race if he lost michigan but this win has breathed new life into his campaign and has given him a real shot at capturing the nomination _meta_end_dot_

 ps the romney campaign tells me they are now running ads in south carolina so rumors that mitt might just skip the state and move on to florida are apparently unfounded _meta_end_dot_

 john mccain had mccain won last night it probably would have clinched the nomination for him but he s still looking fairly strong post michigan _meta_end_dot_

 pre michigan he was winning south carolina duking it out for the top slot in nevada with romney and in the mix for the top slot in florida _meta_end_dot_

 plus he has strong national numbers _meta_end_dot_

 on the other hand if mccain loses sc and nevada his momentum may be stopped for good since the conservative press is finally turning their attention to him _meta_end_dot_

 on the other hand victories in those states would help him a great deal and if rudy loses florida and drops out it would help mccain immensely because they draw from the same pool of moderate voters _meta_end_dot_

 that means the lion s share of rudy s support would probably move over to mccain _meta_end_dot_

 additionally the mainstream media is pushing hard for mccain and at the moment mccain is putting up far better head to head numbers against the democrats than any of the other republican candidates _meta_end_dot_

 that s a big advantage for him and it gives him a little bit of an edge over the rest of the field _meta_end_dot_

 summary it has been a really bizarre primary season _meta_end_dot_

 we have five candidates in contention _meta_end_dot_

 three of them huckabee mccain and giuliani aren t well liked by conservatives _meta_end_dot_

 then there s mitt romney who is considered to be more conservative than the other three candidates but probably can t win a general election _meta_end_dot_

 last but not least the most conservative guy in the batch a guy who has done very well in the debates who is probably the only candidate in the group who could excite conservatives in _meta_number_ref_ is running in _meta_number_ref_th place in south carolina the state that s supposed to carry conservatives on its back _meta_end_dot_

 at the moment it s almost impossible to say who s going to come out on top but after we see how things play out in south carolina and nevada we should have a better idea of whether fred s going to stick around whether huckabee is for real and whether mccain or romney can put together enough momentum to clean up on super tuesday _meta_end_dot_
