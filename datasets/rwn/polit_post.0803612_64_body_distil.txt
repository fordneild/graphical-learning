  on friday of last week i conducted a phone interview with thomas sowell about his new book economic facts and fallacies incidentally i ve just finished the book and as per usual with sowell s work it s very good _meta_end_dot_

 what follows is a slightly edited transcript of our conversation _meta_end_dot_

 we ve frequently heard and will hear much more i am sure if hillary is the democratic nominee that women make _meta_number_ref_ cents for every dollar a man makes _meta_end_dot_

 can you give us a basic rundown of why that discrepancy exists _meta_end_question_

 there are lots of reasons _meta_end_dot_

 men and women do not work the same number of hours _meta_end_dot_

 they do not work in the same occupations _meta_end_dot_

 they do not work continuously the same and so on _meta_end_dot_

 you know if it was really true that you could hire a woman for three quarters of what you could hire a man with exactly the same qualifications then employers would be crazy not to hire all women _meta_end_dot_

 it would be insane to hire men _meta_end_dot_

 not only would it be insane it would probably put them out of the business because the ones that were smart enough to hire women would have such a cost advantage that it would be really hard for the others to compete _meta_end_dot_

 there are lots of gross differences between men and women and other groups and some of them shocked me when i first started doing the research _meta_end_dot_

 for example i found that young male doctors make considerably more than young female doctors _meta_end_dot_

 but when i dug into it a little deeper i discovered that young male doctors work an average of _meta_number_ref_ hours a year more than young female doctors _meta_end_dot_

 obviously a doctor that works _meta_number_ref_ extra hours is going to make more money than the other doctor _meta_end_dot_

 one profound thing you said in the book when talking about disparities between the wages earned by white workers and minority workers in this country was that there are differences between groups all over the world so why should we expect different groups to make the same amount of money in the first place _meta_end_question_

 can you tell us a little bit more about those differences _meta_end_dot_

 i think most people have heard that there are these differences but i think that what most of them have not heard is that there are the same differences between asian americans and whites as there are between whites and blacks _meta_end_dot_

 asian american families have higher incomes than white families during downturns in the economy whites get laid off moreso than asian americans _meta_end_dot_

 among people who apply for mortgage loans whites get turned down more often than asian americans _meta_end_dot_

 whites have to resort to sub prime loans more often than asian americans _meta_end_dot_

 but most of the people who talk about these things leave out asian americans because it really kills their whole story _meta_end_dot_

 their whole story is that non whites do poorly because of white racism _meta_end_dot_

 well then if you find that there is the same disparity between asian americans and whites as there is between whites and other non whites that whole argument falls down _meta_end_dot_

 all that being said you ve also noted that if you compare apples to apples black americans and white americans earn very similar amounts _meta_end_dot_

 can you tell us about that _meta_end_question_

 well for example black married couples have had a poverty rate in single digits ever since _meta_number_ref_ even though the black population as a whole particularly blacks in the ghettos have far higher poverty rates than whites _meta_end_dot_

 so what we re really saying is that there are lifestyle differences that have profound effects on economic outcomes _meta_end_dot_

 so obviously it s not just simply the act of getting married it s that there are a whole set of commitments and values and whatnot that differentiate those who get married from those who have a more adventurous lifestyle _meta_end_dot_

 another thing we hear discussed quite a bit is that wages have been stagnant for a long time _meta_end_dot_

 you explained in your book that whether you are talking about per capita individual or per capita family wages makes a big difference in that area _meta_end_dot_

 can you tell us about that _meta_end_question_

 yeah most of the data that is thrown around is data about households or families and the problem with that is that the size of households differs over time it differs from one racial ethnic group to another and it differs from one income bracket to another _meta_end_dot_

 for example when they told me how the bottom _meta_percent_ref_ in per capita family wages weren t doing as well as the top _meta_percent_ref_ well the last time i checked there were _meta_number_ref_ million people comprising the bottom _meta_percent_ref_ of families and there were _meta_number_ref_ million people comprising the top _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 so we re really not talking about the same number of people we re talking about categories _meta_end_dot_

 one of the other problems too in talking about income brackets is that it s true that top income bracket is increasing its income faster than the bottom income bracket _meta_end_dot_

 but the joker in all this is that people are moving from one bracket to another _meta_end_dot_

 so if you follow actual flesh and blood human beings over time you find for example that people who were in the bottom _meta_percent_ref_ in per capita individual wages in _meta_number_ref_ had their incomes increase by _meta_percent_ref_ by _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 over that same span of time people who were in the top _meta_percent_ref_ had their incomes decrease by _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 so if you follow flesh and blood people over time with income tax returns as the treasury department does you find the direct opposite result of what you do if you talk about these abstract brackets _meta_end_dot_

 if we re talking about rich and poor we should be talking about rich and poor people not rich and poor brackets _meta_end_dot_

 if we have compassion we should have compassion for people not for abstract statistic categories _meta_end_dot_

 there s a rather large trade gap in this country between what we buy and what we export _meta_end_dot_

 what are the ramifications of that and should we be greatly concerned about it _meta_end_question_

 not really _meta_end_dot_

 there are circumstances in which that could be a problem and other circumstances in which it would not _meta_end_dot_

 there s nothing wonderful about having an export surplus rather than an import surplus _meta_end_dot_

 we had an export surplus throughout the great depression of the _meta_number_ref_s and we had an import surplus throughout the prosperity of the _meta_number_ref_s _meta_end_dot_

 there are all sorts of other factors that are involved that make far more of a difference _meta_end_dot_

 during his campaign for the presidency ron paul has talked a great deal about monetary policy and getting off of the gold standard _meta_end_dot_

 he blames that for a wide variety of economic ills _meta_end_dot_

 talk to us a little bit about that _meta_end_dot_

 if we went back on the gold standard tomorrow what would that do for us or do to us _meta_end_question_

 what would be the pluses and minuses of that _meta_end_question_

 oh i guess the pluses would be that you would limit the extent to which politicians could play around with the money _meta_end_dot_

 but i think that s not really at the root of the problem because the great depression got started while we were still on the gold standard _meta_end_dot_

 that doesn t save you from foolish government policies and i think foolish government policies were the real problem that caused us to get into the great depression and to take a whole decade to get out of it _meta_end_dot_

 the value of the dollar has dropped quite a bit during the bush administration _meta_end_dot_

 can you tell us about the pluses and minuses of having a weak dollar _meta_end_question_

 well the plus is that it makes american goods cheaper and therefore it encourages foreigners both to buy more american goods and to buy american securities _meta_end_dot_

 the downside is that it makes buying goods more expensive to us _meta_end_dot_

 but that s one of the ways that the import export balance tends to correct itself _meta_end_dot_

 another point you made in the book was that slavery doesn t adequately account for the break up for the black family and black on black crime _meta_end_dot_

 can you tell us why that s the case _meta_end_question_

 oh yes because the studies have been done showing that in fact most black children were raised in two parent families even under slavery itself in fact all the way through until the middle of the twentieth century _meta_end_dot_

 so i think there s no greater indictment of the welfare state than the fact that the black family held together through centuries of slavery and discrimination but fell apart in the liberal welfare state _meta_end_dot_

 the subprime mortgage crisis has been in the news quite a bit of last _meta_end_dot_

 tell us what caused the subprime mortgage problems and what we should do to fix them _meta_end_dot_

 there were any number of things that contributed to it _meta_end_dot_

 one of the things was that the fed lowered the interest rate by a tremendous amount down to about _meta_percent_ref_ and under those conditions many people thought that they could afford to buy a house and in fact they could afford to buy a house so long as the interest rates remained low and the housing prices kept rising _meta_end_dot_

 however markets go up and down and have for centuries so those who got themselves out on a limb got themselves in deep trouble in part because of that _meta_end_dot_

 the government was also at the same time leaning on lenders to lend to people they would not lend to otherwise particularly under the community reinvestment act that empowered politicians to tell lenders that they ought to put so much money here rather than there as if politicians know better which they don t _meta_end_dot_

 between those two things you had a lot of people out there in very dicey situations and now the politicians are saying that they want to ride to the rescue _meta_end_dot_

 well heavens they created the problem and i can only imagine that they re going to make it worse the more they intervene _meta_end_dot_

 it was also very interesting to read in your book some of the facts and fallacies about the poorest _meta_percent_ref_ of americans _meta_end_dot_

 can you tell us why most but not all of the poorest _meta_percent_ref_ of americans are poor _meta_end_question_

 again we have to distinguish between statistics and people _meta_end_dot_

 of course most of the people who are in the bottom _meta_percent_ref_ at a given time are gone inside of a decade _meta_end_dot_

 they don t spend their lives down there _meta_end_dot_

 a lot of them are just young people starting off in their careers and this is one of the reasons income for that particular set of people nearly doubles in a decade _meta_end_dot_

 other people who are down there are down there for another reason _meta_end_dot_

 there are people who have already been up in higher brackets and are down there because they have an off year for example business people _meta_end_dot_

 a millionaire can have an off year and lose money _meta_end_dot_

 one of the things that struck me immediately was how many i think its hundreds of thousands of people who earn less than _meta_dollor_ref_k a year and are living in homes that cost _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ and up _meta_end_dot_

 obviously if this is a permanent situation it seems very odd that so many people could afford those kind of houses _meta_end_dot_

 but if you live in that kind of house and you have an off year and your income drops for that one year it s perfectly understandable how that can happen _meta_end_dot_

 another fascinating thing in the book was where you talked about the statistical fallacy that leads some people to declare that the middle class is vanishing _meta_end_dot_

 can you talk to us about that how people get the false impression that the middle class is vanishing _meta_end_question_

 oh my it s so simple that it s hard to explain _meta_end_dot_

 if you take some fixed amount of income and you say that people between these two sets of income we ll call that the middle class _meta_end_dot_

 fine _meta_end_dot_

 but what happens over time is that the average income in the country increases and so the whole distribution of income moves to the right and now there are fewer people in those fixed brackets _meta_end_dot_

 of course what that really means is that the middle class is having a higher income _meta_end_dot_

 this is how people create hysteria saying the middle class is vanishing and there will be nobody but the few rich and the masses of the poor etc etc _meta_end_dot_

 once people particularly on the left find something that fits their preconceptions they grab it and run with it _meta_end_dot_

 they don t investigate any further _meta_end_dot_

 how much of a positive difference does foreign aid transferred from the first world to the third world tend to make and if it doesn t tend to make a significant positive difference can you tell us why that might be _meta_end_question_

 oh it doesn t in fact some have argued that it makes things worse in the sense that for example the so called forgiveness of loans _meta_end_dot_

 well if you think that financial irresponsibility is a way for a country to become more prosperous that is a tragic mistake _meta_end_dot_

 there is so much more money available in the private market place than there is from these foreign aid things _meta_end_dot_

 but if you cut off all foreign aid the difference is that the governments of these countries would have to reduce the corruption they d have to reduce the red tape in order to attract private money but they d be able to attract several times as much _meta_end_dot_

 these politicians much prefer to get a certain amount of blank check money that they can use for corruption or whatever they want to use it for rather than getting a much larger amount of money from international markets where they d really have to clean up their acts in order to get it _meta_end_dot_

 give us an economic fallacy that conservatives tend to believe _meta_end_dot_

 there are some conservatives for example who are arguing that we are losing jobs to our overseas competitors and therefore the government should step in to stop that _meta_end_dot_

 what bothers me when people talk this way whether they re conservatives or liberals is that they never compare how many american jobs are going overseas with how many overseas jobs are coming to the united states _meta_end_dot_

 i mean toyota i don t know how many tens of thousands of people are manufacturing toyotas right here in the united states _meta_end_dot_

 siemens honda all kinds of other companies have american employees just as american companies employ people overseas _meta_end_dot_

 but again in order to have some kind of rational discussion about that you d have to compare the number of jobs and take other factors into account too _meta_end_dot_

 if the country becomes more prosperous as a result of this there will be more domestic jobs in the united states _meta_end_dot_

 so even if we lost jobs on net balance in terms of movement in and out we d still have more jobs than we would have without all this process _meta_end_dot_

 it troubles me that very few people even attempt to weigh how many jobs we wouldn t have except for this outsourcing in both directions _meta_end_dot_

 can you tell us a little bit about your new book economic facts and fallacies _meta_end_question_

 oh heavens i couldn t hope to cover all the fallacies so what i wanted to do was pick out a few and look at them in depth mainly to show how plausible a fallacy can sound when you first hear it and how it can collapse like a house of cards when you look below the surface _meta_end_dot_

 the biggest fallacy in terms of being the foundation of other fallacies is what i call the zero sum fallacy _meta_end_dot_

 that s the notion if one party gains the other party must lose when in fact it would make absolutely no sense for the transaction to go on voluntarily unless both parties gained _meta_end_dot_

 mr _meta_end_dot_

 sowell i really appreciate your time _meta_end_dot_

 thank you very much _meta_end_dot_

 goodbye _meta_end_dot_
