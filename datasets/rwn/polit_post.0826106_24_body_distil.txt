  the enduring scandal of the mccain campaign is that it wants to win _meta_end_dot_

 the press had hoped for a harmless nostalgic loser like bob dole in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 in a column excoriating republicans for historically launching successful attacks against democratic presidential candidates in august time columnist joe klein excepted bob dole not mentioning that dole had been eviscerated by clinton negative ads before august ever arrived rich lowry the same press that showered john mccain with love and affection for _meta_number_ref_ years now hates him with a passion _meta_end_dot_

 in order to explain it they re pointing to particular campaign ads or just saying that he s changed _meta_end_dot_

 of course that s not true _meta_end_dot_

 mccain isn t roughing up barack obama one bit harder than he smacked around mitt romney during the primaries back when the mainstream media still loved him _meta_end_dot_

 the press has turned on mccain because instead of attacking other republicans he s representing the republicans now and actually winning a race that the liberal press arrogantly believed their candidate couldn t lose _meta_end_dot_

 this is no surprise to anyone who pays attention to the mainstream media _meta_end_dot_

 in fact back on march _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ i wrote a piece called the conservative case against john mccain in _meta_number_ref_ in it i opined that the mainstream media loves john mccain and they regularly write fawning articles referring to him as a maverick and a straight talker because of this mccain polls well among democrats and independents _meta_end_dot_

 however the reason mccain is so well liked by the media is because they re liberals and they love it when he trashes other republicans _meta_end_dot_

 but what would happen if john mccain actually became the republican nominee _meta_end_question_

 the same members of the mainstream media who gush over him today would turn on him in a minnesota minute and once his great press ended his poll numbers with independents and democrats would start to drop precipitously so far mccain s numbers with dems and independents are doing better than i expected because of the vicious democratic primary fight the weakness of obama as a candidate and the selection of sarah palin _meta_end_dot_

 however the media has done everything that they could to tear mccain down to the ground _meta_end_dot_

 how could i and many other people have predicted that _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ years ago unless that s right the media is every bit as liberal and biased against us as we conservatives say it is _meta_end_question_

 the question practically answers itself _meta_end_dot_
