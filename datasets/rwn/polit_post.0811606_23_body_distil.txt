  although i m supporting john mccain for president in _meta_number_ref_ i have to admit that i d rather see hillary clinton as his opponent _meta_end_dot_

 that s not because i think she d be a weaker candidate it s because i d love to see that smug tin god barack obama humbled and forced to taste bitter defeat at hillary s hands _meta_end_dot_

 ironically just a few months ago i would loved to have seen hillary beaten by barack because she seemed to have such a sense of entitlement about the democratic nomination _meta_end_dot_

 so now the shoe is completely on the other foot _meta_end_dot_

 come to think of it that may be barack obama s only significant accomplishment he has been the first democrat who has ever made conservatives see any good at all in hillary clinton _meta_end_dot_

 additionally in the spirit of operation chaos i d like to see the democratic fight over the nomination be as long and bloody as possible _meta_end_dot_

 moreover believe it or not i have developed the slightest twinge of sympathy for the devil since the mainstream media has started treating her like an honorary republican for daring to try to defeat obama _meta_end_dot_

 so when the msm essentially adopts the obama campaign s position and argues that hillary should get out now even though she can still win i feel the chivalrous urge counter productive though it may be to defend her just a bit especially since hillary clinton does have a very strong case to make to the democratic superdelegates who will decide the winner of the race _meta_end_dot_

 what case would that be _meta_end_question_

 well _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ hillary s voters are more likely to defect to mccain than obama voters are if their candidate doesn t get the nod _meta_end_dot_

 in fact according to a gallup poll last month _meta_percent_ref_ of obama voters would vote for mccain if barack lost but _meta_percent_ref_ of hillary s voters would do the same if the situation were reversed _meta_end_dot_

 of course the percentages wouldn t turn out to be that high but however you slice it the conventional wisdom about obama s supporters being the ones that sit home or defect if he loses appears to be wrong _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ according to a study done at yale i n house races white democrats are _meta_number_ref_ percentage points less likely to vote democratic if their candidate is black think about those numbers and then consider that mccain is a moderate who may genuinely appeal to many white middle of the road democratic voters and that obama has refused to disavow his connection with anti white racist jeremiah wright _meta_end_dot_

 it s not a pretty picture for obama is it _meta_end_question_

 _meta_number_ref_ in a number of states including pennsylvania barack did significantly worse than his poll numbers indicated that he would _meta_end_dot_

 what that suggests is that there is a bradley effect happening in large swathes of the country that is making obama s numbers look _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ points higher than they are in reality _meta_end_dot_

 take away that bump especially in key states like pennsylvania and obama would clearly be a weaker candidate against mccain than hillary clinton _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ hillary has beaten obama in the large swing states like pennsylvania michigan florida and ohio _meta_end_dot_

 chances are these states are going to decide who the winner of the _meta_number_ref_ election is and hillary seems to be running stronger in all of them than barack so far _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ in a republican winner take all system hillary would be ahead of obama _meta_end_dot_

 granted if wishes were horses then beggars would ride but it s still worth noting that barack only has more delegates than hillary because he has managed to game the democrats wacky primary system _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ despite the fact that obama is raising more money than hillary she is still out raising mccain _meta_end_dot_

 moreover given that hillary is beating obama in states where he s outspending her by a considerable margin _meta_number_ref_ to _meta_number_ref_ in pennsylvania for example you have to question whether obama s fundraising prowess will turn out to be any more important than howard s dean knack for raising cash was in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ although hillary has a lot more baggage than obama she has also proven to be much more adept at dealing with scandal than barack _meta_end_dot_

 keep in mind that we re talking about a guy who was so stunned by getting a few tough questions at an abc debate that he cancelled his next debate in north carolina _meta_end_dot_

 for all her faults hillary has proven that she can take the heat while barack has looked like a bumbling wimp under fire _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ obama who hasn t even completed a single term in the senate comes across as unqualified when he s up against a man with as much experience as mccain especially if voters are worried about a _meta_number_ref_ am crisis _meta_end_dot_

 on the other hand hillary has completed a term in the senate has been re elected and since her husband was president voters will give her some credit for his experience _meta_end_dot_

 mccain would still have an advantage over hillary in the experience category but many more voters would consider her to be at least qualified to do the job in the first place _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ if obama wins the democratic nomination it will only be because black voters overwhelmingly voted for him because he is black _meta_end_dot_

 that has been his ace in the hole so far but it would mean nothing in a general election because black voters already break _meta_percent_ref_ towards the democrats anyway _meta_end_dot_

 his other potent voting block young voters are notoriously unreliable _meta_end_dot_

 today they may be pulling the lever for obama but in november they may be too busy playing video games to show up and vote _meta_end_dot_

 on the other hand hillary s strongest voting blocks white women and older white voters do show up to vote and they re much more up for grabs in a general election than obama s core supporters _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ hillary is arguing that if you count the vote totals in michigan and florida and haven t democrats been saying count every vote then she has a lead on obama in the popular vote _meta_end_dot_

 so if the superdelegates want to respect the will of the people shouldn t hillary be their choice _meta_end_question_
