  here s a little context about the number of active duty soldiers we re losing each year that you re probably not going to see on the evening news tonight _meta_end_dot_

 actually less soldiers are being killed each year during the bush administration during a war on terrorism than we were losing during the reagan or bush administration ronald reagan _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ avg per year bill clinton _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ avg per year if we re losing less soldiers per year than we were during the reagan or bush _meta_number_ref_ administrations when people didn t seem to think it was a crisis are our losses really unsustainable or breaking the military although it s always tragic when any american soldier doesn t come home to his family by any historical standard the answer to that question would seem to be no ps if you re wondering why we re losing less soldiers per year now than we did under the reagan or bush _meta_number_ref_ administrations it s primarily because the military was significantly bigger back then and because a lot more of our troops were dying via accidents _meta_end_dot_
