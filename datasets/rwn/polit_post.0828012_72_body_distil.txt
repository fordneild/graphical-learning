  al gore tells lies about the climate as fast as they can be debunked _meta_end_dot_

 now he wants us to believe that nonexistent global warming is causing more powerful tornadoes and floods _meta_end_dot_

 proclaims the goracle yes we ve always had tornadoes in iowa and in tennessee _meta_end_dot_

 but they re coming more frequently and they re stronger _meta_end_dot_

 via watts up with that the following graph from the nws noaa confirms that the number of severe tornadoes has been going down since the early _meta_number_ref_s _meta_end_dot_

 the trend for reported tornadoes overall is up but that s only because improved technology and increased obsession with the weather has led to better reporting of minor incidents gore also claims that recent flooding in iowa was caused by global warming driving up the humidity _meta_end_dot_

 but water vapor only stays in the air for _meta_number_ref_ days whereas it has been _meta_number_ref_ years since it s gotten any warmer as university of alabama huntsville confirms as always gore s lies are demonstrably false _meta_end_dot_

 nonetheless a complicit media can be counted on to exploit them as further justification for our economy to be hamstrung and our liberties suspended _meta_end_dot_

 meanwhile john mccain promises to bring gore into his administration to wreak havoc in the name of the global warming farce asked if he would be a visible presence in international talks to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and replace the kyoto protocol mccain who has clashed with fellow republicans over climate change said he would do whatever is necessary to try to move forward he said he would involve former vice president al gore in efforts to address the issue _meta_end_dot_

 i would tap him i would tap people who have been involved in these issues for many years i have great respect for al gore incredibly mccain is the less unthinkable of our presidential alternatives _meta_end_dot_

 the goracle s nose continues to grow _meta_end_dot_
