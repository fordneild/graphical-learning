  if liberals want to sterilize themselves to protect the planet i say more power to them meet the women who won t have babies because they re not eco friendly had toni vernelli gone ahead with her pregnancy ten years ago she would know at first hand what it is like to cradle her own baby to have a pair of innocent eyes gazing up at her with unconditional love to feel a little hand slipping into hers and a voice calling her mummy _meta_end_dot_

 but the very thought makes her shudder with horror _meta_end_dot_

 because when toni terminated her pregnancy she did so in the firm belief she was helping to save the planet _meta_end_dot_

 incredibly so determined was she that the terrible mistake of pregnancy should never happen again that she begged the doctor who performed the abortion to sterilise her at the same time _meta_end_dot_

 he refused but toni who works for an environmental charity relentlessly hunted down a doctor who would perform the irreversible surgery _meta_end_dot_

 finally eight years ago toni got her way _meta_end_dot_

 at the age of _meta_number_ref_ this young woman at the height of her reproductive years was sterilised to protect the planet _meta_end_dot_

 incredibly instead of mourning the loss of a family that never was her boyfriend now husband presented her with a congratulations card _meta_end_dot_

 while some might think it strange to celebrate the reversal of nature and denial of motherhood toni relishes her decision with an almost religious zeal _meta_end_dot_

 having children is selfish _meta_end_dot_

 it s all about maintaining your genetic line at the expense of the planet says toni _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 personally i oppose abortion and think it s dumb to sterilize yourself because you re worried about the planet but if liberals want to breed themselves out of existence who am i to criticize them _meta_end_question_

 better them than us _meta_end_dot_
