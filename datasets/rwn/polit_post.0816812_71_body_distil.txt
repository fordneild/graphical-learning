  so barack obama gave a resounding sermon in a church not jeremiah wright s on father s day sunday about the importance of fathers _meta_end_dot_

 the black community suffers disproportionately with fatherlessness and the results of this cultural phenomenon manifest many many social ills from crime to drug use to drop out rates to incarceration to teenage pregnancy etc _meta_end_dot_

 it s a mess _meta_end_dot_

 obama s speech included some gems don t get carried away with that eighth grade graduation he said bringing many members of the congregation to their feet applauding _meta_end_dot_

 you re supposed to graduate from eighth grade his themes have been also been sounded by the comedian bill cosby who has stirred debate among black americans by bluntly speaking about an epidemic of fatherless african american families while suggesting that some blacks use racism as a crutch to explain lack of economic progress _meta_end_dot_

 john hawkins quips clap clap clap _meta_end_dot_

 i guess even a blind squirrel grabs a nut every once in a while _meta_end_dot_

 but earlier hawkins called the speech spot on _meta_end_dot_

 well the speech might have been spot on but it s the actions of the candidate that matter most and i m not thrilled with how obama proposes to solve the problem that has been a scourge in the community on friday mr _meta_end_dot_

 obama announced that he would be a co sponsor of a bill with senator evan bayh democrat of indiana that his campaign said would address the national epidemic of absentee fathers if passed the legislation would increase the enforcement of child support payments and strengthen domestic violence prevention services _meta_end_dot_

 mr _meta_end_dot_

 obama cited the need for stronger law enforcement services and resources for education more job opportunities and other resources for communities _meta_end_dot_

 laws already exist to encourage enforcement of child support _meta_end_dot_

 laws already exist to address domestic violence _meta_end_dot_

 how does any of this get men back with their families _meta_end_question_

 obama was in a church after all _meta_end_dot_

 he could have spoken about the moral failings of the community because surely that s what s lacking _meta_end_dot_

 the cycle is vicious _meta_end_dot_

 part of the problem is a simply a lack of supervision _meta_end_dot_

 children have a working mom come home to an empty house _meta_end_dot_

 they are hungry and lonely _meta_end_dot_

 they eat junk and they seek comfort _meta_end_dot_

 a girl gets pregnant too young _meta_end_dot_

 now we can talk about birth control but even if it s being used a _meta_number_ref_ year old girl is extraordinarily fertile so any slip up will likely result in a baby _meta_end_dot_

 she has to choose between abortion or a child _meta_end_dot_

 she will be making a life changing decision either way _meta_end_dot_

 if she chooses to have the child she will likely not be in the position to marry _meta_end_dot_

 she s in high school _meta_end_dot_

 the father is probably a boy too _meta_end_dot_

 how will he support her _meta_end_question_

 what does he have to offer at that point _meta_end_question_

 and then he s going to go work make minimum wage and the government is going to come after him _meta_end_question_

 reversing the problem means finding an adequate substitute for the lack of a father now in this generation _meta_end_dot_

 the hopelessness and loneliness the lack of discipline and structure when the mother is gone needs to be filled somehow _meta_end_dot_

 the government is woefully inadequate at finding solutions that require essentially love _meta_end_dot_

 churches though are really good at this _meta_end_dot_

 the problem i m wondering at is whether the mothers want their children to hear that premarital sex is a moral failure _meta_end_dot_

 it will indict them _meta_end_dot_

 when pastors like jeremiah wright externalize blame on the government and white people generally the congregants feel better but don t look within _meta_end_dot_

 but the fact is the problems within the family both black and white are moral in nature and won t be solved by blaming someone else _meta_end_dot_

 only when women and men take responsibility will things get better but personal responsibility isn t a very sexy message _meta_end_dot_

 enforcing child support may ease the difficulty of daily lives for the women trying to raise children _meta_end_dot_

 just paying for child care straps single mothers who have to work to pay for food and shelter _meta_end_dot_

 still it doesn t solve the underlying problem _meta_end_dot_

 will liberals start sharing the uncomfortable message of abstinence personal responsibility self sacrifice delaying gratification etc _meta_end_question_

 somehow i doubt it _meta_end_dot_

 it goes against all their ideals and actually runs directly counter to their policies of intervening so a person doesn t have to deal with the consequences of bad decisions _meta_end_dot_

 the liberal message is all about self gratification and indulgence _meta_end_dot_

 as usual obama s words are pretty but his actions are the same old same old _meta_end_dot_
