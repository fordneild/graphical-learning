  i m sure you heard about _meta_number_ref_ soldiers being killed in afghanistan a couple of weeks ago _meta_end_dot_

 as ap reported it it was a setback the newly established base there was abandoned by the americans _meta_end_dot_

 that of course was the extent of their coverage _meta_end_dot_

 steve mraz of stars and stripes and jeff emanuel tell the rest of the story _meta_end_dot_

 emanuel who went out and dug into the story sets the enemy force at _meta_number_ref_ while ap sets it at _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 frankly i m much more inclined to believe emanuel than ap _meta_end_dot_

 july _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ was the date and jeff emanuel an independent combat reporter sets the scene three days before the attack _meta_number_ref_ u s _meta_end_dot_

 paratroopers from the _meta_number_ref_d airborne brigade combat team accompanied by _meta_number_ref_ afghan soldiers made their way to kunar province a remote area in the northeastern afghanistan pakistan border area and established the beginnings of a small combat outpost cop _meta_end_dot_

 their movement into the area was noticed and their tiny numbers and incomplete fortifications were quickly taken advantage of _meta_end_dot_

 a combined force of up to _meta_number_ref_ taliban and al qaeda fighters quickly moved into the nearby village of wanat and prepared for their assault by evicting unallied residents and according to an anonymous senior afghan defense ministry official us ing their houses to attack us tribesmen in the town stayed behind and helped the insurgents during the fight the provincial police chief told the associated press _meta_end_dot_

 dug in mortar firing positions were created and with that indirect fire as well as heavy machine gun and rpg fire from fixed positions taliban and al qaeda fighters rushed the cop from three sides _meta_end_dot_

 as emanuel notes the odds were set _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ vs _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 even so emanuel entitled his article an alamo with a different ending the _meta_number_ref_ terrorists apparently didn t realize they were attacking us army paratroopers _meta_end_dot_

 the unit in question was _meta_number_ref_nd platoon company c _meta_number_ref_nd battalion _meta_number_ref_rd infantry regiment airborne _meta_number_ref_rd airborne brigade combat team led by _meta_number_ref_lt jonathan brostrom _meta_end_dot_

 the first rpg and machine gun fire came at dawn strategically striking the forward operating base s mortar pit _meta_end_dot_

 the insurgents next sighted their rpgs on the tow truck inside the combat outpost taking it out _meta_end_dot_

 that was around _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ a m _meta_end_dot_

 this was not a haphazard attack _meta_end_dot_

 the reportedly _meta_number_ref_ insurgents fought from several positions _meta_end_dot_

 they aimed to overrun the new base _meta_end_dot_

 the u s _meta_end_dot_

 soldiers knew it and fought like hell _meta_end_dot_

 they knew their lives were on the line _meta_end_dot_

 the next target was the fob s observation post where nine soldiers were positioned on a tiny hill about _meta_number_ref_ to _meta_number_ref_ meters from the base _meta_end_dot_

 of those nine five died and at least three others spc _meta_end_dot_

 tyler stafford among them were wounded _meta_end_dot_

 when the attack began stafford grabbed his m _meta_number_ref_ machine gun off a north facing sandbag wall and moved it to an east facing sandbag wall _meta_end_dot_

 moments later rpgs struck the north facing wall knocking stafford out of the fighting position and wounding another soldier _meta_end_dot_

 stafford thought he was on fire so he rolled around regaining his senses _meta_end_dot_

 nearby cpl _meta_end_dot_

 gunnar zwilling who later died in the fight had a stunned look on his face _meta_end_dot_

 immediately a grenade exploded by stafford blowing him down to a lower terrace at the observation post and knocking his helmet off _meta_end_dot_

 stafford put his helmet back on and noticed how badly he was bleeding _meta_end_dot_

 cpl _meta_end_dot_

 matthew phillips was close by so stafford called to him for help _meta_end_dot_

 phillips was preparing to throw a grenade and shot a look at stafford that said give me a second _meta_end_dot_

 i gotta go kill these guys first this was only about _meta_number_ref_ to _meta_number_ref_ seconds into the attack _meta_end_dot_

 kneeling behind a sandbag wall phillips pulled the grenade pin but just after he threw it an rpg exploded at his position _meta_end_dot_

 the tail of the rpg smacked stafford s helmet _meta_end_dot_

 the dust cleared _meta_end_dot_

 phillips was slumped over his chest on his knees and his hands by his side _meta_end_dot_

 stafford called out to his buddy three or four times but phillips never answered or moved _meta_end_dot_

 when i saw phillips die i looked down and was bleeding pretty good that s probably the most scared i was at any point stafford said _meta_end_dot_

 then i kinda had to calm myself down and be like all right i gotta go try to do my job the soldier from parker colo loaded his _meta_number_ref_ mm handgun crawled up to their fighting position stuck the pistol over the sandbags and fired _meta_end_dot_

 stafford saw zwilling s m _meta_number_ref_ rifle nearby so he loaded it put it on top of the sandbag and fired _meta_end_dot_

 another couple rpgs struck the sandbag wall stafford used as cover _meta_end_dot_

 shrapnel pierced his hands _meta_end_dot_

 stafford low crawled to another fighting position where cpl _meta_end_dot_

 jason bogar sgt _meta_end_dot_

 matthew gobble and sgt _meta_end_dot_

 ryan pitts were located _meta_end_dot_

 stafford told pitts that the insurgents were within grenade tossing range _meta_end_dot_

 that got pitts attention _meta_end_dot_

 with blood running down his face pitts threw a grenade and then crawled to the position from where stafford had just come _meta_end_dot_

 pitts started chucking more grenades _meta_end_dot_

 the firefight intensified _meta_end_dot_

 bullets cut down tree limbs that fell on the soldiers _meta_end_dot_

 rpgs constantly exploded _meta_end_dot_

 back at stafford s position so many bullets were coming in that the soldiers could not poke their heads over their sandbag wall _meta_end_dot_

 bogar stuck an m _meta_number_ref_ machine gun above the wall and squeezed off rounds to keep fire on the insurgents _meta_end_dot_

 in about five minutes bogar fired about _meta_number_ref_ rounds causing the m _meta_number_ref_ to seize up from heat _meta_end_dot_

 at another spot on the observation post cpl _meta_end_dot_

 jonathan ayers laid down continuous fire from an m _meta_number_ref_ machine gun despite drawing small arms and rpg fire from the enemy _meta_end_dot_

 ayers kept firing until he was shot and killed _meta_end_dot_

 cpl _meta_end_dot_

 pruitt rainey radioed the fob with a casualty report calling for help _meta_end_dot_

 of the nine soldiers at the observation post ayers and phillips were dead zwilling was unaccounted for and three were wounded _meta_end_dot_

 additionally several of the soldiers machine guns couldn t fire because of damage _meta_end_dot_

 and they needed more ammo _meta_end_dot_

 rainey bogar and another soldier jumped out of their fighting position with the third soldier of the group launching a shoulder fired missile _meta_end_dot_

 all this happened within the first _meta_number_ref_ minutes of the fight _meta_end_dot_

 platoon leader _meta_number_ref_st lt _meta_end_dot_

 jonathan brostrom and cpl _meta_end_dot_

 jason hovater arrived at the observation post to reinforce the soldiers _meta_end_dot_

 by that time the insurgents had breached the perimeter of the observation post _meta_end_dot_

 gunfire rang out and rainey shouted he s right behind the sandbag brostrom could be heard shouting about the insurgent as well _meta_end_dot_

 more gunfire and grenade explosions ensued _meta_end_dot_

 back in the fighting position gobble fired a few quick rounds _meta_end_dot_

 gobble then looked to where the soldiers were fighting and told stafford the soldiers were dead _meta_end_dot_

 of the nine soldiers who died in the battle at least seven fell in fighting at the observation post _meta_end_dot_

 the insurgents then started chucking rocks at gobble and stafford s fighting position hoping that the soldiers might think the rocks were grenades causing them to jump from the safety of their fighting hole _meta_end_dot_

 one rock hit a tree behind stafford and landed directly between his legs _meta_end_dot_

 he braced himself for an explosion _meta_end_dot_

 he then realized it was a rock _meta_end_dot_

 gobble told stafford they had to get back to the fob _meta_end_dot_

 they didn t realize that pitts was still alive in another fighting position at the observation post _meta_end_dot_

 gobble and stafford crawled out of their fighting hole _meta_end_dot_

 gobble looked again to where the soldiers had been fighting and reconfirmed to stafford that brostrom rainey bogar and others were dead _meta_end_dot_

 gobble and stafford low crawled and ran back to the fob _meta_end_dot_

 coming into the fob stafford was asked by a sergeant what was going on at the observation post _meta_end_dot_

 stafford told him all the soldiers there were dead _meta_end_dot_

 stafford lay against a wall and his fellow soldiers put a tourniquet on him _meta_end_dot_

 from the op pitts got on the radio and told his comrades he was alone _meta_end_dot_

 volunteers were asked for to go to the op _meta_end_dot_

 ssg jesse queck sums up the reaction to the call when you ask for volunteers to run across an open field to a reinforced op that almost everybody is injured at and everybody volunteers it feels good _meta_end_dot_

 there were a lot of guys that made me proud putting themselves and their lives on the line so their buddies could have a chance at least three soldiers went to the op to rescue pitts but they suffered wounds after encountering rpg and small arms fire but pitts survived the battle _meta_end_dot_

 at that time air support arrived in the form of apache helicopters a _meta_number_ref_s and f _meta_number_ref_s performing bombing and strafing runs _meta_end_dot_

 the whole fob was covered in dust and smoke looking like something out of an old western movie _meta_end_dot_

 i ve never seen the enemy do anything like that said sgt _meta_end_dot_

 jacob walker who was medically evacuated off the fob in one of the first helicopters to arrive _meta_end_dot_

 it s usually three rpgs some sporadic fire and then they re gone _meta_end_dot_

 i don t where they got all those rpgs _meta_end_dot_

 that was crazy two hours after the first shots were fired stafford made his way with help to the medevac helicopter that arrived _meta_end_dot_

 it was some of the bravest stuff i ve ever seen in my life and i will never see it again because those guys stafford said then paused _meta_end_dot_

 normal humans wouldn t do that _meta_end_dot_

 you re not supposed to do that getting up and firing back when everything around you is popping and whizzing and trees branches coming down and sandbags exploding and rpgs coming in over your head _meta_end_dot_

 it was a fistfight then and those guys held em off stafford offered a guess as to why his fellow soldiers fought so hard _meta_end_dot_

 just hardcoreness i guess he said _meta_end_dot_

 just guys kicking ass basically _meta_end_dot_

 just making sure that we look scary enough that you don t want to come in and try to get us jeff emanuel summed the fight up very well perhaps the most important takeaway from that encounter though is the one that the mainstream media couldn t be bothered to pay attention long enough to learn that not for the first time a contingent of american soldiers that was outnumbered by up to a twenty to one ratio soundly and completely repulsed a complex pre planned assault by those dedicated enough to their cause to kill themselves in its pursuit _meta_end_dot_

 that kind of heroism and against all odds success is and has been a hallmark of america s fighting men and women and it is one that is worthy of all attention we can possibly give it of the original _meta_number_ref_ paratroopers _meta_number_ref_ were wounded and the sky soldiers lost _meta_number_ref_ killed in action in the attack _meta_end_dot_

 they were _meta_number_ref_lt jonathan brostrom of aiea hawaii spc matthew phillips of jasper georgia spc jonathan ayers of snellville georgia spc sergio abad of morganfield kentucky spc gunnar zwilling of florissant missouri of the _meta_number_ref_ that were lost sgt walker says i just hope these guys wives and their children understand how courageous their husbands and dads were _meta_end_dot_

 they fought like warriors they fought like warriors _meta_end_dot_

 last week there were _meta_number_ref_ funerals in the united states _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ warriors were laid to rest _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ warriors who had given their all for their country _meta_end_dot_

 all proud members of a brotherhood that will carry on in their name _meta_end_dot_

 they fought and died in what most would consider impossible circumstances and yet they succeeded _meta_end_dot_

 a nameless fight in a distant war which until you understand the facts could be spun as a defeat _meta_end_dot_

 it wasn t _meta_end_dot_

 and it is because of the pride courage and fighting spirit of this small unit that it was in fact a victory against overwhelming odds _meta_end_dot_

 and there s little doubt given that pride and given that fighting spirit that they ll be back to reestablish the base this time with quite a few more soldiers just like the ones who kicked ass the last time there _meta_end_dot_
