  and what is the cause _meta_end_question_

 the cause quite simply is money _meta_end_dot_

 money is the root of all evil _meta_end_dot_

 well that s certainly the case in washington d c _meta_end_dot_

 where congress seems to believe that your hands on your money is evil while their hands on your money is good _meta_end_dot_

 the republicans have one issue that nearly every voter can agree on the federal government stinks at knowing what the heck to do with your money and shouldn t get a dime more _meta_end_dot_

 let me rephrase that the republicans had one issue that unified voters of every stripe _meta_end_dot_

 not now _meta_end_dot_

 republicans have sold out the country and their voters by spending like drunken liberals _meta_end_dot_

 so now the democratic congress wants to raise taxes but they need enablers from across the aisle and you can count on moderate republicans to enable _meta_end_dot_

 soren dayton notes a bad day for don young is a good day for america _meta_end_dot_

 thank you to grover norquist for helping to deliver a bad day to young by declaring him a tax pledge violator don young r alaska violated the solemn oath he took to his constituents by voting for h r _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ the blue dog tax hike _meta_end_dot_

 republicans that vote for tax increases are like rat heads in coke bottles said grover norquist president of americans for tax reform _meta_end_dot_

 they ruin the republican brand for all members _meta_end_dot_

 it should be readily apparent to a former hero of the taxpayer award recipient that you don t vote for tax hikes bless grover s heart _meta_end_dot_

 and give money to sean parnell _meta_end_dot_

 go grover _meta_end_exclamation_

 but the bigger issue remains republicans have lost credibility with voters because of how they have spent and behaved with america s money _meta_end_dot_

 and they just don t get it _meta_end_dot_

 and they will lose elections because they just don t get it _meta_end_dot_

 you know why _meta_end_question_

 because americans can elect democrats if they want gluttonous fat cats spending their money _meta_end_dot_

 republicans need to catch a clue _meta_end_dot_

 and mccain needs to lead the charge by simplifying his blathering _meta_end_dot_

 he needs to repeat a couple mantras instead of mumbling vague policies _meta_end_dot_

 keep it simple john stop taxes win wars this isn t rocket science i swear _meta_end_dot_

 but when republicans undercut their core principle by acting well unprincipled people hate them _meta_end_dot_

 there is a reason congress has a _meta_percent_ref_ approval rating and republicans contribute to the disapproval because they re acting like democrats _meta_end_dot_

 who needs republicans when they act like democrats _meta_end_question_

 that s what voters are asking themselves _meta_end_dot_

 conservative republicans get apathetic and stop giving money to campaigns because they re disgusted with the whole lot of them _meta_end_dot_

 well i do believe there are good solid fiscally conservative people in congress and running for congress and they deserve support like soren mentions _meta_end_dot_

 but the republican leadership have a lot of work to do to win over their voters _meta_end_dot_

 they need to start speaking the principles and more importantly acting on them _meta_end_dot_

 cross posted at melissaclouthier com where i also have big post obasmic round up _meta_end_dot_

 cigarettes anyone _meta_end_question_
