  jeb hensarling over at the very conservative republican study committee outlined an agenda he thinks that the house republicans should pursue _meta_end_dot_

 here it is an action plan for house republicans bold simple and different than the democrats _meta_number_ref_ the end of pork barrel spending house republicans are committed to ending pork barrel spending _meta_end_dot_

 we will not wait on the democrat majority to end bridges to nowhere and monuments to me we declare an immediate earmark moratorium and pledge to reform the system _meta_end_dot_

 we also pledge to uphold any future veto of a non defense spending bill that is pork laden and does not lead to a balanced budget _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ limiting washington taxes and spending to what middle class families can afford house republicans are committed to eliminating the alternative minimum tax and preventing the scheduled tax increases in _meta_number_ref_ from taking more from the paychecks of hard working middle class families _meta_end_dot_

 we are also committed to amending the u s _meta_end_dot_

 constitution to limit the growth of federal spending to the level at which middle class americans can afford _meta_end_dot_

 except in time of war or national emergency our spending limit amendment would prohibit federal spending from growing faster than the economy _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ a fair simple tax code that americans can understand house republicans are committed to ending a tax code that is too long too complex and too unfair _meta_end_dot_

 specifically our legislation would provide comprehensive individual income tax reform by providing individuals an alternative two tier flat tax system that can be filed on one page _meta_end_dot_

 taxpayers can choose the new simplified system or stay with the current tax code whichever option suits them _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ a family focused patient centered health care system house republicans will reform and improve our current health care system by _meta_number_ref_ providing a refundable health care tax credit to every american to purchase affordable health care coverage and _meta_number_ref_ broadening the array of choice for health insurance plans by allowing individuals to purchase plans available in other states _meta_end_dot_

 these measures will allow americans who like their current health plan to keep it while encouraging all individuals to own a personal and portable health insurance policy _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ american energy independence through increased exploration house republicans are committed to increasing american energy supplies to lower prices and reduce dependence on middle eastern oil by allowing energy exploration in alaska and the outer continental shelf as well as the development of cleaner coal technologies and alternative fuels _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ a legal framework that allows us to prevent terrorist attacks house republicans are committed to preventing terrorists from attacking america _meta_end_dot_

 house republicans will empower our intelligence agencies to intercept terrorist communications with sources outside of the united states without the lengthy process of getting a warrant that could jeopardize the ability to thwart an attack _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ a moral approach for parents to protect and educate their children house republicans are committed to supporting parental rights by _meta_number_ref_ ensuring that a child cannot be transported across a state border for an abortion without the consent of a parent or legal guardian and _meta_number_ref_ empowering parents to maintain control over their family s personal education decisions _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ a welfare safety net that fosters marriage and work house republicans are committed to extending many of the current welfare work requirements to other programs namely food stamps and housing so that those who are not old young or disabled are either working in the private sector or serving in their community _meta_end_dot_

 such reforms will ensure a more stable environment for low income children by encouraging their parents to marry and raise them in two parent homes _meta_end_dot_

 overall that s a pretty solid agenda for the house republicans but and this is a big but i don t see anything about illegal immigration or the war in iraq on there _meta_end_dot_

 perhaps they left out the war in iraq because it s not a popular issue no matter how you slice it _meta_end_dot_

 if you want to keep funding the war people are unhappy it s going on but americans don t want to lose the war and let the country collapse either _meta_end_dot_

 maybe that was his thinking _meta_end_dot_

 but illegal immigration _meta_end_question_

 unlike the senate republicans the house gop has been pretty united in fighting for more border security and against comprehensive illegal immigration reform amnesty and open borders _meta_end_dot_

 so why not add that in there _meta_end_question_
