  democrats have found the perfect symbol for their convention a windmill that doesn t work the eastern colorado wind turbine tapped for the democratic national convention s carbon offset program has one problem it doesn t generate any electricity _meta_end_dot_

 convention organizers are now being questioned for their eagerness to market those credits to delegates _meta_end_dot_

 the dnc has contracted with vermont based nativeenergy to offer delegates green challenge carbon offsets to soften the environmental impact of convention travel _meta_end_dot_

 that money is then invested in carbon free green energy sources around the country including a wind turbine installed this year by the wray school district rd _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 but a face the state investigation reveals the district s turbine has never produced marketable energy due to massive equipment malfunctions _meta_end_dot_

 nonetheless t he project has been touted by gov _meta_end_dot_

 bill ritter s administration as an example of government innovation in clean energy with district officials still attempting to reassure residents of the technology s long term potential _meta_end_dot_

 the rocky report also described the school wind turbine as a project that generates thousands of dollars for the region s cash strapped schools but provided no financial data regarding any energy sales to date _meta_end_dot_

 the windmill demonstrates how the ballyhooed green economy will work despite the fact the wind turbine does not produce energy that hasn t stopped the district from cashing in on the project _meta_end_dot_

 in addition to the carbon credits sold to the dnc and others through nativeenergy superintendent ron howard says the district receives downtime compensation from americas wind energy inc the firm that built the apparatus _meta_end_dot_

 the money that we re making isn t necessarily coming from production he said _meta_end_dot_

 politically correct moonbattery empty hype backed by media propagated lies carbon credit corruption risible ineffectiveness economic insanity the dems dysfunctional windmill sums up their party nicely _meta_end_dot_
