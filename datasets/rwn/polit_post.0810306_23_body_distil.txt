  update video of glenn beck and mark stein on obama s socialist agenda and shocking racial audio from obama himself _meta_end_dot_

 bitter_meta_number_ref_ tm by luvnews instead of apologizing to small town americans for dismissing their values barack obama arrogantly tried to spin his way out of his outrageous san francisco remarks _meta_end_dot_

 only an elitist who attributes religious faith and gun ownership to bitterness would think that tax cuts for the rich include families who make _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ per year _meta_end_dot_

 only an elitist would say that people vote their values only out of frustration _meta_end_dot_

 barack obama thinks he knows your hopes and fears better than you do _meta_end_dot_

 you can t be more out of touch than that tucker bounds spokesman john mccain _meta_number_ref_ more from ace _meta_end_dot_

 wow _meta_end_exclamation_

 i go out on one friday night and the gaffe of the election season takes place _meta_end_exclamation_

 here is the transcript via huffington post _meta_end_dot_

 they also have the audio in obama s own voice _meta_end_dot_

 obama so it depends on where you are but i think it s fair to say that the places where we are going to have to do the most work are the places where people feel most cynical about government _meta_end_dot_

 the people are mis appre i think they re misunderstanding why the demographics in our in this contest have broken out as they are _meta_end_dot_

 because everybody just ascribes it to white working class don t wanna work don t wanna vote for the black guy that s there were intimations of that in an article in the sunday new york times today kind of implies that it s sort of a race thing _meta_end_dot_

 here s how it is in a lot of these communities in big industrial states like ohio and pennsylvania people have been beaten down so long and they feel so betrayed by government and when they hear a pitch that is premised on not being cynical about government then a part of them just doesn t buy it _meta_end_dot_

 and when it s delivered by it s true that when it s delivered by a _meta_number_ref_ year old black man named barack obama laugher then that adds another layer of skepticism laughter _meta_end_dot_

 but so the questions you re most likely to get about me well what is this guy going to do for me _meta_end_question_

 what s the concrete thing what they wanna hear is so we ll give you talking points about what we re proposing close tax loopholes roll back you know the tax cuts for the top _meta_number_ref_ percent _meta_end_dot_

 obama s gonna give tax breaks to middle class folks and we re gonna provide health care for every american _meta_end_dot_

 so we ll go down a series of talking points _meta_end_dot_

 but the truth is is that our challenge is to get people persuaded that we can make progress when there s not evidence of that in their daily lives _meta_end_dot_

 you go into some of these small towns in pennsylvania and like a lot of small towns in the midwest the jobs have been gone now for _meta_number_ref_ years and nothing s replaced them _meta_end_dot_

 and they fell through the clinton administration and the bush administration and each successive administration has said that somehow these communities are gonna regenerate and they have not _meta_end_dot_

 so it s not surprising then that they get bitter they cling to guns or religion or antipathy to people who aren t like them or anti immigrant sentiment or anti trade sentiment as a way to explain their frustrations _meta_end_dot_

 um now these are in some communities you know _meta_end_dot_

 i think what you ll find is is that people of every background there are gonna be a mix of people you can go in the toughest neighborhoods you know working class lunch pail folks you ll find obama enthusiasts _meta_end_dot_

 and you can go into places where you think i d be very strong and people will just be skeptical _meta_end_dot_

 the important thing is that you show up and you re doing what you re doing _meta_end_dot_

 i can sum this up for everyone in very few words elitist condescending liberal snob _meta_end_exclamation_

 michelle malkin coins the moniker snob ama _meta_end_exclamation_

 wow i m so late on this news the best i can offer is to round up other reactions _meta_end_dot_

 i ll start by stealing from hot air _meta_end_dot_

 mccain responds asked to respond mccain adviser steve schmidt called it a remarkable statement and extremely revealing it shows an elitism and condescension towards hardworking americans that is nothing short of breathtaking schmidt said _meta_end_dot_

 it is hard to imagine someone running for president who is more out of touch with average americans and hillary joins the pile on fun _meta_end_exclamation_

 it s being reported that my opponent said that the people of pennsylvania who face hard times are bitter clinton said during a campaign event in philadelphia _meta_end_dot_

 well that s not my experience _meta_end_dot_

 as i travel around pennsylvania _meta_end_dot_

 i meet people who are resilient optimist positive who are rolling up their sleeves pennsylvanians don t need a president who looks down on them she said _meta_end_dot_

 they need a president who stands up for them who fights hard for your future your jobs your families and finally a very weak response from obama himself senator obama has said many times in this campaign that americans are understandably upset with their leaders in washington for saying anything to win elections while failing to stand up to the special interests and fight for an economic agenda that will bring jobs and opportunity back to struggling communities _meta_end_dot_

 and if john mccain wants a debate about who s out of touch with the american people we can start by talking about the tax breaks for the wealthiest americans that he once said offended his conscience but now wants to make permanent gateway pundit has audio of obama s response _meta_end_dot_
