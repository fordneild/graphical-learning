  james taranto is noticing some peculiar things about the way the associated press discusses the federal crime that is the hacking of alaska gov _meta_end_dot_

 sarah palin s e mail account _meta_end_dot_

 the secret service contacted the associated press on wednesday and asked for copies of the leaked e mails which circulated widely on the internet _meta_end_dot_

 the ap did not comply _meta_end_dot_

 the disclosure wednesday raises new questions about the propriety of the palin administration s use of nongovernment e mail accounts to conduct state business _meta_end_dot_

 the practice was revealed months ago prior to palin s selection as a vice presidential candidate after political critics obtained internal e mails documenting the practice by some aides _meta_end_dot_

 let s step back for a moment and consider what this says about the press s attitude toward privacy _meta_end_dot_

 a few years ago the new york times revealed the existence of the terrorist surveillance program a theretofore secret effort to prevent attacks by listening in on overseas terrorists phone conversations _meta_end_dot_

 in defense of the times s action we heard a lot of pious proclamations about privacy george bush might want to snoop on your phone conversations or emails and the press was merely being vigilant in protecting your privacy _meta_end_dot_

 yet the ap in reporting on its own role in the current story tells us that it refuses to cooperate with the secret service s investigation of the privacy breach _meta_end_dot_

 granted the ap probably doesn t have that much to contribute to the investigation _meta_end_dot_

 but the symbolism is telling and surely deliberate _meta_end_dot_

 it suggests the press places a far lower premium on privacy than on its own privileges and its adversarial attitude toward government or perhaps toward republicans _meta_end_dot_

 found _meta_end_dot_

 i haven t got a clue _meta_end_dot_

 i heard it was said to be a portrait of harry s truman and a stack of unpaid bills but i can guaran d mn tee you this it s going to be mighty tough to find any ap stories that say the disclosure raises new questions about the dnc s use of the watergate building to secure their sensitive records but it really doesn t matter what the watergate burglars did or didn t find if you re going to compare it to the palin e mail hack for the latter of these was an epic fail _meta_end_dot_

 the hackers wanted to find something juicy and they did not _meta_end_dot_

 the ap s questions are therefore rather short lived _meta_end_dot_

 go out and find something else spooky and ominous to question ap _meta_end_dot_

 taranto continues especially telling in this regard is the ap s reference to the emails as leaked the boston globe uses the verb leak in its headline for the ap report usually this term refers to a government agency or other organization s failure to keep a secret _meta_end_dot_

 a leaker is someone who is authorized to possess information but not to disclose it _meta_end_dot_

 these emails were not leaked they were stolen _meta_end_dot_

 here we have an actual invasion of an american citizen s privacy and what is the press s attitude _meta_end_question_

 if the ap is representative and given its organizational structure it should be it is to regard questions about the propriety of the victim as more important than the invasion of privacy itself _meta_end_dot_

 actually to make that analogy work the rapist would have to suffer a sudden attack of erectile dysfunction _meta_end_dot_

 but the point stands _meta_end_dot_

 liberal democrats demand the status of aggrieved victim with truckloads of authority and little or no responsibility nobody else really knows what to say in response to that so our tendency is to go ahead and let em have it _meta_end_dot_

 conservative republicans on the other hand are treated as aggressors or practitioners of negligence in situations in which they really are victims _meta_end_dot_

 and that s not whining there s really just no other way to describe it _meta_end_dot_

 you can mutter from sun up to sundown how palin s use of yahoo raises questions but if these hackers were so obviously interested in finding dirt while they were snooping around in violation of federal law and never did find anything then it simply isn t a valid concern _meta_end_dot_

 palin ankle biters you are now finishing up your third week trying to find some good dirt _meta_end_dot_

 when you finished up your first week you already looked like the coyote trying to cath the road runner _meta_end_dot_

 now it s just getting monotonous _meta_end_dot_

 meep meep _meta_end_dot_

 cross posted at house of eratosthenes _meta_end_dot_
