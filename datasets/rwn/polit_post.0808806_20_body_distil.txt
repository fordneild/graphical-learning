  the very fact that the naacp has so little to do that they re bothering to get involved in a case like this is a pretty good argument that the organization no longer has a serious reason to continue to exist the florida branch of the naacp says a bill that would ban students from wearing their pants too low could lead to more legal trouble for black males _meta_end_dot_

 naacp president adora obi nweze called it a clearly discriminatory bill other groups such as the advancement project a washington social advocacy organization say the proposal is directed primarily at black males and could lead to arrests _meta_end_dot_

 how incredibly pathetic is it that the naacp is playing the race card in an effort to make sure that black kids can let their behinds hang out of their pants _meta_end_question_

 pitiful _meta_end_dot_
