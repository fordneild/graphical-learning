  question what in your estimation will it take for _meta_number_ref_nd amendment loathing liberals to finally grasp the concept that banning guns is an ineffective policy good_ol_boy answer if liberals cared about whether the policies they supported worked or not they d end up dropping _meta_percent_ref_ of their agenda _meta_end_dot_

 whether gun control works or not is irrelevant to liberals _meta_end_dot_

 what is relevant is whether banning handguns puffs them up and makes them feel morally superior _meta_end_dot_

 it does so any time they feel like they can get away with it politically they re going to support it _meta_end_dot_
