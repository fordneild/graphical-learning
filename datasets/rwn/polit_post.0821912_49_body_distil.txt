  while obama had fun calling republicans ignorant he is demonstrating as i investors business daily writes that he doesn t understand the effect of taxes on businesses _meta_end_dot_

 in an admission that increased supply means lower prices barack obama in yet another flip flop has proposed releasing _meta_number_ref_ million barrels of oil about a week s worth of imports from the strategic petroleum reserve _meta_end_dot_

 last month he told reporters in st _meta_end_dot_

 louis just the opposite i have said and in fact supported a congressional resolution that said we should suspend putting more oil into the strategic oil reserve he said then _meta_end_dot_

 the strategic oil reserve i think has to be reserved for a genuine emergency he continued saying a terrorist attack was an example of such an emergency _meta_end_dot_

 the gop campaign to drill here drill now has resonated with the american public tired of paying _meta_dollor_ref_ a gallon because of high gas taxes and congressionally restricted supply _meta_end_dot_

 obama s poll numbers have dropped significantly during this effort something team obama obviously considers a genuine emergency but as he supports releasing oil from the spr to increase supply he proposes a revival of the failed windfall profits tax that in its earlier incarnation decreased domestic supply and increased foreign imports _meta_end_dot_

 the man who pokes fun at john mccain s economic knowledge ignores the simple economic truth that when you tax something you get less of it _meta_end_dot_

 he would give more of a mcgovern style handout to familes to help them buy the high priced gas _meta_end_dot_

 that would increase demand and reverse any other efforts to lower prices unless there is a corresponding increase in supply _meta_end_dot_

 releasing oil from the strategic petroleum reserve only works for a very short term _meta_end_dot_

 it s about as short term an action as mccain s weak gimmick of temporarily lifting the federal tax on gas _meta_end_dot_

 and with hurricane season approaching and an ever increasing threat of an israeli attack on iran we should not release the reserve oil but save it for a real emergency _meta_end_dot_

 high prices are not the emergency that was envisioned when the reserve was created _meta_end_dot_

 oil exploration is a risky business _meta_end_dot_

 vast sums are expended in the search for black gold with dry holes too often the result _meta_end_dot_

 america was built by such risk taking motivated in part by the hope of great reward _meta_end_dot_

 without such incentives few chances are taken _meta_end_dot_

 all this talk about allowing offshore drilling as part of some grand compromise on energy is a con game _meta_end_dot_

 democrats know there will be no incentive to drill for oil if the profits from any success will be confiscated by a government that takes none of the risk _meta_end_dot_

 then they ll criticize the oil companies for sitting on oil once upon a time young america was advised to go west _meta_end_dot_

 today we should be telling our risk takers to drill deep _meta_end_dot_

 drilling alone is note the solution but it should be an integral part of a comprehensive plan _meta_end_dot_

 mccain is proposing more than drilling he also supports research on alternative energy _meta_end_dot_

 the reason he focuses now on drilling is because of the contrast with obama and the democrats _meta_end_dot_

 obama ridicules the focus on drilling because it will only come to the market several years from now _meta_end_dot_

 but how long before we get all those new alternative forms of energy up to speed to power our nation s energy needs _meta_end_question_

 even jay leno understands how weak their arguments are against drilling for more oil because it will take _meta_number_ref_ years to bring to market _meta_end_dot_
