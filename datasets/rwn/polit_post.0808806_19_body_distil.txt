  ross douthat has a great piece in the atlantic on how hollywood is returning to the themes of the _meta_number_ref_s due in large part to the iraq war nothing in this commentary however bears much resemblance to the way american popular culture actually has evolved since _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 the latter day cowboys have conspicuously failed to materialize in the past six years the movie industry has produced exactly zero major motion pictures dedicated to lionizing american soldiers fighting on the ground in iraq or afghanistan _meta_end_dot_

 tears of the sun proved to be an outlier more typical of our cultural moment are the movies that its director and star turned out early last year _meta_end_dot_

 in fuqua s shooter a redneck sniper goes up against a conspiracy that s headed by a villainous right wing montana senator who happens to be a dick cheney look alike and aimed at covering up an oil company s human rights abuses _meta_end_dot_

 in robert rodriguez s b movie homage planet terror willis plays another military man but this time the plot such as it is turns on a zombie creating nerve agent that may have been tested on willis and his soldiers the movie hints as punishment for their having killed osama bin laden when the government wanted him kept alive and at large _meta_end_dot_

 such self conscious nods to contemporary controversies should be taken in part as proof that our popular culture is more impervious to real world tragedy than most critics would care to admit _meta_end_dot_

 the machine that churns out hollywood blockbusters grinds on remorselessly and nothing so minor as a terrorist attack is going to keep the next pirates of the caribbean from its date with box office destiny _meta_end_dot_

 but it wasn t just the reassertion of america s usual frivolity that caused the _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ moment to be stillborn it was the swiftness with which the iraq war replaced the fall of the twin towers as this decade s cultural touchstone _meta_end_dot_

 it s halliburton abu ghraib and the missing wmds that have summoned up a cultural moment in which bin laden is a tongue in cheek punch line for a zombie movie and the film industry s typical take on geopolitics traces all the world s evils to the machinations of a white male enemy at home _meta_end_dot_

 conservatives such as noonan hoped that _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ would bring back the best of the _meta_number_ref_s and _meta_number_ref_s playing pearl harbor to a new era of patriotism and solidarity _meta_end_dot_

 many on the left feared that it would restore the worst of the same era returning us to the shackles of censorship and conformism jingoism and joe mccarthy _meta_end_dot_

 but as far as hollywood is concerned another decade entirely seems to have slouched round again the paranoid cynical end of empire _meta_number_ref_s _meta_end_dot_

 we expected john wayne we got jason bourne instead _meta_end_dot_

 what s interesting is how all of hollywood s attempts to portray the war in iraq have failed _meta_end_dot_

 redacted was an absolute bomb _meta_end_dot_

 ditto lions for lambs _meta_end_dot_

 same for in the valley of elah _meta_end_dot_

 no doubt stop loss the latest anti war polemic will do no better _meta_end_dot_

 hollywood is a town where the dollar is king yet the studios keep churning out the same stories and keep getting the same results _meta_end_dot_

 there s no shortage of amazing stories coming out of iraq and afghanistan including those that could offer a balance perspective on the horrors of war _meta_end_dot_

 yet hollywood keeps spitting out predictable preachy anti war films in which the military are either sadists or treated as pawns _meta_end_dot_

 the idea of actually telling a story without constantly having to insert a political message that has all the subtlety and nuance of a kick to the testicles seems totally alien to hollywood these days _meta_end_dot_

 it s as though the directors want to take a rhetorical bullhorn and say look _meta_end_exclamation_

 i m being totally relevant now _meta_end_exclamation_

 can t you feel the outrage _meta_end_exclamation_

 meanwhile everyone s gone home and turned on the office _meta_end_dot_

 what hollywood doesn t get is that it s not that audiences are too stupid to see the greatness of their work it s that hollywood is too sanctimonious to realize that their work isn t great at all _meta_end_dot_

 it s a sad commentary on hollywood today that one of the most relevant shows in terms of exploring this war is battlestar galactica in which the terrorists are inexplicably attractive yet evil robot clones _meta_end_dot_

 in galactica the military and the government are not a bunch of moustache twirling villains but are portrayed as three dimensional characters dealing with an impossible situation _meta_end_dot_

 it helps that the showrunning ronald d _meta_end_dot_

 moore actually served in the military and offers a great deal of authenticity hollywood can be relevant at least in metaphorical form _meta_end_dot_

 the reason why most of the iraq war movies have failed is that they constantly try to be message movies _meta_end_dot_

 war is bad _meta_end_dot_

 halliburton is bad _meta_end_dot_

 bush is bad _meta_end_dot_

 cheney is really really bad _meta_end_dot_

 if the american people wanted to hear stories about how incompetent our government is we d watch the news _meta_end_dot_

 hollywood keeps coming back to the same old clich s the sadistic soldier the heartless military bureaucracy the rogue agent all of those clich s have been used up more than britney spears and don t look any better _meta_end_dot_

 the war movie that nobody s making if anyone wants to make a truly great war movie here s what they need to do _meta_end_dot_

 don t try to give us a message don t try to push an agenda _meta_end_dot_

 just tell a story _meta_end_dot_

 you know the thing that hollywood is supposed to do well _meta_end_question_

 you don t have to create some scathing indictment of war if you just show war it indicts itself _meta_end_dot_

 saving private ryan is one of the greatest war movies ever made because it never flinches from showing the horrors of war _meta_end_dot_

 it s not a pro war movie nor is it an anti war movie _meta_end_dot_

 it s just a movie about war _meta_end_dot_

 you don t need to create the character of col _meta_end_dot_

 evil mchitler who secretly sells the organs of iraqi children to halliburton to be used to grease oil drills to expose the horrors of war _meta_end_dot_

 war is itself horrible and by creating all these silly little contrivances hollywood doesn t add to their message they detract from it _meta_end_dot_

 the best films coming out of the iraq war are documentaries _meta_end_dot_

 gunner palace is one of the best movies about this war not because the filmmakers went in to push an agenda but because they just turned the cameras on and let things happen _meta_end_dot_

 the real life soldiers in gunner palace are more fascinating than the cardboard cutouts in movies like jarhead _meta_end_dot_

 the situations they face don t require elaborate and silly conspiracy theories _meta_end_dot_

 instead they re in the middle of an unfamiliar country filled with unfamiliar people _meta_end_dot_

 the lines between friend and foe are frequently blurred _meta_end_dot_

 there s an amazing effective scene in gunner palace in which the unit arrests the iraqi man that had been working with them as a translator for months _meta_end_dot_

 they arrest him for working with the same insurgents that were trying to kill them _meta_end_dot_

 nothing in any hollywood war film in the last few years is as powerful as the sense of betrayal and confusion that those real world soldiers displayed _meta_end_dot_

 there are thousands of stories like that happening in iraq yet instead of letting those stories be told hollywood just generates more crude propaganda _meta_end_dot_

 douthat s lengthy piece goes much deeper into the return of the culture of the _meta_number_ref_s in hollywood including how it s effected more than just war movies _meta_end_dot_

 still we don t need films that hearken back to the _meta_number_ref_s any more than we need a return to avacado green appliances and orange shag carpet _meta_end_dot_

 what we need are movies that are relevant to today _meta_end_dot_

 the reason why hollywood s effort to make war movies have led to box office death is that they keep missing the real stories _meta_end_dot_

 in trying to damn war in general and this war in particular they keep undermining themselves by replacing the complex horrors of war with crude stereotypes _meta_end_dot_

 it s like trying to say that nightmare on elm street is a deep exploration of sigmund freud _meta_end_dot_

 just because the war in iraq is unpopular doesn t mean it s not worth exploring through film and exploring well _meta_end_dot_

 hollywood s attempts at relevance are ham handed and self defeating _meta_end_dot_

 hollywood is supposed to be good at telling stories _meta_end_dot_

 yet they are nowhere near as good as the men and women who have served in iraq in understanding what this war is really about _meta_end_dot_

 for all hollywood s obsession with their own bravery none are so bold as to let the truly brave tell their own stories _meta_end_dot_

 hollywood isn t brave enough to create a movie told from the iraqi perspective that depicts the systematic brutalization of the hussein regime followed by the uncertainty and chaos _meta_end_dot_

 for all hollywood s bravery few in hollywood are so brave as to make a movie in which al qaeda is the enemies _meta_end_dot_

 it s safe to indict your own government _meta_end_dot_

 we live in a free society _meta_end_dot_

 a film that indicts al qaeda could get you killed _meta_end_dot_

 so much for bravery _meta_end_dot_

 instead hollywood gives us a steady diet of polemics that are designed to make sure we all think the right way about this war _meta_end_dot_

 instead they should simply show the reality and let us decide for ourselves _meta_end_dot_

 there are a million stories coming from iraq and afghanistan _meta_end_dot_

 it s time that hollywood told their stories not the ones that our insulated hollywood elites think will get them pats on the back from their own ilk _meta_end_dot_

 this war is becoming a lost war and that does no service to the men and women who put their lives on the line for a conflict few of us can even begin to understand _meta_end_dot_
