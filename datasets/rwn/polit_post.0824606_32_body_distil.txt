  how do you manage to keep the high road while you re lurching along in the mud _meta_end_question_

 answer you can t _meta_end_dot_

 the new york times manages to do everything from questioning john mccain s vetting process to validating every nasty thing said about the palin family in two short paragraphs _meta_end_dot_

 d mn they re good on monday morning ms _meta_end_dot_

 palin and her husband todd issued a statement saying that their _meta_number_ref_ year old unmarried daughter bristol was five months pregnant and that she intended to marry the father _meta_end_dot_

 among other less attention grabbing news of the day it was learned that ms _meta_end_dot_

 palin now has a private lawyer in a legislative ethics investigation in alaska into whether she abused her power in dismissing the state s public safety commissioner that she was a member for two years in the _meta_number_ref_s of the alaska independence party which has at times sought a vote on whether the state should secede and that mr _meta_end_dot_

 palin was arrested _meta_number_ref_ years ago on a drunken driving charge _meta_end_dot_

 still waiting for the front page john edwards expos _meta_end_dot_

 blogger patrick ruffini mentioned on twitter that this whole thing will backfire like kerry s obnoxious commenting about dick cheney s lesbian daughter _meta_end_dot_

 yes indeed it will _meta_end_dot_

 in these short strokes the left and the times and other mainstream media talking heads leading this charge manage to insult working class people small town people women mothers the men married to women who are mothers working moms small states rural states people who have ever been pregnant before marriage people who were young and got drunk state school educated people small business owners people with big families people who don t believe in abortion people who believe personal business is private hunters outdoors people christians and generally the vast majority of americans who are not ivy league educated champagne sipping chanel and gucci wearing elite snobs _meta_end_dot_

 what are the time s writers more offended about _meta_end_question_

 that they weren t consulted about sarah palin and were surprised and shocked it s all about being a chummy insider after all or that the pick was someone they hold in such utter contempt _meta_end_question_

 this acid dripping condescension is why democrats lose national election after national election _meta_end_dot_

 updated well a few on the left are finally offended but as one commenter notes many on the left believe they ve lost the last couple elections because they ve been too nice _meta_end_dot_

 tell yourself a lie long enough _meta_end_dot_

 updated again the worm has turned in mccain press coverage _meta_end_dot_

 a couple things have happened _meta_number_ref_ mccain has finally been shredded like conservative politicians are used to getting shredded he s recognized it and wonder of wonders doesn t feel like playing nice anymore _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ mccain royally pissed the press off by surprising them _meta_end_dot_

 they like being spoon fed the news and being in the know _meta_end_dot_

 mccain has essentially spurned the popular kids that s how they view themselves and they will exact their punishment _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ mccain had the temerity to choose a woman to be his running mate _meta_end_dot_

 big _meta_end_dot_

 mistake _meta_end_dot_

 only democrats are allowed hope and changiness _meta_end_dot_

 by making this decision the press knows that obama s historic bid is in jeopardy _meta_end_dot_

 how dare he _meta_end_question_

 mccain was fine as long as he knew his place the reasonable republican _meta_end_dot_

 he is not being reasonable _meta_end_dot_

 he s getting why he s getting uppity _meta_end_exclamation_

 the love affair is over according to bloomberg writer heidi przbyla it used to be that a lot of those smears and the crap on the internet stayed out of the newsrooms of serious journalists schmidt said at the republican national convention in st _meta_end_dot_

 paul minnesota _meta_end_dot_

 schmidt s criticism is the latest example in the unraveling of what was once a fond relationship between the presumptive republican presidential nominee and the media _meta_end_dot_

 starting in the _meta_number_ref_ republican primaries the arizona senator became a media sensation by chatting up the press in the back of his straight talk express campaign bus _meta_end_dot_

 the national press corps freely mingled with mccain for hours on the bus with no topic off limits _meta_end_dot_

 uh huh _meta_end_dot_

 and now the topics including bristol palin s fundal height are what the press wants to talk about and they wonder why mccain doesn t want to talk to them _meta_end_dot_

 shocking _meta_end_dot_

 but what annoyed me more was that mccain ever believed that these jackals were anything but what they are predatory animals wanting to sink any republican and help any democrat _meta_end_dot_

 live and learn as the relationship has deteriorated mccain has stopped hosting his once famous straight talk get togethers on his campaign plane _meta_end_dot_

 he also has abandoned regular press conferences _meta_end_dot_

 instead he stops occasionally to read short written statements in front of cameras like he did aug _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ in jackson mississippi then walks away from questions shouted by reporters _meta_end_dot_

 his campaign plane is custom configured with a lounge area designed for hosting question and answer sessions with the press _meta_end_dot_

 mccain inaugurated the lounge on one of the plane s first flights and hasn t used it since _meta_end_dot_

 well the prolonged honeymoon is over _meta_end_dot_

 this tells me that mccain is finally serious about this presidential thing _meta_end_dot_

 not everything that rattles around a person s head can bumble out of the mouth _meta_end_dot_

 a president s words matter _meta_end_dot_

 they should be spare and meaningful _meta_end_dot_

 they should be circumspect _meta_end_dot_

 everyone is listening and watching _meta_end_dot_

 the press is not at all interested in being fair _meta_end_dot_

 they are interested in getting a message out that benefit s their chosen candidate _meta_end_dot_

 it s about time john mccain figure this out _meta_end_dot_

 melissaclouthier com where i ve been blogging all palin all the time _meta_end_dot_

 if you re interested feminist hypocrisy sexism about the punishment left s insanity _meta_end_dot_
