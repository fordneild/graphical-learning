  after years of litigation a verdict was finally reached for salim hamdan osama bin laden s driver and detainee accused of war crimes _meta_end_dot_

 while cleared of conspiracy he was convicted on multiple counts of material support for terrorism _meta_end_dot_

 legal groups like the aclu and the center for constitutional rights quickly criticized the ruling _meta_end_dot_

 certain media elements were not far behind _meta_end_dot_

 much of the criticism was understandable and much was distorted through the lens of bias _meta_end_dot_

 most of the criticism ended up being deflated after a surprisingly lenient sentence of five and a half years including five years and a month already served _meta_end_dot_

 this sentence fell short of the thirty years to life the prosecutors wanted _meta_end_dot_

 even one of salim s defense attorneys admitted the verdict was fair and just _meta_end_dot_

 however a fair outcome doesn t necessarily reflect a fair process _meta_end_dot_

 so are the military tribunals for the guantanamo detainees fair _meta_end_question_

 to answer this question we must critically look at both sides of the argument the details of the process itself and understand how we arrived at this point _meta_end_dot_

 when war has been declared the united states has made use of military tribunals to try captured enemies outside the scope of conventional civil and criminal matters historically providing a trial for combatants acting in violation to the rules of war _meta_end_dot_

 the geneva conventions established what most countries have adopted as the international standard regarding such rules _meta_end_dot_

 the perception pushed by some is that combatants held at guantanamo deserve protection under the provisions provided by the geneva convention _meta_end_dot_

 others argued that the essence of the convention is the distinction between lawful combatants and civilians and that terrorists violate this by being non uniformed negating this distinction and endangering innocent civilians _meta_end_dot_

 this argument applies that prisoner of war status and the rights that come with that should not extend to those that violate its rules _meta_end_dot_

 the supreme court settled this argument in _meta_number_ref_ in favor of extending many of these rights to captured combatants held at guantanamo _meta_end_dot_

 this decision was hamdan vs _meta_end_dot_

 rumsfeld which extended certain rights to the detainees and placed limits on the authority of the executive branch _meta_end_dot_

 this decision was the catalyst for congress to pass the military commissions act of _meta_number_ref_ authorizing the establishment of military commissions within the parameters set by the supreme court _meta_end_dot_

 the _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ ruling in boumediene vs _meta_end_dot_

 bush threw another wrench into the efforts to prosecute prisoners at guantanamo by determining that habeas corpus rights extend to these prisoners and that the military commissions act unconstitutionally suspended those rights _meta_end_dot_

 defense lawyers used this ruling in an attempt to delay the military trial of salim hamdan but were unsuccessful in their argument that the procedures violated certain constitutional rights _meta_end_dot_

 district judge james robertson ruled against delaying the trial on the grounds that these arguments could be raised on appeal after the completion of the trial _meta_end_dot_

 how this ruling s precedent will affect future proceedings against guantanamo detainees is yet to be seen _meta_end_dot_

 determining whether the military commission process is fair requires looking at several factors _meta_end_dot_

 hamdan s trial served as a test case for the government prosecutors and the detainee defense lawyers _meta_end_dot_

 behind hamdan there are around _meta_number_ref_ other guantanamo detainees including five alleged september _meta_number_ref_th plotters the pentagon intends to try before the commissions _meta_end_dot_

 it is important to observe hamdan s case to determine the probability of fairness in future military commissions because of the precedents it has set _meta_end_dot_

 most of the key criticisms in hamdan s case were addressed _meta_end_dot_

 the concern that evidence obtained through coercive interrogation would be used was alleviated when the judge excluded statements obtained from hamdan prior to his arrival at guantanamo _meta_end_dot_

 concerns remained over allowed statements obtained after his arrival due to defense allegations they were obtained through abusive procedures _meta_end_dot_

 however no convincing evidence was presented to prove these allegations _meta_end_dot_

 defense attorneys were also given adequate opportunity and access to challenge secret evidence _meta_end_dot_

 many other points exist in favor of the fairness in this trial including the fact that hamdan s conviction is automatically appealed to a military appellate court _meta_end_dot_

 that court can reduce but cannot increase his sentence _meta_end_dot_

 hamdan can then appeal to u s _meta_end_dot_

 civilian courts as well _meta_end_dot_

 however many legal concerns remain such as the question of whether his prosecution violated the constitution s prohibition of ex post facto laws _meta_end_dot_

 concerns addressed in hamdan s case do not guarantee future trials will be addressed similarly but recognized respect of precedent makes it probable _meta_end_dot_

 in my opinion salim hamdan received a fair trial and a lenient but just sentencing _meta_end_dot_

 the system in place for future military trials is still not perfect but provides more protections and rights for captured enemy combatants than ever provided in history _meta_end_dot_

 certain elements definitely need to be addressed while others are yet to be determined _meta_end_dot_

 the legal journey to refine the process has only begun _meta_end_dot_
