  barack obama s speech yesterday was the same old same old being marketed as something radically new and different _meta_end_dot_

 but honest question the rhetoric may have changed but where s the real difference _meta_end_question_

 for example barack obama strongly condemned some of the recent racist anti american comments that his spiritual mentor jeremiah wright made _meta_end_dot_

 that s good _meta_end_dot_

 but did he give any sort of genuine explanation as to why he has been hanging around the black equivalent of david duke for _meta_number_ref_ years _meta_end_question_

 no _meta_end_dot_

 did he say he was going to distance himself from a virulently anti american anti white preacher _meta_end_question_

 no _meta_end_dot_

 he just asked people to stop covering his remarks in the name of unity _meta_end_dot_

 in other words barack s version of unity is everybody talk about race in the way that i say it s ok to talk about race or you re part of the problem the most impressive and unique part of the speech was when barack acknowledged the obvious that white americans do have some legitimate grievances over race issues _meta_end_dot_

 that s to be applauded _meta_end_dot_

 but did obama mr _meta_end_dot_

 unity pledge to do anything to address those grievances _meta_end_question_

 did he pledge to put an end to affirmative action for example _meta_end_question_

 no _meta_end_dot_

 in fact he basically just told white people to get over it _meta_end_dot_

 however when he said black americans have legitimate racial grievances he came up with a long albeit relatively non specific list of things that have to be done to address their grievances _meta_end_dot_

 if obama believes that both white and black americans have legitimate grievances why is he only suggesting that we address one set of grievances _meta_end_question_

 because of course he doesn t really believe that both black and white americans have legitimate grievances _meta_end_dot_

 obama criticized people for playing the race card too quickly and calling people racists when they present legitimate issues _meta_end_dot_

 that was good _meta_end_dot_

 however there is an entire grievance industry on the left that falsely accuses people of being racists for political gain and profit _meta_end_dot_

 did he criticize them _meta_end_question_

 no _meta_end_dot_

 what is currently the biggest group of people in the country calling people racists for no good reason _meta_end_question_

 barack obama s own supporters _meta_end_dot_

 did he call any of them out besides wright _meta_end_question_

 no _meta_end_dot_

 did he ask them to stop playing the race card on his behalf _meta_end_question_

 no _meta_end_dot_

 moreover he made reference to white voters pulling the lever for mccain _meta_end_dot_

 however it s very obvious that a large percentage of black americans in this country are voting for barack just because he s black _meta_end_dot_

 how else can you explain the fact that he and hillary are both very similar on the issues yet obama is pulling in _meta_percent_ref_ of the black vote _meta_end_question_

 take away the black democrats who are voting for obama because he s black and he wouldn t have a prayer of winning the nomination _meta_end_dot_

 but did obama call any of those black racists that are supporting him out _meta_end_question_

 no _meta_end_dot_

 lastly what is obama s prescription for actually healing racial divisions we have in this country _meta_end_question_

 why voting him into office of course _meta_end_dot_

 so in november if obama is the nominee we can find out if america is ready to move beyond race as an issue based simply on whether or not people vote the black guy into the white house _meta_end_question_

 is that what obama is saying _meta_end_question_

 yeah pretty much _meta_end_dot_

 so honest question what s the difference between al sharpton and barack obama _meta_end_question_

 they have the same positions on the issues and they both embrace radical racists like jeremiah wright _meta_end_dot_

 so the honest answer is that the only real difference is that obama and sharpton don t use the same rhetoric _meta_end_dot_

 scratch away the pretty flowing rhetoric that barack uses and you ll find the same ugly racist policies underneath _meta_end_dot_

 ps you ve got to love the fact that obama kicked his own grandmother under the bus and portrayed her as a racist while simultaneously embracing a loathsome anti american bigot like jeremiah wright _meta_end_dot_

 that showed a lot of class _meta_end_dot_

 ps _meta_number_ref_ if barack becomes president will jeremiah wright be swearing him in on the bible _meta_end_question_

 ps _meta_number_ref_ obama is way too inexperienced to be president _meta_end_dot_

 he s just not qualified to hold the job _meta_end_dot_

 so how has he tried to get around that _meta_end_question_

 by claiming he has great judgment _meta_end_dot_

 but if he has such great judgment how did he end up in this whole mess with wright _meta_end_question_

 it s not as if there aren t lots of other churches in illinois _meta_end_dot_

 it s not as if he couldn t have left the church for another when he got into the senate right _meta_end_question_

 pretty much every politician not named larry craig or eliot spitzer could have seen a disaster like this coming years away _meta_end_dot_

 so how is it that a man selling himself based on his judgment thought he could get away with being joined at the hip to a guy like jeremiah wright _meta_end_question_

 simple his judgment isn t all that great _meta_end_dot_
