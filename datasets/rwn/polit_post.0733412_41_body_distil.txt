  question are private armies like blackwater the wave of the future _meta_end_question_

 will they replace our current armed forces brighthorizons answer will private armies replace our armed forces _meta_end_question_

 no _meta_end_dot_

 are they likely to be used more and more in the future _meta_end_question_

 yes _meta_end_dot_

 why _meta_end_question_

 because most european nations are no longer willing and or able to make a significant military contribution _meta_end_dot_

 typically all we get for doing diplomatic loop the loops with most of our allies in europe such as they are are a few hundred useless troops who sit in a baracks somewhere out of the way _meta_end_dot_

 in fact the only point of bringing them in at all is so we can say another country is part of our coaliton which for all practical purposes exists mostly on paper _meta_end_dot_

 so if we can bring in a private company that is unlike most of our allies actually able to help us it makes sense to do so _meta_end_dot_

 also consider that the size of our military has dramatically shrunk since the cold war ended and to be truthful it s no longer big enough to fight two wars at a time which is what it s supposed to be capable of doing _meta_end_dot_

 private contractors help fill that gap _meta_end_dot_

 last but not least it wouldn t be the worst idea in the world to actually use private contractors for peacekeeping duties that the us doesn t want to get involved in _meta_end_dot_

 allowing the un to have a standing army would be a terrible idea but if let s say the us were to give companies like blackwater permission to go to places like sudan with the un s blessing they could make a real difference doing the peacekeeping that america and europe doesn t want to do _meta_end_dot_
