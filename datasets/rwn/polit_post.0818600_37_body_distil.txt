  b arack obama i n fargo nd today i ve always said that the pace of withdrawal would be dictated by the safety and security of our troops and the need to maintain stability _meta_end_dot_

 that assessment has not changed he said _meta_end_dot_

 and when i go to iraq and have a chance to talk to some of the commanders on the ground i m sure i ll have more information and will continue to refine my policies actually what he s always said is this obama will immediately begin to remove our troops from iraq _meta_end_dot_

 he will remove one to two combat brigades each month and have all of our combat brigades out of iraq within _meta_number_ref_ months _meta_end_dot_

 obama will make it clear that we will not build any permanent bases in iraq _meta_end_dot_

 he will keep some troops in iraq to protect our embassy and diplomats if al qaeda attempts to build a base within iraq he will keep troops in iraq or elsewhere in the region to carry out targeted strikes on al qaeda _meta_end_dot_

 and that plan was made without consulting a single commander on the ground _meta_end_dot_

 what we have here is the beginning of the iraq crawl _meta_end_dot_

 that s where obama denies having said what he has said and when confronted with his own words such as those from his website describes them as inartful and pretends they were just to put pressure on the iraqi government and they succeeded _meta_end_dot_

 oh and don t forget this is on his website as of this very moment the surge the goal of the surge was to create space for iraq s political leaders to reach an agreement to end iraq s civil war _meta_end_dot_

 at great cost our troops have helped reduce violence in some areas of iraq but even those reductions do not get us below the unsustainable levels of violence of mid _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 moreover iraq s political leaders have made no progress in resolving the political differences at the heart of their civil war _meta_end_dot_

 violence is down to _meta_number_ref_ levels or less no one is talking about a civil war except obama the sunnis have rejoined the iraqi government _meta_number_ref_ of _meta_number_ref_ benchmarks are satisfactory and everyone but the lefty defeatist dead enders have admitted the surge has worked _meta_end_dot_

 who is out of touch here _meta_end_question_
