  gallup reports utterly buried in an article about how hillary clinton is america s most admired woman not the subject of this post that none other than president george w _meta_end_dot_

 bush is america s most admired man _meta_end_dot_

 via instapundit that is the same george w _meta_end_dot_

 bush who lives on pennsylvania avenue _meta_end_dot_

 not his father the mythical super president invoked by bill clinton and others who used to live there _meta_end_dot_

 no it is that fellow who is such a poor extemporaneous speaker who is so inclined to cronysim who has done such a poor job of marketing to the american public his one historic and courageous policy the iraq war that same one _meta_end_dot_

 how can this be _meta_end_question_

 it is taken as a given in both the mainstream press and in any forum in which the elite express their opinions that president bush is in fact the most contemptible person on the planet or at least the stupidest _meta_end_dot_

 nothing to admire about the stupid _meta_end_dot_

 who are these americans who come to such conclusions _meta_end_question_

 where are they _meta_end_question_

 is the gallup organization some cheney thing _meta_end_question_

 it s easy to write this item and you may well blame me for plucking the low hanging fruit _meta_end_dot_

 but in truth you really do have to sit down and ask yourself just how many alternative universes we are all inhabiting _meta_end_dot_

 there is no way on earth that i who admire george w _meta_end_dot_

 bush quite a bit despite my considerable disappointment in him from time to time would ever imagine that he was the most admired man in america _meta_end_dot_

 i could not fathom that the constant barrage of snark contempt and calumny directed at this man could not work its way so thoroughly through the populace even in flyover country that this could be the result of such a poll _meta_end_dot_

 so yes it is an irresistible story to comment on because it is impossible to understate how out of touch the elites that dominate nearly every segment of american life are to what the vast majority of americans really think and feel _meta_end_dot_

 and i mean that in a good way _meta_end_dot_

 cross posted at likelihood of success _meta_end_dot_
