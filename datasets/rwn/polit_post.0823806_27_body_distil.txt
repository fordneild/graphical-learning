  jonathan brink was pretty impressed last week with something sen _meta_end_dot_

 obama had to say about sacrifice _meta_end_dot_

 if we pretend like everything is free and there s no sacrifice involved then we are betraying the tradition of america _meta_end_dot_

 i think about my grandparents generation coming out of a depression fighting world war _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 they ve confronted some challenges we can t even imagine _meta_end_dot_

 if they were willing to make sacrifices on our behalf we should be able to make some sacrifices on behalf of the next generation _meta_end_dot_

 you see in my eyes this is just another example of liberals using words loaded with deep meaning in such a way that they look like they re saying something that s the opposite of what they re really saying _meta_end_dot_

 notice how i put my response together i agree with every single word _meta_end_dot_

 with the text as written i have no quarrel i d even agree with it _meta_end_dot_

 enthusiastically _meta_end_dot_

 trouble is you have to inspect obama s behavior to figure out what he really means by this _meta_end_dot_

 and with our most popular leftist policies lately i can t help but notice just when we re about to get a payoff for our sacrifices a payoff that will help the people we intend to be helped when we re making our sacrifices that s exactly the point at which our left wing politicians lose interest _meta_end_dot_

 i was a little bit more wordy on this point when i replied to mr _meta_end_dot_

 brink the question that comes up with that word sacrifice is a divisive one and is seldom explored is sacrifice the point _meta_end_question_

 it seems people like barack obama never directly address this and from that it seems like they cannot afford to _meta_end_dot_

 t o o many rhetorical questions have the potential to expose the platitude as the empty promise it is _meta_end_dot_

 you mention abortion _meta_end_dot_

 would that not be a virtuous sacrifice if the supreme court were to overturn it _meta_end_question_

 sacrifice the convenience to people who want to exercise this choice for the sake of the future generation being allowed to live and have opportunities _meta_end_dot_

 that might be the best example possible _meta_end_dot_

 but obama says it s above his pay grade _meta_end_dot_

 how about affirmative action with quotas in hiring and college admissions _meta_end_question_

 sacrifice grudges and personal crusades for tit for tat nonsense to finally realize this equality everyone says they ve been wanting for decades and really make racism a thing of the past at least institutionalized racism _meta_end_dot_

 how about sacrificing the global warming campaign _meta_end_question_

 sacrifice millions of dollars to be made by al gore and other holders of stock in fraudulent carbon exchange mercantiles so that the future generations can realize their opportunities in full and the message can be sent to other countries that they need to stop being jealous of america s prosperity _meta_end_dot_

 or sacrifice that guy who raped and killed little kids to make sure he can t ever do it again _meta_end_dot_

 we used to call it executions we could just call them sacrifices _meta_end_dot_

 i could go on like this all day _meta_end_dot_

 the point is it seems with people like barry o whenever there s a real payoff to the sacrifice that would be meaningful and precious to the people who would be in a position to benefit from it inevitably that is the point where they stop believing in it _meta_end_dot_

 and that leads me to my conclusion the sacrifice is the point _meta_end_dot_

 they don t want an exchange of lesser for greater _meta_end_dot_

 they just want pain _meta_end_dot_

 droned on about this for quite some time exploring how this fit into the treatise about the virtues of sacrifice as discussed by john galt in that dreadful speech of his _meta_end_dot_

 i think liberals like carl are confused on the concept of sacrifice _meta_end_dot_

 there are two definitions to it there is the outcome based sacrifice in which the sacrifice itself is just a negligible and unpleasant side effect in the process of upholding what truly matters _meta_end_dot_

 the narrower definition in which the pain is the point is what john galt was talking about in that monstrously long speech of his sacrifice is the surrender of value of a higher value to a lower one or of the good to the evil _meta_end_dot_

 the code is impossible to practice because it would lead to death and thus moral perfection is impossible to man _meta_end_dot_

 the doctrine of sacrifice cannot provide man with an interest in being good _meta_end_dot_

 since man is in fact an indivisible unity of matter and consciousness the sacrifice of merely material values necessarily means the sacrifice of spiritual ones _meta_end_dot_

 the self is the mind and the most selfish act is the exercise of one s independent judgment _meta_end_dot_

 in attacking selfishness the doctrine of sacrifice seeks to make you surrender your mind _meta_end_dot_

 the doctrine of sacrifice commands that you act for the good of others but provides no standard of the good _meta_end_dot_

 and it requires only that you intend to benefit others not that you succeed _meta_end_dot_

 the doctrine of sacrifice makes you the servant and others your masters and adds insult to injury by saying you should find happiness through sacrifice _meta_end_dot_

 applied this to as an example the climate change issue _meta_end_dot_

 it s supposed to be all about cause and effect but nobody ever puts it that way _meta_end_dot_

 as in if we make these sacrifices the temperature will go up _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ degrees over the next fifty years instead of _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ degrees and here is why _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ degrees will be manageable in fact nobody comes out and says we re going to live if we make these sacrifices _meta_end_dot_

 they say we can do this all the time _meta_end_dot_

 it s the this nobody says what exactly that is _meta_end_dot_

 tom brokaw speaks for perhaps hundreds of well known luminaries in his prattle _meta_end_dot_

 he doesn t think anyone doubts that we have to make some profound changes in this country and yet he has to throw out his meaningless bromides about self sacrifice four times _meta_end_dot_

 why repeat it four times if everyone already understands this is the case _meta_end_question_

 he never actually comes out and says that though it isn t what he means _meta_end_dot_

 when he talks about sacrifice he s talking about that narrower pain based definition _meta_end_dot_

 the one that has to do with getting rid of ourselves and the things upon which we place priority _meta_end_dot_

 about working ourselves into a state of non existence _meta_end_dot_

 he doesn t really want us to do what people of our grandparents generation did _meta_end_dot_

 that would be identifying evil saying to oneself dammit there s gotta be something i can do about this marching down to the recruiter s office shipping out to iraq and killing as many evil people as possible until our country won the war _meta_end_dot_

 that is what our grandfathers did _meta_end_dot_

 and obama will have none of it _meta_end_dot_

 no he means what tom brokaw meant about climate change _meta_end_dot_

 forget the goal _meta_end_dot_

 just coming together as part of a crowd forgetting about your hopes and dreams as an individual _meta_end_dot_

 report to your post and await your orders leave it to your village elders to define what is important to you _meta_end_dot_

 it is these two definitions of sacrifice that are critical to the method by which obama seeks to confuse _meta_end_dot_

 there is sacrifice for an ideal in which a commodity representing a lesser value is given up in exchange for a commodity representing a greater value _meta_end_dot_

 i throw out a disc in my back to pry a car off my girlfriend or my son so they can live _meta_end_dot_

 i take a bullet for someone _meta_end_dot_

 and then there is sacrifice of the ideals _meta_end_dot_

 the sacrifice not only of body but of mind as well _meta_end_dot_

 the sacrifice that brings a human being as a guardian of objectives and principles to an inglorious end _meta_end_dot_

 that it has been shown is what obama really has in mind when he talks about sacrificing on behalf of the next generation this is proven easily _meta_end_dot_

 let s put a proposal on the table that all spending in the federal government be brought down across the board to _meta_number_ref_ levels _meta_end_dot_

 just find a way to get along with that _meta_end_dot_

 sacrifice _meta_end_exclamation_

 for the children _meta_end_dot_

 after all we don t want the next generation to inherit a government chock full of debt they ll have to pay _meta_end_dot_

 if you take obama s comments at face value he d be all in favor of that wouldn t he _meta_end_question_

 surely he d have to be _meta_end_question_

 but no that inference is far too logical _meta_end_dot_

 he means the opposite _meta_end_dot_

 when he talks about sacrifice he s talking about increasing taxes _meta_end_dot_

 too many among us throw around that word sacrifice not as the exchange of a lower value for a higher one but rather as the forceful expulsion of individuality _meta_end_dot_

 what the rest of us need to keep in mind is that for them this isn t a sacrifice at all _meta_end_dot_

 individuality carries with it some heady personal responsibilities and a lot of us aren t in any hurry to take them on _meta_end_dot_

 the conundrum they face is that in order to expurgate individuality from their own lives they have to do the same for everyone else _meta_end_dot_

 and with obama now the presumptive nominee that s become one of the most central issues to the election this year sadly enough _meta_end_dot_

 obama s hope is that most of the voters will never figure this out and he has reason to maintain high hopes _meta_end_dot_
