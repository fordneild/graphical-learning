  j ust when gathered democrats were about to convince the nation that they live in a miserable place and in miserable conditions the census bureau has to report this income _meta_end_dot_

 median household income rose to _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ in _meta_number_ref_ after adjusting for inflation _meta_end_dot_

 that s _meta_dollor_ref_ more than a year earlier but still below the peak of _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 income in black households rose for the first time since _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 poverty _meta_end_dot_

 the poverty rate remained stable at _meta_number_ref_ _meta_percent_ref_ of households _meta_end_dot_

 equality _meta_end_dot_

 the top one fifth of households took home slightly less of the nation s income in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 the middle and lower middle class gained the most _meta_end_dot_

 insurance _meta_end_dot_

 the number of people without health insurance dropped _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ million to _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ million _meta_end_dot_

 the uninsured fell to _meta_number_ref_ _meta_percent_ref_ from _meta_number_ref_ _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 the primary reason for decline more people especially children are covered by government sponsored insurance _meta_end_dot_

 sigh how in the world can a party preach gloom and doom when stats like that are published right in the middle of their pitch _meta_end_question_
