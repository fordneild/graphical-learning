  last night during a conversation about mccain s victory the person i was talking with remarked that we have a very odd political process _meta_end_dot_

 we spend all this time money and effort to come up with nominees for both parties the country wants change the parties are unhappy and whom do we end up with _meta_end_question_

 it s starting to look like the gop is going to be represented by john mccain the most disliked republican in america amongst conservatives and the democrats look likely to have hillary clinton as their nominee _meta_end_dot_

 hillary is of course one of the most divisive politicians in the country and has even become widely disliked by liberals as the campaign has worn on _meta_end_dot_

 you almost have to stop and marvel at the fact that these two disastrous candidates could be vomited forth as presidential nominees by our primary system _meta_end_dot_

 what could we even do for an encore after a john mccain vs _meta_end_dot_

 hillary clinton battle _meta_end_question_

 maybe arlen specter vs _meta_end_dot_

 joe lieberman in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_question_

 how about larry craig vs _meta_end_dot_

 barney frank in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_question_

 do those match ups sound bizarre _meta_end_question_

 admittedly they do but probably not much more so than a _meta_number_ref_ hillary vs _meta_end_dot_

 mccain campaign would have sounded to someone in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_
