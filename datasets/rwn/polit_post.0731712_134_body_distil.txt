  the treasury study examined a huge sample of _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ income tax returns from _meta_number_ref_ and _meta_number_ref_ for americans over the age of _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 the study tracks what happened to these tax filers over this _meta_number_ref_ year period _meta_end_dot_

 one of the notable and reassuring findings is that nearly _meta_percent_ref_ of filers who were in the poorest income group in _meta_number_ref_ had moved into a higher income category by _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 nearly _meta_percent_ref_ jumped into the middle or upper middle income groups and _meta_number_ref_ _meta_percent_ref_ made it all the way to the highest quintile _meta_end_dot_

 of those in the second lowest income quintile nearly _meta_percent_ref_ moved into the middle quintile or higher and only _meta_percent_ref_ moved down _meta_end_dot_

 this is a stunning show of upward mobility meaning that more than half of all lower income americans in _meta_number_ref_ had moved up the income scale in only _meta_number_ref_ years _meta_end_dot_

 also encouraging is the fact that the after inflation median income of all tax filers increased by an impressive _meta_percent_ref_ over the same period _meta_end_dot_

 two of every three workers had a real income gain which contradicts the huckabee edwards lou dobbs spin about stagnant incomes _meta_end_dot_

 this is even more impressive when you consider that median income and wage numbers are often skewed downward because the u s _meta_end_dot_

 has had a huge influx of young workers and immigrants in the last _meta_number_ref_ years _meta_end_dot_

 they start their work years with low wages dragging down the averages _meta_end_dot_

 those who start at the bottom but hold full time jobs nonetheless enjoyed steady income gains _meta_end_dot_

 the treasury study found that those tax filers who were in the poorest income quintile in _meta_number_ref_ saw a near doubling of their incomes _meta_number_ref_ _meta_percent_ref_ over the subsequent decade _meta_end_dot_

 those in the highest quintile on the other hand saw only modest income gains _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 the nearby table tells the story which is that the poorer an individual or household was in _meta_number_ref_ the greater the percentage income gain after _meta_number_ref_ years _meta_end_dot_

 only one income group experienced an absolute decline in real income the richest _meta_percent_ref_ in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 those households lost _meta_number_ref_ _meta_percent_ref_ of their income _meta_end_dot_

 moreover more than half _meta_number_ref_ _meta_percent_ref_ of the richest _meta_percent_ref_ in _meta_number_ref_ had dropped to a lower income group by _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 some of these people might have been rich merely for one year or perhaps for several as they hit their peak earning years or had some capital gains windfall _meta_end_dot_

 others may simply have not been able to keep up with new entrepreneurs and wealth creators _meta_end_dot_

 the key point is that the study shows that income mobility in the u s _meta_end_dot_

 works down as well as up another sign that opportunity and merit continue to drive american success not accidents of birth _meta_end_dot_

 the rich are not the same people over time _meta_end_dot_

 the study is also valuable because it shows that income mobility remains little changed from what similar studies found in the _meta_number_ref_s and _meta_number_ref_s _meta_end_dot_

 some journalists and academics have cited selective evidence to claim that income mobility has declined in recent years _meta_end_dot_

 but the _meta_percent_ref_ of lowest income earners who moved to a higher income quintile in this study is roughly comparable to the percentages that did so in several similar studies going back to the late _meta_number_ref_s the wall street journal
