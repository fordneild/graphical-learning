  in the last hundred years there may not have been a single candidate who has come so far so fast with such a minimal amount of talent for politics as hillary clinton _meta_end_dot_

 following last week s democratic debate in iowa the fix had the unique opportunity to sit in on focus groups conducted by the washington post _meta_end_dot_

 during the democratic session led by the post s dan balz and david broder the group of _meta_number_ref_ undecided voters was asked for their impressions about the debate and their general thoughts about the field of candidates _meta_end_dot_

 as always when a group of democrats are gathered the conversation was dominated by sen _meta_end_dot_

 hillary rodham clinton n y and revealed the problems and potential clinton has in iowa and beyond _meta_end_dot_

 asked to say whatever first came to mind when clinton s name was mentioned the group offered a fascinating panoply of descriptions _meta_end_dot_

 can t be trusted said one _meta_end_dot_

 i just got a glimpse that she s got an evil side to her said another _meta_end_dot_

 a third offered a backhanded compliment of sorts very good at saying what she thinks we want to hear others were more positive in their remarks if not effusive _meta_end_dot_

 work ethic said one i think she s really focused said another _meta_end_dot_

 the comments signal a larger theme when it comes to voters views in iowa and nationally about clinton _meta_end_dot_

 she is widely respected but not widely liked _meta_end_dot_

 time and again in last week s focus group the voters said they had few doubts about clinton s ability to do the job of president they also expressed a frustration with the essential unknowability of clinton as a person _meta_end_dot_

 take away her husband and the ridiculously favorable press she gets because of him and what does she have going for her _meta_end_question_

 almost nothing _meta_end_dot_

 she comes across as cold and manipulative _meta_end_dot_

 liberals even many of the liberals who support her don t like or trust her _meta_end_dot_

 she has a very minimal level of charisma _meta_end_dot_

 her political tactics are condescending to the point of being insulting to the voters _meta_end_dot_

 for example when she decided that obama s message of change was beating her message of experience which isn t surprising given that she doesn t have much experience herself she decided to steal obama s message of change _meta_end_dot_

 did she try to do that by actually proposing some kind of change _meta_end_question_

 no she repeated the word change _meta_number_ref_ million times with the idea being that people will buy her as the candidate of change just because she says the word so many times _meta_end_dot_

 her idea of convincing people that she s warm and friendly isn t to actually be warm and friendly it s to trot her husband and more pathetically her mother out to tell people what a nice person she is _meta_end_dot_

 in a time where bipartisanship is highly valued by the public she is one of the most polarizing figures on the left _meta_end_dot_

 in a time where the public is complaining about a culture of corruption she has more scandals associated with her than the whole rest of the republican and democratic field combined _meta_end_dot_

 yet the least likable most corrupt most dishonest least competent politician in the race is supposed to be the favorite to win the nomination and the presidency _meta_end_question_

 don t bet on it _meta_end_dot_

 one way or the other there are just too many people who want to see hillary taste the defeat that she so richly deserves _meta_end_dot_
