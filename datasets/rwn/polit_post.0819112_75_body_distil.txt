  in all seriousness are people wearing these shirts _meta_end_question_

 i mean despite the fact that these shirts are fascinating sort of the same way a train wreck is i just don t see jonah goldberg or michelle malkin wearing these shirts to the mall _meta_end_dot_

 be forewarned there is an obscenity on one of the shirts and the stunningly hot model even though she appears to be doing the shoot on a warm sunny street seems to have perhaps just walked out of the freezer at a local meat packing plant ps just because i am curious would you actually wear either of these t shirts _meta_end_question_

 yes yes but just around the house and in the yard yes as a goof or to a costume party no free polls from pollhost com
