  if you re like me the second the debate ended you got on your computer to check whether the consensus in the blogosphere jived with your own impressions of the first presidential debate _meta_end_dot_

 i discovered that the general consensus from both liberal and conservative bloggers was that mccain scored on points _meta_end_dot_

 he held his own on the economy and came into his own on foreign policy an area in which obama distinguished himself as a complete ignoramus _meta_end_dot_

 to see him try to argue his way out of his no preconditions statements was amusing _meta_end_dot_

 i happen to be somewhat concerned though that the average american doesn t react to the debates in the same way as we internet political junkies do _meta_end_dot_

 when we watch the debates we know the facts and arguments as well as the candidates do _meta_end_dot_

 when obama lies we recognize those lies for what they are _meta_end_dot_

 when mccain begins a good argument and then gets lost in elliptical phrasing or jargon we still understand precisely what it is he actually meant to say and are able to applaud the thought _meta_end_dot_

 the average american though sees things a little differently _meta_end_dot_

 obama has the lawyer s practiced skill of being able to keep his lips moving and sound coming out even as his brain his empty _meta_end_dot_

 although his eyes looked a bit panicky he kept emitting subjects and verbs and objects _meta_end_dot_

 you and i knew that what he was saying was nonsense or canned or irrelevant or dishonest but the average less informed viewer heard only a smooth flow of subject and verb and object _meta_end_dot_

 the opposite was true with mccain _meta_end_dot_

 mccain like bush _meta_number_ref_ before him can lapse into a telegraphic style of speech where he starts a thought pauses and then abandons that thought to go on to a new one _meta_end_dot_

 in his own mind he s fully conveyed what he wished to say _meta_end_dot_

 the auditor however feels as if he is left hanging _meta_end_dot_

 you and i can fill in those blanks because we know the facts but the average listener may be waiting for the object that should have been attached to that subject verb formulation _meta_end_dot_

 this means that i m a little less sanguine than blogosphere commenters who focusing on substance awarded more points to mccain than to obama _meta_end_dot_

 still i m not completely down hearted and that s because i think obama may have destroyed himself with a single statement _meta_end_dot_

 those single statements can be killers _meta_end_dot_

 sometimes they kill the person at whom they re directed and sometimes they kill the person speaking _meta_end_dot_

 you recall all of these don t you _meta_end_question_

 who am i _meta_end_question_

 why am i here meant to be rhetorical but sounding inept and bewildered it was the start of the debacle that was poor admiral stockdale s vp debate and contributed significantly to the meaninglessness of ross perot s presidential run _meta_end_dot_

 there you go again with that one statement ronald reagan made jimmy carter sound like a fool _meta_end_dot_

 and it was delivered so sweetly _meta_end_dot_

 it wasn t angry _meta_end_dot_

 instead it was the sort of fond exasperation a parent feels for the child who just can t get it right _meta_end_dot_

 senator you re no jack kennedy the pundits loved it _meta_end_dot_

 lloyd bentsen decimated the boyish looking and republican dan quayle by putting him firmly in his place for having the temerity to compare himself to that democratic icon jack kennedy _meta_end_dot_

 it didn t matter that if he ran today kennedy s policies would more closely align him with the republicans _meta_end_dot_

 the insult was enough _meta_end_dot_

 and from yesterday s debate i ve got a bracelet too a lot of conservatives want to give obama heat for the fact that he couldn t remember the name on his bracelet but i actually find that forgivable _meta_end_dot_

 obama was in the hot seat and at moments like that at least if you re me names are the first thing to go _meta_end_dot_

 the sin wasn t the memory failure the sin was that he made the statement in the first place _meta_end_dot_

 let s start with some context in connection with his belief that there is no peace and honor without victory john mccain told the moving story of the moment matthew stanley s mother gave mccain matthew s bracelet and asked him to wear it and more importantly to honor and give meaning to matthew s death by making the iraq war an american defeat not an american victory _meta_end_dot_

 obama had he wanted to could have scored some substantive points by immediately saying that we don t honor one man s death by creating more dead or some such argument _meta_end_dot_

 that seemed to be where he was heading but i tuned out because i was so overwhelmed by his actual response i ve got a bracelet too what is this _meta_end_question_

 kindergarten _meta_end_question_

 could anything show more clearly what a selfish self centered shallow man obama is _meta_end_question_

 mccain is talking about real people and he s talking about how the beliefs he shares with those real people drive him to his understanding that both for the good of the nation and for the honor of her troops america must leave iraq as a strong viable nation _meta_end_dot_

 it breaks faith with both america and her troops to slink away as obama so wants to do _meta_end_dot_

 this is a deep substantive argument _meta_end_dot_

 the bracelet wasn t the central point _meta_end_dot_

 it was simply a human interest lead in to that point _meta_end_dot_

 and what does obama say _meta_end_question_

 i ve got a bracelet too what that means translated is i can t think of an original argument i don t have a deep emotional story i don t have sound policy justifications for abandoning iraq now that we re trembling on the verge of actual and complete success but nyah nyah nyah nyah nyah i ve got a bracelet too the attitude and ignorance behind the statement was appalling _meta_end_dot_

 if this was just one example it would be bad enough but we ve seen this before _meta_end_dot_

 when hillary the darling of huge chunks of american women self deprecatingly and rather charmingly acknowledges that she grates on some people obama snaps back with the condescending you re likable enough if i d been hillary i would have marched across the stage and bitten him _meta_end_dot_

 so i suspect would all of her female followers _meta_end_dot_

 and then when palin comes on the scene this man of indonesia hawaii and chicago suddenly discovers his inner southerner and when speaking of republican policies comes out with an old southern expression you can put lipstick on a pig _meta_end_dot_

 it s still a pig at that moment the remaining chunk of american women who aren t obama acolytes lunged for their tv screens teeth bared _meta_end_dot_

 the msm no doubt recognizing how damaging this statement is going to downplay i ve got a bracelet too in the hope that it doesn t enter the pantheon of memorable moments in debate history _meta_end_dot_

 it s therefore our responsibility to make sure that this telling moment into obama s character does not vanish into the abyss _meta_end_dot_
