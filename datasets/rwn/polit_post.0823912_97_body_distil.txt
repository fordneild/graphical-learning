  something about this story really rubs me the wrong way a connecticut youth baseball team with a phenomenal _meta_number_ref_ year old pitcher has been disqualified because its team is too good _meta_end_dot_

 the team will power fitness has an _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ record thanks in large part to pitcher jericho scott the new haven register reports _meta_end_dot_

 his pitching is so fast and accurate the liga juvenil de baseball de new haven asked the team s coach wilfred vidro to replace him so he wouldn t frighten other players _meta_end_dot_

 the spirit of the league was community family well being nurturing peter noble the league s attorney told the register _meta_end_dot_

 it s an extended family and it s been disrupted on saturday jericho and his team showed up to the ballfield despite the fact the league canceled the game because they feared an unhealthy environment due to parental bickering noble told the paper _meta_end_dot_

 jericho s parents nicole and leroy planned to meet with an attorney on monday _meta_end_dot_

 the scotts said the league which is not affiliated with the little league wanted jericho to play for a stronger team _meta_end_dot_

 the parents and the coach claim the reason is because that team is sponsored by a local barbershop where the league s president currently cuts hair the paper reported _meta_end_dot_

 there s nothing new about this sort of thing _meta_end_dot_

 in fact when i was a kid playing pee wee football we had another child that they moved up to an older division just because he was so much bigger than the rest of us _meta_end_dot_

 still there s something just so _meta_number_ref_ about disqualifying a team because it s too good it s sick and wrong that liberal ideas about punishing excellence and successful people being mere winners of life s lottery has filtered all the way down to baseball games being played by nine year olds _meta_end_dot_

 in this country we should be rewarding excellence and heaping honors on successful people not trying to hide their abilities to make other people feel better about themselves _meta_end_dot_

 that s how you make a better life and a better country by lifting people up not trying to shove exceptional people down to make everyone else feel better about not measuring up _meta_end_dot_
