 i know under obama it will only be a matter of time until the country sees the legalization of gay marriage genre editor neal boulton you ever notice that democrats like john kerry and barack obama say that they oppose gay marriage just like republicans do but most of their own supporters just assume they re lying about it _meta_end_question_

 that s a common trend by the way _meta_end_dot_

 whenever democrats say something about supporting the military being patriotic capitalism supporting the _meta_number_ref_nd amendment wanting to decrease the number of abortions etc etc you ever notice that the people on the left who have the exact opposite views seldom seem to mind _meta_end_question_

 could that be because liberals as liberals understand that their views are way out of the mainstream and that the politicians they support have to lie to get elected _meta_end_question_

 so they all just accept that on certain topics the democratic party will have to lie about what they believe until they get enough power to implement their views over the protests of the american people _meta_end_question_

 once you understand that you ll understand why lying about their beliefs comes as naturally to liberal democrats as swimming does to fish _meta_end_dot_
