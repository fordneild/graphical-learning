  he made it official this morning via memeo washington ralph nader said sunday he will run for president as a third party candidate criticizing the top white house contenders as too close to big business and pledging to repeat a bid that will shift the power from the few to the many nader _meta_number_ref_ said most people are disenchanted with the democratic and republican parties due to a prolonged iraq war and a shaky economy _meta_end_dot_

 the consumer advocate also blamed tax and other corporate friendly policies under the bush administration that he said have left many lower and middle class people in debt _meta_end_dot_

 you take that framework of people feeling locked out shut out marginalized and disrespected he said _meta_end_dot_

 you go from iraq to palestine to israel from enron to wall street from katrina to the bumbling of the bush administration to the complicity of the democrats in not stopping him on the war stopping him on the tax cuts in that context i have decided to run for president nader told nbc s meet the press nader also criticized republican candidate john mccain and democrats barack obama and hillary rodham clinton for failing to support full medicare for all or cracking down on pentagon waste and a bloated military budget _meta_end_dot_

 he blamed that on corporate lobbyists and special interests which he said dominate washington d c and pledged in his third party campaign to accept donations only from individuals _meta_end_dot_

 the issue is do they have the moral courage do they have the fortitude to stand up to corporate powers and get things done for the american people nader said _meta_end_dot_

 we have to shift the power from the few to the many i don t think this will have much of an effect on the presidential election primarily because democrats believe that nader s third party run in _meta_number_ref_ cost the goracle the presidency well they believe that and also that the ussc stole the election for bushitler _meta_end_dot_

 nader s just doing one of the things he does best and that is stealing a little limelight for himself and creating a few waves generating a buzz that will i believe be shortlived _meta_end_dot_

 in response to the news dem frontrunner barack obama had this to say mr _meta_end_dot_

 nader is somebody who if you don t listen and adopt all of his policies thinks you re not substantive _meta_end_dot_

 he seems to have a pretty high opinion of his own work he went on to praise the longtime consumer advocate as a singular figure in america who has done as much as just about anybody on behalf of consumers i don t mean to diminish him he said _meta_end_dot_

 i do think there is a sense now that if somebody is not hewing to the ralph nader agenda then you must be lacking in some way hat tip to st reader mwalimu daudi who said in response oh really _meta_end_question_

 i mean democrats have never themselves done that _meta_end_dot_

 except on issues like the iraq war free health care global warming defense spending taxes abortion hate crime laws earmarks trade education government regulation etc _meta_end_dot_

 i will remember obama s quotes in november when he and others in the democrat party are demonizing mccain and the gop for not agreeing with democrats _meta_percent_ref_ of the time _meta_end_dot_

 the captain believes obama s bigger worry could be nyc mayor michael bloomberg should he decide to throw his hat into the ring and that a combination of both bloomberg and nader could hurt bo in the general _meta_end_dot_

 the great thomas sowell has written about ralph nader many times and has often described how the only person ralph nader is interested in shifting the power to is himself _meta_end_dot_

 in this march _meta_number_ref_ piece mr _meta_end_dot_

 sowell noted correctly for decades before ralph nader came on the scene automobile fatality rates were declining despite more cars on the streets and highways traveling at faster speeds _meta_end_dot_

 the automobile fatality rate per miles driven was less than one third as high when unsafe at any speed was published as it was back in the _meta_number_ref_s _meta_end_dot_

 but facts never carry as much weight as a dramatic vision of corporate greed sacrificing helpless consumers until they are rescued by consumer advocates and federal regulations _meta_end_dot_

 for the left nader was playing their song and they danced to it _meta_end_dot_

 although the term consumer advocate has acquired a certain halo in the media there are no qualifications whatever required to be called a consumer advocate _meta_end_dot_

 moreover nader was never a consumer advocate in any real sense _meta_end_dot_

 he was a nader advocate then and he is a nader advocate now when he runs for office oblivious to his friends and supporters _meta_end_dot_

 in one of his earliest writings nader said the consumer must be protected at times from his own indiscretion and vanity in other words he wanted the ralph naders of the world to be able to dictate to consumers and producers alike _meta_end_dot_

 it s all about him _meta_end_dot_

 so is running for president _meta_end_dot_

 the reuters piece on nader s announcement described him as a consumer advocate proving that you can fool some people some of the time but you can fool the media all the time and they will in turn try to fool you too _meta_end_dot_

 semi related michael van der galien implores the media to move beyond their obsession with the belief that obama could be assassinated _meta_end_dot_

 bob owens also blogged about this back in late january _meta_end_dot_
