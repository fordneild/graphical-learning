  the associated press provides one of their best gee ya think so headlines of the year push to register felons to vote could aid obama undaunted by the heat james bailey spent his late summer afternoons walking virginia s bleakest neighborhoods on the hunt for ex cons each a potential voter who might cast the decisive ballot in this hotly contested state _meta_end_dot_

 finding them isn t the hard part _meta_end_dot_

 it s getting them to admit that a past mistake has kept them from the ballot box _meta_end_dot_

 people are really really reluctant to say i lost my rights to vote bailey said of his quest which continued in the run up to monday s registration deadline in virginia for the november election _meta_end_dot_

 nationally there are roughly _meta_number_ref_ million released felons whose convictions have cost them the right to vote at least temporarily if not permanently _meta_end_dot_

 to return to the ballot box felons must negotiate suffrage laws that vary from state to state in many cases working with election officials who can be both unfamiliar with the law and hostile to former convicts seeking to register _meta_end_dot_

 such challenges matter little to bailey and others trying to return former criminals to voter rolls an effort they consider crucial in light of the results of the past two presidential elections a shift of a few hundred votes in florida in _meta_number_ref_ would have changed the outcome of the presidential race and the results in _meta_number_ref_ came down to a margin of _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ votes in ohio the nonprofit groups and individual activists making the push on felons behalf agree the effort is broader this year than in previous elections even if they aren t necessarily making a coordinated push _meta_end_dot_

 they expect that effort to benefit barack obama more than john mccain given that the population of former felons is disproportionately black _meta_end_dot_

 first they still can t get over bush s two presidential wins _meta_end_dot_

 sad really _meta_end_dot_

 second it always seems to be the case that giving felons the right to vote helps democrats and it is not just because so many are black _meta_end_dot_

 a good guess would probably be that criminals know that punishment for what they do is much less under democrats usually along the lines of a short sentence which is then reduced as time served and some therapy _meta_end_dot_

 third have you ever noticed that the democrat party keeps up the pressure to register the most politically clueless along with those who are offering nothing to society _meta_end_question_

 felons the homeless college kids who think they will get free drinking money illegal aliens etc _meta_end_dot_

 if someone was really interested in the issues and in voting well they would get their butts out there and register themselves _meta_end_dot_

 it really isn t that hard _meta_end_dot_

 if you do not have the will to go register yourself maybe you should sit on the sidelines and watch _meta_end_dot_

 oh and in ohio register and vote land what must a voter do to prove they re a qualified eligible voter when they register and vote at the same time _meta_end_question_

 anyone who registers to vote must fill out the same paperwork whether they do it in person minutes before voting or at any other time _meta_end_dot_

 you are not required to show identification but must provide either your driver s license number or the last four digits of your social security number maybe if people would be required to show id it would only be a tiny problem _meta_end_dot_

 you know that thing you need to show to pass a check use your credit card not that companies taking your cc look at them that much anymore and are required to have on your person when you drive _meta_end_dot_

 something that is rather easy to get and not that expensive _meta_end_dot_

 but we can all infer why democrats do not want people to have to show id to vote _meta_end_dot_
