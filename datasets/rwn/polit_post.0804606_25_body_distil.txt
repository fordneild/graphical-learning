  the obama campaign seems dangerously close to becoming a cult of personality paul krugman if even paul krugman is willing to publicly admit that barack obama is a human featherball a slick smiling substance free empty suit who excites gullible dimwits by repeating the words change unity and hope over and over then who am i a mere conservative blogger to disagree _meta_end_question_

 but is being black charismatic and having a good voice enough to qualify a man to be president of the united states _meta_end_question_

 if so maybe the gop should see if we can get james earl jones or the rock to run as mccain s veep _meta_end_dot_

 they re both charismatic they re both black and as an added bonus neither of them is significantly less qualified to be president of the united states than barack obama _meta_end_dot_

 remember when they used to say that dan quayle a man who was in the national guard served _meta_number_ref_ terms in the house and was elected to the senate twice before he was selected as vice president was too inexperienced to be considered for the job _meta_end_question_

 yet now that barack obama is running for president in a post _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ world no less he s being treated as if he s qualified to be president _meta_end_dot_

 the reality is that obama has a lot in common with harriet miers _meta_end_dot_

 yes he has accomplished a lot in his life compared to most people just as she had but she was still completely unqualified for the job she wanted to fill just as barack obama is completely unqualified to be president of the united states _meta_end_dot_

 of course barack can t afford to wait around and get some seasoning because in another term or two his incredibly liberal voting record in the senate would make him unelectable _meta_end_dot_

 he is after all the single most liberal senator in the entire senate _meta_end_dot_

 do you realize what that means _meta_end_question_

 it means that ted kennedy dick durbin and chuck schumer are all to barack obama s right _meta_end_dot_

 incidentally this is what democrats mean by change the ideas of jimmy carter ted kennedy and dennis kucinich being mouthed by a young black man instead of an old white man _meta_end_dot_

 it s sort of like the democratic idea of diversity which encompasses a white man a white woman and a black man espousing the exact same liberal ideas _meta_end_dot_

 but before it s too late maybe some of barack obama s supporters should try to pin him down on exactly what kind of changes he supports before he gets into office and pushes a trillion dollar tax hike partial birth abortion and giving drivers licenses to illegal immigrants _meta_end_dot_

 my guess is that isn t exactly the sort of change that most of the country is hoping for _meta_end_dot_

 along similar lines how exactly is someone as far off to the left as rush limbaugh is to the right going to be able to unify the country _meta_end_question_

 heck barack obama can t even unify liberals _meta_end_dot_

 his supporters are calling the clinton backers racists hillary s fans are claiming barack s voters hate women you have liberals threatening to leave the democratic party if the democratic super delegates don t vote for barack and we re talking about people who generally agree with each other on just about everything _meta_end_dot_

 what happens when barack obama a man who has written that he favors outlawing handguns is against the death penalty and deliberately favors losing the war in iraq for political purposes has to unify liberals and conservatives _meta_end_question_

 now you may say the right and left are too far apart in this country to be unified and nobody could pull it off which could turn out to be true _meta_end_dot_

 however don t tell me that tell obama because unifying the country is a central part of his campaign and he s asking people to vote for him on that basis _meta_end_dot_

 then there s barack s constant talk about hope which shows you just what a bunch of sad sacks are buying into o bambi s fast talk _meta_end_dot_

 keep in mind we don t live in sudan mexico afghanistan belarus or some other hellhole where the biggest hope most people have is to leave we live in the united states of america _meta_end_dot_

 millions of people come here every year and millions more are waiting to get here because this country represents hope and opportunity to people across the world _meta_end_dot_

 so if you re the sort of person who is in the united states is hopeless and believes that barack obama is going to bring you hope through the same federal government that is responsible for fema the irs and ice then there may truly be no hope for you _meta_end_dot_

 with that in mind before we elect one of the single least qualified presidents in the history of the united states to foist a ted kennedyesque vision of government on the country maybe people should start asking a few tough questions instead of cooing like pigeons because barack obama keeps spewing out the sort of substance less pap you typically expect to see on hallmark cards _meta_end_dot_
