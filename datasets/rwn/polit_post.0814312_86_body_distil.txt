  last night late after american idol and the delight in david cook s success after the news a friend her kids and her kid s friends showed up at the door and kidnapped me _meta_end_dot_

 the destination _meta_end_question_

 the opening show _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ a m of indiana jones and the kingdom of the crystal skull _meta_end_dot_

 well i wanted to to see the movie anyway why not stay up until _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ a m _meta_end_dot_

 on a week night _meta_end_question_

 i had more than a couple reasons but went anyway encouraged by the positive reviews coming out of cannes i decided in the spirit of teenagers everywhere what the hell _meta_end_question_

 speaking of teenagers and indy nerds generally two mega theaters were not quite sold out but they were full and it was midnight _meta_end_dot_

 long lines filled with grinning people congregated _meta_end_dot_

 i imagine that this is what it felt like to be in portland waiting for barack obama _meta_end_dot_

 dude it was an experience _meta_end_dot_

 a young indiana showed up with his beautiful sidekick marion one presumes _meta_end_dot_

 the crowd clapped at the opening credits _meta_end_dot_

 whoops came at exciting parts _meta_end_dot_

 this was a crowd that would be easy to please _meta_end_dot_

 before i share what bugs me about the film let me just say that the requisite one liners snappy dialogue and nail biting action sequences filled the screen _meta_end_dot_

 the familiar john williams score made me feel nostalgic _meta_end_dot_

 and harrison ford is old and seems to be lost in actual irony _meta_end_dot_

 his age is acknowledged right off the bat and then five minute later he s beating men senseless half his age _meta_end_dot_

 he looks pretty believable doing it _meta_end_dot_

 well kinda believable _meta_end_dot_

 and that brings me to what bugs me about the film _meta_end_dot_

 the overall tone was the problem _meta_end_dot_

 warning mild spoilers ahead _meta_end_dot_

 do not read further if you want to flinch at every surprise the movie opens at area _meta_number_ref_ the russian bad guys headed by wacky parapsychologist and lenin lover irina spelkt cate blanchett want something and they mow down five innocent american soldiers at the entry check point to get it _meta_end_dot_

 the audience collectively flinched but what i found disconcerting was the way the camera lingered and there was no outrage or sense of wrongness about this event _meta_end_dot_

 those deaths don t get avenged _meta_end_dot_

 it s irritating as hell _meta_end_dot_

 indy is in one of the trucks he s there _meta_end_dot_

 one pithy line of vengeance but no _meta_end_dot_

 they are american soldiers _meta_end_dot_

 they deserve to die _meta_end_dot_

 it gets worse _meta_end_dot_

 indy escapes and ends up back at his college campus where mccarthyism has taken root and poor indy is being suspected as a traitor _meta_end_dot_

 the emphasis throughout is not on communism s badness but america s ridiculousness and that takes some plot slowing turns or rather it isn t instead of plunging into the thick of things we have to spend some time with indy back on campus where concerns about his patriotism see him dismissed from his position how dare anyone question anyone s patriotism _meta_end_question_

 a communism protest gets run over _meta_end_dot_

 an all american town gets torched _meta_end_dot_

 a sympathetic hero gets swift boated _meta_end_dot_

 ten minutes in i wanted to throw up _meta_end_dot_

 my friend just found it boring which it was _meta_end_dot_

 and so it went _meta_end_dot_

 the adventure takes indy all over the globe again _meta_end_dot_

 his youthful sidekick just seemed wrongly cast _meta_end_dot_

 the story is choppy and there is one glaring plot hole that is still bugging the hell out of me _meta_end_dot_

 after you guys all see it maybe you ll have an answer but i ve wracked my brain and have come up with a big fat nothing _meta_end_dot_

 i ll be curious about how indy fans take this movie _meta_end_dot_

 i give it _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ stars _meta_end_dot_

 vote once you see it _meta_end_dot_

 indiana jones and the kingdom of the crystal skull was awesome horrible meh pollcode com free polls cross posted at dr _meta_end_dot_
