  by allowing illegal aliens to get pregnant waltz across our border and get free health care and citizenship for their children we re encouraging the worst sort of behavior _meta_end_dot_

 it was _meta_number_ref_ a m _meta_end_dot_

 and cbs news national correspondent byron pitts is with a woman who is nine months pregnant _meta_end_dot_

 she s rushed to a south texas hospital to undergo a c section a _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ medical procedure that won t cost her a dime _meta_end_dot_

 she qualifies for emergency medicaid _meta_end_dot_

 she gave birth to a healthy _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ pound baby boy born in america _meta_end_dot_

 his mexican mother gave him an american name eliot _meta_end_dot_

 eliot is one of an estimated _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ children of illegal immigrants born in the united states every year according to the pew hispanic center _meta_end_dot_

 they re given instant citizenship because they are born on u s _meta_end_dot_

 soil which makes it easier for their parents to become u s _meta_end_dot_

 citizens _meta_end_dot_

 that s because those babies can eventually sponsor their parents when they turn _meta_number_ref_ years old _meta_end_dot_

 back in december when she was six months pregnant fabiola her husband and their two daughters ages _meta_number_ref_ and _meta_number_ref_ crossed the rio grande from mexico into the u s _meta_end_dot_

 once on the other side of the river they walked for two hours in search of a better life and free medical care for their unborn child _meta_end_dot_

 do many women in mexico make the choice to have their children in the united states pitts asked _meta_end_dot_

 yes she said through a translator _meta_end_dot_

 i know people who have done that _meta_end_dot_

 things are much better here in the u s _meta_end_dot_

 because they help children so much more it s a better life _meta_end_dot_

 that american taxpayers help pay for _meta_end_dot_

 take healthcare for example an estimated _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ billion per year for undocumented men women and children according to the rand corporation _meta_end_dot_

 joe riley is the ceo of the mcallen texas medical center near the texas mexico border _meta_end_dot_

 forty percent of the children born there nearly _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ last year were the babies of illegal immigrants _meta_end_dot_

 riley has seen and heard it all _meta_end_dot_

 mothers about to give birth that walk up to the hospital still wet from swimming across the river in actual labor dirty wet cold he said _meta_end_dot_

 but here to have a child _meta_end_question_

 here to have a child in the u s he said _meta_end_dot_

 that child _meta_end_question_

 he shouldn t be granted american citizenship _meta_end_dot_

 that mother _meta_end_question_

 she should be permanently banned from getting citizenship or even visiting the u s _meta_end_dot_

 at all and the government of mexico should be sent a _meta_dollor_ref_ bill for the medical care she received _meta_end_dot_

 why _meta_end_question_

 because when you subsidize behavior you get more of it _meta_end_dot_

 so if we reward women for coming into the united states illegally and having babies which is exactly what our system does today we shouldn t be surprised when they do just that _meta_end_dot_

 ps if you look carefully at the wording of the _meta_number_ref_th amendment i do think we could constitutionally deny birthright citizenship to the children of illegals _meta_end_dot_
