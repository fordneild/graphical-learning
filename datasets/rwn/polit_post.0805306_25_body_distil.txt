  for the first time in my adult life i am really proud of my country because it feels like hope is making a comeback michelle obama is that a surprising sentiment to hear from a woman who wants to be first lady _meta_end_question_

 you might think so until you realize that she is married to a man who doesn t hold his hand over his heart for the pledge of allegiance and makes a big deal out of not wearing a flag pin _meta_end_dot_

 those two would make a great first couple of cuba or maybe venezuela _meta_end_dot_

 granted they might be a little to the left of the people in charge now but if anybody needs empty feel good speeches featuring lots of sesame street rhetoric about change hope and unity it s the citizens of cuba and venezuela _meta_end_dot_

 but since the obamas patriotism is as thin as barack s resume maybe someone should take the time to explain to them why they should appreciate this country _meta_end_dot_

 to begin with we live in a super power with the greatest military and economy the world has ever seen _meta_end_dot_

 we re also the longest surviving democracy in the world and our example has inspired hundreds of millions of people across the world to seek freedom for themselves and their families and often we have helped them _meta_end_dot_

 we ve done more to promote freedom and democracy in the world than any other dozen countries combined and we still do _meta_end_dot_

 we ve expended immense amounts of blood and treasure to help keep _meta_number_ref_ million afghans and iraqis free our military ensures that there s peace in nations like taiwan and south korea and if not for our support israel would probably long since have been annihilated by its genocidal neighbors _meta_end_dot_

 then there s south korea el salvador grenada you can go on and on with a list of nations whose freedom in some form or fashion that we ve had a hand in _meta_end_dot_

 we ve also fought time and time again in the _meta_number_ref_th century when the forces of darkness threatened to engulf the world _meta_end_dot_

 our entry into wwi utterly changed the course of the war _meta_end_dot_

 in wwii without our help the allies could not have defeated the axis _meta_end_dot_

 then there was the cold war where we prevented the soviets from spreading their evil ideology across the planet _meta_end_dot_

 afterwards it was just as colin powell said and when all those conflicts were over what did we do _meta_end_question_

 did we stay and conquer _meta_end_question_

 did we say okay we defeated germany _meta_end_dot_

 now germany belongs to us _meta_end_question_

 we defeated japan so japan belongs to us no _meta_end_dot_

 what did we do _meta_end_question_

 we built them up _meta_end_dot_

 we gave them democratic systems which they have embraced totally to their soul _meta_end_dot_

 and did we ask for any land _meta_end_question_

 no the only land we ever asked for was enough land to bury our dead _meta_end_dot_

 and that is the kind of nation we are _meta_end_dot_

 it is indeed the kind of nation we are because the american people while not perfect are fundamentally good hard working ambitious christian folk who want to do the right thing not just for our country but for the world _meta_end_dot_

 that s why we are have been and will continue to be the nation that does the most to promote freedom capitalism and democracy around the world _meta_end_dot_

 it s why americans give more than the citizens of any other country _meta_end_dot_

 it s why we re usually the first nation on the spot helping out after a major disaster in another country _meta_end_dot_

 it s why food grown by americans feeds starving people all over the planet _meta_end_dot_

 it s why drugs created and delivered by americans cure the sick across the world _meta_end_dot_

 it s why people all over the planet have been able to with the help of americans raise themselves up out of grinding poverty and make better lives for their families _meta_end_dot_

 the barack obamas of the world don t see this because as machiavelli once said they have imagined for themselves republics and principalities that have never been seen or known to exist in reality and they compare our nation to those fairy tale kingdoms _meta_end_dot_

 it s very easy to look at how we defeated the indians and took their land slavery and the other assorted grievances that barack s pals on the left have with america and conclude that we re a terrible nation but not if you compare us to other flesh and blood countries _meta_end_dot_

 when you do that especially when we re talking about other super powers through history that have had responsibilities across the world as opposed to toy poodle nations that make little difference in the world one way or another you ll find that no other country has done nearly as much for humanity as the good ol u s _meta_end_dot_

 of a _meta_end_dot_

 and despite the howls of the anti american left the muslim street socialist apparatchiks and western european snobs the world knows this in their souls _meta_end_dot_

 that s why we re called the land of opportunity it s why we have tens of millions of immigrants waiting in line to move here _meta_end_dot_

 it s why the same nations that sneer at us when things are going well run to us first for help when things turn bad _meta_end_dot_

 america is a good country and americans are a decent patriotic people that deserve a leader who is as proud to be a part of this nation as they are _meta_end_dot_

 what they don t deserve is an unpatriotic empty suit who actually thinks that it takes a certain audacity to have hope in a great nation like this one _meta_end_dot_
