  as it turns out the people of venezuela apparently don t want a dictator for life _meta_end_dot_

 caracas reuters venezuelan president hugo chavez has lost his lead eight days before a referendum on ending his term limit an independent pollster said on saturday in a swing in voter sentiment against the cuba ally _meta_end_dot_

 forty nine percent of likely voters oppose chavez s proposed raft of constitutional changes to expand his powers compared with _meta_number_ref_ percent in favor a survey by respected pollster datanalisis showed _meta_end_dot_

 just weeks ago chavez had a _meta_number_ref_ point lead for his proposed changes in the opec nation that must be approved in a referendum the polling company said _meta_end_dot_

 he ll probably win anyway given these rather ominous sounding statements despite the swing company head luis vicente leon said he did not rule out a comeback by the popular president _meta_end_dot_

 chavez has trounced the opposition at the polls on average once a year and can deploy a huge state backed machinery to get out the vote leon said _meta_end_dot_

 a huge state backed machinery to get out the vote _meta_end_dot_

 doesn t sound very democratic does it _meta_end_question_

 how would we americans feel if president bush had used the fbi or some other government agency to herd voters to the polls _meta_end_question_

 hell how do you think chavez s leftist supporters here in america would have felt about that _meta_end_question_

 and as innocuous as the term get out the vote seems it s likely that effort will include violence and intimidation _meta_end_dot_

 according to an npr report last year there are chavez foot soldiers in venezuela who control certain neighborhoods and mete out discipline to those criticizing hugo _meta_end_dot_

 which again isn t exactly democratic _meta_end_dot_

 in fact this pretty much means that chavez is a dictator _meta_end_dot_

 but hey jimmy carter was willing to certify the elections that put him in power despite the rampant voter intimidation so i guess it s all good _meta_end_dot_
