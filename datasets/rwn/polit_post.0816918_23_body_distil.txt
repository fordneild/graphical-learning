  b arack obama while doing a fundraiser in _meta_number_ref_ claimed i was a constitutional law professor which means unlike the current president i actually respect the constitution yet this constitutional law professor establishes the following as his criteria for selecting judges we need somebody who s got the heart the empathy to recognize what it s like to be a young teenage mom obama told a planned parenthood conference in washington d c in _meta_number_ref_ the empathy to understand what it s like to be poor or african american or gay or disabled or old _meta_end_dot_

 and that s the criteria by which i m going to be selecting my judges of justice alito obama once said i ve seen an extraordinarily consistent attitude on the part of judge alito that does not uphold the traditional role of the supreme court as a bastion of equality and justice for united states citizens a constitutional law professor should one would think understand the role of the federal judiciary _meta_end_dot_

 as should be apparent to anyone with a clue and i don t include senator obama in that particular group what he is claiming isn t anywhere close to the traditional role of the federal judiciary _meta_end_dot_

 what he is advocating is legislation from the bench based on emotion and empathy not the constitution _meta_end_dot_

 here in plain english is the role of the federal judiciary found in an introduction to the us federal court system for judges and judicial administrators in other countries _meta_end_dot_

 it may be something a particular constitutional lawyer may wish to avail himself of the federal judiciary is a totally separate selfgoverning branch of the government _meta_end_dot_

 the federal courts often are called the guardians of the constitution because their rulings protect the rights and liberties guaranteed by the constitution _meta_end_dot_

 through fair and impartial judgments they determine facts and interpret the law to resolve legal disputes _meta_end_dot_

 the courts do not make the laws _meta_end_dot_

 that is the responsibility of the congress _meta_end_dot_

 nor do the courts have the power to enforce the laws _meta_end_dot_

 that is the role of the president and the many executive branch departments and agencies _meta_end_dot_

 but the judicial branch has the authority to interpret and decide the constitutionality of federal laws and to resolve other disputes over federal laws _meta_end_dot_

 not a thing in that brief description approaches the obama criteria for federal judges _meta_end_dot_

 and folks given the fact he may win this election that should scare you half to death _meta_end_dot_
