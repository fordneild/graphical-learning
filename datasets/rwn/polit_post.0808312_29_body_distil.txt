  well folks i m going to depart from politics for a moment _meta_end_dot_

 for my blog readers that s not a surprise _meta_end_dot_

 lately all i ve been doing is departing from politics _meta_end_dot_

 for john s readers if you haven t visited my blog it will be a little different _meta_end_dot_

 the church bells ring behind me as i sit on my friend s porch _meta_end_dot_

 beyond the bell tower i see the gulf where the sun peeks through the clouds as i listen to ode to joy _meta_end_dot_

 it is a beautiful meaningful day for christians around the world _meta_end_dot_

 my friend s children exulted in easter baskets and delighted in found treasures _meta_end_dot_

 it has been magical watching another family revel in their tradition _meta_end_dot_

 holidays are a nice time to slow down take stock and refocus on what is truly important _meta_end_dot_

 some things in life are so transient and fleeting _meta_end_dot_

 the concept of eternity living forever puts the temporal in perspective _meta_end_dot_

 we aren t here for long and what consumes us day to day often matters little in the big scheme of things _meta_end_dot_

 now that concept is something that bothers unbelievers mightily _meta_end_dot_

 they feel that belief in god makes a person lazy both in thought and action _meta_end_dot_

 it excuses sin and forgives sloth _meta_end_dot_

 a christian won t reach his potential because he will wait for god s will _meta_end_dot_

 a christian loses his will when he surrenders to god _meta_end_dot_

 a christian knows this is not true _meta_end_dot_

 a christian is freed from having to control everything _meta_end_dot_

 a christian controls what is in his power to control and has faith that god is in charge taking care of the rest _meta_end_dot_

 far from absolving a person of responsibility the christian feels moved to do more with what he has because he has been given so much _meta_end_dot_

 okay so maybe i will talk politics for a minute _meta_end_dot_

 the messianic obsession this election cycle the live or die nature of the attachment to the candidates on the left does anyone feel super passionate about mccain _meta_end_question_

 i think blah feelings is what you get when you re a moderate reveals a true lack of faith generally _meta_end_dot_

 people look to people or people look to government which is just a bunch of people to do what people used to have faith that god would take care of _meta_end_dot_

 most of us have been recipients of christian charity at some point in our lives _meta_end_dot_

 i know i have _meta_end_dot_

 when my sons were in the hospital and every day was a financial struggle a church i used to attend sent me _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 no strings attached _meta_end_dot_

 they gave it in faith _meta_end_dot_

 and i used it in faith _meta_end_dot_

 it paid for food parking rent everything i couldn t afford while i was at the hospital _meta_end_dot_

 it was humbling _meta_end_dot_

 it was a bit embarrassing _meta_end_dot_

 i had never relied on anyone for anything and it was almost more than i could bear needing it so badly _meta_end_dot_

 it pricked my pride _meta_end_dot_

 in contrast when my son came out of the hospital we had no insurance _meta_end_dot_

 we were poor by any measure _meta_end_dot_

 he was _meta_number_ref_ pounds _meta_number_ref_ ounces we were heading into the winter season and one bout of a common cold rsv could kill him _meta_end_dot_

 i sucked up my pride once again and went to the welfare office _meta_end_dot_

 after hours waiting i talked to a very kind social worker who understood my plight but explained that we didn t qualify because our car was too new we needed a newer car because our old one couldn t make the trip to downtown reliably and we didn t want the car to die with me in it with a tiny sick baby _meta_end_dot_

 you do qualify for food stamps the man told me _meta_end_dot_

 i hung my head _meta_end_dot_

 no _meta_end_dot_

 way _meta_end_dot_

 there is no way i d go to the store and buy my food with food stamps baby or no _meta_end_dot_

 i d starve first _meta_end_dot_

 i politely declined and marveled at the horror and humiliation of the whole experience _meta_end_dot_

 now you might think that i cursed the government for their arcane rules where someone barely making it couldn t qualify to have a sick child covered _meta_end_dot_

 that wasn t my reaction _meta_end_dot_

 i decided then and there that we d have to make more money and we d find insurance one way or another and that i would never ever ever step foot in a government agency that way again _meta_end_dot_

 it was one of the most demeaning experiences of my life _meta_end_dot_

 the contrast was real _meta_end_dot_

 the church people gave and had faith in me but more so in god _meta_end_dot_

 it wasn t about me _meta_end_dot_

 it was about laying up treasure _meta_end_dot_

 and they weren t doing it to make brownie points for the afterlife and if they were they ve had their reward they were helping from a place of love _meta_end_dot_

 the government workers had tied hands _meta_end_dot_

 they had rules _meta_end_dot_

 they had limitations _meta_end_dot_

 they had to be wary of scammers _meta_end_dot_

 they were jaded and understandably so _meta_end_dot_

 had i been more wily i suppose i could have gamed the system _meta_end_dot_

 i could have lied about the car _meta_end_dot_

 i could have put things in other people s names _meta_end_dot_

 there were all sorts of things people did to comply but at what cost to the dignity of the individual and to the fabric of society as a whole _meta_end_question_

 believing in a man or a woman like the hillary and obama zealots do is bound to be disappointing _meta_end_dot_

 they are human fallible selfish people _meta_end_dot_

 they aren t god _meta_end_dot_

 today is a good day to remember who god is and who god isn t _meta_end_dot_

 only one person in history rose from the dead giving hope of a perfect government to the world and that person isn t running in this election _meta_end_dot_
