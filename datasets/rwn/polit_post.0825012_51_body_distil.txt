  via little green footballs we learn of the latest rasmussen a week ago most americans had never heard of alaska governor sarah palin _meta_end_dot_

 now following a vice presidential acceptance speech viewed live by more than _meta_number_ref_ million people palin is viewed favorably by _meta_percent_ref_ of american voters _meta_end_dot_

 perhaps most stunning is the fact that palin s favorable ratings are now a point higher than either man at the top of the presidential tickets this year _meta_end_dot_

 as of friday morning obama and mccain are each viewed favorably by _meta_percent_ref_ of voters _meta_end_dot_

 biden is viewed favorably by _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 great round up _meta_end_dot_

 traitor holy warrior connected to jack abramoff pregnant daughter and a lot of others _meta_end_dot_

 he forgot one though _meta_end_dot_

 palin is inexperienced _meta_end_dot_

 you ve heard that one right _meta_end_question_

 it just goes to show how desperate john mccain is because if he wants to pander to the female vote there are a whole lot of other women he could have named who are far more experienced _meta_end_dot_

 a couple days after hearing this i noticed this is one of the few anti palin talking points on which the left is not being sexist _meta_end_dot_

 or creative _meta_end_dot_

 it s the dan quayle rule twenty years old this year and it goes something like this born after pearl habor got it goin on upstairs conservative you may have two out of those three _meta_end_dot_

 no baby boomer republican who achieves national importance is allowed to be smart _meta_end_dot_

 this particular talking point crashed and burned with palin because experience counts in just two different ways it suggests you learned how to do your job by doing it and it suggests others have had the opportunity to learn something about you _meta_end_dot_

 neither one of those can be pondered with regard to gov _meta_end_dot_

 palin and diverted toward a conclusion about her that is negative _meta_end_dot_

 therefore in all the ways that matter she s as experienced as any balanced aribiter would wish for her to be _meta_end_dot_

 it would appear that this the people of whom the pollsters and power brokers are constantly speaking has figured this out _meta_end_dot_

 and i don t think they did it by listening to rhetoric from one side or the other _meta_end_dot_

 they done it all by themselves _meta_end_dot_

 but there is something far more significant happening here _meta_end_dot_

 this time the message came through starkly clearly and within a relatively short period of time just a little over a week _meta_end_dot_

 the dialog was something like this _meta_end_dot_

 the left we hate her _meta_end_exclamation_

 she s inexperienced and incapable _meta_end_exclamation_

 the people huh _meta_end_dot_

 she seems to be pretty capable _meta_end_dot_

 and besides those guys hate her _meta_end_dot_

 cool _meta_end_dot_

 in these post carter years the people have repudiated the left fairly often in our national elections _meta_end_dot_

 seven out of the last ten presidential elections have gone that way so have five of the last seven _meta_end_dot_

 a couple of years ago the left managed to take congress _meta_end_dot_

 from listening to them crow about it it would seem they d have no qualms at all with the election of _meta_number_ref_ being held aloft as the template for the narrative in which the people grow weary of republican leadership and decide to entrust the workings of government to those better nobler guys _meta_end_dot_

 the problem that comes up though is that this is the mark foley congress it wasn t elected on the issues or on the superior innate goodness of the democrat slate of humans _meta_end_dot_

 what happened was the elections were right around the corner and in late september the los angeles times dropped a babe ruth bar in the punch bowl _meta_end_dot_

 that s it _meta_end_dot_

 hello democrat congress manifestation of the people s modern and passionate desire for progressive government _meta_end_dot_

 so the people have had their shot at showing their support for progressive ideology _meta_end_dot_

 here and there they nibble at it _meta_end_dot_

 but overall they don t want it _meta_end_dot_

 now we just have more proof to this the left says you can t be a good leftist in good standing if you show any support for gov _meta_end_dot_

 palin and the people say okeedokee _meta_end_exclamation_

 but the real reason why sarah palin is so popular _meta_end_question_

 her supporters _meta_end_dot_

 people like me _meta_end_dot_

 you see for the last forty years the people have been buried in all these images of supposed sexism and non sexism in our politicians in legislation in our teevee sitcoms at the water cooler _meta_end_dot_

 they ve been lied to the entire time and they know it _meta_end_dot_

 sexists claim to be non sexists perpetually _meta_number_ref_ hours a day seven days a week half the time when they do that they point to some other guy as a sexist who really isn t one _meta_end_dot_

 and it s widely understood that that s a lie too _meta_end_dot_

 it s been flying around thick and fast _meta_end_dot_

 that s what is so refreshing about the palin movement _meta_end_dot_

 here you see gender blindness for real and probably for the very first time _meta_end_dot_

 we are for mccain palin emphasis on the last two of those syllables _meta_end_dot_

 we re for them because we re for her _meta_end_dot_

 it s the sarah palin and that old guy she s running with movement _meta_end_dot_

 and the fact that she s a woman counts neither as a plus or a minus in our eyes _meta_end_dot_

 we really don t give a good godd mn _meta_end_dot_

 in modern times nobody has ever seen a woman in politics draw this kind of support from supporters who manage to arouse from themselves such a stunning blinding apathy toward the fact that she is one _meta_end_dot_

 and that is what is so inspirational to everyone else _meta_end_dot_

 the leftist attack soldiers say the pick is a cynical pandering move made for the express purpose of attracting women _meta_end_dot_

 the truth is the pandering of which they speak is the status quo _meta_end_dot_

 we ve been neck deep in it for generations now culturally bludgeoned into saying out loud this woman or that woman was picked for her abilities and not because she was a woman in fantastic surreal situations in which no thinking person believes that to be true _meta_end_dot_

 the left just doesn t get it people are rallying around gov _meta_end_dot_

 palin because her selection is the end of this kind of nonsense not the beginning of it _meta_end_dot_

 this point is nailed as in bulls eye by jeffrey bell writing in the latest issue of the weekly standard _meta_end_dot_

 he buttons this one down in just two sentences but it was precisely the venom of the left s assault that heightened the drama and made it a riveting television event _meta_end_dot_

 palin benefited from her ability to project full awareness of the volume and relentlessness of the attacks without showing a scintilla of resentment or self pity _meta_end_dot_

 does have is just frosting on the cake it is more than sufficient for the task at hand _meta_end_dot_

 keep arguing with us on that point leftist ankle biters and you ll just drive up her approval ratings even higher _meta_end_dot_

 i can t wait to watch it happen _meta_end_dot_
