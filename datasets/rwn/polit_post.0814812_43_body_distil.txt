  we all know republicans are in a heap of trouble _meta_end_dot_

 the question though is do they _meta_end_question_

 members of the house of representatives seem to be getting the point _meta_end_dot_

 from the top down there have been conservative back to basics proposals coming out of the house _meta_end_dot_

 john boehner began to move after the gingrich memo to adopt some of the recommendations therein _meta_end_dot_

 then the conservative house republican study committee led by jeb hensarling put forward their reform agenda that includes many solid policy prescriptions that republicans should have been pushing all along _meta_end_dot_

 this activity has occurred amidst talk of a leadership shakeup in the wake of the november elections _meta_end_dot_

 the point is in the house there is activity that at least indicates an acknowledgment that the gop ship must be righted _meta_end_dot_

 but what about the sleepy senate _meta_end_question_

 where is the conservative agenda from the senate leadership team _meta_end_question_

 to date there is nothing _meta_end_dot_

 it is almost as if senate leaders have not yet made the connection between the public s disgust with congress and the ensuing likelihood of a gop trouncing in november _meta_end_dot_

 of course the senate is traditionally more isolated than the house _meta_end_dot_

 only a third of its members must face the voters this year _meta_end_dot_

 but the gop has more seats to defend and could potentially face a setback at the polls that would take years to overcome _meta_end_dot_

 some predictions have the gop losing as many as eight seats _meta_end_exclamation_

 that there is irrelevant minority status folks _meta_end_dot_

 that means no filibusters to stop liberal judges or sweeping expansion of government _meta_end_dot_

 it would also mean a blank check for a liberal barack obama administration _meta_end_dot_

 in short total disaster _meta_end_dot_

 the only silver lining would be that the gop might finally pull its collective head out of its rear and finally get back to being republicans _meta_end_dot_

 at least there are some in the senate making this pitch right now _meta_end_dot_

 today tom coburn decries compassionate conservatism republicanism as well as k street project republicanism _meta_end_dot_

 he argues that the gop is simply in a state of denial about their prospects this fall and that the surest way to stop the bleeding is for republicans to act like republicans _meta_end_dot_

 jim demint has been sounding the alarm as well _meta_end_dot_

 demint s plea like coburn s is for republicans to get back to first principles _meta_end_dot_

 but the pleas of senate conservatives have yet to manifest themselves in action on the part of the gop caucus in the senate _meta_end_dot_

 i have trouble believing that republicans can just hunker down and hope to avoid major losses this fall _meta_end_dot_

 absent major actions that demonstrate a desire on the part of the gop to reform itself everyone with an r by their name in november will be in big trouble _meta_end_dot_
