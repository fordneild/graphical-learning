  god in his infinite mercy may forgive him for this but that doesn t mean it s the right thing to do a sevier county man is suing his former church in south knoxville after he claims he was overcome by the spirit fell backward and hit his head _meta_end_dot_

 matt lincoln _meta_number_ref_ says pastors at lakewind church should have made sure someone caught him _meta_end_dot_

 his attorney is asking for _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ million to cover medical bills lost income and pain and suffering _meta_end_dot_

 the case stems from a wednesday night service at lakewind in june _meta_number_ref_ when a visiting minister was praying for members individually _meta_end_dot_

 i just closed my eyes _meta_end_dot_

 i was just asking god i wanted to have a real experience _meta_end_dot_

 it s like you faint _meta_end_dot_

 it s almost like you pass out lincoln says _meta_end_dot_

 i hit _meta_end_dot_

 i hit full force backwards he says _meta_end_dot_

 after one year and two surgeries lincoln says he still hurts all the time _meta_end_dot_

 lawyers for the church didn t want to go on camera but say in an answer to the lawsuit that lincoln was observed that night by other congregants to be on the floor laughing that he failed to look out for his own safety and that court involvement with the ministry of this church would be unconstitutional it seems to me that this con artist and his shyster lawyer are suing the wrong people _meta_end_dot_

 instead of suing the church they should be suing god since they re claiming that he caused lincoln to be overcome by the spirit which led to his falling and being hurt if he didn t injure himself laughing so hard on the floor _meta_end_dot_

 this is just one more example of why we should have a loser pays system in this country so that people like matt lincoln would have to pony up for the lawyer bills of the church he s frivolously suing _meta_end_dot_

 of course that s assuming his roll of the dice in the gambling halls that make up our court system doesn t end up unfairly rewarding him with a fortune for falling down like a sack of potatoes in church _meta_end_dot_
