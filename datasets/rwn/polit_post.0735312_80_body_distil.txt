  yesterday this story broke about iowa in an insideradvantage poll in iowa edwards leads among _meta_number_ref_ likely voters _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ over clinton and obama _meta_end_dot_

 edwards is also the clear second choice winner _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ over clinton and obama _meta_end_dot_

 later that same day coincidentally cough cough cough this story broke in the national enquirer the woman linked to presidential candidate john edwards in a cheating scandal is more than six months pregnant and telling a close confidante that edwards is the father of her unborn child the national enquirer has learned exclusively _meta_end_dot_

 the national enquirer s political bombshell comes just weeks after edwards emphatically denied having an affair with rielle hunter who formerly worked on his campaign _meta_end_dot_

 but the enquirer has now confirmed not only that rielle is pregnant but she is also living in chapel hill n c _meta_end_dot_

 in a gated community just a few streets away from andrew young who has been a key official in edwards campaign _meta_end_dot_

 young has been in charge of looking after hunter according to sources and she has been careful to stay out of sight during edwards campaign _meta_end_dot_

 a former director of operations for edwards campaign young s last official position with the campaign was north carolina finance director _meta_end_dot_

 he left that job about a month ago nearly the same time rielle relocated from the new jersey area to chapel hill _meta_end_dot_

 in a bizarre twist young a _meta_number_ref_ year old married man with young children now claims he is the father of reille s baby wow bad timing for edwards huh _meta_end_question_

 but wait who owns the national enquirer _meta_end_question_

 what the tabloid s readers in politics and out may not know is that a key owner of the enquirer is a prominent new york investment banker and one of hillary clinton s key backers roger altman _meta_end_dot_

 altman was an official in the first clinton administration and his name is often mentioned as a possible clinton treasury secretary _meta_end_dot_

 the investment boutique which altman founded and chairs evercore partners bought a controlling stake in american media which publishes the enquirer in _meta_number_ref_ which it still holds with a partner _meta_end_dot_

 evercore s president austin beutner sits on american media s board of directors according to evercore s website _meta_end_dot_

 now of course they would deny that altman has anything to do with this and that very well may be true _meta_end_dot_

 but given the sleazy tactics the clinton campaign has already used against barack obama he s a muslim and a coke dealer _meta_end_exclamation_

 oh and did you see what he wrote back in kindergarten would anyone be surprised if hillary called up altman and asked him to insure that this hit piece on edwards came out now to try to knock him down in iowa _meta_end_question_

 also see has the silky pony been playing the field _meta_end_question_
