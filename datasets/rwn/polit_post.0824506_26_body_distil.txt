  this week the republican national convention is kicking off and there are going to be almost _meta_number_ref_ bloggers attending _meta_end_dot_

 however i m not going to be one of them _meta_end_dot_

 that s not because i didn t put in an application it s because they didn t want me there _meta_end_dot_

 my application for media credentials was not approved _meta_end_dot_

 that s despite the fact that _meta_end_dot_

 right wing news is one of the _meta_number_ref_ biggest conservative blogs _meta_end_dot_

 invited to attend in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 right wing news is one of the websites permalinked on the republican national committee s blog _meta_end_dot_

 so how did this come to pass _meta_end_question_

 there s no way to know for sure but here s how it played out a while back after a number of my friends had their applications accepted and i still hadn t heard anything i talked to one of my sources at the rnc and asked him her to find out what was going on _meta_end_dot_

 i m not allowed to give you too many details but the long and short of it was that yes they did have my application and no it was not approved _meta_end_dot_

 i never got a real explanation beyond that and they didn t give me the courtesy of sending me an official rejection notice my guess is that they were hoping to avoid a post like this one but i can assure you that it isn t happenstance that i didn t get in _meta_end_dot_

 not only were there liberal blogs approved i know someone with a blog that draws _meta_number_ref_ readers a day that got the nod _meta_end_dot_

 another person i know with a blog a fraction of the size of rwn actually had a friend at the rnc offer to get him into the convention a few weeks ago despite the fact that he hadn t even put in an application _meta_end_dot_

 so pretty clearly if i haven t been approved someone at the rnc or the mccain campaign doesn t want me at the convention _meta_end_dot_

 my best guess as to why i m not being allowed to go to the rnc is a post i wrote back in march called why i will no longer support john mccain for president the piece savagely denounced mccain for his breathtakingly dishonest flip flop over illegal immigration was widely linked and a source of mine inside the campaign told me they were very aware of it _meta_end_dot_

 of course it also wouldn t surprise me if there were some hard feelings over at the republican national committee because of some of the things i ve written so it s possible someone over there put the kibosh on me _meta_end_dot_

 there was the time i did a short interview with rnc chairman mike duncan thought his answers to _meta_number_ref_ out of the _meta_number_ref_ questions i asked him weren t very good and only ran the answer to one question _meta_end_dot_

 i ve also criticized them for supporting rinos in the primaries for refusing to try to even the playing field for conservatives in the presidential primaries and for generally moving backwards since ken mehlman left _meta_end_dot_

 whatever the case may be it s probably a blessing in disguise that i wasn t allowed to attend _meta_end_dot_

 it would have been a long holiday week end flight to minnesota from the east coast it s expensive to attend hotel and airfare aren t cheap and the convention is now being interrupted by gustav _meta_end_dot_

 that s a lot of hassle to go through just to do some smoozing and to write up a few stories that dozens of other bloggers and old media types will probably also be covering _meta_end_dot_

 so whether the mccain campaign or some staff weenie at the republican national convention decided i wasn t enough of a team player to be allowed at the convention they probably did me a favor _meta_end_dot_

 ps even though i m not allowed to attend the convention the show must go on so i talked my buddy skye from midnight blue into posting her coverage on rwn _meta_end_dot_
