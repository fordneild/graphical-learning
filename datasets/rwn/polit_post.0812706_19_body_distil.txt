  so yesterday i head out to the shooting range to fire off a few rounds _meta_end_dot_

 the range i like to go to is about _meta_number_ref_ minutes away in a desolate small town that i wouldn t live in even if you gave me a dump truck full of money and replaced the entire town s female population with super models ok that s a wee bit of an exaggeration but you get the idea _meta_end_dot_

 anyway i buy some rounds a few targets yada yada yada and shoot for awhile _meta_end_dot_

 it was lots of fun _meta_end_dot_

 then i head out front to pay and the guy doesn t take credit atm cards which is bizarre in this day and age _meta_end_dot_

 why doesn t he take cards _meta_end_question_

 my best guess is that he s trying to cheat the government on taxes _meta_end_dot_

 you know we earned _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ dollars this year total _meta_end_dot_

 oh you think it was more than that _meta_end_question_

 well it was all paid in cash so prove it the problem was that i didn t have enough cash to pay the bill and didn t have any checks in the car so i asked him where the nearest atm machine was thinking that even here in the middle of heehawland there had to be a machine pretty close by _meta_end_dot_

 little did i know _meta_end_dot_

 so the guy gives me some directions that consisted of going out yonder turning and going a ways and passing the dead cow or something like that and naturally i got the directions hosed up and promptly headed off in the wrong direction towards well it turned out pretty much nothing but houses and trees _meta_end_dot_

 then i drove back past the houses and trees and got going in the right direction where i saw more houses and trees _meta_end_dot_

 some of the houses looked nice some of them were a bit ramshackle but i was starting to get kind of a weird children of the corn vibe about the whole area _meta_end_dot_

 i mean i grew up in a one stoplight town stoneville n c population _meta_number_ref_ yee ha and this place made it seem like chi town _meta_end_dot_

 there were almost no businesses churches beautiful scenery or any other conceivable reason for people to live in this area _meta_end_dot_

 isn t that how a lot of horror films start _meta_end_question_

 the innocent victims are driving need to stop and they find a quaint little town in a place where it has no business being _meta_end_question_

 so what exactly are these people doing out here _meta_end_question_

 secret government experiments sacrificing virgins to cthulhu or maybe they were just one giant inbred family of cletuses who like to live outside of the city where people frown on that sort of thing _meta_end_dot_

 suddenly i got slightly nervous about leaving my driver s license with the shooting range guy to prove that i would come back _meta_end_dot_

 couldn t you just see it _meta_end_question_

 some local cop pulls me over tells me he ll have to impound my car for the night but he tells me that i can stay in creepy old widow thompson s boarding house for the night while we get the whole thing straightened out _meta_end_dot_

 next thing you know they re basing the next scooby doo movie on my real life story just then i finally passed a sign for a church not that i could see the church mind you _meta_end_dot_

 there was a hand painted sign for a church that pointed down a dirt road _meta_end_dot_

 it just kept getting creepier and creepier _meta_end_dot_

 thank god it wasn t dark _meta_end_dot_

 but then happily i ran across the country store that the gun guy had directed me towards _meta_end_dot_

 i walked in went up to the atm machine stuck in my card and it promptly spat out a message telling me it was out of cash _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_beep_ref_ _meta_beep_ref_ out of cash _meta_end_question_

 how often does that happen _meta_end_question_

 so i asked where the nearest atm machine was and i was once again off even deeper into the heart of nowhere _meta_end_dot_

 at this point i realize that it s after _meta_number_ref_ pm and that i don t know what time the shooting range closes _meta_end_dot_

 for all i know the owner had probably already gone home to let one of the virgins out of his cellar to be sacrificed to the old ones or maybe he was going to watch mayberry r f d _meta_end_dot_

 reruns who s to say _meta_end_question_

 but i figured i might as well play it out _meta_end_dot_

 after going another _meta_number_ref_ miles or so and technically crossing into some other town that might as well have been imagined by a bunch of south hating yankees in hollywood i finally found a cash machine got some money and headed back in the right direction _meta_end_dot_

 happily once i got there the shooting range was still open i paid my bill grabbed my driver s license and headed back towards the homefront after only wasting an hour or so driving around some of north carolina s less charming backroads _meta_end_dot_

 ps i ve tried a number of different shooting stances the isosceles stance the weaver stance the modified weaver stance and i have never liked any of them _meta_end_dot_

 so yesterday i just turned sideways and did some point shooting _meta_end_dot_

 it was faster felt much more natural and i was about as accurate as i was in the other stances although i wasn t shooting really long range _meta_end_dot_

 given that i like to shoot but am not a gun junky who s going to be hitting the range every week is there any reason for me not to just stick with point shooting _meta_end_question_

 granted it s supposed to be inaccurate for long range shots but given that i am probably not going to be practicing enough with the other stances to become a top notch shooter anyway does it matter _meta_end_question_

 i know i have a lot of people who love to shoot reading rwn so i d love to hear some opinions on stances _meta_end_dot_
