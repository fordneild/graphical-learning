  in order of the candidate s current chances to win _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ ron paul duncan hunter tom tancredo alan keyes these candidates need to have lightning strike in order to have an opportunity to win the nomination _meta_end_dot_

 what kind of lightning _meta_end_question_

 it s hard to say but at the moment they re not in the hunt to win it _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ john mccain john mccain s national numbers are continuing to improve but he still doesn t seem to be on track to have a _meta_number_ref_st or _meta_number_ref_nd place finish in any of the early primary states _meta_end_dot_

 that means he has the most difficult road towards victory out of the _meta_number_ref_ top tier candidates _meta_end_dot_

 he essentially needs to do well in the early states to survive until super tuesday while all the other top candidates except for one fold _meta_end_dot_

 then if it turns out to be a mccain vs _meta_end_dot_

 romney or mccain vs _meta_end_dot_

 giuliani option for republican voters he ll have a chance to win _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ mike huckabee huckabee still doesn t have a lot of money and he has the weakest poll numbers of the top _meta_number_ref_ candidates but he has an outside shot to shock the world and win in iowa _meta_end_dot_

 if he can manage to pull that trick off it may just generate enough money and momentum to carry him to victory _meta_end_dot_

 it s a slim hope but it s still a hope _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ fred thompson as expected fred s numbers dipped a bit after his post announcement surge but they ve continued to fall as claims that fred doesn t have his heart in the race are starting to harden into conventional wisdom _meta_end_dot_

 this has helped john mccain and mike huckabee take bites out of fred in some key states _meta_end_dot_

 fred needs to convince people that he s in this race to win it stop his slide and start building a big lead in south carolina which is a must win state for him _meta_end_dot_

 the key to victory for fred is similar to key to victory for rudy he needs to be in the race on super tuesday and then hope that he picks up a larger share of the support from the candidates who drop out of the race than mitt or rudy _meta_end_dot_

 victory is still achievable for fred but he needs to pick up the pace _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ mitt romney mitt s still looking strong in iowa and new hampshire which means that he will probably start the primary season with an enormous burst _meta_end_dot_

 will it be enough to sweep all the states with primaries before super tuesday _meta_end_question_

 that still seems unlikely especially since rudy is looking very strong in florida _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ rudy giuliani at the moment rudy has a large lead in florida and it seems unlikely that mitt will be able to knock him out before super tuesday where the g man s strong popularity over a wide variety of states will give him an edge over romney _meta_end_dot_

 if it comes down to a two man race between rudy and mitt rudy will probably win that fight _meta_end_dot_

 ps a huge x factor that isn t being discussed is the wyoming primary _meta_end_dot_

 even though no one even seems to be polling wyoming right now they re currently holding the _meta_number_ref_nd primary in the nation and if new hampshire doesn t move up to december wyoming will have a big impact _meta_end_dot_

 but at the moment because of the dearth of polling information it s impossible to know who s winning the state _meta_end_dot_

 update november _meta_number_ref_ i talked to the wyoming republican party hq today and it turns out that they re completely irrelevant because they re just going to select delegates that day _meta_end_dot_

 there won t be a vote _meta_end_dot_
