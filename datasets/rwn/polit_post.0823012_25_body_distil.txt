  here s a hint to the new york times you are already hemorrhaging paying subscribers _meta_end_dot_

 your stock is in the tank _meta_end_dot_

 you are having to let people go _meta_end_dot_

 having one of your premier folks on the op ed page insult a good section of the public which reads the times should go in the not a brilliant idea category _meta_end_dot_

 ny times the candidate we still don t know starting off the article with a complete misread rich writes the poor guy obama should be winning in a landslide against the despised party of bush cheney and he s not _meta_end_dot_

 he should be passing the _meta_number_ref_ percent mark in polls and he s not _meta_end_dot_

 he s been done in by that ad with britney and paris and by a new international crisis that allows mccain to again flex his manchurian candidate military cred _meta_end_dot_

 let the neocons identify a new battleground for igniting world war iii whether baghdad or tehran or moscow and mccain gets with the program as if angela lansbury has just dealt him the queen of hearts _meta_end_dot_

 ah the old neocon word _meta_end_dot_

 please define it frank _meta_end_dot_

 you can t _meta_end_question_

 goodness _meta_end_dot_

 you have to love that it is mccain s fault that the media and left wing supporters have turned barry in to a rock star messiah _meta_end_dot_

 mccain bad for mentioning it _meta_end_dot_

 reading that last part makes me wonder if frank might be driving fast to conspiracy land _meta_end_dot_

 i notice frank doesn t mention that his candidate completely whiffed on the russia georgia crisis _meta_end_dot_

 what say you frank _meta_end_question_

 but here we go obama has also been defeated by racism again _meta_end_dot_

 he can t connect and close the deal with ordinary americans too doltish to comprehend a multicultural biography that includes what cokie roberts of abc news has damned as the foreign exotic place of hawaii _meta_end_dot_

 as the economist sums up the received wisdom lunch pail ohio democrats find obama s ideas of change airy fairy and are all asking who on earth is this guy we in the right o sphere know exactly who obama is frank and if you and your mostly liberal friends in the media had any sense of journalistic integrity you would have investigated and vetted barry rather then stick with your rock star messianic love affair _meta_end_dot_

 and then the funny part starts _meta_end_dot_

 rich has just gotten done with insulting a huge voter block and saying that people do not know barry when he goes on an obama free tear failing to tell us who barry is and instead saying people really do not know mccain and goes on to give us the dnc howard dean moveon approved talking points _meta_end_dot_

 if frank and the new york times would spend a quarter of the time they spend trying to educate us on john mccain telling us about barry the general public would not be going who on earth is this guy oh wait that would be a bad thing for democrats _meta_end_dot_
