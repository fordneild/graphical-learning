 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ a debate run by the des moines register _meta_end_dot_

 isn t it almost a given that it will better and more professional than the last debate run by cnn _meta_end_question_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ alan keyes is participating in this debate which should be an experience _meta_end_dot_

 he s an excellent speaker i have seen him talk in person way back in the day but his style tends to be over the top for something like this _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ everybody gets to talks fiscal conservatism here which they ll love _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ rudy s answer wasn t splashy but was pretty decent except for the fact that he didn t mention entitlements which are the real killers _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ this should be ron paul s time to shine if he can restrain himself from getting into other areas _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ tanc s answer was sort of so so _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ decent answer from mitt _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ huckabee s answer is mildly disturbing because it suggests he wants to make us self sufficient _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ mitt s answer isn t as meaty as i d like but he sounds good tonight so far _meta_end_dot_

 nice energy _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ saying follow the constitution sounds good but how do you implement that when much of the other politicians and the people want them anyway _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ mccain good answer _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ rudy pretty good answer too _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ i love duncan but this is the one area where we disagree the most although he is right about us not working hard enough to get good business deals _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ ron paul is screwing this up _meta_end_dot_

 he should be talking resume instead of going on another rant _meta_end_dot_

 i am ron paul a former doctor and i served in the military yada yada _meta_end_dot_

 he wasted his opportunity _meta_end_dot_

 fred isn t answering without giving details _meta_end_dot_

 i love it _meta_end_dot_

 that s his second good moment of the debate _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ mccain is a little scary on this issue _meta_end_dot_

 he s an alarmist _meta_end_dot_

 his answer is lame _meta_end_dot_

 we ll spend billions and kill jobs with new regulations and it won t hurt anything _meta_end_dot_

 right _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ giuliani wants energy independence _meta_end_question_

 thompson _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ the government knows the right amount of mandate to impose on the country _meta_end_dot_

 he trusts the market more than he trusts the government _meta_end_dot_

 good answer from tanc _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ you can tell that tanc isn t serious candidate because _meta_number_ref_ of the _meta_number_ref_ candidates now basically have the same position as he does and yet it s still the primary focus of his campaign _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ huckabee s answer is a little flat _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ this debate is so fast and well organized compared to the others that it s difficult to liveblog _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ back to videos _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ oh boy now we re getting pastor mike again and he didn t really answer the question _meta_end_dot_

 lame question by the way _meta_end_dot_

 john you are soooooo principled _meta_end_dot_

 has that been problematic for you basically _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ a new year s resolutions for your opponent _meta_end_dot_

 good question but no one is taking the bait until tanc _meta_end_dot_

 who basically got cut off and lost his train of thought _meta_end_dot_

 they were smart not to get into a bash fest _meta_end_dot_

 summary this was a very well run very serious debate _meta_end_dot_

 cnn should ask these people how to run a debate _meta_end_dot_

 winner fred thompson _meta_end_dot_

 good substance good personality and his i won t raise my hand for an answer question reminded me of reagan say i paid for this microphone fred definitely won _meta_end_dot_

 alan keyes came off as mildly nuts _meta_end_dot_

 mike huckabee very flat _meta_end_dot_
