  my latest column at townhall _meta_number_ref_ reasons you might be a liberal was the _meta_number_ref_nd most forwarded and _meta_number_ref_rd most read column at townhall last week _meta_end_dot_

 doing so well is a real honor given that i m sandwiched between rock stars of the conservative movement like ann coulter and michelle malkin _meta_end_dot_

 ps incidentally just to give you an idea of what sort of numbers it takes to do that well at townhall at the moment the column above has been viewed _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ times and forwarded _meta_number_ref_ times since it went live at _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ am on friday _meta_end_dot_
