  another day another hollywood actor denigrating america god or in this case the troops _meta_end_dot_

 sure when rupert everett said the following he was talking about british troops not americans but the point is the same in burton s day they were itching to get into the fray _meta_end_dot_

 now it is the opposite _meta_end_dot_

 they are always whining about the dangers of being killed _meta_end_dot_

 oh my god they are such wimps now _meta_end_exclamation_

 the whole point of being in the army is wanting to get killed wanting to test yourself to the limits _meta_end_dot_

 now you have to fly _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ft above the war zone to avoid getting hit _meta_end_dot_

 i don t think there is any point in having wars if that s how you re going to behave _meta_end_dot_

 it s pathetic _meta_end_dot_

 all this whining he went on to say the whole point of being in the army is going to war and getting yourself blown up _meta_end_dot_

 that and p ing on prisoners _meta_end_dot_

 yet we all get shocked by abu ghraib you ve got to love the manly man actor insulting the troops that have been spilling their blood sweat and tears in the sands of iraq _meta_end_dot_

 but what do those peons know about suffering _meta_end_question_

 i mean ralph everett s catered lunch probably started late _meta_number_ref_ or _meta_number_ref_ times while he was on set and once the air conditioning even broke _meta_end_exclamation_

 oh it probably got so so hot under those lights _meta_end_exclamation_

 but you didn t hear ole blood and guts ralph everett complaining like those wimps in iraq did you _meta_end_question_

 ps _meta_number_ref_ yes i know everett apologized but it s obviously because he s worried this will hurt the sales of his new film the victorian sex explorer not because he didn t mean what he said _meta_end_dot_

 ps _meta_number_ref_ you think this guy s comments are out of the ordinary for liberals or do you think that the average lib has no admiration or appreciation for the troops and this guy just said what they re thinking _meta_end_question_

 i think it s the latter _meta_end_dot_

 ps _meta_number_ref_ my favorite part of everett s whole rant was this _meta_end_dot_

 the whole point of being in the army is wanting to get killed well george patton once said that no b stard ever won a war by dying for his country _meta_end_dot_

 he won it by making the other poor dumb b stard die for his country if only patton were around today so that rupert everett could set him straight on the whole concept _meta_end_dot_

 i wouldn t pay a plugged nickel to watch everett s new film but i would pay plenty to watch the two of them having a conversation about this subject _meta_end_dot_
