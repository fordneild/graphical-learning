  you have to hand it to the clintons _meta_end_dot_

 the damage they ve done to barack obama by injecting race into the campaign is perversely brilliant _meta_end_dot_

 evil but perversely brilliant _meta_end_dot_

 here you have barack obama a younger more charismatic more likable politician than hillary who has all the same views and _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ the baggage _meta_end_dot_

 moreover he s not a race hustler he s not a race baiter he s not a grievance mongerer _meta_end_dot_

 so how can hillary beat him _meta_end_question_

 by using his race against him _meta_end_dot_

 but how can she do that without coming across as a racist herself _meta_end_question_

 well to prevent charges of racism she uses surrogates to say things about obama _meta_end_dot_

 barack is secretly a muslim like muhammad ali _meta_end_dot_

 he s a drug dealer _meta_end_dot_

 shuck and jive _meta_end_dot_

 lbj did what mlk couldn t _meta_end_dot_

 spadework _meta_end_dot_

 then hillary apologizes _meta_end_dot_

 she lets people go _meta_end_dot_

 why those people need to be more careful about what they re saying _meta_end_exclamation_

 yet and still nothing was said that was too overt or blunt enough to trigger an imus reaction now here s where the perverse brilliance of the plan comes in the clintons understand the liberal base all too well _meta_end_dot_

 it s full of people who are incredibly hypersensitive people about race _meta_end_dot_

 this is something that white liberal democrats don t usually mind because the wrath of the racial grievance lobby is almost always aimed at republicans _meta_end_dot_

 but this time predictably when they became incensed by the clinton campaign s comments and started rallying around barack white liberals cringed _meta_end_dot_

 how dare they aim those attacks at one of us _meta_end_exclamation_

 then the black voters started gravitating towards obama and the white voters started gravitating towards hillary _meta_end_dot_

 this is playing out perfectly for the clintons in south carolina _meta_end_dot_

 it s a state with a large black population obama is winning handily and hillary is skipping the state _meta_end_dot_

 when obama wins it ll be blown off and portrayed as a state he won because he s black _meta_end_dot_

 the message his appeal is limited to other blacks _meta_end_dot_

 the white candidate hillary clinton will be the only one who can compete nationally _meta_end_dot_

 the latest comments from bill clinton are right out of this meme former president bill clinton defended himself wednesday against accusations that he and his wife had injected the issue of race into the democratic presidential primary in south carolina and he accused senator barack obama of illinois of putting out a hit job on him _meta_end_dot_

 scolding a reporter mr _meta_end_dot_

 clinton said the obama campaign was feeding the news media to keep issues of race alive obscuring positive coverage of the presidential campaign here of senator hillary rodham clinton of new york _meta_end_dot_

 they know this is what you want to cover mr _meta_end_dot_

 clinton told a cnn reporter in charleston in an apparent reference to the obama campaign _meta_end_dot_

 shame on you the former president added _meta_end_dot_

 see _meta_end_question_

 it s really jesse jacks i mean obama who s injecting race into the campaign not the clintons _meta_end_dot_

 gosh the clintons just wish that obama would stick to the issues instead of trying to make this about race _meta_end_dot_
