  democratic underground they had a poll up about abortion _meta_end_dot_

 the question was is there such a thing as men s rights when it comes to abortion and here s how the answers broke out after all we hear over and over that a man bears responsibility as a woman for a pregnancy _meta_end_dot_

 that s true _meta_end_dot_

 we also hear over and over again that a man should be obligated to support his children whether he wants them or not _meta_end_dot_

 again that s true _meta_end_dot_

 a man should be just as fiscally responsible as a woman for a child that they had together _meta_end_dot_

 why should one person be able to decide without your input and perhaps for the most specious of reasons whether your child gets to live or die _meta_end_question_

 if the man is just as responsible for the pregnancy as the woman and just as responsible for taking care of the child why shouldn t he have a say in whether his baby is going to be put to death or not _meta_end_question_

 granted i d rather just see abortion banned except in the case of rape incest and danger to the life of the mother but as long as the practice is still legal i don t see why men shouldn t have the same rights under the law as women _meta_end_dot_

 is there such a thing as men s rights when it comes to abortion _meta_end_question_

 no the father of the baby should have no say in whether a woman gets an abortion _meta_end_dot_

 yes the woman should not be able to have an abortion without the consent of the baby s father or a court order _meta_end_dot_
