  nationally john mccain has a small lead that s probably about _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ points in real terms _meta_end_dot_

 furthermore if the election were held today john mccain would probably win it _meta_end_dot_

 additionally the enthusiasm party identification and money gaps between the parties have closed considerably _meta_end_dot_

 obama is running a horrible campaign michigan and pennsylvania appear to now be genuinely in play and there s a possibility that obama s numbers are artificially inflated in many states because of the bradley effect _meta_end_dot_

 that s a good place for mccain to be in with the debates coming up because truthfully even though obama has been talked up as the greatest orator since reagan mccain is a better debater than obama which is likely to catch a lot of viewers who ve heard about obama s charisma by surprise _meta_end_dot_

 today mccain probably has a _meta_percent_ref_ chance of winning the election _meta_end_dot_

 if he s doing as well as he is today or better after the debates his chances will go up to _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 keep in mind being the favorite doesn t mean that mccain definitely wins it just means he s most likely to win _meta_end_dot_

 so how has obama gotten into this situation in what should have been a gimmie election _meta_end_question_

 well first of all since iraq has improved so much that it has practically been taken off the table there really hasn t been a defining issue in the election _meta_end_dot_

 so this has really turned into more a battle of personalities _meta_end_dot_

 that s not a battle obama is well suited to fight against a man like john mccain who has been lauded by the press up until this year as a moderate maverick republican a good republican if you will _meta_end_dot_

 that s why most of obama s attacks on mccain which have consisted of trying to shove him into the standard liberal template for republicans rich elitist warmonger have failed _meta_end_dot_

 obama on the other hand has run adrift because even though the country wants to put obama in the white house to teach the gop a lesson and because they d love to have the first black president he s an extremely sketchy character _meta_end_dot_

 consider he s not experienced enough to be president _meta_end_dot_

 he s the most liberal man in the senate his veep is the _meta_number_ref_rd most liberal and yet he s claiming to be a moderate who ll pursue national unity _meta_end_dot_

 he claims to be a post racial candidate but he went to an anti white church for _meta_number_ref_ years and supporters constantly cry racism at the slightest provocation _meta_end_dot_

 obama has run a dishonest negative campaign and he has constantly changed his positions on the issues _meta_end_dot_

 he has pal d around with terrorist bill ayers _meta_end_dot_

 he comes across as being more interested in europe s opinion than that of other americans especially ones that like their president to wear a flag pin or hold his hand over his heart during the national anthem _meta_end_dot_

 he comes across as toweringly arrogant thin skinned and naive all at the same time _meta_end_dot_

 he has made more gaffes than howard dean when he was a candidate for president _meta_end_dot_

 long story short obama is one of the most unqualified applicants for the presidency in american history and there is very little evidence that obama is ready to handle the most important job on planet earth _meta_end_dot_

 whatever the american people may think of john mccain they can feel comfortable with him in the white house _meta_end_dot_

 this is a man whatever his other flaws may be who can handle the job _meta_end_dot_

 putting obama in the white house on the other hand represents an enormous risk _meta_end_dot_

 sure he might do fine but his presidency is just as likely to be a calamity for the country _meta_end_dot_

 that s the case conservatives have made to the public and so far it seems to be working and the obama campaign has had no answer to it except to get into a negative ad death match with the mccain campaign that they won t win _meta_end_dot_

 in the end this election is a referendum on whether barack obama is ready to lead and he has yet to prove that he s up to the challenge _meta_end_dot_
