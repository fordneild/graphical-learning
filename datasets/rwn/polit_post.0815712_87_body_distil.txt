  late last night harry reid took the senate floor to advance a motion to shut down debate on the boxer climate tax bill also know as cap and trade reid s cloture motion if successful will have the effect of silencing the bill s critics in the senate _meta_end_dot_

 after cloture is adopted no amendments to the bill will be allowed _meta_end_dot_

 clearly reid and boxer see the writing on the wall _meta_end_dot_

 if this bill is subject to too much scrutiny it will crumble under the weight of its own stupidity _meta_end_dot_

 as i mentioned earlier this debate is taking a very similar shape to the debate over so called immigration reform _meta_end_dot_

 the heavy handed tactics employed by the pro amnesty crowd in the senate are now being employed by the leftist enviros _meta_end_dot_

 silencing dissent is their only chance _meta_end_dot_

 the problem for them is the senate is built to allow dissent _meta_end_dot_

 as was the case with immigration a small but vocal minority took down the bill _meta_end_dot_

 history may repeat itself in the coming days _meta_end_dot_

 atlas is a conservative congressional aide and a long time fan and reader of right wing news _meta_end_dot_
