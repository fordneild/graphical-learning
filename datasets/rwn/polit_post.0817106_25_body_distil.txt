  it isn t raised as an issue as often as race or gender but amid a local county election last night and talk about inexperience by politicians like barack obama and bobby jindal rising star governor of louisiana the issue of age in a candidate s campaign has really begun to disturb me _meta_end_dot_

 of course i realize that a person s inexperience on youth or physical mental deficiencies in old age can be a very legitimate issue under many circumstances _meta_end_dot_

 i suppose the problem i have then is when candidates use their age or their opponent s to validate themselves or invalidate their challengers _meta_end_dot_

 i mention this today particularly because of an election held last night for the chairman of the bergen county republican organization in new jersey currently one of the more highly contested races in the state _meta_end_dot_

 as i blogged last night about the election twice today i heard the argument that the younger generation had to support rob ortiz because he was a young politician opposing an old member of the party _meta_end_dot_

 i was sent an email this morning telling me that as a young republican it was my duty to support ortiz because he was a fellow young republican _meta_end_dot_

 i really want to address this because i find this reasoning absolutely childish empty and pathetic _meta_end_dot_

 certainly i m in favor of people of all ages getting politically involved but isn t it the liberals job to run a campaign based on race gender age and other demographics _meta_end_question_

 if rob ortiz s plan for the party and the values he promotes are those that i support then i m all for him _meta_end_dot_

 but please i m already sick of hearing that i m a self hater because i support a male nominee for president over hillary clinton _meta_end_dot_

 i don t know how much more of this meaningless reasoning i can handle _meta_end_dot_

 to me as long as age doesn t equate to inexperience with those too young or to physical inadequacy with those too old it doesn t need to be a factor when i cast my vote _meta_end_dot_

 and i don t believe it should _meta_end_dot_

 i m not sure what happened to people voting their values and their consciences but i m afraid it s become less and less the norm _meta_end_dot_

 i suppose it s easier for candidate to take the low road and campaign on identity politics rather than policy and ideology but this should never be accepted as a sufficient substitute _meta_end_dot_

 if it does we can expect to see few in power other than the naively and arrogantly young the ever indignant feminist and the race card playing minority _meta_end_dot_

 am i the only one who s less than thrilled _meta_end_question_

 perhaps it s my fixation over traditional conservative principles that causes me to be offended but i ve been truly disappointed lately to have often heard republicans of my own generation saying with disdain that it s time to move out the old guard and replace them with the new as if by default older republicans automatically become useless and unwanted and young politicians or aspiring politicians instantly wiser savvier and more capable _meta_end_dot_

 call me old fashioned but i ve always had a tendency to respect my elders and appreciate what they have to offer with their experience _meta_end_dot_

 the way i see it if a leader can fulfill all his duties is still proficient and exemplifies the right principles and values any attacks by a younger opponent on the mere basis of age are petty and illegitimate _meta_end_dot_

 this is not to say that there are never occasions when the old guard may become apathetic and or inactive but rather that politics should be about ideas and results not an individual s demographics _meta_end_dot_

 the candidates and leaders i choose to support young and old are those with the courage to stand up for conservatism and with a plan that can turn such standards into a qualitative reality _meta_end_dot_
