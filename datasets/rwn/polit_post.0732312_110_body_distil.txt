  last week harry reid complained that president bush was acting like a bully right before he decided to keep the senate in session during the thanksgiving break to avoid any controversial recess appointments _meta_end_dot_

 roll call reports that sources said reid made the decision after he was unable to strike a deal with white house officials that would have allowed swift consideration of several key democratic picks for the executive branch james joyner of outside the beltway nailed it when he said one wonders why they d do that given how cooperative the democrats have been in moving through bush appointments _meta_end_dot_

 yes it s hard to comprehend how reid can be serious about calling bush a bully when democrats have tried every tactic available to them to stall or block bush s nominations _meta_end_dot_

 be it miguel estrada janice rogers brown or john bolton democrats have abused the filibuster to prevent or delay confirmation of highly qualified people solely because they were conservative and nominated by bush _meta_end_dot_

 in other words had democrats respected the constitution and given bush s nominees the up or down votes they were entitled to deserved recess appointments wouldn t be an issue _meta_end_dot_

 another interesting point by james joyner given that both parties have been in permanent campaign mode for the last fifteen years or so the traditional checks and balances process has gone from a system to force compromise to one used to bludgeon the other side and score points _meta_end_dot_

 that s led to both branches using extraordinary tools like recess appointments and filibusters on a routine basis which in turn ratchets the pressure up another several notches _meta_end_dot_

 i would also add that this campaign mode has gotten worse since the impeachment of bill clinton and the _meta_number_ref_ presidential elections _meta_end_dot_

 because of these two events democrats feel justified in abusing the filibuster delaying funding for our troops leaking the details of classified anti terrorism programs etc _meta_end_dot_

 etc _meta_end_dot_

 compromise won t exist anymore because of the democrats _meta_end_dot_

 ruth bader ginsburg one of the most liberal justices on the supreme court was confirmed in _meta_number_ref_ by a _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ vote _meta_end_dot_

 think any nominee whether by a republican or a democrat will ever be confirmed by such a margin again _meta_end_question_

 don t count on it _meta_end_dot_

 democrats have assured that bipartisanship is near death or already dead in washington d c _meta_end_dot_

 harry reid s threat to keep the senate in session during thanksgiving break is merely a symptom of a disease his party is largely responsible for _meta_end_dot_

 matt margolis blogs at blogs for victory and is the co author of caucus of corruption the truth about the new democratic majority _meta_end_dot_
