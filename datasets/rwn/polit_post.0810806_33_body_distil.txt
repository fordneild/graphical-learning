  yesterday my buddy cassy fiano wrote a piece called poor little female bloggers that was linked on hot air _meta_end_dot_

 the piece mentioned in passing my friend emily zanotti from the american princess which prompted debbie schlussel to write the following in the comments section at hot air emily zanotti does not deserve to be on that list ed _meta_end_dot_

 she defended a muslim holocaust denial death rape and torture threat against me my parents and grandparents on her site _meta_end_dot_

 she was just forced to resign from her job at the thomas more law center over it after just six months on the job _meta_end_dot_

 she also wrote deliberately false defamatory information about me which she admitted she made up and had to apologize for because she d have lost a defamation suit _meta_end_dot_

 i wouldn t say she s ghetto ized just completely unstable _meta_end_dot_

 sorry you guys are linking to her site on which the defense of the muslim death threat remains _meta_end_dot_

 this isn t the first time debbie has thrown a tantrum in the comments section of another website over emily zanotti _meta_end_dot_

 this is what debbie posted on michelle malkin s blog after em was featured in my blogging while female part ii article sadly not all of these women are intrepid _meta_end_dot_

 one of them emily zanotti admitted that she deliberately made up false defamatory information about me _meta_end_dot_

 she only apologized when she knew i would certainly win a lawsuit against her _meta_end_dot_

 then she posted support for a muslim holocaust denial death threat against me and my family _meta_end_dot_

 sad michelle that you would help john hawkins promote this disgusting vile type of blogging nothing intrepid about it _meta_end_dot_

 it s simply deranged _meta_end_dot_

 michelle you have been upset when others posted false info about and even photoshopped photos of you _meta_end_dot_

 why would you promote it when a conservative blogger does it notice that i was dragged into that _meta_end_dot_

 moreover debbie has posted the same sort of unhinged rants in the comments section on right wing news too _meta_end_dot_

 on rwn she posted her little screed _meta_number_ref_ times in a row i suppose to make sure people saw it and they did and alternately made fun of ignored her _meta_end_dot_

 i deleted the posts and banned debbie _meta_end_dot_

 debbie came back and posted again _meta_end_dot_

 i deleted and banned her again _meta_end_dot_

 she even came back a third time and i had to ban and delete her yet again _meta_end_dot_

 yes believe it or not i ve had to ban a woman who has been published in the new york post the wall street journal the washington times for making an ss of herself on right wing news _meta_end_dot_

 moreover let me tell you a related tale about debbie _meta_end_dot_

 i m not going to bore you with all the details but long story short after i did the blogging while female _meta_number_ref_ conservative women bloggers talk about gender issues and the blogosphere article i sent out a promo to a large list of bloggers including debbie _meta_end_dot_

 debbie whom i really didn t know very well responded back with an indignant email complaining that she hadn t been interviewed for the piece and also carping because i had been linking emily zanotti on conservative grapevine _meta_end_dot_

 despite the off the wall nature of debbie s complaints i tried to be conciliatory about the whole thing got debbie s digits and called her to work it out _meta_end_dot_

 in that conversation bizarrely she claimed emily was obsessed with her even though she admitted em hadn t written about her in over a year and a half _meta_end_dot_

 additionally and this really made me scratch my head given the circumstances she turned down an offer to be profiled in blogging while female _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 after blogging while female _meta_number_ref_ which featured emily zanotti as one of the female bloggers that were profiled went live debbie believe it or not sent me an email complaining that emily had been profiled while she hadn t _meta_end_dot_

 when i pointed out to debbie that i had offered to profile her for the piece she claimed that wasn t true and that she had wanted to be profiled _meta_end_dot_

 if that story sounds odd to you from beginning to end well it ain t just you buddy _meta_end_dot_

 let me also note that after debbie complained to me originally about emily i got emily s side of the story and did some research on my own _meta_end_dot_

 what i found was that while there is a grain of truth to what debbie is saying her story doesn t hold up under scrutiny _meta_end_dot_

 emily didn t defend any threats against debbie she just mocked debbie and the lunatic debbie was fighting with simultaneously which apparently was something debbie s titanic sized ego couldn t handle _meta_end_dot_

 yes emily was given incorrect info about debbie and posted it in the comments section of another blog but she also retracted it apologized and had it deleted and keep in mind that we re almost _meta_number_ref_ years out from when this happened _meta_end_dot_

 additionally debbie didn t get emily fired and emily wasn t forced to leave her job although debbie was obsessed enough to call emily s job multiple times and complain about her _meta_end_dot_

 now after all of that i could understand if debbie didn t like emily but she seems to be under the impression that emily shouldn t be able to hold a job or ever be linked by another conservative blog just because she offended the great and mightly debbie schlussel which is warped beyond all reason _meta_end_dot_

 now i d rather have just stayed out of this whole thing but since debbie has been publicly smearing a friend of mine in response to an article i wrote making a pain of herself in the comments section of my blog and has dragged my name into it i think i have a duty to publicly point out that debbie is acting like an insanely vindictive obsessive bully with delusions of grandeur _meta_end_dot_

 also see um yeah at the american princess _meta_end_dot_
