  because of the widespread hatred between kosovo and the serbs a lot of people have been supportive of kosovo declaring independence _meta_end_dot_

 i am not one of them _meta_end_dot_

 this story helps explain why hopes for a peaceful conclusion to the declaration of kosovo s independence were fading as the european union announced it had withdrawn its staff from the north of the fledgling country in the face of increasingly angry serb protests so begins the utterly predictable reaction of the eu to serb anger as their army in suits pre emptively withdraws _meta_end_dot_

 at the same time kfor the nato led peacekeeping force sealed the border to serbia after angry mobs torched border crossings _meta_end_dot_

 yesterday peter feith the eu s kosovo envoy said security concerns were behind the withdrawal of his staff from northern kosovo _meta_end_dot_

 they had been preparing the ground for a _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ strong eu rule of law mission _meta_end_dot_

 i would like to appeal to the serb community to be generous and to turn the page and look forward to working together with us he said _meta_end_dot_

 we hope that conditions will soon allow us to resume our activities translation _meta_end_dot_

 we ll return when nato makes it safe enough for us to return _meta_end_dot_

 first of all the only reason kosovo wasn t being overrun by serbians before they declared independence was because a nato led force was there _meta_end_dot_

 now the only thing keeping serbia from thwarting what they consider to be an illegitimate independence is those same foreign troops _meta_end_dot_

 moreover we could be in exactly the same situation a decade or two from now _meta_end_dot_

 so by declaring independence all kosovo is really doing is making themselves a permanent protectorate of nato and we all know the us provides most of the muscle for nato _meta_end_dot_

 so what s in kosovo that s worth the life of a single american soldier _meta_end_question_

 why shouldn t we step aside and let western europe and kosovo work the whole thing out with serbia russia and the many other nations that are opposed to independence _meta_end_question_

 it s not our fight and it shouldn t be our problem _meta_end_dot_

 moreover there are hundreds of regions across the world that could make just as good a case for independence as kosovo _meta_end_dot_

 should we be encouraging them to do just that _meta_end_question_

 if even a third of them went through with it how many wars would it cause _meta_end_question_

 long story short kosovo s independence is a can of worms that would be better left closed and failing that our nation should disentangle itself from the whole mess at the first opportunity _meta_end_dot_
