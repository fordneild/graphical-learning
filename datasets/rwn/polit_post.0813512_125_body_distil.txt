  not only is the gop losing special elections it s managing to lose elections in districts where its candidates should be winning by _meta_number_ref_ points without even campaigning democrat travis childers won tuesday s mississippi special election runoff for sen _meta_end_dot_

 roger wicker s r former house seat handing democrats the biggest of their three special election takeovers this cycle and sending a listless gop further into a state of disarray _meta_end_dot_

 childers led gop candidate greg davis _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ with more than _meta_number_ref_ percent of precincts reporting _meta_end_dot_

 turnout increased substantially over the _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ voters who cast ballots in the april _meta_number_ref_ open special election with more than _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ voting in the runoff _meta_end_dot_

 childers who beat davis _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ three weeks ago but came up just shy of a race ending majority joins new democratic reps _meta_end_dot_

 bill foster ill and don cazayoux la to give democrats a trifecta of upsets in conservative house districts over the last two months _meta_end_dot_

 the loss could send shockwaves through the republican party where murmurs about a leadership shakeup have become more and more audible _meta_end_dot_

 democrats are backing up the assertion that they remain on the offensive in the cycle following a _meta_number_ref_ seat gain which has historically not been the case after a wave election _meta_end_dot_

 wicker s former district voted _meta_number_ref_ percent for president bush in _meta_number_ref_ and by that measure is one of the most conservative seats democrats have taken from the gop over the last _meta_number_ref_ months including the _meta_number_ref_ election _meta_end_dot_

 the gop got massacred at the ballot box in _meta_number_ref_ and if this year isn t quite as awful it s only going to be because the democrats plucked so much low hanging fruit in _meta_number_ref_ that they re going to have to keep picking up strong republican districts to add seats _meta_end_dot_

 let me add that it s too bad that the republican leadership in the house may end up on the chopping block over these losses because from what i ve seen they re pretty much the only republican leaders in dc who can find their own sses with both hands _meta_end_dot_

 yet even when they do a good job it seems like a drop in the bucket compared to the screw ups of bush mccain the senate the rnc etc _meta_end_dot_

 ps what you re seeing is the result of the republican party s leadership such as it is becoming arrogant complacent and coming to believe that they re so smart that they don t need to listen to the people who put them in office to begin with _meta_end_dot_
