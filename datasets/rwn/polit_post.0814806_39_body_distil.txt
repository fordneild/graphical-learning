  from the horse s mouth you got into these small towns in pennsylvania and like a lot of small towns in the midwest the jobs have been gone now for _meta_number_ref_ years and nothing s replaced them _meta_end_dot_

 and they fell through the clinton administration and the bush administration and each successive administration has said that somehow these communities are gonna regenerate and they have not _meta_end_dot_

 and it s not surprising then they get bitter they cling to guns or religion or antipathy to people who aren t like them or anti immigrant sentiment or anti trade sentiment as a way to explain their frustrations barack obama anybody gone into whole foods lately and see what they charge for arugula _meta_end_question_

 i mean they re charging a lot of money for this stuff barack obama you know the truth is that right after _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ i had a flag pin _meta_end_dot_

 shortly after _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ particularly because as we re talking about the iraq war that became a substitute for i think true patriotism which is speaking out on issues that are of importance to our national security i decided i won t wear that pin on my chest barack obama and if that child should ever get the chance to travel the world and someone should ask her where is she from we believe that she should always be able to hold her head high with pride in her voice when she answers i am an american that is the course we seek _meta_end_dot_

 that is the change we are calling for barack obama i had learned not to care _meta_end_dot_

 i blew a few smoke rings remembering those years _meta_end_dot_

 pot had helped and booze maybe a little blow when you could afford it _meta_end_dot_

 not smack though _meta_end_dot_

 barack obama junkie _meta_end_dot_

 pothead _meta_end_dot_

 that s where i d been headed the final fatal role of the young would be black man _meta_end_dot_

 except the highs hadn t been about that me trying to prove what a down brother i was _meta_end_dot_

 not by then anyway _meta_end_dot_

 i got high for just the opposite effect something that could push questions of who i was out of my mind something that could flatten out the landscape of my heart blur the edges of my memory _meta_end_dot_

 i had discovered that it didn t make any difference whether you smoked reefer in the white classmate s sparkling new van or in the dorm room of some brother you d met down at the gym or on the beach with a couple of hawaiian kids who had dropped out of school and now spent most of their time looking for an excuse to brawl _meta_end_dot_

 you might just be bored or alone _meta_end_dot_

 everybody was welcome into the club of disaffection barack obama i inhaled frequently _meta_end_dot_

 that was the point barack obama i opposed the defense of marriage act in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 it should be repealed and i will vote for its repeal on the senate floor _meta_end_dot_

 i will also oppose any proposal to amend the u s _meta_end_dot_

 constitution to ban gays and lesbians from marrying barack obama i am not in favor of concealed weapons _meta_end_dot_

 i think that creates a potential atmosphere where more innocent people could get shot during altercations barack obama i ve got two daughters _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ years old and _meta_number_ref_ years old _meta_end_dot_

 i am going to teach them first of all about values and morals _meta_end_dot_

 but if they make a mistake i don t want them punished with a baby barack obama on this memorial day as our nation honors its unbroken line of fallen heroes and i see many of them in the audience here today our sense of patriotism is particularly strong barack obama over the last _meta_number_ref_ months we ve traveled to every corner of the united states _meta_end_dot_

 i ve now been in _meta_number_ref_ states _meta_end_question_

 i think one left to go barack obama as sen _meta_end_dot_

 hillary clinton was preparing to campaign here today sen _meta_end_dot_

 barack obama was meeting with voters at a diner and apparently pretty hungry _meta_end_dot_

 why can t i just eat my waffle he said when asked a foreign policy question by a reporter at the glider diner barack obama we can t drive our suvs and eat as much as we want and keep our homes on _meta_number_ref_ degrees at all times _meta_end_dot_

 and then just expect that other countries are going to say ok _meta_end_dot_

 that s not leadership _meta_end_dot_

 that s not going to happen barack obama it was usually an effective tactic another one of those tricks i had learned white people were satisfied so long as you were courteous and smiled and made no sudden moves _meta_end_dot_

 they were more than satisfied they were relieved such a pleasant surprise to find a well mannered young black man who didn t seem angry all the time barack obama i can no more disown jeremiah wright than i can disown the black community _meta_end_dot_

 i can no more disown him than i can my white grandmother a woman who helped raise me a woman who sacrificed again and again for me a woman who loves me as much as she loves anything in this world but a woman who once confessed her fear of black men who passed by her on the street and who on more than one occasion has uttered racial or ethnic stereotypes that made me cringe barack obama the point i was making was not that grandmother harbors any racial animosity _meta_end_dot_

 she doesn t _meta_end_dot_

 but she is a typical white person barack obama barack s race baiting spiritual mentor confidant what i value most about pastor wright is not his day to day political advice _meta_end_dot_

 he s much more of a sounding board for me to make sure that i am speaking as truthfully about what i believe as possible and that i m not losing myself in some of the hype and hoopla and stress that s involved in national politics barack obama just before obama s nationally televised campaign kickoff rally last feb _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ the candidate disinvited wright from giving the public invocation _meta_end_dot_

 wright explained when obama s enemies find out that in _meta_number_ref_ i went to tripoli to visit col _meta_end_dot_

 muammar el qaddafi with nation of islam leader louis farrakhan a lot of his jewish support will dry up quicker than a snowball in hell according to wright obama then told him you can get kind of rough in the sermons so what we ve decided is that it s best for you not to be out there in public but privately obama and his family prayed with wright just before the presidential announcement ronald kessler newsmax racism is how this country was founded and how this country is still run _meta_end_dot_

 no black man will ever be considered for president no matter how hard you run jesse jackson and no black woman can ever be considered for anything outside what she can give with her body jeremiah wright white folks greed runs a world in need jeremiah wright in the _meta_number_ref_st century white america got a wake up call after _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 white america and the western world came to realize that people of color had not gone away faded into the woodwork or just disappeared as the great white west kept on its merry way of ignoring black concerns jeremiah wright the government gives them the drugs builds bigger prisons passes a three strike law and then wants us to sing god bless america no no no god d mn america that s in the bible for killing innocent people _meta_end_dot_

 god d mn america for treating our citizens as less than human _meta_end_dot_

 god d mn america for as long as she acts like she is god and she is supreme jeremiah wright we have supported state terrorism against the palestinians and black south africans and now we are indignant because the stuff we have done overseas is now brought right back to our own front yards _meta_end_dot_

 america s chickens are coming home to roost jeremiah wright america is still the no _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ killer in the world jeremiah wright we started the aids virus _meta_end_dot_

 we are only able to maintain our level of living by making sure that third world people live in grinding poverty jeremiah wright the government lied about inventing the hiv virus as a means of genocide against people of color _meta_end_dot_

 the government lied jeremiah wright theresa heinz obama america is just downright mean michelle obama for the first time in my adult lifetime i am really proud of my country _meta_end_dot_

 and not just because barack has done well but because i think people are hungry for change _meta_end_dot_

 and i have been desperate to see our country moving in that direction michelle obama t he realities are that you know as a black man you know barack can get shot going to the gas station you know michelle obama what i notice about men all men is that their order is me my family god is in there somewhere but me is first michelle obama i wake up every morning wondering how on earth i am going to pull off that next minor miracle to get through the day _meta_end_dot_

 i know that everybody in this room is going through this _meta_end_dot_

 that is the dilemma women face today _meta_end_dot_

 every woman that i know regardless of race education income background political affiliation is struggling to keep her head above water michelle obama who s got time to go to the fruit stand _meta_end_question_

 who can afford it first of all michelle obama asked how she feels about bill clinton s use of the phrase fairytale to describe her husband s characterization of his position on the iraq war michelle obama first responded no but after a few seconds of contemplation and gesturing with her fingernails she told the reporter i want to rip his eyes out noticing an aide giving her a nervous look she added kidding _meta_end_exclamation_

 see this is what gets me into trouble worldnetdaily the truth is in order to get things like universal health care and a revamped education system then someone is going to have to give up a piece of their pie so that someone else can have more michelle obama barack obama will require you to work _meta_end_dot_

 he is going to demand that you shed your cynicism _meta_end_dot_

 that you put down your divisions _meta_end_dot_

 that you come out of your isolation that you move out of your comfort zones _meta_end_dot_

 that you push yourselves to be better _meta_end_dot_

 and that you engage _meta_end_dot_

 barack will never allow you to go back to your lives as usual uninvolved uninformed michelle obama the best of the rest so i think obama definitely has convinced people that he stands for change and for hope and i can t wait to see what he stands for susan sarandon i m not the first to point out that the obama campaign seems dangerously close to becoming a cult of personality paul krugman obama is all style _meta_end_dot_

 no substance _meta_end_dot_

 he s all i want to send children to the moon and then when you ask how he says hope dawn summers obama s big themes are change hope and unity i suspect that after he s elected we ll hear much less about change and unity and a lot more about hope _meta_end_dot_

 as in i hope this doesn t end in a huge disaster _meta_end_dot_

 i hope he doesn t wreck the economy _meta_end_dot_

 i hope he s not too overwhelmed by the complexity and horror of the world _meta_end_dot_

 i hope i survive this administration a reader at the corner if obama was a white man he would not be in this position _meta_end_dot_

 and if he was a woman of any color he would not be in this position _meta_end_dot_

 he happens to be very lucky to be who he is _meta_end_dot_

 and the country is caught up in the concept geraldine ferraro so now we are in this orwellian paradox of seeing obama s base turn out in record numbers on the basis apparently of race but on the other hand the implied warning that if anyone else were likewise to consider that fact then he would be racialist _meta_end_dot_

 so is he an identity politics candidate or a post racialist unifier _meta_end_question_

 or both _meta_end_question_

 it all reminds me of the perennial complaints of the national council of la raza the race lecturing insensitive others about their unfair consideration of race in matters of illegal immigration _meta_end_dot_

 this is very disappointing because lost in obamania is the complete repudiation of his original promise precisely not to become a racial candidate victor davis hanson after his victory last week in wisconsin and again at the austin debate obama revealed himself to be the most liberal candidate since george mcgovern _meta_end_dot_

 he is not thrilled with building a border fence _meta_end_dot_

 he wants to meet with raul castro _meta_end_dot_

 he will raise taxes and spend a boatload of money on new programs _meta_end_dot_

 he will exit iraq pronto and spend that money on domestic programs _meta_end_dot_

 he opposes any restriction on partial birth abortion and thinks the district of columbia s total handgun ban is a common sense regulation jennifer rubin obama voted against a bill that would add penalties for crimes committed as a part of gang activity and against a bill that would make it a criminal offense for accused gang members free on bond or probation to associate with other gang members _meta_end_dot_

 in _meta_number_ref_ he was the only state senator to oppose a bill that prohibited early prison release for criminal sexual offenders amanda carpenter here is a guy who when he visited regarding hanford washington said here s something that you will rarely hear from a politician and that is that i m not familiar with the hanford uuuuhh site so i don t know exactly what s going on there _meta_end_dot_

 applause now having said that i promise you i ll learn about it by the time i leave here on the ride back to the airport _meta_end_dot_

 wow _meta_end_dot_

 and the crowd applauded him _meta_end_exclamation_

 here s the kicker obama voted on funding for the hanford facility say anything explaining last week why he was trailing hillary clinton in kentucky obama again botched basic geography sen _meta_end_dot_

 clinton i think is much better known coming from a nearby state of arkansas _meta_end_dot_

 so it s not surprising that she would have an advantage in some of those states in the middle on what map is arkansas closer to kentucky than illinois michelle malkin obama has as much trouble with numbers as he has with maps _meta_end_dot_

 last march on the anniversary of the bloody sunday march in selma ala he claimed his parents united as a direct result of the civil rights movement there was something stirring across the country because of what happened in selma ala because some folks are willing to march across a bridge _meta_end_dot_

 so they got together and barack obama jr _meta_end_dot_

 was born obama was born in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 the selma march took place in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 his spokesman bill burton later explained that obama was speaking metaphorically about the civil rights movement as a whole michelle malkin dig it _meta_end_exclamation_

 manson killed those pigs then they ate dinner in the same room with them then they shoved a fork into a victim s stomach obama s friend bernardine dohrn we made mistakes and we d do it again _meta_end_dot_

 i wish that we d done more _meta_end_dot_

 i wish we d been more militant obama s friend bernardine dohrn i don t regret setting bombs _meta_end_dot_

 i feel we didn t do enough obama s friend bill ayers kill all the rich people _meta_end_dot_

 break up their cars and apartments _meta_end_dot_

 bring the revolution home kill your parents that s where it s really at obama s friend bill ayers in _meta_number_ref_ if hillary gave obama one of her cojones they d both have two james carville i have a lifetime of experience that i will bring to the white house _meta_end_dot_

 i know senator mccain has a lifetime of experience that he will bring to the white house _meta_end_dot_

 and senator obama has a speech he gave in _meta_number_ref_ hillary clinton unlike senator obama my admiration respect and deep gratitude for america s veterans is something more than a convenient campaign pledge john mccain obama really has no experience or knowledge or judgment about the issue of iraq and he has wanted to surrender for a long time john mccain i take a backseat to no one in my affection respect and devotion to veterans _meta_end_dot_

 and i will not accept from senator obama who did not feel it was his responsibility to serve our country in uniform any lectures on my regard for those who did john mccain
