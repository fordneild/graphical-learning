  mitch mcconnell suggests in the wsj that notwithstanding it being an election year and all that congress might consider doing its job with respect to the energy crisis the gas price reduction act is composed of just a few ideas _meta_end_dot_

 but taken together the proposals will address the problem head on _meta_end_dot_

 they include deep sea exploration more than _meta_number_ref_ miles off the coasts of the states that want it lifting a ban on development of the promising and plentiful oil shale deposits in western states and increased incentives for the development of plug in electric cars and trucks _meta_end_dot_

 the bill also includes provisions to strengthen u s _meta_end_dot_

 futures markets and guard against excessive speculation _meta_end_dot_

 the gas price reduction act is a sensible approach to gas prices that squarely faces something too many in washington would rather ignore the law of supply and demand _meta_end_dot_

 conservation is an idea that both parties support and both parties have addressed legislatively _meta_end_dot_

 but if prices are going to go down supply has to go up too _meta_end_dot_

 this means democrats will have to abandon their traditional opposition to domestic exploration by lifting a congressional ban on off shore exploration _meta_end_dot_

 don t forget the flex fuel vehicles guys they re just as essential as hybrids electrics to the transition we re entering _meta_end_dot_

 probably more so _meta_end_dot_

 unless you wanted to re build the entire transportation infrastructure of this country from scratch _meta_end_question_

 i didn t think so _meta_end_dot_
