  there s very little that barack obama says that s worth applauding _meta_end_dot_

 in fact most of his shtick consists of completely empty rhetoric about hope and change combined with a few dashes of whining and liberalism _meta_end_dot_

 however this sunday barack obama was spot on for once addressing a packed congregation at one of the city s largest black churches senator barack obama on sunday invoked his own absent father to deliver a sharp message to african american men saying we need fathers to realize that responsibility does not end at conception too many fathers are m i a too many fathers are awol missing from too many lives and too many homes mr _meta_end_dot_

 obama said to a chorus of approving murmurs from the audience _meta_end_dot_

 they have abandoned their responsibilities acting like boys instead of men _meta_end_dot_

 and the foundations of our families are weaker because of it the speech was striking for its setting and in how mr _meta_end_dot_

 obama the presumptive democratic presidential nominee directly addressed one of the most sensitive topics in the african american community whether absent fathers bore responsibility for some of the intractable problems afflicting black americans _meta_end_dot_

 mr _meta_end_dot_

 obama noted that more than half of all black children live in single parent households a number that he said had doubled since his own childhood _meta_end_dot_

 accompanied by his wife michelle and his daughters malia and sasha who sat in the front pew mr _meta_end_dot_

 obama laid out his case in stark terms that would be difficult for a white candidate to make telling the mostly black audience not to just sit in the house watching sportscenter and to stop praising themselves for mediocre accomplishments _meta_end_dot_

 don t get carried away with that eighth grade graduation he said bringing many members of the congregation to their feet applauding _meta_end_dot_

 you re supposed to graduate from eighth grade his themes have been also been sounded by the comedian bill cosby who has stirred debate among black americans by bluntly speaking about an epidemic of fatherless african american families while suggesting that some blacks use racism as a crutch to explain lack of economic progress _meta_end_dot_

 clap clap clap _meta_end_dot_

 i guess even a blind squirrel grabs a nut every once in a while _meta_end_dot_
