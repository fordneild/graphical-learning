  you better enjoy right wing news while you can because according to the new york times i may be about to drop dead at any time they work long hours often to exhaustion _meta_end_dot_

 many are paid by the piece not garments but blog posts _meta_end_dot_

 this is the digital era sweatshop _meta_end_dot_

 you may know it by a different name home _meta_end_dot_

 a growing work force of home office laborers and entrepreneurs armed with computers and smartphones and wired to the hilt are toiling under great physical and emotional stress created by the around the clock internet economy that demands a constant stream of news and comment _meta_end_dot_

 two weeks ago in north lauderdale fla funeral services were held for russell shaw a prolific blogger on technology subjects who died at _meta_number_ref_ of a heart attack _meta_end_dot_

 in december another tech blogger marc orchant died at _meta_number_ref_ of a massive coronary _meta_end_dot_

 a third om malik _meta_number_ref_ survived a heart attack in december _meta_end_dot_

 other bloggers complain of weight loss or gain sleep disorders exhaustion and other maladies born of the nonstop strain of producing for a news and information cycle that is as always on as the internet _meta_end_dot_

 to be sure there is no official diagnosis of death by blogging and the premature demise of two people obviously does not qualify as an epidemic _meta_end_dot_

 there is also no certainty that the stress of the work contributed to their deaths _meta_end_dot_

 but friends and family of the deceased and fellow information workers say those deaths have them thinking about the dangers of their work style _meta_end_dot_

 the pressure even gets to those who work for themselves and are being well compensated for it _meta_end_dot_

 i haven t died yet said michael arrington the founder and co editor of techcrunch a popular technology blog _meta_end_dot_

 the site has brought in millions in advertising revenue but there has been a hefty cost _meta_end_dot_

 mr _meta_end_dot_

 arrington says he has gained _meta_number_ref_ pounds in the last three years developed a severe sleeping disorder and turned his home into an office for him and four employees _meta_end_dot_

 at some point i ll have a nervous breakdown and be admitted to the hospital or something else will happen this is not sustainable he said many of you out there respect firemen policemen and other selfless public servants who risk their very lives to serve our country but i think it s time that you started acknowledging the heroes of a new generation bloggers _meta_end_dot_

 sure i know what you re thinking wow you live a tough life man _meta_end_dot_

 in fact i m surprised all the blogging isn t done by illegal immigrants because if there is any such thing as a job americans won t do it has gotta be blogging yes that s very true _meta_end_dot_

 but those of us out here risking our lives in the field bloggers coal miners lumberjacks are cut out of a different cloth than ordinary people _meta_end_dot_

 yes we realize we have tough jobs but because we exude manliness like an adorable puppy exudes cuteness we can make it work _meta_end_dot_

 ps in all seriousness it does take some long hours to put out rwn and cg but that could be said of a lot of jobs _meta_end_dot_

 but as a general rule if you re not putting in more than _meta_number_ref_ hours a week at a job you re not putting in enough work to really excel at it _meta_end_dot_

 is it stressful _meta_end_question_

 honestly i don t think so _meta_end_dot_

 being able to get up when you want go to bed when you want set your own hours and work at a job you love without having to take orders from a boss _meta_end_question_

 that is just a great way to live _meta_end_dot_

 if doing this gets you so stressed out that you re about to have a heart attack or a nervous breakdown i gotta tell you either you re just not cut out for it you re doing it wrong or you ve never worked at a really tough job _meta_end_dot_
