  for the first time in my adult life i am proud of my country because it feels like hope is making a comeback michelle obama let s see the wife has never been proud of her own country until her husband had a chance to be president and the husband opposes flag pins and putting his hand over his heart for the national anthem _meta_end_dot_

 they d make a great first couple in cuba _meta_end_dot_

 maybe barack can make some calls over there since i hear they have an opening at the top and if anybody needs hope it s the long suffering people of cuba not the citizens of the greatest nation the world has ever seen _meta_end_dot_

 update _meta_number_ref_ via my pal cassy fiano here s susan sarandon well i m going to back obama _meta_end_dot_

 but i hope i think that he as a symbol has really excited people and he s definitely confusing to everyone who really hates america for hating muslims because a name like obama and a black man they re probably going to go oh wait a minute what it s kind of like when you re out on the line for freedom to have an abortion and you re incredibly pregnant _meta_end_dot_

 they just can t quite figure it out _meta_end_dot_

 so i think he definitely has convinced people that he stands for change and for hope and i can t wait to see what he stands for _meta_end_dot_

 that last sentence is probably the best sum up of the entire obama campaign that i have ever seen so i think barack obama definitely has convinced people that he stands for change and for hope and i can t wait to see what he stands for _meta_end_dot_
