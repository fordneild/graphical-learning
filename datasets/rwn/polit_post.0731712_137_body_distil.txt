 here s a little breakdown ranking the top tier candidates on their conservatism _meta_number_ref_ rudy giuliani ideologically he s a tough talking arlen specter _meta_end_dot_

 in other words he s not conservative at all and if you look at his record as a whole from his time in nyc you could even make a case that he was just to the left of center on domestic policy _meta_end_dot_

 tie _meta_number_ref_ mike huckabee he s a more socially conservative version of george bush with great people skills _meta_end_dot_

 in other words if you re a fan of big government republicans mike s your man _meta_end_dot_

 tie _meta_number_ref_ john mccain mccain isn t a movement conservative is unfriendly to social conservatives and he is best known amongst conservatives for high profile betrayals on the right but he is at least fiscally conservative _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ mitt romney it s extremely difficult to rank mitt because he s the classic example of a politician who tells his audiences what they want to hear _meta_end_dot_

 when he was in massachusetts he came across as a rino in the early years governed moderately to the right of center and now he is trying to come across as ronald reagan reincarnated _meta_end_dot_

 of course if he does win the nomination he can be expected to move a few steps back to the center _meta_end_dot_

 in other words he doesn t seem to have a lot of core beliefs and he ll take conservative positions as long as he believes that it s advantageous to him at the polls _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ fred thompson a real movement conservative who believes in federalism small government and fiscal conservatism _meta_end_dot_
