  this column by heather harrison which appeared in canada s vancouver sun actually advocates well just take a look _meta_end_dot_

 should political parties impose quotas in the nomination process to increase female representation _meta_end_question_

 the answer is an emphatic yes not only has gender equity not been achieved in canada but in the past _meta_number_ref_ years the proportion of women in public office has slipped _meta_end_dot_

 today while women constitute _meta_number_ref_ per cent of the population they represent less than _meta_number_ref_ per cent of our elected officials _meta_end_dot_

 canada now falls behind iraq in the proportion of women elected _meta_end_dot_

 this lack of representation ought to disturb us _meta_end_dot_

 according to the united nations a threshold of at least _meta_number_ref_ per cent female legislators is required to ensure that public policy reflects the needs of women _meta_end_dot_

 contrary to what is often argued the current nomination processes do not produce the best candidates possible _meta_end_dot_

 since talent intelligence ability and education are equally distributed between the genders the best way to guarantee that we are not wasting our human resources is to achieve gender parity _meta_end_dot_

 election results in canada demonstrate that voters are more willing to elect a woman to government than political parties are to nominate them _meta_end_dot_

 for example in the _meta_number_ref_ federal election only _meta_number_ref_ per cent of ndp candidates were women yet _meta_number_ref_ per cent of ndp candidates elected were women _meta_end_dot_

 without targets and quotas political parties take the path of least resistance which virtually guarantees that men will be nominated _meta_end_dot_

 political parties in canada however are unwilling to enforce quotas out of concerns about reverse discrimination _meta_end_dot_

 it is true that willing men may be denied the right to run for elected positions and in a democratic society we do not want to take away any individual s choice to run for office _meta_end_dot_

 however it is important to recognize that society sometimes must choose between conflicting principles _meta_end_dot_

 so only when there is a critical mass of women elected to government and the needs of women are being addressed by public policy can we expect to have true equal access to the electoral process for women _meta_end_dot_

 you ve got to love the left s extraordinarily shallow thinking wait that s not quite right the left s extraordinarily shallow feeling about diversity _meta_end_dot_

 to them diversity means that men can t represent women whites can t represent blacks etc _meta_end_dot_

 only another member of whatever group that they ve segmented you into can properly represent you _meta_end_dot_

 but what about thought _meta_end_question_

 why that s irrelevant compared to things like skin color and gender _meta_end_dot_

 to liberals a group featuring _meta_number_ref_ black liberal women _meta_number_ref_ black conservative women and _meta_number_ref_ black moderate women is monolithic but a group featuring _meta_number_ref_ women from different ethnic groups who all have the exact same liberal views is extremely diverse _meta_end_dot_

 moreover another staggeringly ignorant facet of the liberal view on diversity is that they don t accept that there can be any actual diversity that produces differences unfavorable to the groups they want to cater to whereas differences unfavorable to groups they tend to be hostile to white males christians conservatives etc are ignored _meta_end_dot_

 for example in her piece harrison notes that contrary to what is often argued the current nomination processes do not produce the best candidates possible _meta_end_dot_

 since talent intelligence ability and education are equally distributed between the genders the best way to guarantee that we are not wasting our human resources is to achieve gender parity ehr wait we need more women in government to promote diversity but apparently there are no meaningful differences between men and women that might lead to more men being elected to office _meta_end_question_

 does that really make sense _meta_end_question_

 if men and women are identical in every way that matters why do we need gender quotas _meta_end_question_

 moreover couldn t the differences between men and women explain why less women are in office _meta_end_question_

 for example isn t it possible that women just aren t on the whole as interested as men in politics and therefore fewer women are interested in running for office _meta_end_question_

 also along those same lines does the conclusion really make sense _meta_end_question_

 so only when there is a critical mass of women elected to government and the needs of women are being addressed by public policy can we expect to have true equal access to the electoral process for women if the needs of women aren t being addressed by public policy and women just by virtue of being female can better represent their own sex how is it that men keep getting elected in a nation where women make up _meta_number_ref_ _meta_percent_ref_ of the population _meta_end_question_

 obviously a lot of women in canada must feel that men are adequately addressing their needs or else they wouldn t be voting for them _meta_end_dot_

 ps just give em a few years and the left will not only be demanding that we have gender quotas like this in america they ll be claiming that the constitution requires that there be quotas and anybody who opposes them obviously hates women _meta_end_dot_

 hat tip to small dead animals _meta_end_dot_
