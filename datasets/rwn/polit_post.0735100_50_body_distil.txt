  michelle malkin has been following closely the murder of ontario _meta_number_ref_ year old aqsa parvez who was killed by her father in what has been described as an apparent honor killing here was the national post s story on the murder toronto a mississauga ont cab driver has been charged with the murder of his _meta_number_ref_ year old daughter who was attacked in the family home after clashing with her strict muslim family over whether or not to wear the hijab the traditional islamic head scarf for women _meta_end_dot_

 muhammad parvez _meta_number_ref_ was charged after his daughter aqsa parvez died in hospital late monday _meta_end_dot_

 the victim s older brother waqas parvez was charged with obstructing police in connection with the girl s death _meta_end_dot_

 police were called to a home in mississauga early monday morning by a man who told _meta_number_ref_ operators that he had killed his daughter _meta_end_dot_

 they found aqsa parvez lying motionless on the floor of her bedroom to all appearances dead but paramedics found a faint pulse and rushed her to hospital _meta_end_dot_

 the teenager succumbed to her injuries several hours later police said tuesday _meta_end_dot_

 const _meta_end_dot_

 j p _meta_end_dot_

 valade would not give any details about the teenager s killing but police sources said she was strangled _meta_end_dot_

 friends of the girl said she had left the family home where her brothers also lived with their families about a week before the attack because of arguments with her father and brothers over her refusal to wear traditional muslim garb including the hijab _meta_end_dot_

 she was scared of her father he was always controlling her said dominiquia holmes thompson a friend and classmate at applewood heights secondary school where both were grade _meta_number_ref_ students _meta_end_dot_

 she wasn t allowed to go out or do anything that s why she left the post s barbara kay wonders if the canadian judicial system will accept the my culture made me do it defense that was successful in a recent ruling in a rape case in australia we begin in australia and the trial results of a _meta_number_ref_ rape of a _meta_number_ref_ year old aboriginal girl by a group of nine aboriginal men and adolescents _meta_end_dot_

 district court judge sarah bradley gave all of them probation or suspended sentences no jail time and no criminal records _meta_end_dot_

 bradley concluded that the victim was not forced and she probably agreed to have sex with all of you this girl had been a sexual pawn since the age of seven _meta_end_dot_

 she is the kind of human wreckage that should have inspired amongst anguished feminists a mass demonstration with candles white ribbons and demands for life sentences for her attackers _meta_end_dot_

 but the judge was a woman the girl and her attackers from a minority culture creating the perfect ideological storm _meta_end_dot_

 how could any woman get it so wrong _meta_end_question_

 it s like this indoctrinated in multicultural feminism judge bradley is a moral and cultural relativist _meta_end_dot_

 any sexual aggression against her own daughter would be anathema but the cultural values of the other are sacrosanct and must be respected _meta_end_dot_

 thus that judge didn t see a _meta_number_ref_ year old girl _meta_end_dot_

 she didn t see an individual _meta_end_dot_

 she saw aboriginal others engaged in behaviours particular to their culture and she assumed it would be wrong to impose her standards on them _meta_end_dot_

 believe it or not i am sure she thought she was being sensitive to their difference a fired up michael coren expressed in yesterday s toronto sun what a lot of us have been feeling since learning about this case and hearing from canadian apologists who are already lining up to suggest that these types of killings aren t unique to islam and that islam is a religion of peace it s the episode of little mosque on the prairie that i missed _meta_end_dot_

 the one where the father is so angry with his teenage daughter for not wearing the hijab that he strangles her to death _meta_end_dot_

 perhaps it will be in the special features section of the dvd version released just in time for the holiday that used to be known as christmas but not any longer because the word might hurt someone s feelings _meta_end_dot_

 not that we know why or even if muhammad parvez killed his _meta_number_ref_ year old daughter aqsa last week in mississauga ont _meta_end_dot_

 but we do know that he has been charged with the crime and that friends told reporters there had been terrible arguments about aqsa s refusal to wear islamic head covering and that she wanted a different path from that of her family _meta_end_dot_

 most canadian muslim leaders immediately condemned what had happened but it didn t take very long for the usual suspects to explain on radio and television that the tragedy had nothing to do with the muslim faith and that all religions contain extremism _meta_end_dot_

 islam we were told is a religion of peace _meta_end_dot_

 which is probably just what the owner of a christian bookstore in gaza thought three months ago as he was murdered and his shop firebombed _meta_end_dot_

 or danny pearl shortly before the american journalist had his head cut off by islamic terrorists who naturally filmed the whole thing and made sure their chants from the koran were loud and clear _meta_end_dot_

 or the wretched gang rape victim in saudi arabia sentenced to _meta_number_ref_ lashes for daring to be in a car at the time of the crime with a man to whom she was not married or related _meta_end_dot_

 or the women stoned to death for adultery _meta_end_dot_

 or the iranian men hanged because they were homosexual _meta_end_dot_

 and on and on _meta_end_dot_

 on until the denial is sickening _meta_end_dot_

 it s cultural it s because of colonialism it s because of palestine because of iraq because of misunderstanding _meta_end_dot_

 because of anything other than islam _meta_end_dot_

 only a bigot would argue that every muslim was violent or opposed to western freedom _meta_end_dot_

 but only a coward or a liar would argue that there was not a profound and deeply worrying link between conservative islam and myriad acts of terror intolerance and hysterical anger _meta_end_dot_

 it is not i who say this but the countless muslims who take to the streets at the drop of a cartoon to scream for blood and war or the muslims who preach jihad in north america and europe where they enjoy open societies founded on christian enlightenment _meta_end_dot_

 they may represent a minority but the harm they do is incalculable _meta_end_dot_

 this dysfunctional venom does not come from christian jew hindu or buddhist and fatuous relativism will only blind the foolish _meta_end_dot_

 it is time for free discussion in this free country whether it offends or not _meta_end_dot_

 amen _meta_end_dot_
