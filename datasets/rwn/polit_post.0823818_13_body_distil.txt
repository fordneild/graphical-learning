  conversation with an acquaintance in anticipation of school starting acquaintance i m not happy about my son s class placement _meta_end_dot_

 well the teacher is good but the kid who rubbed his penis against another kid and then peed on his leg last year is in my kid s class _meta_end_dot_

 me so ask to get your kid switched _meta_end_dot_

 acquaintance well what do you think about karma _meta_end_question_

 you know that he s meant to be in that class _meta_end_question_

 me i think you need to get your kid switched _meta_end_dot_

 acquaintance i was not really happy with kid genius education last year _meta_end_dot_

 he didn t learn anything _meta_end_dot_

 me he s what _meta_number_ref_ or _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_question_

 acquaintance yeah _meta_end_dot_

 these are the formative years _meta_end_dot_

 the foundation _meta_end_dot_

 me no they aren t _meta_end_dot_

 first grade is for fun _meta_end_dot_

 really elementary school is a waste generally speaking _meta_end_dot_

 acquaintance do you really believe that _meta_end_question_

 me yes _meta_end_dot_

 it should be a lot more fun than it is _meta_end_dot_

 i mean can your kid read and comprehend what he s reading _meta_end_question_

 that s all that counts really _meta_end_dot_

 acquaintance yes he can read but i m worried about his math skills _meta_end_dot_

 me they ll come _meta_end_dot_

 acquaintance yes but he learned like nothing last year _meta_end_dot_

 me it s public school _meta_end_dot_

 acquaintance but don t you think they should learn something _meta_end_question_

 me in theory yes _meta_end_dot_

 but it s public school _meta_end_dot_

 i don t have high expectations _meta_end_dot_

 in fact brace yourself because third grade is a black hole _meta_end_dot_

 my girlfriend s kid went backwards last year _meta_end_dot_

 acquaintance but i m worried about academics _meta_end_exclamation_

 me obviously not too much otherwise you wouldn t have your kid in public school _meta_end_dot_

 acquaintance but you have your kids in public school _meta_end_dot_

 me yes and the administrators don t like me much _meta_end_dot_

 and i home schooled last year because third grade stinks _meta_end_dot_

 and my kid is probably two years ahead in math _meta_end_dot_

 she won t learn a thing this year _meta_end_dot_

 acquaintance doesn t that bother you _meta_end_question_

 me it s a trade off _meta_end_dot_

 the private schools have their own problems as does home schooling _meta_end_dot_

 i can push academics at home _meta_end_dot_

 you could home school _meta_end_dot_

 acquaintance oh i could never do that _meta_end_dot_

 i d be crazy _meta_end_dot_

 but i did teach boy genius more math in one day than he learned all year _meta_end_dot_

 me yep _meta_end_dot_

 acquaintance i don t know what to do _meta_end_dot_

 i probably wasn t too supportive _meta_end_dot_

 in fact i know i wasn t _meta_end_dot_

 it s a crap shoot _meta_end_dot_

 some years a kid gets a fantastic teacher _meta_end_dot_

 sometimes the teacher is mean or hates boys or hates girls or is lazy and apathetic or is stupid _meta_end_dot_

 or and this is the case with third grade in texas the curriculum just stinks _meta_end_dot_

 no one wants to teach third grade _meta_end_dot_

 the year is spent teaching to the taks test and kids and teachers hate it _meta_end_dot_

 and while the happiest i ve been curriculum wise was this last year home schooling there are other trade offs _meta_end_dot_

 families have many choices to make _meta_end_dot_

 anyone who opines dogmatically about home schooling or public schools or private schools or parochial schools seems to have an ax to grind to me since all choices have positives and negatives _meta_end_dot_

 in some ways i resent the pressure _meta_end_dot_

 when i was a kid a parent s character wasn t called into question based on the schooling choice he made _meta_end_dot_

 well home schooling families seemed a little strange turns out they were just ahead of the curve everyone went to public school or catholic school _meta_end_dot_

 each year a bunch of rebels got kicked out of catholic school came over to public school and usually excelled at sports _meta_end_dot_

 that was the extent of choices _meta_end_dot_

 and i might have just been completely unaware but i don t recall many aspersions cast based on what school a kid went to _meta_end_dot_

 the bigger thing was the school district _meta_end_dot_

 not now _meta_end_dot_

 a good parent volunteers in a classroom so many hours per week _meta_end_dot_

 a good parent home schools _meta_end_dot_

 a good parent supports public school education _meta_end_dot_

 a good parent invests in their child s future with private school _meta_end_dot_

 in the scheme of life does it make a huge difference _meta_end_question_

 i really would like to know _meta_end_dot_

 because what i see in the grown kids is this there are good products out of every kind of education and the parents not the schools have everything to do with that _meta_end_dot_
