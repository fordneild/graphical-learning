  question i keep hoping for the best but planning for the worst assume obama the messiah wins in november and the democrats keep both the senate and the house _meta_end_dot_

 what will happen in the following _meta_number_ref_ years and what can i do as an individual now to prepare _meta_end_question_

 this would not involve fleeing to the mountains _meta_end_dot_

 i have two young kids love my house and have no desire to retreat or surrender rohan answer adam smith once said that there is a great deal of ruin in a nation if barack gets in i suspect we ll get to see that first hand _meta_end_dot_

 would it be good for the country _meta_end_question_

 no _meta_end_dot_

 would it be pleasant for conservatives _meta_end_question_

 no _meta_end_dot_

 but if the country can survive jimmy carter and lyndon johnson i m sure it can survive barack obama _meta_end_dot_

 with that in mind the best advice i can give to conservatives if barack wins is _meta_number_ref_ don t opt out of the political system in frustration opt in _meta_end_dot_

 it s the people who opt in who make a difference _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ strongly support conservative candidates organizations new media outlets and causes _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ work to get the primary system fixed so that independents don t end up deciding who our nominee is again in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_
