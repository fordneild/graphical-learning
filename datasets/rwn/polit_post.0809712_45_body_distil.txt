  keystone cops the keystone cops was a series of silent film comedies featuring a totally incompetent group of policemen new jersey republican county chairman _meta_end_dot_

 keep incompetent and comedy and just substitute policemen with new jersey republican county chairman and you just described the current status of nj gop leadership in the state of new jersey _meta_end_dot_

 i have never been more frustrated and embarrassed at being a new jersey republican luckily i m a conservative so i have nothing to do with these people then i am now _meta_end_dot_

 this race is becoming a joke nationally within the republican party across the country blogs are having a field day and conservative organizations are laughing at the nj gop establishment as they fall over each other trying to recruit the latest rich moderate candidate into the race _meta_end_dot_

 the tipping point of years of frustration and angst is the us senate race and the disgraceful conduct and behavior of many of the gop county chairman and the chairman of the nrsc senator john ensign _meta_end_dot_

 let me state this immediately for those who say i m a frustrated murray sabrin supporter while that is true i m equally frustrated and feel bad for state senator joe pennacchio just as i do for murray sabrin _meta_end_dot_

 not about other candidates entering exiting reentering whatever into the race because as far as i am concerned until the filing deadline comes and goes the door is open _meta_end_dot_

 what i am frustrated at is how these candidates are entering the race by that i mean the way the county chairman have recruited and given these candidates organizational lines without meeting vetting or discussing positions with these candidates _meta_end_dot_

 one couldn t answer a question on the _meta_number_ref_nd amendment one never made it to jersey since he announced his candidacy all the while having a dwi charges of unprofessional behavior and a sealed arrest in florida to answer for and the newest candidate isn t even in the country and no one can state his position on any issue with _meta_percent_ref_ certainty _meta_end_dot_

 yet each of these candidates have been given endorsements from various county gop establishments official county lines and promises of support _meta_end_dot_

 why _meta_end_question_

 because they can self fund that s why have an arrest so what don t know what it means to be pro gun ahhh don t worry no one will care donate to democrats shhhh we won t tell drink a little to much hey it s washington you ll fit right in _meta_end_dot_

 at least estabrook went in front of these people to talk and lobby for their support _meta_end_dot_

 i m so tired of hearing that whatever the faults of these candidates are they are still better than frank lautenberg and that s probably true because any good democrat would be a republican anyway and any good republican would be a conservative but that doesn t make what s been going on right _meta_end_dot_

 check out the commish over at conservatives with attitude _meta_end_exclamation_
