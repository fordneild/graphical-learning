  an excerpt in an article called lapd plan to map muslim communities angers some groups caught my attention a plan by the lapd counterterrorism bureau to create a map detailing the muslim communities in that city was reported friday to be angering civil rights groups _meta_end_dot_

 at least three major muslim groups and the american civil liberties union sent a letter thursday to top city officials raising concerns about the plan the new york times reported _meta_end_dot_

 for the lapd or any police department to assume that one group is more terrorist or violent than another because of their religion alone that s a very scary phenomenon in our country a muslim advocate group representative said _meta_end_dot_

 ehr _meta_end_dot_

 one group is more terrorist or violent than another because of their religion alone and that group would be muslims _meta_end_dot_

 that doesn t mean all muslims are terrorists _meta_end_dot_

 they re not _meta_end_dot_

 that doesn t mean all muslims are bad people _meta_end_dot_

 they re not _meta_end_dot_

 that doesn t mean that muslims are the only people that commit terrorism _meta_end_dot_

 they re not _meta_end_dot_

 but let s just say it like it is if allah were real and he called home every muslim on the planet to heaven where they would spend eternity cavorting with virgins _meta_percent_ref_ of the terrorism happening back here on earth would immediately cease _meta_end_dot_

 since that s true since muslims commit almost all of the terrorism currently occurring on the planet if you re concerned about terrorism you are concerned about muslims _meta_end_dot_

 what we need in this county is for muslim advocate group s to stop pretending that people are picking on them and to start addressing the problems inside their own house _meta_end_dot_
