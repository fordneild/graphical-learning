  a blogger over at redstate did a fairly detailed analysis of how many delegates each candidate is likely to come out of super tuesday with _meta_end_dot_

 i haven t double checked all of his figures so i can t vouch for what he has said down the line but it sounds reasonably in line with other estimates i ve seen _meta_end_dot_

 long story short mccain _meta_number_ref_ romney _meta_number_ref_ huckabee _meta_number_ref_ now that may not seem like such a big lead but given the situation it s actually huge _meta_end_dot_

 why so _meta_end_question_

 nationally mccain is going into super tuesday with enormous momentum and probably about an _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ point lead on romney in the national polling _meta_end_dot_

 after super tuesday he s going to have a large delegate lead even more momentum an even larger lead nationally and lots of people saying the race is over _meta_end_dot_

 so even if huckabee dropped out at that point mitt would still be in an enormous hole _meta_end_dot_

 but there are still some big states left right _meta_end_question_

 yes but and this is a big but a lot of them have open primaries and are not winner take all _meta_end_dot_

 a reader email over at the campaign spot explains why mitt would have such an uphill climb the romney strategy is to stay close on super tuesday and then have conservatives coalesce around mitt _meta_end_dot_

 but if romney is as is quite likely at least _meta_number_ref_ delegates down after super tuesday the success of such a strategy assumes that romney wins most of the delegates the rest of the way so he can beat mccain to _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 to accomplish that romney needs lots of primaries closed to non gop voters and he d want them to be winner take all so he could scoop up large caches of delegates _meta_end_dot_

 however on march _meta_number_ref_ ohio texas and rhode island hold open primaries that are not winner take all _meta_end_dot_

 that s a target rich environment for mccain _meta_number_ref_ delegates at stake you don t have to be republican to vote and even if mccain loses he still gets a share of the delegates _meta_end_dot_

 similarly on may _meta_number_ref_ north carolina and indiana will elect _meta_number_ref_ delegates in open non winner take all primaries _meta_end_dot_

 and a number of other states still to come also have open non winner take all primaries washington wisconsin and nebraska _meta_end_dot_

 to put it simply romney s strategy assumes that even though he just lost a closed primary to mccain in florida and even though he hasn t won a contested state so far where his father wasn t once governor starting with the washington and kansas primaries this saturday he s going to start routing mccain by such massive proportions in one state after another that mccain can t win a war of attrition _meta_end_dot_

 ain t gonna happen _meta_end_dot_

 the sort of battle mitt would have to fight would be long expensive and against the tide which is why i think it s particularly notable that i don t hear the romney campaign saying that they re in it until the convention _meta_end_dot_

 obviously mitt s thinking about calling it quits and if huckabee doesn t drop out soon i wouldn t be surprised if mitt decides not to throw any more good money after bad _meta_end_dot_

 if huck does drop out mitt will probably hang around long enough to at least see how the polls shake out but i haven t seen any indications that huckabee s voters would migrate over to mitt en masse or vice versa _meta_end_dot_

 if mitt drops out huck does a little poll watching himself and then he makes a decision about whether staying in until the convention will work out to his benefit or not _meta_end_dot_

 what does that mean _meta_end_question_

 it means that this race could very well be over by the end of this week _meta_end_dot_
