  the feds seized indymac the loosey goosey mortgage lender indymac will reopen fully on monday as indymac federal bank under federal deposit insurance corp supervision but tensions ran high as customers at a branch at its los angeles area headquarters read a notice in the window saying it was closed _meta_end_dot_

 at another branch down the road a man who said he had more than _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ in an account twice what is normally fdic guaranteed argued with a security guard who was closing up _meta_end_dot_

 but these are desperate times for people with too much money in the wrong bank and such irrationality is not really funny _meta_end_dot_

 i wish i could have _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ to put in a bank but if i did i bet i d be pretty distraught over the prospect of half of it perhaps going underwater with the speculative real estate market _meta_end_dot_

 he need not worry however our congress is forever committed bipartisan like and with great humility solemnity and profundity to perpetuating nay ratcheting up its policy of classic moral hazard and will make sure that more money from the trough is found to fork over and above any stated fdic insurance limit _meta_end_dot_

 because it is only money _meta_end_dot_

 your money _meta_end_dot_
