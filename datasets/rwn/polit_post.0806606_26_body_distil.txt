  via rachel lucas comes this story from britain britain s first safe text street has been created complete with padded lampposts to protect millions of mobile phone users from getting hurt in street accidents while walking and texting _meta_end_dot_

 around one in ten careless brits has suffered a walk n text street injury in the past year through collisions with lampposts bins and other pedestrians _meta_end_dot_

 given the apparent dangers of unprotected text over a quarter of brits _meta_number_ref_ per cent are in favour of creating a mobile motorway on britain s pavements _meta_end_dot_

 texters could follow a brightly coloured line which would act like a cycle lane steering them away from obstacles _meta_end_dot_

 and _meta_number_ref_ per cent of those surveyed wanted pads placed on lampposts to protect them while texting _meta_end_dot_

 the study found that busy city streets were the worst for walk n text accidents _meta_end_dot_

 the research showed that brick lane in east london was the top spot for texting injuries _meta_end_dot_

 now brick lane has been made the country s first safe text street with brightly coloured padding similar to that used on rugby posts placed on lamp posts to test if it helps protect dozy mobile users _meta_end_dot_

 if the trial is successful the idea could be rolled out to other london blackspots it goes without saying that this is an amazingly stupid idea that treats adults like small children who can t even walk down the street without slamming into a lamppost _meta_end_dot_

 but that s not the point of this post _meta_end_dot_

 the point is that this reminds me of a true story from college _meta_end_dot_

 one day at college my roommates and i had just finished dinner and were walking back into our dorm _meta_end_dot_

 as we were going through the lobby we noticed this girl _meta_end_dot_

 the girl in question was a heartbreakingly beautiful student from brazil _meta_end_dot_

 i mean perfect face great body great hair i m talking a _meta_number_ref_ on a _meta_number_ref_ scale _meta_end_dot_

 all _meta_number_ref_ of us were checking her out but one of my roomies was just staring at her hard core as we walked _meta_end_dot_

 in fact he was paying so much attention to her that he walked face first right into a pole in the middle of the lobby without slowing up one iota _meta_end_dot_

 he hit the pole so hard that he dropped like a sack of potatoes to the floor and of course we showed our support for our buddy by pointing and laughing uproariously at him while the whole lobby full of people stared at him _meta_end_dot_

 to the best of my knowledge there was no physical damage to my roommate from walking into the pole but for all i know he may be on a psychologist s couch right now going and then they all laughed me _meta_end_exclamation_

 they all laughed _meta_end_exclamation_

 i see it every night when i dream _meta_end_exclamation_

 people laughing and staring reminding me of that story may be the one good thing that comes out of the brits public romper room experiment _meta_end_dot_
