  how dare we judge a woman who has had _meta_number_ref_ children by five men who lives on welfare takes the kids to some _meta_number_ref_rd world country leaves one _meta_number_ref_ year old daughter in the care of an old guy and the daughter winds up dead _meta_end_question_

 in an article about how bad it is to be a british kid what explains the nonjudgmental attitude among elites _meta_end_question_

 the reluctance to criticize fiona mackeown might be an expression of sympathy for someone in the throes of grief however foolishly or worse she behaved she certainly did not deserve the murder of her daughter _meta_end_dot_

 furthermore the guardian and observer journalists might argue we do not know enough about the details of her life to criticize her fairly _meta_end_dot_

 perhaps she is a good mother in most respects perhaps her children apart from the drug addict and the murdered scarlett are happy and will lead lives of fulfillment and achievement _meta_end_dot_

 after all no style of upbringing guarantees success or for that matter failure and therefore we should suspend judgment about her _meta_end_dot_

 i suspect however that the main consideration inhibiting elite criticism of mackeown is that passing judgment would call into question the shibboleths of liberal social policy for the last _meta_number_ref_ or _meta_number_ref_ years beliefs that give their proponents a strong sense of moral superiority _meta_end_dot_

 it would be to entertain the heretical thought that family structure might matter after all along with such qualities as self restraint and self respect and that welfare dependency is unjust to those who pay for it and disastrous for those who wind up trapped in it _meta_end_dot_

 theodore darlymple concludes the british government thus pursues social welfare policies that encourage the creation of households like the matthews and then seeks via yet more welfare spending to reduce the harm done to children in them _meta_end_dot_

 but was the matthews household poor in any but an artificial sense _meta_end_question_

 at the time of shannon s current stepfather s arrest the household income was _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ it lived free of rent and local taxes and it boasted three computers and a large plasma screen television _meta_end_dot_

 would another _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ or _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ or _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ have made any difference _meta_end_question_

 a system of perverse incentives in a culture of undiscriminating materialism where the main freedom is freedom from legal financial ethical or social consequences makes childhood in britain a torment both for many of those who live it and those who observe it _meta_end_dot_

 yet the british government will do anything but address the problem or that part of the problem that is its duty to address the state encouraged breakdown of the family _meta_end_dot_

 if one were a marxist one might see in this refusal the self interest of the state employee class social problems after all are their raison d tre _meta_end_dot_

 so children in britain suffer from emotional lack and material indulgence _meta_end_dot_

 this is a deadly combination _meta_end_dot_

 not only that but the elites refuse to hold the parents responsible for this disastrous mix _meta_end_dot_

 expecting parents to work or women to stop at one or two men etc _meta_end_dot_

 is simply not done because it would call into question liberal policies and ethics or lack thereof _meta_end_dot_

 it pays to be irresponsible and reckless _meta_end_dot_

 it pays in america too _meta_end_dot_

 there is a good way to change this bad behavior _meta_end_dot_

 stop underwriting it with tax payer dollars _meta_end_dot_

 remove the incentive to live licentiously and reinforce the behavior that s desired _meta_end_dot_

 part of me would also like to punish parents who have rotten kids _meta_end_dot_

 i know that s not always fair _meta_end_dot_

 still in my short time on this earth i have yet to see bad seeds but i have seen loads of bad parents _meta_end_dot_

 and they always seem shocked when their precious offspring become satan s foot soldiers _meta_end_dot_

 and another thing being a single parent is no excuse _meta_end_dot_

 michael phelps was raised my his mom _meta_end_dot_

 he and his sisters turned out fantastic they are a credit to her dedication _meta_end_dot_

 but she worked and she was committed to something she loved education and they learned by her example _meta_end_dot_

 even in less than ideal circumstances children can succeed _meta_end_dot_

 but someone has to care _meta_end_dot_

 it s time to throw out the nonjudgmental post modern nonsense that there are no absolutes and no ideals _meta_end_dot_

 it is time to judge and heap scorn upon the parents who produce these rotten kids _meta_end_dot_

 it is also time to stop reinforcing bad behavior of the parents _meta_end_dot_

 children deserve better _meta_end_dot_

 and when children are deprived of what they really need society ends up paying a steep price _meta_end_dot_
