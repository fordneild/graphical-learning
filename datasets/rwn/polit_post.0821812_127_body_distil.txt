 you re dodging urine and feces in the streets of denver later this month _meta_end_dot_

 poo and pee dominated a public hearing monday on a new law that prohibits people from carrying certain items if they intend to use them for nefarious purposes _meta_end_dot_

 the law crafted in advance of the democratic national convention was adopted unanimously by the city council _meta_end_dot_

 but not before a hearing laced with comedy and profanity _meta_end_dot_

 representatives from some of the groups planning large scale protests during the dnc this month said the ordinance was unnecessary and accused city officials of fear mongering _meta_end_dot_

 the intent of this ordinance is to try to smear protesters and make them look as if they are somehow criminal or somehow going to engage in some kind of gross conduct said glenn spagnuolo an organizer with the re create _meta_number_ref_ alliance _meta_end_dot_

 the ordinance makes it illegal to carry certain items such as chains padlocks carabiners and other locking devices _meta_end_dot_

 it also prohibits the possession of noxious substances _meta_end_dot_

 two of the most frequently used examples of a noxious substance are a bucket of urine and a feces bomb i m sorry but if you throw urine or feces at someone you deserve to be on the business end of some good old fashioned police brutality _meta_end_dot_

 you re not supposed to be able to say that _meta_end_dot_

 you re not supposed to be able to admit that some people just need to be severely beaten but we would be a better society if beating people who deserved it was more legally and societally accepted _meta_end_dot_

 for one thing nobody would be thinking about throwing poo and pee at people going to a national political convention _meta_end_dot_
