  question since mccain has all but wrapped up the republican nomination assuming he is voted in as president what kind of judges do you think he would appoint _meta_end_question_

 the real legacy of any presidency is the measure of the judicial appointments _meta_end_dot_

 the reforms that reagan managed to pass were wiped out by succeeding administrations and even though welfare reform was passed under clinton it can come back at any date _meta_end_dot_

 however the judges that were appointed will sit for life _meta_end_dot_

 this issue should be paramount since judge stevens arguably the driving force behind the leftward march of the supreme court isn t likely to last through another presidential term _meta_end_dot_

 who knows what other judges will retire in the meantime _meta_end_dot_

 consider who knew during the _meta_number_ref_ campaign that not one but two supreme court positions would need to be filled _meta_end_dot_

 everything else that bush has done or not done aside the appointments of alito and scalia to the bench were victories for conservatism the_mutant answer first of all before i answer this it s worth noting that either hillary or obama would appoint ultra left wing judges so anybody mccain appoints is likely to be better _meta_end_dot_

 that being said the key question is whether mccain would appoint conservative judges _meta_end_dot_

 the evidence that says he won t reliable accounts have mccain saying that he would be happy to appoint the likes of chief justice roberts to the supreme court _meta_end_dot_

 but he indicated he might draw the line on a samuel alito because he wore his conservatism on his sleeve mccain has previously said that he opposes overturning roe v _meta_end_dot_

 wade he has changed his tune since and originalist judges are not going to support parts of mccain feingold _meta_end_dot_

 so can you really trust john mccain to appoint a _meta_number_ref_th originalist judge to the court when that could mean that roe v _meta_end_dot_

 wade and his signature legislation mccain feingold may be deep sixed as a result _meta_end_question_

 the evidence that says he will mccain has been publicly telling anyone who ll listen that he will appoint judges like alito and roberts _meta_end_dot_

 after the enormous dogfight over harriet miers mccain is going to be very aware especially given the promises he has made over judges that he will pay an extremely heavy political price for picking a judge who isn t acceptable to conservatives _meta_end_dot_

 so what does that all add up to _meta_end_question_

 my best guess is that mccain would probably appoint originalist judges but with a guy like john mccain who has made a career out of sticking it to the right in the end there are simply no absolute guarantees that can be made on any conservative issue _meta_end_dot_
