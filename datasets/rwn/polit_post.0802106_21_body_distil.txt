  last week end was pretty grim for conservatives _meta_end_dot_

 duncan hunter who admittedly was already out of it officially dropped out of the race and fred thompson finished in third place in south carolina which barring a miracle knocks him out of the running _meta_end_dot_

 i know that s tough for some people to hear but you gotta understand _meta_end_dot_

 fred skipped new hampshire nevada and michigan all of which he bombed in in order to compete in south carolina _meta_end_dot_

 south carolina is a state that s extremely friendly to conservatives _meta_end_dot_

 south carolina is a state that s extremely friendly to southerners _meta_end_dot_

 fred had the money to run ads and spent more time in south carolina after iowa than any of the other candidates _meta_end_dot_

 after all of that fred only pulled _meta_percent_ref_ of the vote which was barely good enough for third place and less than half the percentage of the vote that mccain pulled in and this was fred s last opportunity to win a state before super tuesday _meta_end_dot_

 moreover even in the pre south carolina polls fred was in _meta_number_ref_th place in florida and _meta_number_ref_th place nationally and it seems highly unlikely that he can improve his prospects significantly after coming up way short in a state that was practically tailor made for a fred win _meta_end_dot_

 ps given that fred s support is probably down to hard core conservatives at this point fred may stay in to help out his buddy john mccain _meta_end_dot_

 normally a candidate would help out another candidate in this situation by dropping out and endorsing him _meta_end_dot_

 but given that fred s supporters are mostly hard core conservatives and very unlikely to vote for mccain whether fred endorses him or not fred can help his friend john mccain more by just staying in the race through super tuesday and peeling off some conservatives who would probably be inclined to vote for anyone but mccain _meta_end_dot_
