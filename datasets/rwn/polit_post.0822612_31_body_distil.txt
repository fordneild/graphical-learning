  a relative enrolled their child in a drowning prevention class _meta_end_dot_

 she is five months old and can float now and save herself _meta_end_dot_

 go watch this video as a parent it is absolutely frightening to watch _meta_end_dot_

 i have mixed emotions _meta_end_dot_

 on the one hand of course children should be taught to swim as young as possible _meta_end_dot_

 it s a non negotiable at my house not only because we have a pool but because i just believe that all children should know how to swim and at a young age _meta_end_dot_

 they also need to know how to rescue someone else because so many children drown trying to save a friend or sibling _meta_end_dot_

 still does training like this give parents and families a false sense of security _meta_end_dot_

 the child in the video was clearly fatiguing _meta_end_dot_

 the training buys a parent precious minutes but does it make tragic events more likely because parents or care takers are less vigilant _meta_end_question_
