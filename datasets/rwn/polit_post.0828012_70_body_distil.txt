  currently there are _meta_number_ref_ democrats _meta_number_ref_ republicans and _meta_number_ref_ independents who caucus with the dems in the senate _meta_end_dot_

 that means the dems need _meta_number_ref_ more seats to get to _meta_number_ref_ which would allow them to shut down any republican filibuster attempts at will _meta_end_dot_

 at the moment the situation is particularly precarious for the gop _meta_end_dot_

 mccain is down by _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ points nationally the gop s spineless capitulation on the bailout has taken the wind out of conservative sails and the political environment is still slanted heavily against the republicans _meta_end_dot_

 just to give you an idea of how bad it is there doesn t appear to be a single seat held by the dems in the senate that s seriously in jeopardy _meta_end_dot_

 however the same can t be said on the gop side _meta_end_dot_

 here s how i am currently assessing the gop s senate prospects seats that look safe aren t included _meta_end_dot_

 republican seat strongly leaning democrat takeover jim gilmore r va vs _meta_end_dot_

 mark warner d republican seat leaning democrat takeover i ted stevens r ak vs _meta_end_dot_

 mark begich d i john sununu r nh vs _meta_end_dot_

 jeanne shaheen d republican seat that s a toss up i elizabeth dole r nc vs _meta_end_dot_

 kay hagan d republican seat that s leaning towards retention i norm coleman r mn vs _meta_end_dot_

 al franken d i saxby chambliss vs _meta_end_dot_

 jim martin d as you can see the democrats look likely to pick up at least _meta_number_ref_ seats right now _meta_end_dot_

 that could easily be _meta_number_ref_ if liddy dole doesn t get going _meta_end_dot_

 her numbers have dropped considerably over the past few weeks _meta_end_dot_

 furthermore the gop seats in colorado and minnesota are leaning the right way today there is a star tribune poll showing franken ahead but their polls are always ridiculously skewed to the left but that could easily change by election day _meta_end_dot_

 worse yet if mccain were to drop further as opposed to making up a little ground it s not out of the question that the democrats could win all of these seats _meta_end_dot_

 that would be very unlikely but it s possible _meta_end_dot_

 my best guess today _meta_end_question_

 a _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ seat pick up for the dems _meta_end_dot_

 although that wouldn t get the dems to _meta_number_ref_ all it would take to stop a filibuster would be _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ squishes refusing to go along _meta_end_dot_

 anything over a _meta_number_ref_ seat majority has the potential to be big trouble for the gop if obama makes it to the white house and the dems are almost guaranteed to hit that number and then some _meta_end_dot_
