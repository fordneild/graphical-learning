  today s manufactured outrage of the day is that on a mid day fox news program featuring megyn kelly and michelle malkin debating the impact of michelle obama on the race the production assistant in charge of writing chyrons dubbed the would be first lady obama s baby mama apparently this is a racial slur which suggests that she and obama aren t actually married and the children are illegitimate and therefore they should just head on back to africa _meta_end_dot_

 or something like that _meta_end_dot_

 salon s alex koppelman has the most linked story about this on memeorandum and he s got a video of the segment and the above screencap which i ve appropriated _meta_end_dot_

 otherwise he s in just the facts ma am mode _meta_end_dot_

 his colleague joan walsh is more apoplectic bringing out the _meta_number_ref_s catchphrase oh no they didn t to show her hip displeasure _meta_end_dot_

 where do you even start when criticizing fox s slur _meta_end_question_

 do you try to explain that baby mama is slang for the unmarried mother of a man s child and not his wife or even a girlfriend _meta_end_question_

 are they racist or just clueless _meta_end_question_

 isn t there racism even in their cluelessness if somebody didn t know what baby mama means but used it anyway _meta_end_question_

 even at fox won t somebody have to apologize _meta_end_question_

 am i wasting my time even thinking about that _meta_end_question_

 yes actually _meta_end_dot_

 oliver willis helpfully suggests hey fox news just call her a n_meta_beep_ref_ and be done with it okay so here s the thing because during this campaign i m apparently learning that we black people have our own secret code and hand signals so this stuff has to be explained like you are speaking to a child at times using the phrase baby mama to describe this woman implies that like too many people in the black community she is a mother on her own with no man around doing his job _meta_end_dot_

 except barack and michelle obama are the exact opposite of this and that is one of the reason america especially black america are so proud of them _meta_end_dot_

 they ve raised their children _meta_end_question_

 electing them to the white house is the least we can do _meta_end_exclamation_

 michelle malkin who was on air at the time and has nothing to do with writing the obama s baby mama chyron that appeared below her doesn t know what s up with that _meta_end_dot_

 i don t know if the caption writer was making a lame attempt to be hip clueless about the original etymology of the phrase or both _meta_end_dot_

 but i do know that it was michelle obama herself who referred to barack as her baby s daddy and has used the phrase baby daddy to describe barack while on the stump this year _meta_end_dot_

 i m going with both malkin also provides a helpful link to a two year old slate piece with the awkward headline that explains that celebrity gossip rags have seized upon baby daddy and baby mama two useful terms that have long appeared in hip hop and r b lyrics and are slowly stripping them of their emotional fangs apparently such black luminaries as tom cruise and keven federline had been referred to as baby daddy even though they were married to the mother of their child _meta_end_dot_

 so perhaps fox was secretly signaling that the obamas are scientologists _meta_end_question_
