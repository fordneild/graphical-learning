  this moronic woman should have no case because this is certainly not a violation of her first amendment rights fatuma hassan has just enough rice in her near empty cupboards to make it through the month _meta_end_dot_

 the anger she felt when she lost her job in may has given way to a dull nagging hunger _meta_end_dot_

 yet this soft spoken _meta_number_ref_ year old became an unlikely hero within the somali community when she and five of her muslim co workers were dismissed last month from the mission foods tortilla factory in new brighton minn for refusing to wear a new company uniform a shirt and pants they consider a violation of their islamic beliefs _meta_end_dot_

 for me wearing pants is the same as being naked hassan said noting the prophet mohammed taught that men and women should not dress alike _meta_end_dot_

 my culture my religious beliefs are more important than a uniform religious discrimination complaints nationally have nearly doubled since the sept _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ terrorist attacks a reflection some argue of the heightened state of anxiety and fear concerning muslims _meta_end_dot_

 in minnesota muslims filed _meta_number_ref_ religious discrimination cases with the u s _meta_end_dot_

 equal employment opportunity commission in _meta_number_ref_ up from just eight in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 the eeoc does not break down this data by ethnicity _meta_end_dot_

 and many of the more publicized disputes in the area including target cashiers who declined to scan pork and cabdrivers refusing to transport passengers with alcohol never made it to an eeoc filing _meta_end_dot_

 this rule about pants is not congress prohibiting the free exercise of religion it s not anti muslim and it s not aimed at anyone s religion _meta_end_dot_

 it s probably just a common sense rule designed to insure work place safety _meta_end_dot_

 you wear a long flowing skirt on a factory floor you may end up tangled up in a machine _meta_end_dot_

 as for the cashiers who won t ring up pork or the cabdrivers who won t transport people with alcohol that s part of their job _meta_end_dot_

 for example target sells pork products _meta_end_dot_

 if you re a cashier at target you re going to have to ring those products up _meta_end_dot_

 if you feel that s impossible for you because of your religion then you can either _meta_number_ref_ ignore your religious beliefs and do it anyway _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ create your own store where they don t sell pork products _meta_end_dot_

 the same goes for the somali woman in the tortilla factory _meta_end_dot_

 she can wear the pants quit the job or start her own specially designed tortilla company where wearing pants isn t a problem _meta_end_dot_

 heck if she wanted she could even mount a publicity campaign to try to get the company to change its policy _meta_end_dot_

 christians do that sort of thing all the time _meta_end_dot_

 but what she shouldn t be able to do is legally force the company to change the way it does business just to accommodate her religious beliefs _meta_end_dot_

 given how many religions we have in this country and how litigious the population is allowing that to happen would open up an enormous can of worms that we d never be able to get closed _meta_end_dot_

 hat tip to michelle malkin for the story _meta_end_dot_
