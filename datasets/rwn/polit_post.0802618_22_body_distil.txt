  democrats who apparently support barack obama are becoming angrier and more vocal by the day in their condemnation of bill and hillary clinton _meta_end_dot_

 first up for your reading pleasure is jonathan chait at the los angeles times with is the right right on the clintons _meta_end_question_

 something strange happened the other day _meta_end_dot_

 all these different people friends co workers relatives people on a liberal e mail list i read kept saying the same thing they ve suddenly developed a disdain for bill and hillary clinton _meta_end_dot_

 maybe this is just a coincidence but i think we ve reached an irrevocable turning point in liberal opinion of the clintons _meta_end_dot_

 the sentiment seems to be concentrated among barack obama supporters _meta_end_dot_

 going into the campaign most of us liked hillary clinton just fine but the fact that tens of millions of americans are seized with irrational loathing for her suggested that she might not be a good democratic nominee _meta_end_dot_

 but now that loathing seems a lot less irrational _meta_end_dot_

 we re not frothing clinton haters like _meta_end_dot_

 well name pretty much any conservative _meta_end_dot_

 we just really wish they d go away _meta_end_dot_

 the big turning point seems to be this week when the clintons slammed obama for acknowledging that ronald reagan changed the country _meta_end_dot_

 everyone knows reagan changed the country _meta_end_dot_

 bill and hillary have said he changed the country _meta_end_dot_

 but they falsely claimed that obama praised reagan s ideas saying he was a better president than clinton something he didn t say and surely does not believe _meta_end_dot_

 this might have been the most egregious case but it wasn t the first _meta_end_dot_

 before the new hampshire primaries clinton supporters e mailed pro choice voters claiming that obama was suspect on abortion rights because he had voted present instead of no on some votes _meta_end_dot_

 in fact the president of the illinois chapter of planned parenthood said she had coordinated strategy with obama and wanted him to vote present recently there have been waves of robocalls in south carolina repeatedly attacking barack hussein obama _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 the clinton campaign is trying to make it seem as if the complaint is about negativity and it is pointing out that obama has criticized hillary as well _meta_end_dot_

 that s what politicians are supposed to do when they compete for votes _meta_end_dot_

 but criticism isn t the same thing as lying and sleaze mongering _meta_end_dot_

 am i starting to sound like a clinton hater _meta_end_question_

 it s a scary thought _meta_end_dot_

 mind you chait quickly draws back from the horrifying thought that conservatives might have been right about the clintons all along by reassuring himself that the attacks clinton made on conservatives back when bill clinton was having his bimbo eruption monica lewinsky perjury problem were surely well founded _meta_end_dot_

 yet he admits what has finally become obvious to him but the conservatives might have had a point about the clintons character _meta_end_dot_

 bill s affair with monica lewinsky jeopardized the whole progressive project for momentary pleasure _meta_end_dot_

 the clintons gleefully triangulated the democrats in congress to boost his approval rating _meta_end_dot_

 they do seem to have a feeling of entitlement to power _meta_end_dot_

 if hillary wins the nomination most of us will probably vote for her because the alternative is likely to be worse _meta_end_dot_

 but what happens if she s embroiled in another scandal _meta_end_question_

 will liberals rally behind her or will they remember the democratic primary _meta_end_question_

 next up for your reading pleasure from bruce feirstein at vanity fair bill clinton nasty man time to face an inconvenient truth bill clinton is running for a third term _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 in watching bill clinton s latest mini meltdown on cnn set off by a reporter asking him to comment on a complaint by the former head of the south carolina democratic party that the _meta_number_ref_nd president was engaging in the politics of deception used by the late and much reviled republican strategist lee atwater clinton s response offered an unusual lens into the powder keg that is our former commander in chief starting with an almost jocular dismissal of the accusation he then proceeded to wind himself up into a finger pointing fury attacking barack obama painting himself as the victim and generally blaming the press for everything before walking away with the taunt shame on you it was not well presidential _meta_end_dot_

 by now we ve all seen the clinton ground game in south carolina and can pretty much map out the dance steps anticipating a loss hillary scoots out of town her minions start downplaying the importance of the contest at least until they get called on it and have to unwind the spin while bill trots around south carolina like some kind of thuggish company hit man attacking obama s character provoking him on race dissembling about his record and attempting to diminish and dismiss the appeal of obama s candidacy by predicting that he ll win because of the black vote _meta_end_dot_

 ergo he s a single constituency candidate _meta_end_dot_

 and the goal is to triangulate him into oblivion _meta_end_dot_

 it s the same old clinton game over and over the iowa caucuses were important until they weren t south carolina was key until they were going to lose _meta_end_dot_

 there is no yesterday that can t be rewritten there is no consideration about the blowback from all this tomorrow _meta_end_dot_

 the only thing that matters is winning or appearing to win at no matter what cost today _meta_end_dot_

 for me the most damning part of this week s mini meltdown wasn t the lecture about the media being at fault for everything or even the seemingly offhanded passive aggressive swipe that when he put out a hit job on me at the same time he called her the senator from punjab i never said a word _meta_end_dot_

 and i don t care about it today _meta_end_dot_

 i m not upset about it because for me the really damning thing was a series of sentences he uttered just before the punjab remark referring to complaints about the clinton campaign in nevada it s okay _meta_end_dot_

 and we re not hung up about it _meta_end_dot_

 and we won anyway _meta_end_dot_

 we fought hard _meta_end_dot_

 and we won in other words we are running for president _meta_end_dot_

 not hillary _meta_end_dot_

 not the junior senator from new york _meta_end_dot_

 but we bill and hillary in a de facto end run around the _meta_number_ref_nd amendment _meta_end_dot_

 watching the democrats debate in south carolina i was struck by the heated i m here _meta_end_dot_

 he s not exchange between senators obama and clinton because it so perfectly encapsulates the problem with the two clintons bill is out there with a shiv presumably with the full countenance of his wife while hillary deftly manages to avoid being held accountable for him or taking any responsibility herself _meta_end_dot_

 and therein lies my real issue should this hydra headed candidacy succeed bill clinton will always be there _meta_end_dot_

 he ll always be larger than life _meta_end_dot_

 and if the last few weeks have demonstrated anything we ll never know who s really calling the shots _meta_end_dot_

 from where i sit in california where senator clinton is currently ahead in the polls bill clinton s behavior over the past fortnight has struck me as sordid and undignified _meta_end_dot_

 and his de facto back door attempt to retake the presidency is nothing short of unseemly _meta_end_dot_

 the epiphany on the left is all fun to watch but i have a few reservations _meta_end_dot_

 the most important of them is that democrats who are slowly coming to hate the clintons are doing exactly what the left does all too well in recent years they hate _meta_end_dot_

 they hate _meta_end_dot_

 they burn with hate _meta_end_dot_

 they are furious _meta_end_dot_

 the list of people they deeply loathe is wide and deep _meta_end_dot_

 it goes on and on and on _meta_end_dot_

 president george w _meta_end_dot_

 bush _meta_end_dot_

 vice president dick cheney _meta_end_dot_

 attorney general john ashcroft _meta_end_dot_

 attorney general alberto gonzales _meta_end_dot_

 paula jones _meta_end_dot_

 independent counsel kenneth starr _meta_end_dot_

 secretary of state condoleeza rice _meta_end_dot_

 rick santorum _meta_end_dot_

 karen hughes _meta_end_dot_

 karl rove _meta_end_dot_

 tom delay _meta_end_dot_

 rush limbaugh _meta_end_dot_

 sean hannity _meta_end_dot_

 newt gingrich _meta_end_dot_

 ann coulter _meta_end_dot_

 bill o reilly _meta_end_dot_

 dennis hastert _meta_end_dot_

 mitch mcconnell _meta_end_dot_

 paul wolfowitz _meta_end_dot_

 lynne cheney _meta_end_dot_

 donald rumsfeld _meta_end_dot_

 general david petraeus hatred is so easy for today s left _meta_end_dot_

 and it s not minor dislike it s total loathing _meta_end_dot_

 the left is strong in hate _meta_end_dot_

 so finally belatedly and only when it suits their immediate political interest in electing barack obama some dems hate the clintons _meta_end_dot_

 they finally understand what they deliberately chose not to understand when their embarrassment of a president embarrassed the nation _meta_end_dot_

 but the left is still missing the most important part of what conservatism has to offer _meta_end_dot_

 they ve missed out on the optimism the realistic hope and the belief in the competency of individuals that is at the heart of conservatism _meta_end_dot_

 they don t understand _meta_end_dot_

 they don t understand that every human being has the spark of excellence that there is such a thing as a soft bigotry of low expectations that no child should be left behind or need be left behind that no child should be sucked down an abortionist s sink that every life is precious that _meta_percent_ref_ to _meta_percent_ref_ of adults are perfectly capable of supporting themselves without handouts and that government is not the answer to every problem _meta_end_dot_

 they don t understand that our best days are still ahead of us that america is still a shining beacon of hope to the world and a city on a hill whose light cannot help but shine to the farthest corners of the world that free markets work and that freedom is america s strength _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 they still understand little or none of this _meta_end_dot_

 many of them haven t been to church synagogue or other place of worship in years if ever _meta_end_dot_

 many of them hate the church too _meta_end_dot_

 if there is a religious imperative against carrying smoldering embers of hate within one s chest _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ they are unaware of it _meta_end_dot_

 has the left always been this filled with hate _meta_end_question_

 i don t think so _meta_end_dot_

 martin luther king jr _meta_end_dot_

 tried to teach a form of nonviolent resistance that specifically involved repaying unkindness with decency _meta_end_dot_

 i can t speak to that era entirely so i won t _meta_end_dot_

 i ll give the left the benefit of the doubt that in its past there were plenty of moments of charity compassion forgiveness tolerance and decency _meta_end_dot_

 but where has it gone _meta_end_question_

 today the passion of the left is reserved for hate _meta_end_dot_

 today s angry left finally sees the clintons pattern of deceit but does it know anything of the alternative _meta_end_question_

 those on angry left are mired in their cesspool of hate compounded by a large does of hopelessness and despair _meta_end_dot_

 nobody can live that way for long _meta_end_dot_

 when democrats held the congress and the presidency or at least one of the branches they could get by _meta_end_dot_

 angry democrats were still filled with hate but at least they felt they had a measure of power and could try to improve the world in the way that they understood it _meta_end_dot_

 if obama wins the nomination don t look for any changes on the left _meta_end_dot_

 but in the more likely event that hillary clinton wins the nomination there will be an agonizing turning point _meta_end_dot_

 democrats who have realized who the clintons are will have to decide to support hillary clinton and turn the full force of their hatred back on the right again _meta_end_dot_

 but can they _meta_end_question_

 a mind once stretched doesn t always fit back into its previous container _meta_end_dot_

 it will be interesting to see how this struggle on the left between hatred and optimism between denial and realization plays out _meta_end_dot_
