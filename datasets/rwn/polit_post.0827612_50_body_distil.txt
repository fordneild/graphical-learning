  former democratic congresswoman and green party presidential candidate cynthia mckinney is in the news again because she claimed that the government murdered _meta_number_ref_ people during katrina dumped their bodies in a swamp and then covered it up _meta_end_dot_

 in the wake of hurricane katrina i had a woman i ve never really said this in public out loud in front of a lot of cameras and there s a lot of cameras in this room now _meta_end_dot_

 i had a mother to call me because her son had a very gruesome task _meta_end_dot_

 her son s charge by the department of defense was to process _meta_number_ref_ bodies that had received a single bullet wound to the head and these were mostly males _meta_end_dot_

 and her son was afraid to talk because he signed a silence agreement _meta_end_dot_

 so he only complained to his mother _meta_end_dot_

 but the date about these individuals was entered into a pentagon computer and then reportedly the bodies were dumped in a swamp in louisiana _meta_end_dot_

 this is as a result of the tragedy of hurricane katrina _meta_end_dot_

 now i have no no i have verification from insiders who wish to remain anonymous at the red cross that this is true _meta_end_dot_

 i suspect that these were prisoners _meta_end_dot_

 and so you know this investigation of the whole prison industrial complex is extremely important _meta_end_dot_

 and it should not end with just a question of the nature of prisons in our country but these five thousand souls also need some justice too cynthia mckinney here s the video if you can t believe that even cynthia mckinney could say something this dumb so _meta_number_ref_ people were killed by the government during katrina _meta_end_dot_

 well rather than shooting holes in this myself let me just quote ed morrissey over at hot air wouldn t the families of these _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ prisoners wonder what happened to them _meta_end_question_

 and which prisoners specifically have not been accounted for _meta_end_question_

 at least a few names of people who were in louisiana state custody before katrina and then not in custody afterwards would provide a starting point for any investigation _meta_end_dot_

 and it s possible to lose a few bodies in the louisiana swamps but not even that legendary territory could hide _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ of them at once without a few of the locals taking notice _meta_end_dot_

 the really disturbing thing about this sort of conspiracy mongering is that it has become so commonplace that few people seem immune to it anymore _meta_end_dot_

 for god s sake this is a person who s supposed to be one of our best and brightest she s a former democratic congresswoman and yet she s a drooling loon _meta_end_dot_

 want to know what s really sad _meta_end_question_

 there are probably at least a dozen other people in congress who are just as mentally challenged as cynthia mckinney and guess what _meta_end_question_

 as long as they re in office they ll be ferociously supported by the democrats protected by the mainstream media and voted back in by their constituents _meta_end_dot_

 in fact the only reason cynthia mckinney isn t in congress today is because bizarrely republicans could vote in the primary in her district and they took an anybody but mckinney stance _meta_end_dot_

 that s the nature of the beast these days _meta_end_dot_

 if you re crazy enough you just might end up helping to run the country _meta_end_dot_
