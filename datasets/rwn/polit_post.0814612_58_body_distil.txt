  the iron lady i regret that if my referencing that moment of trauma for our entire nation and in particular the kennedy family was in any way offensive _meta_end_dot_

 i certainly had no intention of that whatsoever the former first lady said _meta_end_dot_

 we see now it was not merely a matter of the truth which never stood in the way of the message _meta_end_dot_

 it is simply that she does not care at all about the content of anything she says except whether or not it will have the desired political effect _meta_end_dot_

 that of course is a formula that is inherently self defeating but when you lack sensitivity _meta_end_dot_

 when you do not care _meta_end_dot_

 when you just do not get it _meta_end_dot_

 you defeat yourself _meta_end_dot_

 cross posted on likelihood of success _meta_end_dot_
