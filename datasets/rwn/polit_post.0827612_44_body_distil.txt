  it s painfully obvious that someone who s writing a book called the breakthrough politics and race in the age of obama especially one that is supposed to come out on inauguration day has no business moderating a vice presidential debate _meta_end_dot_

 moreover the fact that she didn t tell the commission on presidential debates about the book tells you everything you need to know about gwen ifill s ethics or more aptly her lack of ethics _meta_end_dot_

 again it should be painfully obvious that if you re writing a book called the breakthrough politics and race in the age of obama that s something you might want to reveal to the people who are deciding whether you re the right person to moderate a debate featuring obama s vice president _meta_end_dot_

 topping all of this off was ifill s sleazy attempt to play the race card ifill questions why people assume that her book will be favorable toward obama _meta_end_dot_

 do you think they made the same assumptions about lou cannon who is white when he wrote his book about reagan said ifill who is black _meta_end_dot_

 asked if there were racial motives at play she said i don t know what it is _meta_end_dot_

 i find it curious know what i find curious _meta_end_question_

 that ifill is still being allowed to moderate the debate and for that matter that she still has a job at pbs after this _meta_end_dot_

 quite frankly she deserves to be fired for this kind of ethical breach _meta_end_dot_

 ps the only bright side to this is that the mccain campaign can now use ifill s obvious bias as a talking point after the debate _meta_end_dot_

 if palin does well it s even more impressive since the moderator was obviously favoring biden _meta_end_dot_

 if she doesn t do well what can you expect with gwenn ifill trying to help biden _meta_end_question_
