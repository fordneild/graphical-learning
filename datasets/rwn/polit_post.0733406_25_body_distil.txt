  question last night s youtube debate again highlighted cnns bias toward the democratic party by asking about issues that democrats care about but republicans generally place those issue much lower _meta_end_dot_

 do you anticipate another youtube debate after the primaries when it is the democrats vs _meta_end_dot_

 the republicans canddmf answer i hope it s not the last youtube debate because the problem with the debates was cnn not youtube _meta_end_dot_

 cnn chose to do an ad from a snowman in the first debate and a dick cheney cartoon in the _meta_number_ref_nd debate not youtube _meta_end_dot_

 cnn chose to allow a hillary plant not just to ask a question but to go on a diatribe from the audience _meta_end_dot_

 it s not youtube s fault that cnn allowed that to happen _meta_end_dot_

 cnn chose to ask a question about the confederate flag and the do you believe every word in this book guy not youtube _meta_end_dot_

 cnn chose to waste _meta_number_ref_ minutes at the start of the debate introducing the candidates _meta_end_dot_

 cnn chose to allow the crowd to boo and cheer instead of telling them to stay quiet _meta_end_dot_

 cnn chose to allow the candidates to go over time regularly without having their moderators do much of anything about it _meta_end_dot_

 in other words every problem with the debate was cnn s fault not the fault of youtube _meta_end_dot_

 so will there be another youtube debate _meta_end_question_

 i don t know but i d like to see another one particularly if they re partnered with a network other than cnn _meta_end_dot_

 ps i d also add that as a general rule i don t think having democrats ask questions via video was a big deal _meta_end_dot_

 if the question is good it doesn t matter if it comes from a republican or a democrat _meta_end_dot_

 now it s a different story if they allow the questioner to actually show up and comment like they did with the gay general but if a john edwards supporter wants to ask a question about abortion or a former cair intern wants to ask about muslims it s not a big deal to me _meta_end_dot_
