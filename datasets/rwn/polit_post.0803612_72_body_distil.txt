  tomorow very very early in the morning i m going to be hitting the road and heading to cpac _meta_end_dot_

 although i will be doing updates for rwn and cg from cpac on thursday and friday they will probably be less frequent than normal and largely centered around cpac _meta_end_dot_

 so i will have a crew of guest bloggers taking up the slack while i am hobnobbing with being brushed off by the creme de la creme of the conservative movement as i pester them for interviews and pics _meta_end_dot_

 the supplemental guest blogger schedule will be posted later tonight _meta_end_dot_
