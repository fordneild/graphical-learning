  usually i start this type of story out with i bet you think this was found in the credentialed media or i wonder if the cm will cover this or something to that effect and the story comes from a source such as operation iraqi freedom in this case the main newspaper component of the credentialed media the new york times actually is the one writing the story _meta_end_dot_

 when these stories do appear in the times it is usually saturday and i have the theory that that happens because all the editors start their martini weekends early friday after a long week of bashing bush america mccain republicans etc _meta_end_dot_

 but to appear in the sunday edition _meta_end_question_

 impressive the militia that was once the biggest defender of poor shiites in iraq the mahdi army has been profoundly weakened in a number of neighborhoods across baghdad in an important if tentative milestone for stability in iraq _meta_end_dot_

 would we have seen a story like that just _meta_number_ref_ months ago _meta_end_question_

 certainly not on page a _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 and certainly not describing the mahdi army which the credentialed media seemed to be rooting for as a criminal enterprise later in the article _meta_end_dot_

 it is a remarkable change from years past when the militia led by the anti american cleric moktada al sadr controlled a broad swath of baghdad including local governments and police forces _meta_end_dot_

 but its use of extortion and violence began alienating much of the shiite population to the point that many quietly supported american military sweeps against the group _meta_end_dot_

 ok so the times can t quite give credit to the united states military and the surge _meta_end_dot_

 liberals are still liberals _meta_end_dot_

 prime minister nuri kamal al maliki struck another blow this spring when he led a military operation against it in baghdad and in several southern cities _meta_end_dot_

 he did _meta_end_question_

 while i do not want to take credit away from maliki has the times heard of the surge _meta_end_question_

 it is part of a general decline in violence that is resonating in american as well as iraqi politics senator john mccain argues that the advances in iraq would have been impossible without the increase in american troops known as the surge while senator barack obama who opposed the increase says the security improvements should allow a faster withdrawal of combat troops _meta_end_dot_

 it is fun how clueless liberals are _meta_end_dot_

 i guess it is only john mccain who says the surge which the times cannot even capitalize has been the main cause of the decline in violence and the mahdi army _meta_end_dot_

 sigh _meta_end_dot_

 reality based community _meta_end_dot_

 and barry like any good liberal worth his weight in arugula uses the security improvements as a means to call for redeployment _meta_end_dot_

 the changes are not irreversible _meta_end_dot_

 the security gains are in the hands of unseasoned iraqi soldiers at checkpoints spread throughout baghdad s neighborhoods _meta_end_dot_

 and local government officials have barely begun to take hold of service distribution networks potentially leaving a window for the militia to reassert itself _meta_end_dot_

 the iraqi s are almost there _meta_end_dot_

 very close _meta_end_dot_

 just a little more time _meta_end_dot_

 after all that we and the other coalition forces have done isn t it worth it to give just a bit more time to the endpoint rather then washing our hands of it _meta_end_question_

 or do democrats really want a replay of our exit from vietnam _meta_end_question_

 but getting beyond the biases of the grey lady the times should be shown a little bit of kudos for printing an article that shows that the surge has worked things are coming together in iraq and the end point ie a stable iraq with a democratically elected government and a military and police force which can stand on their own is almost here _meta_end_dot_

 even the associated press thinks the us is winning a war that was once lost at least lost in their minds and michael totten defines victory in iraq _meta_end_dot_

 as seen at pirate s cove _meta_end_dot_
