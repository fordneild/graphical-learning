  why aren t they happy _meta_end_question_

 i mentioned it before but i m going to clarify it is obscene that congressmen and senators preen for the cameras over this legislation _meta_end_dot_

 if the legislation was even necessary it was a necessary evil _meta_end_dot_

 it was dirty business signifying a dismaying trend in american culture and american voters were not happy about it even if they thought it was the right thing to do _meta_end_dot_

 to see chris dodd chris dodd _meta_end_exclamation_

 of all people and now nancy pelosi gloat is sickening _meta_end_dot_

 these pompous windbags wonder why they are loathed _meta_end_dot_

 this is why _meta_end_dot_

 all americans are paying now for the people and businesses who live beyond their means _meta_end_dot_

 see the little guy is screwed _meta_end_dot_

 he might declare bankruptcy but no one is bailing him out _meta_end_dot_

 but big business and the sticky fingered government that helped create this problem are getting bailed out _meta_end_dot_

 and they brag _meta_end_dot_

 do they realize that every self congratulatory word they spout will be replayed if this money gamble doesn t work _meta_end_question_

 oh right i forgot _meta_end_dot_

 the press will cover their butts and blame bush for signing it into law _meta_end_dot_
