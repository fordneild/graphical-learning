  question why do you think is newt gingrich and pat robertson making these stupid green themed psa type commercials with the likes of pelosi and sharpton _meta_end_question_

 mr _meta_end_dot_

 meaner answer like the _meta_percent_ref_ of you people i do not think global warming is caused by man nor do i think newt who actually has a brain or robertson a man of very little brain believe that either _meta_end_dot_

 the thing is republicans are being stupid about the whole environmental debate and letting the argument be defined by the latest trend which is global warming or now the more p c _meta_end_dot_

 term climate change _meta_end_dot_

 the leftists who are spouting off about it frame the issue like republicans don t care or want to kill baby seals for sport _meta_end_dot_

 who doesn t care about the environment _meta_end_question_

 i mean really _meta_end_dot_

 most people think it s a good idea to clean up after themselves and to not take more than needed and to share etc _meta_end_dot_

 conservatives especially christian conservatives support measures for good environmental stewardship _meta_end_dot_

 the admonishment by god to adam and eve holds true humans have a responsibility to dress and to keep the environment and the animals in their care _meta_end_dot_

 and conservatives do just this by recycling conserving where possible etc _meta_end_dot_

 just like democrats do _meta_end_dot_

 i think that republicans need to stop allowing themselves to be defined as earth hating animal abusing neanderthals _meta_end_dot_

 and newt gingrich recognizes this _meta_end_dot_

 so while a conservative s answer to what it means to care for the environment might be different than a liberals that doesn t mean he doesn t care _meta_end_dot_

 newt seems to be wanting to take away the issue from the left and he s got the right idea _meta_end_dot_

 robertson _meta_end_question_

 he s just a crazy old man _meta_end_dot_
