  this morning i got up at _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ am to make it to the president s _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ am speech you re supposed to be there _meta_number_ref_ hours early _meta_end_dot_

 there was a huge mob waiting in line when i got there at a little after _meta_number_ref_ am but very little was happening beyond the secret service perusing the area _meta_end_dot_

 it took a while to even find the media entry and the people didn t seem to know how we were supposed to get in there _meta_end_dot_

 but eventually they just told us to go with the flow and i hooked up with a reporter from frontlinemag and we just barged our way to the front of the line and got in _meta_end_dot_

 despite the confusion we got pretty decent seats by about _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ am _meta_end_dot_

 i was next to some college students who literally left their hotels at _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ am and got there at _meta_number_ref_ am _meta_end_dot_

 they were jacked up out of their minds to hear the president speak in fact i think most people were pretty excited _meta_end_dot_

 the crowd cheered each person who walked onto the stage to sit down the crowd cheered the placement of the presidential seal on the podium they even cheered the guy who put bush s note on the podium _meta_end_dot_

 then when bush finally spoke he got a raucous welcome the crowd just loved him _meta_end_dot_

 it was sort of a legacy why it s so important we have a republican president in _meta_number_ref_ speech _meta_end_dot_

 i got the whole thing on video it ran about _meta_number_ref_ minutes so i ll probably just post a mash up on monday _meta_end_dot_

 ps michael steele is wildly popular _meta_end_dot_

 he was on the stage and got the biggest round of applause for the morning other than the one the president received _meta_end_dot_

 it s too bad they didn t make him the rnc chairman _meta_end_dot_

 he could have made a real difference _meta_end_dot_
