  _meta_number_ref_ people who say they re spiritual but not religious what does that even mean _meta_end_question_

 that you hope heaven is like a pass fail class in college and that by saying you re spiritual but not religious you ll be doing the bare minimum to get in the pearly gates _meta_end_question_

 does it mean you want the comfort of thinking god is in your corner without it getting in the way or your hedonistic lifestyle _meta_end_question_

 sorry but it doesn t work that way and people who think it does are kidding themselves _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ hollywood stars talking about political issues sure celebrities have a right to political opinions no matter how bubbleheaded they are just like everybody else but they don t have a right to be taken seriously or a right to demand that people go see their films despite the fact that they ve just offended them with their obnoxious rhetoric _meta_end_dot_

 someone needs to alert the celebs to this fact _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ people who play their bass way too loud if i can hear the bass from your stereo when you drive by my house a block away it s too loud _meta_end_dot_

 play it loud if you like but at least turn the bass down so that you don t annoy everyone you drive past _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ needless meetings i ve never been cut out for life in a corporation _meta_end_dot_

 i don t suffer fools gladly i don t like taking orders and i have always had a loathing of pointless meetings usually because i got so bored i couldn t hold my eyes open _meta_end_dot_

 i ve never quite gotten the point of having an hour long meeting to talk about a subject that could be easily covered in a two sentence email but it was the bane of my existence in the business world _meta_end_dot_

 i would constantly nod off in these meetings and i got to be an expert at leaning over a certain angle and strategically placing my hands so that whatever boring manager was running the meeting couldn t tell i was zoning out until my mouth dropped open or i started to fall over which has happened many many times over the years _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ people who stand in your way with their carts when you re in a wal mart food lion or some other store that has precisely enough room for two carts to go through an aisle why would you absent mindedly block the whole lane and then stand there staring vacantly at a can of peas while you are blocking my path _meta_end_question_

 i hate having to ask people to move out of the way _meta_end_dot_

 they should be aware enough of their surroundings to just do it _meta_end_dot_

 it s common courtesy _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ people who don t control their bratty children when you re walking through a store and some kid is making such a racket running tearing things up screaming or generally making such a pain of himself that you d like to backhand him out of his shoes it s just stunning to see the kids parents standing there _meta_end_dot_

 usually if the parent sees you giving them the angry stare they ll give the kid a now johnny you behave that you know they don t mean they know that they don t mean and the kid knows that they don t mean _meta_end_dot_

 good grief people get control of your children or don t take them out in public _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ conspiracy theories there are wacko conspiracy theories about pretty much anything and everything these days which makes no sense if you think about it _meta_end_dot_

 after all how often are the conspiracy theories right _meta_end_question_

 almost never _meta_end_dot_

 you could simply disregard every conspiracy theory that anyone put forth and you d be right like _meta_number_ref_ times out of a _meta_number_ref_ so shouldn t that produce a little more skepticism _meta_end_question_

 _meta_number_ref_ telemarketers spammers junk mail how did we end up being constantly badgered to buy products we don t want and didn t ask for via mail phone and email _meta_end_question_

 i know i know capitalism and all that but still it s annoying and it literally costs the rest of us billions of dollars so that a bunch of jerks can hawk unsolicited crap that _meta_number_ref_ _meta_percent_ref_ of the public doesn t want _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ trashing people right after they die unless you re talking about an enemy of our country like castro or osama bin laden you should show some respect for the dead along with their families and friends _meta_end_dot_

 what s wrong with saying something nice about a person who just died or if you can t even do that refraining from saying something nasty about him until the body is in the ground _meta_end_question_

 that s just basic human decency _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ cell phone jerks sure they re great for emergencies but all in all cell phones are an overall negative to society _meta_end_dot_

 know why _meta_end_question_

 i ll tell you why cell phone jerks _meta_end_dot_

 they re why your preacher has to tell people to turn off their cell phones before the service starts _meta_end_dot_

 they re the people swerving into the lane because they re too busy paying attention to their conversation to watch the road _meta_end_dot_

 they re the people who not only get a phone call in a theater but actually take the call and talk through the movie _meta_end_dot_

 can these people just not wait _meta_number_ref_ minutes to talk about whatever earth shattering revelation from their cousin bebe or their boyfriend jimmy jo bob _meta_end_question_
