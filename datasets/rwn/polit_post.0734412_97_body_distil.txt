  numerous people have noted that religion has played a surprisingly large role in _meta_number_ref_ primaries _meta_end_dot_

 is that because mike huckabee is a former pastor _meta_end_question_

 huckabee certainly has brought up christian issues on more than a few occasions but he s not really the man primarily responsible for putting religious issues front and center in the campaign _meta_end_dot_

 what about mitt romney then _meta_end_question_

 is it a reaction to the fact that he s a mormon _meta_end_question_

 perhaps but mitt has at least partially brought that on himself by so explicitly trying to cater to christian conservatives _meta_end_dot_

 granted mitt is trying to appeal to christian conservatives because he s worried that they might reject him for being a mormon but they re also looking more closely at his religious views because he s attempting to appeal to them on those grounds _meta_end_dot_

 so it s sort of a catch _meta_number_ref_ for him _meta_end_dot_

 however the guy who s really responsible is rudy giuliani _meta_end_dot_

 but he s pro abortion he s soft on gay marriage and he has done very little to try to appeal to social conservatives so how can he have made religion a big issue in the campaign _meta_end_question_

 well that s just it because rudy would represent such a radical change from the standard republican standard bearer he s causing people to take a hard look at some fundamental assumptions that have been made by the gop over the last couple of decades _meta_end_dot_

 one of those assumptions is that the republican candidate needs to cater to social conservatives to win the primary _meta_end_dot_

 if rudy were to win it would be a sign that you don t need to even pay lip service to christian conservatives to get the nomination which would mean in effect that social conservatives are toothless _meta_end_dot_

 with that in mind it s not surprising that social conservatives have started talking more about what they want in a candidate so that they can find an anybody but rudy candidate to rally around _meta_end_dot_

 so if you don t like all this excessive focus on religion you can blame rudy giuliani for it _meta_end_dot_
