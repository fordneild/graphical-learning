  on the upside biden is an old washington hand he has foreign policy experience he s feisty which is a good trait for a vp and he s a better speaker than people give him credit for _meta_end_dot_

 on the other hand he doesn t deliver a state to obama he s extremely liberal he s a real blowhard and he s primarily known for plagiarism and gaffes like i mean you got the first mainstream african american obama who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy and you cannot go to a _meta_number_ref_ eleven or a dunkin donuts unless you have a slight indian accent all in all biden is probably an inferior pick to someone like sam nunn or hillary clinton who would have delivered a lot more votes but he will help balance out obama s inexperience naivete and lack of competence which is what barack desperately needs right now _meta_end_dot_
