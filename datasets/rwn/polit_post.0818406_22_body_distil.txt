  i don t know how many times i saw the video in this post while i was in the navy _meta_end_dot_

 it is a very important part of u s _meta_end_dot_

 naval history _meta_end_dot_

 not once in all those viewings did i ever hear anyone claim that john mccain was responsible for the fire _meta_end_dot_

 now i have _meta_end_dot_

 a free republic user warned of a smear campaign by lane anderson of vietnam veterans against the war _meta_end_dot_

 lane he said was making the claim that john mccain started the uss forrestal fire _meta_end_dot_

 after a little searching i found this more important than marital issues is his competance in military matters _meta_end_dot_

 google uss forrestal fire john mccain to learn more about the pilot that lost five planes and set a supercarrier on fire _meta_end_exclamation_

 if you click the link you can see it is lane anderson _meta_end_dot_

 say what you want about john mccain but he didn t start the forrestal fire _meta_end_dot_

 via the chief of naval information it is not a story about just a few individuals _meta_end_dot_

 or ten _meta_end_dot_

 or twenty _meta_end_dot_

 or fifty _meta_end_dot_

 it is the story of hundreds of officers and enlisted men who were molded by disaster into a single cohesive force determined to accomplish one mission save their ship and their shipmates _meta_end_dot_

 it is the story of the acts of heroism they performed acts so commonplace accomplished with such startling regularity that it will be impossible to chronicle all of them _meta_end_dot_

 it will be impossible for a very simple reason all of them will never be known _meta_end_dot_

 mccain iii said later he heard a whooshy sound then a low order explosion in front of him _meta_end_dot_

 suddenly two a _meta_number_ref_s ahead of his plane were engulfed in flaming jet fuel jp _meta_number_ref_ spewed from them _meta_end_dot_

 a bomb dropped to the deck and rolled about six feet and came to rest in a pool of burning fuel _meta_end_dot_

 the awful conflagration which was to leave _meta_number_ref_ forrestal crewmen dead _meta_number_ref_ more injured and two missing and presumed dead had begun _meta_end_dot_

 i thought that the left had reached rock bottom when they made the claims that mccain had it easy in the hanoi hilton and collaborated with the enemy _meta_end_dot_

 i guess i shouldn t be surprised but i am _meta_end_dot_

 blaming him for the death of _meta_number_ref_ sailors is so far out there that it is beyond imagination _meta_end_dot_
