  well it only took a day or two _meta_end_dot_

 i m surprised how long it took actually _meta_end_dot_

 fred kaplan does an excellent job though of bringing the irrational rage and absolute venom of the left towards president bush to the fore regardless of what happens next it is worth asking what the bush people were thinking when they egged on mikheil saakashvili georgia s young western educated president to apply for nato membership send _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ of his troops to iraq as a full fledged u s _meta_end_dot_

 ally and receive tactical training and weapons from our military _meta_end_dot_

 did they really think putin would sit by and see another border state and former province of the russian empire slip away to the west _meta_end_question_

 if they thought that putin might not what did they plan to do about it and how firmly did they warn saakashvili not to get too brash or provoke an outburst _meta_end_question_

 you know this analysis deserves an analogy _meta_end_dot_

 so you re a woman married to an abusive jerk _meta_end_dot_

 you can t leave _meta_end_dot_

 finally you have a chance you divorce _meta_end_dot_

 you change your life but you can t move _meta_end_dot_

 you have kids together with the jerk so you have to stay around _meta_end_dot_

 one of the kids prefers abusive dad _meta_end_dot_

 you know what s best but what can you do _meta_end_question_

 you try to assert yourself _meta_end_dot_

 the ex though he s no nicer _meta_end_dot_

 it pisses him off that you dare defend yourself _meta_end_dot_

 he brings his gun over and he shoots you _meta_end_dot_

 attempts to kill you for having the nerve to defy him _meta_end_dot_

 and oh by the way he will show the others around where it s at too _meta_end_dot_

 he s above the law because he s crazy and everyone is afraid of him _meta_end_dot_

 most friends are outraged at this jerk s actions _meta_end_dot_

 he s wrong _meta_end_dot_

 he s abusive _meta_end_dot_

 he s vicious _meta_end_dot_

 but some people go after the woman for daring to believe she could be independent and assert herself _meta_end_dot_

 she should have known better _meta_end_dot_

 she should never have provoked him _meta_end_dot_

 stupid woman _meta_end_dot_

 she deserves what she got _meta_end_dot_

 and furthermore she s a complete idiot for listening to anyone who believed she could be independent _meta_end_dot_

 why does the left always always take the side of the abusive spouse _meta_end_question_

 while they should be protecting the rights of the woman to wear what she wants screw who she wants the left always blames the victim when it comes to freedom and sides with the aggressive oppressive dictatorial jerk _meta_end_dot_

 always _meta_end_dot_

 the most important thing kaplan says though is this in the long term the best way to take russia down a notch along with iran venezuela and other hostile powers overflowing with oil money is to pursue policies and fund technologies that slash the demand for oil _meta_end_dot_

 the georgia crisis should make clear if it isn t already that this is a matter of hard headed national security _meta_end_dot_

 how about blaming clinton for vetoing the drilling ten years ago _meta_end_question_

 oil dependence has given these world thugs power they don t deserve _meta_end_dot_

 slash demand _meta_end_question_

 how about increase our supply _meta_end_question_

 wait _meta_end_dot_

 wait _meta_end_dot_

 america is wrong _meta_end_dot_

 always _meta_end_dot_

 wrong _meta_end_dot_

 everything is america s fault _meta_end_dot_
