  question what is hillary really up to mike_m answer first of all i don t think hillary is going to try to swipe the nomination from obama _meta_end_dot_

 even if she could pull it off she would be widely viewed as having stolen the nomination from obama and the backlash would not only make it impossible for her to win the presidency it would destroy her political career _meta_end_dot_

 so i think what she d really like to do subtly is to impress as many people as possible hope obama loses to mccain and then capture the nomination in _meta_number_ref_ and become president _meta_end_dot_

 towards that end i don t think she s going to overtly sabotage obama but i think she will do just enough work on his behalf to keep up appearances while dragging her feet as much as possible _meta_end_dot_

 ps of course obama could get hillary fully on board by choosing her as his vp _meta_end_dot_
