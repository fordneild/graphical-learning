  i keep thinking that the misogyny and sexism can t get any worse or that it s isolated to the crazy extremists at du and kos but no _meta_end_dot_

 andrew sullivan leads the woman hating charge _meta_end_dot_

 alan colmes the guy liberals think is a softy for his affiliation with fox proved his lefty worth today _meta_end_dot_

 what is wrong with you lefties _meta_end_question_

 have you no shame whatsoever _meta_end_question_

 for more than a generation blacks women not a minority gays and other minorities have fought for respect and equal rights _meta_end_dot_

 that means this that a person is treated the same no matter their color or gender or sexual orientation _meta_end_dot_

 and here now supposed progressives savage not only sarah palin saying that she wasn t pregnant which is so ridiculously insane because it is so easily disproved but that her daughter was pregnant and hiding it _meta_end_dot_

 and her daughter has to see herself blown up in enlarged pictures and examined like a science project because conspiracy nuts are filled with such vicious hate that they don t mind ruining a child s life _meta_end_dot_

 sarah palin chose to run for office and ostensibly knew what nastiness awaited _meta_end_dot_

 if she were a woman blogger she d know for sure and wouldn t be surprised in the least _meta_end_dot_

 but her daughter did not choose this path and does not deserve this disgusting callousness _meta_end_dot_

 and andrew sullivan gives this bullsh t credence _meta_end_question_

 i delinked him two years ago but i cannot believe that i ever thought he was remotely sane _meta_end_dot_

 he has no shame whatsoever _meta_end_dot_

 none _meta_end_dot_

 as a gay man you d think he d have some notion of what it s like to be a minority and to be hated for that alone _meta_end_dot_

 and here he is a major voice in the blogosphere putting forth the worst sort of sexist misogynist bilge _meta_end_dot_

 i refuse to link him you ll have to go to the links above to read the crap he s writing the last three days have been the most shocking dismaying days blogging ever _meta_end_dot_

 i ve been so excited about the implications of a woman vice presidential nominee who reflects my values and my life experience wife mother career special needs child libertarian small government reformer etc and to see her treated so heinously feels personal _meta_end_dot_

 but what s worse is i imagine my daughter having to endure the kinds of things being said about palin s daughter and i want to beat the hell out of someone _meta_end_dot_

 this needs to stop _meta_end_dot_

 the leftists need to stop _meta_end_dot_

 if they have any moral compass whatsoever they need to find it and reset it _meta_end_dot_

 updated i m still completely disgusted but with some sleep and some reading has come some humor _meta_end_dot_

 over at sundries shack there s this gem perish the thought _meta_end_dot_

 i m just having some fun here _meta_end_dot_

 unlike the other folks who have visited the shack looking for trig palin birth certificate sarah palin husband cheat and trig palin birth certificate for son _meta_end_dot_

 if that s what brought you here by the way you aren t worth a pound of rotten syphilitic donkey penis and i invite you kiss the whitest part of my ass _meta_end_dot_

 that s not the christian way of putting it but i don t imagine that decent folk will mind the sentiment _meta_end_dot_

 also i wish on you a case of kidney stones that last a month and feel like satan s darning needle when you pass them _meta_end_dot_

 that about sums up my not so charitable thoughts _meta_end_dot_

 and just when i get in a better mood i read this at ann althouse _meta_end_dot_

 the big topic today _meta_end_question_

 why it s world changing leftist tripe sarah palin s earrings _meta_end_dot_

 and of course there s more andrew sullivan this time making fun of dumb hick sarah _meta_end_dot_

 again you ll have to get it via ann _meta_end_dot_

 i refuse to link him _meta_end_dot_

 updated again i go down and then up and then down now up again _meta_end_dot_

 mark steyn elucidates why there s so much to like about sarah palin i ll give you a taste but go read the whole thing first governor palin is not merely as jay describes her all american but hyper american _meta_end_dot_

 what other country in the developed world produces beauty queens who hunt caribou and serve up a terrific moose stew _meta_end_question_

 as an immigrant i m not saying i came to the united states purely to meet chicks like that but it was certainly high on my list of priorities _meta_end_dot_

 and for the gun totin miss wasilla then to go on to become governor while having five kids makes it an even more uniquely american story _meta_end_dot_

 next to her resume a guy who s done nothing but serve in the phony baloney job of community organizer and write multiple autobiographies looks like just another creepily self absorbed lifelong member of the full time political class that infests every advanced democracy _meta_end_dot_

 updated again you know how i said this kos rumor is so stupid and easily refutable _meta_end_question_

 yeah well lookie here a very pregnant sarah palin who looks awesome by the way _meta_end_dot_

 the woman is _meta_number_ref_ after all _meta_end_dot_
