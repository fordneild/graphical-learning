  this week end as i was reflecting on the crankiness of the conservative movement and how unhappy so many people still are with the gop despite their improved performance since _meta_number_ref_ i wondered what it would take to get people right back on the same page again _meta_end_dot_

 regrettably it occurred to me that it will probably take hillary clinton getting elected and ramming through something that is so offensive to conservatives that it will make them realize that they have much bigger issues with the left than they do with the right _meta_end_dot_

 that might mean amnesty for illegal aliens socialized medicine allowing iran to obtain nuclear weapons or appointing liberal judges to the supreme court who will put overturning roe v _meta_end_dot_

 wade out of reach perhaps forever _meta_end_dot_

 all i can say is that conservatives and americans have a lot to lose if the democrats have another great year in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 so we better start to think about that before it s too late and the dems inflict irreversible damage on this country that the right will still bemoan _meta_number_ref_ years from now _meta_end_dot_
