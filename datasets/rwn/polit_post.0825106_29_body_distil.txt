  don t feel too bad if you don t know that richard greene has a radio show called clout _meta_end_dot_

 it s on air america which means of course that the title is pretty ironic even if it isn t meant that way _meta_end_dot_

 greene is one of those lefties who cannot fathom any reasoned basis for disagreement with his political faith and therefore writes tired cliched and barely readable pieces such as the psychopathology of the republican to demonstrate to himself and his vast audience that the half of the country that doesn t see things his way is mentally ill _meta_end_dot_

 yeah mentally ill and this coming from no less than a _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ truther and assassination conspiracy loon _meta_end_dot_

 so far nothing newsworthy here _meta_end_dot_

 in fact though greene a former lawyer is a professional communications coach and his website tells you twice in the first _meta_number_ref_ words that he was crowned by the times of london the master of charisma that s gotta hurt someone indeed he does have a nice smile and a book _meta_end_dot_

 i should have gotten a free consultation in exchange for this ultra valuable plug the master of charisma also has a nice publicist the charming and straightforward leslie grant _meta_end_dot_

 and what is interesting is that the same greene who is after all an expert at speechifying has circulated via leslie a pretty interesting and arguably objective report card of psychopath per greene sarah palin s speech at the convention and it goes like this the sarah palin speech report card as greene predicted gov _meta_end_dot_

 sarah palin did indeed rock the house with her address _meta_end_dot_

 she instantly became a celebrity rock star much like sen _meta_end_dot_

 obama due to his speech at the _meta_number_ref_ convention and has changed the game for the _meta_number_ref_ general election _meta_end_dot_

 greene says that the speech accomplished _meta_number_ref_ things _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 solidified and energized the republican base _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 ratified john mccain s suspect judgment in picking her _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 made the republican ticket attractive to small town residents and women across the country who would not otherwise have participated in the election in any way _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 made a huge step forward in establishing her as ready to step into the oval office if that were necessary _meta_end_dot_

 there is still more work to be done on that front however _meta_end_dot_

 quality poise a connection to the crowd a toughness a warmth b substance b when talking about her life and family a d when discussing national and international policies c likability a ready to be commander in chief c up from a d before the speech overall grade a there are two possibilities here _meta_end_dot_

 one is that richard greene makes believe he s deranged bona fide radical left hatemonger because from such things people can sometimes make a living _meta_end_dot_

 note that this is a guy with a syndicated radio show and a blog on something akin at least conceptually to a national platform and he s circulating a press release to conservative bloggers instead of publishing the item himself _meta_end_dot_

 acknowledging sarah palin s merits could be bad for business _meta_end_dot_

 the other possibility is that the political richard greene is for real but the speechmaking and consulting hustler within him cries out truther like that sarah palin is _meta_end_dot_

 that good _meta_end_dot_

 cross posted on ron coleman s pretty good likelihood of success bloggy thingy _meta_end_dot_
