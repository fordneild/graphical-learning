  _meta_number_ref_ mike huckabee attacks romney s religion in an interview with the new york times magazine mike huckabee asked don t mormons believe that jesus and the devil are brothers why huckabee chose to give romney s supporters a chance to bash him for being anti mormon just for asking the question is unknown but the comment which huckabee later apologized for helped enable his detractors to paint him as a man exploiting his faith to help win an election _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ mitt romney saw his father march with martin luther king this is a bit of a strange controversy because romney s father certainly did participate in civil rights marches and there have also been people who have come forward and claimed to have seen george romney march with martin luther king _meta_end_dot_

 however romney certainly didn t see it he certainly didn t march with mlk personally as he has previously claimed and mitt s response to this flap certainly makes visions of bill clinton s infamous response from his _meta_number_ref_ grand jury testimony dance through your head _meta_end_dot_

 here s clinton it depends on what the meaning of the word is is now here s mitt the reference of seeing my father lead in civil rights and seeing my father march with martin luther king is in the sense of this figurative awareness of and recognition of his leadership _meta_end_dot_

 i ve tried to be as accurate as i can be _meta_end_dot_

 if you look at the literature or look at the dictionary the term saw includes being aware of in the sense i ve described oh yeah he definitely has a little clinton in him _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ obama s flag pin and national anthem flap in his quest to win the democratic primaries barack obama tried to reach out to the patriotism loathing netroots by making a big public show of not wearing a flag pin democratic presidential candidate barack obama says he doesn t wear an american flag lapel pin because it has become a substitute for true patriotism since the sept _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ terrorist attacks _meta_end_dot_

 obama then was photographed refusing to hold his hand over his heart during the national anthem _meta_end_dot_

 his response to that bizarrely was that some people were falsely claiming he didn t hold his hand over his heart during the pledge of allegiance when really it was the national anthem _meta_end_dot_

 of course you still hold your hand over your heart during the national anthem so the point was moot _meta_end_dot_

 long story short it looks like obama s unpatriotic true patriotism didn t poll as well as he thought it would _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ hillary s campaign says obama is a coke dealing muslim liar who has been lying since kindergarten in what may be the most grotesque display of dirty politics since the nixon administration hillary clinton s surrogates publicly and falsely suggested that obama might have been a coke dealer is secretly a muslim and that a kindergarten essay proved he had been lying about his desire to be president _meta_end_dot_

 had a republican engaged in the exact same tactics he would have been accused of being the worst sort of racist which incidentally will probably also be what happens to hillary clinton in certain quarters if her repulsive smear tactics enable her to beat obama in the democratic primaries _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ fred thompson skips new hampshire for leno on the day of his much anticipated entry into the race fred thompson chose to skip a new hampshire debate and instead introduced himself to the public on the tonight show with jay leno _meta_end_dot_

 that started him out on the wrong foot in new hampshire and he never recovered in that state _meta_end_dot_

 today he s running _meta_number_ref_th in new hampshire behind ron paul which means that if he bombs in iowa his campaign may be dead shortly after new hampshire finishes voting on january _meta_number_ref_th _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ southern fried hillary in what was really a backhanded slap at black men bill clinton was called the first black president a label that he readily latched onto for political purposes _meta_end_dot_

 well when his charisma challenged wife tried to pick up where he left off in a black church in alabama the result was a horrible southern accent of the sort you d expect to hear at a new york party as they tried to imitate an inbred hillbilly yokel _meta_end_dot_

 it sounded something like this iiiiiii don t feel noways tired _meta_end_dot_

 i come too fahrr from where i started frum iii culd have listened all afternuune _meta_number_ref_ john edwards running feud with ann coulter ann coulter was roundly and rightly slammed for calling john edwards a f ggot at cpac last year _meta_end_dot_

 unfortunately for john edwards instead of ignoring it he tried to hype it for the sake of publicity and fundraising which not only caused ann coulter to continue to go after him but led to lots of conversations that went about like this person _meta_number_ref_ ann coulter was wrong to call john edwards a f ggot _meta_end_dot_

 person _meta_number_ref_ you re right _meta_end_dot_

 she should have just called him a little girl or silky pony _meta_end_dot_

 person _meta_number_ref_ or the breck girl _meta_end_dot_

 i mean he is pretty girlish _meta_end_dot_

 but oh that ann coulter she always goes too far _meta_end_exclamation_

 then edwards made the mistake of compounding his error by having his wife call in to attack coulter on hardball _meta_end_dot_

 that s really the way to convince people that you re not as much of a wimp as they think you are by sending your sick wife out to fight your battles for you _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ fred thompson s rejection of a constitutional amendment to ban abortion in the name of federalism fred thompson rejected a constitutional amendment to ban abortion on meet the press _meta_end_dot_

 at first glance that might seem to be a minor matter since there is no chance of getting it passed any time soon but that was the very moment that the bottom started falling out of his campaign as more than a few social conservatives slowly began the migration from him to huckabee _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ john edwards _meta_dollor_ref_ haircut let me ask the same question a voter asked him on the campaign trail senator i was just wondering since you re on this national poverty tour how do you justify spending _meta_dollor_ref_ on a haircut of course you don t and that has summed up the silliness of john edwards campaign _meta_end_dot_

 he s a pampered super wealthy lawyer who has built a whole campaign around being a supposed champion of little girls who can t afford a _meta_dollor_ref_ coat at wal mart _meta_end_dot_

 it sounds fake it is fake and people know it s fake _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ john mccain supports the senate amnesty bill at one point john mccain was considered the front runner for the gop nomination but his support for the incredibly unpopular amnesty bill in congress did so much damage to his campaign s poll numbers and fundraising that many political analysts wrote his campaign off for dead _meta_end_dot_

 since then because of the weakness of the field he has been able to climb back into contention but his continued support for amnesty is like a _meta_number_ref_ pound barbell tied to his back _meta_end_dot_

 if he doesn t get the nomination it ll be because of his support of amnesty _meta_end_dot_

 if he does get the nomination and goes on to lose in the general election it ll be because of amnesty _meta_end_dot_

 in other words the biggest hurdle standing between john mccain and the white house isn t his republican or democratic opponents it s his desire to make _meta_number_ref_ million fence jumping social security number swindling scofflaws into american citizens over the fervent protestations of most members of his own party _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ fred thompson gets in the race late for months and months fred thompson sat on the sidelines writing columns and doing radio appearances as his poll numbers went up _meta_end_dot_

 he thought with some justification that there wasn t much of a reason to officially declare his candidacy when he was becoming more popular without getting in the race _meta_end_dot_

 however on the other hand while fred was waiting the conservative media was picking other candidates to back top talent was signing on with other campaigns his supporters were starting to get impatient and expectations were building to super human heights _meta_end_dot_

 then when fred finally jumped in the race in september of this year he was mercilessly savaged while he and his campaign got up to speed under a microscope _meta_end_dot_

 had he gotten in earlier say in july of this year there wouldn t have been as much scrutiny during that first month and he would also have probably raised more money than any other candidate in the third quarter which would have given him much needed cash and a sign that his campaign was for real as of yet thompson s campaign still hasn t recovered from the poor first impression that he made because he got in the race so late _meta_end_dot_

 that could turn out to be the difference between fred thompson the gop nominee and fred thompson the guy who was out of the race by the middle of january _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ hillary s drivers licenses for illegals flap the wicked witch of new york was cruising along looking inevitable when she mangled a question about drivers licenses for illegal aliens in what was probably the single worst debate performance for a top tier candidate this year _meta_end_dot_

 after that horrific performance obama started rising in the polls while hillary s campaign started making unforced errors and playing dirty _meta_end_dot_

 if hillary clinton doesn t capture the nomination that botched debate question will be the key moment that led to her defeat and even if she does become the democratic nominee the aftermath of that controversy has revealed to the gop how fragile hillary clinton really is when she s challenged _meta_end_dot_
