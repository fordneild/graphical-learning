  you are not seriously sitting out the election or voting for a democrat are you _meta_end_question_

 john hawkins as you ve read here is done _meta_end_dot_

 ace is flipping his lid too or perhaps it s simpler john mccain is unfailingly honorable if he acts in a way that seems to be dishonorable you must be perceiving it incorrectly because john mccain is unfailingly honorable _meta_end_dot_

 in fact i imagine he conceives that there s a great deal of integrity in his having the guts to tell the conservative troglodytes what they needed to hear in order to secure the nomination _meta_end_dot_

 i held off on this last night because i didn t know what to do _meta_end_dot_

 i guess my heart is with hawkins though my brain says morrissey s right _meta_end_dot_

 obama would be marginally i think worse than mccain _meta_end_dot_

 but obama hasn t really flat out lied to me _meta_end_dot_

 that counts for something _meta_end_dot_

 i admit it _meta_end_dot_

 john mccain is a liar _meta_end_dot_

 but i never believed him when he said that he d support security first anyway so i m not feeling betrayed _meta_end_dot_

 this whole election has been about plugging my nose and mustering the gumption to pull the damn lever _meta_end_dot_

 and for me it s still about that because i think about an obama presidency with a democrat congress and my skin starts erupting red blotches _meta_end_dot_

 ed morrissey doesn t think mccain lied exactly and disagrees with john and ace _meta_end_dot_

 he says does anyone believe that barack obama would be more committed to border security than john mccain _meta_end_question_

 not if they ve paid attention _meta_end_dot_

 obama is at best the same as mccain on immigration and more likely to acquiesce to democrats like dick durbin on another full blown amnesty _meta_end_dot_

 even if we consider that a wash where else does obama look better than mccain to conservatives _meta_end_question_

 i guess i just can t believe that republicans will want to be a party to that kind of destruction in america _meta_end_dot_

 obama will usher in a time of carter like prosperity and as a business owner that makes me want to curl up into the fetal position and suck my thumb _meta_end_dot_

 do you guys really think a democrat would be better _meta_end_question_

 i will be voting for john mccain the democrat nominee no one i m sitting this one out pollcode com free polls cross posted at dr _meta_end_dot_
