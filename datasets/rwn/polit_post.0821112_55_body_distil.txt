  i remember reading about how saddam and his two insane sons would torture professional soccer players when they lost _meta_end_dot_

 aside from the sheer horror described by the people who endured the abuse it struck me as supremely stupid to expect players to perform their best when they cowered in fear _meta_end_dot_

 communist leadership in eastern block countries before the wall came down and russia and the fascists in germany italy and japan before them just didn t get it _meta_end_dot_

 national pride is fine and dandy but if the athletes aren t competing for the love for themselves the game will be a losing proposition _meta_end_dot_

 at the olympic level the athletes excel physically and genetically and discipline wise _meta_end_dot_

 often what separates winners and losers is psychological and emotional mental stamina and courage _meta_end_dot_

 a terrified athlete running away from losing is not the same as an excited athlete running towards winning _meta_end_dot_

 so china harasses their athletes _meta_end_dot_

 some kids who have worked their whole lives were just booted from the team _meta_end_dot_

 other athletes who deeply desire retirement are being forced to compete _meta_end_dot_

 does this sound like a winning formulation to you _meta_end_question_

 although china is determined to top the medal tables at the beijing games next month its sports administration has taken the draconian decision to drop _meta_number_ref_ gold medal winning athletes china won a total of _meta_number_ref_ golds in athens and is hoping to top the _meta_number_ref_ mark in beijing _meta_end_dot_

 some of the athletes were forced out by injuries or strong competition but the china daily newspaper thought to be the mouthpiece of the government also said politics had played a part _meta_end_dot_

 there were some surprising exclusions _meta_end_dot_

 who would have a realistic shot at winning gold next month the paper said _meta_end_dot_

 the most obvious political victim was tian liang nicknamed the diver prince after winning gold medals in the ten metre platform dive at both the sydney and athens olympics _meta_end_dot_

 tian _meta_number_ref_ was kicked off the national team in _meta_number_ref_ for unashamedly endorsing everything from wooden floors to seafood snacks _meta_end_dot_

 he was producing a negative influence on the preparation for the _meta_number_ref_ olympics said a sports official _meta_end_dot_

 he also hit the gossip columns for his relationship with fellow diver guo jingjing and they were dubbed the posh and becks of chinese sport _meta_end_dot_

 she managed to stay on the team after she publicly denounced her behaviour _meta_end_dot_

 since then tian has tried to rehabilitate his career by competing at provincial level and refusing to criticise the administration for what happened _meta_end_dot_

 he carried the olympic torch as it passed through xi an _meta_end_dot_

 however he was still left out of the team and has voiced his regrets _meta_end_dot_

 yeah china will win loads of medals by kicking their superstars off the team because they don t toe the party line _meta_end_dot_

 but this is why these regimes die anyway _meta_end_dot_

 when people are restricted from pursuing their dreams because some bureaucrat believes his talents lie elsewhere people give up _meta_end_dot_

 a whole society of people not invested in their own success won t be invested in the country s success _meta_end_dot_

 so the dictators get the exact opposite of what they hope for _meta_end_dot_

 domination can come at the point of a gun but sustained success and winning comes from from freedom and love _meta_end_dot_
