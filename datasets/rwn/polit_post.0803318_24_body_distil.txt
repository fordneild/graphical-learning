  david sparks a member of the _meta_number_ref_ and _meta_number_ref_ bush for president campaigns has some advice for mitt romney it isn t over after super tuesday _meta_end_dot_

 since this sounds a lot like something i wrote just two days ago patience people there s still time for a romney surge i m all ears _meta_end_dot_

 here s david sparks take there s a side of me that resists giving career advice to rich successful guys with good hair _meta_end_dot_

 that said there s still hope mitt romney _meta_end_dot_

 there s a big difference between the super bowl and super tuesday _meta_end_dot_

 at the end of the super bowl the champion is crowned and the season is over _meta_end_dot_

 at the end of super tuesday only half the delegates will have been chosen with _meta_number_ref_ weeks to go _meta_end_dot_

 to be sure john mccain has the momentum _meta_end_dot_

 if the national media could award the nomination today mccain would be their man _meta_end_dot_

 but there are several factors working against a mccain coronation _meta_end_dot_

 super tuesday is a mix of all kinds of states across the country with a mix of winner take all and proportional allocation of delegates as well as open independents welcome and closed republicans only contests _meta_end_dot_

 western state mormons could give romney pockets of strength as could northeastern states _meta_end_dot_

 mike huckabee could be a factor in some southern states including georgia _meta_end_dot_

 while mccain s momentum is a big advantage the results will likely be mixed instead of a landslide victory _meta_end_dot_

 mccain now has _meta_number_ref_ delegates romney _meta_number_ref_ and huckabee _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 with super tuesday the delegates will have been selected in the first five weeks at a rate of _meta_number_ref_ delegates per week _meta_end_dot_

 afterward delegates will be squeezed out at a rate of only _meta_number_ref_ per week over four months _meta_end_dot_

 at this point the pace and the dynamics of the campaign change dramatically _meta_end_dot_

 this slowdown will create a huge drought with the political cognoscenti and the race may begin to lose its national attention hurting the candidate riding on momentum _meta_end_dot_

 the focus of the race will turn more and more to delegate counts _meta_end_dot_

 the republican delegates those already selected and those yet named will become very popular _meta_end_dot_

 after a series of semifinals in the first five weeks romney is where he has wanted to be in a virtual one on one contest against a candidate to the left of him in a nominating process dominated by conservatives _meta_end_dot_

 i helped run the primary campaign for george h w _meta_end_dot_

 bush against ronald reagan in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 it s no fun being to the left of your opponent in a republican race _meta_end_dot_

 mccain presents a political cognitive dissonance to republican activists _meta_end_dot_

 traditionally republicans love the heir apparent and the front runner status that mccain enjoys _meta_end_dot_

 on the other hand mccain is the pi ata of the conservative talk shows and websites across the country important opinion leaders with the republican base _meta_end_dot_

 there will not be a comfortable coalescing around mccain as the presumptive nominee _meta_end_dot_

 romney is still sitting on a pot of money _meta_end_dot_

 with the contests drawn out and with mccain scrambling with conservative donors romney will be able to use his money strategically cherry picking in delegate rich contests _meta_end_dot_

 after tuesday the media will target the states they consider important _meta_end_dot_

 tops on their list will be ohio on march _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 next to michigan which romney won and which has a similar economy the buckeye state will probably be friendly to romney _meta_end_dot_

 romney is still due his comeback kid moment with the voters _meta_end_dot_

 mccain was struggling for campaign money and lost members of his staff last summer but made his comeback _meta_end_dot_

 hillary clinton lost iowa and battled back in new hampshire _meta_end_dot_

 the media will have second thoughts about ending this race too early _meta_end_dot_

 a new look romney perhaps with more humility and a sharpened message might give his campaign a second wind _meta_end_dot_

 more winner take all primaries on super tuesday than there are on the democratic party side _meta_end_dot_

 nonetheless nobody has a crystal ball _meta_end_dot_

 a lot can happen on tuesday _meta_end_dot_

 as long as he is not mathematically eliminated romney should stay in the race and run to win _meta_end_dot_

 do you remember the scene in forrest gump where forrest starts running to get away from bullies and as he runs the braces fly off his legs and he just keeps running and never stops _meta_end_question_

 in your own life can you think back to a time when you shook off the limitations others had put on you and just ran your heart out or played your heart out or worked your heart out and won _meta_end_question_

 it s one of the best feelings in the world isn t it _meta_end_question_

 there s still time for a romney surge _meta_end_dot_

 run romney run _meta_end_exclamation_
