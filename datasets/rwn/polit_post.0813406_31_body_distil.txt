  obama s _meta_number_ref_ states screw up really caught my eye and i ll tell you why not only did he miss how many states we have he missed it really badly and didn t catch his own error after he said it _meta_end_dot_

 that means that it wasn t just a slip of the tongue and i have trouble believing that obama is so ignorant that he simply didn t know how many states we have _meta_end_dot_

 so what explains his mistake _meta_end_question_

 honestly my first thought was that he was so coked up that he lost track of how many states we have _meta_end_dot_

 is that implausible _meta_end_question_

 not at all _meta_end_dot_

 this is a guy who admits that he has used cocaine and was headed towards being a junkie at one point _meta_end_dot_

 could he be back at it during a stressful campaign _meta_end_question_

 sure he could _meta_end_dot_

 when was the last time the guy took a drug test _meta_end_question_

 has he ever taken one _meta_end_question_

 let s just hope that if he gets into the white house he isn t using and on a coke bender if one of those _meta_number_ref_ am crisis calls comes in _meta_end_dot_
