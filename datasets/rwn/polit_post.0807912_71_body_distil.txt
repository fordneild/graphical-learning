  the hopes of democratic party leaders to solve the delegate impasses in florida and michigan have been dashed as technicalities have proven impossible to overcome _meta_end_dot_

 the ap reports that facing strong opposition florida democrats on monday abandoned plans to hold a do over presidential primary with a mail in vote and threw the delegate dispute into the lap of the national party _meta_end_dot_

 the same situation obtains in michigan state lawmakers looking at a democratic presidential primary redo in michigan appear to be locked in a standoff heading into a crucial week legislative leaders say the u s _meta_end_dot_

 sen _meta_end_dot_

 barack obama camp needs to agree to the repeat election before legislation is written and obama supporters say they must see the bill before signing off on the plan _meta_end_dot_

 whether michigan has a do over primary in june depends on resolving that issue _meta_end_dot_

 state sen _meta_end_dot_

 tupac hunter d detroit said sunday that allies of u s _meta_end_dot_

 sen _meta_end_dot_

 hillary rodham clinton are bent on a do over primary to enable their candidate to try to pull up to obama in the presidential race _meta_end_dot_

 hunter said he won t sign off on a repeat election unless he sees detailed legislation answering his concerns _meta_end_dot_

 clinton folks will do anything to open michigan back up said hunter who is co chairman of the obama campaign in michigan _meta_end_dot_

 she is in a hunt for delegates _meta_end_dot_

 why this sudden pull out all the stops to give hillary clinton every opportunity to try to catch up _meta_end_question_

 guess what _meta_end_question_

 it s not going to happen _meta_end_dot_

 this legislator is not going to facilitate it the proposed primary re vote legislation in michigan prevents those who ve voted in the republican primary from voting in the re vote _meta_end_dot_

 fair enough right _meta_end_question_

 but about _meta_percent_ref_ of the those who vote in the gop primary according to the exit polls were democrats or independents _meta_end_dot_

 it s a fair bet that many of them were obama supporters as he was not on the original michigan ballot _meta_end_dot_

 this could be a dealbreaker for the obama campaign in michigan _meta_end_dot_

 the bottom line is that the states decision to flout party rules by holding early elections unalterably changed the dynamics of the race _meta_end_dot_

 there s no way to hold a do over at this point that wouldn t disadvantage one of the candidates _meta_end_dot_

 this is complicated by the fact that obama is now ahead in the overall delegate count and reasonably enough doesn t want to put two contests that clinton would be favored to win back into the game at the end _meta_end_dot_

 had he lost them fair and square early on but by relatively small counts the race might well have proceeded much as it has _meta_end_dot_

 but two late clinton wins could alter the perception of the race going into the convention _meta_end_dot_

 there s simply no solution to this that would be considered fair by both camps _meta_end_dot_

 given that playing by the rules as previously determined and not seating the florida and michigan delegations while the nomination is up for grabs is the least bad course of action _meta_end_dot_
