  i caught a minute of sean hannity as i was driving home the other day _meta_end_dot_

 he played and read for his audience numerous quotations from past american presidents as well as benjamin franklin each of whom acknowledged a beneficent judeo christian god from whom our liberties flow _meta_end_dot_

 i ve assembled my own collection of such quotations all from presidents deeply revered by the progressives george washington it is impossible to rightly govern a nation without god and the bible john adams we have no government armed with power capable of contending with human passions unbridled by morality and religion _meta_end_dot_

 avarice ambition revenge or gallantry would break the strongest cords of our constitution as a whale goes through a net _meta_end_dot_

 our constitution is designed only for a moral and religious people _meta_end_dot_

 it is wholly inadequate for any other thomas jefferson religion as well as reason confirms the soundness of those principles on which our government has been founded and its rights asserted abraham lincoln i know that the lord is always on the side of the right _meta_end_dot_

 but it is my constant anxiety and prayer that i and this nation should be on the lord s side franklin d _meta_end_dot_

 roosevelt as americans we go forward in the service of our country by the will of god john f _meta_end_dot_

 kennedy for i have sworn before you and almighty god the same solemn oath our forebears prescribed nearly a century and three quarters ago _meta_end_dot_

 the world is very different now _meta_end_dot_

 for man holds in his mortal hands the power to abolish all forms of human poverty and all forms of human life _meta_end_dot_

 and yet the same revolutionary beliefs for which our forebears fought are still at issue around the globe the belief that the rights of man come not from the generosity of the state but from the hand of god as hannity rightly observed during his show nothing palin has said in public life is more extreme than anything these presidents said in the past _meta_end_dot_

 each was a religious man whether hewing to a strict denomination or as seems to be the case with jefferson and madison being a non denominational deist _meta_end_dot_

 each understood that the separation of church and state does not mean that in order to participate in american political life people must be without faith _meta_end_dot_

 instead each understood as madison and jefferson both explicitly stated that americans were free to be religious and indeed would benefit greatly from religion _meta_end_dot_

 the founders were not anti religion _meta_end_dot_

 instead they were against government sponsored religion _meta_end_dot_

 they had been raised in a world in which the state had an official religion _meta_end_dot_

 the government dictated religious doctrine and because the state was loath to cede control it made sure that all positions of power whether in education or the government were limited to those who embraced this state controlled religion _meta_end_dot_

 it was this intermingling of church and state against which the founders rebelled _meta_end_dot_

 they never rebelled against god _meta_end_dot_

 and as the quotations above show past american presidents have fully understood that entering the white house did not require them to check their faith at the door _meta_end_dot_

 the constitution did ensure however that their faith was their own guide and comfort and not something that they could impose upon the american people _meta_end_dot_

 sarah palin s governance in alaska shows that she understands this distinction as well _meta_end_dot_
