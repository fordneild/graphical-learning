  mike huckabee has caught a lot of heat for some comments he made back in _meta_number_ref_ about aids _meta_end_dot_

 truthfully i thought the reaction to what huckabee said has been more than a little overwrought the associated press reported saturday that as a candidate for the senate in _meta_number_ref_ huckabee said in response to a _meta_number_ref_ question survey that he believed that aids patients should be isolated from the general public and that homosexuality was an aberrant unnatural and sinful lifestyle that posed a dangerous public risk fear of aids spreading into the community were fairly widespread in the mid _meta_number_ref_s but by the time huckabee answered the survey it was well established that the virus could not be spread through casual contact _meta_end_dot_

 when asked about aids research in _meta_number_ref_ huckabee complained that it received an unfair share of federal dollars when compared to cancer diabetes and heart disease _meta_end_dot_

 an alternative would be to request that multimillionaire celebrities such as elizabeth taylor madonna and others who are pushing for more aids funding be encouraged to give out of their own personal treasuries increased amounts for aids research huckabee wrote in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 huckabee said saturday that his comments came at a time when the aids crisis was just that a crisis _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 if i were making those same comments today i might make them a little differently he said that at the time he wanted public health authorities to treat aids like tuberculosis and other infectious diseases _meta_end_dot_

 that was why he wrote in _meta_number_ref_ that it is difficult to understand the public policy towards aids _meta_end_dot_

 it is the first time in the history of civilization in which the carriers of a genuine plague have not been isolated from the general population and in which this deadly disease for which there is no cure is being treated as a civil rights issue instead of the true health crisis it represents _meta_end_dot_

 medical protocol typically says that if you have a disease for which there is no cure and you are uncertain about the transmission of it then the first thing you do is that you quarantine or isolate carriers he wrote _meta_end_dot_

 first of all saying that homosexuality is an aberrant unnatural and sinful lifestyle that posed a dangerous public risk shouldn t be that controversial _meta_end_dot_

 the aberrant part is a given as is the dangerous public risk given that homosexual behavior along with intravenous drug use is responsible for the overwhelming majority of aids cases in the us _meta_end_dot_

 as far as the unnatural and sinful lifestyle part goes well that s what christians believe _meta_end_dot_

 sexually active unmarried heterosexuals are engaging in sinful behavior as far as christians are concerned too _meta_end_dot_

 when it comes to spending we way way way overspend on aids compared to cancer and heart disease _meta_end_dot_

 i had trouble finding the most current data but this info from _meta_number_ref_ gives you an idea of the staggering amount we spend on aids compared to other health problems although aids cases and deaths are declining and the disease remains completely preventable it nonetheless gets almost _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ in research funds per death from the national institute of health _meta_end_dot_

 compare that to its closest rivals parkinson s disease prostate cancer and diabetes _meta_end_dot_

 all of these receive about _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ per death _meta_end_dot_

 alzheimers gets about _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 as far as saying that aids patients should be isolated from the general public goes that isn t outrageous when you consider the incredible hype about aids that used to be put out in this country _meta_end_dot_

 it was every bit as bad as the global warming propaganda we get today and then some _meta_end_dot_

 just to give you an example back when i was in high school i think this would have been in _meta_number_ref_ the teachers brought in a special counselor to our class who told us we could get aids from french kissing _meta_end_dot_

 even back then before i was political i thought that didn t sound right so i asked how many cases they had confirmed of people getting aids from french kissing _meta_end_dot_

 the guy told me _meta_number_ref_ they thought _meta_end_dot_

 but that was just par for the course _meta_end_dot_

 just a few years before that in _meta_number_ref_ oprah winfrey said research studies now project that one in five listen to me hard to believe one in five heterosexuals could be dead from aids at the end of the next three years _meta_end_dot_

 that s by _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 one in five _meta_end_dot_

 it is no longer just a gay disease _meta_end_dot_

 believe me you can say that the people knew that the disease wasn t spread by casual contact back then which is true but they thought it was much easily transmitted through sexual contact than it turned out to be at least here in the united states _meta_end_dot_

 in some african nations like botswana and nigeria where more than _meta_percent_ref_ of the population has aids i bet they wish they could go back in time and isolate everyone who had aids in their country back in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 so given the environment in the us in the years immediately preceding huckabee s written comments huckabee s suggestion wasn t very outrageous at all _meta_end_dot_
