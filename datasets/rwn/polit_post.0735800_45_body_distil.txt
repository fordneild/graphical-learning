 it s not going to bring back my brother but it s something close to it said madison lee as she played with lex after the ceremony _meta_end_dot_

 military officials initially told the family that lex had another two years of service before he could be adopted _meta_end_dot_

 but the family lobbied for months even enlisting the aid of a north carolina congressman and the adoption came exactly nine months after the _meta_number_ref_ year old marine was killed and his dog wounded on march _meta_number_ref_ in iraq s anbar province _meta_end_dot_
