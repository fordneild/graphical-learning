  everyone knows about john mccain s brave and honorable military service in vietnam _meta_end_dot_

 a lot of people know that he comes from a long line of military officers _meta_end_dot_

 according to senator harkin d ia this is a bad thing _meta_end_dot_

 not just bad but potentially dangerous republican presidential candidate john mccain s family background as the son and grandson of admirals has given him a worldview shaped by the military and he has a hard time thinking beyond that sen _meta_end_dot_

 tom harkin d ia said friday _meta_end_dot_

 i think he s trapped in that harkin said in a conference call with iowa reporters _meta_end_dot_

 everything is looked at from his life experiences from always having been in the military and i think that can be pretty dangerous harkin said that it s one thing to have been drafted and served but another thing when you come from generations of military people and that s just how you re steeped how you ve learned how you ve grown up a mccain spokesman said harkin s remarks were offensive and showed that democrats are out of touch with americans values _meta_end_dot_

 senator harkin s comments are an affront to the many thousands of iowans who have served our country so valiantly for generations said spokesman jeff sadosky _meta_end_dot_

 this sort of attack shows just how out of touch democratic leadership has become with the values that have made our country so great volunteer to serve in the military right _meta_end_question_

 and gosh what a horrible way to be raised in a military family _meta_end_exclamation_

 imagine being raised with values like courage integrity honor valor selflessness and sacrifice _meta_end_dot_

 how awful _meta_end_exclamation_

 of course senator harkin is a liberal so he probably doesn t understand those kinds of things _meta_end_dot_

 personally having a marine for a father and two grandfathers who served in the navy one as a career i think growing up in a military family is pretty great _meta_end_dot_

 the military can instill values that you won t find anywhere else _meta_end_dot_

 you learn things and form bonds from military service that you won t find in anything else you will do _meta_end_dot_

 i can t convey the respect and admiration i have for those that serve enough _meta_end_dot_

 it s just unfortunate that libtards like harkin can t understand it _meta_end_dot_

 i ll let edhave the last word this comes of course from the same party whose senate intelligence chair suggested that military pilots have little human feeling _meta_end_dot_

 it precedes an effort by the new york timestomorrow along with some of mccain s oh so courageous unnamed senate colleagues to suggest that mccain didn t really experience vietnam because his five plus years as a pow kept him from learning all of the lessons john kerry experienced in his three months in a swift boat _meta_end_dot_

 this also comes from the same party that celebrated kerry s military experience while denigrating george bush s national guard service _meta_end_dot_

 according to harkin today bush would be a better candidate right _meta_end_question_

 if the democrats want to party like it s _meta_number_ref_ that s their choice _meta_end_dot_

 the rest of america grew up _meta_end_dot_

 people stopped drinking the new left kool aid a long time ago and quit treating veterans like baby killers and dr _meta_end_dot_

 strangelove _meta_end_dot_

 tom harkin jay rockefeller the new york times and a good portion of the left apparently never stopped _meta_end_dot_
