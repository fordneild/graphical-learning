  after taking an entire week off on vacation i thought it would be fun to write that classic essay that all of us were forced to scribble way back in _meta_number_ref_rd grade what i did on my summer vacation _meta_end_exclamation_

 of course back then we had a whole summer off and it still wasn t enough _meta_end_dot_

 now _meta_end_question_

 taking a week at once seems almost decadent _meta_end_dot_

 so did i go to europe head cross country or go on a cruise _meta_end_question_

 nope _meta_end_dot_

 i spent _meta_number_ref_ days relaxing _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ days doing grunt work and got back on my normal schedule last night _meta_end_dot_

 that may not seem like a lot of time off but typically in a month i take _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ days off completely without doing any work at all and those days are seldom consecutive _meta_end_dot_

 so taking _meta_number_ref_ days off in a row _meta_end_question_

 it feels like the equivalent of a person with a _meta_number_ref_ hour a week week ends off work schedule spending two months hanging out in barbados _meta_end_dot_

 so what did i do _meta_end_question_

 let s see _meta_end_dot_

 aside from the usual watching rented videos chatting on the phone with friends etc _meta_end_dot_

 i caught _meta_number_ref_ movies at the theater _meta_end_dot_

 kung fu panda i d give it _meta_number_ref_ out of _meta_number_ref_ stars _meta_end_dot_

 it was humorous uplifting and a pretty good flick overall _meta_end_dot_

 don t mess with the zohan the first _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ of the movie was really funny in a silly airplane sort of way _meta_end_dot_

 however the last third of the film bogged down in a sewer of moral equivalence that basically painted palestinian terrorists who are deliberately blowing up israelis as no better or worse than the israelis defending their country _meta_end_dot_

 thumbs down _meta_end_dot_

 hancock will smith s latest film hasn t gotten the best reviews but i thought it was an excellent flick _meta_end_dot_

 that being said it was almost like two completely different movies featuring the same characters _meta_end_dot_

 the first part was a comedy and the _meta_number_ref_nd part after an m _meta_end_dot_

 night shyamalan style twist was tragically romantic _meta_end_dot_

 for me it worked although the movie was a bit uneven _meta_end_dot_

 thumbs up _meta_end_dot_

 i also read _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ books _meta_end_dot_

 buffy the vampire slayer season eight volume _meta_number_ref_ the long way home by joss whedon read candy girl a year in the life of an unlikely stripper by diablo cody read better a surgeon s notes on performance by atul gawande _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ read additionally i spent a lot of time playing god of war _meta_number_ref_ on ps_meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 unfortunately i got a little bogged down in the middle of the game when i started getting to the tougher bosses and puzzles and didn t even get close to finishing the game before i had to return it _meta_end_dot_

 i guess that ll give me something to do at christmas when i have time to spend an hour or ten playing video games _meta_end_dot_

 last week i also got the first and second professional massages of my entire life and yes the first one which featured oil and hot rocks was so good that i decided to set up a _meta_number_ref_nd one a swedish massage at another place _meta_end_dot_

 personally i preferred the deeper tissue work of the swedish massage but both of them felt fantastic _meta_end_dot_

 on top of all that i went to a chiropractor and after they put me on a machine that ran electric charges through my back and then another machine that massaged my back with jets of water i got my back adjusted _meta_end_dot_

 it was definitely a plus _meta_end_dot_

 last but not least i picked up a banging slate coffee table for my living room on the cheap and spent _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ days doing grunt work on rwn and around the house _meta_end_dot_

 i cleaned out about _meta_percent_ref_ of my to do list and some of this stuff had literally been on the list for months _meta_end_dot_

 now that my friends is one hell of a great vacation week _meta_end_dot_
