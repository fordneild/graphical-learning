  this story was so unintentionally funny that i just had to post it the figure in the bark appeared about four months ago _meta_end_dot_

 donna pascariello poured coffee that october morning and looked through her back window hoping to see a deer or a fox or maybe a squirrel through the fog _meta_end_dot_

 she saw the figure in the bark _meta_end_dot_

 was it jesus christ _meta_end_question_

 ten maybe _meta_number_ref_ people have seen the light colored outline at the bottom of the tree donna and frank say _meta_end_dot_

 they ask each what do you see _meta_end_question_

 i don t put it in their head like do you want to see something that looks like christ donna says _meta_end_dot_

 one person saw a saint _meta_end_dot_

 others have split between jesus and the virgin mary _meta_end_dot_

 the light makes a difference _meta_end_dot_

 donna says it s most obvious between noon and _meta_number_ref_ p m _meta_end_dot_

 when the sunlight hits the tree full on _meta_end_dot_

 other times the figure shifts a little but it remains donna and frank say _meta_end_dot_

 they don t know exactly what to make of it _meta_end_dot_

 donna says she was raised catholic but doesn t make it to church that often _meta_end_dot_

 still a certain balance seems to have fallen on the family since the figure appeared she says _meta_end_dot_

 family illnesses the trials of everyday life dealing with everything seems a little more manageable _meta_end_dot_

 wait it s either jesus the virgin mary or a saint _meta_end_question_

 maybe it s just me but it looks like someone just tossed some chalky water on a tree and took a picture _meta_end_dot_

 but wait if i couldn t just write it off to chalky water or weird tree rot who would i say it was _meta_end_question_

 hmmmm i m going to go with jack skellington from the nightmare before christmas granted the jack skellington theory sort of ruins their whole the magic tree person is making our lives more manageable shtick but that s ga ga anyway _meta_end_dot_

 so here s a suggestion for donna stop looking for jesus in a tree and start going back to church _meta_end_dot_

 you can get that same feeling of balance without having to imagine that you see god in the bark of trees in your back yard _meta_end_dot_
