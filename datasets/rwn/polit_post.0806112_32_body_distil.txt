  today i ve got an interesting question _meta_end_dot_

 on the right you tend to hear a lot about the virtue of personal responsibility _meta_end_dot_

 we stress it and emphasize it to seemingly no end _meta_end_dot_

 but at what point if any does personal responsibility end _meta_end_question_

 the parents of amanda jax have filed a lawsuit against a nightclub jax attended and the friends accompanying her _meta_end_dot_

 amanda died after a drinking binge to celebrate her _meta_number_ref_st birthday and her parents are alleging that the nightclub should have stopped serving her when she was obviously intoxicated and that her friends should have stepped in as well _meta_end_dot_

 the family of a woman who drank herself to death at a mankato nightspot while celebrating her _meta_number_ref_st birthday is suing not only the establishment but also the friends who bought her a steady stream of drinks _meta_end_dot_

 the lawsuit filed thursday in blue earth county district court alleges that on oct _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ the college age friends of amanda jax bought her one drink after another in less than two hours _meta_end_dot_

 as a result jax s parents are taking the unusual legal step of suing her companions in a case that could set a precedent as to who can be held legally liable when someone drinks too much _meta_end_dot_

 it s evolutionary said prof _meta_end_dot_

 barry feld of the university of minnesota law school who used the scenario as a question on a final exam last semester _meta_end_dot_

 it s pushing the edges of legal liability _meta_end_dot_

 these kinds of cases are the engines that drive social change that desire for change along with holding people responsible for their daughter s death is what is driving the lawsuit jax s parents said thursday _meta_end_dot_

 jax the suit contends was in the care of the friends who gave alcohol to an obviously intoxicated person their actions the suit argues created an unreasonable risk of causing physical harm to jax and the friends failed to exercise reasonable care in preventing harm to her _meta_end_dot_

 i don t know how they could have called themselves friends and not done anything said a tearful jenny haag jax s mother _meta_end_dot_

 they helped her drink even when she wanted to quit _meta_end_dot_

 if people had called _meta_number_ref_ in time then amanda s death could have been avoided at the apartment where jax died the suit says an intoxicated jax was tended to by two of the defendants about _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ a m _meta_end_dot_

 oct _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ when she had been unconscious for approximately one hour and had vomited twice _meta_end_dot_

 no one sought medical help for the dying amanda a _meta_number_ref_ call was made from the apartment about _meta_number_ref_ a m police records show after a friend discovered jax s cold body _meta_end_dot_

 how much did amanda drink _meta_end_question_

 according to the lawsuit she had _meta_end_dot_

 one or two cans of beer at an apartment before going to sidelines a pitcher of long island iced tea equal to _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ shots of hard liquor five shots of hard alcohol two beers and the cherry vodka energy drink concoction _meta_end_dot_

 was amanda s _meta_number_ref_st birthday when your friends are practically expected to buy and feed you drinks all night long _meta_end_dot_

 in any case what s the verdict here _meta_end_question_

 at what point does it stop being a matter of personal responsibility _meta_end_question_

 let me start by saying that i absolutely think her friends should have recognized when she had too much to drink _meta_end_dot_

 they absolutely should have recognized when she had enough and stepped in to put an end to it _meta_end_dot_

 but should they be held legally accountable for not doing so _meta_end_question_

 here s my problem with that _meta_end_dot_

 amanda knew what she was getting into _meta_end_dot_

 she drank every drink willingly no one held her down opened her mouth and poured the drinks down her throat _meta_end_dot_

 the thing about drinking and especially about binge drinking is that we all know what the risks are _meta_end_dot_

 kids start getting drug education just say no in as early as elementary school _meta_end_dot_

 in mine it was a program called dare drug abuse resistance education it usually continues on through high school teaching the effects and risks of everything from cigarettes and alcohol to cocaine and heroin _meta_end_dot_

 the effects of drinking too much are almost as commonly known as the risks of smoking _meta_end_dot_

 the problem is almost everyone my age admittedly has superman syndrome when it comes to drinking _meta_end_dot_

 we all hear horror stories like amanda s but no one ever thinks it will actually happen to them _meta_end_dot_

 i highly doubt that amanda had never consumed alcohol before and frankly that she d never been drunk before _meta_end_dot_

 that said i can t help but think that when one decides to go on a drinking binge for whatever reason they know what they re getting into _meta_end_dot_

 you know the risks when you take the first drink _meta_end_dot_

 her friends should have been looking out for her but i can t see how they can be legally held accountable _meta_end_dot_

 the nightclub however is a different story _meta_end_dot_

 when an establishment whether a restaurant bar or nightclub gets a liquor license one of the stipulations is that you cannot continue to serve someone who is obviously intoxicated _meta_end_dot_

 if amanda did not appear to be completely drunk out of her mind when the bartender bought her the final drink a shot called a cherry bomb then he can t technically be held responsible _meta_end_dot_

 but if she was falling off her barstool slurring her speech etc and he still served her then he can be held responsible and the nightclub can lose their liquor license which has apparently already been suspended for thirty days _meta_end_dot_

 i m no judge and i m not a lawyer so my legal expertise here is obviously lacking _meta_end_dot_

 but i can t help but think that while you might be able to make a case against the nightclub holding her friends responsible as well is taking it a little far _meta_end_dot_

 yes they bought her drinks on her _meta_number_ref_st birthday _meta_end_dot_

 they didn t though force her to drink _meta_end_dot_

 amanda made the decision to drink herself to death _meta_end_dot_

 her friends should have been more attentive but ultimately even with the bartender serving her past the point of obvious inebriation the fault is her own _meta_end_dot_

 we can point fingers all day long but at the end of the day it was her decision _meta_end_dot_

 that may make it harder for her parents to cope with her death but it s the truth _meta_end_dot_

 her friends should have been looking out for her but they weren t her babysitters _meta_end_dot_

 she was _meta_number_ref_ years old and old enough to make her own decisions _meta_end_dot_

 when you cut everything else away it was ultimately amanda s decision that led to tragedy and what happened was a tragedy _meta_end_dot_

 but i couldn t honestly say that others can really be held responsible in a court of law for amanda s inability and or unwillingness to say enough _meta_end_dot_

 you can only hold others responsible for your actions for so long _meta_end_dot_

 eventually you have to own up to your decisions no matter how tragic the consequences _meta_end_dot_

 update i just re read the article and apparently amanda jax had not one but two duis prior to turning _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 this only makes me feel that she was personally responsible for her own tragic death even more _meta_end_dot_

 hat tip ed at hot air to read more from cassy stop by her blog in fact she d love it if you did _meta_end_dot_
