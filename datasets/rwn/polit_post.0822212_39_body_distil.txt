  after _meta_number_ref_ days and the work of _meta_number_ref_ bureaucrats costing taxpayers an estimated _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ the case against the only publisher in the western world charged for reprinting the danish mohammed cartoons has been dismissed _meta_end_dot_

 and ezra levant isn t happy about it the _meta_number_ref_ page government report into my activities is a breathtakingly arrogant document _meta_end_dot_

 in it pardeep gundara a low level bureaucrat assumes the role of editor in chief for the entire province of alberta _meta_end_dot_

 he went through our magazine article and gave his own thoughts on the cartoons and pronounced on our magazine s decision to publish them _meta_end_dot_

 the government s wannabe journalist makes a spelling error he gets facts wrong and he s obviously not good with deadlines _meta_end_dot_

 we d never have hired him at our magazine _meta_end_dot_

 but the laugh is on us he s apparently our boss and the boss of all journalists in alberta _meta_end_dot_

 that is not acceptable to me _meta_end_dot_

 i am not interested in gundara s views about the cartoons _meta_end_dot_

 i m not interested in learning his personal rules of thumb for when i can or can t express myself _meta_end_dot_

 this is canada not saudi arabia _meta_end_dot_

 so what happens now _meta_end_question_

 levant is feistier than ever and his enemies are threatening a counterattack _meta_end_dot_

 it s far from over _meta_end_dot_
