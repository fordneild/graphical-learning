  last week i was talking with one my friends on the phone and she was telling me how much she hated the idea of men having their wives sign pre nuptial agreements _meta_end_dot_

 that s because in her mind the agreements were a sign that the man doesn t view the marriage as permanent _meta_end_dot_

 but au contraire i told her they re actually a defense against a court system that allows undeserving women to loot rich men of the money they ve earned and besides no matter how committed to a marriage you may be if your partner doesn t feel the same way and you re a rich man you re screwed _meta_end_dot_

 in other words it s not about the man not being committed to the marriage it s about the man worrying how much it will cost him if his new wife isn t committed to the marriage _meta_end_dot_

 exhibit a on how men get treated when divorces go to court is the paul mccartney heather mills case despite only being married to paul mccartney for four years heather mills was awarded _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ million and an additional _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ for her daughter s expenses in court yesterday _meta_end_dot_

 this is a far cry from the _meta_dollor_ref_ million she was demanding and less than the _meta_dollor_ref_ million settlement she and paul had mutually agreed upon _meta_end_dot_

 however mccartney s lawyer fiona shackleton who represented prince charles talked him out of it and urged him to let a judge decide _meta_end_dot_

 he did and the gamble paid off _meta_end_dot_

 mills response after the ruling _meta_end_question_

 throwing a glass of water at shackleton s head and a _meta_number_ref_ minute rant outside the high court because she felt she didn t get enough money _meta_end_dot_

 first of all what role did heather mills play in paul mccartney s success _meta_end_question_

 pretty much none whatsoever _meta_end_dot_

 he was incredibly rich and famous before he met her _meta_end_dot_

 but she at least spent _meta_number_ref_ years slaving over a hot stove and cleaning the mansion for him right _meta_end_question_

 given how rich they were that s very doubtful _meta_end_dot_

 moreover i think it s fair to ask what benefits she got out of being married to paul mccartney _meta_end_dot_

 he s fabulously rich and she got to share in his wealth _meta_end_dot_

 he s famous and she got to share in his fame _meta_end_dot_

 how many opportunities came her way and will continue to come her way just because she was married to him _meta_end_question_

 plenty i m sure _meta_end_dot_

 so what are we talking about here _meta_end_question_

 we re talking about a gold digger who married paul mccartney and looted his bank account for _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 should he have had a pre nup _meta_end_question_

 oh you bet _meta_end_dot_

 should any wealthy man get a pre nup _meta_end_question_

 given how rigged the court system is against a man after a divorce in most places you bet _meta_end_dot_

 ps i know _meta_number_ref_ million dollars isn t a big chunk of mccartney s fortune but it s still _meta_number_ref_ million dollars _meta_end_dot_
