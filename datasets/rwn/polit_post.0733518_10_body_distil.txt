  if by tragedy you mean yet another example of how global warming is all a giant scam and people who keep doing stuff like this and end up making idiots out of themselves only to prove their own theory wrong _meta_end_dot_

 these are not the first people to try and prove that global warming is true by hiking through the arctic where the polar ice is supposedly melting _meta_end_dot_

 the result however is the same emphasis mine a north pole expedition meant to bring attention to global warming was called off after one of the explorers got frostbite _meta_end_dot_

 the explorers ann bancroft and liv arnesen on saturday called off what was intended to be a _meta_number_ref_ mile trek across the arctic ocean after arnesen suffered frostbite in three of her toes and extreme cold temperatures drained the batteries in some of their electronic equipment _meta_end_dot_

 ann said losing toes and going forward at all costs was never part of the journey said ann atwood who helped organize the expedition _meta_end_dot_

 but the latest trek got off to a bad start _meta_end_dot_

 the day they set off from ward hunt island a plane landing near the women hit their gear punching a hole in bancroft s sled and damaging one of arnesen s snowshoes _meta_end_dot_

 they repaired the snowshoe with binding from a ski but atwood said the patch job created pressure on arnesen s left foot which led to blisters that then turned into frostbite _meta_end_dot_

 then there was the cold _ quite a bit colder atwood said then bancroft and arnesen had expected _meta_end_dot_

 one night they measured the temperature inside their tent at _meta_number_ref_ degrees below zero and outside temperatures were exceeding _meta_number_ref_ below zero at times atwood said _meta_end_dot_

 my first reaction when they called to say there were calling it off was that they just sounded really really cold atwood said _meta_end_dot_

 she said bancroft and arnesen were applying hot water bottles to arnesen s foot every night but had to wake up periodically because the bottles froze _meta_end_dot_

 the explorers had planned to call in regular updates to school groups by satellite phone and had planned online posts with photographic evidence of global warming _meta_end_dot_

 in contrast to bancroft s _meta_number_ref_ trek across the arctic with fellow minnesota explorer will steger this time she and arnesen were prepared to don body suits and swim through areas where polar ice has melted _meta_end_dot_

 atwood said there was some irony that a trip to call attention to global warming was scuttled in part by extreme cold temperatures _meta_end_dot_

 they were experiencing temperatures that weren t expected with global warming atwood said _meta_end_dot_

 but one of the things we see with global warming is unpredictability unpredictability now i get it _meta_end_exclamation_

 extreme cold global warming _meta_end_dot_

 lots of hurricanes global warming _meta_end_dot_

 no hurricanes global warming _meta_end_dot_

 blizzards global warming _meta_end_dot_

 any kind of weather anywhere is caused by global warming _meta_end_exclamation_

 what i can t help but wonder about is how these out to prove global warming true explorers and these two are definitely not the first ones and probably won t be the last ever thought anything different would happen _meta_end_dot_

 i mean when they sat around thinking about swimming through the arctic circle did they really believe their own propaganda and think they wouldn t freeze _meta_end_question_

 and even if they did believe their own propaganda why did they not realize the game was up when their gear froze _meta_end_question_

 maybe then they just sat around and started praying to the goracle _meta_end_dot_

 instead of facing mecca they face malibu _meta_end_dot_

 global warming and environmentalism is the religion of choice for moonbats after all _meta_end_dot_

 a good quote from american thinker _meta_end_dot_

 i hope they are now letting those school groups know that it is foolish to plan to swim in the arctic beacuse it gets really really cold there _meta_end_dot_

 hat tip moonbattery _meta_end_dot_
