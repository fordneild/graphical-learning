  via hot air here s what david gergen had to say about john mccain s latest outstanding ad david gergen mccain s moses ad is code for calling obama uppity in which the single dumbest most paranoid racial charge of the campaign is recycled on national television by a former presidential advisor and current harvard professor _meta_end_dot_

 i said it before but it bears repeating if you take this logic to its conclusion there s literally no non racist way to accuse a member of a minority group of having an outsized ego _meta_end_dot_

 any synonym you can conjure elitist arrogant megalomaniac narcissist to quote hitchens can all happily be dismissed as code regardless of whether the subject might in fact a display his very own presidential seal b be known to describe rural voters in terms that call to mind cletus the slackjawed yokel on the simpsons and c oh by the way lead his very own cult with himself as godhead _meta_end_dot_

 remember when obama was going to be the anti jesse jackson who helped america put race in the rear view mirror _meta_end_question_

 well now the post racial candidate is the post jeremiah wright candidate and it s hard to miss the fact that instead moving us beyond race obama and his supporters are actually ramping up the hyper sensitivity _meta_end_dot_

 as evidenced by gergen s bizarre criticism we ve gotten to the point where almost any criticism aimed at obama for any reason is now being treated as some sort of racial attack _meta_end_dot_

 so let s see obama was a member of an anti white church for _meta_number_ref_ years talks about typical white people only won the democratic primaries because he is black and now he and his supporters are trying to rule all criticism off limits because of his race _meta_end_dot_

 some post racial candidate obama turned out to be _meta_end_dot_
