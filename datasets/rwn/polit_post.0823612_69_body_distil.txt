  there was a shooting at a schoolin tennessee where a _meta_number_ref_ year old freshman walked calmly up to another student and shot him in the chest _meta_end_dot_

 he then walked away _meta_end_dot_

 this is a horrible tragedy obviously but a blogger katie allison granju never heard of her until now has figured out why this happened _meta_end_dot_

 it s because teenage boys are stupid _meta_end_exclamation_

 teenage boys are idiots _meta_end_dot_

 and today s american teenage boys whom our culture holds in a sort of manchild limbo long past the age they need to be doing some sort of hard work and earning their keep are even bigger idiots _meta_end_dot_

 by the time a male is about _meta_number_ref_ years old he has the body of an adult male an adult male with a brain under assault by a dramatic rush of hormones the likes of which he ll never again see during any other period of his lifetime _meta_end_dot_

 teenage boys are more impulsive and aggressive than any other group _meta_end_dot_

 witness their penchant for crashing cars diving headfirst into rock quarries experimenting with drugs and deciding to play chicken by draping themselves across dark country roads in an attempt to prove something to their similarly stupid peers they are driven by sexual curiosity to the point of insanity and they hold a misguided sense of immortality _meta_end_dot_

 yes i m generalizing _meta_end_dot_

 many teenage boys are polite respectful accomplished individuals but those of them who are are pulling this off are doing so by fighting the natural impulses to be idiots that threaten to overtake them every day _meta_end_dot_

 there is perhaps no other single group in american life less suited to have access to handguns than teenage boys _meta_end_dot_

 which leads me to the primary question i have yet to see answered regarding yesterday s tragic shooting at central high school _meta_end_dot_

 where did the boy get that gun _meta_end_question_

 i want to know the provenance of that gun and if evidence is found that any adult knowingly or very negligently allowed that kid to get his hands on that gun that adult deserves to be sitting behind bars this morning along with the boy who fired the shot _meta_end_dot_

 teenage boys are stupid _meta_end_dot_

 so are the adults who allow them to get their hands on guns _meta_end_dot_

 these kinds of people mostly women bother the hell out of me _meta_end_dot_

 omigod _meta_end_exclamation_

 teenage boys are like so stupid _meta_end_exclamation_

 they re irresponsible _meta_end_exclamation_

 they re reckless _meta_end_exclamation_

 yearrghh _meta_end_exclamation_

 can the people who come up with this crap just once come up with an original thought _meta_end_question_

 please _meta_end_question_

 yes teenage boys tend to be more of the daredevil type _meta_end_dot_

 yes they do stupid things sometimes and take stupid risks _meta_end_dot_

 they also tend to be exceedingly loyal and i ve found them to be rather considerate and great friends _meta_end_dot_

 unlike teenage girls may i point out _meta_end_dot_

 i had many more guy friends in high school than girl friends _meta_end_dot_

 part of this was because i participated in a male dominated sport crew but another part of it was that i wasn t interested in having a lot of girlfriends _meta_end_dot_

 i had a few but by and large i didn t get along with a lot of girls _meta_end_dot_

 why _meta_end_question_

 because girls are vicious jealous backstabbing bitches in high school _meta_end_dot_

 they re two faced and evil and mean _meta_end_dot_

 hell hath no fury like a teenage girl _meta_end_dot_

 teenage boys at least stick with their friends through and through _meta_end_dot_

 even when they get into a fight they ll duke it out and then ten minutes later be best friends again _meta_end_dot_

 so simple _meta_end_dot_

 so uncomplicated _meta_end_dot_

 no three hour conversations about who screwed who over first or why such and such s boyfriend was my boyfriend first and blah blah blah blah blah _meta_end_dot_

 piss off a teenage girl and it s never a ten minute fight _meta_end_dot_

 she won t try to kick your ass but she will try to ruin your life _meta_end_dot_

 she will poison every well spread as many rumors as possible and in general try to make your life as miserable as possible _meta_end_dot_

 i don t care if saying this pisses people off because it s the truth _meta_end_dot_

 sure there are exceptions but teenage girls simply tend to be not very nice people _meta_end_dot_

 let me give you an example of how vicious girls can be _meta_end_dot_

 i was going to play in my high school s annual powderpuff football game _meta_end_dot_

 every year it s the junior girls vs _meta_end_dot_

 the senior girls and every year the seniors win _meta_end_dot_

 well my senior year rolled around and the junior girls were making a lot of noise about how the game had been fixed all this time and this year they were finally going to win _meta_end_dot_

 it got the entire school talking _meta_end_dot_

 so in our next senior girls planning meeting what was decided _meta_end_question_

 that the juniors needed to be taught a lesson _meta_end_dot_

 a pot was passed around and everyone was asked to throw in money _meta_end_dot_

 the senior girl who drew the most blood from the juniors would win the entire pot _meta_end_dot_

 i promptly quit _meta_end_dot_

 teenage guys while reckless and daring are by far less cruel than girls are _meta_end_dot_

 my brother is a good example for this _meta_end_dot_

 he was definitely one of the stupider kids on the block when it came to doing dumb sh t _meta_end_dot_

 you could dare him to do anything and he would _meta_end_dot_

 he had scars all over his body from getting hurt but usually after he got hurt he d just pop back up and do it again _meta_end_dot_

 he did a lot of bmx in high school was pretty good at it and even built his own ramps in a sandlot behind a church for him and his friends _meta_end_dot_

 they were constantly falling down breaking bones bleeding bruising and in general hurting themselves _meta_end_dot_

 but they were boys _meta_end_dot_

 and that s how boys are _meta_end_dot_

 although i will say i didn t know of a whole lot of diving headfirst into rock quarries _meta_end_dot_

 that one i think must be some kind of phenomenon that only happens to teenage boys the author knows because i sure as hell have never heard of it _meta_end_dot_

 anyway my brother was also one of the sweetest kindest people you ever could meet _meta_end_dot_

 he treated his girlfriend becky like a princess _meta_end_dot_

 he was one of the most loyal people i ever knew _meta_end_dot_

 and he volunteered every summer at camp i am special a summer camp for disabled children even taking a lifeguard position there so he could spend more time with the kids there _meta_end_dot_

 he had a big heart _meta_end_dot_

 and he wasn t an anomaly _meta_end_dot_

 of course according to ms _meta_end_dot_

 boys are stupid over there that meant he was fighting the natural impulse all boys have to be stupid tooth and nail _meta_end_dot_

 i guess according to her teenager boys are idiotic creatures with very few things running through their pathetic little minds sex drugs and do dumb sh t _meta_end_dot_

 i really really hope this woman doesn t have any male offspring _meta_end_dot_

 how would she explain this to them when they become teenagers _meta_end_question_

 and of course there s the whole access to guns schtick thrown in there too _meta_end_dot_

 because you know once the gun was put into this reckless and stupid boy s hands he suddenly was a man possessed and completely not in control of his actions _meta_end_dot_

 if only he hadn t have had access to a gun he never would ve had the will to murder _meta_end_dot_

 christ almighty _meta_end_dot_

 why is it that liberals are so anxious to blame the gun _meta_end_question_

 or society _meta_end_question_

 or anything beyond the sick individual who pulled the trigger _meta_end_question_

 that gun did not cause the murder of an innocent teenger a sick twisted screw up of a human being did _meta_end_dot_

 but oh no _meta_end_dot_

 teenage boys must never ever have access to guns because if they did they d all go on murderous rampages _meta_end_exclamation_

 of course i guess giving them access to guns in a safe environment under strict supervision where they can learn to use them properly and respect the danger of weapons would just be terrible _meta_end_dot_

 terrible _meta_end_dot_

 it s far better to just keep them away from them altogether _meta_end_dot_

 i mean seriously no one wants teenagers to have unlimited access to guns _meta_end_dot_

 that s why you have to be over a certain age to buy a gun _meta_end_dot_

 that s why there are regulations as to who can own a gun _meta_end_dot_

 i don t disagree with that _meta_end_dot_

 but you know it s pretty ridiculous to say that parents shouldn t allow their kids to touch a gun with a ten foot pole is a good idea _meta_end_dot_

 let s just call this tragedy what it really is _meta_end_dot_

 some asshole had problems with an innocent kid and because he s twisted in the head he murdered him _meta_end_dot_

 it s not the gun s fault _meta_end_dot_

 and it isn t yet another example of how stupid teenage boys are _meta_end_dot_

 sure teenage boys act like idiots sometimes but everyone does _meta_end_dot_

 it doesn t mean they are idiots _meta_end_dot_

 saying that teenage boys who are polite decent courteous kind and caring people are abnormal and weird is rude and wrong _meta_end_dot_

 very very wrong _meta_end_dot_

 but this kind of hyperbole from women is accepted now isn t it _meta_end_question_

 it s ok for women to bash men left and right _meta_end_dot_

 it s ok for women to talk about how horrible the male gender is _meta_end_dot_

 not enough women stand up and say how wrong it is and not enough men defend themselves _meta_end_dot_

 too many of us male and female let this kind of thing just happen without complaint _meta_end_dot_

 well not me _meta_end_dot_

 i won t just sit there and let these women think they re speaking in my name _meta_end_dot_

 yes there are some teenage boys who do awful things like this _meta_end_dot_

 there are also some teenage girls who do terrible things remember the youtube fighting incident _meta_end_dot_

 and hey guess what _meta_end_question_

 there are adult men and women who do terrible things _meta_end_dot_

 whaddya know _meta_end_question_

 there are crappy people in the world _meta_end_dot_

 saying it s normal for a certain demographic is wrong and offensive _meta_end_dot_

 these kinds of people are in the minority regardless of their age or gender _meta_end_dot_

 to say otherwise as this idiot blogger did is wrong and irresponsible at the absolute least _meta_end_dot_

 but of course you re allowed to put down boys and men _meta_end_dot_

 substitute teenage boys with girls blacks gays muslims or any other minority and the backlash would be unbelievable _meta_end_dot_

 she d be fired no doubt about it _meta_end_dot_

 and it d be just as wrong as her thesis that all teenage boys are stupid is _meta_end_dot_

 how much longer will we tolerate hateful women like this one putting down boys and men _meta_end_question_

 it isn t ok _meta_end_dot_

 it has an impact _meta_end_dot_

 and it needs to stop _meta_end_dot_

 we should be just as offended _meta_end_dot_

 we should be just as outraged _meta_end_dot_

 there s no place for this kind of thing in our society today and we shouldn t let this happen anymore _meta_end_dot_

 unfortunately we just sit there and meekly take it _meta_end_dot_

 ladies these are your husbands sons fathers and brothers that are being slandered _meta_end_dot_

 we need to let our voices be louder than those of the screeching hate harpies _meta_end_dot_

 but hey this author need not fear _meta_end_dot_

 if maureen dowd ever retires there s surely a position open for her at the new york times _meta_end_dot_
