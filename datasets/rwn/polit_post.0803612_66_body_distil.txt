  what a shocking surprise hillary clinton who was accused of crying crocodile tears in the run up to new hampshire has cried again coincidentally right before super tuesday _meta_end_dot_

 many cynical people like those of you reading this post will probably claim that this is a political ploy but come on folks do you really think hillary would tear up again just because a lot of people think it helped her win new hampshire _meta_end_question_

 tsk tsk tsk have you people become so jaded that you can t even recognize real emotion _meta_end_question_

 i mean many of you may not realize it because she has been running on her own merits but this is the wife of a former president here _meta_end_dot_

 do you think she d stoop so low as to cry in public just because she thinks it would help her in an election _meta_end_question_

 i mean it s almost as if you people are trying to put her in a no win situation here either she s a manipulative viper who s hoping to cry her way to the presidency which she clearly wouldn t deserve if that was the only way she could win or she s a snarling crone with a glass jaw who s nasty when she has the upper hand but emotionally crumbles when the going gets tough which would also make her unfit to be president _meta_end_dot_

 all i can say after those kind of allegations which many of you were no doubt about to make is shame on you for thinking such a thing _meta_end_exclamation_
