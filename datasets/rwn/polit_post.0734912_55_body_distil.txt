  one hundred scientists from around the globe aren t drinking the goracle s kool aid and have petitioned the un to stop pushing the global warming hoax and the hysteria associated with it _meta_end_dot_

 it is not possible to stop climate change a natural phenomenon that has affected humanity through the ages _meta_end_dot_

 geological archaeological oral and written histories all attest to the dramatic challenges posed to past societies from unanticipated changes in temperature precipitation winds and other climatic variables _meta_end_dot_

 we therefore need to equip nations to become resilient to the full range of these natural phenomena by promoting economic growth and wealth generation _meta_end_dot_

 the united nations intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc has issued increasingly alarming conclusions about the climatic influences of human produced carbon dioxide co_meta_number_ref_ a non polluting gas that is essential to plant photosynthesis _meta_end_dot_

 while we understand the evidence that has led them to view co_meta_number_ref_ emissions as harmful the ipcc s conclusions are quite inadequate as justification for implementing policies that will markedly diminish future prosperity _meta_end_dot_

 in particular it is not established that it is possible to significantly alter global climate through cuts in human greenhouse gas emissions _meta_end_dot_

 on top of which because attempts to cut emissions will slow development the current un approach of co_meta_number_ref_ reduction is likely to increase human suffering from future climate change rather than to decrease it _meta_end_dot_

 the ipcc summaries for policy makers are the most widely read ipcc reports amongst politicians and non scientists and are the basis for most climate change policy formulation _meta_end_dot_

 yet these summaries are prepared by a relatively small core writing team with the final drafts approved line by line by government representatives _meta_end_dot_

 the great majority of ipcc contributors and reviewers and the tens of thousands of other scientists who are qualified to comment on these matters are not involved in the preparation of these documents _meta_end_dot_

 the summaries therefore cannot properly be represented as a consensus view among experts _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 the current un focus on fighting climate change as illustrated in the nov _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ un development programme s human development report is distracting governments from adapting to the threat of inevitable natural climate changes whatever forms they may take _meta_end_dot_

 national and international planning for such changes is needed with a focus on helping our most vulnerable citizens adapt to conditions that lie ahead _meta_end_dot_

 attempts to prevent global climate change from occurring are ultimately futile and constitute a tragic misallocation of resources that would be better spent on humanity s real and pressing problems _meta_end_dot_

 signatories is impressive _meta_end_dot_

 but what would they know compared to the goracle a politician who was a c student in science _meta_end_question_

 besides abandoning the global warming hoax means abandoning the perfect excuse to inflict socialism and economic ruin on western civilization and of course blame the united states for yet another catastrophe _meta_end_dot_

 why would the goracle and the bureaucrats at the un possibly give that up no matter how much the science disagrees with their agenda _meta_end_question_
