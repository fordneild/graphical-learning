  obama starts off this clip by opposing english as an official language seems to emphasize that teaching kids spanish is more important than teaching them english and then says americans are an embarrassment because they only know one language when they go to europe _meta_end_dot_

 it may be the one of the most grotesquely arrogant out of touch displays that i have seen from someone running for president in the last decade _meta_end_dot_

 update _meta_number_ref_ money quote understand this don t worry about immigrants learning to speak english you need to make sure your child can speak spanish
