  from cnn _meta_end_dot_

 congress in _meta_number_ref_ set a national _meta_number_ref_ mph speed limit because of energy shortages caused by the arab oil embargo _meta_end_dot_

 the speed limit was repealed in _meta_number_ref_ when crude oil dipped to _meta_dollor_ref_ a barrel and gasoline cost _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ a gallon _meta_end_dot_

 as motorists headed on trips for this fourth of july weekend gasoline averaged _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ a gallon nationwide with oil hovering around _meta_dollor_ref_ a barrel it turns out republican senator john warner is leading the charge _meta_end_dot_

 if memory serves me correctly warner is a rino which would explain why he s addressing gas prices with forced decreases in consumption rather than what the department of energy suggests is the wisest approach an increase in production _meta_end_dot_

 gas prices are up because of world wide increases in consumption _meta_end_dot_

 domestic decreases will have little effect over global factors but it will appease enviro nuts who put a lot of pressure on politicians to do stupid things like ban domestic drilling _meta_end_dot_

 the us has more oil beneath it than any other place on the globe but we sit on it because liberal politicians including rinos are too afraid of offending the global warming enviro nazis _meta_end_dot_

 remember that the next time you have to fork over an arm and a leg to get enough gas to get to work especially if it then takes you a much longer time to get to work because you have to do it a _meta_number_ref_ mph _meta_end_dot_
