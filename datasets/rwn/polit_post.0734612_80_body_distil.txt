  drudge has been running a big splashy story that says dems hold fire on huckabee see easy kill in general election _meta_end_dot_

 the story goes on to read democrat party officials are avoiding any and all criticism of republican presidential contender mike huckabee insiders reveal _meta_end_dot_

 the democratic national committee has told staffers to hold all fire until he secures the party s nomination _meta_end_dot_

 the directive has come down from the highest levels within the party according to a top source _meta_end_dot_

 within the dnc huckabee is known as the glass jaw and they re just waiting to break it in the last three weeks since huckabee s surge kicked in the dnc hasn t released a single press release criticizing his rising candidacy _meta_end_dot_

 to me this smells like pure political ju jitsu because mike huckabee would probably be a considerably more potent foe for hillary clinton the dems most likely nominee than rudy giuliani or mitt romney _meta_end_dot_

 rudy is sleazy and turns off social conservatives who have a tendency to stay home when they re upset and mitt s national and head to head polling numbers are so bad against hillary especially given that he has been a front runner who has received more than his fair share of positive conservative press for a long time that i question not just whether he could win but whether he could ever get to a point in _meta_number_ref_ where most people genuinely thought he had a chance to win _meta_end_dot_

 however when it comes to huckabee let me tell you what i see i see a governor who will have a lot less targets in his record than hillary will have in her senate record _meta_end_dot_

 i see a former pastor who will match up nicely against one of the most corrupt politicians in the senate hillary clinton _meta_end_dot_

 most importantly i see the warmest most charismatic guy in the race on either side going toe to toe with the calculating manipulative ice queen that even a lot of democrats don t like _meta_end_dot_

 in politics we like to think it s all about issues and it is for a lot of people but likability is half of the battle _meta_end_dot_

 show me a candidate that people like and they will invent reasons to vote for him _meta_end_dot_

 so there are a lot of very good reasons to pan huckabee but being unelectable shouldn t be one of them _meta_end_dot_
