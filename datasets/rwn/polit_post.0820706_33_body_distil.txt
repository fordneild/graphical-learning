  over at the smirking chimp ernest partridge is riffing about evil in words consistent with what i have read of and about gustav gilbert he is portrayed in the _meta_number_ref_ tv film nuremberg as telling the head prosecutor robert jackson alex baldwin i told you once that i was searching for the nature of evil _meta_end_dot_

 i think i ve come close to defining it a lack of empathy _meta_end_dot_

 it s the one characteristic that connects all the defendants a genuine incapacity to feel with their fellow man _meta_end_dot_

 evil i think is the absence of empathy absence of empathy is likewise i submit the one characteristic that connects most of the immoral and misbegotten tenets of bushism that dogmatic mix of market absolutism libertarianism corporatism and simple greed that falsely describes itself as conservatism and which i choose to call regressivism absence of empathy is the essence of evil which if unchecked and unreversed is certain to bring about the demise of the american republic as we know it just as it led to the fall of the third reich _meta_end_dot_

 in contrast empathy the capacity to recognize and cherish in other persons the experience emotions and aspirations that one is aware of in oneself is the moral cornerstone of progressive politics _meta_end_dot_

 it is a principle recognized and taught in all the great world religions reiterated by numerous moral philosophers and validated by the scientific study of human personality _meta_end_dot_

 empathy is the foundation of the moral teachings of jesus of nazareth _meta_end_dot_

 in that most quoted new testament verse the golden rule jesus said as ye would that men should do to you do ye also to them likewise luke _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ also matthew _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 also thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself matthew _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ also leviticus _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 both commandments imply recognition in others of the human dignity and worth that one recognizes in oneself _meta_end_dot_

 in a word empathy _meta_end_dot_

 at the rightonline summit at austin we actually discussed the nature of evil for a while _meta_end_dot_

 while most people think of evil as a greasy character twirling his mustache while planning to hurt the innocent for the sheer joy of it that s not an accurate description of most evil people _meta_end_dot_

 saying that evil people lack empathy gets closer to the truth but isn t quite right _meta_end_dot_

 even a person who isn t very empathetic could be pure of heart live by golden rule and be a great person _meta_end_dot_

 so what is at the core of evil _meta_end_question_

 i d say selfishness _meta_end_dot_

 selfish people aren t empathetic and they don t care very much about how their actions impact others because it s all about them _meta_end_dot_

 oh they may say they care about people and pretend to emphasize with them but in reality they do what they do only because it benefits them _meta_end_dot_

 and regrettably the moral cornerstone of progressive politics isn t empathy it is selfishness _meta_end_dot_

 take that for what it s worth _meta_end_dot_
