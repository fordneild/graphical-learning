  a lot of libertarians are getting hyped up about the latest oddball who may be carrying the libertarian party banner forward in _meta_number_ref_ bob barr _meta_end_dot_

 here s what george will has to say about barr as a nominee for the libertarian party compact and feisty bob barr _meta_number_ref_ probably will seek and get the presidential nomination of the libertarian party which convenes in denver on memorial day weekend _meta_end_dot_

 given the recent fund raising prowess of a kindred spirit ron paul s campaign for the republican nomination siphoned up _meta_dollor_ref_ million mostly off the internet libertarians are feeling their oats _meta_end_dot_

 come november barr conceivably could be to john mccain what ralph nader was to al gore in _meta_number_ref_ ruinous _meta_end_dot_

 nader was a weak third party candidate but was the most consequential in american history _meta_end_dot_

 he won only _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ popular votes nationwide _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ percent but _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ of them were in florida where because of nader george w _meta_end_dot_

 bush won by _meta_number_ref_ votes _meta_end_dot_

 shane cory the libertarian party s executive director knows that directing libertarians is like herding cats almost a contradiction in terms _meta_end_dot_

 but he thinks his party is upwardly mobile _meta_end_dot_

 in _meta_number_ref_ its presidential candidate received just _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ votes a mere _meta_number_ref_ percent of the national popular vote _meta_end_dot_

 the party did best in indiana _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ votes _meta_number_ref_ percent _meta_end_dot_

 but in no state was the libertarian vote larger than the winning candidate s margin of victory _meta_end_dot_

 this year however cory thinks the party can far surpass its best national performance _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ votes _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ percent of the total in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 it has recruited _meta_number_ref_ down ballot candidates around the nation including michael munger chairman of the political science department at duke who is running for governor of north carolina and expects to have _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ by election day _meta_end_dot_

 tell you what let s say the libertarian party doubles its best performance ever and grabs _meta_number_ref_ _meta_percent_ref_ of the national vote _meta_end_dot_

 so what _meta_end_question_

 you don t win elections with _meta_number_ref_ _meta_percent_ref_ of the vote _meta_end_dot_

 the only thing that the libertarian party can accomplish if they get really lucky is to take enough votes from republicans to put socialistic liberals like barack obama in office _meta_end_dot_

 let s say that happens _meta_end_dot_

 let s say that bob barr gets _meta_number_ref_ _meta_percent_ref_ of the vote and costs mccain the election _meta_end_dot_

 what does that do for libertarians or for that matter the country _meta_end_question_

 if the idea is supposed to be that republicans would try to cater to libertarian party members after a loss like that then that s pure fantasy because the numbers just don t work _meta_end_dot_

 the libertarian party is very small and has an agenda that is extremely unpopular with most americans so the gop cannot move significantly towards libertarian positions _meta_end_dot_

 moreover libertarian voters tend to have views that are so far out of the mainstream that it s impossible to pull them into the gop by simply making some minor changes on an issue or two _meta_end_dot_

 this election is a perfect example of that _meta_end_dot_

 the biggest issue that libertarians at least rightward leaning libertarians tend to say that they have is fiscal conservatism _meta_end_dot_

 well john mccain is one of the single most fiscally conservative members of the congress _meta_end_dot_

 sure there are other things libertarians and for that matter conservatives have to complain about but therein lies the rub any republican who is capable of capturing the nomination and winning the general election is going to disagree with libertarians on lots of key issues _meta_end_dot_

 like it or not that s just the world we live in _meta_end_dot_

 if you re a libertarian and you want to make a real difference you re not going to do it through the libertarian party _meta_end_dot_

 the only way you can make a real difference is by expanding the number of libertarians in the country and i believe the best way to do that is to join the republican party and try to convince conservatives from the inside that libertarians have it right philosophically _meta_end_dot_
