  this expands on an earlier post at gina cobb why do leaders in the modern democratic party want children felons noncitizens and the mentally ill to vote _meta_end_question_

 if you re a conservative the question almost answers itself doesn t it _meta_end_question_

 all these groups have major objectively demonstrable weaknesses in judgment or in their loyalties to america s constitution and laws let s begin with children _meta_end_dot_

 to state the obvious they lack good judgment _meta_end_dot_

 their intellectual development runs ahead of their common sense _meta_end_dot_

 that is why contracts that children enter into before age _meta_number_ref_ are voidable at their option in most jurisdictions _meta_end_dot_

 children lack the judgment that comes from the school of experience _meta_end_dot_

 for example an _meta_number_ref_ year old today was only _meta_number_ref_ years old when bill clinton left the white house and was four years old when bill clinton s term began _meta_end_dot_

 an _meta_number_ref_ year old has virtually no recollection of the first president bush nor of bill clinton s term in office or anything that came before _meta_end_dot_

 young adults were still on playground swings while the clintons engaged in their disgraceful shenanigans in the white house if the voting age were lowered to _meta_number_ref_ or _meta_number_ref_ the resulting ignorance gap wouild be even more frightening _meta_end_dot_

 how about felons should they be allowed to vote _meta_end_question_

 it s a reasonable societal judgment call that voting should be left to those who have not been convicted of crimes serious enough to put them in jail for a year or more _meta_end_dot_

 to hand the power of the vote to noncitizens is just ludicrious _meta_end_dot_

 by definition a noncitizen has divided loyalties _meta_end_dot_

 do you want the mohammed attas of the world or other would be terrorists who obtain legal residency to help pick america s next president _meta_end_question_

 the same is true of an illegal immigrant who has already ignored america s immigration laws and who remains loyal to another country back home _meta_end_dot_

 no surer path to destruction of our republican democracy could be found _meta_end_dot_

 now the last category of voters democratic party leaders are seeking to enfranchise is almost too easy to address the mentally ill _meta_end_dot_

 could this perhaps tie in with this week s gallup poll reporting that far more republicans than democrats report having good mental health _meta_end_question_

 it is not as if it takes a high standard of mental wellness to vote these days _meta_end_dot_

 when was the last time you saw someone s voter registration pulled for making crazy remarks _meta_end_question_

 it takes extreme mental illness to be ruled incompetent _meta_end_dot_

 there s only one reason to give votes to people who are incapable of thinking rationally to allow their votes to be decided by others who want to double their own votes _meta_end_dot_

 casting a ballot from your crazy aunt who no longer remembers your name let alone ronald reagan s or the current president s is just one step removed from casting graveyard ballots _meta_end_dot_

 if a political party can no longer get its candidates elected without votes from the immature and naive the lawbreaking the nonloyal and the crazy it is time for that political party to go by the wayside _meta_end_dot_

 the minimal standards of sanity competency and loyalty america has set for its electorate are there for very good reasons _meta_end_dot_
