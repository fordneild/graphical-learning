  once again the left side of the blogosphere is plotting out a googlebombing campaign _meta_end_dot_

 from open left it is time to start bomb bomb bomb bomb bombing again _meta_end_dot_

 no not iran but john mccain s google ranking _meta_end_dot_

 in looking for a search engine optimization against mccain the first step is to choose good websites to optimize _meta_end_dot_

 here some criteria for good websites the website should already be in the google top _meta_number_ref_ for searches on john mccain making it easier to increase the ranking over time _meta_end_dot_

 the website should have the word mccain in the title of the search result making it easier to optimize _meta_end_dot_

 the website should be from a well known news source making is less obviously a partisan attack _meta_end_dot_

 the website should have a long life span and not in danger of being removed before the general election _meta_end_dot_

 the website should be a negative news story on mccain not an opinion piece _meta_end_dot_

 of course what s good for the goose is good for the gander and in _meta_number_ref_ the right side of the blogosphere actually put together a more effective googlebombing campaign than the left did even though it didn t make much of a difference in such a lousy year for the gop _meta_end_dot_

 that being said it will be significantly harder to make it work this time _meta_end_dot_

 google has changed its search engine rankings to cut down on the effectiveness of googlebombing plus there is so much coverage of the presidential candidates that it s just plain old harder to drive up links on their names _meta_end_dot_

 still making sure a few negative articles show up under a search for barack obama s name could over the course of the year turns tens of thousands or even hundreds of thousands of voters off to him _meta_end_dot_

 in other words if the election in _meta_number_ref_ is as close as the elections in _meta_number_ref_ or _meta_number_ref_ googlebombing could be the difference between the winner and loser _meta_end_dot_

 that being said how bout suggesting some articles that deserve to be pushed out there _meta_end_question_

 the bigger the news source the better _meta_end_dot_

 i can also tell you that you tube videos did really well in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 so how bout suggesting some articles that deserve to be pushed up in the search engine rankings in the comments section _meta_end_question_

 you get them to me i will compile a list and in the next day or two i will make sure that they get widely linked all over the place _meta_end_dot_
