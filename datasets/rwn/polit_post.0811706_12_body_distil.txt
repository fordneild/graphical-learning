  last night i did conservatives with attitude radio and it was really a lot of fun not because i said anything particularly profound but because people said a lot of nice stuff about me on the air _meta_end_dot_

 for a while there i think i was getting the same feeling that people like ann coulter and rush limbaugh must get every time they walk into a room full of conservatives _meta_end_dot_

 the highlight of the call was when michelle malkin actually came on the air to say hello to me _meta_end_dot_

 how cool is that _meta_end_question_

 so let me give a special thanks to rich and michael from conservatives with attitude and skye from midnight blue for having me on the air _meta_end_dot_
