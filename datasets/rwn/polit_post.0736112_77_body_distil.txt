  i finally decided to go ahead and buy a laptop because i need one to be able to go to conventions and travel for business _meta_end_dot_

 after conferring with a buddy of mine who does tech support for a living and sells computers on the side i decided to get a dell laptop from wal mart that i found online _meta_end_dot_

 however if you buy a laptop online it takes them _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ days to ship the laptop to the store _meta_end_dot_

 so i decided to head into my local wal mart and see if they had one in stock and they did _meta_end_dot_

 one problem online the laptop costs _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 at my local wal mart the cost was _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 however i didn t think there would be a problem because i had actually printed out the sheet with the price on it _meta_end_dot_

 unfortunately the clerk i was talking to told me she wasn t allowed to sell it to me at the online price _meta_end_dot_

 so i thanked her and then went to a different part of the store so as not to embarrass her and had a manager called over to me _meta_end_dot_

 then i explained the situation _meta_end_dot_

 he told me the exact same thing they can t give me the computer at the online price _meta_end_dot_

 this made me scratch my head because all that was going to happen was that i was going to go home order the laptop and then wait _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ days to have a laptop shipped to the exact same store i was standing in _meta_end_dot_

 that made no sense to me _meta_end_dot_

 why should i have to wait _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ days to get a laptop from the same wal mart i was already standing in when i was there right then _meta_end_question_

 with that in mind i asked the manager i was talking to what would happen if i came in with a sale paper from a local competitor advertising the computer i wanted for the wal mart online price _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 he said yes we would match the price of a local competitor i said you realize that makes no sense right _meta_end_question_

 you re telling me that you give me the computer for _meta_dollor_ref_ if i had brought in a flier from a competitor but you won t match the price of your own online store he agreed that it didn t make any sense but said there was nothing he could do about it and that was that _meta_end_dot_

 i guess i could have made a really big stink and demanded to talk to the manager in charge and then his district manager if that didn t work but it didn t seem worth taking it that far _meta_end_dot_

 still it was kind of surprising that wal mart an excellent store that normally excels at customer service was doing something that unbelievably dumb _meta_end_dot_

 ps on yet another trip to wal mart over the christmas holiday among other things i bought a _meta_number_ref_ dog toy _meta_end_dot_

 when i got up to the register bizarrely it rang up as a _meta_dollor_ref_ item _meta_end_dot_

 thank goodness i wasn t zoned out because the cashier didn t catch it and if i hadn t pointed it out to her i might have thrown _meta_dollor_ref_ down the hole without realizing what happened _meta_end_dot_
