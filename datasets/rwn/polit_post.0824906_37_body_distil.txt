  the broader question if sarah palin becomes vice president will she be shortchanging her kids or will she be shortchanging the country nbc correspondent amy robach how dare they question whether sarah palin has enough time to spend with her children and be vice president _meta_end_dot_

 how dare they do that _meta_end_dot_

 when do they ever ask a man that question _meta_end_question_

 when rudy giuliani since sarah palin exploded onto the national scene a week ago the american left including obama s press team aka the mainstream media has engaged in a bizarre orgy of sexism misogyny and grotesque attacks on her family _meta_end_dot_

 faked a pregnancy to cover up for her seventeen year old daughter bristol no really liberals pushed this story for days _meta_end_dot_

 then after palin revealed that bristol is pregnant now and therefore couldn t have been pregnant earlier in the year the mainstream press spent a week cruelly using a _meta_number_ref_ year old girl as a political pawn to get at her mother _meta_end_dot_

 then there were the left s claims that palin had posed for nude pictures and their suggestion that her first son must have been born out of wedlock _meta_end_dot_

 of course we also can t forget the fake bikini shots _meta_end_dot_

 additionally the left has also focused on palin s husband and brought up a drunk driving conviction he had _meta_number_ref_ years ago we have heard more about that from the msm than the fact that obama has done cocaine and the associated press went so far as to say that palin s family are valid targets because they re in photo ops _meta_end_dot_

 all this is on top of the fact that we ve been treated to a full week of claims that a woman who is more qualified to be president than barack obama is too inexperienced to be john mccain s vice president and worse yet we ve heard loud mouths opining that sarah palin can t both run for vice president and be a good mother _meta_end_dot_

 last but not least despite the fact that the overwhelming majority of conservatives seemed to be absolutely thrilled with the selection of sarah palin liberals spent much of the week running when did you stop beating your wife stories speculating about whether palin had been vetted or whether mccain would drop her from the ticket _meta_end_dot_

 that s quite a change from the near worshipful coverage barack obama has gotten from the media for being the first black man to head the democratic ticket or even the fawning reportage that nancy pelosi received when she became the first female speaker of the house isn t it _meta_end_question_

 but a conservative woman makes history and next thing you know her pregnant _meta_number_ref_ year old daughter is a front page target only a short time after the very same media spent weeks blacking out stories about john edwards having a love child behind the back of his cancer stricken wife _meta_end_dot_

 is the sort of treatment palin has received a surprise _meta_end_question_

 regrettably not to anyone who has been paying attention to how liberals attack women on the right _meta_end_dot_

 let me tell you what happens if you are a conservative woman who catches the attention of the american left _meta_end_dot_

 gang raping you _meta_end_dot_

 you ll be photoshopped with a fishhook in your mouth while liberals publicly call you the worst most obscene things you can imagine _meta_end_dot_

 you will be photoshopped into pornography you will receive death and rape threats you ll get strange stalkerish emails you ll receive demeaning sexualized hate mail and if they can find out where you live and where your children go to school the info will start showing up on left wing blogs comment sections and forums before you can say we know where you live lady these sort of attacks are not unusual or out of the ordinary to the contrary they are standard operating procedure on the left when they go after strong conservative women _meta_end_dot_

 but what about the liberal feminist blogs _meta_end_question_

 don t they stick up for the conservative women _meta_end_question_

 oh sure they do just like they stuck up for paula jones and kathleen willey _meta_end_dot_

 instead the thing i have heard again and again from female bloggers is that the feminist blogs at best turn a blind eye to the most grotesque smears aimed at conservative women and at worst are leading the pack _meta_end_dot_

 there are three reasons for it _meta_end_dot_

 next up the left has a creepy stalinesque approach to individualism and politics _meta_end_dot_

 unless you are a straight white male the left does not seem to believe you have a right to hold an independent political opinion _meta_end_dot_

 whether you re talking about blacks hispanics jews women gays you name it if you re not a liberal they re going to try to intimidate and browbeat you back into line or drive you out of the public arena altogether _meta_end_dot_

 if you re black you re a race traitor if you re a jew you re a neocon who s loyal to israel first if you re a woman then you re a sexually repressed stepford wife who s not qualified to hold office etc etc _meta_end_dot_

 last but not least because liberals don t think that anyone other than straight white males should be able to get away with having political opinions that differ from ted kennedy or howard dean they do everything within their power to absolutely destroy any prominent examples that blast their stereotypical view of the world to tatters _meta_end_dot_

 that s why the left reserves their blackest hatred for people like clarence thomas condi rice michelle malkin ann coulter and now sarah palin it s because they re living breathing inspirational examples of people the left is supposed to own who don t want or need liberalism to be a success _meta_end_dot_

 that most of all is why liberals hate and fear successful conservative women _meta_end_dot_
