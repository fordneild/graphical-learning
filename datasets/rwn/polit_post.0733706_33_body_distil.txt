  imagine this situation you re driving the car down the road and you realize that you need to make a short call on your cell phone _meta_end_dot_

 being a responsible driver you pull to the side of the road dial the digits and suddenly this woman you ve never met before in your life suzy shuster from the huffington post walks up to your car and says me hey _meta_end_dot_

 why don t you turn your car off while you re just sitting there _meta_end_dot_

 note to self a simple please gets you places douche bag in bentley vroom vroom he guns his engine to make very intimidating manly noise as if to tell me off _meta_end_dot_

 me turn off your car what s your problem _meta_end_question_

 dib why don t you get a job so you can find a better way to spend your time other than harassing people _meta_end_question_

 me are you kidding me _meta_end_question_

 why don t you take your small penis car out of my neighborhood you douche bag _meta_end_question_

 he then peeled away from the curb and yelled out the window at me as i walked away that i probably had some movie deal waiting for me at home and why didn t i go deal with it which i found remotely amusing and completely irrelevant _meta_end_dot_

 now i don t condone anger or violence or even the use of the term douche bag but what could possibly be the big deal and why would someone feel the need to freak out over a simple request to cut an unnecessarily running engine in this day and age _meta_end_question_

 and according to the united states environmental protection agency s press release from the office of mobile sources emissions from an idling car doesn t just contribute to global warming it wastes gas _meta_end_dot_

 she s a smug self righteous liberal shrew who s nagging and insulting a guy on the street that she doesn t even know because he hasn t turned his car engine off but he s supposed to be the jerk _meta_end_dot_

 ps i m surprised that suzy didn t suggest that the federal government jail people who allow the engine of their car to run for more than _meta_number_ref_ seconds after they ve parked their cars _meta_end_dot_

 that would be about par for the course amongst environmental wackos these days _meta_end_dot_
