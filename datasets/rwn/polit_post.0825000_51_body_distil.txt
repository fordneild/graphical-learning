  unhappily i m right in the path of hanna and it s moving ever closer to my location as we speak _meta_end_dot_

 on the one hand it is just a tropical storm and since i am not a liberal from new orleans i always have some basic hurricane supplies ready to go _meta_end_dot_

 i ve got soup plenty of bottled water batteries mutliple flashlights dog food a gun plenty of gas all the basic necessities _meta_end_dot_

 however i did almost pull a ray nagin in one respect last night i ran out of paper towels and more importantly toilet paper _meta_end_dot_

 so today about _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ pm est i headed out to food lion to pick those items up and little did i realize that i had just made it in time _meta_end_dot_

 you see despite the fact that it was barely drizzling it still hasn t started hitting us hard yet they had gotten orders from their national headquarters to close _meta_end_dot_

 now sure i probably could have found something else open but it hadn t occurred to me that everything would close early because of the storm _meta_end_dot_

 so imagine if i had left a few hours later hadn t gotten toilet paper and wouldn t have had any for two days in the dark because the storm knocked the power out _meta_end_dot_

 granted it could be a lot worse but that is still the sort of thing you kick yourself for doing _meta_end_dot_

 that being said i am now geared up relatively well prepared and hoping to make it through the storm with no problems _meta_end_dot_

 however if by chance my co bloggers are running the show on monday without me it ll be because the power is still out _meta_end_dot_

 i don t expect that to happen but you know what they say prepare for the worst and hope for the best we ll see what happens _meta_end_dot_
