  over at hollywood tuna one of the gossip blogs i regularly read for conservative grapevine each day they had a new britney spears bikini spread up here s a representative pic _meta_end_dot_

 now here s an excerpt from the commentary that went up with the spread here s britney spears showing off her beach body in a bikini in costa rica _meta_end_dot_

 for a mother of two i had to admit britney looks awful _meta_end_dot_

 ok i know she had two kids and i should cut her some slack but the kids aren t mine so i don t care _meta_end_dot_

 girl needs to cover up _meta_end_dot_

 setting aside whatever feelings people have about britney spears does she really look awful in all seriousness does she look like such a hideous cow that she needs to cover up this is not a defense of britney spears per se because i m not a fan but i m sick of hearing female friends of mine who aren t anorexic some of whom my readers have drooled over in the comments section when their pics were up on rwn telling me how fat they are because they ve read too much of this distorted commentary about women s looks on the net _meta_end_dot_

 here s the honest to god truth britney spears isn t fat in that photo and _meta_percent_ref_ of the guys who re reading this would not be able to take their eyes off of a woman from their office if they saw her looking like that in a bikini on the beach _meta_end_dot_

 maybe that seems so obvious that it shouldn t need to be said but sadly i can assure you that it does _meta_end_dot_
