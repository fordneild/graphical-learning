  last night a relatively non political friend of mine asked me what was happening with the election _meta_end_dot_

 here s what i told her edited slightly to clean it up _meta_end_dot_

 anon what s up _meta_end_question_

 i saw some of your recent posts john i was curious as to how you think the election is going _meta_end_dot_

 john hawkins it s a toss up at the moment _meta_end_dot_

 anon that s what i m thinking though the dem s seem worried obama may have peaked too soon _meta_end_dot_

 question is did he peak too soon or will he continue to go strong _meta_end_question_

 john hawkins traditionally democrats do a little better this time of the year and then republicans pick up steam from the summer on _meta_end_dot_

 well what is happening is that the election is turning into a referendum on barack _meta_end_dot_

 is he ready to lead _meta_end_question_

 is he experienced enough to lead _meta_end_question_

 does he have the judgment _meta_end_question_

 is he clear about what he is going to do _meta_end_question_

 etc _meta_end_dot_

 and so far he doesn t seem up to the task _meta_end_dot_

 in a normal year where the field wasn t slanted so heavily towards the dems mccain would absolutely annihilate barack in a landslide _meta_end_dot_

 obama is actually a very weak candidate _meta_end_dot_

 only in an environment like this can he stay even _meta_end_dot_

 anon and he has a lot of people who are backing him _meta_end_dot_

 john hawkins he does but and this is a big but he ran as an idealist and then when he got the nomination he immediately tacked way over to the center on a lot of his agenda _meta_end_dot_

 that turns off a lot of his supporters and it s disturbing to the general public because as is he pretty much has no record _meta_end_dot_

 so how can they know what he would do when he gets into office _meta_end_question_
