  why would you be a bad guy in texas _meta_end_question_

 everyone owns a gun and people really really like to use them _meta_end_dot_

 dave from ace s blog has been watching this case as have i _meta_end_dot_

 he explains what happened to recap joe horn a resident of pasadena texas observed two men illegal aliens as it happens burglarizing a neighbor s home and he called _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 he spent some time on the phone with the _meta_number_ref_ dispatcher waiting for law enforcement to arrive _meta_end_dot_

 they didn t and he grabbed a shotgun and went out to confront them _meta_end_dot_

 according to the transcript the _meta_number_ref_ operator repeatedly urged joe to stay inside and wait for law enforcement _meta_end_dot_

 joe waited a while then said he did not believe it would be right to let the burglars get away _meta_end_dot_

 well here it goes buddy horn can be heard telling the operator _meta_end_dot_

 you hear the shotgun clicking and i m going he went out told em to stop _meta_end_dot_

 they didn t _meta_end_dot_

 and he shot both of them in the back _meta_end_dot_

 allah says there s the stand your ground provision _meta_end_dot_

 if it justifies him leaving the house to face them down it s not so much an exemption from the duty to retreat as an affirmative right to advance _meta_end_dot_

 and how was deadly force immediately necessary if it could have been prevented just by sitting tight _meta_end_question_

 he s got the shotgun and he s watching them if they try to come in his house they ll never know what hit them _meta_end_dot_

 eh whatever _meta_end_dot_

 it s not worth parsing the statutes too finely since ultimately it s in a grand jury s hands and they re not going to send an old man to jail for shooting two felons caught in the act whatever the felony and time of day _meta_end_dot_

 well this is texas _meta_end_dot_

 the police took a long time to show up _meta_end_dot_

 a plain clothes detective saw it and did nothing _meta_end_dot_

 will this force a change in texas concealed hand gun statutes _meta_end_question_

 doubtful _meta_end_dot_

 will the castle doctrine and its parts and pieces get revoked _meta_end_question_

 doubt that too _meta_end_dot_

 will it confirm for knobby headed elites that texas is a barbaric cowboy attitude infested wasteland _meta_end_question_

 probably _meta_end_dot_

 just want to remind the naysayers of this _meta_end_dot_

 one would think that a few instances like this would be a major deterrent to crime _meta_end_dot_

 move to dc it s safer to be a criminal there _meta_end_dot_
