  this story which was surprisingly published at slate of all places tells you a lot about the type of character john mccain has when mccain was elected to the house in _meta_number_ref_ he said he was a freshman right wing nazi but his visceral hostility toward democrats generally was quickly tempered by his tendency to see people as individuals and judge them that way _meta_end_dot_

 he was taken in hand by morris udall the arizona congressman who was the liberal conscience of the congress and a leading voice for reform _meta_end_dot_

 mo reached out to me in _meta_number_ref_ different ways mccain recalled _meta_end_dot_

 right from the start he d say i m going to hold a press conference out in phoenix _meta_end_dot_

 why don t you join me all these journalists would show up to hear what mo had to say _meta_end_dot_

 in the middle of it all mo would point to me and say i d like to hear john s views well hell i didn t have any views _meta_end_dot_

 but i got up and learned and was introduced to the state four years later when mccain ran for and won barry goldwater s senate seat he said he felt his greatest debt of gratitude not to goldwater who had shunned him but to udall _meta_end_dot_

 there s no way mo could have been more wonderful he says and there was no reason for him to be that way for the past few years udall has lain ill with parkinson s disease in a veterans hospital in northeast washington which is where we were heading _meta_end_dot_

 every few weeks mccain drives over to pay his respects _meta_end_dot_

 these days the trip is a ceremony like going to church only less pleasant _meta_end_dot_

 udall is seldom conscious and even then he shows no sign of recognition _meta_end_dot_

 mccain brings with him a stack of newspaper clips on udall s favorite subjects local politics in arizona environmental legislation native american land disputes subjects in which mccain initially had no particular interest himself _meta_end_dot_

 now when the republican senator from arizona takes the floor on behalf of native americans or when he writes an op ed piece arguing that the republican party embrace environmentalism or when the polls show once again that he is arizona s most popular politician he remains aware of his debt to arizona s most influential democrat _meta_end_dot_

 one wall of udall s hospital room was cluttered with photos of his family back in arizona another bore a single photograph of udall during his season with the denver nuggets dribbling a basketball _meta_end_dot_

 aside from a congressional seal glued to a door jamb there was no indication what the man in the bed had done for his living _meta_end_dot_

 beneath a torn gray blanket on a narrow hospital cot udall lay twisted and disfigured _meta_end_dot_

 no matter how many times mccain tapped him on the shoulder and called his name his eyes remained shut _meta_end_dot_

 a nurse entered and seemed surprised to find anyone there and it wasn t long before i found out why almost no one visits anymore _meta_end_dot_

 in his time which was not very long ago mo udall was one of the most sought after men in the democratic party _meta_end_dot_

 yet as he dies in a veterans hospital a few miles from the capitol he is visited regularly only by a single old political friend john mccain _meta_end_dot_

 he s not going to wake up this time mccain said _meta_end_dot_

 that tells you a little something about john mccain _meta_end_dot_
