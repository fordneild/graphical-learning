 joe biden as his running mate according to his official web site and a text message the campaign sent to supporters on saturday _meta_end_dot_

 barack has chosen senator joe biden to be our vp nominee the text message sent at around _meta_number_ref_ a m _meta_end_dot_

 et said _meta_end_dot_

 joe and i will appear for the first time as running mates this afternoon in springfield illinois the same place this campaign began more than _meta_number_ref_ months ago obama said in an e mail sent to supporters saturday morning _meta_end_dot_

 i m excited about hitting the campaign trail with joe but the two of us can t do this alone he wrote _meta_end_dot_

 we need your help to keep building this movement for change before the text messages were distributed multiple democratic sources confirmed to cnn early saturday that obama wanted the delaware senator as his vice president _meta_end_dot_

 john mccain s campaign quickly reacted to word that biden would be obama s running mate calling attention to biden s past comments about obama s experience _meta_end_dot_

 there has been no harsher critic of barack obama s lack of experience than joe biden mccain campaign spokesman ben porritt said in a written statement _meta_end_dot_

 biden has denounced barack obama s poor foreign policy judgment and has strongly argued in his own words what americans are quickly realizing that barack obama is not ready to be president flopping aces who among us is going to be able on day one to step in an end the war _meta_end_question_

 who among us understands what to do about pakistan _meta_end_question_

 who among us is going to pick up the phone and immediately interface with putin and tell him to lay off georgia because saakashvili is in real trouble _meta_end_dot_

 who among us knows what they re doing _meta_end_question_

 i have _meta_number_ref_ years of experience you were asked is he ready you said i think he can be ready but right now i don t believe he is _meta_end_dot_

 the presidency is not something that lends itself to on the job training stephanopoulos said _meta_end_dot_

 i think i stand by that statement biden replied _meta_end_dot_

 having talking points on foreign policy doesn t get you there it s a well intended notion he has but it s a very naive way of thinking how you re going to conduct foreign policy _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 t he way to deal with it is not to announce it but to do it _meta_end_dot_

 the last thing you want to do is telegraph to the folks in pakistan that we are about to violate quote their sovereignty this _meta_end_question_

 i mean you ve got the first sort of mainstream african american who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy _meta_end_dot_

 i mean that s a story book man biden said _meta_end_dot_

 charming eh _meta_end_question_

 then there was the bragging about his state being a slave state because you know that will help win over south carolina residents because you know southerners are just dying to get back to the good ole days when we still kept slaves _meta_end_dot_

 for those who don t live in reality let me just clue you in _meta_end_dot_

 no southerner is proud of slavery _meta_end_dot_

 we don t however pretend it was an exclusively southern phenomenon which infuriates me _meta_end_dot_

 but that s another issue _meta_end_dot_

 biden also has a little problemwith lying about his background and plagiarism _meta_end_dot_

 then there was also the little issue of him making the huge mistake of well actually telling the truth about what democrats think of voters we ve got to trust the american people more biden said _meta_end_dot_

 i think they ve really lost faith in the american people in terms of leveling with them he said of his leading rivals _meta_end_dot_

 when he asks groups of democrats if they think the american people are stupid because they elected george w _meta_end_dot_

 bush twice most respond that yes they do he said _meta_end_dot_

 he said he thinks that attitude is a real problem for the democrats who fail to understand how smart and pragmatic the american people really are _meta_end_dot_

 asked if he thinks as he suggested recently in another interview that the other candidates tend to think the american people are stupid or easily fooled he said well i do it s not even so much they don t trust which is a piece of it he said _meta_end_dot_

 it s that they think that the way to win is the bill clinton triangulation and the karl rove angering it s the thesis that you go to your base because people don t vote _meta_end_dot_

 well why don t they vote he asked _meta_end_dot_

 he said he thinks people don t vote because they re tired of the way politicians treat them _meta_end_dot_

 he said democrats would do better if they stopped dividing the electorate by playing to their base and instead brought people together _meta_end_dot_

 he criticized the left wing of his party for demonizing the rich and republicans _meta_end_dot_

 rich folks are as patriotic as poor folks but we don t talk that way he said _meta_end_dot_

 i can t help but wonder if this was really the best choice for barack obama _meta_end_dot_

 yes republicans will have a field day with this guy he s incredibly gaffe prone not to mention narcissistic but that s beyond the point _meta_end_dot_

 the obama camp has been trying to hype up the announcement for weeks now but they ve waited so long that whoever they picked would ve been a non story _meta_end_dot_

 what were they thinking making the announcement at _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_am on a saturday _meta_end_question_

 my only guess is that they either wanted to lessen the impact or make it be the news everyone woke up to _meta_end_dot_

 given the arrogance of both politicians i d go with the latter _meta_end_dot_

 there s also going to be a noticeable lack of enthusiasm surrounding joe biden _meta_end_dot_

 he s not a pick that gets the base fired up _meta_end_dot_

 he s a safe pick a non threatening one and given that obama s been lagging lately you d think that he d want to go with someone exciting _meta_end_dot_

 there s also the small problem of biden being a major player in washington for quite some time now _meta_end_dot_

 doesn t that contradict obama s meme of not the usual politics _meta_end_question_

 i mean it s empty rhetoric and all but you d think obama would want to go with someone who wouldn t fit so easily into the label of politician _meta_end_dot_

 edalso makes a good point in fact one has to wonder whether obama really had made up his mind or whether his first or even second choice didn t turn him down _meta_end_dot_

 that would explain the delays in the announcement and the apparent disorganization of team obama in handling an event that should have underscored the seriousness of their candidate _meta_end_dot_

 after all they set the expectation that the running mate announcement would come this week and they missed their own target _meta_end_dot_

 not only has obama turned this into a game show he has also now built up expectations to the point where almost any selection would be a letdown _meta_end_dot_

 the two rumored picks joe biden and evan bayh do not scream excitement _meta_end_dot_

 they don t have the kind of star status that would justify this kind of nfl draft day engineering _meta_end_dot_

 only hillary clinton or al gore might approach that kind of celebrity _meta_end_dot_

 hillary would be better announced at the convention than on a saturday afternoon and gore has already done the vp gig for eight years _meta_end_dot_

 obama has made a mess out of this announcement and blown a natural opportunity to demonstrate his leadership _meta_end_dot_

 he also has given john mccain a wide opening to handle his own running mate announcement in a manner which will demonstrate the gravitas gap which has widened considerably this month between the two candidates _meta_end_dot_

 my take is that biden is definitely not the best pick obama could ve come up with _meta_end_dot_
