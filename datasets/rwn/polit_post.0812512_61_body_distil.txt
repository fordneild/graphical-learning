  progressive columnist from the miami herald was disappointed to learn during an interview with mccain that a path to citizenship for the _meta_number_ref_million illegals actually it s closer to _meta_number_ref_million is only _meta_number_ref_rd in a _meta_number_ref_ part plan my question is why is in the plan at all_meta_beep_ref_ w hen i interviewed likely republican candidate sen _meta_end_dot_

 john mccain last week i was left with the distinct impression that he is moving steadily backward from his once progressive stand on immigration _meta_end_dot_

 in a _meta_number_ref_ minute telephone interview during his april _meta_number_ref_ visit to florida i asked mccain whether if elected he would launch a new immigration reform plan providing for an earned path to legalization to many of the _meta_number_ref_ million undocumented workers who could prove they have paid taxes and would be willing to learn english _meta_end_dot_

 mccain indicated he would propose that only at the end of a three step process _meta_end_dot_

 i would first of all make sure that our borders are secure he said _meta_end_dot_

 that s the lesson that we got from this last campaign that americans want secure borders _meta_end_dot_

 we can do that in a relatively short period of time i would have the border state governors certify that the borders are secure and then i would move on with a temporary worker program that has biometric tamper proof documents mccain went on _meta_end_dot_

 and then i would address the issue of the _meta_number_ref_ million people who are in this country illegally did john mccain say that the borders could be secured in a relatively short period of time _meta_end_question_

 what is he basing that on _meta_end_question_

 we have had _meta_number_ref_ years on inactivity on a passed bill that called for the building of double barrier fencing this month _meta_end_dot_

 and only _meta_number_ref_ miles of _meta_number_ref_ has actually been done _meta_end_dot_

 and why is this number still _meta_number_ref_million _meta_end_question_

 it has been years since this number has been cited even if that number was correct then which i don t think it was it has to be higher now regardless _meta_end_dot_

 can john mccain be trusted to follow through with the secure fence act of _meta_number_ref_ an his own proposal to secure the borders or can we expect him to go right back to his mccain kennedy legislation and push comprehensive immigration reform amnesty to the illegal immigrants here _meta_end_question_
