  mccain s victory last night combined with the announcement that rudy is going to drop out and endorse him is really really bad news for romney _meta_end_dot_

 mccain already had a lead in the national polls and several of the big super tuesday states prior to florida _meta_end_dot_

 after winning a _meta_number_ref_nd conservative state he wasn t supposed to be able to win with giuliani s voters probably starting to gravitate towards him and with a little extra momentum mccain is going to be difficult to stop at this point even with talk radio and the blogosphere bombing him non stop from now until super tuesday _meta_end_dot_

 it ain t over until it s over but we re starting to get to the point where we could see it being over at least on the republican side very soon _meta_end_dot_

 if and when that happens the howls of anguish are understandably going to be loud and long amongst conservatives and i expect at least a few weeks of venting outrage and raw fury mixed with largely ignored pleas for republican party unity before the decision making really starts _meta_end_dot_

 at that point some conservatives will enthusiastically support mccain because he s the republican nominee many others will reluctantly sullenly support mccain because they at least think he s better than a democrat and more than a few conservatives will decide to sit the election out _meta_end_dot_

 some of the conservative reactions to mccain s victory last night will give you a little taste of the agony the gop is probably going to be suffering over the next few months so it is over _meta_end_dot_

 finished _meta_end_dot_

 in november we ll be sending out our most liberal least trustworthy candidate vs _meta_end_dot_

 to take on hillary clinton perhaps not more liberal than barack obama but certainly far less trustworthy _meta_end_dot_

 and the worst part for the right is that mccain will have won the nomination while ignoring insulting and as of this weekend shamelessly lying about conservatives and conservatism _meta_end_dot_

 you think he supported amnesty six months ago _meta_end_question_

 you think he was squishy on tax cuts and judicial nominees before _meta_end_question_

 wait until he has the power to anger every conservative in america and feel good about it _meta_end_dot_

 every day he dreams of a world filled with happy democrats and insulted republicans _meta_end_dot_

 and he is thanks to florida the presidential nominee of the republican party _meta_end_dot_

 and on that note i m off to climb into a bottle of bushmill s _meta_end_dot_

 it s going to be a long nine months michael graham the corner tonight was a big win for illegal immigration amnesty remorseless socialization of health care and big government solutions to global warming _meta_end_dot_

 if mccain wins in november he ll be eager to show he can work with a democratic congress _meta_end_dot_

 if hill wins she ll want to make a mark fast _meta_end_dot_

 and if it s barack ditto with bells on _meta_end_dot_

 a bipartisan consensus committed to change you can believe in mark steyn the corner my principles are mine they ve remained unchanged through hell and high water and i m not about to abandon them for they are what i am _meta_end_dot_

 without them i am nothing _meta_end_dot_

 they are not for sale to the highest bidder much less are they to be discarded in the face of adversity _meta_end_dot_

 they are mine and nobody can take them away from me _meta_end_dot_

 i can only lose them by throwing them away myself and were i to do so i would be worth less than the basest cur on the planet _meta_end_dot_

 so endorse your mccain rinos carry him on your shoulders to a landslide defeat that will be remembered for all time but do it without me _meta_end_dot_

 this is my hill this is where i stand _meta_end_dot_

 if you want me off of it you ll have to kill me and carry my lifeless body down _meta_end_dot_

 at least i shall die a free man standing on my feet rather than crawling at the feet of somebody else the anti idiotarian rottweiler last month i asked readers would you could you vote mccain how about now _meta_end_question_

 at the moment i m with rush i can see possibly not supporting a republican nominee michelle malkin an elderly rino who s been in the senate since the beginning of time vs _meta_end_dot_

 a clinton _meta_end_dot_

 we know how that goes _meta_end_dot_

 so what should conservatives do assuming that nothing changes the apparent mccain vs _meta_end_dot_

 clinton match up _meta_end_question_

 i ll vote for ron paul if he runs third party _meta_end_dot_

 otherwise i ll vote for hillary _meta_end_dot_

 better to come back with a conservative candidate in _meta_number_ref_ than get behind another rino _meta_end_dot_

 and better to let hillary take the fall for the coming economic troubles w c _meta_end_dot_

 varones polipundit my position on mr _meta_end_dot_

 mccain is that he would be a poor one term president _meta_end_dot_

 this would be accompanied by congressional losses at the mid term and probably again in _meta_number_ref_ when a democrat would most likely be swept into office _meta_end_dot_

 this unfortunate turn of events would leave the conservative movement in whatever form is still exists in _meta_number_ref_ in a very weak defensive position for the better part of the following generation _meta_end_dot_

 this would be very bad for the country and that s not how i wish to leave it to my children _meta_end_dot_

 i will not vote for mr _meta_end_dot_

 mccain under any circumstances _meta_end_dot_

 i have what i think are valid and levelheaded reasons for taking that position _meta_end_dot_

 please feel free to convince me i m wrong but please stop brushing me aside like a pouty little seven year old ntrepid redstate well if i learned anything tonight i m no longer a gop partisan _meta_end_dot_

 clearly it s no longer a party i can consistently support as i have for twenty years _meta_end_dot_

 i may vote for gop candidates _meta_end_dot_

 romney can still win this thing though it won t be easy _meta_end_dot_

 but as it stands effectively there may be no conservative party in american politics today _meta_end_dot_

 too much of the establishment is backing mccain to say that riehl world view there will be no pale pastels on the democratic ticket this fall and i would not want to go up against them with the sense that we somehow had to trim our sails to elevate our party s most ardent internal critic in order to remain in office but not in power _meta_end_dot_

 at best this is a reprise of how clinton hollowed out the democratic party see how their hearts are with obama and what bush and the republican congress did with respect to spending _meta_end_dot_

 mccain would reclaim the spending mantle but would surrender on all other aspects of domestic policy _meta_end_dot_

 none of this is to diminish john mccain as a true patriot _meta_end_dot_

 no matter who wins we must quickly get behind the winner i ll have more on this tomorrow patrick ruffini
