 steven ala hassan came up with his own bite model i usually do not like to rely on wikipedia due to the reliable information in many articles but this one is pretty good based on real information _meta_end_dot_

 people faint _meta_end_dot_

 they sing out you tell it preacher they yell out amen they weep they cry they look at barack hussein obama as a messiah _meta_end_dot_
