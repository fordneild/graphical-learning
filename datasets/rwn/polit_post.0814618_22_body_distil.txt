  apparently they do not find islamic terrorist videos to be hate speech _meta_end_dot_

 you know video s that call for the destruction of well basically anything not to their liking _meta_end_dot_

 with violence _meta_end_dot_

 they are essentially telling us what they want to and will do _meta_end_dot_

 but hey they apparently have a constitutionalright to do this as opposed to people who call someone a racial epitaph and if the liberals have their way conservatives speaking on the radio among others senator joseph lieberman of connecticut is trying to pressure youtube to pull down videos he does not like and a recent senate report and a bill pending in congress also raise the specter of censorship _meta_end_dot_

 it is important for online speech to be protected against these assaults _meta_end_dot_

 mr _meta_end_dot_

 lieberman recently demanded that youtube take down hundreds of videos produced by islamist terrorist organizations or their supporters _meta_end_dot_

 youtube reviewed the videos to determine whether they violated its guidelines which prohibit hate speech and graphic or gratuitous violence _meta_end_dot_

 it took down _meta_number_ref_ videos but left others up _meta_end_dot_

 mr _meta_end_dot_

 lieberman said that was not enough and demanded that more come down _meta_end_dot_

 the jawa report see when a us company hosts videos or other propaganda created by specially designated terrorist organizations such as hezbollah and al qaeda with the goal of aiding their war against the united states that is unlawful _meta_end_dot_

 while it is fortunate that mr _meta_end_dot_

 lieberman does not have the power to tell youtubethat it must remove videos it is profoundly disturbing that an influential senator would even consider telling a media company to shut down constitutionally protected speech _meta_end_dot_

 the american civil liberties union has warned that the homegrown terrorism bill and related efforts could be a precursor to proposals to censor and regulate speech on the internet terrorism is a real concern _meta_end_dot_

 all americans know that _meta_end_dot_

 they also know that if we give up our fundamental rights the terrorists win _meta_end_dot_

 if people use speech to engage in criminal acts they should be prosecuted _meta_end_dot_

 cutting off free speech is never the right answer _meta_end_dot_

 oh and if terrorism is such a concern to the ny times why is frank rich taking shots at operation iraqi freedom and the people who are and have been fighting in it through the discussion of south pacific crossed at pirate s cove and mccain blogs
