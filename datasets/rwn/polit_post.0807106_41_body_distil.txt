  okay let s see if we can figure out what s wrong with this picture _meta_end_dot_

 first off from the _meta_number_ref_th of this month a leader of mahmoud abbas s us backed fatah party has come out in support of the terrorist war being fought against us and british forces in iraq _meta_end_dot_

 pa text books for school children also push attacks on american and british forces mahmoud ismail a member of the plo executive committee expressed his support for the war on the us during an interview on official palestinian authority pa tv which is under the control of pa chairman mahmoud abbas _meta_end_dot_

 the clip was recorded and translated by palestinian media watch which monitors incitement on pa television _meta_end_dot_

 ismail further defined the us britain alliance fighting in iraq as the arab nation s enemies the imperialists and justified the right to struggle and to resistance euphemism for terror pmw in all possible ways in all the occupied lands those occupied lands he said include palestine and iraq _meta_end_dot_

 now from march _meta_number_ref_th of this month top members of the u s _meta_end_dot_

 house of representatives are trying to stop a transfer of funds to the palestinian authority _meta_end_dot_

 u s _meta_end_dot_

 rep _meta_end_dot_

 nita lowey d n y chairwoman of the house s powerful foreign operations subcommittee wrote tuesday to the u s _meta_end_dot_

 agency for international development which administers assistance to the palestinians asking it to stop the transfer of _meta_dollor_ref_ million to the palestinian authority until it provides certification that the palestinian authority has implemented transparency measures _meta_end_dot_

 president bush last week ordered u s _meta_end_dot_

 secretary of state condoleezza rice to waive congressional restrictions on the _meta_dollor_ref_ million _meta_end_dot_

 congress had approved the money last year but on the condition that rice be able to certify that she had written guarantees from the palestinian authority that a single authority controlled the money _meta_end_dot_

 p a _meta_end_dot_

 prime minister salam fayyad has said that such an authority is in place _meta_end_dot_

 such transfers are otherwise banned under legislation passed in recent years by the u s _meta_end_dot_

 congress because of fears the money could end up in the hands of terrorists _meta_end_dot_

 most of the more than _meta_dollor_ref_ million bush has pledged to the palestinians will be funneled through third parties under strict oversight as congress has mandated _meta_end_dot_

 in the case of the _meta_dollor_ref_ million bush contends that the palestinian authority needs the money to leverage critical loans at a time that it is confronting extremists and negotiating peace with israel _meta_end_dot_

 it s bad enough that we re giving these savages any money at all given that we can be sure that at least some of it will end up being used to fund terrorism against israel but george bush is actually fighting congress to give money to terrorists who are inciting violence against us _meta_end_dot_

 in other words we re in a war against terrorism and we re actually helping to fund the other side _meta_end_dot_

 no wonder people have lost confidence in george bush s ability to fight the war on terrorism _meta_end_dot_
