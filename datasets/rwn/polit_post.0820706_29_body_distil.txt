  senator jim demint is again one of the last defenders of conservatism and common sense in the face of a massive taxpayer bailout of the corrupt democrat enterprises fannie mae and freddie mac for proof of how powerful they remain even in their straitened circumstances look no further than majority leader harry reid s refusal even to allow a vote on an amendment proposed by south carolina republican jim demint to bar the two from lobbying in the future _meta_end_dot_

 senator demint has threatened to filibuster if his amendment isn t aired _meta_end_dot_

 by itself the antilobbying provision won t save the taxpayer from fan and fred but it s a start _meta_end_dot_

 democrats are rushing this bill through because of the favors for fan and fred and new spending for left wing activists like acorn _meta_end_dot_

 but the reluctance of many republicans to look out for taxpayers is harder to comprehend _meta_end_dot_

 they ll get little credit this year for letting the majority democrats say they did something for housing and gop voters will blame them for rescuing the irresponsible _meta_end_dot_

 meantime the white house and treasury are betting that this bill will put a floor under the housing market and buoy bank stocks and thus avoid a deeper financial downturn _meta_end_dot_

 the rescue will only delay a housing market bottom and it may or may not help bank stocks _meta_end_dot_

 the one certainty is that taxpayers are assuming a huge new risk _meta_end_dot_

 click over and read the whole thing _meta_end_dot_

 and then call your senators and tell them to filibuster _meta_end_dot_
