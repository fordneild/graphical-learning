  this is terrible _meta_end_dot_

 a tragedy a martinez woman who used another person s identity to get a _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ breast lift and tummy tuck in greenbrae was sentenced wednesday to nine months in the marin county jail _meta_end_dot_

 she nearly got away with it but a get well bouquet and a navel itch were her undoing _meta_end_dot_

 londie bowman _meta_number_ref_ will surrender at the jail in october said her lawyer deputy public defender eva bennett _meta_end_dot_

 bowman could have been sentenced to as much as four years in prison after pleading guilty last month to three counts of identity theft _meta_end_dot_

 prosecutors dismissed charges of commercial burglary possession of a forged instrument and receiving stolen property _meta_end_dot_

 this is just wrong sending her to jail _meta_end_dot_

 did she really harm anyone _meta_end_question_

 all she wanted was a better life _meta_end_dot_

 and she will be separated from her family _meta_end_dot_

 that is simply just cruel _meta_end_dot_

 where is the sympathy for her plight _meta_end_question_

 i think we should start a petition drive and perhaps have a march _meta_end_dot_

 who is there to protect her rights _meta_end_question_

 dumb argument right _meta_end_question_

 but those are the arguments used by those who support illegal aliens or as they like to call them undocumented immigrants _meta_end_dot_

 people whose first action is to break federal law _meta_end_dot_

 many of them are busted using stolen identities which can do lasting harm to an americans life _meta_end_dot_

 many of them kill rape kidnap rob and do physical harm to americans _meta_end_dot_

 is anyone going to be upset about a woman being separated from her family for starving her horses or for sexually assaulting a child _meta_end_question_

 well a liberal might but then we know their view on crime includes the phrase coddle the criminal when _meta_number_ref_ were detained in laurel miss the usual suspects gave their usual bleeding heart responses _meta_end_dot_

 quite frankly i do no care if illegals are living in a climate of fear _meta_end_dot_

 good _meta_end_dot_

 they should _meta_end_dot_

 they have broken at least one federal law and many of them are break many more laws from minor to major _meta_end_dot_

 i have no sympathy what so ever for an illegal alien who was busted for carjacking and raping a woman in june _meta_end_dot_

 i have no sympathy for illegals who will not be able to rent a place to live _meta_end_dot_

 i have no sympathy for single mothers who are illegal aliens and might be separated from their children _meta_end_dot_

 hint to the illegals you can take the anchor babies with you _meta_end_dot_

 and again i could care less if they live in fear _meta_end_dot_

 if you are breaking the law you should live in fear _meta_end_dot_

 do we need to fix the immigration system _meta_end_question_

 you betcha _meta_end_dot_

 it is broken _meta_end_dot_

 it is too easy for people to come illegally it is too easy for visitors to overstay their visa sometimes for years and decades and it is too difficult and expensive for people to come legally some for a long visit some because they want to be citizens _meta_end_dot_

 coupled with continued increase enforcement and in particular targeting those who hire illegals _meta_end_dot_

 more focus has been placed on the employers and illegals are often leaving because there are no jobs _meta_end_dot_

 illegal alien sympathizes will probably complain about that too _meta_end_dot_

 oh btw don t you just love the naughty librarian sarah palin _meta_end_question_
