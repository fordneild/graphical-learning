 jackson in saturday s boston globe in a piece entitled holding muslims at arms length i m sure it s a hope shared by muslims all around the world but what s derrick jackson s rationale for preferring that obama be muslim over his currently professed faith of christianity _meta_end_question_

 better that than having supercilious staffers whisk women in islamic head scarves out of photo ops _meta_end_dot_

 better that than telling representative keith ellison of minnesota the nation s first muslim congressman not to come help obama in iowa and north carolina _meta_end_dot_

 better that than wooing red states by wobbling before the modern equivalent of the red scare _meta_end_dot_

 in his year and a half long run for president obama has visited churches and synagogues but no mosque _meta_end_dot_

 this has the musty feel of light skinned african americans passing for white paranoid over daylight visits from dark skinned relatives _meta_end_dot_

 obama s campaign has been far more inclusive than john mccain s _meta_end_dot_

 yet as of late obama s handlers are so bent on passing its biracial bi nationally raised man as a pure blooded american a new commercial plays up his values straight from the kansas heartland that they are reinforcing the impurities ignorantly attributed to muslim americans _meta_end_dot_

 it is understandable why barack hussein obama and his handlers suffer from ptsd post traumatic smear disorder _meta_end_dot_

 political woodpeckers hammer falsehoods from the right _meta_end_dot_

 fellow democrat hillary clinton when asked whether obama is a muslim tackily peeped there is nothing to base that on as far as i know despite nearly hitting the third rail over his former christian pastor the rev _meta_end_dot_

 jeremiah wright only _meta_number_ref_ percent of americans think obama is a christian according to a newsweek poll in may _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 but the sympathy may be short lived as obama s fight the smears part of his website has some muslims feeling betrayed by an over the top effort to denounce every obama is a muslim claim as a lie and saying senator obama has never been a muslim was not raised a muslim and is a committed christian how about something like senator obama is a christian who having lived in the world s largest muslim country indonesia having traveled in pakistan and having many muslim friends appreciates american pluralism like no other candidate in us history _meta_end_question_

 ellison this week told the new york times about obama a lot of us are waiting for him to say that there s nothing wrong with being a muslim by the way a lot of muslims are waiting because seven years after the sept _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ terrorist attacks an undercurrent of suspicion remains _meta_end_dot_

 in the _meta_number_ref_ pew survey a third of muslim americans said that within the last year they had either been treated with suspicion called offensive names profiled by police or even attacked _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 obama himself has said christians and people of other faiths lived very comfortably with each other when he lived in indonesia _meta_end_dot_

 it is time for him to live comfortably with muslims in his campaign _meta_end_dot_

 the gist of derrick jackson s wish that obama were muslim comes down to this then if obama were openly muslim he would have more muslims surrounding his campaign and he would lobby for the muslim vote all _meta_percent_ref_ of it _meta_end_dot_

 and more importantly obama could affirm that there s nothing wrong with being a muslim _meta_end_dot_

 and derrick jackson fantasizes christians and muslims could then live peaceably side by side just as they did in indonesia when obama was a small lad _meta_end_dot_

 i don t know if derrick jackson has noticed but indonesia is not exactly a paradise for christians _meta_end_dot_

 just to pick one example let s consider the three christian schoolgirls beheaded in _meta_number_ref_ in the indonesian province of central sulawesi _meta_end_dot_

 an isolated incident _meta_end_question_

 sadly not even remotely indonesia is the world s most populous muslim nation but central sulawesi has a roughly equal number of muslims and christians _meta_end_dot_

 the province was the scene of a bloody religious war in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ that killed around _meta_number_ref_ people from both communities _meta_end_dot_

 at the time beheadings burnings and other atrocities were common _meta_end_dot_

 a government mediated truce succeeded in ending the conflict in early _meta_number_ref_ but there have since been a series of bomb attacks and assassinations of christians _meta_end_dot_

 these included a blast at a market in poso a predominantly christian town that killed _meta_number_ref_ people in may _meta_end_dot_

 christian leaders have repeatedly accused the authorities in jakarta of not doing enough to find the perpetrators and bring them to justice _meta_end_dot_

 the christian muslim conflict in sulawesi was an extension of a wider sectarian war in the nearby maluku archipelago in which up to _meta_number_ref_ perished between _meta_number_ref_ and _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 i could provide you with many other horrific examples of muslim inflicted torture death and misery for christians living in indonesia like these _meta_end_dot_

 unless you ve had your head under a rock you know life is not safe these days for christians in most countries with a muslim majority and in many countries with a muslim minority _meta_end_dot_

 so have indonesian muslims transmogrified into slaughterers of christians since obama was a small lad or were the undercurrents of violence there all along _meta_end_question_

 this much is painfully obvious the supposedly pastoral world where obama lived for four years from age _meta_number_ref_ to _meta_number_ref_ is not a good model for the united states to follow _meta_end_dot_

 trust me things were much more peaceful in the united states of america than in indonesia in the _meta_number_ref_s and _meta_number_ref_s consider for example the _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ to _meta_number_ref_ million chinese slaughtered in indonesia in _meta_number_ref_ and _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 a real paradise on earth _meta_end_exclamation_

 strange but i don t remember any similar mass genocide of christians muslims jews or buddhists in kansas or massachusetts or texas or alaska in _meta_number_ref_ and _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 i guess the definition of living very comfortably with people of other faiths is a a little more lax for indonesia than for america _meta_end_dot_

 derrick jackson ends his piece wishing that obama were a muslim with this little nugget that s an interesting bit of deliberate misdirection _meta_end_dot_

 if islam were really living out peace today if assalamu alaikum was the reality of islam instead of its cover story then nobody would care about obama s religion _meta_end_dot_

 that isn t today s reality _meta_end_dot_

 hundreds of thousands of innocent men women and children of all faiths from islam to christianity to hinduism to buddhism in fact millions over the years and around the world have been slaughtered by muslims in the name of allah _meta_end_dot_

 so when barack hussein obama announces that america is no longer christian even though about _meta_percent_ref_ of americans still identify themselves as christian with only about _meta_percent_ref_ identifying themselves as jewish and _meta_percent_ref_ as muslim forgive me if i question the man s bona fides as a christian _meta_end_dot_

 forgive me if i wonder why the pastor he chooses as his spiritual mentor spouts hatred for america instead of love for all _meta_end_dot_

 forgive me if i take a closer look and ask just how deep are this man s roots in the religion he currently professes _meta_end_dot_

 christianity and islam are not two alternate brands of the same product _meta_end_dot_

 they are not coca cola and pepsi cola _meta_end_dot_

 look at the fruits that each religion is producing today _meta_end_dot_

 one religion has produced the most free prosperous tolerant nation in the history of the earth and i am not referring to indonesia the other religion has produced countless hot spots for bloody religious conflict around the world _meta_end_dot_

 count up the countries where innocent non combatant civilians minding their own business are most likely to be bombed kidnapped beheaded and killed in the name of a deity in the past _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ or _meta_number_ref_ years _meta_end_dot_

 the contrast is clear _meta_end_dot_

 if you are to know a religion by its fruits then one knows enough of islam s fruits as islam is actually understood and practiced in most parts of the world today to know that there is something deeply wrong _meta_end_dot_

 from the running tote at thereligionofpeace com derrick jackson knows not what he wishes for _meta_end_dot_

 we may indeed have a muslim president in america someday possibly sooner than we think _meta_end_dot_

 i for one am not eager to trade the relative peace and freedom of religion that americans enjoy today for indonesia s or chad s version of assalamu alaikum gina cobb
