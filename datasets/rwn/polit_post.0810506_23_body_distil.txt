  i recently finished reading marcy shimoff s happy for no reason _meta_number_ref_ steps to being happy from the inside out _meta_end_dot_

 although it got a little too new agey near the end overall it was a very good book _meta_end_dot_

 here are the best quotes from the book researchers have found that no matter what happens to you in life you tend to return to a fixed range of happiness _meta_end_dot_

 like your weight set point which keeps the scale hovering around the same number your happiness set point will remain the same unless you make a concerted effort to change it p _meta_number_ref_ one begins identifying those factors which lead to happiness and those factors which lead to suffering _meta_end_dot_

 having done this one then sets about gradually eliminating those factors which lead to suffering and cultivating those which lead to happiness _meta_end_dot_

 that is the way the dalai lama p _meta_number_ref_ most of us fall prey to what i call the myth of more the more you have the better you ll feel _meta_end_dot_

 our society s collective trance of wanting more and more stuff or bright shiny objects as my friend stewart calls them is based on a shared insidious and often unconscious belief more toys success and money mean more happiness _meta_end_dot_

 but as these statistics show it just isn t true americans personal income has increased more than two and a half times over the past fifty years but their happiness level has remained the same _meta_end_dot_

 nearly _meta_number_ref_ percent of the people on the forbes list of wealthiest americans are less happy than the average american _meta_end_dot_

 once personal wealth exceeds _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ a year more money produces virtually no increase in happiness p _meta_number_ref_ einstein once said that the most important question a person can ask himself is is this a friendly universe the happiest people answer this question with a resounding yes rather than thinking the universe is out to get them they believe the universe is out to support them _meta_end_dot_

 what s striking is that they don t believe the universe is benevolent only when good things happen to them they take this approach all the time _meta_end_dot_

 when something bad occurs they don t moan and groan why me _meta_end_question_

 it s not fair they see all events in their lives through the lens of ultimately this is happening for my good _meta_end_dot_

 there are no mistakes _meta_end_dot_

 let me look for the blessing in this this belief in a friendly universe is the root of their relaxed and trusting attitude in life p _meta_number_ref_ the sad truth is that as long as you say it s my mother s fault my husband s fault the government s fault my sixth grade piano teacher s fault you won t be happy p _meta_number_ref_ one of my friends often reminds me that rejection is god s protection though i m not always able to recognize this as it s happening when i look at my disappointments of the years past i can see how so many of the things i set my heart on wouldn t have made me happy anyway and often the things i thought were bad ended up being the greatest blessings of my life p _meta_number_ref_ the happiest people recognize that it isn t useful to label events as good or bad in the first place _meta_end_dot_

 instead they choose to trust that everything contains a gift or a lesson though they may not always be able to see it at the moment p _meta_number_ref_ according to scientists we have about _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ thoughts a day _meta_end_dot_

 that s one thought per second during every waking hour _meta_end_dot_

 no wonder we re so tired at the end of the day _meta_end_exclamation_

 and what s even more startling is that of those _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ thoughts _meta_percent_ref_ are the same thoughts you had yesterday and the day before and the day before that _meta_end_dot_

 your mind is like a record player playing the same record over and over again _meta_end_dot_

 still that wouldn t be so bad if it weren t for the next statistic for the average person _meta_percent_ref_ of these habitual thoughts are negative _meta_end_dot_

 that means that every day most people have more than _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ negative thoughts p _meta_number_ref_ thoughts are just packets of energy formed by neurochemical events in your brain which can be measured in terms of electrical impulses and wave frequencies _meta_end_dot_

 your thoughts don t always give you an accurate picture of reality yet your mind goes on broadcasting them anyway _meta_end_dot_

 when you shine a light on your negative thoughts and see that you don t have to believe them it takes away much of their power to create misery p _meta_number_ref_ as the psychologist and brain researcher dr _meta_end_dot_

 rick hanson explained to me during our interview our brains velcro for negativity and teflon for positivity our negative experiences stick to us like velcro while our positive experiences slide right off us like teflon _meta_end_dot_

 in fact researchers have found it takes numerous positive experiences to overcome a single negative one p _meta_number_ref_ from my interviews with happy people i ve found that they don t believe everything they think they are more skeptical of their negative thoughts _meta_end_dot_

 they question the alarms and override them when necessary _meta_end_dot_

 don t fight with their negative thoughts _meta_end_dot_

 they know that these are often just by products of their negativity bias and that they can go beyond the mind and let them go _meta_end_dot_

 register their positive thoughts more deeply and savor their positive experiences p _meta_number_ref_ the real enemy of happiness is the mind s fixations and delusions _meta_end_dot_

 look at the situation differently see the truth and the suffering is less _meta_end_dot_

 if you have the right mind you can overcome anything you can be happy no matter what dalai lama p _meta_number_ref_ we are disturbed not by what happens to us but by our thoughts about what happens epictetus p _meta_number_ref_ all suffering comes from believing our thoughts p _meta_number_ref_ for years a nasty voice in me was always saying you re just not good enough _meta_end_dot_

 if a friend had talked to me in that horrible voice i d have certainly stopped being her friend mariel hemmingway p _meta_number_ref_ one evening a cherokee elder told his grandson about the battle that goes on inside people _meta_end_dot_

 he said my son the battle is between the two wolves that live inside us all _meta_end_dot_

 one is unhappiness _meta_end_dot_

 it is fear worry anger jealousy self pity resentment and inferiority _meta_end_dot_

 the other is happiness _meta_end_dot_

 it is joy love hope serenity kindness generosity truth and compassion the grandson thought about it for a minute and then asked his grandfather which wolf wins the old cherokee simply replied the one you feed p _meta_number_ref_ most people think that feeling hatred anger and resentment toward the person who wronged them is a way to punish them but it s exactly the opposite _meta_end_exclamation_

 holding onto those emotions is like taking poison and expecting it to hurt the other person _meta_end_dot_

 it s you who s hurt p _meta_number_ref_ using a cane i hobbled up the walk to the house where the lama lived _meta_end_dot_

 i told him my tale of woe fully expecting him to turn his compassionate gaze on me and offer his sympathy _meta_end_dot_

 instead he told me brusquely though not unkindly stop feeling sorry for yourself and start focusing on the happiness of others cj scarlett p _meta_number_ref_ i was blown away when i read a december _meta_number_ref_ study in the journal science reporting that the quality of our sleep has a greater influence on our ability to enjoy our day than household income or marital status _meta_end_dot_

 who knew that snoozing trumps salaries and spouses p _meta_number_ref_ grace bill explains is just a fancy word for the infinite unconditional all responsive love of god flowing through our lives he uses the analogy of the unconditional love a mother feels for a newborn child _meta_end_dot_

 the mother sees no flaws in the child only utter perfection and utter deservingness in her love she wants nothing more than to give and give and give _meta_end_dot_

 now move that example up to the infinite level _meta_end_dot_

 god sees the perfection the worthiness the absolute wonder of who we are and in that love wants nothing more than just to give gifts to give blessings to give solutions p _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ happy people feel they are on the planet for some purpose _meta_end_dot_

 in my interviews with happy people i heard the same thing again and again they live inspired moment to moment by a sense of purpose and meaning p _meta_number_ref_ i d heard the quote from cosmetic tycoon mary kay ash pretend that every single person you meet has a sign around his or her neck that reads make me feel important and i put that concept into practice p _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ as albert schweitzer said success is not the key to happiness _meta_end_dot_

 happiness is the key to success _meta_end_dot_

 if you love what you are doing you will be successful p _meta_number_ref_ i don t know what your destiny will be but one thing i do know the only ones among you who will be really happy are those who have sought and found how to serve albert schweitzer p _meta_number_ref_ as a young man of thirty two buckminster fuller had contemplated suicide _meta_end_dot_

 deciding against it at the last moment he d said to himself i may be a throw away person but perhaps i can take this throw away life and devote it to making a difference p _meta_number_ref_ national opinion research center found that people with five or more close friends not including family members are _meta_number_ref_ percent more likely to describe themselves as very happy than those with fewer strong relationships _meta_end_dot_

 another survey of _meta_number_ref_ people showed that those who valued wealth success and status over close friends and a loving relationship with a significant other were twice as likely to be fairly or very unhappy p _meta_number_ref_ the famed nurses health study from harvard medical school found that the more friends a woman has the less likely she is to develop physical problems as she ages and the better chance she has to lead a joyful life _meta_end_dot_

 in fact the results were so significant that the researchers concluded that not having close friends or confidants was as detrimental to a woman s health as smoking cigarettes or being overweight p _meta_number_ref_ you become the average of the five people you associate with the most jim rohn p _meta_number_ref_ psychologist john gottman did a famous study of marital happiness using what he calls the magic ratio to predict whether _meta_number_ref_ newly married couples would remain married or get divorced _meta_end_dot_

 dr _meta_end_dot_

 gottman said that couples who had a ratio of five positive interactions for every one negative interaction would stay together _meta_end_dot_

 in a follow up done ten years later a staggering _meta_number_ref_ percent of the couples he had said would divorce were in fact no longer married p _meta_number_ref_
