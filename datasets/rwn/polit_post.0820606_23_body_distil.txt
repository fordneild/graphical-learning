  yesterday the prince of darkness robert novak clipped a pedestrian while he was toodling around town in his corvette _meta_end_dot_

 that in and of itself would have drawn some attention but what has really got the blogosphere s juices flowing is that novak didn t stop after the accident syndicated columnist robert d _meta_end_dot_

 novak was cited by police after he hit a pedestrian with his black corvette in downtown washington d c on wednesday morning _meta_end_dot_

 a politico reporter saw novak in the front of a police car with a citation in his hand a wjla tv crew and reporter saw novak as well _meta_end_dot_

 the pedestrian a _meta_number_ref_ year old man who was not further identified by authorities was treated at george washington university hospital for minor injuries according to d c _meta_end_dot_

 fire and ems _meta_end_dot_

 novak was later released by police and drove away from the scene _meta_end_dot_

 novak said he was a block away from _meta_number_ref_th and k streets northwest where the accident occurred when a bicyclist stopped him and said he had hit someone _meta_end_dot_

 he said he was cited for failing to yield the right of way _meta_end_dot_

 the bicyclist was david bono a partner at harkins cunningham who was on his usual bike commute to work at _meta_number_ref_ k st _meta_end_dot_

 n w _meta_end_dot_

 when he witnessed the accident _meta_end_dot_

 as he traveled east on k street crossing _meta_number_ref_th bono said a black corvette convertible with top closed plows into the guy _meta_end_dot_

 the guy is sort of splayed into the windshield bono said that the pedestrian who was crossing the street on a walk signal and was in the crosswalk rolled off the windshield and that novak then made a right into the service lane of k street _meta_end_dot_

 this car is speeding away _meta_end_dot_

 what s going through my mind is you just can t hit a pedestrian and drive away bono said _meta_end_dot_

 he said he chased novak half a block down k street finally caught up with him and then put his bike in front of the car to block it and called _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 traffic immediately backed up horns blaring until commuters behind novak backed up so he could pull over _meta_end_dot_

 bono said that throughout novak keeps trying to get away _meta_end_dot_

 he keeps trying to go he said he vaguely recognized the longtime political reporter and columnist as a news personality but could not precisely place him _meta_end_dot_

 finally bono said novak put his head out the window of his car and motioned him over _meta_end_dot_

 bono said he told him that you can t hit a pedestrian and just drive away _meta_end_dot_

 he quoted novak as responding i didn t see him there now i ve interviewed robert novak and even took a picture with him last week end but honestly i don t personally know him and therefore can t say whether he d panic enough to do a hit and run instead of stopping to help _meta_end_dot_

 that being said there are a couple of things worth noting _meta_end_dot_

 first of all some people may find it to be completely implausible that bob novak hit a pedestrian and didn t even realize it _meta_end_dot_

 however i am not one of those people because believe it or not i once actually hit another car and didn t even realize it _meta_end_dot_

 granted it wasn t exactly the same situation _meta_end_dot_

 i was on a three lane road was pulling from the middle lane into the right lane and apparently my back bumper caught the other car s front left bumper in my blind spot _meta_end_dot_

 i didn t see it occur but i did feel a bump and shortly afterwards i pulled off into a service station to see if i ran over something _meta_end_dot_

 when i did a lady drove up and asked me why i didn t stop after i hit the other car _meta_end_dot_

 when she told me that i was shocked and wasn t sure that she was telling me the truth but when the other car pulled in with a heavily damaged bumper i quickly became a believer _meta_end_dot_

 after that we exchanged insurance called the cops and things proceeded normally from there _meta_end_dot_

 so after that experience it seems entirely possible to me that robert novak could have hit someone and not realized it _meta_end_dot_

 but what about the splayed into the windshield comment the witness made _meta_end_question_

 well that does sound bad but the reality is that witnesses make mistakes on things like that all the time _meta_end_dot_

 it doesn t mean that they re dishonest or partisan or anything else it s just that perception is a funny thing when something happens in the blink of an eye in front of you _meta_end_dot_

 it s entirely possible that you can get it wrong _meta_end_dot_

 now maybe the witness didn t get it wrong maybe novak is a jerk who hit someone and tried to drive off _meta_end_dot_

 however i think it s just as likely that novak is a _meta_number_ref_ year old man who got distracted and hit someone without realizing it _meta_end_dot_

 given the limited amount of information we have i don t think there is any way to definitively know what really happened unless some more info becomes available so with that in mind i think robert novak deserves the benefit of the doubt _meta_end_dot_
