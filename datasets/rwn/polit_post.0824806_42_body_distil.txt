  i ve been blogging since _meta_number_ref_ and the reaction to last night s speech was the most positive i have ever seen from righty bloggers in that entire time _meta_end_dot_

 it was a huge speech with a lot on the line and conservative bloggers seemed to believe that palin delivered everything people could have hoped for and much much more _meta_end_dot_

 here s a very representative sample of the opinions i found as i perused the rightroots _meta_end_dot_

 obama joe theisman s leg ace of spades hq sarah palin kicked ss _meta_end_exclamation_

 brilliant _meta_end_exclamation_

 i love her more now if that were possible _meta_end_dot_

 almost enough to do the chris crocker video _meta_end_dot_

 cnn cannot stop saying how good the speech was _meta_end_dot_

 wolf blitzer just asked whether obama made a huge mistake in picking biden _meta_end_dot_

 the liberals on twitter are freaking out _meta_end_dot_

 this is such a proud moment _meta_end_dot_

 i feel so so its just great _meta_end_dot_

 thank you sarah for proving that i was right american princess loving sarah forgive the chris matthews esque title of the post but damn sarah palin was good tonight _meta_end_dot_

 yes i know it s just a speech and she has yet to swim in the shark infested waters of the msm who in case you didn t know it by now already hate her guts but if first impressions are the best ones then sarah palin has done what i thought impossible energize the gop _meta_end_dot_

 to say she was magnificent tonight would be an understatement _meta_end_dot_

 in a way she is very much like barack obama in that she connects with people on a personal level but unlike him she has actually accomplished something in her political career _meta_end_dot_

 you also get the feeling that she really could care less what the media pundits think about her because she is confident in herself and her positions on issues ankle biting pundits she did it _meta_end_exclamation_

 she delivered _meta_end_dot_

 it was a brilliant speech _meta_end_exclamation_

 family comes out what a beautiful family she s holding the baby what a nashuma mccain walks out _meta_end_dot_

 pandemonium _meta_end_exclamation_

 ovation ovation ovation _meta_end_dot_

 mccain dont you think we made the right choice this is unbelievable _meta_end_dot_

 incredible _meta_end_dot_

 crowd is on its feet _meta_end_dot_

 it s a great moment atlas shrugs sarah palin is knocking them dead _meta_end_exclamation_

 it helps of course to be speaking in front of an adoring audience _meta_end_dot_

 but there is a reason that republicans have fallen in love with sarah palin _meta_end_dot_

 her speech was a marvelous blend of using her personal biography to make both her case and the case of john mccain _meta_end_dot_

 she blends in policy with jabs against barack obama _meta_end_dot_

 i think she s doing so well that the media and the democrats will have to redouble their efforts to demean and bring her down _meta_end_dot_

 but she s her own best advocate _meta_end_dot_

 those who know her in alaska have described her as a natural _meta_end_dot_

 they were right _meta_end_dot_

 if a gifted speech launched obama s path to the nomination to be president i think she more than delivered a speech to launch her on the way to the vice presidency _meta_end_dot_

 we ll have to see how she does in interviews and the debate with joe biden but she went a long way towards answering her critics tonight betsy s page wow _meta_end_dot_

 i don t know what else to say _meta_end_dot_

 she did it _meta_end_dot_

 is anyone left with any doubts after this delivery _meta_end_question_

 i would guess not tammy bruce wow wow a thousand times wow what did we see tonight _meta_end_question_

 tonight we either saw a watershed in american politics a tour de force the most striking and graceful debut in our nation s political life and a national introduction that makes barack obama s _meta_number_ref_ convention address look like small potatoes _meta_end_dot_

 or we saw what we wanted to see and the country s persuadable independents saw something else _meta_end_dot_

 i m afraid to believe _meta_end_dot_

 if i m wrong i don t really know what americans want _meta_end_dot_

 i know conservatives are thrilled to pieces and they ought to be _meta_end_dot_

 she knocked it out of the park _meta_end_dot_

 i don t think she could have delivered that speech any better the campaign spot a brilliant speech brilliantly delivered _meta_end_dot_

 so many good lines _meta_end_dot_

 sarah palin shows us all that she is a superb communicator which of course is so essential to a successful politician _meta_end_dot_

 obviously i think of reagan _meta_end_dot_

 personally i loved the difference between a hockey mom and a pit bull lipstick _meta_end_dot_

 with a smile and a great quip she signaled to her opponents that she is tough _meta_end_dot_

 don t tread on me _meta_end_dot_

 i m here now _meta_end_dot_

 i m serious _meta_end_dot_

 i m purposeful _meta_end_dot_

 i have strong convictions and you re not going to intimidate me _meta_end_dot_

 nor will you push this lady around _meta_end_dot_

 a western frontier version of thatcher _meta_end_question_

 gosh does the republican party need her larry kudlow at the corner perhaps the media and democrats would have been better advised to set expectations high for sarah palin s acceptance speech tonight at the republican convention _meta_end_dot_

 after ridiculing her as a small town yokel for the better part of three days palin would have looked good if she managed to avoid drooling during her speech _meta_end_dot_

 in the event though they could have set expectations as high as a barack obama acceptance speech and palin would still have exceeded them in a tremendous debut on the national stage hot air sarah palin is terrific _meta_end_dot_

 the contest has changed _meta_end_dot_

 her character and candor have changed it and john mccain s judgment is vindicated hugh hewitt i m still processing what happened _meta_end_dot_

 i wonder if that s because i was too young to remember what it was like when reagan first came on the scene imao a little slow at the beginning but a very strong speech well delivered _meta_end_dot_

 it s as if she s done this speechmaking thing before _meta_end_dot_

 the crowd is certainly behind her and the fiance is on the stage with the whole family and with john mccain _meta_end_dot_

 it s like they re taunting the press and the democrats to go on with the baby talk _meta_end_dot_

 as i ve said i don t think they believe this hurts them instapundit i just watched the palin rnc convention speech and i am enchanted _meta_end_dot_

 she s serious without being scary _meta_end_dot_

 sarcastic without being nasty _meta_end_dot_

 not to mention her accent charmed my pants right off _meta_end_dot_

 i blurted out loud at one point to rupert oh my god _meta_end_exclamation_

 i m naming all of my children after her which is quite a thing to say for someone who never plans on making any children _meta_end_dot_

 that s how much i like this woman rachel lucas just a terrific speech from sarah palin _meta_end_dot_

 she didn t miss a word _meta_end_dot_

 that must have struck terror into the hearts of obama s handlers little green footballs if any of you in the parking lot caught that home run ball please put it up on ebay so the rest of us can bid on it _meta_end_dot_

 sigh of relief indeed polipundit how did she do _meta_end_question_

 she did fine better than fine _meta_end_dot_

 aspects of the delivery could have been better and the conclusion could have been stronger _meta_end_dot_

 but whatever test you think she was taking she passed it _meta_end_dot_

 the partisans i talked to tonight thought her performance was fabulous _meta_end_dot_

 neutral viewers who tuned in to see whether she seems ready for the vice presidency had to be impressed _meta_end_dot_

 palin showed that she will be effective on the campaign trail and will be a thorn in barack obama s side from now until november _meta_end_dot_

 one more thing since getting home i ve watched a replay of part of palin s speech on television _meta_end_dot_

 she looks very good and on tv the crowd reaction comes through better than i d expected _meta_end_dot_

 sitting where we are at pjtv the noise is a little muted _meta_end_dot_

 on television the crowd s enthusiastic reaction comes through louder and adds to the speech s impact power line wow _meta_end_dot_

 great speech _meta_end_dot_

 not the slick oratory of sen _meta_end_dot_

 obama mind you who no matter your politics is simply a phenomenal speaker _meta_end_dot_

 but gov _meta_end_dot_

 palin absolutely nailed a speech she had to the qando blog home run _meta_end_dot_

 we didn t get a reagan this year _meta_end_dot_

 we got a thatcher _meta_end_dot_

 republican gov _meta_end_dot_

 sarah palin did conservatism proud _meta_end_dot_

 in her acceptance speech tonight she represented not just women not just republicans but small town america _meta_end_dot_

 she connected with an audience in the hall and at home _meta_end_dot_

 she told the difference between a hockey mom and a pitbull _meta_end_dot_

 lipstick _meta_end_dot_

 then she proved it _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 she is the liberal establishment s worst nightmare a lady who thinks for herself _meta_end_dot_

 she touched them all tonight _meta_end_dot_

 she has turned the race upside down don surber sarah palin is about half way through her speech and so far she is killing _meta_end_dot_

 this woman has all her teeth she can speak in complete sentences and she has yet to cry _meta_end_dot_

 those on the left must be so disappointed _meta_end_dot_

 so far my favorite part of the speech though was not anything sarah palin said _meta_end_dot_

 my favorite part was watching her youngest daughter piper lick her hand and smooth her baby brother trig s hair the speech is substantive and articulate but it is also accessible and down to earth _meta_end_dot_

 this is not the lightweight the democrats described to us _meta_end_dot_

 this is not the trailer trash they spoke of this week _meta_end_dot_

 hell she s even wearing shoes _meta_end_exclamation_

 palin is hitting all the points that a republican needs to win _meta_end_dot_

 in short she is laying out a conservative message and that is the only way republicans win the top job lorie byrd at wizbang
