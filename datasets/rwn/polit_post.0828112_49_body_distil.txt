  for years conservatives have been talking about the potential consequences of out of control spending and guess what _meta_end_question_

 the consequences are here _meta_end_dot_

 the markets are plunging we re probably already in a recession and we may be genuinely headed towards a financial crisis of global proportions _meta_end_dot_

 and this crisis _meta_end_question_

 it isn t merely another turn of the wheel in the market another capitalistic cycle _meta_end_dot_

 it s directly related to our national debt and our foreign debtors who are deliberately withholding credit _meta_end_dot_

 are they actually trying to create a crisis or merely protecting their investments _meta_end_question_

 either way nations like china have now confirmed that they have an effective weapon that they can use against the united states economy _meta_end_dot_

 if they cut off our credit they can create a crisis at will _meta_end_dot_

 that s what this deficit spending has done to us _meta_end_dot_

 meanwhile the national debt is at _meta_number_ref_ trillion dollars and headed towards _meta_number_ref_ trillion and that s not even using the sort of accounting standards we force businesses to use which would count social security s unfunded liability of _meta_number_ref_ trillion plus and medicare s unfunded liability of _meta_number_ref_ trillion plus towards the debt _meta_end_dot_

 are those fixable problems _meta_end_question_

 theoretically since we can cut back a bit and hold our spending in place as the economy grows enough to get us out of this mess yes _meta_end_dot_

 but that s only going to work if there is a complete change of attitude in this country _meta_end_dot_

 not only do we need to erase the deficit we need to actually start paying down the debt _meta_end_dot_

 what that means is that we need to freeze spending put together a surplus and use it to retire our debt instead of giving it back as a tax break or using it for new programs _meta_end_dot_

 let me tell you what else it means _meta_end_dot_

 it means the first question that should be asked about every government program is can we afford it it means we need to stop shrugging our shoulders at wasteful programs that only cost a few million dollars it means that we need a freeze on the growth of the federal government not just for a year but for the foreseeable future _meta_end_dot_

 it means we literally can t afford any new social programs including socialized medicine _meta_end_dot_

 it means that both parties for once need to put aside partisanship and actually cut the costs of social security and medicare _meta_end_dot_

 it means that yes we conservatives are going to have to agree to cut military expenses _meta_end_dot_

 we need to spend less on the military less foreign aid to allies and we need to start scaling back what we re doing across the world as soon as feasibly possible with as little disruption as possible to our allies _meta_end_dot_

 what it all comes down to is that voters in this country conservative moderate and yes for the first time ever even liberals should have _meta_number_ref_ words that they keep repeating over and over to politicians we can t afford it it means that politicians should have to justify every new expense really justify it before we spend the money _meta_end_dot_

 it s not enough to nibble around the edges anymore or even merely shoot for erasing the deficit _meta_end_dot_

 what this credit crisis has alerted us to or should have at least is that the problem we are creating now with our spending has the potential to literally destroy the future of this country within the next _meta_number_ref_ years if we don t change course _meta_end_dot_
