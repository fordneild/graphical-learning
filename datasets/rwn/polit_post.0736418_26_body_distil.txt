  s ome of the more interesting things found in qando posts from the left during a review of this year _meta_end_dot_

 first let s do a little comparing and contrasting carl levin in march _meta_number_ref_ whether we like it or not the balkans is an important crossroads _meta_end_dot_

 this is not the time to take risks in undermining those efforts _meta_end_dot_

 those who insist on a debate at this particular moment should think again or they bear the responsibility for the possible consequences of their actions _meta_end_dot_

 democratic senate armed services committee chairman carl levin congressional record march _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ carl levin in feb _meta_number_ref_ i don t want to put a specific number on how many troops we want to withdraw from iraq because that really should be left to the commanders who decide how many would be needed to carry out those limited functions _meta_end_dot_

 but we ve got to the issue we re facing the key issue is do we want american troops in the middle of a civil war _meta_end_dot_

 that s the fundamental issue which we want to debate _meta_end_dot_

 we ve been wanting to debate that for many many weeks but of course we were filibustered before carl levin on meet the press feb _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ steny hoyer in mar of _meta_number_ref_ the bill that is presently before us says that we shall not use elements _meta_end_dot_

 i do know and believe that our enemies will interpret that as a constriction on our maneuverability and ability to act _meta_end_dot_

 that is a dangerous policy _meta_end_dot_

 we should not be engaged in this conflict with that constriction on our troops _meta_end_dot_

 it is dangerous in my opinion for them _meta_end_dot_

 it gives to our enemy a false sense that he may act to the detriment of our people _meta_end_dot_

 we ought to reject this bill as not only premature but as unwise policy _meta_end_dot_

 let us be united with our president and with our fighting men and women in this important endeavor it is absolutely unconscionable and irresponsible to be considering legislation which requires the arbitrary withdrawal of our forces participating in the nato action against serbia as does house concurrent resolution _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 such a course would hand milosevic victory confirm the genocide he has perpetrated against the kosovar albanians and destroy nato america must lead mr _meta_end_dot_

 speaker we must not equivocate _meta_end_dot_

 such a course would encourage the enemies of peace the bullies of the world and would surely endanger our men and women in uniform _meta_end_dot_

 as we enter the _meta_number_ref_st century america stands as the beacon of democracy freedom and human rights _meta_end_dot_

 people around the world look to our country s strength in their struggle for democracy and basic human rights _meta_end_dot_

 we must not mr _meta_end_dot_

 speaker stand now in the shadow of weakness and isolationism steny hoyer in january of _meta_number_ref_ we should begin the phased redeployment of our forces within the next six months jim moran in march of _meta_number_ref_ mr _meta_end_dot_

 speaker i rise in strong opposition to this resolution which would prohibit funding for ground forces unless deployment is specifically authorized _meta_end_dot_

 the only narrow exception provided in this measure is for rescuing us service personnel _meta_end_dot_

 this resolution would undermine our ability to achieve nato objectives in kosovo and more importantly would send the wrong signal to president milosevic about our resolve in the balkans _meta_end_dot_

 i encourage my colleagues to consider the ramifications of this resolution which limits our country s military leaders _meta_end_dot_

 if we are to ensure a stable europe and stop the atrocities then we must destroy milosevic s ability to wage his campaigns of ethnic cleansing _meta_end_dot_

 the resolution in question was one which would have required clinton to go to congress for an authorization to use ground forces if the bombing campaign wasn t successful jim moran in march _meta_number_ref_ at huffpo the stage was set when defense spending chairman jack murtha described his plans to use the president s supplemental iraq spending request for another hundred billion dollars as a vehicle to support our troops in a manner which would limit the president s ability to broaden the war _meta_end_dot_

 one of my favorites hillary clinton on her iraq vote _meta_end_dot_

 here she is in february of _meta_number_ref_ i will let others speak for themselves she said in a telephone interview from washington _meta_end_dot_

 i have taken responsibility for that vote _meta_end_dot_

 it was based on the best assessment that i could make at the time and it was clearly intended to demonstrate support for going to the united nations to put inspectors into iraq _meta_end_dot_

 when i set forth my reasons for giving the president that authority i said that it was not a vote for pre emptive war the former first lady said _meta_end_dot_

 she said the bush administration forced an end to the final round of weapons inspections and invaded prematurely _meta_end_dot_

 the administration is responsible for the status of the war she said and for being grossly misinformed or for having twisted the intelligence to satisfy a pre conceived version of the facts _meta_end_dot_

 either interpretation casts grave doubt on their judgment she said _meta_end_dot_

 hillary clinton on her iraq vote october _meta_number_ref_ mrs _meta_end_dot_

 clinton addresses the senate on the use of force resolution _meta_end_dot_

 the facts that have brought us to this fateful vote are not in doubt she declares citing saddam s record of using chemical weapons the invasion of kuwait and his history of deceiving u n _meta_end_dot_

 weapons inspectors _meta_end_dot_

 as a result president clinton with the british and others ordered an intensive four day air assault operation desert fox on known and suspected weapons of mass destruction sites and other military targets she continues adding that saddam has also given aid comfort and sanctuary to terrorists including al qaeda members while she expresses her preference for working through the u n _meta_end_dot_

 if possible she adds i believe the authority to use force to enforce that mandate is inherent in the original _meta_number_ref_ u n _meta_end_dot_

 resolution as president clinton recognized when he launched operation desert fox in _meta_number_ref_ december _meta_number_ref_ i was one who supported giving president bush the authority if necessary to use force against saddam hussein _meta_end_dot_

 i believe that that was the right vote grossly misinformed _meta_end_question_

 larry king live april _meta_number_ref_ asked whether she thinks she was fooled she replies the consensus was the same from the clinton administration to the bush administration _meta_end_dot_

 it was the same intelligence belief that our allies and friends around the world shared about the weapons of mass destruction october _meta_number_ref_ democratic sen _meta_end_dot_

 hillary clinton of new york said the intelligence from bush _meta_number_ref_ to clinton to bush _meta_number_ref_ was consistent in concluding saddam had chemical and biological weapons and was trying to develop a nuclear capability _meta_end_dot_

 the senator said she did her own due diligence by attending classified briefings on capitol hill and at the white house and pentagon and also by consulting national security officials from the clinton administration whom she trusts _meta_end_dot_

 to a person they all agreed with the consensus of the intelligence that saddam had wmd _meta_end_dot_

 and now some just for fun _meta_end_dot_

 madam speaker nancy pelosi job approval all i can worry about is getting the job done pelosi said _meta_end_dot_

 most of us here are at the mercy of hate radio every day of the week and that takes its toll _meta_end_dot_

 and i can t be concerned about that _meta_end_dot_

 whatever our ratings are my ratings are they re still way ahead of the president well not any more _meta_end_dot_

 republicans they like this war _meta_end_dot_

 they want this war to continue pelosi is all for increasing funding for vets canadian vets and politicizing mother s day women have always been the peacekeepers of our societies _meta_end_dot_

 when i became the first woman speaker of the house this year i was honored to assume this position and humbled by the responsibility it brought _meta_end_dot_

 nothing in my life will ever compare to being a mother not being a member of congress not being speaker of the house _meta_end_dot_

 but i am thankful that i have the opportunity to bring my experience as a mother to this position _meta_end_dot_

 when i traveled to the middle east last month in search for diplomacy and peace i was there as speaker of the house _meta_end_dot_

 but i was also there as a mother carrying julia ward howe s message _meta_end_dot_

 when i cast my vote yesterday for an end to the war in iraq i did so as a member of congress _meta_end_dot_

 but my vote was also taken as a mother of five and grandmother of six _meta_end_dot_

 pelosi is definitely an argument against seniority as the primary requisite for leadership _meta_end_dot_

 john murtha a key lawmaker said tuesday that he expects the u s _meta_end_dot_

 central command to propose in september an immediate _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ troop reduction in the number of u s _meta_end_dot_

 forces in iraq because of growing belief that the so called surge strategy is working _meta_end_dot_

 rep _meta_end_dot_

 john murtha d pa the defense appropriations subcommittee chairman who made the prediction said that does not mean that he believes the situation in iraq is improving but that an increasing number of white house and pentagon officials and republican lawmakers returning from visits to iraq are all talking about success _meta_end_dot_

 harry reid on those troop cuts senate democratic leaders on wednesday rejected the call by the top u s _meta_end_dot_

 general in iraq for a reduction of up to _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ u s _meta_end_dot_

 troops in iraq by next summer saying it does not go far enough _meta_end_dot_

 this is unacceptable to me it s unacceptable to the american people said senate majority leader harry reid _meta_end_dot_

 harry reid on petraeus sen _meta_end_dot_

 harry m _meta_end_dot_

 reid d nev charged that army gen _meta_end_dot_

 david h _meta_end_dot_

 petraeus who took command in iraq four months ago isn t in touch with what s going on in baghdad harry reid on iraq dec _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ the surge hasn t accomplished its goals harry reid said _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 we re involved still in an intractable civil war john kerry speaking of the swift boat veterans for truth _meta_number_ref_ years after the fact we have put together a documented portfolio that frankly puts their lies in such a total light of absurdity and indecency that should they ever rear their ugly heads again we have every single t crossed and i dotted and i welcome that in a sense kerry said after addressing boston s south shore chamber of commerce _meta_end_dot_

 it s a shame we weren t able to produce all that at the time magic hats christmas in cambodia and the like all documented now i assume _meta_end_dot_

 now if they could only find a fiction publisher willing to take the chance _meta_end_dot_

 johnny on the spot as usual _meta_end_dot_

 al sharpton aka mr _meta_end_dot_

 tolerance and harmony talking about gov _meta_end_dot_

 mitt romney s candidacy during a debate with atheist author christopher hitchens in new york as for the one mormon running for office those that really believe in god will defeat him anyway so don t worry about that _meta_end_dot_

 that s a temporary situation joe biden s unifying theory of all bad things since _meta_number_ref_ comment i would argue since _meta_number_ref_ with the gingrich revolution just take a look at iraq venezuela katrina what s gone down at virginia tech darfur imus _meta_end_dot_

 take a look _meta_end_dot_

 this didn t happen accidentally all these things sen _meta_end_dot_

 joe biden blaming republicans for everything during a speech to al sharpton s national action network on thursday _meta_end_dot_

 biden thereby redefines bds _meta_end_dot_

 keith ellison d mn comparing _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ to the burning of the reichstag it s almost like the reichstag fire kind of reminds me of that _meta_end_dot_

 after the reichstag was burned they blamed the communists for it and it put the leader of that country hitler in a position where he could basically have authority to do whatever he wanted _meta_end_dot_

 the fact is that i m not saying sept _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ was a u s plan or anything like that because you know that s how they put you in the nut ball box dismiss you and finally cindy sheehan figuring out why she doesn t want to be a democrat anymore i was a lifelong democrat only because the choices were limited _meta_end_dot_

 the democrats are the party of slavery and were the party that started every war in the _meta_number_ref_th century except the other bush debacle _meta_end_dot_

 the federal reserve permanent federal income taxes not one but two world wars japanese concentration camps and not one but two atom bombs dropped on the innocent citizens of japan all brought to us via the democrats _meta_end_dot_

 have a great _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_
