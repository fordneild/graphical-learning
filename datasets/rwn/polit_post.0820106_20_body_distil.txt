  i caught bob novak s speech at cpac and was wondering if he would do a very similar speech for this event _meta_end_dot_

 as it turns out he didn t _meta_end_dot_

 he also did a great speech and was extremely well received for anyone considering booking him for a speech _meta_end_dot_

 here are a few nuggets he fed to us during his speech and the q a sessions afterwards _meta_end_dot_

 in his opinion _meta_end_dot_

 john mccain s two most likely vp selections are _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ mitt romney he says w _meta_end_dot_

 and karl rove are pushing for him barack obama s two most likely vp selections are _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ va _meta_end_dot_

 gov tim kaine he also said that according to his calculations mccain is only _meta_number_ref_ electoral votes behind obama right now but that the gop could very easily lose _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ seats in the senate _meta_end_dot_
