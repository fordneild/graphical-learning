  john mccain was one of the senate s biggest advocates of comprehensive immigration reform which entails putting illegals on the path to citizenship while simultaneously putting security reforms in place that would be thwarted at the first convenient opportunity by members of congress _meta_end_dot_

 the american people rejected that plan and conservatives were on track to reject john mccain s candidacy when he flip flopped on the issue and started supporting a security first position _meta_end_dot_

 a security first position on illegal immigration entails securing the border and improving enforcement first before illegals are put on the path to citizenship if they re ever put on that path at all _meta_end_dot_

 in john mccain s case he explicitly said that he wanted security first and then he d put illegals on the path to citizenship _meta_end_dot_

 fine _meta_end_dot_

 but then after winning the primaries mccain broke his promise and started advocating comprehensive immigration reform again _meta_end_dot_

 after he was attacked by conservatives who were angry that he had broken such a huge campaign promise he started weaving back and forth _meta_end_dot_

 in one appearance he d promise comprehensive immigration reform _meta_end_dot_

 in another he d promise security first _meta_end_dot_

 well now mccain seems to have settled on a new lie he has started promising both security first and comprehensive immigration reform which is what he did yesterday when he talked to the vile racist group la raza _meta_end_dot_

 this is sort of like promising to be keep people dry and wet at the same time and it makes no sense _meta_end_dot_

 if you re going to deliver real security right off the bat why would you need to deliver security later as part of a comprehensive bill _meta_end_question_

 if you re going to leave key security measures out at the beginning and only deliver them later as part of a comprehensive bill then we re back to square one where you have to believe they ll never really be implemented _meta_end_dot_

 now some people will say that conservatives should turn a blind eye to john mccain s outrageous lies on this subject but that s the wrong approach _meta_end_dot_

 this is a guy who has made the words straight talk central to his campaign and meanwhile he s breaking a pledge as big as george bush s read my lips no new taxes promise before the election _meta_end_dot_

 that s not to say that obama isn t a shameless liar too because he is _meta_end_dot_

 but what should be kept in mind is that if john mccain catches any political hell for being a dishonest man that s a situation he created by being dishonest not a situation created by those of us who are pointing it out _meta_end_dot_
