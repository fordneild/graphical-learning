  within ten years al gore wants america to produce every kilowatt of electricity through wind sun and other earth friendly energy sources he compared his challenge to that of john f _meta_end_dot_

 kennedy s pledge to go to the moon in ten years which made me wonder about the carbon footprint created in the _meta_number_ref_s just to get off the planet the main focus of gore s campaign is of course the reduction of carbon dioxide production _meta_end_dot_

 the answer to that problem lies not in wind and solar but nuclear power _meta_end_dot_

 in america nuclear reactors avoid almost _meta_number_ref_ million metric tons of carbon dioxide per year worldwide nuclear energy avoids on average the emission of more than _meta_number_ref_ billion metric tons of carbon dioxide per year odd that gore didn t mention this _meta_end_dot_

 nuclear generated power creates no carbon dioxide emissions _meta_end_dot_

 the carbon footprint for nuke plants is found in the construction which all power plants even wind and solar create _meta_end_dot_

 according to the department of energy there are _meta_number_ref_ fully licensed nuclear power reactors in the united states though only _meta_number_ref_ are now operational these plants currently provide _meta_percent_ref_ of america s electricity despite decades of anti nuclear propaganda and reams of regulations _meta_end_dot_

 some of these reactors have been operating since _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 tennessee valley authority s watts bar _meta_number_ref_ came online in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 construction of watts bar _meta_number_ref_ started in _meta_number_ref_ and took _meta_number_ref_ years at a cost of over _meta_dollor_ref_ billion _meta_end_dot_

 it was the last nuclear reactor to come online in the united states _meta_end_dot_

 construction of nuclear power plants around the world has not stopped _meta_end_dot_

 with their penchant for looking to foreign countries for examples of what america should be doing it amazes me that the left has failed to see the success of nuclear power in france _meta_end_dot_

 from cbs news nearly _meta_number_ref_ percent of the country s electricity comes from _meta_number_ref_ nuclear power plants crammed into a country the size of texas _meta_end_dot_

 pierre gadonniex the head electricite de france the country s national utility says it all began with a french obsession for energy independence _meta_end_dot_

 in france we have nearly no coal _meta_end_dot_

 we have no oil _meta_end_dot_

 so clearly nuclear appeared to be the best way gadonniex explains _meta_end_dot_

 and _meta_number_ref_ years later it appears to be a very smart decision because nuclear plants emit no greenhouse gases france has the cleanest air in the industrialized world and because the price of oil is now around _meta_dollor_ref_ a barrel it has the lowest electric bills in europe _meta_end_dot_

 in fact france has so much cheap electricity it exports it to its european neighbors _meta_end_dot_

 french nuclear plants supply power to parts of germany italy and help light the city of london _meta_end_dot_

 with the cleanest air in the industrialized world and enough energy to supply power to three other countries france is a shining example of the benefits of nuclear power _meta_end_dot_

 we could have similar benefits here in america but for the environmental movement s use of fear to turn nuclear power into a villainous solution _meta_end_dot_

 the main villain in power production in america however isn t nuclear _meta_end_dot_

 it s coal fired plants _meta_end_dot_

 the green movement would love to see the elimination of these sites which produce _meta_percent_ref_ of america s power _meta_end_dot_

 everywhere a coal fired plant is proposed for construction there is an environmental group there to stand in the way _meta_end_dot_

 but there is good news on this front also _meta_end_dot_

 a research team at the univ _meta_end_dot_

 of wyoming s soft material laboratory has developed a simple low cost adsorption process referred to as carbon filter process which can capture co_meta_number_ref_ and mercury from fluegas generated by coalfired power plants _meta_end_dot_

 co_meta_number_ref_ and other pollutants are retained on a porous carbonaceous sorbent at ambient temperature and pressure _meta_end_dot_

 this is because such co_meta_number_ref_ philic carbonaceous materials are selective to co_meta_number_ref_ with respect to nitrogen especially at lower pressures _meta_end_dot_

 after it has been saturated with co_meta_number_ref_ the sorbent releases co_meta_number_ref_ upon heating to approximately _meta_number_ref_ c e g with steam _meta_end_dot_

 the sorbent is also known to be effective in removing residual mercury from fluegas _meta_end_dot_

 the process for which a patent is pending requires neither expensive materials nor fluegas compression or refrigeration _meta_end_dot_

 hence it can be efficiently integrated with an existing or grassroots power plant _meta_end_dot_

 this carbon filtration process removes an estimated _meta_percent_ref_ of that nasty carbon dioxide from the power plant s emissions _meta_end_dot_

 then as a bonus we can use the trapped co_meta_number_ref_ to get more oil and methane although a typical destination of the captured co_meta_number_ref_ is commonly envisioned to be some form of passive geologic storage or other storage type this work is also motivated by a vision of utilizing the captured co_meta_number_ref_ to displace valuable oil and coal bed methane stranded in mature reservoirs as illustrated in figure _meta_number_ref_ before storing it permanently in spent reservoirs _meta_end_dot_

 such a co_meta_number_ref_ driven displacement is referred to as enhanced oil recovery eor and enhanced coal bed methane recovery ecbmr _meta_end_dot_

 the advantage of co_meta_number_ref_ eor over a conventional water displacement is that generally co_meta_number_ref_ is miscible with oil which leads to a much higher oil recovery _meta_end_dot_

 the conventional coal bed methane recovery calls for the release of massive quantities of environmentally objectionable water to reduce the reservoir pressure that traps methane in coal seams _meta_end_dot_

 a co_meta_number_ref_ ecbmr alternative is attractive because it can produce more methane in an environmentally sensitive manner without much of the groundwater byproduct _meta_end_dot_

 both co_meta_number_ref_ eor and co_meta_number_ref_ ecbmr are examples of producing oil and methane energy that is not only green but also more plentiful and cost effective _meta_end_dot_

 odd that gore didn t mention this either _meta_end_dot_

 what gore has mentioned before is investing in alternative sources of green energy particularly ones he is invested in already _meta_end_dot_

 in fact newsbusters notes that he has started including a sales pitch in his now famous impending doom slideshow this occurred as pictures of such products appeared on the screen with names of the companies involved video available here relevant section begins at minute _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ h t nber sick and tired there are a lot of great investments you can make _meta_end_dot_

 if you are investing in tar sands or shale oil then you have a portfolio that is crammed with sub prime carbon assets _meta_end_dot_

 and it is based on an old model _meta_end_dot_

 junkies find veins in their toes when the ones in their arms and their legs collapse _meta_end_dot_

 developing tar sands and coal shale is the equivalent _meta_end_dot_

 here are just a few of the investments i personally think make sense _meta_end_dot_

 i have a stake in these so i ll have a disclaimer there _meta_end_dot_

 but geo thermal concentrating solar advanced photovoltaics efficiency and conservation _meta_end_dot_

 as gore spoke these words pictures of electric cars windmills and solar panels appeared in multiple slides on the screen with company names at the bottom such as amyris biofuels altra biofuels bloom energy solid oxide fuel cells mascoma cellulosic biofuels greatpoint energy catalytic gasification miasole solar cells ausra utility scale solar panels gem battery operated cars smart electric cars and altarock energy geothermal power _meta_end_dot_

 it s enough to make me wonder if gore is really focused on reducing carbon dioxide or on making a buck _meta_end_dot_

 but then i wonder if this has ever been about lowering carbon dioxide levels _meta_end_dot_
