  one of their favorite retired generals major general john batiste who appeared in an ad for the anti war vote vets website and who had an op ed published on the liberal anti war website think progress in august in which he called for the us to begin a responsible and deliberate redeployment from iraq has apparently changed his tune _meta_end_dot_

 he along with vets for freedom executive director lt _meta_end_dot_

 pete hegseth had an opinion piece published in saturday s washington post h t jim addison in which they together call iraq the central fight in the war on terror discuss what steps they believe need to be taken in order for us to win the war on terror and chastize congress for not being able to move past their partisan differences in order to fund our troops _meta_end_dot_

 the key part of the piece which will cause the nutroots heads to explode second whether or not we like it iraq is central to that fight _meta_end_dot_

 we cannot walk away from our strategic interests in the region _meta_end_dot_

 iraq cannot become a staging ground for islamic extremism or be dominated by other powers in the region such as iran and syria _meta_end_dot_

 a premature or precipitous withdrawal from iraq without the requisite stability and security is likely to cause the violence there which has decreased substantially but is still present to cascade into an even larger humanitarian crisis _meta_end_dot_

 third the counterinsurgency campaign led by gen _meta_end_dot_

 david petraeus is the correct approach in iraq _meta_end_dot_

 it is showing promise of success and if continued will provide the iraqi government the opportunities it desperately needs to stabilize its country _meta_end_dot_

 ultimately however these military gains must be cemented with regional and global diplomacy political reconciliation and economic recovery tools yet sufficiently utilized _meta_end_dot_

 today s tactical gains in iraq while a necessary pre condition for political reconciliation will crumble without a deliberate and comprehensive strategy _meta_end_dot_

 make sure to read the whole thing _meta_end_dot_

 i m sure we ll be hearing soon about how maj _meta_end_dot_

 gen _meta_end_dot_

 batiste never really was a war crtic in the first place _meta_end_dot_

 after all that was the big excuse the far tried to use this past summer when critics of the iraq war started writing about how things were changing for the better in iraq and how the war was is winnable _meta_end_dot_

 stay tuned _meta_end_dot_
