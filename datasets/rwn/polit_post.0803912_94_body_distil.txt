  jay from stop the aclu had an interesting thought the other day that perhaps mccain would select thompson to be his running mate i ask the question because it isn t out of the question _meta_end_dot_

 they are good friends with a history _meta_end_dot_

 it would be a smart move on the maverick s part to stilt up his lacking on conservative credentials _meta_end_dot_

 could thompson serve as the conservative concience _meta_end_question_

 the ideological gravitas _meta_end_question_

 even power behind the throne _meta_end_question_

 how would the conservative base blogosphere react _meta_end_question_

 _meta_end_dot_

 but seriously it is a possibility _meta_end_dot_

 would it alter any factor on you pulling the lever for mccain _meta_end_question_

 to answer that question it would be about the only reason i would vote for mccain this election _meta_end_dot_

 how probable do i think it is that he will select thompson _meta_end_question_

 i think virtually nil _meta_end_dot_

 he and thompson are obviously friends as evidenced by fred s reluctance to go on the offensive against him during the campaign but i don t think thompson would be caught dead on the same ticket as mccain _meta_end_dot_

 that s just my personal impression though _meta_end_dot_

 i just don t see fred settling for being second banana _meta_end_dot_

 besides i honestly think mccain is going to select huckabee _meta_end_dot_

 he did better than fred in the primaries he was is obviously campaigning for the job and he d be a better running mate for mccain they are more ideologically compatible _meta_end_dot_

 if he doesn t select huckabee then the next obvious choice is rudy giuliani doubtful but possible _meta_end_dot_

 mccain might be looking to placate conservatives but i highly doubt that he s going to go so far as to select a running mate like thompson _meta_end_dot_

 brian runs the blog liberty pundit _meta_end_dot_

 drop in and say hi _meta_end_dot_
