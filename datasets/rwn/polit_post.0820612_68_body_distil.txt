  m ccain wants to start the surge too early wesley clark gets his facts wrong and also claims the saudis had a hand in calming the violence the surge has become a bit of a political football in this not yet official presidential contest _meta_end_dot_

 so let s discuss this as rationally as possible _meta_end_dot_

 yes the anbar awakening had some effect on calming the violence in anbar _meta_end_dot_

 that s _meta_number_ref_ of _meta_number_ref_ provinces and it was something which was growing within anbar as we began surging our troops _meta_end_dot_

 but it hadn t grown anywhere else at that time _meta_end_dot_

 read michael yon about that awakening _meta_end_dot_

 i remember talking with him during an interview on wrko s pundit review radio and while he thought at the time that it was a great thing it still was quite small and the violence in iraq still very high _meta_end_dot_

 i remember talking to mg rick lynch commanding general of the _meta_number_ref_rd id not long after the surge s second phase had begun _meta_end_dot_

 the most memorable thing he said was that when he and his troops pushed into an area or neighborhood and contacted the local authorities the first thing they asked without exception is are you going to stay _meta_end_question_

 once answered in the affirmative he said the local intelligence and cooperation multiplied exponentially _meta_end_dot_

 that is how the awakening spread _meta_end_dot_

 a good example of that is baquba the provincial capital of diyala province ne of baghdad _meta_end_dot_

 it was a place almost untouched by us forces and a mixed area of sunni shia and kurds _meta_end_dot_

 the entire town was wired to explode _meta_end_dot_

 yet and this again comes from yon our forces carefully took the town drove out aq and convinced the insurgents the _meta_number_ref_ brigade that it was in their best interest to join the side of the us and iraqi government _meta_end_dot_

 i remember an incident talked about by michael yon where one of the leaders of the _meta_number_ref_s brigades told the us leader there that all they wanted was the us to leave _meta_end_dot_

 the us leader told the insurgent leader that he and his soldiers wanted nothing more than to do exactly that _meta_end_dot_

 yon says it then dawned on the insurgent leader that cooperation was the best way to accomplish that _meta_end_dot_

 also understood by this insurgent leader is we weren t going to go away and try as he might he wasn t going to be able to drive us off _meta_end_dot_

 you don t know how key that is to the success we ve begun to enjoy in iraq _meta_end_dot_

 al sadr somewhere in this time frame also agreed to a stand down of his mahdi army _meta_end_dot_

 some would like to attribute that to graciousness on the part of al sadr _meta_end_dot_

 but as we ve seen subsequently when he did let them loose it was a tactical decision driven by the fact that he wasn t ready and didn t have the assets he needed to directly confront the us _meta_end_dot_

 and he also figured that we might instead withdraw _meta_end_dot_

 he was no more ready for the surge of troops than was aqi _meta_end_dot_

 consequently he played the patriot by withholding his militia officially while the militia s special groups continued to attack us _meta_end_dot_

 would his militia s presence have complicated the surge _meta_end_question_

 of course _meta_end_dot_

 but as we ve seen since it was a very ragtag lot which were pretty easily defeated in both basra and baghdad _meta_end_dot_

 all of this to say the intent of the democrats is to play down the significance of the surge _meta_end_dot_

 they want you to believe that the anbar awakening was well established and spreading like wildfire and that once al sadr stood down his militia that surge in essence was unnecessary _meta_end_dot_

 clark even goes so far as to claim no troops were surged into anbar _meta_end_dot_

 that s flat wrong _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ additional marine battalions were surged into that place because it was still hot _meta_end_dot_

 had the surge not taken place it is entirely possible that the anbar awakening would never have spread outside that province _meta_end_dot_

 that s because baquba was the new capital of aqi and would have remained as such _meta_end_dot_

 given the tactics of aqi there is little doubt a concerted effort would have been made by them to decapitate the awakening leadership in anbar as a lesson _meta_end_dot_

 had the surge not taken place the outlying rings of baghdad would have continued to see car and truck bombs built at will and used in the capital to continue to fan the flames of sectarian violence _meta_end_dot_

 aqi forces would have remained positioned to continue to attack kill destroy and encourage more violence _meta_end_dot_

 had the surge not taken place al sadr would have had no reason to stand down or restrain his militia _meta_end_dot_

 and this talk as i ve heard from obama that the surge was about tactics is a load of dung as well _meta_end_dot_

 the surge was an integral part of a change in strategy _meta_end_dot_

 to ignore the fact that we switched our strategy to counterinsurgency warfare is to demonstrate a complete lack of knowledge about the operation _meta_end_dot_

 when all is said and done yes the awakening was an important development and the stand down of the mahdi army helped delay an inevitable confrontation since resolved btw and made the surge less complicated but the fact remains that the major reason that iraq is in the shape it is today is the surge _meta_end_dot_

 the surge insured and helped spread the anbar awakening _meta_end_dot_

 the fact that we promised to stay made it easy for tribal leaders in other provinces to cooperate with us _meta_end_dot_

 the fact that we surged _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ troops into iraq made it pretty much a no brainer in a tactical sense for al sadr to stand his motley crew down _meta_end_dot_

 and while we re at it it also allowed the time necessary to continue the training of the isf to the point that they were recently able to mount successful major operations in basra and more recently baghdad s sadr city _meta_end_dot_

 so don t let the democrats rewrite history on this one _meta_end_dot_

 they were wrong about opposing it and that is what they re trying so hard to duck _meta_end_dot_

 when all is said and done it was the decision to change strategy and surge troops into iraq to implement that strategy which played the major role in defeating aqi turning the rest of the insurgents into allies and driving the mahdi army off the battlefield at least temporarily and later permanently _meta_end_dot_
