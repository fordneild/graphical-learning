  in recent years liberals have mastered the art of lying _meta_end_dot_

 a lefty blog writes a story then two dozen other blogs pick up _meta_end_dot_

 next thing you know the libs in the mainstream media are echoing the charges that started in the blogosphere without mentioning that they re false _meta_end_dot_

 at that point we re in a catch _meta_number_ref_ because liberals very seldom challenge lies about republicans no matter how obvious they may be and when conservatives point out inaccuracies it s treated as immaterial because we must be biased _meta_end_dot_

 since the mainstream media works this way and is so heavily slanted to the left it makes it very difficult for conservatives to get their side of the story out _meta_end_dot_

 george bush lied about weapons of mass destruction in iraq this is actually one of the most easily disproved myths because after looking at the same intelligence george bush was given many prominent democrats said almost the exact things bush did about iraq s wmds _meta_end_dot_

 in the four years since the inspectors left intelligence reports show that saddam hussein has worked to rebuild his chemical and biological weapons stock his missile delivery capability and his nuclear program _meta_end_dot_

 he has also given aid comfort and sanctuary to terrorists including al qaeda members though there is apparently no evidence of his involvement in the terrible events of september _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 it is clear however that if left unchecked saddam hussein will continue to increase his capacity to wage biological and chemical warfare and will keep trying to develop nuclear weapons _meta_end_dot_

 should he succeed in that endeavor he could alter the political and security landscape of the middle east which as we know all too well affects american security hillary clinton october _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ now here s john edwards saddam hussein s regime represents a grave threat to america and our allies including our vital ally israel _meta_end_dot_

 for more than two decades saddam hussein has sought weapons of mass destruction through every available means _meta_end_dot_

 we know that he has chemical and biological weapons _meta_end_dot_

 he has already used them against his neighbors and his own people and is trying to build more _meta_end_dot_

 we know that he is doing everything he can to build nuclear weapons and we know that each day he gets closer to achieving that goal john edwards oct _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ they weren t tricked by the bush administration and they weren t part of some cover up designed to lie us into war _meta_end_dot_

 to the contrary they looked at our intelligence reports and came to the same conclusions the bush administration did _meta_end_dot_

 that s why both of them voted for the war _meta_end_dot_

 if the democrats were honest they d be willing to admit that bush told the truth _meta_end_dot_

 al gore would have won the election in _meta_number_ref_ if all the votes had been counted the problem with this assertion is that all the votes were counted after the fact by mainstream media organizations that are hostile to the bush administration _meta_end_dot_

 what was their conclusion _meta_end_question_

 that george bush would have won had the unconstitutional full recount been allowed to go forward _meta_end_dot_

 the miami herald did a recount and here s the headline and the first paragraph from their article describing the results review shows ballots say bush republican george w _meta_end_dot_

 bush s victory in florida which gave him the white house almost certainly would have endured even if a recount stopped by the u s _meta_end_dot_

 supreme court had been allowed to go forward there was also a _meta_number_ref_nd recount done by eight media groups _meta_end_dot_

 here s what the new york times one of the participants had to say about it _meta_end_dot_

 again i am quoting the headline and the first paragraph study of disputed florida ballots finds justices did not cast the deciding vote a comprehensive review of the uncounted florida ballots from last year s presidential election reveals that george w _meta_end_dot_

 bush would have won even if the united states supreme court had allowed the statewide manual recount of the votes that the florida supreme court had ordered to go forward so the reality is that even if the unconstitutional recount of the florida ballots had gone forward bush still would have won the election _meta_end_dot_

 george bush s _meta_number_ref_ words in the _meta_number_ref_ state of the union were a lie this was the statement which led to the valerie plame scandal _meta_end_dot_

 it was as follows the british government has learned that saddam hussein recently sought significant quantities of uranium from africa later the white house said this assertion was incorrect and george tenet added that those words shouldn t have been in the speech _meta_end_dot_

 from there that egomaniacal jackass joseph wilson publicly made himself into the main character of a story he was only tangentially involved in and things snowballed from there _meta_end_dot_

 however the british government did believe saddam hussein had sought significant quantities of uranium from africa and moreover a separate report by the us senate intelligence committee said that the us also had similar information from a number of intelligence reports in addition the british butler report concluded that iraq did try to buy uranium in nigeria in _meta_number_ref_ and that george bush s _meta_number_ref_ words were well founded after reading that you can only conclude that the bush administration s mistake was not in lying but in prematurely declaring that the _meta_number_ref_ words weren t correct _meta_end_dot_

 bush made _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ happen on purpose or let it happen on purpose this loony conspiracy theory has been floating around for years despite the fact that the _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ attacks or at least parts of those attacks have been investigated by the _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ commission the cia fbi faa fema the national institute of standards and technology the senate select committee on intelligence the house permanent select committee on intelligence popular mechanics and countless mainstream newspapers among other sources start considering the size of the conspiracy that we re talking about here folks _meta_end_dot_

 not only are we talking about the people who planned and executed the attacks we re talking about the firemen policemen and medical workers who helped out in the aftermath _meta_end_dot_

 at least some of them must have been able to figure out what was going on _meta_end_dot_

 then we re talking about all the people who investigated the attacks who are from every background religious sect walk of life and political party you can imagine _meta_end_dot_

 yet all of these people tens of thousands of them are supposed to be participating in a massive cover up _meta_end_question_

 meanwhile the bush administration can t even seem to keep the details of highly classified intelligence programs from being publicized in the new york times _meta_end_dot_

 it s just not possible that a conspiracy of that magnitude could exist which is why no rational and intelligent person buys into these wacky _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ conspiracy theories _meta_end_dot_

 there is a consensus on man made global warming because the global warming alarmists can t give a good answer to many of the most basic questions that people have they ve simply been claiming that almost every scientist believes they re right _meta_end_dot_

 the idea here is that people will think they may not be able to make a case for what they believe but if all those scientists agree with them they must be spot on however while there is a consensus that the earth warmed a small amount over the last century there is no consensus on whether mankind is responsible whether the warming will continue and whether the consequences will be serious if it does _meta_end_dot_

 in fact more than _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ american scientists have signed a petition stating the following we urge the united states government to reject the global warming agreement that was written in kyoto japan in december _meta_number_ref_ and any other similar proposals _meta_end_dot_

 the proposed limits on greenhouse gases would harm the environment hinder the advance of science and technology and damage the health and welfare of mankind _meta_end_dot_

 there is no convincing scientific evidence that human release of carbon dioxide methane or other greenhouse gasses is causing or will in the foreseeable future cause catastrophic heating of the earth s atmosphere and disruption of the earth s climate _meta_end_dot_

 moreover there is substantial scientific evidence that increases in atmospheric carbon dioxide produce many beneficial effects upon the natural plant and animal environments of the earth maybe you agree with that or maybe you don t but what should be beyond dispute at this point is that there is certainly no scientific consensus on global warming _meta_end_dot_
