  despite the way the mainstream media is talking about obama as if he s absolutely murdering hillary clinton he s actually only up by about _meta_number_ref_ delegates and by around _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ points in the national polls _meta_end_dot_

 hill is also currently ahead in texas and ohio however obama is swamping her in fundraising and if he can use that cash to beat her in texas or ohio after the string of victories he has already reeled off it may be enough to convince her to step aside _meta_end_dot_

 the flip side is that if hillary can win both those states on march _meta_number_ref_ and break obama s streak it could re energize her campaign to have the potential to start a little run for her in the opposite direction _meta_end_dot_

 so that day could be the determining factor whether this is going to be a dogfight that isn t settled until the convention in late august or a relatively early knock out for obama that will allow him to build up a huge fundraising lead over mccain in the next few months _meta_end_dot_

 conservatives are making a mistake if they pick up on the clinton campaign s obama is secretly a muslim meme for two reasons _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ it is obviously not true _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ obama has a real weakness on the religion issue he s a member of an anti white anti israeli church that doesn t belong in the _meta_number_ref_st century _meta_end_dot_

 he can try to pretend to be a post racial president all he likes but when his pastor jeremiah wright talks about what a great man an anti semite like louis farrakhan is and says things like this _meta_end_dot_

 in the _meta_number_ref_st century white america got a wake up call after _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 white america and the western world came to realize that people of color had not gone away faded into the woodwork or just disappeared as the great white west kept on its merry way of ignoring black concerns and obama still embraces the guy it tells you that all of obama s racial reconciliation rhetoric is completely phony _meta_end_dot_

 if it wasn t he wouldn t have such a good relationship with a radical racist like jeremiah wright _meta_end_dot_

 wow this is just a horrible story _meta_end_dot_

 what an awful way to go being killed by the complete and utter incompetence of american airlines desir had complained of not feeling well and being very thirsty on the friday flight from port au prince after she ate a meal according to antonio oliver a cousin who was traveling with her and her brother joel desir _meta_end_dot_

 a flight attendant gave her water he said _meta_end_dot_

 a few minutes later desir said she was having trouble breathing and asked for oxygen but a flight attendant twice refused her request oliver said sunday in a telephone interview _meta_end_dot_

 after the flight attendant refused to administer oxygen to desir she became distressed pleading don t let me die oliver recalled _meta_end_dot_

 other passengers aboard flight _meta_number_ref_ became agitated over the situation he said and the flight attendant apparently after phone consultation with the cockpit tried to administer oxygen from a portable tank and mask but the tank was empty _meta_end_dot_

 two doctors and two nurses were aboard and tried to administer oxygen from a second tank which also was empty oliver said _meta_end_dot_

 desir was put on the floor and a nurse tried cpr to no avail oliver said _meta_end_dot_

 a box possibly a defibrillator also was applied but didn t function effectively he said _meta_end_dot_

 i cannot believe what is happening on the plane he said sobbing _meta_end_dot_

 she cannot get up and nothing on the plane works oliver said he then asked for the plane to land right away so i can get her to a hospital and the pilot agreed to divert to miami _meta_number_ref_ minutes away _meta_end_dot_

 but during that time desir died oliver said _meta_end_dot_

 her last words were i cannot breathe he said _meta_end_dot_

 mike huckabee did saturday night live in what turned out to be their highest rated show in two years _meta_end_dot_
