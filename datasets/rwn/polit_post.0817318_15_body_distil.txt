  some real empowerment for your saturday the training program designed to strengthen iraqi security forces and employ women in the fight against terrorist activity has expanded in al anbar province as several new recruits graduated and became the sisters of ameriyah ferris here on june _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 previous graduates of the sisters of fallujah program work at multiple entry control points into the city to disrupt insurgent efforts to use women to transport contraband into the city of fallujah _meta_end_dot_

 the sisters of amariyah ferris is the first group trained outside of fallujah within the _meta_number_ref_rd battalion _meta_number_ref_th marines area of operations _meta_end_dot_

 the sisters participated in classes held near the towns of ameriyah and ferris _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_rd battalion _meta_number_ref_th marines was augmented by the female search teams of combat logistics battalion _meta_number_ref_ who came out and taught the five day training _meta_end_dot_

 to thoroughly train the new sisters to assist iraqi police the sisters studied topics such as police ethics human rights women s issues working in a terrorist environment female searches and first aid _meta_end_dot_

 the sisters also performed live fire training with ak _meta_number_ref_ rifles and _meta_number_ref_mm pistols as a confidence booster _meta_end_dot_

 the final stage before graduation involved putting their newly learned skills to the test with on the job training at entry control points to ferris town _meta_end_dot_

 in contrast to fallujah which already has female search points this will be a first for ferris meaning the women here are starting from scratch said _meta_number_ref_st lt _meta_end_dot_

 kathryne schilling officer in charge of the training who is overseeing her third class of sisters with _meta_number_ref_rd bn _meta_number_ref_th marines _meta_end_dot_

 the women were taught very basic skills since the idea of women providing security alongside all the male iraqi police is new to ferris _meta_end_dot_

 schilling and the clb _meta_number_ref_ marines also addressed the issue of women protecting themselves while performing a dangerous job such as this _meta_end_dot_

 ferris is a small but dense city that is home to approximately _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ people with only one way in and out _meta_end_dot_

 the marines went over different tactics to deter the unique threats against them in ferris _meta_end_dot_

 one of the new graduates said the iraqi police of ferris town told her about this job opportunity _meta_end_dot_

 she said this is her first job and it is a new challenge that she is happy and brave enough to take on _meta_end_dot_

 i joined to help the iraqi police and to help my family she said _meta_end_dot_

 i m proud to get this job _meta_end_dot_

 i m proud to help the iraqi police _meta_end_dot_

 i m going to make the city safer _meta_end_dot_

 i can prevent illegal passengers in the city _meta_end_dot_

 i m so proud i m so happy shockingly unsurprisingly i didn t see a single mention of this on any of the feminist blogs _meta_end_dot_

 mind blowing i know _meta_end_dot_

 i must have just missed it or something because this is clearly a huge step forward for feminism in the middle east _meta_end_dot_

 and aren t feminists telling us over and over again that they are working for women there too _meta_end_question_

 i guess this flew under their radar as it has nothing to do with sex or abortion _meta_end_dot_

 anyways this story has pretty much made my day _meta_end_dot_

 i love that these women are able to do this and i love even more that they ve volunteered to do it _meta_end_dot_

 it s yet another sign of just how very far we ve come in iraq _meta_end_dot_

 would these women ever have had this opportunity if we had embraced defeat like the democrats wanted us to _meta_end_question_

 the answer is a resounding no _meta_end_dot_
