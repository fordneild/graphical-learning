  i ran across a post over at tech president that said this week we feature a few videos that are either inspired by yes we can or try to convey its positive message in favor of barack obama or hillary clinton _meta_end_dot_

 but we ve come across no voter generated videos in support of john mccain _meta_end_dot_

 is he polarizing the right is there a lack of energy or what _meta_end_question_

 well now there s one voter generated video in support of john mccain _meta_end_dot_
