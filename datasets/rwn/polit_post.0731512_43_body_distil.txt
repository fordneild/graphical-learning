  i ll say up front anyone who doubts all veteran s are heroes need read no further _meta_end_dot_

 but for the vast majority of you who do i d like to take a little different slant in my tribute to veterans on veteran s day than you might see elsewhere _meta_end_dot_

 most of the time when you read tributes to vets they re filled with the stories of those who ve fought and suffered in combat and we see pictures showing the battle weary combat vets which pointedly make the argument about the sacrifices veterans have made and continue to make _meta_end_dot_

 they ve fought in such places as saipan and guadalcanal in the pacific normandy and st _meta_end_dot_

 mere eglise in europe or pork chop hill and the chosin reservoir in korea or the i drang valley hue or the ashau valley in vietnam _meta_end_dot_

 now new names such as fallujah najaf and anbar are added to those which tell the tale of all who have paid the price for our freedom over the centuries and deserve the acclaim we give them _meta_end_dot_

 they ve faced circumstances that we hope our children will never have to face and many have paid the full and ultimate price with their service however not all sacrifices are made on the field of battle _meta_end_dot_

 while infantry armor and artillery are the combat arms the tip of the spear they better than anyone know how important the team that makes up the rest of the spear are to their success on the battlefield _meta_end_dot_

 for instance those f _meta_number_ref_s so vital to a close air support mission don t show up on target at the right time unless that young man flying the boom of a kc_meta_number_ref_ tanker at _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ feet in the pitch black of the early morning doesn t do his job _meta_end_dot_

 that sabot round from an m_meta_number_ref_a_meta_number_ref_ tank fired at a threatening t_meta_number_ref_ isn t there unless the truck driver hauling ammo day in and day out gets that ammo where it needs to be when it needs to be there _meta_end_dot_

 veterans are the guys like the cook who gets up every morning at _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ am and begins to prepare breakfast for his guys and gals _meta_end_dot_

 he s the young nco below decks on an aircraft carrier who makes sure the f a _meta_number_ref_ he s responsible for maintaining is in perfect shape and ready to fly _meta_end_dot_

 she s the nurse who holds a dying soldier s hand as he takes his last breath wipes away the tears straightens her uniform and heads out to do it all over again _meta_end_dot_

 he s the young guy in the fuel soaked coveralls who hasn t slept in _meta_number_ref_ days gassing up yet another bradley from his fuel tanker _meta_end_dot_

 she s the company clerk who makes sure all of the promotion orders are correct and in on time or the instructor in basic training who ensures those he trains get his full attention and who puts his all into helping them learn important lessons that will save their lives _meta_end_dot_

 he s the recruiter who d rather be where the action is but does what is necessary to make sure he gets the best and brightest available for his branch of service _meta_end_dot_

 she s the mp at the gate who shows up every day on time in a perfect uniform and does her job to the best of her ability and never complains _meta_end_dot_

 he s the national guardsman or reservist who gives up weekends with his family to be prepared in case his country calls _meta_end_dot_

 or the coast guardsman patrolling our coasts and waterways in weather conditions we would never venture into _meta_end_dot_

 most vets have never seen combat in the sense we think of it _meta_end_dot_

 but every single solitary one of them has contributed in vital ways to the success of our combat efforts _meta_end_dot_

 without those who support the combat troops success would impossible _meta_end_dot_

 without the wrench turners truck drivers fuel handlers cooks clerks and all those like them the greatest military the world has ever seen is an also ran it doesn t matter what a vet did during his or her service it matters that he or she chose to serve and do whatever vital job they were assigned to the best of their ability _meta_end_dot_

 it isn t about medals it isn t about glory it isn t about what they did _meta_end_dot_

 it is about the fact that when their country called they stood up and answered that call _meta_end_dot_

 they are all every one of them heroes _meta_end_dot_

 to all the military veterans of whatever era out there happy veteran s day and thank you for your service _meta_end_dot_

 for those of you who know a veteran now you know why he or she is someone you should know _meta_end_dot_
