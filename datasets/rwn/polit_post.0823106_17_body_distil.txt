  when jesse jackson groused supposedly off mic that see barack s been um talking down to black people on this faith based _meta_end_dot_

 i want to cut his f cking balls off _meta_end_dot_

 barack he s talking down to black people well yes barack obama talks down to black people _meta_end_dot_

 hells bells he talks down to everyone _meta_end_dot_

 and now barack obama talks down about the only black supreme court justice _meta_end_dot_

 it s not clarence thomas judicial philosophy he disagrees with mr _meta_end_dot_

 obama took a lower road replying first that that s a good one and then adding that i would not have nominated clarence thomas _meta_end_dot_

 i don t think that he i don t think that he was a strong enough jurist or legal thinker at the time for that elevation _meta_end_dot_

 setting aside the fact that i profoundly disagree with his interpretation of a lot of the constitution the democrat added that he also wouldn t have appointed antonin scalia and perhaps not john roberts though he assured the audience that at least they were smart enough for the job _meta_end_dot_

 reaaaaaaly _meta_end_question_

 barack obama has a problem with justice thomas qualifications and intelligence _meta_end_question_

 that s rich _meta_end_dot_

 obama might be smart though he has yet to demonstrate that incisive mind we keep hearing about and he for damn sure lacks qualifications as the wsj editorial easily demonstrates _meta_end_dot_

 what the hell is his deal _meta_end_question_

 women reporters are sweetie _meta_end_dot_

 and the black supreme court justice isn t much of a legal thinker _meta_end_dot_

 oh and then there are the gun clinging mountain nuts that really can t be blamed for their ignorance _meta_end_dot_

 and let s not forget obama s typical white person grandma _meta_end_dot_

 lashawn barber has a must read piece over at pajama s media about how obama injects race into the presidential race at a fundraiser in june obama said this about republicans we know what kind of campaign they re going to run _meta_end_dot_

 they re going to try to make you afraid _meta_end_dot_

 they re going to try to make you afraid of me _meta_end_dot_

 they re going to say you know what _meta_end_question_

 he s young inexperienced and he s got a funny name _meta_end_dot_

 did i mention he s black in both cases obama implied that his white opponents would inject race into the campaign _meta_end_dot_

 after a backlash he tried to backtrack accusing the mccain camp of cynicism instead of racism _meta_end_dot_

 but the intended damage was done _meta_end_dot_

 people of any color have a natural tendency to use whatever advantages they ve got _meta_end_dot_

 there s nothing special about obama _meta_end_dot_

 he understands very well that his ethnicity distinguishes him in this election and he s counting on that distinction to help inspire voters _meta_end_dot_

 it s why he s injected race into the race _meta_end_dot_

 yes obama is more than the color of his skin but even he knows it s an integral part of why some people support him _meta_end_dot_

 the rule seems to be that barack obama doesn t have to abide by the p c _meta_end_dot_

 rules because he s post racial post sexual post modern post provincial post american _meta_end_dot_

 heck like bill clinton obama will be the first woman president breaking barriers for the ladies _meta_end_dot_

 so he can call a woman sweetie _meta_end_dot_

 obama is a racial melange so he can use race _meta_end_dot_

 he can be condescending and diminishing to women blacks whites americans because he s just that much better _meta_end_dot_

 his universality gives him the ability to disparage with impunity _meta_end_dot_

 and if you don t like his policy positions his attitude his lack of experience the problem isn t him _meta_end_dot_

 it s you of course _meta_end_exclamation_

 and by the way if you don t like him you re a racist _meta_end_dot_

 is barack obama racist _meta_end_question_

 sure he is _meta_end_dot_

 he has barely hidden contempt for whites generally and blacks who disagree with him receive scorn too _meta_end_dot_

 is he sexist _meta_end_question_

 well he freely lets fly with demeaning language but i suspect his wife doesn t put up with that crap at home _meta_end_dot_

 obama has been indoctrinated with identity politics _meta_end_dot_

 he sees every issue through the spectrum of skin color or gender or some other fractionated value _meta_end_dot_

 the end result is predictable a racist sexist outlook _meta_end_dot_

 how can it not _meta_end_question_

 people desiring a color blind society don t obsess over skin color they obsess over ideas policy and character _meta_end_dot_

 barack obama is not one of those people _meta_end_dot_

 he knows damn well that race serves him in his desire to become president _meta_end_dot_

 and so he uses race _meta_end_dot_

 in doing so he becomes what he claims to be beyond a racial racist candidate _meta_end_dot_
