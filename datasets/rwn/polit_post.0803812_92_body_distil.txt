  a couple of republican defectors on the stimulus bill all of which are up for re election this year grassley for one _meta_end_dot_

 anyway here s the scoop the fate of _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ rebate checks for more than _meta_number_ref_ million americans is in limbo after senate democrats failed wednesday to add _meta_dollor_ref_ billion in help for the elderly disabled veterans the unemployed and big business to the house passed economic aid package _meta_end_dot_

 republicans banded together to block the _meta_dollor_ref_ billion plan from advancing wednesday leaving democrats with a difficult choice either to quickly accept a house bill they have said is inadequate or risk being blamed for delaying a measure designed as a swift shot in the arm for the lagging economy _meta_end_dot_

 the tally was _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ to end debate on the senate measure just short of the _meta_number_ref_ votes democrats would have needed to scale procedural hurdles and move the bill to a final vote _meta_end_dot_

 now don t get your hopes up that republicans voted for fiscal responsibility because they didn t _meta_end_dot_

 if that were the case this bill wouldn t even be up there _meta_end_dot_

 no they voted against the bill because it added a lot of pork spending that bush promised to veto _meta_end_dot_

 personally i m undecided on whether the entire thing is a good idea _meta_end_dot_

 on the one hand it s going to put money in people s hands who will then go out and spend it which will be good for the economy _meta_end_dot_

 on the other hand they won t spend it on luxury items meaning any non necessary items they ll more than likely use it to pay down some debt or pay some bills which won t do a whole lot for the economy _meta_end_dot_

 plus there s the added debt to the country _meta_end_dot_

 at a time when republicans should really be watching the nation s checkbook the main reason they lost in _meta_number_ref_ they really should be standing firm about adding more red ink to it regardless of what they hope it will accomplish _meta_end_dot_

 in any case michelle points out one important vote that didn t get counted in the senate john mccain s _meta_end_dot_

 the reason _meta_end_question_

 he was just too busy to go in to work that day _meta_end_dot_

 call me a cynic but i don t think he was too busy to make the vote _meta_end_dot_

 in my opinion he knew this was a political bombshell no matter how he voted so he decided to skip it _meta_end_dot_

 think about it _meta_end_dot_

 he s supposedly led the charge against pork spending and this is about as porked up as you get _meta_end_dot_

 if he votes for it then he pisses off the conservative base that he s been trying to woo of late and it exposes him to charges of hypocrisy and rightfully so _meta_end_dot_

 on the other hand if he votes against it to try and appease those same conservatives he hands the eventual democrat nominee an important issue to beat him over the head with all the way until november _meta_end_dot_

 if you doubt that just take a look around the media and see how they are reporting this _meta_end_dot_

 that s the spin you will see on this from now until election day _meta_end_dot_

 no i don t think mccain missed the vote because of meetings or a hectic campaign schedule i think he missed the vote because he had to or it would have damaged his bid for the presidency _meta_end_dot_

 if he showed up in the senate to cast a vote then no matter how he voted romney would beat him with it like a rented mule _meta_end_dot_

 as it is romney will be mentioning how mccain couldn t be bothered to go vote on such an important issue but it won t have as much impact as being able to pin him down on how he voted _meta_end_dot_

 brian runs the blog liberty pundit _meta_end_dot_

 drop in and say hi _meta_end_dot_
