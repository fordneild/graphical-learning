  there certainly will be some racist democrats and independents who won t vote for obama because of his race _meta_end_dot_

 that s an undeniable reality _meta_end_dot_

 there were also christians who wouldn t vote for mitt romney because he is a mormon men who wouldn t vote for hillary because she s a woman blacks who wouldn t vote for hillary because she is white people who won t vote for mccain because they think he s too old etc etc _meta_end_dot_

 will obama s race cost him significantly more votes than mccain s age or hillary s sex would have if she had been the nominee _meta_end_question_

 while that s certainly an open question i haven t seen much evidence that obama s race is an enormous hurdle compared to the baggage that the other candidates brought to the table _meta_end_dot_

 to the contrary i would say that barack obama s race is actually his primary asset not his biggest liability _meta_end_dot_

 obama is arguably the single least qualified serious candidate for the presidency on either the republican or democratic side and he only won the nomination because black democrats voted for him en masse because he s also black _meta_end_dot_

 had barack obama been white not only would he have failed to beat hillary clinton he would have been fighting it out with joe biden and christopher dodd in the _meta_number_ref_th rate also ran category _meta_end_dot_

 moreover look at what barack obama brings to the table he has almost no experience has terrible judgment isn t particularly bright is gaffe prone arrogant he will be one of the least capable least promising least qualified men to become president in american history if he actually wins the election _meta_end_dot_

 so what does he have going for him _meta_end_question_

 the political environment which he didn t create _meta_end_dot_

 he s also good at reading stump speeches which he didn t write _meta_end_dot_

 he s also young which again isn t an accomplishment _meta_end_dot_

 other than that he has the fact that a lot of white americans would love to put a black man in the white house so that they can finally say see _meta_end_question_

 america isn t a racist country because we have a black president in other words barack obama is a mediocrity who has risen this far this fast largely by trading on the color of his skin _meta_end_dot_

 if he were white even in this heavily pro democratic environment he d have little chance of beating john mccain and it s about time more people started pointing out that rather obvious fact _meta_end_dot_
