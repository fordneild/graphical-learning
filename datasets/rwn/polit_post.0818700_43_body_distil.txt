  but it was really james thurber who turned me on to this poem which has been going through my head all day for obvious reasons barbara frietchie by john greenleaf whittier on that pleasant morn of the early fall over the mountains winding down forty flags with their silver stars flapped in the morning wind _meta_end_dot_

 the sun up rose old barbara frietchie then bravest of all in frederick town in her attic window the staff she set up the street came the rebel tread under his slouched hat left and right halt the dust brown ranks stood fast it shivered the window pane and sash quick as it fell from the broken staff she leaned far out on the window sill shoot if you must this old gray head a shade of sadness a blush of shame the nobler nature within him stirred who touches a hair of yon gray head all day long through frederick street all day long that free flag tossed ever its torn folds rose and fell and through the hill gaps sunset light it isn t quite the same without thurber s illustrations which i may try to scan in tonight _meta_end_dot_

 but those lines who touches a hair of yon gray head dies like a dog _meta_end_exclamation_

 march on he said always make me want to cry _meta_end_dot_

 that is there are principles of humanity and decency that go beyond just about any conflict we might have as human beings _meta_end_dot_

 we wanted to know if we could end the evil of slavery in this country and still have a federalist system that included reasonable states rights _meta_end_dot_

 the jury may be out on that but respect for the loyal opposition and deference to one s elders are not a bad place to start in addressing our remaining challenges _meta_end_dot_

 happy independence day everyone _meta_end_dot_
