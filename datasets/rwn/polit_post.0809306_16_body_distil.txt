  i m always reading something or another and right now the book of the week is marci shimoff s happy for no reason _meta_end_dot_

 it s not a book about politics but part of a story she told in there about an iraqi woman named zainab salbi stuck with me _meta_end_dot_

 today because of the violence and chaos in iraq we often hear foolish people say that the iraqis would be better off if saddam were still in charge _meta_end_dot_

 of course it goes without saying that people who believe that have their priorities out of whack and place too small a value on freedom _meta_end_dot_

 that being said it s still worth taking the time to remind people of what life under saddam hussein was really like and why all of us iraqi or american should at least be glad he s gone _meta_end_dot_

 that s what this snippet of a story from salbi does _meta_end_dot_

 life was definitely not normal and at times felt terrifying and perilous _meta_end_dot_

 then overnight it became infinitely more dangerous my father became saddam hussein s private pilot _meta_end_dot_

 when my father was offered the job he couldn t refuse it would have meant prison even execution _meta_end_dot_

 so we tried to avoid the relationship _meta_end_dot_

 but like a poisonous gas saddam leaked his way into my family s home _meta_end_dot_

 he took over our lives as we breathed him in slowly _meta_end_dot_

 everything about us eventually became associated with my father s job _meta_end_dot_

 my family s home was referred to as the pilot s home the street i lived on was referred as the pilot s street and worst of all i was always referred to as the pilot s daughter _meta_end_dot_

 like all iraqi kids i was instructed to call saddam amo arabic for uncle but unlike the other iraqi kids i was often invited with my family to palace parties _meta_end_dot_

 being in saddam s inner circle was fraught with danger _meta_end_dot_

 my mother instructed me never to relax or let down my guard _meta_end_dot_

 many times we d be sitting in his living room having a conversation and he would casually mention killing a member of his family or a friend or colleague _meta_end_dot_

 then he d watch us very carefully _meta_end_dot_

 offending saddam with the wrong remark or facial expression could be fatal so i learned to match my responses to his _meta_end_dot_

 if he was serious i was serious _meta_end_dot_

 if he smiled i d smile _meta_end_dot_

 for years my family and i lived in fear of this man and his craziness _meta_end_dot_

 then when i was almost twenty my mother asked me to accept a marriage proposal from a man i d never met an iraqi expatriate who lived in chicago _meta_end_dot_

 i was horrified _meta_end_dot_

 marrying someone i didn t know and definitely didn t love went against everything my parents had said they wanted for me love passion and the freedom to choose my own life _meta_end_dot_

 at first i refused but my mother cried and pleaded with me so desperately i finally agreed more to make my mother happy than anything else _meta_end_dot_

 what i didn t know then and my mother wouldn t tell me for another ten years was that she was worried that saddam might have begun to have amorous intentions toward me and she was frantic to get me out of iraq and out of his reach
