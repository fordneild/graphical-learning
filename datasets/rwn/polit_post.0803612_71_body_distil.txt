  flip it all around _meta_end_dot_

 say the democrat frontrunner was lieberman just as an example _meta_end_dot_

 say the democrat base was very vocally and enthusiastically asserting that he is too conservative more conservative even than the most conservative republicans _meta_end_dot_

 the democrats are saying that because lieberman is such a conservative which would be very very bad for the country in their view they will instead be voting for the republican nominee _meta_end_dot_

 the two republican candidates in the running happen to be the republican senator with the most conservative record in the senate and another republican senator that democrats have loathed with the fire of hell for _meta_number_ref_ years and who is married to one of the most loathed by the left ex presidents in history _meta_end_dot_

 but the democrats hate lieberman so much that they d still prefer one of those super extra doubleplus bad republicans because their conscience dictates that they do so and it s time to teach the dnc a lesson _meta_end_dot_

 they believe that a conservative president would take the country to hell in a handbasket and if that s going to happen it s better for the democrats if it s under the leadership of a republican conservative because then the nation will blame the republicans not the democrats and next time they ll get smart and elect a real democrat _meta_end_dot_

 i may be wrong but in that scenario i d be willing to bet a lot of money that all of the conservatives who re right now saying this stuff about mccain would be laughing their sses off at the democrats _meta_end_dot_

 they d be rubbing their hands together and cackling in anticipation _meta_end_dot_

 yes _meta_end_exclamation_

 thank you _meta_end_exclamation_

 elect a republican you fools _meta_end_exclamation_

 he ll be able to appoint a couple of mega conservative supreme court justices to lord over you for _meta_number_ref_ or more years _meta_end_exclamation_

 he ll have the majority in congress too thank you very much and will be able to get every bit of horrible conservative legislation passed _meta_end_dot_

 you won t be able to recover from this for a long long time _meta_end_exclamation_

 awesome _meta_end_dot_

 the conservatives would read all the apocalypse scenario stuff on blogs like this one which would be liberal in this bizarro world people practically predicting the end of times if their own democrat nominee were elected and the conservatives would almost die from their smugness and satisfaction _meta_end_dot_

 all the democrats would just have to hope that their plan didn t backfire and the conservatives would do everything they could to make sure it did _meta_end_dot_

 that s what i think _meta_end_dot_

 of course i am not brilliant or the most informed and i could be so very wrong which i genuinely hope is the case _meta_end_dot_

 but i just can t get myself to back you guys up on the whole plan you ve got going _meta_end_dot_

 i think that if mccain loses so many republican votes if he s the nominee it ll be interpreted by the media and the millions of people who don t pay enough attention that the country didn t want another republican president _meta_end_dot_

 i think your plan will result in the appearance of the country giving democrats a mandate and rejecting republicans _meta_end_dot_

 and just as i m not convinced mccain would get into the white house and start bringing hell upon us all as many of you think i m not convinced clinton or obama would either in most voters eyes and that is why i don t think your technique will be effective _meta_end_dot_

 clinton or obama may do things that i personally think would be worse than anything mccain would do but those things probably wouldn t be bad enough for the country to learn their lesson and start voting republican _meta_end_dot_

 remember that most people are not very smart or very informed _meta_end_dot_

 if enough people don t already know what a sh thead hillary clinton is after _meta_number_ref_ years of being in the public eye and therefore elect her president i really don t think they ll figure it out when she s president either rachel lucas
