  so after lunch i head over to catch ace from ace of spades hq getting a blogger of the year award _meta_end_dot_

 ace runs a pretty wild blog uses a lot of profanity and so i m thinking hey here s a great opportunity for a coulter moment _meta_end_dot_

 ace could come out wearing a motorhead ace of spades t shirt spit beer into the crowd drop a few f bombs _meta_end_dot_

 this could be great so when i finally see ace i am completely and utterly shocked because he sort of looks like mark steyn _meta_end_dot_

 but i figure hey maybe the guy is just dressed up for the convention you know like a thug who gets dressed up for court but then ace starts to talk and dude he sounds like a political science professor _meta_end_dot_

 he talks about the differences between european and american political parties and i am wondering if somebody conked ace on the head and replaced him with a local college professor _meta_end_dot_

 he sounded fine just way too smart for a guy who proudly tells the world he runs a mo ron blog _meta_end_dot_
