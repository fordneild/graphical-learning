  this week end i was chatting with a non political friend of mine about sarah palin and she gave me the single most novel take on the vice presidential choices i ve heard so far _meta_end_dot_

 don t get me wrong i don t agree with this it was just so out of the box that i had to blog it _meta_end_dot_

 in my friend s opinion mccain took palin to get the women s vote and much more importantly because having someone who s not ready to be president would make it unlikely that he would be assassinated _meta_end_dot_

 the idea was that if there were people planning to assassinate mccain having palin as veep would make it much less likely that they d go through with it _meta_end_dot_

 on the other hand she said obama made a huge mistake because biden is much more qualified and therefore assassins would be much more inclined to get rid of obama in order to put the much more competent joe biden in the white house _meta_end_dot_

 when i noted that i didn t believe an assassin would think like that and that i d never heard anyone suggest that idea before my friend seemed surprised that it wasn t a commonly discussed theme _meta_end_dot_
