  over the last few weeks people have been focusing heavily on mitt romney and mike huckabee while giving john mccain a pass _meta_end_dot_

 during that time he has managed to get back into contention and now has an excellent chance to capture the nomination _meta_end_dot_

 with that in mind there are three things that people should not forget about john mccain _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ not only was john mccain the driving force in the senate behind the amnesty bill he is one of the two remaining candidates in the race the other being giuliani that still supports amnesty _meta_end_dot_

 what that means is that if john mccain wins the nomination the spin will be without a doubt that conservatives are no longer opposed to amnesty _meta_end_dot_

 would that be true _meta_end_question_

 no _meta_end_dot_

 if mccain wins the nomination his pro amnesty stance will be the biggest hurdle he would have to overcome _meta_end_dot_

 while mccain is making a run at the nomination expect the amnesty talk from his supporters to be kept to a minimum but if he wins expect the same old amnesty and open borders crowd that pushed the immigration monstrosity last year to get cocky and start planning their next big push for _meta_number_ref_ whether mccain wins or not _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ there are generally thought to be three legs of the republican party social conservatives fiscal conservatives and foreign policy conservatives and of course there is a lot of overlap amongst those three groups _meta_end_dot_

 different candidates tend to appeal more to different groups _meta_end_dot_

 for example mike huckabee appeals more to social conservatives rudy giuliani appeals more to the foreign policy conservatives and fred thompson has a message designed to appeal to fiscal conservatives _meta_end_dot_

 however john mccain s support doesn t come primarily from any of these three groups _meta_end_dot_

 although the inside the beltway republican establishment crowd likes mccain his main base of support comes from the mainstream media _meta_end_dot_

 they re the ones endorsing him left and right _meta_end_dot_

 they re the ones talking up his candidacy right now and if he wins they will be the ones that are primarily responsible for it _meta_end_dot_

 the danger in this for republicans is that candidates generally make a great effort to keep their core supporters happy and in john mccain s case his core supporters are msm outlets like the new york times cbs and msnbc _meta_end_dot_

 this leads us to _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ conservatives cannot truly trust john mccain not on fiscal conservatism not on the war on terror not on judges not on anything because the only way he can make the mainstream media happy is by infuriating conservatives _meta_end_dot_

 the bigger the betrayal of conservative principles the more his pals in the msm will laud him as a brave maverick _meta_end_dot_

 he has built his entire career around that one principle and putting a man like that in the white house would be extremely dangerous for conservatives _meta_end_dot_

 if you decide to back mccain and you very well may given how deeply flawed huckabee romney and giuliani are just understand exactly what you are getting _meta_end_dot_
