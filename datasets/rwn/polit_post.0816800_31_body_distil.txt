  d ina cappiello writing for ap has an article out entitled companies get ok to annoy polar bears anyone what companies do you supposed cappiello is writing about _meta_end_question_

 good guess yes oil companies _meta_end_dot_

 the lede less than a month after declaring polar bears a threatened species because of global warming the bush administration is giving oil companies permission to annoy and potentially harm them in the pursuit of oil and natural gas _meta_end_dot_

 the fish and wildlife service issued regulations this week providing legal protection to seven oil companies planning to search for oil and gas in the chukchi sea off the northwestern coast of alaska if small numbers of polar bears or pacific walruses are incidentally harmed by their activities over the next five years _meta_end_dot_

 environmentalists said the new regulations give oil companies a blank check to harass the polar bear _meta_end_dot_

 so if you never read any further you d gather a bush is responsible for giving legal cover to oil companies to harm polar bears b this is new issued regulations this week and c environmentalists are up in arms over yet another environmentally destructive bush policy _meta_end_dot_

 fair summary _meta_end_question_

 so how many polar bears might these new regulations effect _meta_end_question_

 about _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ of the _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ polar bears in the arctic live in and around the chukchi sea where the government in february auctioned off oil leases to conocophillips co shell oil co _meta_end_dot_

 and five other companies for _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ billion _meta_end_dot_

 over objections from environmentalists and members of congress the sale occurred before the bear was classified as threatened in may _meta_end_dot_

 less than _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 and the size of the area to be explored _meta_end_question_

 exploring in the chukchi sea s _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ million acres will require as many as five drill ships one or two icebreakers a barge a tug and two helicopter flights per day according to the government _meta_end_dot_

 oil companies will also be making hundred of miles of ice roads and trails along the coastline _meta_end_dot_

 so we have _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ bears in an area of _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ million acres _meta_end_question_

 a bear every _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ acres _meta_end_question_

 pretty dense bear population wouldn t you say _meta_end_question_

 and a drill ship every _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ acres _meta_end_dot_

 certainly no room for oil exploration _meta_end_dot_

 oh and about those regulations _meta_end_dot_

 how new are they _meta_end_question_

 the oil and gas industry is operating under the kind of rules they have operated under for _meta_number_ref_ years has not been a threat to the species h _meta_end_dot_

 dale hall the fish and wildlife service s director told the associated press on friday _meta_end_dot_

 it was the ice melting and the habitat going away that was a threat to the species over everything else ummm _meta_end_dot_

 not so new then and in fact not even formulated under the bush administration _meta_end_dot_

 and last but certainly not least how many polar bears have the oil companies actually harmed under these regulations _meta_end_question_

 administration and industry officials said oil companies enjoyed similar status in the chukchi sea from _meta_number_ref_ to _meta_number_ref_ and in the beaufort sea since _meta_number_ref_ and there was no effect on polar bear populations _meta_end_dot_

 there is no evidence of a polar bear being killed by oil and gas activities in alaska since _meta_number_ref_ according to the fish and wildlife service _meta_end_dot_

 since _meta_number_ref_ when the hunt for oil and gas began in alaska only two fatalities of polar bears have been linked to oil and gas activities in the state the service said _meta_end_dot_

 of course you had to read to the final two paragraphs to find that out _meta_end_dot_

 thank you ap _meta_end_dot_
