  that s the headline at the washington post today hillary clinton embraces her husband s legacy maybe it s just the word embraces or maybe it s the word legacy but the image that comes to mind is of three people hillary bill and monica _meta_end_dot_

 embracing _meta_end_dot_

 which seems like one person too many _meta_end_dot_

 the only question is which of the three doesn t belong _meta_end_dot_

 i m not sure i can answer that question _meta_end_exclamation_
