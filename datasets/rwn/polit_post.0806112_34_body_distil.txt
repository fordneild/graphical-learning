  steyn writes i heard yesterday from across the atlantic i m traveling in europe that the ontario human rights commission has declined to hear the canadian islamic congress against maclean s on the grounds that they deal in denials of service on the basis of race creed etc and a magazine is not a service _meta_end_dot_

 that s certainly true in maclean s case many of us haven t serviced anyone in years _meta_end_dot_

 three cases were launched against maclean s and me _meta_end_dot_

 one against ezra levant _meta_end_dot_

 the score so far two zip to the freespeechers _meta_end_dot_

 steyn still faces two more cases in other jurisdictions _meta_end_dot_
