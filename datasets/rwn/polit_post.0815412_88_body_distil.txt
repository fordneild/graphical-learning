  there s a very basic question that everyone should be asking about barack obama at this point and it s what makes this guy qualified to be president certainly he would be one of the least experienced presidents that we ve ever had _meta_end_dot_

 he has never served in the military he has never run a business and he hasn t even served a full term in the senate _meta_end_dot_

 moreover this guy is extraordinarily gaffe prone and dare i say it fairly dumb for a politician _meta_end_dot_

 we re talking about a guy who thinks there are _meta_number_ref_ states and doesn t even seem completely familiar with the concept of movie sets _meta_end_dot_

 to get around these glaring flaws obama s argument is that his judgment is so good so fantastic so incredible that we can overlook all of his gaffes his lack of experience and the fact that he doesn t seem extremely bright _meta_end_dot_

 however the fact that he just left his anti white anti american church speaks volumes about his judgment _meta_end_dot_

 now a politician with ambitions that went beyond local politics wouldn t have joined a church like that in the first place if he had great judgment _meta_end_dot_

 however even if he did he would have realized that it could be a problem when he got on the national stage _meta_end_dot_

 so if obama had even halfway decent judgment he would have quit the church when he joined the senate _meta_end_dot_

 then there s obama s run at the presidency _meta_end_dot_

 now he went to that church for _meta_number_ref_ years _meta_end_dot_

 he should have known without a shadow of a doubt that many of the things that were said at that church would be incredibly offensive to many americans _meta_end_dot_

 however probably because obama is so used to being in an environment steeped with anti white and anti american sentiment he apparently didn t even realize that it would be a big problem _meta_end_dot_

 by leaving this late in the game after sticking up for the church for so long obama is making it look as if he s just playing a political game _meta_end_dot_

 oh he loved the anti white anti american side of the church but now that it s getting in the way of his presidential ambitions he s going to kick them under the bus with jeremiah wright and his own grandmother _meta_end_dot_

 for a man who s asking americans to put him in office based on his great judgment he isn t providing much evidence that he actually possesses one _meta_end_dot_
