  dear senator hello _meta_end_question_

 is anyone listening _meta_end_question_

 i know it s been a while since you ve turned an ear to a conservative john but on behalf of those of us on the right i d like to say that we re sick of taking the back seat when it comes to your political agenda _meta_end_dot_

 despite all your talk as of late of being an original reagan conservative and supporter not many of us are fooled when you continue to do things like repudiate conservative radio talk show host bill cunningham for his harmless and reasonable criticism of barack obama and refuse to admit having been wrong on certain issues like immigration global warming and campaign finance _meta_end_dot_

 and while your campaign to win over moderates and independents will probably work as you hope the numbers are showing that you have yet to win the confidence of the conservative voter _meta_end_dot_

 even this week the media has shown evidence that as much as _meta_percent_ref_ of republican voters are dissatisfied with you as their nominee _meta_end_dot_

 that said you may still have one saving grace short of altering your positions to suit the right a conservative vice presidential running mate _meta_end_dot_

 in other words a candidate who is everything that you are not one who can fill in the void where you are lacking _meta_end_dot_

 but don t take it personally _meta_end_dot_

 it s just that we conservatives have become so accustomed to being betrayed by you moderates that we re not sure if and when we can trust you _meta_end_dot_

 if you were to partner with a more dependable republican with a solid record however we might at least be more so inclined _meta_end_dot_

 to help appeal to the base you re going to need a candidate who is a reputed conservative in the areas on which you are moderate to liberal and i realize this may be a tall order _meta_end_dot_

 for one this calls for someone who has proven to be tough on illegal immigration someone who has not recently changed their position and attributed it to accommodating what the american people want someone who didn t claim in _meta_number_ref_ that america needs illegal immigrants to do the jobs that american workers simply won t do a candidate who hasn t sold out to al gore s global warming apocalypse theory would be nice too _meta_end_dot_

 don t get me wrong conservatives are not anti environment we just don t blindly buy in to the idea that humans are causing the destruction of the world buy driving cars instead of scooters _meta_end_dot_

 we d at least like to have some substantial evidence _meta_end_dot_

 you might then like to consider a running mate who did not collaborate with john mccain to say that there is now a broad consensus in this country and indeed in the world that global warming is happening that it is a serious problem and that humans are causing it now i know this is a sore topic for you john but it s one i take very seriously and one i hope other conservatives do as well _meta_end_dot_

 for all your tough talk about the war on terrorism i m not fully convinced that you believe yourself _meta_end_dot_

 when it comes to waterboarding terrorists detaining terror suspects in guantanamo allowing terrorists criminal trials perhaps you might look for a candidate who actually takes a tough stance and recognizes the severity and urgency of the war we are in _meta_end_question_

 if anyone should understand how important this is you should _meta_end_dot_

 and let s not forget about the social issues on which you ve claimed to be so dependable _meta_end_dot_

 if you are truly running a pro life campaign as you say conservatives will be expecting you to select a running mate who not only supports life by opposing abortion but does you one up by opposing embryonic stem cell research and moreover isn t ashamed of his stance _meta_end_dot_

 there is currently much speculation that you may once again turn your back on the right and choose a candidate who is as moderate liberal as yourself if not more think lieberman giuliani bloomberg _meta_end_dot_

 such a move would be a slap in the face to every republican who still has doubts about you and would be detrimental to your campaign _meta_end_dot_

 even i am expecting more from you than that _meta_end_dot_

 perhaps most important in this election is the economy _meta_end_dot_

 you ve already admitted to the public that you don t have much experience in this area and at a time when oil prices are at record highs fears of a recession are rampant and the u s _meta_end_dot_

 market faces growing challenges from abroad any weakness here is going to cost you _meta_end_dot_

 it s likely that the economy will be the deciding factor in _meta_number_ref_ so this should be a no brainer in your decision _meta_end_dot_

 and with regard to taxes i m not even going to mention your flip flopping on bush s tax cuts or how americans will be seeking a leader they can trust not to burn any bigger a hole in their wallets let s keep to someone who will stick to the republican mantra of fiscal conservatism shall we _meta_end_question_

 as it is we re going to need a financial savior _meta_end_dot_

 now john i hate to bring this last issue up i really do _meta_end_dot_

 but your age has been the subject of more scrutiny than possibly even your greatest political weaknesses and some concerns are indeed legitimate _meta_end_dot_

 you may not feel that age will affect your ability to lead your country but it can t hurt to offset the public s concerns a bit by adding a younger and fresher face to your ticket _meta_end_dot_

 this way at least we can try to avoid another year of democrat candidates running on a platform of better hair again it s nothing personal _meta_end_dot_

 finally i wouldn t be myself if i didn t end this letter by making a pitch for my personal top choice for vp _meta_end_dot_

 as a mitt romney girl myself the choice is as clear as it was in the primaries _meta_end_dot_

 like yourself governor romney has already spent the past year proving his worth to the american people unlike yourself he has received the very support from the conservative base that you are trying with such effort now to secure _meta_end_dot_

 i ll spare you my mitt romney talking points but to sum it up mitt fills the above mentioned voids where you are lacking precisely because he is everything you are not and vice versa _meta_end_dot_

 this was made evident in the recent primary race and republican voters are likely to already be aware of how the two of you may complement each other _meta_end_dot_

 i sincerely believe that romney is a trustworthy conservative who can help appease whatever doubts the base may have about you _meta_end_dot_

 on every issue i have mentioned immigration global warming terrorism abortion stem cell research and the economy i have found his positions to be satisfactory at the very least _meta_end_dot_

 meanwhile his famed success with business and his tested experience with the economy are everything you could hope for to compensate for your limitations in this area _meta_end_dot_

 his impressive track record of turning around financial crises is exactly what our country could use right now _meta_end_dot_

 and of course i have to say it bringing mitt s charm looks and comparative youth to your ticket is the closest you can come to knocking off a few of your own years _meta_end_dot_

 if you ask me there isn t another candidate currently out there with equal name recognition and experience who could complement your political persona as well as mitt romney _meta_end_dot_

 even his mild manner and propriety do well to balance your tougher more spirited character _meta_end_dot_

 and unlike your time spent as an elected official his terms were served in the capacity of an executive _meta_end_dot_

 as a conservative voter i m not sure that much more can be asked of a candidate _meta_end_dot_

 so whaddaya say john _meta_end_question_

 will you humor your poor long suffering conservative base a little and take some advice _meta_end_question_

 it s been a long time coming and it s critical if you re going to expect our support this november _meta_end_dot_

 we ve been burned before and may just be too smart to let it happen one more time _meta_end_dot_

 please don t disappoint us i m already getting excited thinking about mccain romney _meta_number_ref_ hats and t shirts _meta_end_dot_

 your wary supporter sharon sharon soon is a blogger at conservatives with attitude _meta_end_exclamation_
