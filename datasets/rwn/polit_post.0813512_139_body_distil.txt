  jim geraghty on the big win for hillary clinton in west virginia _meta_end_dot_

 he makes one valuable point for the democratic echo chamber you ll see the press and obama s surrogates perhaps i repeat myself insist that tonight s result means nothing and indeed in the delegate count the effect is marginal _meta_end_dot_

 but superdelegates ought to be sweating _meta_end_dot_

 white working class voters and various overlapping demographics the elderly catholics jews just aren t warming up to obama and they ve been the backbone for the party for generations _meta_end_dot_

 liberal bloggers and saturday night live and arguably the washington post are responding by suggesting hillary s supporters are racist these people may not be so eager to vote for obama in november as the pundits insist _meta_end_dot_

 once you insult a voter by calling them racist they may not be eager to meekly repent by doing as their moral betters in the pundit class demand _meta_end_dot_

 the shameful way that some in the democratic party are treating their own voters is shocking _meta_end_dot_

 the same sort of political smears usually reserved for republicans are being used against their own _meta_end_dot_

 what will the democratic message for west virginia voters be in the fall _meta_end_question_

 vote for us you racist hick morons _meta_end_question_

 that s hardly a compelling message for the democrats _meta_end_dot_

 the obama coalition of wealthy white urbanites and black voters is not enough to win _meta_end_dot_

 the democrats cannot win when they abandon the working class voters that make up a critical portion of their base _meta_end_dot_

 yet those are exactly the groups that obama can t seem to win _meta_end_dot_

 their are of course good reasons to want to be rid of hillary clinton but her being unelectable is not one of them certainly not as she keeps defying all the political odds _meta_end_dot_

 the democrats have a choice go with their heart or go with their brain _meta_end_dot_

 i shall leave it as an exercise for the reader to determine what course the democrats are taking _meta_end_dot_
