  has the media love affair with obama ended _meta_end_question_

 while they aren t taking the harsh shots at him yet they are quietly starting to take the hmmm we re just wondering type as of late _meta_end_dot_

 case in point sorry long excerpt to start last fall barack obama explained why he hadn t been wearing an american flag pin on his lapel _meta_end_dot_

 i won t wear that pin on my chest the presumptive democratic nominee said _meta_end_dot_

 instead i m going to try to tell the american people what i believe will make this country great and hopefully that will be a testimony to my patriotism what a difference a presidential campaign makes _meta_end_dot_

 obama who suggested back then that the flag pin became a substitute for i think true patriotism after the sept _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ attacks now regularly sports the patriotic symbol at campaign events _meta_end_dot_

 he has given high profile speeches in symbolic locations among them unity new hampshire on democratic togetherness independence missouri on patriotism and philadelphia pennsylvania also known as the city of brotherly love on racial division _meta_end_dot_

 he has peppered many of those speeches with references to symbolic moments from the american past mentioning for example abraham lincoln s house divided address during his formal announcement of his presidential run _meta_end_dot_

 obama gave the speech at the old state capitol in springfield illinois where lincoln gave that very address he even briefly employed a campaign seal that looked a lot like the official presidential seal the symbolism of which was hard to miss _meta_end_dot_

 for a candidate who took an early stance against what he seemed to characterize as an empty symbolic gesture the heavy use of symbolism in obama s campaign has been particularly hard to ignore _meta_end_dot_

 but wait if you order in the next _meta_number_ref_ minutes there s more _meta_end_exclamation_

 greenberg argues that obama tends to emphasize the symbolic over policy detail in his campaign a tendency reflected by his reliance especially early on on vague notions of hope and change bill clinton used a lot of symbolism too but he also ran with policy as his centerpiece said greenberg _meta_end_dot_

 former clinton advisor george stephanopoulos argued that specificity was the character issue and they made that a focus _meta_end_dot_

 that s not really what obama is doing _meta_end_dot_

 it doesn t mean he hasn t thought about policy but he isn t making it the central focus of his campaign can you imagine this showing up in a major credentialed media outlet just a month ago _meta_end_question_

 symbolism is great when it has something concrete to back it up _meta_end_dot_
