  na na na na na na na na hey hey hey get out of the republican party you nazi loving freak _meta_end_exclamation_

 if fans of hitler held a party and a candidate for federal office attended would anybody notice _meta_end_question_

 apparently yes _meta_end_dot_

 u s _meta_end_dot_

 congressional candidate tony zirkle is facing criticism from one of his primary opponents and a host of people on the internet for speaking at an event over the weekend that celebrated adolf hitler s birthday _meta_end_dot_

 zirkle confirmed to the news dispatch on monday he spoke sunday in chicago at a meeting of the nationalist socialist workers party whose symbol is a swastika _meta_end_dot_

 when asked if he was a nazi or sympathized with nazis or white supremacists zirkle replied he didn t know enough about the group to either favor it or oppose it _meta_end_dot_

 this is just a great opportunity for me to witness he said referring to his message and his christian belief _meta_end_dot_

 he also told wims radio in michigan city that he didn t believe the event he attended included people necessarily of the nazi mindset pointing out the name isn t nazi but nationalist socialist workers party _meta_end_dot_

 the crown point republican spoke in front of about _meta_number_ref_ white activists at an event honoring the birth of hitler _meta_end_dot_

 the german leader was responsible for the genocide of millions of jews and others during world war ii _meta_end_dot_

 zirkle said the group asked him to speak to discuss the effect of pornography and prostitution on young white women and girls _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 at the event hitler s birthday was observed with a cake with a photo of hitler and the words seig heil the guy showed up at a nazi meeting on hitler s birthday to discuss the effect of pornography and prostitution on young white women and girls with a bunch of people who had swastikas on their arms and his excuse is are you ready i told channel _meta_number_ref_ wndu in south bend in the beginning that i d speak to any group that wanted me to speak zirkle said monday _meta_end_dot_

 he said he s also recently spoken on the subject to a pair of black journalists _meta_end_dot_

 i m keeping my promise _meta_end_dot_

 i ll speak to any group that is not how they do excuses in the big leagues my friend _meta_end_dot_

 maybe this guy should have learned from the best pol in the business at disassociating himself from the loons he s associated with _meta_end_dot_

 for example the statements that these nazis made that are the cause of this controversy were not statements i personally heard them preach while i sat in the pews or heard them utter in private conversation these nazis are like old uncles who say things i don t always agree with i would say that this has been a distraction from the core message of our campaign if anything these nazis are trying to make america a better america _meta_end_dot_

 if anything these nazis are true patriots tony zirkle strongly condemns the violent actions of the nazis as he does all acts of violence _meta_end_dot_

 but he was a young child when the nazis were active in germany and any attempt to connect zirkle with events of world war _meta_number_ref_ is ridiculous hey it worked for obama right _meta_end_question_

 ps buh bye zirkle _meta_end_dot_

 your career is over _meta_end_dot_
