  if you had to guess that a bill the democrats were going to introduce on crime and punishment would be more pro victim or pro criminal which would you choose _meta_end_question_

 insert jeopardy music here yep you guessed it _meta_end_dot_

 pro criminal is the correct answer _meta_end_dot_

 the democrats who feature killing the unborn child as one of their major platform planks seem to go out of their way to protect the convicted murderer _meta_end_dot_

 in our lovely state of new jersey _meta_number_ref_ democrats released a press release touting their proposal to make new jersey the first state to legislatively abolish the death penalty citing the cost and cruelty of it as opposed to the murdered victims who are dead and buried trenton calling it cruel and costly assembly speaker joseph j _meta_end_dot_

 roberts jr and assembly speaker pro tempore wilfredo caraballo today announced that they will seek to make new jersey the first state in the country to legislatively abolish capital punishment _meta_end_dot_

 teaming with dead man walking author sister helen prejean and other death penalty opponents at a state house press conference roberts said a bipartisan repeal bill sponsored by caraballo d essex would go before the assembly judiciary committee on december _meta_number_ref_ so that it could be positioned for an assembly floor vote on december _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 the new jersey death penalty has become a paper deterrent the epitome of false security said roberts d camden _meta_end_dot_

 they also cite that for the _meta_number_ref_ years the bill has been in the books not one person has been executed yet but they fail to mention that the reason is because of liberal judges and liberal elected officials who prolong the process _meta_end_dot_

 let s not abolish the death penalty let s get remove liberals from office _meta_end_dot_

 the proposal also claims to remove the death penalty and in it s place mandate life in prison without parole however my sparring partner eric sedler at redjersey points out what democrats mean by life in prison without parole in the press release roberts had some pretty harsh words for murderers and the death penalty the law has become an absolute exercise in futility said roberts _meta_end_dot_

 it is time to end it later he says the bottom line of that bill is to lock murderers in jail and throw away the key said roberts _meta_end_dot_

 anyone who takes another person s life should rot in jail the bill that assemblyman roberts is referring to is a_meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 the bill reads repeals the death penalty and replaces it with life imprisonment without eligibility for parole in certain circumstances _meta_end_dot_

 this will be the fourth time i have pointed out that upon a read of the bill s statement the only circumstances that allow for life imprisonment without eligibility for parole are _meta_number_ref_ if the victim was a law enforcement officer and was murdered while performing his official duties or was murdered because of his status as a law enforcement officer _meta_number_ref_ if the murder victim is less than _meta_number_ref_ years old and the act is committed in the course of the commission whether alone or with one or more persons of a violation of n j s _meta_number_ref_c _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ sexual assault or n j s _meta_number_ref_c _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ criminal sexual contact and _meta_number_ref_ if certain aggravators exist _meta_end_dot_

 but wait i though speaker roberts said the bottom line of that bill is to lock murderers in jail and throw away the key perhaps he forgot to say the bottom line of that bill is to lock murderers in jail and throw away the key for _meta_number_ref_ years because life in prison really means _meta_number_ref_ years and the only exceptions according to this bill are the ones i just cited _meta_end_dot_

 speaker roberts goes on to cite the conclusion of the death penalty commission which according to the press release recommended replacing the death penalty with life in jail without possibility of parole a_meta_number_ref_ does not do this at all it only replaces the death penalty with life in jail without possibility of parole in the circumstances i cited above _meta_end_dot_

 i guess it depends on what the definition of life in prison is _meta_end_exclamation_
