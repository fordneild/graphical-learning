  i still want to see obama run for the nomination though and not just because he won t win the general _meta_end_dot_

 the democrats always act as if disagreeing with a black man is caused by some sort of racist impulse _meta_end_dot_

 that s why for the most part they ignored anti semitic crank al sharpton during the last democratic presidential primary _meta_end_dot_

 however obama would be too much of a rock stah to ignore so they d have to beat him up and all the charges and counter charges of racism among democrats would be just too delicious to miss john hawkins dec _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ a series of comments from sen _meta_end_dot_

 hillary rodham clinton her husband and her supporters are spurring a racial backlash and adding a divisive edge to the presidential primary as the candidates head south to heavily african american south carolina _meta_end_dot_

 the comments which ranged from the new york senator appearing to diminish the role of martin luther king jr _meta_end_dot_

 in the civil rights movement an aide later said she misspoke to bill clinton dismissing sen _meta_end_dot_

 barack obama s image in the media as a fairy tale generated outrage on black radio black blogs and cable television _meta_end_dot_

 and now they ve drawn the attention of prominent african american politicians _meta_end_dot_

 but other black clinton supporters found themselves wincing at the clintons words if not questioning their intent _meta_end_dot_

 a harlem based consultant to the clinton campaign bill lynch called the former president s comments a mistake and said his own phone had been ringing with friends around the country voicing their concern _meta_end_dot_

 i ve been concerned about some of those comments and that there might be a backlash he said _meta_end_dot_

 illinois state senate president emil jones a prominent obama supporter echoed those sentiments _meta_end_dot_

 it s very unfortunate that the president would make a statement like that he said of bill clinton s criticism of obama s experience adding that the african american community had saved his presidency after the monica lewinsky scandal _meta_end_dot_

 they owe the african american community not the reverse he said _meta_end_dot_

 maybe hillary and bill should get behind sen _meta_end_dot_

 barack obama rep _meta_end_dot_

 jesse jackson jr through a spokesman used even stronger language _meta_end_dot_

 following barack obama s victory in iowa and historic voter turnout in new hampshire the cynics unfortunately have stepped up their efforts to decry his uplifting message of hope and fundamental change _meta_end_dot_

 regrettably they have resorted to distasteful and condescending language that appeals to our fears rather than our hopes _meta_end_dot_

 i sincerely hope that they ll turn away from such reactionary disparaging rhetoric the politico on jan _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ the democratic party loves nothing better than to play the identity politics card and pit groups of americans against each other _meta_end_dot_

 meanwhile they treat black americans like second class citizens _meta_end_dot_

 yes they ll take their votes and give them a little lip service but white liberals think black americans aren t competent enough to get by without their help _meta_end_dot_

 that s what their support of affirmative action and racial set asides are really all about _meta_end_dot_

 now you get to see both those factors in action _meta_end_dot_

 you have black democrats who are hypersensitive about race related issues seeing a black candidate being denied the presidency by democrats because of his race and let s face it obama may win the nomination because he s clearly the better candidate and because the mainstream media seems to be lining up behind him but if he doesn t get the nomination it ll be because he s black _meta_end_dot_

 seriously for all the talk of experience vs _meta_end_dot_

 change neither barack nor hillary is experienced but hillary is much more of a washington insider than obama _meta_end_dot_

 plus barack is charismatic and likable while hillary isn t _meta_end_dot_

 barack has enormous grassroots support while hillary doesn t _meta_end_dot_

 barack polls better against the gop than hillary _meta_end_dot_

 barack is better liked by independents than hillary _meta_end_dot_

 barack has much less baggage _meta_end_dot_

 he has less corruption problems and they both have pretty much the same views on the issues _meta_end_dot_

 but hillary s white barack s black and a lot of democrats aren t going to vote for a black man and the clintons understand that _meta_end_dot_

 whom do you think they re trying to reach out to with their comments about spadework shuck and jive and the suggestions that obama is a drug dealer _meta_end_question_

 they re sending a little message out there to white democrats that says do you really trust someone who s not white to be president of the united states it s not pretty but hillary will do anything it takes to capture the presidency and obama has shaken her enough that she s willing to stoop to that level _meta_end_dot_

 all i can say is that i hope this opens some eyes to the democratic party s incredibly exploitive attitude towards black americans _meta_end_dot_

 ps here s an alternate theory on why the clinton campaign is making subtle racially charged attacks on obama although this may credit them with being more clever than they are obama doesn t nurse racial grievances he s not a race hustler and he has taken a lot of care during the campaign not to play the race card _meta_end_dot_

 this is one of the reasons that he s well liked by a lot of moderate and independent white voters who retch at the very mention of parasites like jesse jackson and al sharpton _meta_end_dot_

 so what the clintons may be doing is getting obama s supporters to tarnish him by proxy on this issue _meta_end_dot_

 even if obama doesn t do it personally if there s a tsunami of people around him playing the race card even if there s some validity to it a lot of white voters who are warm to obama may assume that he s another jesse jackson after all _meta_end_dot_

 ps _meta_number_ref_ whether my alternate theory is right or not obama should be very careful _meta_end_dot_

 a significant part of his appeal is based on being a different kind of politician and if voters ever decide he s offering more of the same old same old on race as other democratic politicians it will reduce his appeal significantly _meta_end_dot_
