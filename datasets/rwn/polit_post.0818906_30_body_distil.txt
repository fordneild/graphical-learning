  predicting whom a particular candidate will take as vice president is always difficult because so many factors play into it _meta_end_dot_

 do both candidates get along _meta_end_question_

 is the presidential nominee looking to carry a particular state region or demographic group is he looking to solidify his base or is he just trying to add strength across the board in a general election _meta_end_question_

 obama also has some unique needs _meta_end_dot_

 he has very little relevant experience difficulty connecting with the older and middle class white voters he ll need to win and potential difficulties caused by a nasty primary fight with hillary clinton _meta_end_dot_

 put it all together and there s no way to know which way obama will ultimately go _meta_end_dot_

 still here are some of the most likely and or discussed possibilities _meta_end_dot_

 evan bayh bayh is an experienced former governor of indiana and has been a senator since _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 he has a reputation for being a moderate being fiscally conservative and he would likely be able to turn indiana _meta_number_ref_ electoral votes blue _meta_end_dot_

 bayh wouldn t be one of the more exciting choices but despite his lack of charisma he would certainly be one of the stronger picks that obama could make _meta_end_dot_

 joe biden biden is very experienced is the chairman of the u s _meta_end_dot_

 senate committee on foreign relations and has a certain sort of charm _meta_end_dot_

 he s also gaffe prone including this humdinger about obama from the democratic primaries i mean you got the first mainstream african american who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy i mean that s a storybook man yeah probably not _meta_end_dot_

 michael bloomberg the ex republican independent jewish mayor of new york is a down the line liberal on almost every issue but his biggest asset would be deep pockets that he could use to finance the campaign _meta_end_dot_

 given that obama should have a much bigger warchest than mccain bloomberg probably couldn t add much to the campaign _meta_end_dot_

 phil bredesen because he s the moderate governor of a southern state bredesen has been discussed as a possible vice president for obama _meta_end_dot_

 however bredesen has only been in office since _meta_number_ref_ and probably couldn t carry tennessee _meta_end_dot_

 that would seem to make it unlikely that he d get a serious look _meta_end_dot_

 sherrod brown brown is a rabidly liberal senator from ohio he spent _meta_number_ref_ terms in the house and he may be popular enough to turn his home state blue _meta_end_dot_

 if polling data confirms that brown can deliver ohio _meta_number_ref_ electoral votes to obama b o d have to give him a hard look even if he added nothing more to the ticket _meta_end_dot_

 wesley clark the former supreme allied commander europe of nato has military experience and is popular with the netroots but he s a novice politician with a knack for putting his foot in his mouth _meta_end_dot_

 his latest escapade denigrating mccain s military service probably made him too much of a liability to be seriously considered as a veep _meta_end_dot_

 hillary clinton there are a list of reasons as long as your arm why obama should steer clear of hillary like she s on fire the baggage the nasty things she and her husband said about him her lack of experience etc etc _meta_end_dot_

 however a lot of her supporters haven t gotten on board the obama express yet and she may be the only person who can get them on the bandwagon _meta_end_dot_

 what that means is that hillary can probably deliver far more votes than anyone else obama could select as veep and that means that obama will almost have to seriously consider her for vp _meta_end_dot_

 christopher dodd dodd is experienced but he s also punishingly dull and is enmeshed in a countrywide bank subprime mortgage scandal _meta_end_dot_

 that would seem to make it unlikely that obama would give him serious consideration _meta_end_dot_

 tom daschle his name is frequently mentioned as an obama veep possibility because of his experience and liberalism but he has no charisma he s a lobbyist and he s as old school as it gets in politics _meta_end_dot_

 it seems unlikely that a guy like that would fit into a campaign that s supposed to be all about change and a new type of politics john edwards setting aside the fact that he added almost nothing to the ticket when john kerry selected him in _meta_number_ref_ edwards is the white barack obama _meta_end_dot_

 he s an inexperienced pampered liberal wimp whose biggest assets are his charisma and how he looks _meta_end_dot_

 that means edwards would be an unlikely selection _meta_end_dot_

 al gore even though gore couldn t carry his own state when he ran for president in _meta_number_ref_ he would add some gravitas to the ticket _meta_end_dot_

 moreover he d draw liberals out to the polls in an attempt to revenge his loss in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 on the other hand there doesn t seem to be much evidence that gore still has the fire in his belly necessary to take another run at the white house and even if he did would he be willing to settle for being vice president yet again _meta_end_question_

 chuck hagel he s a rabidly anti war pro illegal immigration republican from nebraska with military experience _meta_end_dot_

 at first glance that might make him appear to be an appealing candidate for a man pledging to unify the country _meta_end_dot_

 however hagel s lifetime acu rating is _meta_number_ref_ _meta_percent_ref_ which is actually higher than john mccain s _meta_number_ref_ _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 it s hard to see obama selecting a vice president who is actually to the right of the republican presidential nominee _meta_end_dot_

 tim kaine the current governor of virginia is being widely discussed as a potential veep because he s moderate and could probably help obama carry virginia _meta_number_ref_ electoral votes _meta_end_dot_

 however kaine has only been in office since _meta_number_ref_ and it seems unlikely that a candidate as inexperienced as obama would reach out to a similarly inexperienced governor _meta_end_dot_

 janet napolitano the democratic governor of arizona could be a go to gal if barack feels like he needs a woman on the ticket but can t bear to reach out to the wicked witch of new york _meta_end_dot_

 on the other hand napolitano is a liberal governor with almost no national name recognition who has only been in office since _meta_number_ref_ and probably couldn t even carry her own state for obama _meta_end_dot_

 that would seem to make her an unlikely selection _meta_end_dot_

 bill nelson florida senator bill nelson has a lot of experience a reputation as a moderate and actually once flew on the space shuttle columbia which admittedly is pretty cool _meta_end_dot_

 if obama s polling finds that nelson will give the ticket enough of a boost to carry florida obama would almost have to seriously consider him for the _meta_number_ref_ slot _meta_end_dot_

 sam nunn the experienced former senator from georgia has a lot of gravitas a reputation for being moderate credibility on defense issues speaks southern and could very well turn georgia _meta_number_ref_ electoral votes blue _meta_end_dot_

 it would be difficult for obama to pick a veep who would be at least on paper a better fit for his campaign _meta_end_dot_

 bill richardson richardson s two biggest strengths would be turning new mexico _meta_number_ref_ electoral votes blue in _meta_number_ref_ and helping obama capture the hispanic vote _meta_end_dot_

 however obama is already beating mccain in new mexico and running strong with hispanics so that removes most of the upside from choosing richardson _meta_end_dot_

 brian schweitzer bush won montana in a walk back in _meta_number_ref_ but now the state is close and uber popular democratic governor brian schweitzer would certainly be able to turn the state blue _meta_end_dot_

 on the other hand montana only provides _meta_number_ref_ electoral votes and schweitzer has only been governor since _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 pairing him up with someone as green as obama might be frightening for voters _meta_end_dot_

 kathleen sebelius look at the entry for janet napolitano and change the state to kansas _meta_end_dot_

 you then have the kathleen sebelius entry _meta_end_dot_

 ted strickland strickland has only been governor of ohio since _meta_number_ref_ but he also has _meta_number_ref_ terms in congress under his belt _meta_end_dot_

 although he has little national name recognition he could probably deliver ohio s _meta_number_ref_ electoral votes and that might be enough to merit his selection if he would take the job despite his firm protests to the contrary _meta_end_dot_

 mark warner the moderate former governor of virginia mark warner would likely turn the state _meta_number_ref_ electoral votes blue for the democrats _meta_end_dot_

 warner also speaks southern and would be useful in states like north carolina and georgia where obama hopes to go on the offensive _meta_end_dot_

 on the other hand warner has minimal national name recognition and after only one term as governor of virginia he probably doesn t have enough experience to be obama s veep _meta_end_dot_

 jim webb this senator from virginia might help obama carry the state _meta_number_ref_ electoral votes is popular with the netroots and as a former secretary of the navy he would help shore up obama s non existent military credentials _meta_end_dot_

 on the other hand he s a former republican is mistake prone and has only been in the senate since _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 those negatives might be enough to force him into the _meta_number_ref_nd tier of veep candidates _meta_end_dot_
