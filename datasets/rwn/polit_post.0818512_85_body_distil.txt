  if you ve watched the news you know about the little missing girl from vermont _meta_end_dot_

 well her remains were found yesterday on her uncle s property _meta_end_dot_

 vermont it turns out has a wonderful sex offenders rehabilitation program _meta_end_dot_

 daniel goleman of primal leadership fame enthuses in the new york times fifteen years ago the sex offender treatment program in vermont among the most sophisticated in the country showed similar successes according to a report at the kent state meeting _meta_end_dot_

 in an evaluation of _meta_number_ref_ sex offenders who have been released from prison for up to eight years the average rate of sex crimes in the same period for a comparison group who received no treatment was _meta_number_ref_ percent at least double the rate of those treated for various sex crimes _meta_end_dot_

 for child molesters in the treated group the rate of sex crimes after release from prison was just _meta_number_ref_ percent for exhibitionists or voyeurs _meta_number_ref_ percent for rapists _meta_number_ref_ percent _meta_end_dot_

 while the figure for rapists is highest it is still just half that of those who did not receive any treatment _meta_end_dot_

 to be sure not all sex offenders respond to treatment _meta_end_dot_

 among rapists for instance rape is often more an act of violence than of sex _meta_end_dot_

 this kind of rapist is less likely to benefit than are those for whom fantasies are more important than violence _meta_end_dot_

 so my take away is that treatment may or may not work and we have no way of telling who it will work on but we should be thrilled because maybe it will work on someone _meta_end_dot_

 and of those treated one out of five will offend again _meta_end_dot_

 that means that one out of five will commit a violent rape again _meta_end_dot_

 let s just look at brooke bennett s case _meta_end_dot_

 her uncle michael jacques has done this before in _meta_number_ref_ he was convicted of kidnapping and rape committed in june _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 court records show that the victim was an _meta_number_ref_ year old young woman he supervised at a fast food business in rutland _meta_end_dot_

 the records show he and a friend got her drunk and then jacques alone forced her into his car and over the next four hours raped her several times _meta_end_dot_

 the police affidavit says she was choked with a rope around her neck gagged with a cloth in her mouth and handcuffed with police style cuffs _meta_end_dot_

 police say jacques eventually let her go after he told her he needed help and was going to seek psychiatric counseling _meta_end_dot_

 the victim told police that jacques said he had killed a _meta_number_ref_ year old girl he raped in arizona in _meta_number_ref_ because she threatened to go to the police so he had to kill her and he has been treated in vermont s stellar program the police were unable to confirm his claimed killing of the _meta_number_ref_ year old in arizona but jacques did plead no contest to the charges of kidnap and rape in vermont _meta_end_dot_

 in return under a plea agreement he got six years in prison but was released after serving only four and half with credit for good time _meta_end_dot_

 that _meta_number_ref_ plea deal also required jacques to complete the sex offender treatment program before he could be released from probation _meta_end_dot_

 according to the records he did complete the therapy program and was released from state supervision in december _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 corrections officials say jacques completed his sex offender treatment program in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 do you see how insane it is to release these criminals from prison with or without treatment _meta_end_question_

 if they don t get treatment nearly half repeat offend _meta_end_dot_

 if they do get treatment only one out of five re offend that get caught anyway _meta_end_dot_

 since no one knows who will or who won t re offend why are any of these people released back into the community _meta_end_question_

 and i don t put the flashers or oglers in the same category as a violent rapist _meta_end_dot_

 a violent rapist should know that if he gets convicted he s in prison for life period _meta_end_dot_

 sure some of these guys might reform or go impotent or get too old to have the energy to commit their dastardly deeds _meta_end_dot_

 the problem is since no on knows who will and who won t offend the risk is too great _meta_end_dot_

 let them rot in prison _meta_end_dot_

 keep society safe from these freaks _meta_end_dot_

 prison does not reform these jerks _meta_end_dot_

 at best some inhibit their impulses _meta_end_dot_

 let them be free of temptation _meta_end_dot_

 keep them in prison _meta_end_dot_
