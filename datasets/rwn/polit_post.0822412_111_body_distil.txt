  yesterday i finally got around to seeing the dark knight which looks like it s on pace to crack the _meta_dollor_ref_ million dollar mark domestically _meta_end_dot_

 to be honest i went in wondering if the movie would live up to the hype and for the first _meta_number_ref_ minutes of this _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ hour long flick things seemed a bit slow _meta_end_dot_

 but from there on out this wasn t your parents biff boom kaplow batman _meta_end_dot_

 to the contrary the last two hours of the movie was violent intense and a dark thrill ride piloted by the late great heath ledger who in his final performance turned the joker into one of the greatest villains in cinematic history _meta_end_dot_

 additionally for those that paid attention there was definitely a message in there about the war on terrorism _meta_end_dot_

 even though the joker was chaotic violent and utterly without redeeming qualities the people of gotham started to treat the person doing the most to stop him batman as if he were the real problem _meta_end_dot_

 meanwhile in the process good people died morals were tested and the audience was left with no doubt that even though there were two sides to the fight there was no moral equivalence between them _meta_end_dot_

 that being said this wasn t a perfect film _meta_end_dot_

 the first _meta_number_ref_ minutes were poorly paced there were some unnecessary scenes throughout the movie and the fight sequences were very pedestrian _meta_end_dot_

 still because the joker was such a great villain and because the movie was so intense it s still fair to say this is at a minimum one of the _meta_number_ref_ best super hero movies of all time _meta_end_dot_

 so thumbs way up to the dark knight _meta_end_dot_
