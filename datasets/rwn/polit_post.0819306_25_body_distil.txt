  in my last post i joked that obama wants to take my money and give it to people who don t work as hard as i do _meta_end_dot_

 as with all gross generalizations there are plenty of exceptions _meta_end_dot_

 but how does it hold up as a generalization _meta_end_question_

 when i was a kid i was mowing lawns working on my uncle s farm shoveling snow washing dishes waiting tables and anything else i could do to save for college _meta_end_dot_

 meanwhile i worked hard enough in school to graduate as valedictorian getting a few small scholarships that helped a lot _meta_end_dot_

 my mother took a job on an assembly line to help pay for my college while my dad worked his job in the post office during the day and painted houses on nights and weekends _meta_end_dot_

 and then there was dilbert _meta_end_dot_

 for the first six years i kept my day job and made dilbert comics nights weekends and holidays _meta_end_dot_

 i didn t take a day off for about ten years _meta_end_dot_

 at one point i was doing all of that plus writing a book that became the dilbert principle _meta_end_dot_

 the only time i saw the sun was walking to the mailbox _meta_end_dot_

 and i believe that all of that hard work was necessary for the good things that happened _meta_end_dot_

 the average work week is something like _meta_number_ref_ hours _meta_end_dot_

 for most of my work life i worked about twice that much _meta_end_dot_

 i m writing this blog post on the _meta_number_ref_th of july and have several deadlines to satisfy _meta_end_dot_

 so yes as a generalization obama promises to take a large chunk of my hard earned money and transfer it primarily to people who don t work as hard _meta_end_dot_

 that s just a fact scott adams of dilbert fame hat tip to five feet of fury for the story _meta_end_dot_
