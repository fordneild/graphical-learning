  some of you may want to criticize kenneth thiese from the berkeley daily planet for the excerpt from his work that you re about to read _meta_end_dot_

 while he certainly deserves it he also deserves a great deal of credit for having the courage to say exactly what most liberals and yes i mean most liberals in this country think but don t have the guts to say in the recent political battle around the marine recruiting station in berkeley there has been much confusion around the concept or slogan of supporting the troops but opposing the unjust wars of the bush regime _meta_end_dot_

 many who oppose the bush regime wars also say they support the troops let me say it straight out i do not support the troops and neither should you _meta_end_dot_

 it is objectively impossible to support the troops of the imperialist military forces of the u s _meta_end_dot_

 and at the same time oppose the wars in which they fight _meta_end_dot_

 if you support the troops in iraq afghanistan and the other more than _meta_number_ref_ countries in which they are located you also objectively support u s _meta_end_dot_

 hegemony in the world _meta_end_dot_

 i believe that the vast majority of people who say they support the troops do not wish to support u s _meta_end_dot_

 imperialism but that is what they are really doing by putting forth the slogan of support the troops we need to oppose the recruitment of men and women into the military _meta_end_dot_

 we need to support resisters within the military who have realized what they are doing and now choose to resist the role of the u s _meta_end_dot_

 military _meta_end_dot_

 we need to expose that those in the u s _meta_end_dot_

 military are trained to be part of a killing machine while not every member of the military is an individual murderer they are all part of a system that commits war crimes including aggressive wars massacres rape and other crimes against humanity all in the service of u s _meta_end_dot_

 imperialism _meta_end_dot_

 the bottom line is that even if these people are relatives or friends you can not support the troops without also supporting the objective role that these troops play in the imperialist system _meta_end_dot_

 the only difference between this guy and most of the other liberals in this country is that he s at least honest enough to publicly take the left s views to their logical conclusion _meta_end_dot_

 hat tip to little green footballs for the story _meta_end_dot_
