  question not sure if you have mentioned this on rightwingnews but there are rumors out there that huckabee is at the top of mccain s short list of vp picks _meta_end_dot_

 can you comment please _meta_end_question_

 huckabee tops mccain vp list toddoncapecod answer the veepstakes rumor mill has been spinning fast and furious of late and a different name seems to pop out every time _meta_end_dot_

 there were rumors mccain was looking hard at condi rice then mitt romney and now huck _meta_end_dot_

 now unlike a lot of other bloggers i was a huck fan _meta_end_dot_

 he was my _meta_number_ref_ choice in the primary behind duncan hunter and fred thompson _meta_end_dot_

 granted he was way behind duncan and fred in my book but still i wasn t someone who was hostile to huck _meta_end_dot_

 i tell you that because i don t think he would be a particularly good choice as the veep and i want you to understand that s not just anti huck venom _meta_end_dot_

 that s not to say that huck doesn t have any strengths _meta_end_dot_

 he s extremely charismatic is strong with social conservatives and would help mccain in the south _meta_end_dot_

 however once you get past huck s charisma it s hard to see how any of those other traits would be particularly helpful _meta_end_dot_

 sure huck is strong with social conservatives but as a general rule the same conservatives who don t like mccain don t like huck either _meta_end_dot_

 so anything mccain gained with social conservatives would probably be lost with conservatives in general by adding huck to the ticket _meta_end_dot_

 moreover although huck would help in the south mccain isn t weak in the south _meta_end_dot_

 although there are certainly no guarantees in what is shaping up to be another tough year for republicans mccain probably has at least a _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ shot of winning every southern state against obama _meta_end_dot_

 so from there we re left with huck s charisma which is certainly formidable but probably isn t enough to make up for the malaise huck would cause with conservatives who re not fond of mccain in the first place and would be even less so if he added someone they believe is a big government squish to the ticket _meta_end_dot_

 ps what i d like to see huck do is spend the next four years burnishing his conservative credentials particularly on small government and foreign policy issues and then he could step back into the ring and run again in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 i think huck has the potential to be a real asset to the republican party and the conservative movement but i m just not sure that being mccain s vice president would be the best way for him to do that _meta_end_dot_
