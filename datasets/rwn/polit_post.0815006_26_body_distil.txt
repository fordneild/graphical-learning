  the national museum of crime and punishment which opened last week will feature a special wing dedicated to all hideous aspects of the jimmy carter presidency sources said with semi straight faces _meta_end_dot_

 the exhibit will be rotating and permanent according to museum officials _meta_end_dot_

 thankfully the carter years weren t permanent i can scarcely imagine such horror commented a museum official _meta_end_dot_

 museum patrons upon entering the exhibit will hear carter s infamous july _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ malaise speech in it the president served notice of an american crisis of confidence told his constituents to wear extra clothing in the winter and basically was the largest government induced downer of all time not exactly churchillian fight them anywhere type of rhetoric states the exhibits pamphlet _meta_end_dot_

 it ll set the tone for the rest of the awful depressing uninspirational show said a museum janitor who was given an advance showing of the exhibit and has since lost hair and put on _meta_number_ref_ pounds an added feature will be _meta_number_ref_ era peanuts which will induce nausea upset stomach and possible fits of vomiting barf bags will provided at no extra cost officials said _meta_end_dot_

 my thinking is the carter years were pretty much a crime and the american people were punished _meta_end_dot_
