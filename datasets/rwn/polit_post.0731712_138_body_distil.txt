  if you don t agree with the gang of _meta_number_ref_ solution then i am not your candidate and you should vote for someone else john mccain from the conservative case against john mccain in _meta_number_ref_ just as republicans in congress were about to step in and put an end to the democratic filibusters of judges once and for all john mccain and the rest of the gang of _meta_number_ref_ stepped in with a deal that kept the filibuster alive _meta_end_dot_

 this got john mccain and the other participants in the deal lots of favorable press but the gop paid a real price so that the maverick could be in the spotlight again _meta_end_dot_

 several gop judges were thrown over the side and have as of yet never been allowed to get a vote _meta_end_dot_

 furthermore the gang of _meta_number_ref_ deal explicitly no long applies after the _meta_number_ref_ elections occur _meta_end_dot_

 so if the democrats gain seats in the senate and decide to start filibustering again it s entirely possible that this time the gop won t be able to muster the votes to stop them _meta_end_dot_

 that means that if a liberal supreme court justice steps down during the last two years of bush s term because of john mccain and company it may not be possible to replace them with another alito or roberts _meta_end_dot_

 that s the price the party may have to pay so that john mccain can continue to be the new york times favorite republican _meta_end_dot_
