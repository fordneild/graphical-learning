  this is undoubtedly the most bizarre story that i ve seen in years authorities are considering charges in the bizarre case of a woman who stayed in her boyfriend s bathroom for two years spending most of her time on the toilet so that her body was stuck to the seat by the time the man finally called police _meta_end_dot_

 it appeared the _meta_number_ref_ year old ness city woman s skin had grown around the seat said ness county sheriff bryan whipple _meta_end_dot_

 the woman initially refused emergency medical services but was finally convinced by responders and her boyfriend that she needed to be checked out at a hospital _meta_end_dot_

 we pried the toilet seat off with a pry bar and the seat went with her to the hospital whipple said _meta_end_dot_

 the hospital removed it she was not glued _meta_end_dot_

 she was not tied _meta_end_dot_

 she was just physically stuck by her body whipple said _meta_end_dot_

 it is hard to imagine _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 i still have a hard time imagining it myself mcfarren _meta_number_ref_ told investigators he took babcock food and water and asked her every day to come out of the bathroom _meta_end_dot_

 and her reply would be maybe tomorrow whipple said _meta_end_dot_

 according to him she did not want to leave the bathroom mcfarren told the ap that he wasn t to blame and that it was solely babcock s choice to remain in the bathroom _meta_end_dot_

 she is an adult she made her own decision _meta_end_dot_

 it was my fault i should have gotten help for her sooner i admit that _meta_end_dot_

 but after a while you kind of get used to it mcfarren said _meta_end_dot_

 although authorities said they think babcock was in the bathroom for two years mcfarren said he wasn t certain how long she stayed there _meta_end_dot_

 he said she had a phobia about leaving the room because of childhood beatings _meta_end_dot_

 it just kind of happened one day _meta_end_dot_

 she went in and had been in there a little while the next time it was a little longer _meta_end_dot_

 then she got it in her head she was going to stay like it was a safe place for her mcfarren said _meta_end_dot_

 but mcfarren said babcock moved around in the bathroom during that time bathed and changed into the clothes he brought her _meta_end_dot_

 he said they conversed and had an otherwise normal relationship except that it all happened in the bathroom _meta_end_dot_

 police found babcock clothed and sitting on the toilet her sweat pants down to her mid thigh _meta_end_dot_

 she was somewhat disoriented and her legs looked as if they had atrophied whipple said _meta_end_dot_

 she said that she didn t need any help that she was ok and did not want to leave he said _meta_end_dot_

 mcfarren said that his girlfriend has an infection in her legs that has damaged her nerves and that she has no feeling in her legs _meta_end_dot_

 she may wind up in a wheelchair he said _meta_end_dot_

 it really doesn t surprise me ellis said _meta_end_dot_

 what surprises me is somebody wasn t called in a bit earlier you got to love the understatement of that last sentence what surprises me is somebody wasn t called in a bit earlier she was in there for _meta_number_ref_ years so yes it is fair to say that was just a wee bit too long _meta_end_dot_

 i mean personally i know how long women take to get ready when they go in the bathroom but you know after say oh _meta_number_ref_ or _meta_number_ref_ months i think i would have started to get worried _meta_end_dot_

 i at least hope there was a newspaper and a couple of magazines in there _meta_end_dot_

 that always helps pass time in the bathroom _meta_end_dot_

 on the other hand maybe i should look at it from the guy s perspective _meta_end_dot_

 he was probably just jazzed that his girlfriend had decided to move in with him _meta_end_dot_

 plus they probably had a lot of conversations that went about like this come on what s wrong honey if you don t know i am not telling you then you know what are you going to do _meta_end_question_

 also we can t forget that women are always complaining that men don t want commitment but that is one committed guy to allow his girlfriend to hog the bathroom for two years _meta_end_dot_

 in all seriousness you think she actually slept on the toilet _meta_end_question_

 was there another bathroom in the house or did they have to share that one _meta_end_question_

 did the guy ever have company over and were they like gee how come your girlfriend has been in the bathroom all night didn t anyone notice she hadn t left the house for two years _meta_end_question_

 moreover the guy says that she moved around the bathroom but the report says her body was stuck to the seat that implies she was sitting there for a long long time _meta_end_dot_

 so is she mentally ill or did this guy somehow abuse her into staying in the bathroom and she s just too traumatized to admit it _meta_end_question_

 no matter how you slice it this is one freaky case _meta_end_dot_
