  tragically gary gygax the man who is generally considered to be the founder of dungeons and dragons has shuffled off this mortal coil _meta_end_dot_

 normally when famous people pass on i like to write a post giving my condolences to their family and friends _meta_end_dot_

 granted they ll probably never read it but it s the thought that counts _meta_end_dot_

 in this case i feel like i should say a little more because i spent countless hours geeking out enjoying myself playing gary gygax s creation _meta_end_dot_

 that always sounds dorky to say but i figure if michelle malkin and vin diesel indulged too how bad can it really be _meta_end_question_

 i got started playing in my early teens when my mother ran across a bunch of d d stuff cheap at a yard sale and bought it for me _meta_end_dot_

 i immediately took to it like a fish to water bought new books and really got into playing _meta_end_dot_

 that came to horrify my mother because in those days it seemed like every few weeks you d read about some wack job taking a sword to his neighbors because he played d d for so long that he began to believe that they were drow who planned to poison him when he slept so they could steal his magic _meta_number_ref_ hairdryer _meta_end_dot_

 still i kept playing but the problem with d d was always that the game was only as good as the people you were playing with _meta_end_dot_

 you play with a bunch of annoying goofs and it sucks _meta_end_dot_

 you play with interesting people with great personalities and the game is a lot of fun _meta_end_dot_

 the best group i ever played with was in charlotte after college _meta_end_dot_

 we d actually have all night d d marathons get a few hours sleep load up on mountain dew and doritos and do it again the whole next day and make no mistake about it i was not just a casual player i was a total and utter d d junky ehr let me clarify _meta_end_dot_

 i wasn t into the costume play or the renaissance fair stuff _meta_end_dot_

 you know let s all dress up like wood elves and pretend to fight goblins in the basement no thank you but i practically had the manuals memorized and even ran some campaigns _meta_end_dot_

 eventually the game lost its magic for me and i stopped playing _meta_end_dot_

 you might think that was because i finally grew up but if that were true i wouldn t still be playing ps_meta_number_ref_ every so often and watching cartoons _meta_end_dot_

 was it fun _meta_end_question_

 oh yeah it was but more importantly playing with all those dice ended up giving me a freaky feel for statistics that really comes in handy when i m trying to decipher poll results _meta_end_dot_

 in other words i now use the skills i developed trying to figure out if i could make my saving throw against turning to stone after looking at a medusa to figure out whether congressional districts are going to stay blue or turn red in the next election _meta_end_dot_

 what can i say _meta_end_question_

 it works really well _meta_end_dot_

 creating a popular game isn t exactly inventing the steam engine but there s something to be said for coming up with a product that brought so many people together to socialize and have a great time _meta_end_dot_

 so for all the good times i and everyone else had playing d d may the good lord give gary gygax a couple of extra saving throws against ehr being charmed by harps _meta_end_question_

 falling off of clouds _meta_end_question_

 i have no idea what he d need the saving throws for but still it s the thought that counts _meta_end_dot_
