  when you have _meta_number_ref_ candidates on the stage all of whom essentially have almost exactly the same position on every issue it makes for a debate that sounds about like this exchange from futurama john jackson it s time someone had the courage to stand up and say i m against those things that everybody hates john jackson i say your three cent titanium tax goes too far dull dull debate _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ bill richardson loser a lot of people thought this guy was the moderate candidate going in but he sounded as radical as dennis kucinich on foreign policy tonight _meta_end_dot_

 he also looked constipated and slightly ill _meta_end_dot_

 he stood out for those reasons and came in the bottom spot between the three other candidates _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ john edwards he finished _meta_number_ref_nd in iowa he looks destined to finish in _meta_number_ref_rd in nh and at that point he might as well just drop out because he s done _meta_end_dot_

 nothing he said tonight is probably going to change where he s destined to finish because he was very plain jane thus he finishes in the _meta_number_ref_ slot _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ hillary clinton i went back and forth between sticking her in the _meta_number_ref_ or _meta_number_ref_ slot because she sounded better than obama on foreign policy and came across as genuinely warm and natural a few times i wonder who taught her how to do that but she also came across as angry and shrill at times _meta_end_dot_

 angry and shrill beat out warm and authentic _meta_end_dot_

 so _meta_number_ref_ it is for hillary _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ barack obama winner you could feel a change in the air tonight from the previous debates _meta_end_dot_

 this time obama looked like he was in the catbird s seat and hillary was the challenger trying to score points against the front runner _meta_end_dot_

 did obama come across as well as he has in previous debates _meta_end_question_

 no _meta_end_dot_

 did he say anything profound _meta_end_question_

 no _meta_end_dot_

 but he was likable friendly and the guy has a great voice _meta_end_dot_

 it almost makes you wonder if the let s get ready to rumble guy could pull _meta_percent_ref_ in a primary based on how he sounded _meta_end_dot_

 update _meta_number_ref_ lorie byrd on obama s claim that the democratic congress deserved credit for the surge s success _meta_end_dot_
