  a five year old probably with asperger s syndrome but as yet undiagnosed boy stays home after being voted out of his class by his classmates at the behest of his unapologetic teacher _meta_end_dot_

 like the case of the woman harassing her daughter s depressive friend via myspace this case is unfathomable _meta_end_dot_

 in fact when i read about this last night i didn t blog about it _meta_end_dot_

 i just didn t know how to respond to an example of such callous disregard and stupidity _meta_end_dot_

 my son has asperger s syndrome and he is indeed a challenge in the classroom not because he s a behavior problem but because he just requires extra help to stay on task understand the assignment and decide what to do next _meta_end_dot_

 for a young child with asperger s syndrome the classroom is an overload of stimuli _meta_end_dot_

 so depending on the school s philosophy the child might end up in special education with the mentally retarded and behavior problem children _meta_end_dot_

 the only problem is that the children with asperger s syndrome have normal i q s _meta_end_dot_

 and are often underestimated _meta_end_dot_

 teachers are frustrated because they have other children in the classroom that need to be taught _meta_end_dot_

 a lazy or immature or stupid teacher takes it out on the child when the problem can only be resolved with the school administration and parents _meta_end_dot_

 a good teacher manages and some dedicated teachers give extra time and view the special child as a challenge to be helped _meta_end_dot_

 parents are frustrated _meta_end_dot_

 if they get their child diagnosed it often means medication and lowered academic expectations causing the child to fall behind _meta_end_dot_

 the average asperger s child graduates high school with a second grade education _meta_end_dot_

 in fact around sixth grade many of these children fall irreparably behind but not for lack of intelligence _meta_end_dot_

 this is a towering educational failure with life long implications for the child _meta_end_dot_

 what many of these children need but rarely get is one on one intensive intervention in the early educational years gradually phasing it out as the child grows _meta_end_dot_

 this is expensive true _meta_end_dot_

 but it is far cheaper than having a child on life long disability because he hasn t been taught the skills to work and get through the day _meta_end_dot_

 the barton s like many families didn t get their child diagnosed until the child is in school and they re still working on it _meta_end_dot_

 the infant and toddler and pre school development of the child is uneven but normal enough to not raise flags with parents and pediatricians _meta_end_dot_

 stick the child in an over stimulating environment where constant demands are made and suddenly everyone knows something is wrong _meta_end_dot_

 this is a traumatic time for parents _meta_end_dot_

 it is an upsetting one for teachers _meta_end_dot_

 no one likes to bear this news _meta_end_dot_

 another thing to consider many five year olds are emotionally immature or developmentally uneven _meta_end_dot_

 some can read _meta_end_dot_

 some can t _meta_end_dot_

 some can count _meta_end_dot_

 some can t _meta_end_dot_

 some can sit still _meta_end_dot_

 some can t _meta_end_dot_

 kindergarten isn t about heavy duty academics so how is this child disrupting the education of others as some have suggested _meta_end_question_

 wendy portillo the child s teacher put alex barton a five year old in front of his classmates and asked each child to say something that annoyed them about the child _meta_end_dot_

 they then voted whether or not to keep him in the class _meta_end_dot_

 only two out of the fourteen children voted to keep him in the room but the children are five and hardly have an understanding of what they were being asked _meta_end_dot_

 imagine for a moment a teacher doing this to your child _meta_end_dot_

 it is cruel beyond all comprehension _meta_end_dot_

 melissa barton alex s mom was just lucky that her son is verbal enough that he could tell her what happened _meta_end_dot_

 many children with asperger s and autism including my son have great difficulty with expressive language _meta_end_dot_

 something like this could happen to an autistic child and his parents would never know _meta_end_dot_

 the challenge of educating bright but developmentally different children is not going away _meta_end_dot_

 for whatever reason the numbers of these children are still increasing _meta_end_dot_

 parents teachers and school districts need to stop living in denial _meta_end_dot_

 i saw one teacher comment saying that parents should take their own medicine and be responsible for teaching their own child _meta_end_dot_

 well i did that this last year with my son _meta_end_dot_

 the modifications made for him here at home helped him learn but i still had to pay my taxes so the normal kids can go to school _meta_end_dot_

 implement vouchers _meta_end_dot_

 now _meta_end_dot_

 i would gladly pull my child out of public school for the rest of his education but the way it stands now my only choice is to educate my son on my own dime while paying taxes so teachers can teach the easy kids _meta_end_dot_

 the teacher needs to decide whether she supports her own union _meta_end_dot_

 vouchers and educational reform would be a solution to this _meta_end_dot_

 choice _meta_end_dot_

 parents could vote with their money _meta_end_dot_

 no doubt schools and teachers that catered to special kids would pop up _meta_end_dot_

 now this is a way to put democracy in action teachers _meta_end_dot_

 voting is great when the person being voted on isn t the teacher _meta_end_dot_

 that s just a little too uncomfortable _meta_end_dot_

 bottom line i hope ms _meta_end_dot_

 barton sues the teacher and the school _meta_end_dot_

 this outrage is just the most extreme version of a system that teaches to the mean and is inept at educating those who fall outside of a very narrow normal _meta_end_dot_
