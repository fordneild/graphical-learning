  unlimited power the new science of personal achievement and awaken the giant within how to take immediate control of your mental emotional physical and financial destiny _meta_end_exclamation_

 multiple times _meta_end_dot_

 any time you sincerely want to make a change the first thing you must do is to raise your standards _meta_end_dot_

 when people ask me what really changed my life eight years ago i tell them that absolutely the most important thing was changing what i demanded of myself _meta_end_dot_

 i wrote down all the things i would no longer accept in my life all the things i would no longer tolerate and all the things that i aspired to becoming if you develop the absolute sense of certainty that powerful beliefs provide then you can get yourself to accomplish virtually anything including those things that other people are certain are impossible it s not knowing what to do it s doing what you know making a true decision means committing yourself to achieving a result and then cutting yourself off from any other possibility if you question anything enough you ll begin to doubt it nothing in life has any real meaning except the meaning you give it your emotions are nothing but biochemical storms in your brain and you are in control of them at any point in time in life never spend more than _meta_percent_ref_ of your time on the problem and spend at least _meta_percent_ref_ of your time on the solution the only way for us to have long term happiness is to live by our highest ideals the past does not equal the future if you don t set a baseline standard for what you ll accept in life you ll find it s easy to slip into behaviors and attitudes or a quality of life that s far below what you deserve most people fail in life because they major in minor things goals are a means to an end not the ultimate purpose of our lives _meta_end_dot_

 they are simply a tool to concentrate our focus and move us in a direction _meta_end_dot_

 the only reason we really pursue goals is to cause ourselves to expand and grow _meta_end_dot_

 achieving goals by themselves will never make us happy in the long term it s who you become as you overcome the obstacles necessary to achieve your goals that can give you the deepest and most long lasting sense of fulfillment if you want to be successful find someone who has achieved the results you want and copy what they do and you ll achieve the same results all personal breakthroughs begin with a change in beliefs _meta_end_dot_

 so how do we change _meta_end_question_

 the most effective way is to get your brain to associate massive pain to the old belief _meta_end_dot_

 you must feel deep in your gut that not only has this belief cost you pain in the past but it s costing you in the present and ultimately can only bring you pain in the future _meta_end_dot_

 then you must associate tremendous pleasure to the idea of adopting a new empowering belief everything happens for a reason and a purpose and it serves you things do not have meaning _meta_end_dot_

 we assign meaning to everything more than anything else i believe it s our decisions not the conditions of our lives that determine our destiny the secret of success is learning how to use pain and pleasure instead of having pain and pleasure use you _meta_end_dot_

 if you do that you re in control of your life _meta_end_dot_

 if you don t life controls you success is doing what you want to do when you want where you want with whom you want as much as you want whatever happens take responsibility repetition is the mother of all skill if we link massive pain to any behavior or emotional pattern we will avoid indulging in it at all costs _meta_end_dot_

 we can use this understanding to harness the force of pain and pleasure to change virtually anything in our lives we re often seduced into believing that events control our lives and that our environment has shaped who we are today _meta_end_dot_

 no greater lie was ever told _meta_end_dot_

 it s not the events of our lives that shape us but our beliefs as to what those events mean with enough emotional intensity and repetition our nervous systems experience something as real even if it hasn t occurred yet if you question anything enough you ll begin to doubt it the way to expand our lives is to model the lives of those people who are already succeeding all changes are created in a moment _meta_end_dot_

 it s just that most of us wait until certain things happen before we finally decide to make a shift to paraphrase the philosopher nietzsche he who has a strong enough why can bear any how _meta_end_dot_

 i ve found that _meta_number_ref_ percent of any change is knowing how but _meta_number_ref_ percent is knowing why _meta_end_dot_

 if we gather a set of strong enough reasons to change we can change we can change in a minute something we ve failed to change for years any pattern or emotion or behavior that is continually reinforced will become an automatic and conditioned response _meta_end_dot_

 anything we fail to reinforce will eventually dissipate we must remember that all decision making comes down to values clarification you could be winning and feel like you re losing because the scorecard you re using is unfair at the base of every emotional upset you ve ever had with another human being is a rules upset _meta_end_dot_

 somebody did something or failed to do something that violated one of our rules about what they must or should do so if you ever feel angry or upset with someone remember it s your rules that are upsetting you not their behavior
