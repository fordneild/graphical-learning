  when a daily kos diary includes this line you know it must really be goofy my simple suggestion that this could be a trap fell beyond the pale for the new moderators over at huffpo yes when what you re saying is too out there for the people at the huffington post that is probably an indication that it s really coo coo for cocoa puffs oh and it was _meta_end_dot_

 from daily kos diarist st_meta_number_ref_p here s the latest evil plan from the bush administration mcbush and company are counting the days before obama will return to iraq _meta_end_dot_

 nothing will suit the neocon s plans better than obama giving them photo opportunities with the usual sales gang put forward by psy ops _meta_end_dot_

 my simple suggestion that this could be a trap fell beyond the pale for the new moderators over at huffpo let s see how it fares here _meta_end_dot_

 darth cheney has made repeated promises to both the saudi royals and the israeli likudists in my minds ear that america will destroy the energy capabilities of iran but to date darth has not been able to manufacture the impetus for it _meta_end_dot_

 my conspiracy theory is that a false flag attack on obama would inspire the shock and anger of the american people to give the green light for the mass bombing of iran perhaps including nukes so mccain goads obama into going to iraq to see the war he wants to lose if he becomes president and then the bush family evil empire goons wack barry and pin the blame on iran _meta_end_dot_

 then that asassination would be used to justify a war with iran on behalf of the saudi royals and israeli likudists _meta_end_dot_

 it s sort of a kill two birds with one stone operation _meta_end_dot_

 of course it would also probably lead to president hillary rodham clinton but the kossacks are so far gone at this point they probably think she s an honorary member of the vast right wing conspiracy so that probably doesn t trouble them _meta_end_dot_

 ps if you ever notice that having a conversation with a liberal friend is difficult it s because this is how their minds work _meta_end_dot_

 you say something like well if obama is going to throw the whole war away for politics sake he should at least go over and talk to the troops first and they re thinking oh my god _meta_end_exclamation_

 he s part of the plot to start a war with iran it s like trying to have a conversation with someone who thinks _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ s orange _meta_end_dot_

 hat tip to moonbattery for the story _meta_end_dot_
