  while mingling amongst the guests i heard the following bush is an idiot getting shot down in a war zone doesn t automatically make mccain qualified to be cic they shouldn t have tried to impeach bill clinton for lying about an affair _meta_end_dot_

 all guys lie about affairs when first confronted about them _meta_end_dot_

 bush lied and sent our military men and women to a foreign country to die for a lie we better pray obama gets elected so republicans will start acting like republicans again when i pointed out that obama would have an even more solid democrat majority in congress to work with than is there now it had no effect obama s acting like he s already president with that speech he made in berlin _meta_end_dot_

 at least he s not a gaffe machine like bush clearly his world tour is helping him we need to improve our standing in the world can t people give it a freaking rest for a few hours for a wedding reception _meta_end_question_
