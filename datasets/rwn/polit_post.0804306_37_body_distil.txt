  predicting whom a particular candidate will take as vice president is always difficult because so many factors play into it _meta_end_dot_

 do both candidates get along _meta_end_question_

 is the presidential nominee looking to carry a particular state region or demographic group is he looking to solidify his base or is he just trying to add strength across the board in a general election _meta_end_question_

 in the case of mr _meta_end_dot_

 maverick it s even tougher than normal to predict whom he might choose _meta_end_dot_

 logic says that he should take a rock ribbed conservative to try to shore up relations with his own party but there s no way to predict at this point if mccain will go that way _meta_end_dot_

 still here are a few guesses at potential names mccain may consider haley barbour barbour is very conservative a former republican national committee chairman and the governor of mississippi _meta_end_dot_

 he also attracted nationwide attention by doing a phenomenal job in the aftermath of katrina even as the incompetents in charge in new orleans botched the job _meta_end_dot_

 on the other hand mississippi is not exactly a swing state he has been involved in some race based controversies and he probably wouldn t add much to the ticket outside of the south _meta_end_dot_

 marsha blackburn the tn congresswoman is attractive has a superb personality and has a _meta_percent_ref_ lifetime acu rating _meta_end_dot_

 she would be a fantastic choice if mccain wanted to reach out to conservative voters and women voters at the same time _meta_end_dot_

 of course blackburn has only been in office since _meta_number_ref_ but that still makes her more experienced than barack obama _meta_end_dot_

 how seriously mccain would look at blackburn is hard to say but at first glance she would appear to be an excellent choice for veep _meta_end_dot_

 tom coburn coburn is a rock ribbed conservative with particularly outstanding credentials on illegal immigration and fiscal conservatism _meta_end_dot_

 moreover he has endorsed mccain and worked with him many times on issues of fiscal conservatism _meta_end_dot_

 however he s not that charismatic and oklahoma isn t exactly expected to be a battleground state in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 that means he may not add enough to the ticket overall to be seriously considered _meta_end_dot_

 charlie crist florida has been a key swing state in the last two elections and for that reason crist who is the extremely popular governor of that state would probably be considered _meta_end_dot_

 however crist has only been governor since _meta_number_ref_ and that along with his limited appeal outside of florida will probably knock him out of the running _meta_end_dot_

 jim demint demint is relatively young feisty is a decent speaker and is extremely well liked by conservatives _meta_end_dot_

 he would be a good choice to shore up mccain s right side _meta_end_dot_

 however demint has yet to finish his first term in the senate which may keep him from getting serious consideration as veep he has already spent _meta_number_ref_ terms in the house though _meta_end_dot_

 elizabeth dole liddy is a little long in the tooth to be veep but she has actually accomplished more in her life than hillary clinton and would definitely have the gravitas to beat her up and take the women s vote from hill if she gets the nomination _meta_end_dot_

 rudy giuliani ideologically rudy would seem to be a better match for mccain than some of the other candidates being discussed and he could campaign for mccain in the purple swing states but having a pro abortion moderate with a messy private life probably wouldn t do much to paper over mccain s problems with conservatives _meta_end_dot_

 mike huckabee huckabee is dogged charismatic and seems to be well liked by evangelicals but most of the same conservatives who don t like mccain also don t like huckabee _meta_end_dot_

 so it s hard to imagine his adding much to the ticket aside from the sheer force of his personality _meta_end_dot_

 yet and still if huck can stay in the race long enough and perform well enough he may be able to force mccain to give him a vp slot in return for getting out _meta_end_dot_

 duncan hunter my former employer is a very conservative experienced republican who served in the armed forces and has enormous credibility on border issues so he could give the ticket a boost there and help out mccain with the base _meta_end_dot_

 however he didn t do very well in the primaries so how much of an asset he would be as vice president is an open question _meta_end_dot_

 kay bailey hutchison she has a reputation for not being particularly conservative on life and immigration issues although her lifetime acu rating is a sterling _meta_number_ref_ _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 on the other hand she is more accomplished than hillary and could help mccain reach out to the women s vote _meta_end_dot_

 joe lieberman picking mccain s friend joe lieberman an independent with strong foreign policy credentials but who is weak everywhere else from a conservative point of view would do even more damage to mccain with conservatives while burnishing his appeal to independents _meta_end_dot_

 given how much trouble mccain is having with winning over conservatives selecting lieberman would be a particularly bad move but you know we are talking about maverick john mccain here _meta_end_dot_

 sarah palin she s the extremely popular very attractive very young governor of alaska _meta_end_dot_

 she s appealing and fairly conservative but she s a little too inexperienced for the job since she s only been governor of alaska since _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 tim pawlenty pawlenty is the governor of minnesota which could be a key swing state in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 he s also relatively young conservative and endorsed mccain early on _meta_end_dot_

 you have to think that pawlenty will be one of the candidates who gets a really hard look from mccain _meta_end_dot_

 mike pence the relatively young indiana congressman is a favorite with conservatives even though he is a little squishy on illegal immigration _meta_end_dot_

 however although he is a good guy he comes across as a little bit too much of a policy wonk to be an ideal choice _meta_end_dot_

 rick perry texas is an important state for republicans and perry who is fiscally and socially conservative might get a looksie for that reason _meta_end_dot_

 the flip side of that is that mccain shouldn t need perry s help to carry texas his weak record on immigration would be aggravating to a lot of conservatives and he probably wouldn t add much to the campaign nationally _meta_end_dot_

 rob portman portman is a former director of the office of management and budget a former united states trade representative and he spent a decade in congress in the key state of ohio _meta_end_dot_

 he s also a long time friend of john mccain _meta_end_dot_

 however it s doubtful whether he could reassure conservatives or swing ohio so it s hard to see that he would add a lot to the ticket despite how often his name seems to come up for the job _meta_end_dot_

 colin powell powell is very moderate a little too old to be veep and wouldn t do much to excite the republican base _meta_end_dot_

 however he s also very popular with the american people is considerably more accomplished than obama and would steal a lot of obambi s thunder if he turns out to be the nominee _meta_end_dot_

 condi rice on the upside after being secretary of state condi is certainly qualified to be vice president and she would undercut obama or hillary s change appeal if she s the veep _meta_end_dot_

 on the other hand she s very closely connected to bush has never run for public office before very little is known about her domestic views and she has turned in a less than stellar performance as secretary of state _meta_end_dot_

 tom ridge ridge is a longtime friend of mccain who spent a decade in the house was governor of pennsylvania and the first united states secretary of homeland security _meta_end_dot_

 on the other hand he doesn t have a reputation as a staunch conservative he s closely connected with bush and it s doubtful that he could carry pennsylvania _meta_end_dot_

 that means he would add very little to the ticket _meta_end_dot_

 mitt romney although there seemed to be a surge of enthusiasm for romney late in the game it was more anti mccain than pro romney and with that in mind romney wouldn t seem to be a great addition as the vp _meta_end_dot_

 plus as an added bonus mccain and romney don t seem to like each other very much _meta_end_dot_

 so it s hard to see mccain offering romney the job _meta_end_dot_

 mark sanford the governor of south carolina is under _meta_number_ref_ very conservative particularly very fiscally conservative and could help insure that mccain holds the south _meta_end_dot_

 on the other hand he has low name recognition and hopefully mccain isn t going to need much help holding the south _meta_end_dot_

 fred thompson the fred would seem at first glance to be an intriguing pick _meta_end_dot_

 he generated genuine enthusiasm from the base he s good friends with john mccain and he didn t criticize mccain very often _meta_end_dot_

 but he also didn t set the world on fire when he was on the campaign trail he ran a campaign that was way off to mccain s right and he s another very old looking guy _meta_end_dot_

 plus would he really want to give up law and order to get back on the campaign trail for months _meta_end_question_

 john thune he s a young extremely conservative senator from south dakota who spent _meta_number_ref_ terms in the house and then knocked off tom daschle in the _meta_number_ref_ election _meta_end_dot_

 he also campaigned hard for john mccain _meta_end_dot_

 his upside would be that mccain could use him as an ambassador to conservatives but otherwise he might not be of much help since south dakota isn t exactly going to be a swing state in the election _meta_end_dot_

 jc watts he is a former football star who was also the last black republican to serve in congress _meta_end_dot_

 additionally watts is well liked by conservatives and was the man who coined the phrase race hustling poverty pimps however he does have some baggage and has been out of congress for a few years now _meta_end_dot_

 ps personally if i were mccain the three candidates i d take a hard look at first out of this batch would be marsha blackburn tim pawlenty and jim demint _meta_end_dot_

 ps _meta_number_ref_ just in case you re wondering i left off _meta_end_dot_

 bobby jindal because he s too young _meta_end_dot_

 jeb bush because there s no way mccain would even consider another bush _meta_end_dot_

 christie todd whitman because she would be the weakest female pick on this list by far _meta_end_dot_

 phil gramm because i think he s much more likely to be chosen as secretary of the treasury than veep _meta_end_dot_

 david petraeus tommy franks because they would add little to the ticket of a man like mccain who has military experience _meta_end_dot_

 ps _meta_number_ref_ i added in rick perry and john thune after the post originally came out _meta_end_dot_
