  question who was the worst united states president in the _meta_number_ref_th century jimmy carter or fdr applemacjimmy answer fdr was a disaster domestically who pushed incredibly harmful socialistic policies that extended the depression for years _meta_end_dot_

 the supreme court went horribly awry under pressure from fdr as well _meta_end_dot_

 however he deserves an enormous amount of credit for his outstanding farsighted leadership during ww_meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 so fdr was a mixed bag _meta_end_dot_

 on the other hand there is very little to recommend jimmy carter as a president _meta_end_dot_

 he was utterly incompetent naive he damaged the economy caused gas lines gave away the panama canal botched iran you name it and he screwed up _meta_end_dot_

 personally i tend to vacillate between carter and lyndon johnson when i m trying to decide who the worst president of the last century was _meta_end_dot_

 on the one hand carter was perfectly hapless but johnson was responsible for the socialistic great society the problems we currently have with social security and the vietnam war _meta_end_dot_

 so i d say johnson was the worst president of the last century and maybe the worst us president ever with carter right behind him as the worst president of the _meta_number_ref_th century _meta_end_dot_
