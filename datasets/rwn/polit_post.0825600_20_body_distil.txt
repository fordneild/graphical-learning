  here s what he says she said allah says totally untrue but that s what he gets for relying on the associated press which took the liberty of bowdlerizing her quote mid sentence in order to make it fit the narrative they were trying to build of her as some fundie who thinks she can read god s mind _meta_end_dot_

 here s my post on the subject from last thursday _meta_end_dot_

 read it and see just how egregious the distortion here is _meta_end_dot_

 pray for our military men and women who are striving to do what is right _meta_end_dot_

 also for this country that our leaders our national leaders are sending u s _meta_end_dot_

 soldiers out on a task that is from god she exhorted the congregants _meta_end_dot_

 that s what we have to make sure that we re praying for that there is a plan and that that plan is god s plan allah continues here s what the ap turns it into alaska gov _meta_end_dot_

 sarah palin told ministry students at her former church that the united states sent troops to fight in the iraq war on a task that is from god _meta_end_dot_

 our national leaders are sending them out on a task that is from god she said _meta_end_dot_

 that s what we have to make sure that we re praying for that there is a plan and that plan is god s plan people depend on the press to deliver the news _meta_end_dot_

 all of it so that it is the truth and not some part or piece that helps them _meta_end_dot_

 charlie gibson gave weight to an untruth so governor palin had to respond to something she didn t really say _meta_end_dot_

 and so when she said i don t think that s what i said and that isn t what she said it sounds like she s not willing to stand by her words _meta_end_dot_

 and when gibson says i have the quote right here how from memory is she going to dispute that _meta_end_question_

 this type of thing undermines a free pres and a free society _meta_end_dot_

 okay via the anchoress she mentions that ann althouse s readers would like a side by side with a charlie gibson obama interview _meta_end_dot_

 so here it is about two minutes in you get the feel _meta_end_dot_

 again with the bad lighting and weird camera angles _meta_end_dot_

 maybe the abc producers just suck _meta_end_dot_

 but i get the feeling that the interaction is warm and chummy _meta_end_dot_

 what do you think _meta_end_question_

 i don t see the arrogant look down the nose distaste for obama that i saw with palin _meta_end_dot_

 the anchoress notes also i must say when palin replied that she was ready to lead and gibson responded with doesn t that take hubris i was completely offended _meta_end_dot_

 anyone who is running for these offices had damn well feel confident that they are ready to lead from day one _meta_end_dot_

 furthermore has biden even been asked if he feels ready to lead _meta_end_question_

 because i m getting the impression lately that he does not _meta_end_dot_

 and does gibson find obama s saying he is ready to lead too hubristic since he has never held any sort of executive position _meta_end_question_

 that one pissed me off and it raised my feminist hackles too _meta_end_dot_

 it was a man giving a woman crap for declaring that she was capable _meta_end_dot_

 generally the press is biased against religion _meta_end_dot_

 newt gingrich rightly chastised them _meta_end_dot_

 alan colmes sat doe eyed and simply did not get it _meta_end_dot_

 when i get the quote i ll share it with you _meta_end_dot_

 over at stoptheaclu the writer got the same feeling i did i feel just like roger below about this interview _meta_end_dot_

 charlie gibson s sneering condescending tone looking down over the rim of his glasses like he s some snobby intellectual made me a little sick _meta_end_dot_

 but twisting her words into a fabrication of his own illogical fear of theocracy was utterly insulting especially after insisting those words were exact which was just a straight up lie _meta_end_dot_

 this was palin s first effort _meta_end_dot_

 she ll get better _meta_end_dot_

 she s smart _meta_end_dot_

 the press _meta_end_question_

 they ll get worse _meta_end_dot_

 the contempt for religion shows contempt not just for her but for religious americans _meta_end_dot_

 updated gateway pundit calls it a hatchet job _meta_end_dot_

 michelle malkin says abc blows it _meta_end_dot_

 yes they blow the notion that they re unbiased _meta_end_dot_

 kathryn lopez asks is it me _meta_end_question_

 or was charlie gibson just condescendingly explaining the world to sarah palin it wasn t just you _meta_end_dot_

 at suitably flip charlie gibson calls sarah palin a mannish provincial whore and those were his exact words sister toldjah feels that palin did fine me too _meta_end_dot_

 allah thinks gibson is condescending but that palin did fine _meta_end_dot_

 if there s something i missed highly likely instapundit probably grabbed it _meta_end_dot_

 the man misses little _meta_end_dot_
