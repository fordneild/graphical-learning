  on memorial day rolling thunder bikers tipped their hats to america s heroes with a patriotic roll through the nation s capital _meta_end_dot_

 public radio s garrison keillor turned up his nose in disgust a patriotic bike rally is sort of like a patriotic toilet papering or patriotic graffiti the patriotism somehow gets lost in the sheer irritation of the thing _meta_end_dot_

 anything patriotic is going to irritate moonbats like keillor who dismisses the bikers as fat men with ponytails and even accuses them of not showing their support in a more tangible way in iraq as if most of them weren t vets apparently unlike keillor himself _meta_end_dot_

 he sniffs that if the patriots really cared about the war dead they would be at home reading books _meta_end_dot_

 according to keillor the vulgarity of patriotism squats on you like an enormous toad leaving a person exposed to it depressed for hours _meta_end_dot_

 fortunately keillor was able to escape into the national gallery where he found relief by gazing profoundly upon drab but highly cultured european paintings _meta_end_dot_

 keillor is why it would be better to flush a dollar down the toilet than let the government steal a penny for public radio _meta_end_dot_

 patriotism squats on keillor like a fellow toad _meta_end_dot_
