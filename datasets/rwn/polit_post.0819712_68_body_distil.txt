  e rick erickson found some very interesting info which he shares with us at redstate _meta_end_dot_

 but first a little reminder _meta_end_dot_

 november _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ chicago tribune in a story entitled court to hear gun case the chicago tribune s james oliphant and michael j _meta_end_dot_

 higgins wrote _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 the campaign of democratic presidential hopeful barack obama said that he believes that we can recognize and respect the rights of law abiding gun owners and the right of local communities to enact common sense laws to combat violence and save lives _meta_end_dot_

 obama believes the d c _meta_end_dot_

 handgun law is constitutional _meta_end_dot_

 that was when we first heard the term inartful used to characterize his previous response that statement was obviously an inartful attempt to explain the senator s consistent position obama spokesman bill burton tells abc news _meta_end_dot_

 it was inartful because the wind had shifted and heller had been decided against dc and the vast majority of the country was applauding the decision _meta_end_dot_

 so he was suddenly all for the decision wording his statement in such a way that it appeared the court had finally come around to his way of thinking in response to the ruling obama issued a carefully worded statement that applauded the court for providing much needed guidance to local jurisdictions across the country on gun rights while the candidate straddled differences between gun control advocates and defenders of the right to bear arms _meta_end_dot_

 obama said he has always believed that the _meta_number_ref_nd amendment protects the right of individuals to bear arms but i also identify with the need for crime ravaged communities to save their children from the violence that plagues our streets through common sense effective safety measures the presumptive democratic presidential nominee added that the supreme court has now endorsed that view noting that the court opinion striking down the capital s handgun ban concedes the right to gun ownership is not absolute and is subject to reasonable regulations well not really but that s his spin and he s sticking with it _meta_end_dot_

 which brings us to what erik found _meta_end_dot_

 it has to do with his time in the illinois senate _meta_end_dot_

 in the case of these bills he decided to vote something other than present _meta_end_dot_

 the bills dealt directly with a homeowner s right to use a gun in self defense in fact barack obama specifically voted four times in the illinois legislature to allow criminal charges against a homeowner who used a firearm in self defense of their person and home specifically what the supreme court says is a constitutional right _meta_end_dot_

 obama may say he supports it but his record says exactly the opposite _meta_end_dot_

 in _meta_number_ref_ the illinois senate considered s b _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ il _meta_number_ref_ sponsored by senator ed petka r plainfield _meta_end_dot_

 the bill came about because of an arrest in wilmette il in late december of _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 a _meta_number_ref_ year old businessman shot and wounded a man who had broken into his home for the second time in _meta_number_ref_ hours _meta_end_dot_

 cook county prosecutors found the shooting justified but the businessman mr _meta_end_dot_

 demar faced a fine and possible destruction of two guns under a _meta_number_ref_ village ordinance prohibiting handgun possession _meta_end_dot_

 s b _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ would allow residents to use self defense as a basis for seeking dismissal of criminal charges stemming from local gun ordinances if they used the banned weapon in an act of self defense in their home business or property _meta_end_dot_

 obama voted no on third reading march _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ and voted no on concurrence to a house amendment on may _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 in fact obama voted no four times in the judiciary committee on third reading in the judiciary committee s vote on concurrence with the house and on the final concurrence _meta_end_dot_

 luckily for the people of illinois the legislation passed despite obama s opposition _meta_end_dot_

 had he had his way people in illinois could still be prosecuted for defending themselves against crimes _meta_end_dot_

 and when he had other opportunities to affirm his belief that the _meta_number_ref_nd amendment was an individual right he fell short of the mark opting instead for restrictive legislation in _meta_number_ref_ obama voted in favor of s b _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ il _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 the legislation required guns to be secured by trigger locks placed in a lock box or placed in a location that a reasonable person would believe to be secure from a minor _meta_end_dot_

 likewise in _meta_number_ref_ obama voted for h b _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ il _meta_number_ref_ for a law that restricted the rights of illinois s citizens so that they could only buy one gun a month _meta_end_dot_

 the law created the offense of unlawful acquisition of handguns in _meta_number_ref_ obama voted against s b _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ il _meta_number_ref_ which would have allowed individuals who have valid orders of protection against other individuals to carry concealed weapons for their protection _meta_end_dot_

 the bill would have created an affirmative defense against a charge of violating illinois s concealed carry law if the person had a lawfully issued protection order against someone seeking to do harm to the person _meta_end_dot_

 in _meta_number_ref_ obama voted against s b _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ il _meta_number_ref_ which amended the firearms owners identification card act _meta_end_dot_

 the legislation was specifically crafted for sporting events and allowed a non resident participating in a sanctioned competitive shooting event in illinois to purchase a shotgun or shotgun ammunition in illinois but only at the site where the event is being held for the purpose of participating in the event _meta_end_dot_

 mr _meta_end_dot_

 obama is beginning to come across as the political reincarnation of john kerry _meta_end_dot_

 all joking aside and despite his claims to the contrary mr _meta_end_dot_

 obama is no friend of the _meta_number_ref_nd amendment or gun owners _meta_end_dot_
