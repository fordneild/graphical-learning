  over two hundred years ago a group of patriots wrote a declaration of independence to assert their freedom from an oppressive tyrant _meta_end_dot_

 our wonderful country was born _meta_end_dot_

 general george washington would become our first president at _meta_number_ref_ followed by _meta_number_ref_ men elected by the people to lead the last best hope for mankind _meta_end_dot_

 but that is not good enough for barack obama _meta_end_dot_

 no he wants you to declare your independence all over again _meta_end_dot_

 by donating to his campaign _meta_end_dot_

 according to his website his is the first presidential election truly funded by the people _meta_end_dot_

 here are the screenshots i visited barack obama s website today to see the new campaign ad _meta_end_dot_

 i was greeted with this crap instead _meta_end_dot_

 he even has a video to match it on the whole i d say that this entire decision by the obama campaign was made for the sole purpose of being able to rub it in john mccain s face _meta_end_dot_

 he said himself that he supports a robust system for the public financing of elections _meta_end_dot_

 he just wants to be able to point his finger and use the same old tired smears that democrats use every election that republicans are in the pockets of the wealthy of lobbyists of special interest groups and that it s really the democrats who work for you _meta_end_dot_

 the smear is nothing new _meta_end_dot_

 the tactics are and i just was in awe of the sheer arrogance of the obama campaign _meta_end_dot_

 it s such an insult to the declaration of independence the very document that this country was founded upon for barack obama to even think that he could equate his presidential campaign to it _meta_end_dot_

 and it s amazing to me that obama would be willing to do it for something so pathetic to spin his way out of breaking campaign pledges _meta_end_dot_

 i especially love the line the first presidential election truly funded by the people _meta_end_dot_

 in that sentence barack obama is smearing every single former president as illegitimate _meta_end_dot_

 amazing _meta_end_dot_

 it s as if obama is actually starting to believe the hype that he s starting to actually see himself as the obamamessiah _meta_end_dot_

 and i have to wonder does he really believe that every other president was not funded by the people _meta_end_question_

 does he really think that _meta_end_question_

 with that sentence he s painting even our founding fathers as swindlers and con artists who cheated the people to get the presidency and himself as the benevolent savior breaking away from that tradition _meta_end_dot_

 and while he is saying he wants you to declare your independence from a broken system while he smears our former presidents while he insults our declaration of independence _meta_end_dot_

 he claims to love this country unconditionally _meta_end_dot_

 incredible isn t it _meta_end_question_

 god save us if this man actually wins _meta_end_dot_
