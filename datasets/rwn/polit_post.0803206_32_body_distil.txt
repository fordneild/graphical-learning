  we just have to slow down our economy and cut back our greenhouse gas emissions cause we have to save the planet for our grandchildren bill clinton you know what they say the washington definition of a gaffe is accidentally telling the truth _meta_end_dot_

 and admitting that democrats will deliberately damage our economy in order to cater to al gore s fantasies about mankind causing the planet to warm up definitely qualifies _meta_end_dot_

 update _meta_number_ref_ after looking at what bill clinton said in more detail it s clear that jake tapper over at abc took his comments out of context and maybe america and europe and japan and canada the rich counties would say ok we just have to slow down our economy and cut back our greenhouse gas emissions cause we have to save the planet for our grandchildren we could do that _meta_end_dot_

 but if we did that you know as well as i do china and india and indonesia and vietnam and mexico and brazil and the ukraine and all the other countries will never agree to stay poor to save the planet for our grandchildren _meta_end_dot_

 it s unusual to see a liberal like tapper giving bill a taste of the treatment republicans normally get from the mainstream press _meta_end_dot_

 maybe he s an obama supporter _meta_end_dot_
