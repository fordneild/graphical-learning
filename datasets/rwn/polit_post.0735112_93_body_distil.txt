  it wasn t that long ago that people were pointing out that drudge and hillary seemed to be thick as thieves _meta_end_dot_

 for example in the new york times they wrote mrs _meta_end_dot_

 clinton is learning to play nice with the drudge report and the powerful elusive and conservative leaning man behind it _meta_end_dot_

 though liberals say the site s ideological imbalance remains plain republicans who viewed the site as theirs in campaigns past say they are noticing what they believe to be more democratic driven often clinton driven items on it _meta_end_dot_

 and as new york magazine reported recently mr _meta_end_dot_

 drudge sometimes mentioned mrs _meta_end_dot_

 clinton favorably on his syndicated radio program even if no one really knows whether his comments reflected admiration or simply a recognition that keeping her in the news is good for his business _meta_end_dot_

 at the same time democrats said they noticed an occasional clinton friendly tone from mr _meta_end_dot_

 drudge whom new york magazine quoted as saying on his program i need hillary clinton _meta_end_dot_

 you don t get it _meta_end_dot_

 i need to be part of her world _meta_end_dot_

 that s my bank well with hillary looking a little less inevitable drudge seems to be a little less concerned about biting the hand of his bank just look at this pic which is currently headlining the drudge report wow _meta_end_dot_

 i think the botox has worn off _meta_end_dot_

 but the amazing thing isn t that hillary looks like that it s that drudge is drawing so much attention to hillary ah i don t want to be uncharitable here let s just say hillary is looking very very old _meta_end_dot_
