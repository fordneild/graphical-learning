  as most of you have probably heard the _meta_number_ref_ republican in the senate trent lott has decided to call it a career and retire before the end of _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 since lott was just reelected in _meta_number_ref_ my first thought after hearing that lott resigned was that either he was ill or caught up in a major scandal that would be hitting the news shortly _meta_end_dot_

 however i m not hearing any bad news about lott s health or at least so far any big scandals that he s supposed to be involved in _meta_end_dot_

 there is a gay rumor that has popped up but it looks to have already been thoroughly debunked by the huffington post of all places _meta_end_dot_

 so why is lott resigning _meta_end_question_

 well supposedly he was lukewarm about running for office in _meta_number_ref_ and it s worth noting that some new ethics rules go into effect next year that would keep retiring members of congress from lobbying each other for two years _meta_end_dot_

 that means by quitting this month lott can start collecting a huge paycheck as a lobbyist next year instead of having to wait _meta_end_dot_

 if he needs money which is possible because he apparently lost his house in katrina he may feel like he needs to make a move now _meta_end_dot_

 of course since lott is leaving that means his seat will be up for grabs in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 the good news is that you d have to think that the gop is likely to hold onto a seat in mississippi _meta_end_dot_

 the bad news is that there are already a lot of open seats that the gop will have to defend in a year when the political environment isn t particularly favorable and the party is going through a cash crunch _meta_end_dot_

 the rumor is that congressman chip pickering will get the nod to replace lott and that he ll use that as a springboard to run for the seat in _meta_number_ref_ but it s still too early to know for sure _meta_end_dot_

 the other area where this will have an impact is with the gop leadership in the senate _meta_end_dot_

 to get a better idea of how this may play out i talked to a highly placed senate aide who agreed to speak to me on the condition that i report his comments anonymously _meta_end_dot_

 here s an edited transcript of our conversation on how the leadership races may play out _meta_end_dot_

 hawkins heard anything about the leadership races _meta_end_question_

 anonymous i think it shakes out like this jon kyl to whip _meta_end_dot_

 kay bailey hutchinson to conference chair _meta_end_dot_

 john cornyn to policy chair and then richard burr to vice chair but it is very fluid _meta_end_dot_

 regarding my guess of burr going to vice chair it needs to be noted that he is running against kay bailey hutchinson for conference chair _meta_end_dot_

 he could possibly win that seat but it would be an upset _meta_end_dot_

 i am guessing that he may drop his bid for that seat if he sees that kay bailey hutchinson has enough support _meta_end_dot_

 then he might go to vice chair _meta_end_dot_

 if he doesn t declare for vice chair then there is a movement afoot to draft jeff sessions _meta_end_dot_

 hawkins sessions would be awesome _meta_end_dot_

 anonymous one caveat to all of this it is hard to convince conservatives like sessions demint coburn etc to run for leadership because leadership traditionally constrains folks like that rather than empowering them _meta_end_dot_

 hawkins could sessions win _meta_end_question_

 anonymous yes sessions could win for vice chair _meta_end_dot_

 hawkins no lamar alexander running for anything _meta_end_question_

 anonymous no he has no base of support and kyl has whip locked up _meta_end_dot_

 hawkins i am a little surprised to hear that since alexander came within a whisker of beating lott for whip _meta_end_dot_

 anonymous yeah but his base of support was more anti lott than it was pro lamar _meta_end_dot_

 i just think his supporters were cobbled together from friends and people who couldn t stand the thought of elevating lott _meta_end_dot_

 hawkins i am happy lott s leaving as long as we hold his seat _meta_end_dot_

 anonymous yeah i hope this ends up being an upgrade all around _meta_end_dot_
