  via the associated press the university of texas medical branch may stop offering cancer care to indigent and undocumented immigrants in order to cut costs _meta_end_dot_

 the utmb set aside about _meta_dollor_ref_ million in this year s _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ billion annual budget to treat indigent cancer patients but that isn t enough to meet demand said karen sexton vice president and ceo of hospitals and clinics at the medical branch _meta_end_dot_

 the medical branch laid off _meta_number_ref_ employees last year as it dealt with inflation state funding cuts and the growing number of texans without health insurance _meta_end_dot_

 its cancer patients acceptance committee has been studying the issue of turning away undocumented immigrants to alleviate some of the financial pressure but the possibility raises obvious ethical questions sexton said _meta_end_dot_

 nobody whether they re here legally or not whether they have the money to pay for it out of pocket or not should be denied emergency care _meta_end_dot_

 we re not going to let people die in the street in this country because they don t have medical insurance or deep pockets _meta_end_dot_

 however american hospitals have no more of an ethical obligation to give longer term care to illegals than hospitals in other countries have an obligation to give long term care to the people reading right wing news in the states right now _meta_end_dot_

 if you re an illegal alien and you need long term cancer care you should either have to pay for it or you should go back to your home country to get it _meta_end_dot_

 we may be a rich country but we don t have unlimited resources _meta_end_dot_

 in this case americans are actually losing their jobs because all the bills can t be paid and there is a limited amount of money to care for indigent people both legal and illegal _meta_end_dot_

 since that s the case it s pretty clear that if someone has to lose it should be the illegal aliens since they re not supposed to be in this country in the first place _meta_end_dot_
