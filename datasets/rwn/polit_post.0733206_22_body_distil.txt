  this thread at the democratic underground poll question do you believe george w _meta_end_dot_

 bush was elected in _meta_number_ref_ and re elected in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_question_

 is a real eye catcher _meta_end_dot_

 take a look at these poll results what this shows is how the conspiracy theorists have taken over the left lock stock and barrel because the stolen election pap in _meta_number_ref_ and _meta_number_ref_ is only marginally less kooky than the _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ conspiracy theories that libs seem to love so much _meta_end_dot_

 let s take a quick look at the _meta_number_ref_ election first _meta_end_dot_

 here s an excerpt from my column the two year old s tantrum that never ends _meta_end_dot_

 here s a question that the democrats never really answer how many times do the exact same ballots have to be recounted before the democrats will concede that bush won _meta_end_question_

 let s recap shall we _meta_end_question_

 bush won the first machine recount _meta_end_dot_

 bush won the _meta_number_ref_nd machine recount _meta_end_dot_

 bush won when the absentee votes were added in _meta_end_dot_

 incidentally this should have been the end of it according to florida law written before the election _meta_end_dot_

 bush won the recount mandated by the florida state supreme court that was ruled unconstitutional by the ussc _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 the ussc then ruled another fssc recount unconstitutional _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ and stopped any further recounts via a _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ vote _meta_end_dot_

 bush won the recount after the election done by the miami herald _meta_end_dot_

 here s a headline and the first paragraph _meta_end_dot_

 review shows ballots say bush republican george w _meta_end_dot_

 bush s victory in florida which gave him the white house almost certainly would have endured even if a recount stopped by the u s _meta_end_dot_

 supreme court had been allowed to go forward bush also won a _meta_number_ref_nd recount done after the election by eight media groups _meta_end_dot_

 here s what the new york times certainly not a bush supporting paper had to say about that _meta_end_dot_

 i am quoting the headline and the first paragraph _meta_end_dot_

 study of disputed florida ballots finds justices did not cast the deciding vote a comprehensive review of the uncounted florida ballots from last year s presidential election reveals that george w _meta_end_dot_

 bush would have won even if the united states supreme court had allowed the statewide manual recount of the votes that the florida supreme court had ordered to go forward so by almost any objective standard bush won the election _meta_end_dot_

 then there s the _meta_number_ref_ election where the accusations of fraud are even more bizarre _meta_end_dot_

 i mean it s understandable that the result in florida was so controversial because bush only won by a few hundred votes _meta_end_dot_

 however in _meta_number_ref_ bush won the key state of ohio by _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ votes _meta_end_dot_

 to even make a victory of that size controversial requires an extremely active imagination _meta_end_dot_

 on top of all that the very fact that the democrats did so well in _meta_number_ref_ completely undercuts the idea that the _meta_number_ref_ and _meta_number_ref_ elections were fixed _meta_end_dot_

 that s because if the gop did have control of the ballot box given how many races there were polling as toss ups in _meta_number_ref_ they could have easily retained control of the house and senate by shifting around _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ or _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ votes nationally without anyone being the wiser _meta_end_dot_

 so that undercuts any major fraud allegations in previous elections yet _meta_percent_ref_ of the libs at the democratic underground think the last two presidential elections were fixed and this view has become so prevalent on the left that even democratic politicians who know better don t have the guts to admit that it s all a bunch of hooey _meta_end_dot_

 it just doesn t say much for the reasoning skills of the average liberal in this country _meta_end_dot_
