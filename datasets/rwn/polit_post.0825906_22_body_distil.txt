  anyone out there still thinking four years of the democrats to teach america a lesson _meta_end_question_

 i m sure no one but me missed the dustup over photographer jill greenberg s unprofessional behavior in her purported role as photojournalist _meta_end_dot_

 it s so embarrassing even the center left atlantic is embarrassed via insty by her antics _meta_end_dot_

 here s the thing _meta_end_dot_

 dirty tricks are one thing _meta_end_dot_

 all is fair in love and war _meta_end_dot_

 it s part of the fun _meta_end_dot_

 but read what this woman did according to the new york post greenberg later decided to use some of the images she was assigned to take to make a political statement _meta_end_dot_

 her web site now features a series of photoshopped pics of mccain in some highly unflattering poses including one that has a monkey squirting dung onto the republican candidate s head _meta_end_dot_

 another one reads i am a bloodthirsty warmongerer with mccain retouched to have needle sharp shark teeth and a vicious grin while licking blood smeared lips this is not a political statement unless you firmly believe that a four year old is capable of a political statement _meta_end_dot_

 juvenile yes and much more _meta_end_dot_

 jill greenberg has what they call in her neighborhood serious issues involving doo doo and then some _meta_end_dot_

 the problem is she is not alone _meta_end_dot_

 she is not embarrassed among her set you can be sure she is being toasted tonight for speaking truth to power the eternal lefty lie implying that there is actually some kind of risk in being a harsh critic of a national politician in this country _meta_end_dot_

 and while i know this piece will generate gutless anonymous comments here or on my own blog about how republicans can dish it out but they can t take it it s simply not true just for the saying it _meta_end_dot_

 first of all it s irrelevant what we can take because this sort of thing does no harm to the candidate at all _meta_end_dot_

 the point is that no actual conservative journalist would ever stoop to this not because it is particularly tasteless or particularly harsh or unfair criticism _meta_end_dot_

 for that we have anne coulter _meta_end_dot_

 in fact it s none of those things _meta_end_dot_

 no this kind of stuff what s troubling is that on the left it s not that unusual but _meta_end_dot_

 well it s _meta_end_dot_

 mental _meta_end_dot_

 and remember they say we re the ones with the problems _meta_end_dot_

 ron coleman s pretty good blog is likelihood of success _meta_end_dot_
