  in case any new jersey residents were thinking that the selling of our state roads for quick cash had died after public opposition i m afraid it s wishful thinking _meta_end_dot_

 the state s beloved governor corzine has made it apparent that he will stop at nothing to squeeze his own constituency for all we re worth whether it be by charging us for water for working for dying or for driving _meta_end_dot_

 and now his latest contemplation is over whether drivers could be offered to pay a price for the right to use express lanes in order to escape traffic _meta_end_dot_

 just in case gas prices weren t putting enough of a burden on our commutes _meta_end_dot_

 gov _meta_end_dot_

 jon corzine said today a proposal to let private investors operate some lanes along the new jersey turnpike is worthy of examination but represents just one of many ideas he s looking into while developing a new long range strategy for improving the state s roads and bridges _meta_end_dot_

 we need to have a comprehensive approach corzine said during a press conference in perth amboy _meta_end_dot_

 the single leasing of a lane will maybe deal with a widening but there might be other ways to do that one option would be to have lanes exclusively for truck and bus traffic _meta_end_dot_

 another would create express lanes for drivers who pay a premium to escape traffic _meta_end_dot_

 i m all for cost effective solutions to new jersey s debt and our traffic problem but does anyone actually think it is a good idea to drop a few billion dollars at once into the greedy unaccountable hands of the new jersey government _meta_end_question_

 or to put a price on yet another privilege that should cost residents nothing simply because the government does not want to take responsibility to address a problem _meta_end_question_

 for someone who had such monumental success in the private sector corzine has been a shocking disappointment when it comes to understanding and managing the public sector _meta_end_dot_

 even my ultra liberal colleague who was quick to alert me of this news calls this idea a regression back to the caste system where only the elite are good enough to enjoy the right not to sit in traffic _meta_end_dot_

 i don t like to say this to him often but he does have a point _meta_end_dot_
