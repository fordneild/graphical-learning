  yesterday i had an opportunity to talk to rnc chairman mike duncan and i asked him about an argument that has been made many times in the blogosphere especially since john mccain became our nominee _meta_end_dot_

 that question and mike duncan s answer which i thought was very good follows here s an argument that i don t agree with but that i hear a lot it goes something like this the gop is doing a poor job of representing conservatives _meta_end_dot_

 so what we need to do is deliberately lose in _meta_number_ref_ and then after a few years of hillary or barack in charge america will be sick of the left the gop will be serious about conservative principles again and the party will come back stronger than ever and more representative of conservative views again i don t agree with that but i hear it a lot _meta_end_dot_

 what do you say to that _meta_end_question_

 well that is a fallacious argument _meta_end_dot_

 it s also dangerous and let me paint a picture of why _meta_end_dot_

 taken to the extreme that would return us to _meta_number_ref_ when the democrats controlled the government entirely _meta_end_dot_

 look at all the programs that were introduced during that period of time that we ve had trouble managing that were are expensive that have caused us to raise taxes _meta_end_dot_

 so i think if people sit down and think about turning the entire government over to the democrats and what that would do to them individually it would take money away from their families take jobs away from small businesses and i think it would be disastrous for our economy _meta_end_dot_

 that would be a nightmare in my estimation _meta_end_dot_
