 in the weeks leading up to the pennsylvania primary obama aired a campaign spot in indiana and pennsylvania that sought to reinforce his theme that he would change the washington culture while also tapping into voter distress about the high price of gasoline _meta_end_dot_

 in the ad he called for a windfall profits penalty since the gas lines of the _meta_number_ref_s democrats and republicans have talked about energy independence but nothing s changed except now exxon s making _meta_dollor_ref_ billion a year and we re paying _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ for gas _meta_end_dot_

 i m barack obama _meta_end_dot_

 i don t take money from oil companies or washington lobbyists and i won t let them block change anymore says the spot which aired as recently as april _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 obama s ad is factually correct _meta_end_dot_

 did he lie _meta_end_question_

 well did bill clinton lie when he said i did not have sexual relations with that woman many democrats would argue that he didn t just as they d argue that obama s not lying now _meta_end_dot_

 now you could argue about that but let s not split hairs _meta_end_dot_

 even if you don t agree that obama is lying he s pretty clearly attempting to deliberately deceive people about the support he s getting from oil companies _meta_end_dot_

 and if he s willing to so blatantly mislead people about that how many other things is he going to mislead the american people about _meta_end_question_

 the list is only going to get longer and longer as he draws more scrutiny _meta_end_dot_
