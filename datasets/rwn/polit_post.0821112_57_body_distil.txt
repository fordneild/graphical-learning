  back in _meta_number_ref_ when the democrats were running a candidate who had served in vietnam against george bush who had only served in the national guard we were endlessly told how important it was to have a president who had actually served in the military and no serving in the national guard didn t count to the left _meta_end_dot_

 however now that the republicans have a candidate who has served in the military and the democrats are running a man who by their own definition is _meta_number_ref_ times more of a chickenhawk than george bush has ever been suddenly military service is actually a negative _meta_end_dot_

 take a look at excerpts from this daily kos diary by wee mama and you will see what i mean one aspect of mccain s presidency that i have not seen addressed is the precise form of his military experience _meta_end_dot_

 we have had good presidents with military experience eisenhower and carter come to mind as well as good ones without it fdr and clinton to name two _meta_end_dot_

 but military experience is not all equal _meta_end_dot_

 slogging through the mud is not the same as calibrating a nuclear submarine _meta_end_dot_

 and of all the possible military experiences that of bomber pilot to me is most suspect _meta_end_dot_

 it can be argued whether bomber pilots are needed at all _meta_end_dot_

 certainly some of their runs such as the dresden firestorm are now seen as war crimes _meta_end_dot_

 but let us grant for the purpose of the arguement that there are limited appropriate uses for bombers in a just war _meta_end_dot_

 how does being a bomber pilot shape the person who experiences it _meta_end_question_

 of all forms of warfare bombing is the most ethereal the most detached from the human carnage and suffering it causes _meta_end_dot_

 down below on the ground children are bleeding mothers are crying fathers are scattered in small pieces and towns burn _meta_end_dot_

 above in the heavens the pilot sees only flowers of fire bloom in precise rows elegant punctuated lines of clouds of dust _meta_end_dot_

 bombing is of all forms of warfare the one least suited to teaching the true consequences of actions _meta_end_dot_

 i don t want a bomber pilot for a president _meta_end_dot_

 so there you go _meta_end_dot_

 if you re an american bomber pilot you may be guilty of war crimes probably aren t needed at all and certainly aren t fit to be president _meta_end_dot_

 that tells you a lot about how the kossacks view the military _meta_end_dot_
