  question what boston celtics player was the first nba player to shatter a backboard by hanging onto the rim and in what year _meta_end_question_

 posted by lord_locksley answer like i care about the celtics _meta_end_dot_

 puhleeze _meta_end_exclamation_

 i m only enduring them in _meta_number_ref_ out of my disgust with kobe bryant _meta_end_dot_

 however this answer was found easily enough because i didn t actually know the answer _meta_end_dot_

 so here amongst other celtics lovers is the answer the first shattered backboard in pro basketball was destroyed in the boston celtics debut game in _meta_number_ref_ at boston arena now matthews arena _meta_end_dot_

 it was smashed by kevin connors of the celtics _meta_end_dot_
