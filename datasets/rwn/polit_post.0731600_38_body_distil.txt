  science faces discrimination these days _meta_end_dot_

 that is the scientists daring to publish ideas supported by research but not conforming to political correctness is discriminated against _meta_end_dot_

 if the science doesn t bend to preconceived notions or is somehow uncomfortable scientists and other thinkers simply ignore it or worse demean it _meta_end_dot_

 the academic environment has become so politically charged searching for truth is a secondary goal to making sure that the results are politically correct _meta_end_dot_

 the latest dust up is over dna _meta_end_dot_

 dna has been mapped now and as it is further dissected some difficult facts have been revealed though few of the bits of human genetic code that vary between individuals have yet to be tied to physical or behavioral traits scientists have found that roughly _meta_number_ref_ percent of them are more common in certain continental groups and can be used to distinguish people of different races _meta_end_dot_

 they say that studying the differences which arose during the tens of thousands of years that human populations evolved on separate continents after their ancestors dispersed from humanity s birthplace in east africa is crucial to mapping the genetic basis for disease _meta_end_dot_

 but many geneticists wary of fueling discrimination and worried that speaking openly about race could endanger support for their research are loath to discuss the social implications of their findings _meta_end_dot_

 still some acknowledge that as their data and methods are extended to nonmedical traits the field is at what one leading researcher recently called a very delicate time and a dangerous time emphasis added my concern isn t that science might come up with difficult facts _meta_end_dot_

 my concern is that science will come up with difficult facts and refuse to share them _meta_end_dot_

 in an area that should be devoid of ideology and focused on pursuing the truth withholding data has serious implications for the expansion of knowledge _meta_end_dot_

 who gets to decide what the little people are capable of handling _meta_end_question_

 and what will the process be to decide this _meta_end_question_

 and worse it is disturbing that scientists would ignore valid fields of research because they fear losing livelihood or respect in the field _meta_end_dot_
