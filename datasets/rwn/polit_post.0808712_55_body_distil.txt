  over at slate anne applebaum has a column that suggests that the u s _meta_end_dot_

 boycott beijing now i think the chinese are monsters who enslave their own people are a negative influence around the world that it was a huge mistake to reward them with an olympics in the first place and that what they re doing to tibet among other things is absolutely wrong _meta_end_dot_

 however what would we really accomplish by boycotting the olympics _meta_end_question_

 if there was some tangible benefit that we could reap from boycotting the olympics for example freeing tibet keeping the chinese from oppressing their own people keeping them from threatening taiwan etc _meta_end_dot_

 i d say go for it _meta_end_dot_

 but all we d really end up doing is punishing our own athletes _meta_end_dot_

 so why should we tell our own athletes that they re going to have to flush four years of work down the drain because the idiots in charge of the olympics committee looked at one of the worst bad actors on the planet shrugged their shoulders and decided to give them the olympics anyway _meta_end_question_

 simple answer we shouldn t _meta_end_dot_
