  t he russian invasion of georgia is more than just a military action it is a statement to the world that russia is back and seeking to regain its superpower status _meta_end_dot_

 in a carefully chosen military action it is essentially thumbing its nose at the west and especially nato _meta_end_dot_

 i say carefully chosen because unlike the ukraine for instance there is very little if anything we can do of any immediacy to help georgia right now _meta_end_dot_

 mounting any sort of military operation would be extremely difficult without the ability to support them from say turkey or armenia if we re talking about ground and airforces _meta_end_dot_

 getting the permission to do that is very unlikely _meta_end_dot_

 that leaves the sea and the same sorts of difficulties _meta_end_dot_

 again permission to pushing a fleet through narrows of the dardanelles is not likely _meta_end_dot_

 it would also be of limited military value _meta_end_dot_

 and then we d face a russian black sea fleet _meta_end_dot_

 rumors of an amphibious landing on the western coast of georgia seem unlikely _meta_end_dot_

 it doesn t appear an operation like that will be necessary _meta_end_dot_

 russian troops have pushed through south ossetia into the georgian town of gori effectively cutting the country in half _meta_end_dot_

 tblisi is isolated to the east _meta_end_dot_

 the other breakaway province of abkhazia in nw georgia is also effectively in russian hands _meta_end_dot_

 while georgia pretty much brought this about by invading south ossetia friday it is obvious by the quick reaction that russia anticipated the move and was more than prepared to counter it _meta_end_dot_

 and their counter attack was an overwhelming attack with a purpose _meta_end_dot_

 it is also obvious that the plan involved going beyond what most observers consider to be the logical stopping point if the purpose was only to repel the georgian attack into south ossetia _meta_end_dot_

 russia it would seem is making a statement _meta_end_dot_

 one part of the statement has to do with nato and the reality not the promise of the protection it does offer to those former warsaw pact nations and new nations which were formed when the ussr disintegrated _meta_end_dot_

 or said another way it is demonstrating what nato is and isn t willing to go to war over and it seems russia has a very good handle on that _meta_end_dot_

 nato isn t going to go to war over georgia _meta_end_dot_

 nor is the us _meta_end_dot_

 of course that s not what georgia expected _meta_end_dot_

 as a russian jet bombed fields around his village djimali avago a georgian farmer asked me why won t america and nato help us _meta_end_question_

 if they won t help us now why did we help them in iraq a similar sense of betrayal coursed through the conversations of many georgians here yesterday as their troops retreated under shellfire and the russian army pressed forward to take full control of south ossetia _meta_end_dot_

 of course the expectations of georgians are pretty unrealistic _meta_end_dot_

 a it was georgia who started the conflict nato is a defensive organization which is under no obligation to back aggression by one of its members and georgia isn t yet a member _meta_end_dot_

 b it is obvious georgia completely miscalculated the russian response _meta_end_dot_

 and c by the time nato or the us could actually respond in force the conflict will be over _meta_end_dot_

 so back to russia if part of their action is to demonstrate the impotence of nato to the new nations formed out of the old ussr what else is it trying to say _meta_end_question_

 i think it is saying it is no longer the shambling bumbling toothless bear of the recent past _meta_end_dot_

 it is demonstrating in a very visible way that it can and will again project power at least militarily within its region and do it both swiftly and decisively _meta_end_dot_

 if you don t think the ukraine and other bordering nations aren t paying attention you re wrong _meta_end_dot_

 this will at a minimum indeed change the balance of power within the region _meta_end_dot_

 while russia is nowhere near the power it once was it is no longer an impotent state either and it has just served warning that it will no longer stand idly by and allow what it considers to be assaults on its sovereignty to go unanswered _meta_end_dot_

 how does that relate to us and what is going on in georgia _meta_end_question_

 well regardless of how resurgent the russian military is it still can t stand up to ours and they know it _meta_end_dot_

 so they will pick their battles carefully until they feel they re capable of doing so if necessary _meta_end_dot_

 georgia is perfect example of that _meta_end_dot_

 they know perfectly well that neither nato or the us can really do much militarily to aid the georgians _meta_end_dot_

 russia has a _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ million man military georgia has about _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 the time and basing factors preclude any meaningful intervention on our part _meta_end_dot_

 about all we can do is put intense diplomatic pressure on them to stop the invasion and withdraw _meta_end_dot_

 endgame _meta_end_question_

 most likely they get south ossetia and perhaps abkhazia out of the deal _meta_end_dot_

 i say get meaning they will exercise control over what will become autonomous regions a bit of payback over kosovo whose independence the russians opposed _meta_end_dot_

 georgia will regain its sovereignty but at the price of those two areas and with the understanding that russia holds the mortgage on it and will foreclose at the slightest provocation and there isn t much the west or nato is willing or able to do about it _meta_end_dot_
