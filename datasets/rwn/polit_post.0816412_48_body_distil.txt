  back in march i wrote about david motari the marine who very foolishly allowed himself to be videotaped throwing a puppy off a cliff in iraq _meta_end_dot_

 there was a lot of debate on whether or not the puppy was alive or not _meta_end_dot_

 i came down on the fake side my verdict _meta_end_question_

 i m leaning towards fake _meta_end_dot_

 by fake i mean that i don t think that it s a live puppy being thrown _meta_end_dot_

 i have watched it several times and there are a few things that stick out although that question hasn t been definitively answered the latest actions by the marines suggest that the puppy was alive the us marine corps is expelling one soldier and disciplining another for their roles in a video showing a lance corporal throwing a puppy off a cliff while on patrol in iraq _meta_end_dot_

 the _meta_number_ref_ second video posted on youtube drew furious condemnation from animal rights groups when it came to light in march _meta_end_dot_

 the clip shows two marines joking before one hurls the puppy into a gully _meta_end_dot_

 yelping is heard as it flips through the air _meta_end_dot_

 marine corps base hawaii said today that lance cpl david motari received unspecified non judicial punishment and is being processed for separation from the marine corps _meta_end_dot_

 the second marine sgt crismarvin banez encarnacion also received unspecified non judicial punishment _meta_end_dot_

 just a word of advice to boneheads like david motari if you re thinking about doing something immoral or illegal don t do it _meta_end_dot_

 however if you are going to do it don t take pics or video of it _meta_end_dot_

 you d think that this would be a pretty simple concept but judging by this idiot and the morons at abu ghraib apparently not _meta_end_dot_

 personally if it only affected the people doing these mindblowingly stupid things i d say videotape until your heart s content but unfortunately the left uses incidents like these to smear the troops _meta_end_dot_

 so every david motari and lyndie england ends up getting treated like the rule amongst our soldiers instead of the warped exceptions _meta_end_dot_

 even if guys like motari don t have the common sense morals or instinct for preservation necessary to keep from committing and documenting themselves doing dumb things they should at least have enough respect for the people they re serving with to avoid doing things that might reflect badly upon them _meta_end_dot_
