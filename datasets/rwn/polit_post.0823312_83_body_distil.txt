  if you re barack obama you ve got to be starting to sweat _meta_end_dot_

 according to reuters zogby john mccain has gone from _meta_number_ref_ points behind you last month to _meta_number_ref_ points ahead of you with likely voters _meta_end_dot_

 worse yet you re at _meta_percent_ref_ in the polls which may even be worse than it looks because of the bradley effect _meta_end_dot_

 the news probably isn t going to get better anytime soon either _meta_end_dot_

 mccain is striking home with negative ads portraying you as a celebrity he just ran over you like a truck at the saddleback forums and not only is the gop convention running after the democratic convention the debates are still coming up and you re not too anxious to go toe to toe with mccain _meta_end_dot_

 still it s not as if you re out of this thing _meta_end_dot_

 you ve going to have a significant cash advantage over mccain the press loves you and the enthusiasm level of your supporters dwarfs that of the republicans _meta_end_dot_

 so how do you get back on track _meta_end_question_

 with making some sharp moves that can turn this election back in your favor _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ select hillary clinton as your vice president to reunite the democratic party and start publicly inviting seasoned old hands to join your administration if you win a little humbleness would be helpful here given your reputation for arrogance _meta_end_dot_

 publicly getting men like colin powell sam nunn joe biden john kerry to say that they would join your cabinet would certainly make the public breathe a little easier about putting you in the white house _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ one of the core parts of your appeal was supposed to be racial reconciliation _meta_end_dot_

 you were going to be the candidate to put race in the country s rear view mirror _meta_end_dot_

 so live up to that promise and say that you now oppose affirmative action and would like to see the policy ended when you become president _meta_end_dot_

 there s nothing that would do more to reassure the public that you mean what you say about uniting the public than getting rid of that racist policy that seems to make less and less sense the longer it goes on _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ the war has turned back into a _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ issue and your attempts to portray john mccain as another bush aren t working on a guy who has a well earned reputation as a maverick so your attack ads against him are failing _meta_end_dot_

 instead what you should try to do is turn the election from a referendum on you into a referendum on the republican party _meta_end_dot_

 what the american people think of john mccain isn t the issue _meta_end_dot_

 instead what the american people need to think about when they go into that voting booth is do we want to reward the republican party with _meta_number_ref_ more years in the white house _meta_end_question_

 john mccain may be a fine fellow but if the american people put the gop back in charge aren t they saying keep it up for another _meta_number_ref_ years _meta_end_question_

 turn this election into a referendum on the republican party not on you and it will help your chances immeasurably _meta_end_dot_

 ps inevitably when i write posts like this i get people in the comments section going don t give them advice _meta_end_exclamation_

 what if they take it but what you have to understand is that by virtue of my being a conservative republican my advice is not just wrong but probably evil and part of some rovian plot to liberals _meta_end_dot_

 so they would never consider taking it even if they thought what i was saying made perfect sense _meta_end_dot_
