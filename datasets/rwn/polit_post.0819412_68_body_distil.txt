  we re seeing the third largest bank failure in united states history today with the seizure of indymac by federal regulators emphasis added indymac bank a prolific mortgage specialist that helped fuel the housing boom was seized friday by federal regulators in the third largest bank failure in u s _meta_end_dot_

 history _meta_end_dot_

 indymac is the biggest mortgage lender to go under since a fall in housing prices and surge in defaults began rippling through the economy last year and it likely won t be the last _meta_end_dot_

 banking regulators are bracing for a slew of failures over the next year as analysts say housing prices have yet to bottom out _meta_end_dot_

 the collapse is expected to cost the federal deposit insurance corp _meta_end_dot_

 between _meta_dollor_ref_ billion and _meta_dollor_ref_ billion potentially wiping out more than _meta_percent_ref_ of the fdic s _meta_dollor_ref_ billion deposit insurance fund _meta_end_dot_

 the pasadena calif thrift was one of the largest savings and loans in the country with about _meta_dollor_ref_ billion in assets _meta_end_dot_

 it now joins an infamous list of collapsed banks topped by continental illinois national bank trust co which failed in _meta_number_ref_ with _meta_dollor_ref_ billion of assets _meta_end_dot_

 the second largest failure was american savings loan association of stockton calif in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 the director of the office of thrift supervision john reich blamed indymac s failure on comments made in late june by sen _meta_end_dot_

 charles schumer d n y who sent a letter to the regulator raising concerns about the bank s solvency _meta_end_dot_

 in the following _meta_number_ref_ days spooked depositors withdrew a total of _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ billion _meta_end_dot_

 mr _meta_end_dot_

 reich said sen _meta_end_dot_

 schumer gave the bank a heart attack would the institution have failed without the deposit run mr _meta_end_dot_

 reich asked reporters _meta_end_dot_

 we ll never know the answer to that question i worked in banking for a few years _meta_end_dot_

 the fdic only insures up to _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 anyone with account balances higher than that are just going to have to eat the losses _meta_end_dot_

 but of course if they have a bank account balance of over _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ that makes them the rich and the rich is a group of evil greedy corporate stooges so i guess this isn t a tragedy is it _meta_end_question_

 maybe just maybe things like this could be avoided if the democrats would stop meddling with the free market _meta_end_dot_

 the more democrats try to interfere with our economy the more it crashes _meta_end_dot_

 and the more it crashes the more government intervention democrats think is necessary _meta_end_dot_

 and somehow americans keep voting chuck schumer co _meta_end_dot_

 into office _meta_end_dot_

 how much money can we afford to lose before we wise up _meta_end_question_

 hat tip hot air
