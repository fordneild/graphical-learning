  when it comes to dirty politics you have to go all the way back to tricky dick nixon to find someone as adept at as the clintons _meta_end_dot_

 for example take the obama cocaine flap _meta_end_dot_

 people are very mistaken to simply attribute this to some guy shooting off his mouth by mistake and the clinton campaign doing what they can to quiet him down _meta_end_dot_

 here s how it works _meta_end_dot_

 first of all you have bill shaheen national and new hampshire co chairman who comes out and says the following about obama did you ever give drugs to anyone _meta_end_question_

 did you sell them to anyone that s a day of press coverage for the completely unfounded allegation that barack obama may have been a drug dealer _meta_end_dot_

 the next day shaheen quits and clinton apologizes _meta_end_dot_

 however all the news stories have to explain why that happened _meta_end_dot_

 so there s day _meta_number_ref_ of coverage for the completely unfounded allegation that barack obama may have been a drug dealer _meta_end_dot_

 then we have a day of people criticizing shaheen and clinton for mentioning the story _meta_end_dot_

 there s day _meta_number_ref_ of the obama the coke dealer story floating around _meta_end_dot_

 but of course you can t forget the week end shows _meta_end_dot_

 mark penn hillary s chief strategist gets asked and again he mentions the allegation _meta_end_dot_

 so there s day _meta_number_ref_ of coverage for the completely unfounded allegation that barack obama may have been a drug dealer _meta_end_dot_

 next up we have a day for people to criticize penn for his comments _meta_end_dot_

 and we now have _meta_number_ref_ days of coverage of an allegation that appears to have no basis in fact _meta_end_dot_

 add in another day or two for columns blog posts and late news articles and you ve managed to keep a potentially damaging allegation out there for an entire week _meta_end_dot_

 this dramatically increases the number of voters who know that obama used cocaine and because a lot of people probably don t pay attention gives say _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_percent_ref_ of the population the false idea that obama dealt cocaine as well _meta_end_dot_

 why would shaheen agree to do this _meta_end_question_

 well today he gets fired but tomorrow once hillary s in power and this episode has for the most part gone down the memory hole there would probably be a plumb job available for him in return _meta_end_dot_

 the clintons always take care of people who are loyal to them _meta_end_dot_

 ask susan mcdougal and sandy berger about that _meta_end_dot_

 ps this is exactly the same tactic they used with the fake obama is a muslim stories that they got out there not just once but twice _meta_end_dot_

 ps _meta_number_ref_ note that the obama is really a muslim and a coke dealer stories play to stereotypes about black americans _meta_end_dot_

 so don t be surprised if another clinton employee accuses him of spending his time seducing innocent white women next _meta_end_dot_

 that seems to be about their speed _meta_end_dot_
