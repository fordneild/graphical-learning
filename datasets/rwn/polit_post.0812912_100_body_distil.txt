  over at usa today don campbell wrote a pretty good column called the wright story what took so long well it was good except for one thing the author didn t answer his own question barring some really strange math or a lot of second thoughts the democrats seem poised to nominate for president a man with the fewest credentials and least familiarity to the american people of anyone in modern history _meta_end_dot_

 it s just one more way that barack obama is breaking the mold and barring a major shift he should give some of the credit to the news media _meta_end_dot_

 the record shows that publications such as the chicago tribune newspaper and rolling stone magazine had detected the controversial nature of obama s church about the time he entered the presidential race in early _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 soon after the announcement speech moreover wright himself volunteered to the new york times that he had been disinvited to give the invocation at obama s presidential launch because of the baggage he would bring to the podium _meta_end_dot_

 that set off conservative bloggers and talkers but little or no follow up in the regular or so called mainstream news media _meta_end_dot_

 more than a year passed before abc news brian ross had the clever idea to purchase videos of wright s sermons to review them _meta_end_dot_

 the most incendiary clips quickly landed on youtube and the rest is history _meta_end_dot_

 the news media were dragged into the controversy holding their noses but by then obama had the goal line in sight _meta_end_dot_

 speculation aside obama has been ill served by a press corps that seemingly was mesmerized by the large frenzied crowds who turn out to see the democratic rock star _meta_end_dot_

 crowds can be deceiving mcgovern nobody s idea of a rock star attracted huge and exuberant crowds throughout the fall of _meta_number_ref_ on his way to losing _meta_number_ref_ states to richard nixon _meta_end_dot_

 more than two years ago at a gridiron club news media dinner in washington obama poked fun at his meager accomplishments when he told his audience i want to thank you for all the generous advance coverage you ve given me in anticipation of a successful career _meta_end_dot_

 when i actually do something we ll let you know but the joke was on the journalists then and now that obama is about to actually do something it still is _meta_end_dot_

 see _meta_end_question_

 there are a lot of great lines in there but no answer to the very obvious question what took so long well we could just as easily ask what took the press so long to cover the allegations by the swift boat veterans for truth back in _meta_number_ref_ after all the swifties formed before kerry captured the nomination and his anti war protesting wasn t exactly a secret _meta_end_dot_

 moreover the swift boat vets were veterans many of them had served with kerry they were credible moreso than kerry himself and they actually blew huge holes in some of kerry s stories _meta_end_dot_

 yet despite the fact that they were getting enormous coverage on talk radio and in the blogosphere the mainstream media almost completely ignored them until kerry responded to them publicly and then they simply aped the democratic line their allegations have been disproven without ever giving their arguments a serious looksie _meta_end_dot_

 another clue that may help answer don campbell s question was the huge outcry on the left after the abc debate where obama bombed when he had to actually answer some tough questions about jeremiah wright his refusal to wear a flag pin and his connections to terrorist william ayers _meta_end_dot_

 so why didn t the media hit obama on wright earlier _meta_end_question_

 why didn t they cover the swift boat vets for truth earlier _meta_end_question_

 why was there such a protest over barack obama being asked tough questions in a debate _meta_end_question_

 it s the same answer to every question the mainstream media is mostly comprised of liberals they do what they can to try to help their candidate win and they generally think it helps to give democrats a pass on tough issues _meta_end_dot_

 are they right _meta_end_question_

 i m not sure that they are especially in an age where the new media makes sure that these issues eventually come to people s attention _meta_end_dot_

 republicans are used to tough vetting and being treated unfairly by the media so when the hammer drops and eventually it almost always does even for liberals gop candidates are usually well prepared _meta_end_dot_

 that s often not the case for liberals _meta_end_dot_

 they often have weaknesses exposed late in the game and do a poor job of handling it because they re simply not used to getting really tough questions from the press _meta_end_dot_

 when the republicans were picking a candidate i was happy to see mitt s mormonism mccain s age huckabee s sermons and rudy s marital trysts getting attention because you can be sure that all of those things would be discussed ad nauseum during a long campaign _meta_end_dot_

 had the wright story broken earlier in the game hillary who is the stronger candidate of the two would probably now be in the catbird s seat instead of barack _meta_end_dot_

 maybe that won t make a difference in a year where the democrats have a wind at their back but if obama gets the nomination and goes down to defeat the msm s aborted attempt to protect him for so long will have a lot to do with it _meta_end_dot_
