  i had an instant messenger conversation with one of the many aides in congress that i know about the funk conservatives are in _meta_end_dot_

 here s an edited transcript of our conversation which i published with permission that you may find interesting _meta_end_dot_

 john hawkins the thing to keep in mind is though in my experience is that conservatives are so irritated and crabby now that pretty much anything other than get back to conservative principles aggravates them _meta_end_dot_

 they don t want strategy _meta_end_dot_

 they don t want new conservative principles _meta_end_dot_

 just get back to conservative principles _meta_end_exclamation_

 so unfortunately although that s not enough people don t respond well to new ideas right now _meta_end_dot_

 anything other than we need to get back to reagan s agenda makes people mad _meta_end_dot_

 random anon aide i have little hope for our party then if our people are that narrow minded _meta_end_dot_

 i love reagan but the reagan agenda is not going to save us _meta_end_dot_

 john hawkins it s because the trust factor is so low right now _meta_end_dot_

 it will just take time _meta_end_dot_

 random anon aide i hate when people ask for a new contract with america like that is going to save us _meta_end_dot_

 people forget newt was kicked out soon after _meta_end_dot_

 the next election we lost seats _meta_end_dot_

 john hawkins i think the big problem is that conservatives have zero trust in elected republicans _meta_end_dot_

 random anon aide yes i agree but none of the ideas we propose makes them happy _meta_end_dot_

 if we invoke reagan people say recycled ideas _meta_end_dot_

 if we move away from reagan they say where is reagan it s like a no win situation _meta_end_dot_

 john hawkins personally i think the key to it would be to have the party commit to something big on spending like a no earmarks pledge or a balanced budget amendment and a no amnesty pledge on illegal immigration along with a we ve changed message _meta_end_dot_

 random anon aide they have done all that kinda of _meta_end_dot_

 john hawkins they haven t _meta_end_dot_

 random anon aide we are working on a balanced budget pledge _meta_end_dot_

 john hawkins that is an excellent idea _meta_end_dot_

 random anon aide we tried the earmark moratorium _meta_end_dot_

 john hawkins mccain is pushing one _meta_end_dot_

 random anon aide yet many members are reluctant to sign on to a total moratorium including some of our fiscal conservatives like members of the rsc _meta_end_dot_

 john hawkins see that s a trust thing though _meta_end_dot_

 that s the republican party not doing what conservatives want _meta_end_dot_

 that s why they re not trusted _meta_end_dot_

 random anon aide i personally think people put too much focus on earmarks _meta_end_dot_

 there are some republicans who aren t going to stop giving earmarks so democrats can do it and then the democrats will be seen as the only ones helping districts _meta_end_dot_

 john hawkins i agree that there is too much emphasis on it but eventually it will be something counter intuitive like that gets conservatives back on board _meta_end_dot_

 random anon aide i am more into sunset provisions balanced budget and transparency _meta_end_dot_

 conservatives have to figure out what is important _meta_end_dot_

 if they want a smaller government taking out earmarks is not going to do it _meta_end_dot_

 we have to do much more _meta_end_dot_

 john hawkins immigration is a key to it too _meta_end_dot_

 the gop isn t getting conservatives back on board until they get right on illegal immigration _meta_end_dot_

 random anon aide members are talking about immigration john hawkins yeah but conservatives don t trust the party because of the way the senate acted during the comprehensive immigration fight and because mccain is the nominee _meta_end_dot_

 the house did a good job on it _meta_end_dot_

 they get no credit _meta_end_dot_

 random anon aide well honestly people have to stop just skimming through things and act like educated voters _meta_end_dot_

 i might not agree with parts of the immigration debate but at least the gop has made an effort to do something about the out of control chaos that is immigration _meta_end_dot_

 the dems have done nothing in a year and half _meta_end_dot_

 the house gop has tried to use maneuvers this year to get a bill on the floor and they were stopped by the dems _meta_end_dot_

 people give them no credit _meta_end_dot_

 at the end of the day republicans don t control congress democrats do _meta_end_dot_

 john hawkins the house is always in a bad spot _meta_end_dot_

 the house always gets ignored and people pay attention to the senate and the president which is too bad because they are always less conservative than the house _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 john hawkins i think we re losing probably _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ seats random anon aide i would say as much as _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 i say between _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 we have about _meta_number_ref_ open seats _meta_end_dot_

 john hawkins i think the only thing that will keep us from losing that many i hope is that they would have to win a lot of seats in districts that are heavily republican to do that _meta_end_dot_

 random anon aide but we have a lot of vulnerable incumbents as well money wins elections _meta_end_dot_

 even on the web we don t raise money for candidates _meta_end_dot_

 it is just plain sad _meta_end_dot_

 john hawkins well the base is sooooooooooo depressed right now it s just hard to do anything _meta_end_dot_

 conservatives are completely de motivated _meta_end_dot_

 random anon aide look believe me i know the house gop aren t god s gift _meta_end_dot_

 they are human and make alot of mistakes but they are trying hard to make things work _meta_end_dot_

 john hawkins i like our people in the house _meta_end_dot_

 you don t have to convince me d random anon aide and they are as frustrated as the american public _meta_end_dot_
