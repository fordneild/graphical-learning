  just because they were having a hissy fit yesterday face the nation jindal thinks intelligent design should be taught with evolution i try very hard to be tolerant of others beliefs _meta_end_dot_

 i don t pretend to have all the answers and i certainly don t want to begrudge others answers that work for them _meta_end_dot_

 here comes the tolerance however i draw the line at the whole false equivalence of the intelligent design evolution argument _meta_end_dot_

 in fact even though i recognize it goes against the constitution i m not sure that shouldn t be a test for elected office if you feel that the idea of intelligent design which can not be proven in any kind of scientific way should be taught alongside with evolution which is as much a theory as gravity is then you do not belong in a position where you can make that decision _meta_end_dot_

 yikes _meta_end_exclamation_

 whether one believes in darwinism creationism or id that s not the point _meta_end_dot_

 this is just another case of a liberal showing their intolerance to any other viewpoint then their own _meta_end_dot_

 i ll give c l commentor pawn props for asking for major abuse you know gravity is proven scientifically _meta_end_dot_

 evolution and intelligent design are really on the same level _meta_end_dot_

 neither is proven nor is there a realistic way to prove either _meta_end_dot_

 just because evolution has been a long standing theory intelligent design has been around thousands of years longer _meta_end_dot_

 what makes evolution so much more palatable than intelligent design _meta_end_question_

 it comes down to your beliefs and what you determine to be right _meta_end_dot_

 i don t like jindal or the mixture of religion and politics but similar to the last post on jindal s exorcism comments we have to really focus on what he is doing politically not religiously _meta_end_dot_

 let s not let ourselves fall into the republican attempts to make this election about religion _meta_end_exclamation_

 except for the part about about hating jindal and the last sentence i agree _meta_end_dot_

 all _meta_number_ref_ are primarily about belief but i am going to stop there _meta_end_dot_

 i don t want to make this about the hypotheses just about silly liberal intolerance _meta_end_dot_

 ps i wonder if c l will complain to john the way nancy p _meta_end_dot_

 does to bush when cheney is mean
