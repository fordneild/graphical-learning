  the associated press dug back through their archives and found some answers huckabee gave to a questionnaire they sent him when he was seeking a seat in the house in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 he said some pretty controversial things about the aids issue it turns out _meta_end_dot_

 here s the three key quotes if the federal government is truly serious about doing something with the aids virus we need to take steps that would isolate the carriers of this plague i feel homosexuality is an aberrant unnatural and sinful lifestyle and we now know it can pose a dangerous public health risk in light of the extraordinary funds already being given for aids research it does not seem that additional federal spending can be justified _meta_end_dot_

 an alternative would be to request that multimillionaire celebrities such as elizabeth taylor madonna and others who are pushing for more aids funding be encouraged to give out of their own personal treasuries increased amounts for aids research i personally don t feel that homosexuality is all that aberrant or sinful as long as the participants in a sexual relationship are all consenting adults i don t really have a problem with it _meta_end_dot_

 i also think that huckabee is right in his statement about funding for aids research _meta_end_dot_

 to be blunt aids is a behavioral disease _meta_end_dot_

 if you don t have promiscuous sex and you don t use intravenous drugs your chances of getting the disease drop to near zero _meta_end_dot_

 given the number of diseases out there that afflict people regardless of their lifestyle choices i m not sure why the taxpayers should foot the bill for aids research when that money could be better spent researching other diseases _meta_end_dot_

 but the real problem here is huckabee s support for quarantining aids patients _meta_end_dot_

 not only would that be a fantastically egregious violation of individual liberty it is also completely unnecessary given that aids is again a behavioral disease _meta_end_dot_

 if you re not out having sex with strangers all the time and you re not sharing needles you won t get it _meta_end_dot_

 there are instances of course of people who know they have aids actually trying to give it to other people but we re already putting the people responsible for that sort of thing in jail _meta_end_dot_

 so huckabee couldn t be more wrong on that point though i m not surprised that a big government nanny stater like him would support that kind of solution _meta_end_dot_

 does this hurt huck in the primaries though _meta_end_question_

 we ll see but most of huck s support is coming from the evangelicals who aren t likely to be phased by this sort of thing _meta_end_dot_

 if anything this is going to galvanize dislike for him among the more fiscally conservative elements of the gop but they already disliked him _meta_end_dot_
