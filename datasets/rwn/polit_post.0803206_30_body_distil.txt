  admittedly the title is a wee bit of an exaggeration _meta_end_dot_

 did i say wee bit i really meant a huge exaggeration _meta_end_dot_

 okay okay the title is so over the top that i would only write it in a column not say it in front of an audience of conservatives because people might start throwing garbage _meta_end_dot_

 and let me tell you i understand where people are coming from with mccain i really do _meta_end_dot_

 that s why i created such seminal works of art as the conservative case against john mccain in _meta_number_ref_ a conservative nightmare republican nominee john mccain and john mccain this guy _meta_end_question_

 really _meta_end_question_

 among many many other brutal attacks on amnesty john _meta_end_dot_

 on the bright side i suppose that if he becomes president no one can ever accuse me of refusing to criticize people on my own side but on the other hand that would mean john mccain would be the president of the united states _meta_end_dot_

 shudder _meta_end_exclamation_

 wait what was this column about again _meta_end_question_

 oh yes why conservatives should vote for john mccain in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 well somebody had to write this column since it s looking more and more likely that mccain is going to be the nominee and it s better that it isn t one of the people who actually like him because a lot of the things that need to be said about mr _meta_end_dot_

 straight talk aren t that pleasant _meta_end_dot_

 the truth is that john mccain could have been fairly called a conservative at one time but that is no longer an accurate designation for him _meta_end_dot_

 mccain is not just a squish or a rino he is a man who seems to take pleasure in publicly fighting against conservatives on issues of great import _meta_end_dot_

 that s why john mccain may become the de facto leader of the republican party if he s the nominee and the leader of the country if he s the president but no matter how many times he calls himself a conservative leader the right will accept him as the leader of the conservative movement about _meta_number_ref_ minutes after hell freezes over and reopens as a ski lodge _meta_end_dot_

 that being said there s another side to the story that has to be told _meta_end_dot_

 for all of his flaws and there are many of them john mccain is far to the right of barack obama and hillary clinton _meta_end_dot_

 those of us on the right tend to downplay that because a betrayal by someone on our own side stings much more sharply than one from a democrat but it is something conservatives should be willing to admit _meta_end_dot_

 it s also worth noting that these claims that mccain will destroy the conservative movement are unlikely to be true or alternately if they are then the conservative movement is probably too fragile to last any way _meta_end_dot_

 after all if the liberal movement could survive bill clinton a lying adulterer whose three greatest accomplishments welfare reform nafta and balancing the budget were all near and dear to the hearts of conservatives then we should be able to withstand mccain _meta_end_dot_

 more to the point although we cannot know exactly how things will play out it s very easy to imagine a scenario where a mccain presidency would be very good for the country and for conservatism _meta_end_dot_

 don t think it sounds possible _meta_end_question_

 well imagine this john mccain selects fred thompson as his vice president and defeats hillary clinton in november _meta_end_dot_

 although he has many negatives mccain is a fiscal conservative and it s easy to see him balancing the budget which would burnish the fiscal credentials of the republican party _meta_end_dot_

 mccain would also hang in there in iraq and insure that country is stable before we leave which would help the american public regain confidence in the gop on foreign policy again _meta_end_dot_

 next up is judges _meta_end_dot_

 john paul stevens is _meta_number_ref_ years old _meta_end_dot_

 ruth bader ginsburg is _meta_number_ref_ and has had cancer _meta_end_dot_

 does either of those two liberals make it through the next four years without retiring _meta_end_question_

 that s no small issue because the court is currently split with _meta_number_ref_ conservatives _meta_number_ref_ liberals and a moderate _meta_end_dot_

 that means a number of important cases including roe v _meta_end_dot_

 wade will probably be decided once and for all by the supreme court appointments of the next president of the united states _meta_end_dot_

 may god forgive us if we condemn a million plus children a year to death by abortion because we re angry at john mccain _meta_end_dot_

 then there s immigration where we know mccain is just dying to put the illegal immigrants in this country on a path to citizenship _meta_end_dot_

 however he has pledged to secure the border before he does that _meta_end_dot_

 in all honesty with the glacier like speed that the federal government moves there is zero chance that is going to be completed in the next four years _meta_end_dot_

 yet as security improves more and more illegal aliens will leave the country on their own _meta_end_dot_

 so even though mccain s motives wouldn t be pure enforcement by attrition would still occur during his first term and if conservatives hold mccain to his promise it s very possible that he wouldn t be able to implement amnesty by _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 of course there are a lot of other non conservative things that mccain would like to do but happily as we all know the founding fathers created a political system that moves slowly and is very prone to gridlock _meta_end_dot_

 that means it s possible that much of the rest of mccain s agenda would remain undone in his first term and it s entirely possible that mccain won t run again _meta_end_dot_

 he is after all almost _meta_number_ref_ years old and as chuck norris so bluntly reminded us the presidency does have a tendency to age a man well beyond his years _meta_end_dot_

 so think about where we could be a balanced budget the war in iraq won a conservative supreme court border security increased the republican party s reputation much improved and mccain leaving office in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 can you really tell me that sounds so bad _meta_end_question_

 granted that is a very rosy scenario but it s also relatively plausible and what s our alternative _meta_end_question_

 president hillary rodham clinton or president barack obama socialized medicine losing the war in iraq allowing al qaeda to run wild for _meta_number_ref_ years exploding deficits huge tax increases and a liberal leaning supreme court for the next decade _meta_end_dot_

 of course some people think there might be a conservative resurgence in opposition to a democratic president but don t kid yourself it s just as likely that a gop defeat could turn us into a squabbling minority party that is out of power for years while the left remakes this country in the image of belgium _meta_end_dot_

 does that mean you should vote for john mccain in november and like it no but it does mean that if john mccain is the nominee you should think very hard about holding your nose and voting for the viable candidate who would do the most good for our country _meta_end_dot_
