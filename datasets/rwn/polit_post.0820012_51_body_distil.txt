 those who would sacrifice liberty for security deserve neither misquoted ben franklin ben franklin being a brilliant man didn t ever actually say the above quote _meta_end_dot_

 what he really said was those who would give up essential liberty to purchase a little temporary safety deserve neither liberty nor safety if you re not a deep thinker those may seem to be small changes but those qualifiers make all the difference _meta_end_dot_

 people who truly bought into the original fake franklin quote wouldn t even put locks on their doors or child resistant caps on dangerous pills because even those tiny sacrifices of liberty for the sake of security would mean that they d deserve neither _meta_end_dot_

 jesus was a liberal liberal bumper sticker jesus as mike huckabee famously said was too smart to ever run for public office and he was not in any way shape or form a liberal or for that matter a conservative _meta_end_dot_

 look at israel for example where you have ragtag gangs of palestinian terrorists that have been fighting for decades with a military power capable of utterly crushing them in a few weeks time _meta_end_dot_

 the point is not that we should always take an eye for an eye it s that violence does often work there is a time to use it and when we do need to use it trading a tap on the wrist for a plucked eye isn t necessarily the best strategy _meta_end_dot_
