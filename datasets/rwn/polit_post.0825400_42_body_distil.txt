  instapundit has a round up _meta_end_dot_

 here s what obama says keep in mind that in the clip the crowd laughs uproariously and clearly believes that obama is referring to palin here s the text you know you can put lipstick on a pig obama said but it s still a pig the crowd rose and applauded some of them no doubt thinking he may have been alluding to alaska gov _meta_end_dot_

 sarah palin s ad lib during her vice presidential nomination acceptance speech last week what s the difference between a hockey mom and a pit bull _meta_end_question_

 lipstick you can wrap an old fish in a piece of paper called change obama continued it s still gonna stink after eight years _meta_end_dot_

 we ve had enough of the same old thing _meta_end_exclamation_

 it s time to bring about real change to washington _meta_end_dot_

 and that s the choice you ve got in this election obama added that it is not going to be easy _meta_end_dot_

 john mccain has a compelling biography you know sarah palin is an interesting story the crowd booed _meta_end_dot_

 no she s new obama said _meta_end_dot_

 she hasn t been on the scene you know she s got five kids and my hat goes off to anybody who s looking after five _meta_end_dot_

 i ve got two and they tire michelle and me out the obama trainwreck _meta_end_question_

 yes _meta_end_dot_

 since palin owns the word lipstick this season due to the punchline to her oft repeated hockey mom joke will the ever sensitive dems recognize the three glaring references to _meta_number_ref_ sarah palin is the pig in lipstick _meta_number_ref_ fish is a derogatory slang for women ask andrew sullivan if obama meant to imply all of that he is unfit to be president _meta_end_dot_

 civility hope change and new politics indeed _meta_end_dot_

 readers and conservatives generally have been full of respect for obama s intelligence _meta_end_dot_

 his gift is rhetorical and oratory _meta_end_dot_

 isn t it _meta_end_question_

 i wrote this to a blog friend there seems to be something inherent in the progressive i hate the misuse of the word liberal mindset that there is no governor no stop when they attack _meta_end_dot_

 they strangely view attacks against their policies as personal and feel that they are then liberated to go personal _meta_end_dot_

 but i think the underlying issue is narcissism _meta_end_dot_

 ideas are an extension of the self _meta_end_dot_

 to dispute them is to disparage the self _meta_end_dot_

 further i feel obama s personal slurs act as a confirmation that his campaign has been seeding kos and andrew sullivan with false stories _meta_end_dot_

 interestingly when obama was interviewed by bill o reilly he made the equivalence between fox commentators and kos kids _meta_end_dot_

 and he called the kos writers commentators _meta_end_dot_

 o reilly jumped on that statement but what was fascinating is that to obama s mind someone criticizing his ideas falls in the same category as kos kids slandering the palin family their children and them personally _meta_end_dot_

 obama is a smart guy _meta_end_dot_

 he said what he meant to say _meta_end_dot_

 that anyone is even attempting to defend him boggles the mind _meta_end_dot_

 there is no defense for this kind of talk _meta_end_dot_

 oprah _meta_end_exclamation_

 paging oprah _meta_end_exclamation_

 is this the kind of talk about women you support _meta_end_question_

 women pigs _meta_end_dot_

 that should get votes _meta_end_dot_

 and also this i believe that this effectively ended obama s chances _meta_end_dot_

 but it wasn t just his words _meta_end_dot_

 it was the crowd s reaction _meta_end_dot_

 the crowd laughed at this shameful display _meta_end_dot_

 obama s words speak to what is base and low in people _meta_end_dot_

 watching the whole interchange makes one wonder is this the america of hope and change updated time for pig and fish jokes from john and sarah _meta_end_dot_

 check out her sense of humor does anyone really expect this duo to whine and complain and be passive aggressive _meta_end_question_

 obama has that territory all sewn up _meta_end_dot_

 they might demand an apology _meta_end_dot_

 meh _meta_end_dot_

 poke fun _meta_end_dot_

 it works better _meta_end_dot_
