  _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ despite the fact that i have an ad for the debate at the top of rwn i had blessedly forgotten that there was a democratic debate tonight _meta_end_dot_

 ugh _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ you know what i like _meta_end_question_

 change _meta_end_exclamation_

 me too _meta_end_exclamation_

 know whom i don t like _meta_end_question_

 george bush _meta_end_exclamation_

 me too _meta_end_dot_

 i really want to cut and run in iraq _meta_end_dot_

 me too _meta_end_exclamation_

 i m going to pretend not to be offended that you have attacked me because i m black _meta_end_dot_

 i am going to pretend not to be a harpy who would have you killed for daring to challenge me if i could get away with it _meta_end_dot_

 wheeee _meta_end_exclamation_

 should be a blast _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ there are no rules _meta_end_question_

 quick someone get ron paul and mike gravel on the stage _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ how do we get past the divisions _meta_end_question_

 apparently with substance less rhetoric about the past and future hope and change _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ now we get pretend warm hillary _meta_end_dot_

 a war to end the economy doesn t work for most people _meta_end_question_

 socialism _meta_end_exclamation_

 socialism _meta_end_exclamation_

 bush sucks _meta_end_exclamation_

 socialism _meta_end_exclamation_

 we need a president who can on day one who can solve our problems _meta_end_dot_

 if so doesn t that disqualify hillary _meta_end_question_

 there isn t much evidence that s her _meta_end_dot_

 we need to talk about problem solving _meta_end_dot_

 barack believes in hope and change whereas i believe in change and hope so you can see that we have great differences _meta_end_exclamation_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ what differences do you two have _meta_end_question_

 hillary freeze interest rates for _meta_number_ref_ years and she s for realism and optimism on foreign policy _meta_end_dot_

 well ok _meta_end_dot_

 barack has some minor difference with her on health care _meta_end_dot_

 why look at us _meta_end_exclamation_

 we re not those awful white males that means we re not more of the same _meta_end_dot_

 that answer just emphasizes how similar they are _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ let s go into depth on the tiny difference between the socialized medicine plans hillary and i support _meta_end_dot_

 i don t support an interest rate freeze well that s something at least _meta_end_dot_

 the bush administration caused poor people to get houses that were way too expensive for them _meta_end_dot_

 it s predatory lending for people to give loans to poor people on houses that they know they can t afford _meta_end_dot_

 i was opposed to iraq from the start whereas hillary was against iraq as soon as the polls went the other way _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ barack here s a question to explain what you just explained about your socialized medicine plan in even more detail _meta_end_dot_

 this wonky stuff never ends up having any impact on the debate at all _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ hillary my socialized health care plan is better cheaper and easier _meta_end_dot_

 it mows your yard _meta_end_exclamation_

 it carries your children s books home from school _meta_end_dot_

 it takes your dogs out for long walks _meta_end_dot_

 this is such a wonky and dull debate so far _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ the first ted kennedy mention _meta_end_dot_

 barack will bring republicans and democrats together _meta_end_dot_

 i ll grant you he could do it a heck of a lot better than hillary but how much can republicans really cooperate with the agenda of the most liberal person in the senate _meta_end_question_

 for both sides to come together it will take actual compromise not just rhetoric _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ hillary you were secretive in your health care plan _meta_end_dot_

 what say you to that _meta_end_exclamation_

 hillary i will dodge the question and attack the insurance industry because they hate people with diabetes and cancer _meta_end_dot_

 the health insurance agency is clever and very determined not to be looted by us _meta_end_dot_

 i know how to outsmart them and take their money _meta_end_exclamation_

 this is the dullest _meta_number_ref_ minutes of any debate so far in the entire presidential campaign _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ they re going to call you tax and spend democrats _meta_end_dot_

 how do you deal with that _meta_end_dot_

 john mccain is in favor of tax cuts _meta_end_dot_

 back into the weeds _meta_end_dot_

 no real answer for that _meta_end_dot_

 my plan will conservatively save _meta_number_ref_ to _meta_number_ref_ billion a year _meta_end_dot_

 lol _meta_end_dot_

 does anyone believe that _meta_end_question_

 with taxes it s tax cuts for the rich _meta_end_exclamation_

 same old thing as usual with the democrats _meta_end_dot_

 i will go after the rich and the corporations while giving tax cuts to senior citizens and the middle class _meta_end_dot_

 we ve got to help the teachers who have to buy their own school supplies _meta_end_dot_

 gag _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ hillary i will kill the bush tax cuts _meta_end_dot_

 i will then save _meta_number_ref_ billion on modernizing and efficiency _meta_end_dot_

 since when does having an industry taken over by the government ever save anyone money _meta_end_question_

 ever _meta_end_question_

 i would raise taxes on health insurance companies _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ if you let the bush tax cuts expire it will be a tax increase _meta_end_dot_

 obama only on the wealthy _meta_end_question_

 since when is say the marriage penalty or the child tax credit something that helps only the wealthy _meta_end_question_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ immigration hurts african americans and costs them jobs _meta_end_dot_

 what say you _meta_end_question_

 very true by the way _meta_end_dot_

 obama it s not immigration _meta_end_dot_

 there were problems before the immigrants _meta_end_dot_

 that s scapegoating _meta_end_dot_

 immigrants don t cause problems for african americans _meta_end_dot_

 cough cough liar _meta_end_dot_

 we have to control the borders _meta_end_dot_

 we do have to crack down on employers because they re mean to illegals _meta_end_question_

 yeesh _meta_end_dot_

 that s why we need a crackdown _meta_end_question_

 we need a pathway to citizenship _meta_end_dot_

 the problem isn t illegal immigration it s those tax cuts and not spending enough money for schools _meta_end_dot_

 he sounds really really out of touch _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ hillary because of employers who exploit workers there are job losses _meta_end_dot_

 wow hillary is more honest than barack on this _meta_end_dot_

 illegals steal construction jobs _meta_end_dot_

 hillary we need comprehensive immigration reform _meta_end_dot_

 in other words she wants mccain kennedy which even mccain says he won t vote for now i don t believe him but he says it _meta_end_dot_

 hillary doesn t believe in deporting people _meta_end_dot_

 ok _meta_end_dot_

 wait she does believe in deporting illegals who commit crimes besides being here illegally _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ barack let s be honest illegal immigration is a divisive issue _meta_end_dot_

 you think _meta_end_question_

 are the other candidates not pushing humane issues on immigration _meta_end_dot_

 meaningless pap _meta_end_dot_

 barack is dodging and weaving left and right rather than say something mean about clinton _meta_end_dot_

 drivers licenses are irrelevant because of comprehensive illegal immigration _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ wolf realizes how dull this is and tries to get some fighting going _meta_end_dot_

 were you missing in action on illegal immigration hillary _meta_end_question_

 no i sponsored a bill on it before barack was in the senate _meta_end_dot_

 the republicans are mean spirited on illegal immigration _meta_end_dot_

 you are undermining the values of america if you don t want unlimited illegal immigration apparently _meta_end_dot_

 now hillary is against drive s licenses for illegals _meta_end_dot_

 she was for it before she was against it _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ it took hillary a long while to get to her drivers licenses position _meta_end_dot_

 she was for it then against it _meta_end_dot_

 now she s clear _meta_end_dot_

 she wasn t there _meta_end_dot_

 i oppose drivers licenses for illegals _meta_end_dot_

 who is going to tackle this and solve it _meta_end_question_

 me or hillary _meta_end_question_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ hillary i have to correct the record _meta_end_dot_

 you couldn t answer a question about drivers licenses for illegals after my answer _meta_end_dot_

 also true _meta_end_dot_

 happened during a debate _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ wolf says that when they get back from the debate they re going to talk experience and character _meta_end_dot_

 that should be good for a laugh _meta_end_dot_

 neither of them has any real experience and hillary doesn t have any character either _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ a lot of americans think hillary is more experienced than you and ready to move forward on day _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 obama i am all about change change ch ch ch angggggggggge _meta_end_exclamation_

 oh and unity _meta_end_dot_

 plus i m against special interests is there a more meaningless phrase in politics than special interests _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ wolf what experience as first lady qualifies you to be president _meta_end_question_

 hillary i worked for the children s legal defense fund _meta_end_dot_

 this reminds me of someone padding their resume with clubs they never attended to get a company to hire them _meta_end_dot_

 hillary went to _meta_number_ref_ countries _meta_end_dot_

 she claims to have negotiated deals with other countries _meta_end_dot_

 do you believe her _meta_end_question_

 she teamed up with lindsey graham to do something or another _meta_end_dot_

 boy that s thin for someone who talks about how experienced she is all the time _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ the country is a very large business _meta_end_dot_

 neither of you has run a business _meta_end_dot_

 hillary the country isn t a business it s a trust _meta_end_dot_

 that s what bush wanted to do run the country as a business _meta_end_dot_

 barack mitt hasn t gotten a good return on his campaign _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ hillary ted kennedy and caroline kennedy endorsed obama _meta_end_dot_

 how do you respond to kennedy endorsing obama _meta_end_dot_

 hillary _meta_number_ref_ of robert kennedy s children support me _meta_end_exclamation_

 hillary i love change _meta_end_exclamation_

 the first woman president would be a big change _meta_end_exclamation_

 but it s about us not ted kennedy _meta_end_dot_

 i am ready to go on day _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 i can fight the republicans and win _meta_end_exclamation_

 are we going to be once again proud of our country _meta_end_question_

 so hillary isn t proud of her country now _meta_end_question_

 not a big surprise _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ barack should democrats be happy about the _meta_number_ref_ years of the clinton administration _meta_end_question_

 honestly if you re a liberal you shouldn t be too happy _meta_end_dot_

 barack i am bringing in new voters _meta_end_dot_

 i can call on the american people to reach higher _meta_end_dot_

 the turnout has been huge so far _meta_end_exclamation_

 very true and very bad for republicans _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ hillary how can you be an agent of change when we have had the same two families in the white house for _meta_number_ref_ years _meta_end_question_

 hillary judge me on my merits not as a clinton _meta_end_dot_

 lol what _meta_end_question_

 she d be a bad joke as a candidate if she wasn t bill s wife _meta_end_dot_

 wait now she s talking about the nineties _meta_end_dot_

 so she does want to be judged on her husband s merits _meta_end_dot_

 it took a clinton to clean up after the first bush and it will take another clinton to clean up after the _meta_number_ref_nd bush _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ hillary you haven t offered a specific end date in iraq _meta_end_dot_

 how do we know you won t be there forever _meta_end_dot_

 i won t _meta_end_dot_

 all troops should be out within a year _meta_end_dot_

 i yelled at the pentagon last year because they hadn t planned enough to lose _meta_end_dot_

 we need to get everybody out and we have to think about the american citizens _meta_end_dot_

 also what about the iraqis who sided with us _meta_end_question_

 we are going to leave them in the lurch so we have to figure out what we do for them _meta_end_dot_

 it s irresponsible for bush not to have the whole thing wrapped up in a very neat little bow before he leaves office _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ obama _meta_end_dot_

 i will end the war _meta_end_dot_

 i will get everyone out _meta_end_dot_

 these two just can t wait to lose this war _meta_end_dot_

 the sooner the country collapses and al qaeda starts running wild the better for obama and hillary _meta_end_dot_

 there is zero consideration or discussion of victory from either of them _meta_end_dot_

 last guy who ran promising to lose a war was george mcgovern _meta_end_dot_

 he was slaughtered _meta_end_dot_

 just something to think about _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ hillary wants to send a message to the region as we withdraw _meta_end_dot_

 is hillary suggesting that having the surrounding region dragged into a giant regional war is a positive _meta_end_question_

 i think she is _meta_end_dot_

 that s just nutty _meta_end_dot_

 this whole nonsense about bush binding the us in iraq if they don t want to be there is silly _meta_end_dot_

 once he s gone i don t care what he agrees to it s out of his hands _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ now we re back in the weeds _meta_end_dot_

 hillary why didn t you vote for the levin amendment _meta_end_question_

 i didn t want to let the un make a decision for us on iraq _meta_end_dot_

 does anyone believe hillary when she thought that she wasn t giving bush the authority to go to war _meta_end_dot_

 mccain is accusing me of surrendering because i want to surrender in the first _meta_number_ref_ days _meta_end_dot_

 well yeah _meta_end_dot_

 hillary is saying she has the gravitas to be commander in chief _meta_end_question_

 compared to mccain _meta_end_question_

 that s a laugh _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ obama the idea that democrats don t want to see progress in iraq or don t want this to end honorably is ridiculous _meta_end_dot_

 you can t argue for leaving iraq despite what has happened and no matter what happens and say that truthfully _meta_end_dot_

 barack it would be easier for me to debate mccain because i can say i was against it from the beginning _meta_end_dot_

 really i don t think it will _meta_end_dot_

 it doesn t matter who did what in _meta_number_ref_ it will matter who will do what in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ hillary gives the big dopey grin _meta_end_dot_

 hillary why won t you say your iraq vote was a mistake _meta_end_question_

 well i m just not going to admit it _meta_end_dot_

 it really doesn t make much sense _meta_end_dot_

 she clearly thinks it s a mistake given how she has explained it so why not just say so _meta_end_question_

 must be some logic to it that she has that i can t see _meta_end_dot_

 bush was obsessed with going to war _meta_end_dot_

 come on everybody knew that congress was voting on whether to go to war _meta_end_dot_

 i voted for the war in iraq but i would have never gone there had i been president _meta_end_dot_

 wow she s a real weasel _meta_end_dot_

 hillary we are as strong as the republicans on national security if we can show we can go after terrorists then we can join the issues of the future _meta_end_dot_

 george bush sent people to war without body armor _meta_end_dot_

 if so it was only because bill clinton didn t provide any _meta_end_dot_

 wolf were you naive to trust george bush hillary _meta_end_question_

 honest answer yes _meta_end_dot_

 answer more dodging _meta_end_dot_

 hillary is losing the debate now with this question _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ barack of course it was a vote to go to war _meta_end_dot_

 hillary says she has the experience on day _meta_number_ref_ but she was wrong on day _meta_number_ref_ about the iraq war _meta_end_dot_

 barack closed strong _meta_end_dot_

 oh geeze i was hoping this was an hour and a half debate and was just running a little long _meta_end_dot_

 apparently it s two hours _meta_end_dot_

 ugh they should make the terrorists at gitmo watch this crap _meta_end_dot_

 they would tell us everything they know just to make it stop _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ go to commercial break _meta_end_exclamation_

 the longer it lasts the less of this dull debate we have to watch _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ obama is there too much sex and violence coming out of hollywood _meta_end_question_

 if so what will you do _meta_end_question_

 i am concerned _meta_end_dot_

 i have kids _meta_end_dot_

 primary responsibility is for parents _meta_end_dot_

 the internet is a problem too _meta_end_dot_

 we have to invest in technologies and tools to empower parents _meta_end_dot_

 i do think it is important for people in the industry to show some responsibility about whom they market their goods to _meta_end_dot_

 i think that answer is fine _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ senator clinton your husband has set off several firestorms in the past few weeks _meta_end_dot_

 if your campaign can t control bill now what will it be like when he s in the white house _meta_end_question_

 i am running for president and i want the campaign to stay focused on issues and me _meta_end_dot_

 the most insincere answer yet _meta_end_dot_

 my name is on the ballot not bill but i will make decisions _meta_end_dot_

 it s a choice between the two of us _meta_end_dot_

 but i am sending bill out everywhere on my behalf claiming credit for his accomplishments etc etc _meta_end_dot_

 ugh _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ would you consider a clinton obama ticket _meta_end_question_

 barack it s premature to speculate about that _meta_end_dot_

 barack courageously says he d like to restore a sense of confidence in what s possible in government _meta_end_dot_

 he s a living breathing hallmark card _meta_end_dot_

 he s an inch deep _meta_end_dot_

 we need to have people think government is on their side _meta_end_dot_

 hillary would be on anybody s short list _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ i agree with what barack said _meta_end_dot_

 it has been intense _meta_end_dot_

 we will have a unified democratic party _meta_end_dot_

 we will go into the november elections prepared to win _meta_end_dot_

 hill promotes her website _meta_end_dot_

 no answer to question _meta_end_dot_

 that s it _meta_end_dot_

 summary this was an incredibly dull debate _meta_end_dot_

 the first _meta_number_ref_ minutes especially were like a wonky debate between two people in a think tank _meta_end_dot_

 it was just painful to sit through _meta_end_dot_

 early on hillary was winning in part because it was so dull and because she scored some points on barack over the immigration issue _meta_end_dot_

 but hill choked on her iraq war question and she was incredibly insincere about her husband while barack picked up the pace at the end _meta_end_dot_

 so _meta_end_dot_

 winner barack obama _meta_end_dot_

 loser hillary clinton _meta_end_dot_

 however it was probably not a huge difference maker of a debate although i could see the last _meta_number_ref_ minutes of the debate swinging a few people towards obama _meta_end_dot_
