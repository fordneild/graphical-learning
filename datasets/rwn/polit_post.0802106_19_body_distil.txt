  in nevada mitt romney crushed all opposition and ron paul edged out john mccain for _meta_number_ref_nd place _meta_end_dot_

 in south carolina which was more hotly contested and was treated as the more important of the two primaries john mccain won mike huckabee finished just behind in _meta_number_ref_nd place and fred thompson edged out mitt romney for a distant _meta_number_ref_rd place _meta_end_dot_

 here s the fall out _meta_end_dot_

 fred really needed to win south carolina to get enough momentum to have a decent shot to win on super tuesday and a close _meta_number_ref_nd place finish to at least stay in the hunt _meta_end_dot_

 he didn t get either and thus whether he officially drops out or not he won t capture the nomination _meta_end_dot_

 south carolina was a dream killer for mike huckabee as well _meta_end_dot_

 a win in sc would have given huckabee a decent chance to win florida and a boost in his national numbers _meta_end_dot_

 unfortunately a _meta_number_ref_nd place finish doesn t quite cut it _meta_end_dot_

 pre south carolina huckabee was in _meta_number_ref_nd place nationally but well behind mccain and his numbers also seemed to be slipping a bit in florida _meta_end_dot_

 his loss in south carolina may cause his numbers to dip even further _meta_end_dot_

 is huckabee out of it _meta_end_question_

 no but the points fred thompson took out of his hide in south carolina were probably the difference between victory and defeat in that state and ultimately could be the undoing of his candidacy _meta_end_dot_

 rudy giuliani has put up pathetic numbers in every state so far and his national numbers have dropped significantly so his entire campaign is now riding on winning florida _meta_end_dot_

 on the upside rudy has spent far more time and money in florida than any of the other candidates and if he wins he should get enough of a boost to put him in contention for the nomination _meta_end_dot_

 on the other hand florida is essentially a _meta_number_ref_ way dance between rudy mccain mitt and huckabee and mitt and mccain are coming off of wins in nevada and south carolina respectively _meta_end_dot_

 moreover pre south carolina mccain was polling slightly but consistently ahead of rudy in florida _meta_end_dot_

 that means the odds are probably against rudy but they re not insurmountable _meta_end_dot_

 mitt romney has now won michigan and nevada _meta_end_dot_

 he s also in the hunt in florida _meta_end_dot_

 moreover if fred thompson drops out you have to think a large chunk of his support would move over to the most conservative candidate remaining in the race which is generally considered to be mitt romney _meta_end_dot_

 that s the good news _meta_end_dot_

 the bad news is that mitt is significantly behind john mccain nationally and in the key feb _meta_number_ref_ states that have been polled mitt is behind mccain in all of them _meta_end_dot_

 this underscores a key weakness for mitt he has run an exceptional campaign but for whatever reason people tend not to like him very much _meta_end_dot_

 that is something he has been able to overcome to a certain degree at least in the early states through superior organization _meta_end_dot_

 that won t work for him on feb _meta_number_ref_ which will be more about poll numbers than skill at campaigning _meta_end_dot_

 mitt s dream scenario at this point would be for fred to drop out and have most of his supporters move over to rudy _meta_end_dot_

 then next mitt would get a boost after winning florida rudy would finish in _meta_number_ref_nd place and stay in to bleed off moderate voters from mccain and johnny mac would lose steam after being pummeled by talk radio and finishing out of the top two slots _meta_end_dot_

 still despite the fact that mitt has done pretty well in primaries overall it feels like a real uphill struggle for him to make headway _meta_end_dot_

 ps in nevada mitt captured more than _meta_percent_ref_ of the mormon vote which is ironic if you think about the way republicans have been told that it would be bigoted to take his religion into consideration _meta_end_dot_

 apparently the mormons in nevada didn t pay any attention to that message because they obviously took mitt s religion into consideration before they voted for him _meta_end_dot_

 at this point john mccain is definitely the front runner _meta_end_dot_

 he captured conservative south carolina and pre south carolina he had a small but significant polling edge in florida _meta_end_dot_

 he also had a significant lead in the national polling and a lead in large super tuesday states like california new jersey and pennsylvania _meta_end_dot_

 at this point mccain is probably the only candidate who could come in _meta_number_ref_rd place or lower in florida and still have a good chance to pull out the nomination _meta_end_dot_

 is mccain still stoppable _meta_end_question_

 yes but he has a better chance to capture the nomination than the rest of the field combined at this point _meta_end_dot_
