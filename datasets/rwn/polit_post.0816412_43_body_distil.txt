  even on the left side of the blogosphere where tortured reasoning has been elevated to an art form seldom have i ever seen anything that can top this rigmarole from cristina page at the huffpo obama the real pro life candidate obama has a huge opportunity to win over an unlikely voting bloc pro life voters _meta_end_dot_

 the debate over reproductive rights has for decades existed in the abstract it s been a back and forth volley over values that s heavy on emotion and light on fact _meta_end_dot_

 but the facts reveal surprising truths and they ought to be hammered home by obama _meta_end_dot_

 the data show that the pro choice approach is more effective at achieving what the american public views as pro life goals i e _meta_end_dot_

 reducing the number of abortions preventing late term abortion than the so called pro life approach _meta_end_dot_

 mccain may campaign on the immorality of abortion but the policies he supports seem to lead to lots more of them _meta_end_dot_

 isn t it time to turn the tables _meta_end_question_

 obama should hold mccain and other anti choice leaders accountable for their failure to find solutions to the high rates of unintended pregnancy and abortion _meta_end_dot_

 he has the opportunity to change the debate _meta_end_dot_

 it s not about abortion it s about preventing unwanted pregnancy _meta_end_dot_

 that s an intriguing take on the whole issue isn t it _meta_end_question_

 the guy who is pro abortion in almost every situation and has said this _meta_end_dot_

 look i got two daughters _meta_number_ref_ years old and _meta_number_ref_ years old he said _meta_end_dot_

 i am going to teach them first about values and morals but if they make a mistake i don t want them punished with a baby _meta_end_dot_

 i don t want them punished with an std at age _meta_number_ref_ so it doesn t make sense to not give them information is the candidate for pro lifers _meta_end_dot_

 shouldn t the candidate for pro lifers actually be pro life _meta_end_question_

 not according to cristina page _meta_end_dot_

 also the entire liberals are better at preventing unwanted pregnancy tripe takes an enormous amount of gall to even throw out there _meta_end_dot_

 liberals are constantly assaulting the church giving kids condoms and telling them to have sex creating tv shows that say you can have sex without consequences complaining about slut shaming and promoting a lifestyle centered around promiscuity _meta_end_dot_

 then when impressionable kids pick up on all of this and start having sex you have liberals making the dubious claim that they re better at preventing them from getting pregnant _meta_end_dot_

 that s sort of like telling kids to jump off a building giving them a few tips on how to turn in mid air and taking credit for minimizing the number of injuries from falls _meta_end_dot_

 it s just ridiculous even for the huffpo _meta_end_dot_
