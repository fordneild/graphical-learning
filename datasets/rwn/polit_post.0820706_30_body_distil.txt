  over the last few years we ve heard endless comparisons between george bush and hitler but let s face it obama has a lot more in common with hitler than bush ever did _meta_end_dot_

 obama is toweringly arrogant uses messianic fascistic rhetoric seems to have ambitions that stretch past his own country to the world and has legions of mind numbed zombielike followers doing his bidding and blaming all their problems on convenient scapegoats _meta_end_dot_

 so with that in mind meet obamahitler _meta_end_exclamation_

 i ll grant you i wasn t the first blog to come up with the phrase obamahitler but i d like to be known as the blogger who popularized it _meta_end_dot_

 after all look at how well the netroots did by spewing out this kind of invective and as we all know imitation is the sincerest form of flattery _meta_end_dot_

 plus the mustache and the fanatical legions of sieg heiling fans just fits obama much better than it ever did bush doesn t it _meta_end_question_

 ps since this is a what s good for the goose is good for the gander type of post isn t it also fair to say that since barack obama supports the war in afghanistan but has never served he s a gutless chickenhawk _meta_end_question_

 i think it is _meta_end_dot_
