  from now through the election i m going to be taking an opportunity every week to try to give a boost to some of the republican candidates who deserve it the most _meta_end_dot_

 that ll be through interviews and through fundraising via slatecard _meta_end_dot_

 today i d like to take a moment to give you a very brief rundown on the candidates i m currently raising money for through slatecard _meta_end_dot_

 first off is sydney hay _meta_end_dot_

 i can tell you definitively that she is the sort of conservative we want in dc because she was duncan hunter s campaign manager and i got to talk with her a few times when i worked on the campaign _meta_end_dot_

 sydney is going to be the gop candidate in az _meta_number_ref_ a key swing district _meta_end_dot_

 will breazeale is a diehard conservative and he fought in iraq _meta_end_dot_

 i ve met will a couple of times and i think if he can raise enough money he can be competitive in nc _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 but he will need money to make it work _meta_end_dot_

 duncan d _meta_end_dot_

 hunter is another iraqi vet _meta_end_dot_

 he s running for his dad s seat and i can verify that he is a competent conservative guy who gets the blogosphere because i worked with him on the hunter campaign _meta_end_dot_

 this is another guy we should really want in congress _meta_end_dot_

 sean parnell is up against corrupt appropriator don young in a late august primary and the last poll i saw had him ahead by a nose _meta_end_dot_

 here s my big pitch for sean parnell he s not don young _meta_end_dot_

 i don t agree with everything david cuddy stands for he s a little too libertarian for me but i agree with most of it and i can tell you that he looks like he s the only guy with a realistic shot to knock off corrupt incompetent gop nightmare ted stevens _meta_end_dot_

 so cuddy would be an enormous step up and he may turn out to be our only realistic shot to keep the seat _meta_end_dot_

 lt _meta_end_dot_

 colonel bill russell is going head to head with corrupt loud mouth john murtha _meta_end_dot_

 need i say more _meta_end_question_

 as time goes on i will add more candidates to the list but i ve decided that i would rather start with a small select group and work my way out rather than a big expansive list _meta_end_dot_

 what i m hoping you will do is pick the candidate that appeals to you the most and chip in _meta_dollor_ref_ to that person _meta_end_dot_

 that doesn t sound like a lot of money and it isn t but if enough people do it it will really add up _meta_end_dot_

 i hope you ll consider it _meta_end_dot_
