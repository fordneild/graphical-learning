  t he heritage foundation takes a look at what obama promises for taxes should he be elected and what that means obama s tax plan has two major components _meta_end_dot_

 first he promises to end the bush tax cuts allowing the top two tax rates to return to _meta_percent_ref_ and _meta_number_ref_ _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 second he promises to end the social security payroll tax cap for incomes above _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 individuals making more than _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ therefore would face a _meta_number_ref_ _meta_percent_ref_ tax rate from payroll taxes in addition to a top income tax rate of _meta_number_ref_ _meta_percent_ref_ for a combined tax rate over _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 individuals living in cities or states with high taxes such as new york city or california would have tax rates approaching _meta_percent_ref_ levels not seen since jimmy carter was in office _meta_end_dot_

 this from a man who claims to want to ensure that he puts policies in place to help the economy _meta_end_dot_

 instead higher taxes especially in the range being talked about here have three effects _meta_end_dot_

 one tax avoidance _meta_end_dot_

 people effected by high taxes are going to try every legal means such as tax shelters to avoid paying taxes on their earnings _meta_end_dot_

 these gimmicks both reduce investment and economic growth in an attempt to avoid punitive taxation _meta_end_dot_

 some individuals will attempt to transfer their compensation from wages to capital gains since capital gains would only be taxed at _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 others might try to incorporate so they could pay business taxes instead of income taxes _meta_end_dot_

 all of these schemes divert resources away from wealth creation and to lawyers and accountants who implement these schemes _meta_end_dot_

 two income flight _meta_end_dot_

 money and capital will be moved to overseas location where it is taxed at a much lower rate _meta_end_dot_

 visiting britain recently french president nicols sarkozy remarked that france s high taxes had driven so many french to london that it had become the seventh largest french city _meta_end_dot_

 obama sized tax rates would drive many creative americans to canada and london as well _meta_end_dot_

 or ireland _meta_end_dot_

 capital is going to seek a friendly tax climate for investment _meta_end_dot_

 three unemployment _meta_end_dot_

 when investment slows the economy slows _meta_end_dot_

 and when the economy slows the fastest way to effect the bottom line is to reduce headcount _meta_end_dot_

 currently only six of the top _meta_number_ref_ industrial nations have combined local and national tax rates above _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 the average unemployment rate rate for those countries is _meta_number_ref_ _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 under obama s plan the top marginal tax rate would exceed _meta_percent_ref_ which means only hungary would have a more punitive tax rate _meta_end_dot_

 hungary s _meta_number_ref_ unemployment rate was _meta_number_ref_ _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 couple that plan with the obama plan to impose windfall taxes on the oil companies for which the consumer will pay at the pump biofuel mandates for which the consumer will pay higher food prices and and a carbon tax for which the consumer will pay as well and you have all the makings of an economic disaster _meta_end_dot_
