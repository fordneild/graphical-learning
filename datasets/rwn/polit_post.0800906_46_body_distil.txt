  i m not a fan of john mccain and i don t want him as the nominee but if i could give him one piece of advice it would be this support for amnesty nearly killed your campaign earlier this year and if you get the nomination your support for amnesty will kill fundraising for your campaign and for the republican party in the general election _meta_end_dot_

 with that in mind the best thing for you to do would be to dump amnesty but obviously if you were going to do that you would have done it already _meta_end_dot_

 however what you have said is that you got the message that the american people don t trust the government to secure the border so that has to come first before any sort of path to citizenship _meta_end_dot_

 so in order to placate the anti amnesty crowd what you should do is say that you do support a path to citizenship for illegals but that it can t come until the border is secure we have a plan in place to keep illegals from getting jobs and here s the key part that will likely take more than _meta_number_ref_ years _meta_end_dot_

 in other words let people know you re going to kick the can down the road on amnesty until your second term _meta_end_dot_

 granted that s a compromise solution that isn t going to make everyone happy and moreover it could make it more difficult to get elected in _meta_number_ref_ but getting elected in _meta_number_ref_ comes first and it will be tough enough without trying to fight a year long battle against a large extremely passionate segment of your own base _meta_end_dot_

 the hard core anti illegal immigration crowd in the gop is never going to love you but if you can at least keep them from actively opposing you it would be very helpful to your campaign _meta_end_dot_

 plus you can still tell the chamber of commerce crowd that yes you do support a path to citizenship _meta_end_dot_

 if you don t go that route you re going to have a small percentage of republican who will for good or ill decide that it would be better for the country for you to lose in _meta_number_ref_ because of the amnesty issue and thereby send a message to other politicians than for you to win and push through an amnesty that will do enormous damage to the country and will ensure the long term weakening of conservatism in the united states _meta_end_dot_
