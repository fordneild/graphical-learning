  as most of you probably already know bernard kerik is facing some rather severe legal troubles bernard kerik lied schemed and sold out the city all under the nose of his mentor and pal presidential candidate rudy giuliani _meta_end_dot_

 that is the stark portrait painted in the _meta_number_ref_ count indictment unsealed yesterday in white plains federal court almost exactly one year before election day _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 while the political fallout remains uncertain the effect on kerik s image as a sept _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ hero is devastating _meta_end_dot_

 in meticulous detail manhattan u s _meta_end_dot_

 attorney michael garcia assembled count after count painting kerik as a money grubbing liar who tried to cover his tracks _meta_end_dot_

 the indictment says the misdeeds took place as giuliani promoted his former driver to the top levels of his administration from running city prisons to heading the largest police force in america _meta_end_dot_

 yesterday kerik _meta_number_ref_ stood ramrod straight in a white shirt red tie and navy blue jacket to declare not guilty your honor in court moments before being freed on a _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ bail bond backed up by his new jersey mansion _meta_end_dot_

 outside he could not resist bringing up sept _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ the worst challenges until this time were my challenges during and after _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 this is a battle i m going to fight the indictment charges kerik with conspiracy tax fraud making false statements and depriving the city of his honest services _meta_end_dot_

 if convicted he faces up to _meta_number_ref_ years in prison and up to _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ million in fines folks this doesn t just reflect poorly on bernard kerik it raises serious questions about rudy giuliani _meta_end_dot_

 bernard kerik is not just some tangential figure in rudy bernard giuliani s life rudy was kerik s patron business partner and friend _meta_end_dot_

 not only did rudy promote him in his administration in new york he recommended him to be the secretary of homeland security _meta_end_dot_

 people have taken shots at hillary and rightfully so over the sleazy people she s connected to like norman hsu and sandy berger but this is far worse because kerik is so tightly tied to giuliani _meta_end_dot_

 it raises a lot of troubling questions like was giuliani aware that he was working closely with someone faced with troubling ethical questions _meta_end_question_

 if not why wasn t kerik properly vetted and how many other people with ethical problems are connected to rudy _meta_end_question_

 if rudy was aware that kerik may have been dirty does that mean rudy has ethical issues of his own or is tolerant of people who are dirty _meta_end_question_

 either way you have to admit that it s entirely possible that there are more people with serious ethical issues surrounding rudy _meta_end_dot_

 folks you should be aware that rudy now has an enormous bullseye on his back on the ethics issue and every mainstream media publication in america is probably assigning people to go through his background and the background of everyone associated with him using a fine tooth comb _meta_end_dot_

 if you think you re tired of hearing the words culture of corruption now you just wait and see how you feel about it if rudy s the nominee and there turns out to be _meta_number_ref_ or _meta_number_ref_ characters as shady as kerik connected to him _meta_end_dot_

 it will be a disaster and yes it may very well happen _meta_end_dot_
