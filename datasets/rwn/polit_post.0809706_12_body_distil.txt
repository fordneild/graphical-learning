  amanda marcotte is at it again and by it i mean illustrating why feminists hurt themselves when it comes to abortion _meta_end_dot_

 statements like this are so repulsive to the average person i appreciate the idea that visibility is critical to getting people to understand that women who get abortions or rape victims two groups dehumanized and demonized in an effort to strip them of their rights are human beings _meta_end_dot_

 i was in full support of the i had an abortion t shirt because to me it s not complicated _meta_end_dot_

 the anti choice movement tries like hell to erase women s existence or at least our individuality and the t shirt undermines that _meta_end_dot_

 it also clarifies that abortion is nothing to be ashamed of _meta_end_dot_

 for me i had an abortion should be as morally loaded as i had a pap smear _meta_end_dot_

 the underpinnings of the moral angst about abortion the idea that a woman has no right to pry loose a flag a man has planted in her even if he agrees with her decision as most men in this case do or that she should be punished for having sex offend me to the core and that many women go through anguish over getting abortions depresses me _meta_end_dot_

 they shouldn t feel bad for having sex or having autonomy _meta_end_dot_

 in fact they should be proud of themselves for taking care of themselves despite all the misogynist messages out there that women don t have a right to take care of ourselves _meta_end_dot_

 people balked at the idea that the i had an abortion t shirts smacked of that mortal female sin of pride but i applaud it _meta_end_dot_

 women should be proud of doing right by themselves in a world where that s socially disavowed _meta_end_dot_

 ann althouse who believes in abortion says this the abortion shirt on the other hand admits that you ve done something for yourself that involved sacrificing what many people believe is another human being _meta_end_dot_

 why do you want to say that by t shirt _meta_end_question_

 in marcotte s view it s to show that you re proud of taking care of yourself despite all the misogynist messages out there i thought it was more to normalize abortion to make it seem ordinary widespread and something that would be done without shame by nice upstanding women _meta_end_dot_

 i happen to believe that abortion is wrong _meta_end_dot_

 period _meta_end_dot_

 however i can understand a woman s claim to her own body _meta_end_dot_

 i can understand the fear of an unwanted pregnancy _meta_end_dot_

 most women have had that fear at one time in their life _meta_end_dot_

 so as much as i find abortion repugnant i don t find those who feel trapped and make that decision repugnant _meta_end_dot_

 it can seem perfectly rational at the time _meta_end_dot_

 still i know only two women who haven t regretted their decision and often the forced decision to abort a child _meta_end_dot_

 abortion is a tortured experience for a woman because it is a morally fraught decision _meta_end_dot_

 the same woman who aborts a fetus will call a wanted child her baby the instant she reports the joy of her pregnancy _meta_end_dot_

 many women regret being moved by fear or helplessness _meta_end_dot_

 many women resent the manipulation by boyfriends husbands and family when she wants the baby _meta_end_dot_

 many women would choose differently if given the choice again _meta_end_dot_

 this reality seems to be lost by those like amanda marcotte _meta_end_dot_

 in her absolutist world there is no ambiguity around the topic _meta_end_dot_

 there is no such thing as regret or conflict _meta_end_dot_

 women should wear their abortions with pride _meta_end_dot_

 it is a sign of self affirmation _meta_end_dot_

 and she actually touches on the heart of the problem _meta_end_dot_

 at it s heart abortion is a selfish decision _meta_end_dot_

 a woman is choosing her own comfort over the discomfort and inconvenience of an unplanned for child i am not touching on the anguish a raped woman feels in facing the future _meta_end_dot_

 and she feels women should wear this selfishness with pride _meta_end_dot_

 she does a disservice to the reproductive rights crowd and harms her own movement by being so cavalier about the implications of the decision to abort _meta_end_dot_

 society benefits that shame is associated with the right to choose is there no shame anymore _meta_end_question_

 even with the shame far too many people engage in sex without thought and consideration of the consequences that can result in another being paying the ultimate price for momentary pleasure _meta_end_dot_

 removing the shame would simply increase the number of abortions and multiply the regret of many more people who stopped by their conscience opt to have a child and make it work instead of choosing abortion _meta_end_dot_

 the real shame is that feminists elevate selfishness and refuse to see the conflict inherent in the decision to abort _meta_end_dot_

 by doing so they harm women they ostensibly desire to help _meta_end_dot_
