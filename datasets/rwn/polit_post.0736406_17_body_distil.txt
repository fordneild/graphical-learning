  why do we care about the middle east _meta_end_question_

 when people ask me that question it still shocks me _meta_end_dot_

 do they really not get it _meta_end_question_

 maybe with the murder of benazar bhutto of pakistan we need a reminder why it is in america s in the world s best interest to care about this sandy forsaken landscape half way around the world _meta_end_dot_

 it has been my belief since the beginning that george w _meta_end_dot_

 bush entered iraq secondarily because of saddam hussein s wmd flirtations _meta_end_dot_

 yes everyone including the lily livered democrats and squishy republicans believed saddam was a bad guy desiring to do bad things with bad substances _meta_end_dot_

 he had done bad things _meta_end_dot_

 it wasn t a stretch that he d do more bad things _meta_end_dot_

 but that didn t seem to me to be the most compelling reason for iraq _meta_end_dot_

 to me and i feel that george bush must have seen this too iraq is first and foremost a strategic launching pad _meta_end_dot_

 for all saddam s bluster he was weak _meta_end_dot_

 no one could imagine how weak until the yanks marched through iraq _meta_end_dot_

 it happened so quickly everyone was stunned _meta_end_dot_

 but the fall and subsequent search for scant wmds mattered less than being planted as a bulwark against crazy in the middle east _meta_end_dot_

 iraq borders iran syria jordan turkey a couple stans and a lovely thing called the persian gulf _meta_end_dot_

 trouble brews in every place on the list _meta_end_dot_

 and trouble there means trouble everywhere _meta_end_dot_

 russia trembles with hypermasculine impotence _meta_end_dot_

 any way to cause trouble to the alpha males of the world will be and are being embraced _meta_end_dot_

 putin squeezes europe already _meta_end_dot_

 georgia sits like a plum in a vice _meta_end_dot_

 iran would happily be the conduit for putin s displeasure _meta_end_dot_

 more on all this here _meta_end_dot_

 meanwhile afghanistan and pakistan boil with extremism _meta_end_dot_

 here s what s happening now we ve really got a new situation here in western pakistan said army col _meta_end_dot_

 u s _meta_end_dot_

 military headquarters for pakistan and the middle east _meta_end_dot_

 he said the and predicted the coming months would bring concentrated attacks on other domestic political stew in pakistan said john blackton who served as a u s _meta_end_dot_

 pakistani military intelligence created the taliban in afghanistan _meta_end_dot_

 prospect of a nuclear weapon falling into the hands of al qaida a threat far the deposed saddam hussein _meta_end_dot_

 nuclear warheads in the hands of jihadists in a country where _meta_percent_ref_ approve of osama _meta_end_dot_

 america may not be able to do anything from afghanistan to stop willful annihilation but i hazard to say it could do less without a mid east presence _meta_end_dot_

 and pakistan is a crazy little country compared to china with her supersized ambitions _meta_end_dot_

 imagine the panic should china not get the fuel needed to keep its economic engine humming _meta_end_dot_

 forget for a moment american s cries of despair at being deprived of cheap consumer products the bigger problem would be an unstable country armed to the teeth _meta_end_dot_

 don t forget israel either _meta_end_dot_

 like tawain israel is a freedom loving democracy and america is about democracy building remember _meta_end_question_

 as shaky as that idea may be as a long term solution to extremist middle east regime problems there is one democracy that thrives over there _meta_end_dot_

 should that country be abandoned _meta_end_question_

 oh yeah there s this other little thing called oil _meta_end_dot_

 i never have understood what s so upsetting about trading a little blood for a lot of oil _meta_end_dot_

 if china japan europe and america come to a screeching halt economically the next step would be inevitably war _meta_end_dot_

 and there would be a whole lot more blood spilled _meta_end_dot_

 the whole world is entertwined in ways that could have never been imagined during the world war ii era _meta_end_dot_

 the internet reflects a world interconnected _meta_end_dot_

 our fate rests in the middle east as much as any other country s _meta_end_dot_

 the jihadists hate freedom _meta_end_dot_

 they hate life _meta_end_dot_

 they believe they have a holy mission _meta_end_dot_

 if pakistan crumbles if iran arms if afghanistan turns back to the taliban if china becomes aggressive if russia presses if if if the free people of the world have big problems _meta_end_dot_

 america is in the middle east because well isn t it obvious _meta_end_question_
