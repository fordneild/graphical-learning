  at the rate barack obama is going his lack of qualification to serve as commander in chief of the u s _meta_end_dot_

 armed forces will be painfully obvious long before november _meta_end_dot_

 the man has far too few carefully considered opinions and far too many shoot from the hip and hope it sounds good opinions _meta_end_dot_

 unfortunately that weakness seems to be shared by the advisors with whom obama has surrounded himself _meta_end_dot_

 obama s latest pronouncements on iraq are a good example of the problem _meta_end_dot_

 from james taranto at wsj s best of the web emphasis added cut and run and then run back with hillary clinton being written off perhaps prematurely the eight month general election campaign between john mccain and barack obama seems to be getting under way _meta_end_dot_

 obama apparently moving to the right is now threatening military intervention in iraq after years of demanding america s immediate surrender _meta_end_dot_

 as the associated press reports mccain criticized obama for saying in tuesday night s democratic debate that after u s _meta_end_dot_

 troops were withdrawn as president he would act if al qaida is forming a base in iraq i have some news _meta_end_dot_

 al qaida is in iraq _meta_end_dot_

 it s called al qaida in iraq mccain told a crowd in tyler texas drawing laughter at obama s expense _meta_end_dot_

 he said obama s statement was pretty remarkable quips glenn reynolds in obama s defense he probably reads the new york times which always calls it al qaida in mesopotamia that may have confused him obama s response to mccain described in the same ap dispatch makes even less sense i do know that al qaida is in iraq and that s why i have said we should continue to strike al qaida targets he told a rally at ohio state university in columbus _meta_end_dot_

 but i have some news for john mccain obama added _meta_end_dot_

 there was no such thing as al qaida in iraq until george bush and john mccain decided to invade iraq _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 they took their eye off the people who were responsible for _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ and that would be al qaida in afghanistan that is stronger now than at any time since _meta_number_ref_ obama said he intended to withdraw u s _meta_end_dot_

 forces from iraq so we actually start going after al qaida in afghanistan and in the hills of pakistan like we should have been doing in the first place so let s see if we have this straight _meta_end_dot_

 al qaeda in iraq isn t worth fighting because it wouldn t be there if it weren t for bush and mccain _meta_end_dot_

 obama is going to pull all u s _meta_end_dot_

 troops out of iraq to go fight in afghanistan and pakistan although he will send them back to iraq if al qaeda are there even though he now wants to withdraw notwithstanding al qaeda s presence _meta_end_dot_

 yes we can _meta_end_exclamation_

 so obama s position on the iraq war the major public issue of the day on which he has staked hs campaign and his credibility is to pull america s troops out of iraq right away abandoning the country to al qaeda only to have america s troops fight their way back in to retake the same ground they previously won at a cost in human lives and then to someday withdraw the same troops again _meta_end_dot_

 pure folly _meta_end_dot_

 why doesn t obama show how easy it is to retake ground a second time by say giving up half his delegates won in the primaries _meta_end_question_

 he can always win them back if hillary clinton makes any inroads can t he _meta_end_question_

 yes we can _meta_end_exclamation_

 at this point i m not sure obama is qualified to coach a little league team _meta_end_dot_
