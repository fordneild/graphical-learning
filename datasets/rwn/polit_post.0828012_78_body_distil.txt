  the new york times reports the cutback in consumer spending when the final tally is in consumer spending for the quarter just ended will almost certainly shrink the first quarterly decline in nearly two decades _meta_end_dot_

 many economists who began the third quarter expecting modest growth now believe the cutbacks are so severe that the overall economy did not expand either and they warn that a consumer led recession could be more severe than the relatively mild one earlier this decade _meta_end_dot_

 ed the one that wasn t reported because clinton was president _meta_end_question_

 that one the last few days have devastated the american consumer said walter loeb president of loeb associates a consultancy who said he worried that the constant drumbeat of negative news about the economy was becoming a self fulfilling prophecy _meta_end_dot_

 they all feel poor hmmm i wonder why americans feel so poor _meta_end_question_

 it s not like the press hasn t been gleeful about a potential american economic implosion _meta_end_dot_

 hopefully americans are paying off debt _meta_end_dot_

 they ll spend more for christmas _meta_end_dot_

 they ll spend more if obama is elected because the press will glorify and edify his name and proclaim this appropriately subtitled in german _meta_end_dot_

 watch the whole thing groovy things are to come _meta_end_exclamation_

 and there will be no more tears and no more sorrow life is really really um really really really bad now but it will be so much better soon _meta_end_dot_

 hang on hippies salvation is nigh _meta_end_exclamation_

 update i m not sure that even the one cans save us from this _meta_end_dot_

 updated again comment from rrobin really melissa instead of acting like we re amused by this whole obama election travesty it s time to fight _meta_end_dot_

 it s long past the time to give ourselves the luxury of just playing with trolls around here _meta_end_dot_

 we can t just play while everything we hold dear just slips away _meta_end_dot_

 i m responding here because for some reason i can t comment _meta_end_dot_

 anyway to clarify i am not amused _meta_end_dot_

 at _meta_end_dot_

 all _meta_end_dot_

 in fact let me lay out the point of the post since i obviously didn t communicated clearly _meta_end_dot_

 the press has been a participant in the economic debacle _meta_end_dot_

 they decide what to print and how to print it and it makes a difference _meta_end_dot_

 journalistic integrity is a farce _meta_end_dot_

 had there been honest reporting the senate democrats despicable conduct regarding fannie mae and freddie mac failure would have been reported but it s demorcats so they get a pass _meta_end_dot_

 the american public has finally been informed about the mortgage crisis but most of the information is coming out after a trillion dollar spending bill passed that is not going to work and in fact further enables bad behavior _meta_end_dot_

 i am not amused _meta_end_dot_

 the press desires to put barack obama into the presidency so badly they will not give all the facts about obama so people can make an informed decision _meta_end_dot_

 i am not amused _meta_end_dot_

 congress democrats played around with the rescue bill played politics and packed the bill full of pork and acted like the asses they are with seeming indifference for the american economy because a bad economy favors obama don t you know _meta_end_question_

 they so desire power they will take the world economy down a freaking black hole to do it _meta_end_question_

 it s too late _meta_end_dot_

 no matter what happens the next four years are going to stink no matter how the press tries to spin it if obama is elected _meta_end_dot_

 with a mccain presidency the republicans will be tagged for a disaster that mccain himself tried to prevent oh and president bush too _meta_end_dot_

 but we don t hear about that because the press bias is so complete so egregious and so pathological _meta_end_dot_

 so no i m not amused _meta_end_dot_

 i m enraged _meta_end_dot_

 and now my blood pressure is up thanks _meta_end_exclamation_

 and what makes me even angrier is that we have a candidate who pussy foots around and won t name the problem because he s a senator who thinks he s better than everyone because he s part of the in gang _meta_end_dot_

 so no he won t go after his fellow senators because they are part of the same inbred elite problem _meta_end_dot_

 for mccain to have an ice cube s chance in hell at being elected he is going to have to lead _meta_end_dot_

 he is going to have to not come across as a mild mannered senatorial negotiator or focus on his maverickness _meta_end_dot_

 he s going to have to explain why his ideas are so much better and do it in a persuasive way _meta_end_dot_

 does he have it in him _meta_end_question_

 for all the press bias and for all the democrats willful destructiveness americans will respond to a positive rational optimistic message like the one that sarah palin articulates so well _meta_end_dot_

 coming from mccain it will have even more punch _meta_end_dot_

 he has the experience and hard earned stripes which is in stark contrast to obama s lack of experience on the one hand and his disturbing experience on the other _meta_end_dot_

 in this post i was attempting to demonstrate the press bias the collusion and delusion of the democrats and the real world consequences and also to show the foundation of obama s ideology _meta_end_dot_

 obama is a leftist socialist hippie clothed in a tie and wearing a bright smile _meta_end_dot_

 he is dangerous for america and must be defeated but he s viewed as a savior by his followers _meta_end_dot_

 just like the bailout they will find out too late that they ve been duped _meta_end_dot_

 or they ll be so invested in their perspective that they will follow wherever obama leads _meta_end_dot_

 and that s a frightening thought _meta_end_dot_
