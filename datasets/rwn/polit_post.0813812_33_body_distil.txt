  they just endorsed barack obama leaving a lot of hillary supporters and naral supporters furious _meta_end_dot_

 they re already feeling the backlash with the clock running down on a long fought primary naral pro choice america leaders sent state affiliates reeling this week by endorsing sen _meta_end_dot_

 barack obama of illinois _meta_end_dot_

 it was seen as a gratuitous slap in the face to a longtime ally and it sparked a fear even closer to home that the move will alienate donors loyal to sen _meta_end_dot_

 hillary rodham clinton of new york _meta_end_dot_

 many on this week s conference call were stunned on learning the news making urgent pleas for the group to remain neutral until after the june _meta_number_ref_ democratic primaries _meta_end_dot_

 it s created a firestorm said naral pro choice new york president kelli conlin who was on the conference call _meta_end_dot_

 everyone was mystified _meta_end_dot_

 saying what is the upside for the organization _meta_end_question_

 and frankly there was a lot of concern about the donor base _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 there was real concern there would be a backlash in washington two dozen women members of congress who support clinton held a quickly organized press conference to tout her abortion rights record wednesday night _meta_end_dot_

 ellen malcolm founder of the abortion rights women s fundraising group emily s list sharply rebuked naral for its endorsement _meta_end_dot_

 two former members of congress and clinton supporters geraldine ferraro and pat schroeder jabbed at naral for endorsing before the general election _meta_end_dot_

 looks like some higher ups at naral are trying to get jobs in the new administration _meta_end_dot_

 nothing else makes sense to us they wrote in a joint letter _meta_end_dot_

 edhad an idea naral picked the worst time to make an endorsement _meta_end_dot_

 instead of picking someone early they chose obama with just three weeks left to go before the end of the primaries _meta_end_dot_

 did they think they could help him in puerto rico or believe him in danger of losing the nomination _meta_end_question_

 what practical effect would their endorsement have on his ability to collect votes in the handful of contests remaining _meta_end_question_

 not much but obviously that wasn t their motivation _meta_end_dot_

 they wanted to send a message to hillary to get out of the race now rather than ride out the short string of primaries left _meta_end_dot_

 naral wants to show some muscle in the party s operations and doesn t mind throwing hillary under the bus to do so _meta_end_dot_

 instead they have enraged their base of women who have seen hillary as their champion both in this race and on the mission of naral itself and see her opponent as an obama come lately an ally but certainly not someone who has done the trench work that hillary has done over a long period of years _meta_end_dot_

 but hey who cares what their motives are _meta_end_question_

 this is great for me _meta_end_exclamation_

 let the chaos continue _meta_end_dot_

 anything that can further hillary s chances for winning the nomination is fantastic _meta_end_dot_

 way to go naral _meta_end_exclamation_
