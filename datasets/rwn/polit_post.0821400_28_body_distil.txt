  sarah steelman took the high road last night on the glenn beck show when describing how she stopped payment on a check meant to settle a sexual harassment case she did not mention gov _meta_end_dot_

 blunt s name in telling this story _meta_end_dot_

 her account starts about _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ seconds into the clip i recognize that this is a complicated issue and one that likely does not fall only on the shoulders of gov _meta_end_dot_

 blunt _meta_end_dot_

 i have spoken very highly of gov _meta_end_dot_

 blunt on many occasions and i will more in the future _meta_end_dot_

 i do however feel obligated to call particular attention to steelman s decision to go against the party for the sake of what s ethical and right _meta_end_dot_

 as steelman says in this excerpt from the show last night if something s right it s right for everybody sarah steelman has the sound judgment to know what s right for everybody _meta_end_dot_

 she has my vote and my financial support _meta_end_dot_

 i hope she ll have yours too _meta_end_dot_

 update let s back up for a second _meta_end_dot_

 i ll expand on this a little for any of you thinking who is sarah steelman or what in the world do sarah steelman and gov _meta_end_dot_

 matt blunt have to do with each other the short version is that sarah steelman and kenny hulshof are neck and neck in missouri right now competing against each other to be the republican candidate for governor _meta_end_dot_

 gov _meta_end_dot_

 blunt and his dad congressman roy blunt have both endorsed kenny hulshof _meta_end_dot_

 there is speculation that the only reason they endorsed hulshof over steelman is because they hold a grudge against her for canceling a check from gov _meta_end_dot_

 blunt s administration meant to settle a sexual harassment case against someone within blunt s administration _meta_end_dot_

 before i knew about this check situation i would have guessed that the blunts would certainly have endorsed sarah steelman _meta_end_dot_

 they both have solid reputations for sticking to their conservative principles and both have a great record for staying ahead of the curve when it comes to government transparency reaching out to new media and generally progressing in a way that the republican party can and should go _meta_end_dot_

 sarah steelman is the embodiment of the future of the republican party _meta_end_dot_

 she s willing to ruffle feathers a little even within her own party if it s what s right _meta_end_dot_

 update someone emailed me to tell me that gov _meta_end_dot_

 blunt asked the man involved in the sexual harassment case within his administration to step down _meta_end_dot_

 that move is to be commended no matter how you fall in this campaign _meta_end_dot_
