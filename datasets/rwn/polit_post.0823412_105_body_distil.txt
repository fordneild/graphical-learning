  the wsj connects the dots between obamenomics and military weakness given the hearty support democratic presidential candidate barack obama received in europe last month he must have noticed the surprise and skepticism among some germans when he asked that europeans contribute more for defense _meta_end_dot_

 many europeans argue they cannot afford such an additional expenditure _meta_end_dot_
