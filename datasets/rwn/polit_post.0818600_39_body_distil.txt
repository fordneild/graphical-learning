  last month on my blog i linked to jack shafer s article in slate declaring advantage michael crichton in _meta_number_ref_ novelist michael crichton riled the news business with a wired magazine essay titled mediasaurus in which he prophesied the death of the mass media specifically the new york times and the commercial networks _meta_end_dot_

 vanished without a trace he wrote _meta_end_dot_

 the mediasaurs had about a decade to live he wrote before technological advances artificial intelligence agents roaming the databases downloading stuff i am interested in and assembling for me a front page swept them under _meta_end_dot_

 shedding no tears crichton wrote that the shoddy mass media deserved its deadly fate _meta_end_dot_

 t he american media produce a product of very poor quality he lectured _meta_end_dot_

 its information is not reliable it has too much chrome and glitz its doors rattle it breaks down almost immediately and it s sold without warranty _meta_end_dot_

 it s flashy but it s basically junk as we pass his prediction s _meta_number_ref_ year anniversary i ve got to declare advantage crichton _meta_end_dot_

 rot afflicts the newspaper industry which is shedding staff circulation and revenues _meta_end_dot_

 it s gotten so bad in newspaperville that some people want google to buy the times and run it as a charity _meta_end_exclamation_

 evening news viewership continues to evaporate and while the mass media aren t going extinct tomorrow crichton s original observations about the media future now ring more true than false _meta_end_dot_

 ask any journalist _meta_end_dot_

 ever since dreaming up the silicon graffiti video series last year i had wanted to do a segment on alvin heidi toffler s third wave thesis particularly since i had taped their segment on c span s booknotes program in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 as i attempt to illustrate in the above video the clashing of a second wave industrial era institution like big media with the blogosphere a purely third wave phenomenon is one of the reasons in addition to an overwhelming and rarely acknowledged bias why old media are slowly going the way the dinosaurs and this is but one of many death rattles _meta_end_dot_

 fortunately as i noted in an earlier video segment they ve already built their own jurassic park _meta_end_exclamation_
