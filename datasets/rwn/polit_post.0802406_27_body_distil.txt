  my former employer duncan hunter who was very well received in the blogosphere despite not doing so well in the primaries has endorsed mike huckabee _meta_end_dot_

 some people are wondering why he chose huckabee _meta_end_dot_

 for example my buddy sarahk and i had an instant messenger conversation that went like so last night this has been edited a bit and she gave me permission to post sarahk dude _meta_end_dot_

 john hawkins hey yo _meta_end_dot_

 sarahk what in the world is hunter thinking endorsing huckabee _meta_end_question_

 john hawkins they re all pretty awful _meta_end_dot_

 trying to decide which candidate to endorse between these _meta_number_ref_ guys is like picking what type of animal crap you d like to shovel at the circus tomorrow _meta_end_dot_

 why not huckabee _meta_end_question_

 sarahk duncan hunter tough on immigration _meta_end_dot_

 huckabee people against illegal immigration hate brown people _meta_end_dot_

 sarahk oh well if huckabee says he ll be tough on illegal immigration as long as he signed a pledge i m sure he s trustworthy _meta_end_dot_

 john hawkins well all _meta_number_ref_ of them had exactly the same position in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 huckabee has a tough on illegal immigration plan now and he is probably more similar to duncan on trade than the other guys _meta_end_dot_

 on foreign policy huckabee comes across as a ditz but dunc probably figured his heart was in the right place _meta_end_dot_

 john hawkins yes it s going to be a long ugly year _meta_end_dot_

 sarahk i m going to cry a lot _meta_end_dot_

 ps here s duncan s statement i got to know governor hukcabee well on the campaign trail of the remaining candidates i feel that he is strongly committed to strengthening national defense constructing the border fence and meeting the challenge of china s emergence as a military superpower mike huckabee is a man of outstanding character and integrity _meta_end_dot_

 i saw that character over the last year of campaigning and was greatly impressed _meta_end_dot_

 the other republican candidates have many strengths and i wish them all well _meta_end_dot_

 my personal choice is mike huckabee let me add to that a bit _meta_end_dot_

 huckabee is anti amnesty and obviously duncan is as well _meta_end_dot_

 moreover duncan cares a great deal about trade issues and he and huckabee are much closer together on that issue than the other candidates _meta_end_dot_

 foreign policy wise truthfully there isn t much difference between any of the remaining candidates although admittedly huckabee comes across as a little spacy on that issue _meta_end_dot_

 additionally one thing a lot of people didn t realize is that duncan was one of the most socially conservative candidates in the race which was probably another point for huckabee _meta_end_dot_

 so when you put it all together and consider the weakness of the field as a whole i can certainly understand why duncan endorsed huckabee _meta_end_dot_
