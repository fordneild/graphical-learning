  i say not to huckabee but my opinion seems to be out of fashion with a chunk of christian conservatives _meta_end_dot_

 a few days ago i said that huckabee reminds me of jimmy carter jimmy carter wore his folksy unforgiving morality on his sleeve disguised as christianity when it was just a method to intimidate people of lesser moral stature anyone who disagreed with him _meta_end_dot_

 like carter huckabee loves government solutions _meta_end_dot_

 the government can make everything better he believes _meta_end_dot_

 that stands in stark contrast to the considerable evidence to the contrary _meta_end_dot_

 i consider myself christian conservative with a long libertarian streak _meta_end_dot_

 the religious talk tires me _meta_end_dot_

 it s not that it doesn t matter but i don t give a baboons butt that huckabee may or may not have a theology degree _meta_end_dot_

 it doesn t sway me at all _meta_end_dot_

 in fact it makes me more suspicious of him if anything _meta_end_dot_

 so in the last week or so other conservatives and even some moderates have expressed anti huckabee opinion s _meta_end_dot_

 but will the primary voters care _meta_end_question_

 and a commenter replied i m all for a humble president _meta_end_dot_

 i don t know much about huckabee but humility and folksiness reminds me of abraham lincoln _meta_end_dot_

 but maybe the era of that kind of president is long past _meta_end_dot_

 who really cares about the regular small people anymore _meta_end_question_

 i m a little worried that more than a few conservatives are worrying about the little guy _meta_end_dot_

 where did this come from _meta_end_question_

 it seems manifestly liberal to expect the government to solve our problems _meta_end_dot_

 it s one thing that bothered me about george w _meta_end_dot_

 bush s compassionate conservative as if it s a new thing that conservatives have compassion _meta_end_dot_

 compassion comes from believing that people are capable of making their own best decisions _meta_end_dot_

 the government has never struck me as very compassionate try to get your drivers license or medicaid bill taken care of _meta_end_dot_

 i m hoping that huckabee is this elections howard dean but i m afraid he might be the new jimmy carter _meta_end_dot_

 if you ll recall jimmy carter won the presidency and managed to a lot of damage in a short amount of time _meta_end_dot_

 please please let it not be huckabee _meta_end_dot_
