  barack obama s surrogates have been trying to convince the american people that his judgment is so impeccable that his lack of experience is irrelevant _meta_end_dot_

 however it s hard to make that case when the candidate in question is the single biggest gaffe machine to hit american politics since howard dean _meta_end_dot_

 you think joe biden cranks out a lot of dumb quips _meta_end_question_

 well biden is a rank amateur compared to obama _meta_end_dot_

 as you read these brainless comments keep in mind that the biggest challenge i had in creating this list was limiting it to only _meta_number_ref_ snafus _meta_end_dot_

 in fact there were so many of them that some of obama s most famous slip ups like i don t want them punished with a baby and why can t i just eat my waffle didn t even make the list _meta_end_dot_

 well let s get to it shall we _meta_end_question_

 first up here s the quotation that became the genesis of the obama is an elitist snob meme _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ anybody gone into whole foods lately and see what they charge for arugula _meta_end_question_

 i mean they re charging a lot of money for this stuff when the internet is afire with false rumors that you re a muslim do you really want to bizarrely reference your muslim faith _meta_number_ref_ let s not play games _meta_end_dot_

 i was suggesting you re absolutely right that john mccain has not talked about my muslim faith i wonder if abortion is above sarah palin s pay grade _meta_end_question_

 i think not _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ rick warren now let s deal with abortion _meta_number_ref_ million abortions since roe v _meta_end_dot_

 wade _meta_end_dot_

 as a pastor i have to deal with this all of the time all of the pain and all of the conflicts _meta_end_dot_

 i know this is a very complex issue _meta_end_dot_

 forty million abortions at what point does a baby get human rights in your view barack obama well you know i think that whether you re looking at it from a theological perspective or a scientific perspective answering that question with specificity you know is above my pay grade this part of obama s speech sounds like it was written for him by one of king canute s courtiers _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ i am absolutely certain that generations from now we will be able to look back and tell our children that this was the moment when we began to provide care for the sick and good jobs to the jobless this was the moment when the rise of the oceans began to slow and our planet began to heal this was the moment when we ended a war and secured our nation and restored our image as the last best hope on earth _meta_end_dot_

 this was the moment this was the time when we came together to remake this great nation so that it may always reflect our very best selves and our highest ideals whether this joke was about sarah palin or not it was a rather foolish line given that even his own supporters in the audience took it as a sexist jab at her expense _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ you can put lipstick on a pig but it s still a pig _meta_end_dot_

 you can wrap an old fish in a piece of paper called change it s still going to stink _meta_end_dot_

 after eight years we ve had enough of the same old thing _meta_end_dot_

 it s time to bring about real change to washington and that s the choice you ve got in this election as he tried to explain why he tossed his grandmother under the bus in a previous speech obama actually managed to make it worse by showing that he thinks of white people as a generic group not as individuals _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ the point i was making was not that grandmother harbors any racial animosity _meta_end_dot_

 she doesn t _meta_end_dot_

 but she is a typical white person dan quayle who was unfairly pilloried as a moron never said anything half as dumb as this _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ over the last _meta_number_ref_ months we ve traveled to every corner of the united states _meta_end_dot_

 i ve now been in _meta_number_ref_ states _meta_end_question_

 i think one left to go in his counterproductive race speech which was mistakenly praised as genius by his supporters in the media obama managed to cement his association to the racist anti american rantings of jeremiah wright while simultaneously coming across as remarkably callous towards his own grandmother _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ i can no more disown jeremiah wright than i can disown the black community _meta_end_dot_

 i can no more disown him than i can my white grandmother a woman who helped raise me a woman who sacrificed again and again for me a woman who loves me as much as she loves anything in this world but a woman who once confessed her fear of black men who passed by her on the street and who on more than one occasion has uttered racial or ethnic stereotypes that made me cringe it s no secret to people who pay attention that barack obama is not a patriotic man and he managed to unwittingly hammer that point home when he rather foolishly made a big deal about refusing to wear a flag pin anymore _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ you know the truth is that right after _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ i had a flag pin _meta_end_dot_

 shortly after _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ particularly because as we re talking about the iraq war that became a substitute for i think true patriotism which is speaking out on issues that are of importance to our national security i decided i won t wear that pin on my chest if you re from a small town and you re wondering what barack obama thinks of you this quote tells you everything you need to know and then some _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ you got into these small towns in pennsylvania and like a lot of small towns in the midwest the jobs have been gone now for _meta_number_ref_ years and nothing s replaced them _meta_end_dot_

 and they fell through the clinton administration and the bush administration and each successive administration has said that somehow these communities are gonna regenerate and they have not _meta_end_dot_

 and it s not surprising then they get bitter they cling to guns or religion or antipathy to people who aren t like them or anti immigrant sentiment or anti trade sentiment as a way to explain their frustrations
