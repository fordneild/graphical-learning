  but as obama becomes more hawkish on afghanistan the antiwar movement and democrats face a splintering process between those who want to militarily defeat the taliban the vote vets pac tom matzzie rand beers and his liberal national security network etc and nearly all the mainstream peace groups who believe that afghanistan and pakistan are deepening quagmires _meta_end_dot_

 obama s endorsement of a nato role for georgia will divide or alienate the rank and file even further tom hayden at the nation all the left s talk about pulling out of iraq so we focus on afghanistan _meta_end_question_

 as barry o _meta_end_dot_

 might say it s nothing but the old okie doke _meta_end_dot_

 in truth liberals haven t changed in decades _meta_end_dot_

 if it helps america s enemies they re for it _meta_end_dot_

 if it makes america safer they re against it _meta_end_dot_

 it s how they behaved during the cold war and it s how they re behaving during the war on terror _meta_end_dot_

 security measures at home _meta_end_question_

 they want those measures thwarted _meta_end_dot_

 the war in iraq _meta_end_question_

 they want to lose _meta_end_dot_

 the war in afghanistan _meta_end_question_

 they want to lose _meta_end_dot_

 it s a self destructive impulse that the left has that is every bit as instinctual as a lion s desire to eat meat or a cow s desire to eat grass and if barack obama gets in the white house it doesn t matter what he s saying today he will inevitably come around to the view of the mainstream peace groups who believe that afghanistan and pakistan are deepening quagmires
