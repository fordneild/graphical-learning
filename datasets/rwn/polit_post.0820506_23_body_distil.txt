  a note about the picture juxtaposition this is about artistic tone _meta_end_dot_

 the profile view _meta_end_dot_

 the serious expression _meta_end_dot_

 the shading _meta_end_dot_

 when i saw the obama flier picture my mind immediately called up this hitler image and i was struck by how similar they are in feel the color choice differences aside _meta_end_dot_

 unnerving really _meta_end_dot_

 patrick ruffini draws attention to the advertising and rally literature that is written in german _meta_end_dot_

 this action would be shocking but this is obama we re talking about _meta_end_dot_

 patrick says so this isn t just some sober high minded foreign policy speech part of a foreign trip occurring under the auspices of his official senate office _meta_end_dot_

 it is a campaign rally occuring on foreign soil _meta_end_dot_

 they are using the same tactics to turn out germans to an event as they would to any rally right here in america _meta_end_dot_

 this after obama s campaign said this it is not going to be a political speech said a senior foreign policy adviser who spoke to reporters on background _meta_end_dot_

 when the president of the united states goes and gives a speech it is not a political speech or a political rally _meta_end_dot_

 but he is not president of the united states a reporter reminded the adviser _meta_end_dot_

 the sea of germans drummed up by the obama campaign will be used as props to tell us americans how to vote and the campaign isn t trying to pretend otherwise _meta_end_dot_

 that s breathtakingly arrogant and par for the course for barack obama _meta_end_dot_

 and there is more about this stop _meta_end_dot_

 the guardian reports this the centrepiece of the european leg of obama s visit will be his berlin speech _meta_end_dot_

 liberal and conservative politicians in germany expressed consternation that obama plans to address the crowds from beneath the golden angel statue which graces berlin s siegess ule a landmark which hitler moved to its present location as part of his bid to transform berlin into the world capital germania _meta_end_dot_

 for him hitler it was the symbol of german supremacy and victory against denmark austria and france rainer br dele of the liberal fdp party told the bild am sonntag _meta_end_dot_

 it makes me wonder if barack obama was correctly advised in using the victory column as the location to talk on his vision for global cooperation cross posted at melissaclouthier com update update okay lefties you re getting on my nerves _meta_end_dot_

 i made no comparisons between hitler and obama unlike the open minded progressive nutroots have about president bush _meta_end_dot_

 my point was very specific and in context and called into questions obama s judgment about his advertising image and where and how he chooses to share his message _meta_end_dot_

 he is making a campaign stop in germany handing out german language campaign materials with disturbing imagery alluding to a former fascist leader and he is making this trip on the taxpayers dime as a senator _meta_end_dot_

 he is not president _meta_end_dot_

 he is a candidate _meta_end_dot_

 the way the mainstream press treats him it s no wonder he s confused about that _meta_end_dot_

 now let s get to how progressives have made the equivalence between bush and hitler _meta_end_dot_

 first a parody since lefties love arch humor so much the people s cube what _meta_end_question_

 not funny _meta_end_question_

 where s your sense of humor _meta_end_question_

 read about how bush became the new saddam oh _meta_end_exclamation_

 and here s the incisive commentary at democratic underground _meta_end_dot_

 in case subtlety is lost on you it s spelled out _meta_end_dot_

 don t forget the wack job conspiracy nuts who see the direct connection between bush and hitler _meta_end_dot_

 here s a quote you ll love from truthout it may not be nazi germany it might be a lot worse even more conspiracy wackiness but it all makes sense to the left _meta_end_dot_

 bush is ushering in the nazification of the world _meta_end_dot_

 kos gets in on it too _meta_end_dot_

 it s too much fun to compare bush to hitler to let the people in institutions write all the nastiness _meta_end_dot_

 want to explain why the left gets outraged when a point is made about the substance and form and context of an obama slogan style speech location etc _meta_end_dot_

 but it s okay for president bush to be directly compared to hitler in thought ideology intention and action and the conclusion is invariably that president bush is worse than hitler _meta_end_question_

 me thinks the left doth protest too much _meta_end_dot_
