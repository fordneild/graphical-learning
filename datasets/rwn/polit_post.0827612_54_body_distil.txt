  when people stop believing in god they don t believe in nothing they believe in anything g k _meta_end_dot_

 chesterton liberals hate religion because politics is a religion substitute for liberals and they can t stand the competition ann coulter conservatives have mocked the cult like atmosphere around the obama messiah but how do you even parody something like this column from maggie mertens called and i kid you not i will follow him obama as my personal jesus obama is my homeboy _meta_end_dot_

 and i m not saying that because he s black i m saying that in reference to those urban outfitters t shirts from a couple years ago that said jesus is my homeboy yes i just said it _meta_end_dot_

 obama is my jesus _meta_end_dot_

 while you may be overtly religious and find this to be idol worshipping or may be overtly politically correct and just know that everything in that sentence could be found offensive i m afraid it s true anyway _meta_end_dot_

 then i began to realize i wasn t the only one trying to buy a wwod bracelet and spending my weekends scouring cnn com _meta_end_dot_

 the rock star type love for obama wasn t just because he was pretty and in the media _meta_end_dot_

 others too had seen him as a shining light heard that mythical voice boom out over the mountaintops people were wearing the t shirt because they would rather wear something representing a politician than a pop star _meta_end_dot_

 people everywhere young and old were caring again _meta_end_dot_

 so what s the problem here _meta_end_question_

 i ve officially been saved and soon whether they like it or not the rest of the country will be too _meta_end_dot_

 i will follow him all the way to the white house and i ll be standing there in our nation s capital in january _meta_number_ref_ when barack obama is inaugurated as the _meta_number_ref_th president of the united states of america _meta_end_dot_

 in the name of obama amen _meta_end_dot_

 hey maggie let me give you and the other followers of the obamamessiah the best piece of advice you re ever going to get besides don t drink the kool aid barack is not jesus nor is he a particularly principled competent or decent man _meta_end_dot_

 he s a politician to the core and one who seems much more concerned with his own self aggrandizement than public service _meta_end_dot_

 if he gets into office it s highly likely that you will end up being as deeply disappointed in him as republicans are with george bush right now and in our defense we always thought bush was just another man in a profession that has ethical standards akin to those of a prostitute not the son of god _meta_end_dot_

 if you get what you want regrettably for the country i suspect the next four years are going to be very dark and disillusioning for you _meta_end_dot_

 hat tip to doubleplusundead for the story _meta_end_dot_
