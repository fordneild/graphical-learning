  i m all for creative anti democrat t shirts but this is a little much there are certain things that should be avoided in politics and one of them is jokes about assassinating people on the other side of the aisle _meta_end_dot_

 sure it may just be a goof but it s inappropriate given that every so often deranged people actually try to do this sort of thing see ted kaczynski and the loon who walked into a unitarian church and started shooting to name two examples _meta_end_dot_

 are they going to do it because they saw a t shirt _meta_end_question_

 no but t shirts like this do give some people the false impression that sort of thing is being winked at when it s actually almost universally condemned on the right and to a lesser extent on the left _meta_end_dot_
