 if you re going to be watching make sure to tune in refresh and check out the commentary and comments section while you watch _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ on the one hand this debate may be relatively dull because almost all of the other democratic debates have been dull _meta_end_dot_

 on the other hand since the wicked witch of new york is on the ropes you have to figure she s going to do everything short of throwing sand in obama s eyes and then hitting him in the knee with a pipe wrench to win _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ wow campbell brown is kind of cute _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ the glacier and the phony are hitting the stage _meta_end_dot_

 hillary is pro sick people got you _meta_end_exclamation_

 she also is taking a courageous stand on behalf of veterans _meta_end_dot_

 i m sure the anti veterans lobbies will be just outraged _meta_end_exclamation_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ barack wants to unify for change hooray _meta_end_exclamation_

 he also has people with some sad stories _meta_end_dot_

 like the lady who has to work hard and still can t afford health care for her sister _meta_end_dot_

 ehr why is she paying for health care for her sister _meta_end_question_

 wonder how barack stays so thin on the campaign trail _meta_end_question_

 could it be cocaine _meta_end_question_

 i think i heard the clinton campaign say he used to use cocaine _meta_end_dot_

 barack doesn t like special interests which ones and he is promising an america that s as good as its promise _meta_end_dot_

 ok that s an agenda _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ barack will just meet with the guy because he s a dope _meta_end_dot_

 dictators aren t interested in goofballs who repeat yes we can change and hope over and over _meta_end_dot_

 i wonder how much contempt our enemies would have for us if we put this guy in charge _meta_end_question_

 it would be like jimmy carter part _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ hillary responds eh she didn t score any points there with normal people although the libs in audience liked the shot at bush _meta_end_dot_

 chelsea looks foxy in the audience _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ barack doesn t think we stand above the rest of the world _meta_end_question_

 it s not a privilege to meet with the president of the us _meta_end_question_

 audience loves it but he sounds clueless _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ obama the economy has been in trouble for four years _meta_end_question_

 also if an area has been in economic trouble for decades isn t the problem with the area _meta_end_question_

 barack throws in a tax cut for people under _meta_number_ref_k _meta_end_dot_

 opposes lead paint on chinese toys _meta_end_dot_

 those are pluses for him _meta_end_dot_

 investing in solar wind and biodiesel will put people back to work _meta_end_question_

 geeze what s that a greenie fdr work problem he s suggesting _meta_end_question_

 ugh barack is going to form a coalition for change _meta_end_dot_

 how is barack going to do that _meta_end_question_

 he s the most liberal man in the senate _meta_end_dot_

 how often are republicans going to do that _meta_end_question_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ hillary a trade prosecutor _meta_end_dot_

 enforce trade agreements _meta_end_dot_

 we should definitely do that _meta_end_dot_

 tougher safety standards on imports free traders should be saying the same thing _meta_end_dot_

 ugh a moratorium on home foreclosures _meta_end_dot_

 it sucks to lose your home but that s life _meta_end_dot_

 you buy a house you can t afford you may lose it _meta_end_dot_

 freeze interest rates for _meta_number_ref_ years _meta_end_question_

 ugh _meta_end_exclamation_

 again here s hillary with the government job program _meta_end_dot_

 we ve got to end bush s non existent war on science _meta_end_exclamation_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ did hillary just say that she considers stopping enforcement of immigration laws until comprehensive immigration reform passes _meta_end_question_

 i think she did _meta_end_dot_

 not much enforcement talk lots of talk about amnesty _meta_end_dot_

 she would push an amnesty bill in her first _meta_number_ref_ days _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ barack we ve got to tone down the immigration rhetoric _meta_end_dot_

 no one is allowed to oppose amnesty apparently too hateful _meta_end_dot_

 in other words the bill that went down in flames back in _meta_number_ref_ hillary and obama love it except they think it s too soft _meta_end_dot_

 the legal immigration system does need to be fixed _meta_end_dot_

 we ve got to work with mexico to help them produce jobs like bush hasn t been bending over backwards to do that _meta_end_dot_

 bush has screwed that up does anyone believe that _meta_end_question_

 barack is not just going to fix the american economy he s going to fix the mexican economy too _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ she said the words bush and dumb in a sentence _meta_end_dot_

 har har har _meta_end_exclamation_

 hillary does not want to answer this question _meta_end_dot_

 it s pander to hispanics in texas vs _meta_end_dot_

 committing electoral suicide in the general election _meta_end_dot_

 hillary wants to listen to people along the border never answers the question _meta_end_dot_

 follow up because she didn t answer _meta_end_dot_

 hillary goes on to smart fencing _meta_end_dot_

 why how dare bush actually try to build the fence _meta_end_exclamation_

 hillary sounds like she doesn t want an actual fence she wants a smart fence everywhere _meta_end_dot_

 no real answer though _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ barack there may be some areas where it makes sense to do some fencing they re really lining up not to build the fence _meta_end_dot_

 it s fairness and justice to just allow every illegal alien to become a citizen _meta_end_dot_

 geeze amazing as it may be john mccain is actually to the right of these two clowns on illegal immigration _meta_end_dot_

 pass the dream act to allow illegal aliens to go to school here on the taxpayer dime _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ is there a downside for america becoming a bilingual nation _meta_end_question_

 hillary english needs to be our common unifying language _meta_end_dot_

 even she s not willing to pander that much _meta_end_dot_

 she is adamantly against making english the official language _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ barack is turning into total mush on this _meta_end_dot_

 we should encourage every child to speak two languages _meta_end_dot_

 don t we already try to do that _meta_end_question_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ commercial break as per usual hillary who has no charisma and barack who is supposed to be the most charismatic man on earth are running about even in the debate hillary is ahead by a nose maybe _meta_end_dot_

 so far i am a little surprised because hillary hasn t taken a single significant shot at bambi so far _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ hillary are you saying your opponent is all hat and no cattle _meta_end_dot_

 she attacks bush instead of obama and then still waiting i am kind of surprised she isn t trying to take a chunk out of obama tonight _meta_end_dot_

 here we go one of senator obama s supporters was asked to name one accomplishment of obama and couldn t _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ barack is now talking _meta_number_ref_ years of service now he s taking credit for a bunch of things that he s only marginally connected with _meta_end_dot_

 he signed onto a few bills and he s talking about them as if he wrote them or was essentially responsible for their passing _meta_end_dot_

 obama hillary is saying my supporters are delusional and are being duped _meta_end_dot_

 boy is that on target _meta_end_dot_

 barack will inspire the american people and end all divisions and does anyone believe this _meta_end_question_

 he s the most liberal guy in the senate _meta_end_dot_

 how is he ever going to bring people together _meta_end_question_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ barack words matter i didn t plagarize anything _meta_end_dot_

 it s silly season _meta_end_dot_

 hillary looks vacant up there now _meta_end_dot_

 we ve got to surrender in iraq cut taxes didn t clinton promise that national service which ever pol says _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ hillary if your candidacy is going to be about words they should be your own words _meta_end_dot_

 this isn t change you can believe in it s change you can xerox _meta_end_dot_

 good lines _meta_end_exclamation_

 we have to unite the country around specific goals _meta_end_dot_

 we can t just say come together _meta_end_dot_

 ouch this kitten has claws _meta_end_exclamation_

 now she s blasting him on health care foreclosures _meta_end_dot_

 we ve got to do hard work not just bringing people together but overcoming entrenched opposition _meta_end_dot_

 hillary is talking up her health care program in _meta_number_ref_ which doesn t make a lot of sense since it failed and she s talking about getting people together to get things done _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ barack got pole axed there let s see if he has a decent response _meta_end_dot_

 he s getting into the weeds on health care _meta_end_dot_

 wonk stuff _meta_end_dot_

 he had no real response to the beat down hill laid on him except health care in _meta_number_ref_ she did it the wrong way _meta_end_dot_

 hillary did the health care behind closed doors _meta_end_dot_

 she blew it _meta_end_dot_

 we ve got to be open _meta_end_dot_

 weak response overall _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ going to commercial _meta_end_dot_

 hillary has now moved ahead after drawing blood there _meta_end_dot_

 ps where s that incredible charisma barack is supposed to have _meta_end_question_

 how come it so seldom shows up in these debates _meta_end_question_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ hillary i am ready to be commander in chief but let s get back into wonk stuff on health care _meta_end_dot_

 gah _meta_end_exclamation_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ now barack is back to wonk stuff on health care _meta_end_dot_

 sigh _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ blah blah health care blah blah _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ hillary i can be a good commander in chief _meta_end_dot_

 dodges the question about barack _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ barack i would be a great commander in chief _meta_end_exclamation_

 i wouldn t hesitate to strike our enemies unless they re in iraq where i will surrender to al qaeda _meta_end_dot_

 so if our troops didn t have enough equipment in afghanistan wouldn t that be because clinton didn t leave bush the material he needed _meta_end_question_

 i have better judgment because i opposed going into iraq _meta_end_dot_

 i have shown great judgment _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ iraq is clearly getting better will you admit it _meta_end_question_

 hillary no i won t admit it _meta_end_dot_

 blah blah blah _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ barack violence has been reduced _meta_end_dot_

 but it was a mistake to go in the first place so it s irrelevant _meta_end_dot_

 because i opposed the war in the first place i can better argue that we should do something dumb now when i have to debate mccain _meta_end_dot_

 it won t play out the way you suspect my friends _meta_end_dot_

 vets are victims _meta_end_exclamation_

 john mccain doesn t understand the economy _meta_end_exclamation_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ commercial break _meta_end_dot_

 now we re back to dull _meta_end_dot_

 i am ready for this to be over _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ you were responsible for _meta_number_ref_ million in earmarks _meta_end_dot_

 you won t say why _meta_end_dot_

 barack i did _meta_end_exclamation_

 i have put them all out there _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ hillary you got _meta_number_ref_ million in earmarks _meta_end_dot_

 mccain doesn t do any _meta_end_dot_

 what do you say _meta_end_question_

 does he have a better case to make than you _meta_end_question_

 why no _meta_end_exclamation_

 he supported the iraq war and the bush tax cuts _meta_end_dot_

 of course i can beat mccain on fiscal conservatism _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ hillary what if it comes down to super delegates _meta_end_question_

 we will be unified _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ primaries and caucuses should count for something _meta_end_dot_

 super delegates must go the way the voters do now that i am doing better with the voters _meta_end_dot_

 he would be arguing exactly the opposite thing if he were behind and thought he could win that way _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ final question _meta_end_exclamation_

 huzzah _meta_end_exclamation_

 talk about a moment of crisis that tested you _meta_end_dot_

 obama _meta_end_dot_

 name a single moment that tested you honest answer i ve led a charmed life _meta_end_dot_

 i snorted coke had fun and still became a senator _meta_end_dot_

 real answer community organized rough childhood dodge dodge dodge _meta_end_dot_

 i have cumulative experience _meta_end_dot_

 lame answer _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ everybody here knows i have lived through some crises and challenging moments _meta_end_dot_

 applause _meta_end_dot_

 how do you do it hillary _meta_end_question_

 how do you keep going _meta_end_question_

 why my life has been nothing compared to the people whom i meet _meta_end_dot_

 like military men _meta_end_dot_

 those guys have it tough _meta_end_dot_

 the hits i have taken are nothing compared to them _meta_end_dot_

 i have been blessed _meta_end_dot_

 i want others to have the same opportunities that i have _meta_end_dot_

 i am so honored to be here with barack obama _meta_end_dot_

 we re going to be fine no matter what happens _meta_end_dot_

 i just hope we can say the same about the american people _meta_end_dot_

 wow towering grand slam home run on that last question for hill _meta_end_dot_

 great way for her to end a debate _meta_end_dot_

 that s it _meta_end_exclamation_

 summary all in all the debate was a little dull and as per usual hillary and obama were closely matched and have very similar positions in general _meta_end_dot_

 however obama sounded a little more naive than hillary and she did splatter him on plagiarism in a line that will be much replayed and she had an absolutely awesome answer on the closing question _meta_end_dot_

 with that in mind the winner was hillary clinton and the loser was barack obama _meta_end_dot_

 who won the debate _meta_end_question_

 hillary clinton barack obama i didn t watch free polls from pollhost com
