  as things have steadily improved in iraq cough cough coincidentally cough cough the press has steadily gotten less interested in reporting what s happening _meta_end_dot_

 take a look at the numbers the number of embedded reporters in iraq has plummeted _meta_number_ref_ percent over the past nine months from _meta_number_ref_ in september _meta_number_ref_ to a low of _meta_number_ref_ in june as u s _meta_end_dot_

 troop casualties have plunged according to department of defense data analysis by cnsnews com staff writer kevin mooney _meta_end_dot_

 u s _meta_end_dot_

 casualties were down _meta_number_ref_ percent in may and _meta_number_ref_ percent in june from year ago numbers for example _meta_end_dot_

 the number of embedded reporters peaked in september _meta_number_ref_ the month gen _meta_end_dot_

 david petraeus testified in congress that the surge strategy was working and that violence was decreasing in the country _meta_end_dot_

 immediately following gen _meta_end_dot_

 petraeus testimony came the largest single month drop off in embedded reporters in october from _meta_number_ref_ to _meta_number_ref_ the liberals in the mainstream media fell all over themselves reporting bad news from iraq but now that the news has improved they re not so interested _meta_end_dot_

 now some people will justify that by saying if it bleeds it leads but that s just not good enough in this case _meta_end_dot_

 by over covering the bad news and then largely ignoring the good news the media has left a lot of americans with a false impression which is just the way the msm likes it _meta_end_dot_

 if they actually gave the improvement in iraq the attention it deserves the american people might recall that george bush john mccain and the gop largely supported the surge while the left including barack obama almost universally said it wouldn t work _meta_end_dot_

 the msm can t have that and thus they ve suddenly become as uninterested in reporting what s happening today as they were interested in reporting every negative detail when things weren t going as well _meta_end_dot_

 ps barack obama has no experience and is therefore running on his judgment _meta_end_dot_

 the fact that his judgment was so far off the mark about the surge really should create a lot of doubt about his competence to lead the country because after all if he has no experience and has no judgment what makes him fit to be president _meta_end_question_
