  original post at _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ pm est i m going to be on the jaz mckay show _meta_end_dot_

 click on stickam in the left corner to listen to the show _meta_end_dot_

 update also last night i was on the conservatives with attitude show _meta_end_dot_

 i thought i was a guest but michael illions roped me into co hosting d it runs about _meta_number_ref_ minutes _meta_end_dot_

 we talked with congressman jack kingston who has gotten some flack for pointing out that barack obama refuses to wear a flag pin or hold his hand over his heart for the star spangled banner _meta_end_dot_

 personally i thanked him for bringing the issue up because it s something that s being said by conservatives but the msm isn t giving it the attention it deserves _meta_end_dot_
