  despite being linked there i don t recall hearing of the freedom fighter s journal before today but that doesn t make it any less disturbing that this was written there on the _meta_number_ref_th i understand the ______ building is more than _meta_number_ref_ feet tall _meta_end_dot_

 at the time of my last recon i noticed easy access to the roof that would allow someone to leap to their death to the parking lot below _meta_end_dot_

 i m not an expert in these matters but if i recall from my physics classes in college at _meta_number_ref_ feet a falling object reaches a speed of about _meta_number_ref_ mph _meta_end_dot_

 this means that the falling man would hit the pavement at a speed great enough to cause instant death _meta_end_dot_

 i understand that over the years since the construction of this building several persons have died by jumping from this structure _meta_end_dot_

 i plan to make such a leap _meta_end_dot_

 i do this in memory of the several hundred victims on _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ who jumped off the world trade center as a means of avoiding burning to death and the over _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ american soldiers killed fighting islamofascism in iraq and afghanistan _meta_end_dot_

 a parallel reason is a protest against the american left and the democrat party who have stabbed the armed forces in the back in the early stages of what is shaping up to be the third world war _meta_end_dot_

 this is an excellent time to make a final statement a dying declaration about an event that resulted in my life being ruined _meta_end_dot_

 this is my imprisonment for an attempt on the life of president clinton in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 in truth i made no such attempt and i was convicted on the basis of lies told to the court by the u s _meta_end_dot_

 secret service and an edited audiotape _meta_end_dot_

 i have no way of knowing the dynamics behind my conviction but i suspect that it was done on the basis of personal advancement and political reasons on the part of certain individuals in the district federal court and secret service _meta_end_dot_

 in addition i would not rule out bill or hillary clinton being personally involved in my case based on their well known records of revenge against their opponents _meta_end_dot_

 i have no doubt the leftist media will spin my death as that of an insane man with few options left in life who killed himself in desperation _meta_end_dot_

 in fact the objective investigator will notice no signs of depression on my part the last months of my life _meta_end_dot_

 i would describe myself as an idealist _meta_end_dot_

 i know this is a personality strange to many people who would say such a person is unusual or crazy or a bit off the fact of the matter is that the actions of many people that were described as heroic happened because they were idealists who chose death rather than selling out what they hold to be sacred _meta_end_dot_

 in my case i cannot allow myself to continue to live in a world that is largely indifferent to a neo pagan religion called islam that in league with leftist appeasement and multiculturalism and seems on the fast track to destroy the united states and western civilization _meta_end_dot_

 what i did is not suicide _meta_end_dot_

 it is the action of a patriot and idealist who loves god and country and who makes a very public statement as a warning of a new dark age that looks america straight in the face armed with a hideous ideology that makes the german nazis or russian communists look like bleeding heart liberals _meta_end_dot_

 i hope my fellow countrymen will rally once gain in the defense of liberty no matter how long and hard the struggle _meta_end_dot_

 in this life or death struggle between civilizations it would be a critical mistake to limit our attentions to the plight of isolated individuals whom islamic militants have threatened with death the sort of mistake that leads to a law enforcement attitude toward islam powered violence _meta_end_dot_

 the qur an commands muslims to impose themselves on the whole world by any means expedient _meta_end_dot_

 muhammad s recorded history and sayings reinforce that command _meta_end_dot_

 islamic militants believe that god and his prophet have commanded them to erect a totalitarian world girdling islamic state _meta_end_dot_

 if the last few years have taught us anything it s that there are enough adequately motivated muslims in any of the countries of europe to reduce those countries to chaos or shari a as long as islamic militancy is regarded as a law enforcement issue which means as long as islam is welcomed in the nations of the west _meta_end_dot_

 this cannot be a law enforcement issue _meta_end_dot_

 it must become a war issue _meta_end_dot_

 muslims as individuals might well be overwhelmingly inclined toward peace and amicable relations with non muslims though given the sanctification by islam of taqiyya and kitman one can never be perfectly sure _meta_end_dot_

 but islam the ideology is inherently and openly at war with any nation that refuses it _meta_end_dot_

 barring extraordinary good fortune such as america had with the fort dix six militant islam s active agents cannot reliably be seined from their concealment until they ve struck _meta_end_dot_

 to allow them to roam among us yet safeguard ourselves from them proactively we would have to erect a totalitarianism that would make oceania in _meta_number_ref_ look like a kindergarten class picnic _meta_end_dot_

 we must accept that we re on a war footing and do what a people at war must do to survive expel our putative enemies from among us and confine them where they can do us no further harm _meta_end_dot_

 europe s policy has been the reverse _meta_end_dot_

 india s policy has been inanition _meta_end_dot_

 america s policy defies elucidation _meta_end_dot_

 this cannot continue if we wish to survive as free men _meta_end_dot_

 quarantine or genocide _meta_end_dot_

 there are no other options _meta_end_dot_

 is this the real deal _meta_end_question_

 maybe _meta_end_dot_

 from the cleveland plain dealer ronald barbour age _meta_number_ref_ passed away feb _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 beloved son of marleen nee puckett and the late ronald father of brandy szachkas dear brother of deborah phillips douglas robin lynn barbour michael w richard alan teri and tonya phillips rodney loving uncle of _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 funeral service sunday feb _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ in the coreno funeral home _meta_number_ref_ lorain ave _meta_end_dot_

 at _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ pm _meta_end_dot_

 family will receive friends sunday _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ and _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ pm _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ however i noticed that according to his profile the ronald barbour that runs this blog is _meta_number_ref_ years old not _meta_number_ref_ and he is supposed to live in orlando florida not cleveland _meta_end_dot_

 if it is the same guy geeze what a tragic waste of life this is _meta_end_dot_

 if not i really hope that he ll reconsider _meta_end_dot_

 life is just too precious to waste merely to make a political point _meta_end_dot_

 sure it could be a hoax of some sort as well but as ted kennedy might say i think it s better to cross that bridge if we come to it _meta_end_dot_

 ps what s this _meta_end_question_

 hat tip to free republic for the story _meta_end_dot_
