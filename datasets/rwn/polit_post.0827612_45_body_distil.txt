  the first poll i did on the bailout was put out prior to the bill failing in the house and the stock market doing its best trampoline impression as a result _meta_end_dot_

 so i decided to do another poll to see if anybody s mind had changed as a result _meta_end_dot_

 the initial poll results had _meta_percent_ref_ of rwn s readers opposing the bailout and _meta_percent_ref_ supporting it _meta_end_dot_

 yesterday s poll results had drumroll please _meta_percent_ref_ of rwn s readers opposing the bailout and _meta_percent_ref_ supporting it _meta_end_dot_

 just a piece of advice for the republicans including john mccain who are supporting this bill welcome to political hell _meta_end_dot_

 your lack of political courage put you here _meta_end_dot_

 good luck getting out before the elections _meta_end_dot_

 you ll need it _meta_end_dot_

 ps i don t like seeing the gop get itself into this position but they re doing it to themselves _meta_end_dot_

 at some point they ve just got to realize that if they keep feeding the people who put them in washington crap sandwiches they re not going to keep getting invited to picnics _meta_end_dot_
