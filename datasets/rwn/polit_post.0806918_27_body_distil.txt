  friday i asked a question about brett favre s public melt down during his retirement announcement press conference _meta_end_dot_

 see video here _meta_end_dot_

 did favre s tears indicate a feminization of the culture _meta_end_question_

 i took a poll of my readers and while not scientific over _meta_percent_ref_ of them believed it wasn t a big deal at all that favre cried crocodile tears _meta_end_dot_

 in fact they felt it displayed a refreshing sensitivity _meta_end_dot_

 my feeling _meta_end_question_

 get a hold of yourself man brett favre reached the pinnacle of his career _meta_end_dot_

 he left at the top _meta_end_dot_

 i would have liked to see him go all the way and be the one who kicked tom brady s ass but oh well that didn t happen _meta_end_dot_

 he had a fantastic season anyway _meta_end_dot_

 after this season it seemed like the perfect time to retire _meta_end_dot_

 he has been banged up and quarterbacks get their bells rung so often brain damage seems like too big a price to pay for the sport at a certain point _meta_end_dot_

 it was no surprise to me when i heard the news _meta_end_dot_

 what did surprise me is that this manly man came undone during his press conference _meta_end_dot_

 what the hell _meta_end_question_

 after his father died he endured it with stoic grace and played anyway _meta_end_dot_

 and won by the way _meta_end_dot_

 but his sobbing for himself at the press conference seemed narcissistic and out of proportion _meta_end_dot_

 he is retiring after playing a game _meta_end_dot_

 no one died _meta_end_dot_

 his child isn t sick _meta_end_dot_

 there was no tragedy _meta_end_dot_

 his beloved obviously career ended on a high note _meta_end_dot_

 what more could a person want _meta_end_question_

 i liked it better when men kept a tight upper lip _meta_end_dot_

 women too _meta_end_dot_

 queen elizabeth ii s stoicism impresses me _meta_end_dot_

 i like that ilk of leader _meta_end_dot_

 restrained dignified and intense in feeling but not expression _meta_end_dot_

 i just don t want to see leaders cry any leaders male or female _meta_end_dot_

 i don t want to see hillary clinton cry _meta_end_dot_

 i don t want to see george w _meta_end_dot_

 bush cry _meta_end_dot_

 i want to see people suck it up and soldier on with grace _meta_end_dot_

 the culture has changed _meta_end_dot_

 americans seem so unacquainted with real tragedy that it is normal to emote over relatively trivial things _meta_end_dot_

 it seems that american men and women have gone soft _meta_end_dot_

 cry for a fallen soldier _meta_end_dot_

 cry for cancer _meta_end_dot_

 cry for the death of your child _meta_end_dot_

 some feel that the culture has been feminized _meta_end_dot_

 that the only virtues extolled are feminine _meta_end_dot_

 but what is virtuous about sappy tears _meta_end_question_

 how does crying puddles and displaying vulnerability publicly denote a good thing _meta_end_question_

 when nancy pelosi self indulgently surrounded herself with her grandchildren on the senate floor i wanted to barf _meta_end_dot_

 when hillary got choked up over her own relatively minor struggles during this campaign it felt just icky _meta_end_dot_

 grown women acting like sappy little girls is bad enough _meta_end_dot_

 seeing a man boo hoo is even worse _meta_end_dot_

 will any one extol typically masculine traits anymore _meta_end_question_

 i see it as how far we ve declined that a modern gladiator weeps publicly at his retirement _meta_end_dot_

 tom hanks said there s no crying in baseball well there s no crying in football either _meta_end_dot_

 it s a sport _meta_end_dot_

 man up _meta_end_exclamation_

 cross posted at dr _meta_end_dot_

 melissa clouthier where i m also talking about what s wrong with public schools _meta_end_dot_
