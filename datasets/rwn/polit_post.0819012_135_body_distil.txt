  if you believe that the expansion of government and deficit spending are serious issues then there almost could not be a starker difference between the two candidates for president _meta_end_dot_

 from the la times among other proposals during the course of the campaign obama has said he would strengthen the nation s bridges and dams _meta_dollor_ref_ billion a year help make men better fathers _meta_dollor_ref_ million a year and aid iraqis displaced by the war _meta_dollor_ref_ billion in one time spending _meta_end_dot_

 last week he pledged to give religious and community groups _meta_dollor_ref_ million a year to provide summer education to low income children _meta_end_dot_

 other proposals are more costly _meta_end_dot_

 obama wants to extend health insurance to more people part of a _meta_dollor_ref_ billion a year health plan develop cleaner energy sources _meta_dollor_ref_ billion a year curb home foreclosures _meta_dollor_ref_ billion in one time spending and add _meta_dollor_ref_ billion a year to education spending _meta_end_dot_

 it is a far different blueprint than mccain is offering _meta_end_dot_

 the senator from arizona has proposed relatively little new spending arguing that tax cuts and private business are more effective means of solving problems _meta_end_dot_

 the total price tag of obama s plans according to his campaign is _meta_dollor_ref_ billion a year _meta_end_dot_

 on top of that obama is proposing a middle class tax cut of about _meta_dollor_ref_ billion a year _meta_end_dot_

 obama s campaign says the new spending would be more than offset by cuts to existing federal programs and other savings _meta_end_dot_

 his plan reallocates what we re spending today on the war in iraq and wasteful and low priority government programs into higher priority investments in our future said jason furman obama s economic policy director _meta_end_dot_

 given the nature of how the price tags for government programs almost always dramatically expand if obama is saying he is proposing _meta_dollor_ref_ billion a year in new spending you can safely assume the initial amount is somewhere around _meta_dollor_ref_ billion and rising _meta_end_dot_

 then there s mccain who has one of the best records of fiscal conservatism in the senate and who has proposed relatively little new spending controlling spending is like securing the borders _meta_end_dot_

 every politician says that they want to do it but then when it comes right down to it you find that most of them don t believe what they say _meta_end_dot_

 given that he s proposing all that new spending obama certainly isn t going to cut the deficit _meta_end_dot_

 on the other hand mccain is promising to balance the budget in four years and he has proven time and time again that he will walk the walk on this issue _meta_end_dot_

 so which politician is more likely to make a change for the better on spending _meta_end_question_

 hint it s not the guy who keeps repeating change over and over like a parrot _meta_end_dot_
