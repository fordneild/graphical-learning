  so i am off on friday and monday and then naturally last night as i am just getting ready to start updating at around _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ est i am unable to pull a web page _meta_end_dot_

 i pick up the phone call my provider and they tell me they re getting a bazillion calls and that they must be down _meta_end_dot_

 rather than waiting for them to get it fixed i decided to go to bed and get up at _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ am _meta_end_dot_

 well i get up at _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ am and my instant messenger works but i still can t get out on a browser _meta_end_dot_

 so once again i call tech support and after waiting for _meta_number_ref_ minutes at _meta_number_ref_ am i finally get through _meta_end_dot_

 the newbie i am talking to then tells me they are not having any problems in my area _meta_end_dot_

 i pointed out that they told me they were having problems last night _meta_end_dot_

 she says that they told me wrong _meta_end_dot_

 i ask her about the wait she says that was just happenstance _meta_end_dot_

 i asked her if she has had anybody else call in with problems like this _meta_end_dot_

 she said that she had and she fixed them _meta_end_dot_

 at that point i figured hey i am _meta_percent_ref_ certain she is a clueless drone who is shoveling me a line of a horse crap but let me give her a chance anyway so she takes me through all these changes including turning my firewall off which would be fine except that she didn t tell me to turn it back on and it doesn t automatically come back on most people wouldn t have known to go back and fix that _meta_end_dot_

 after _meta_number_ref_ minutes of useless fiddling around with my computer she tells me she can t fix it and she wants to send it up to a higher level of tech support _meta_end_dot_

 i ask her for a supervisor _meta_end_dot_

 she tells me that they re all on the phone with other people right now and they ll have to call me back which you know i am sure she would have told me that was how it always is when there is nothing wrong _meta_end_dot_

 anyway after i got off the phone i called someone else in my area had her try the net and she was having the exact same problem which of course meant it was on my isp s end _meta_end_dot_

 soon thereafter one of their tech guys called me we talked and worked back and forth he went back to the engineers and now it s fixed for everyone in the area _meta_end_dot_

 and that s why my first post of the day is at _meta_number_ref_ am _meta_end_dot_
