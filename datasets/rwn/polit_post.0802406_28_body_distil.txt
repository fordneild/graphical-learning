  i ll be liveblogging the gop debate tonight at _meta_number_ref_ pm est _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ ok almost time to rock and roll _meta_end_dot_

 the latest florida polls seem to show mccain and romney duking it out for the top spot with romney closing the gap and in some polls pulling ahead no doubt on the strength of fred s supporters who have came over to his side _meta_end_dot_

 giuliani is in third which isn t good enough to keep his campaign going _meta_end_dot_

 huckabee can survive a _meta_number_ref_th place finish but it will contribute to the sense that he s wounded and sinking _meta_end_dot_

 so big debate _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ oh boy ron paul gets to eat up precious minutes _meta_end_dot_

 he doesn t have a chance to win overall and is at _meta_percent_ref_ in florida _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ admittedly i haven t looked at mitt s plan or bush s plan in detail yet but mitt is doing a good job of selling his plan _meta_end_dot_

 on the other hand i don t support a stimulus plan at all _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ oh now mccain wants to make the bush tax cuts permanent _meta_end_dot_

 well better late than never i suppose _meta_end_dot_

 no pork barrel projects _meta_end_dot_

 cut the corporate tax rate _meta_end_dot_

 like it _meta_end_dot_

 allowing people to expense new people and equipment _meta_end_dot_

 sounds good _meta_end_dot_

 encourage savings good _meta_end_dot_

 restrain spending _meta_end_dot_

 mccain did a good of playing to his strengths there _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ rudy we need major tax cuts we need to encourage businesses to stay here _meta_end_dot_

 sarbanes oxley is overblown _meta_end_dot_

 this is a real change from the democrats who philosophy is more taxes the rich people screw everyone yada yada yada _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ where did russert get that quote from _meta_end_question_

 if mccain said that it sounds bad _meta_end_dot_

 on the other hand mccain sounds good on this _meta_end_dot_

 his sober approach sounds good on this although he s fudging a bit on the tax cutter issue _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ good for huckabee there not taking the bait and beating on romney _meta_end_dot_

 huckabee is speaking out against the stimulus package _meta_end_dot_

 who is being stimulating the most _meta_end_question_

 us or china _meta_end_question_

 i like it _meta_end_dot_

 mike on infrastructure _meta_end_dot_

 he has given a very different answer here than the other guys but i do like his answer and building roads with american products isn t the worst idea i have heard _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ mitt doesn t take the bait and attack rudy and mccain _meta_end_dot_

 good for him wait now he takes a shot at mccain _meta_end_dot_

 then he plays to his resume i am a private sector guy good good _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ mccain i am sure the people who had to pay mitt s fees looked at them at taxes _meta_end_dot_

 now mccain goes back to fiscal conservatism where he s really strong _meta_end_dot_

 also it is true that mccain would restrain spending _meta_end_dot_

 i will stop the pork barrel spending no more bridges to nowhere _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ this is one of the reasons ron paul is such a lousy candidate _meta_end_dot_

 he gets a question that is perfect for him right down his alley _meta_end_dot_

 then he s all over the map he s on the war he s ranting on monetary policy and empire _meta_end_dot_

 it should have been an a answer for ron paul and he turned it into a d because he is so incoherent _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ the moment rudy start talking about giving that check back half the audience probably rolled their eyes because they have heard it already a half dozen times _meta_end_dot_

 i think that s a large part of why he has bombed over the last month and a half or so _meta_end_dot_

 he always sounds so so so stale _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ mccain gives a good answer to a tough question _meta_end_dot_

 the democrats will raise taxes spending won t deal with entitlements _meta_end_dot_

 mccain will veto every big spending bills he will impose discipline _meta_end_dot_

 the democrats want tax and tax spend and spend and elect and elect _meta_end_dot_

 mccain sounds good on this _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ huckabee _meta_end_dot_

 i wasn t there or we wouldn t have screwed this up _meta_end_dot_

 the only guy at the un without a headset _meta_end_question_

 mike is talking about healthcare fuel schooling _meta_end_dot_

 trickle up impact when the economy _meta_end_dot_

 mike understands everybody not just the folks at the top _meta_end_dot_

 i guarantee you that the average person not a political junky would love the answer huckabee just gave and think he sounded more in touch _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ mitt when republicans act like democrats we lose _meta_end_dot_

 i m from outside of washington _meta_end_dot_

 i will fix entitlements immigration etc _meta_end_dot_

 mitt sounded great on that issue _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ rudy club for growth likes my plan _meta_end_dot_

 rudy has done this in a big economy _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ another magnificent question for paul and again he s sort of incoherent _meta_end_dot_

 once he got beyond the part that focused on his record of being against spending and tax cuts incoherent _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ mccain every military leader including petraeus says we can sustain it in iraq _meta_end_dot_

 we are succeeding in iraq _meta_end_dot_

 it s not how long we re there it s the casualties _meta_end_dot_

 very true _meta_end_dot_

 i can t stand mccain but the man radiates gravitas on spending on foreign policy _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ why would we need a draft to increase the size of the military _meta_end_question_

 it was much bigger that it is today in the eighties _meta_end_dot_

 mitt taking a shot at the democrats i like it _meta_end_dot_

 mitt the democrats made it clear that getting out war more important than winning _meta_end_dot_

 that s wrong _meta_end_dot_

 excellent mitt _meta_end_exclamation_

 mitt we must be successful _meta_end_dot_

 it s outrageous that the democrats are taking credit for success of the surge _meta_end_dot_

 general hillary clinton line was the best line of the debate tonight so far _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ i don t particularly like mccain beating up rumsfeld but it s a good political strategy _meta_end_dot_

 you attack bush people get angry _meta_end_dot_

 rumsfeld you can blame and get away with it _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ rudy slaps hillary _meta_end_dot_

 i liked it _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ paul is just factually wrong _meta_end_dot_

 al qaeda was in iraq before we went in there _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ huckabee we owe bush not scorn but thanks _meta_end_dot_

 when the president acted the country was united _meta_end_dot_

 but i hope we have the courage and resolve not to back away just because the polls say we should _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ mitt i supported it then i support it now but it wasn t well managed _meta_end_dot_

 good answer for mitt _meta_end_dot_

 he has done well tonight _meta_end_dot_

 the problem is mccain is so strong on foreign policy and fiscal conservatism that it s hard for anyone else up there to match up to him _meta_end_dot_

 yet we re _meta_number_ref_ minutes into an hour and half long debate and mccain hasn t really had to deal with his many many weaknesses _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ incidentally you notice how much more serious and realistic the discussion is here on the economy and the war _meta_end_question_

 the democrats sound like children compared to these guys except for ron paul _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ every one of these questions better be for john mccain _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ what a dumb question _meta_end_dot_

 it s not that tough and it s to rudy not mccain _meta_end_question_

 what is mitt thinking _meta_end_question_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ ok answer from rudy he sounds fine after he got done with the lame joke that he had to explain to everyone _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ mccain s turn and he goes after huckabee not romney _meta_end_question_

 i am scratching my head _meta_end_dot_

 i can t complain about the question tho _meta_end_dot_

 explain the fair tax huck _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ one problem with making the fair tax a central part of your economic policy is that _meta_number_ref_ it s extraordinarily difficult to explain _meta_number_ref_ it s impossible to pass it _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ it is not intuitive funny line about the pimps not being republicans from huck _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ ron paul gets a question and he asks one for mccain _meta_end_dot_

 good that somebody asked the guy something _meta_end_dot_

 what is this question _meta_end_question_

 what the hell has gone wrong with this question process _meta_end_question_

 great opportunities all squandered _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ maybe it s because of paul s speaking style or because i was typing but i didn t understand exactly what paul was talking about and judging by the filler response mccain gave i am not sure he understands what paul was talking about either _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ huckabee goes after romney with the only semi tough question of the bunch _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ mitt never sounds good when he s responding to being hit and this is no exception _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ now rudy is going after romney _meta_end_dot_

 why does no one have a question for mccain _meta_end_question_

 well rudy is more of a sly dog than i thought _meta_end_dot_

 he is trying to dog out mccain and then give the question to mitt _meta_end_dot_

 he s also asking a question that floridians will care about because it s a do or die state for him _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ mitt is tired of this question and moving on to health insurance _meta_end_dot_

 rudy tries to pin him on mandates _meta_end_dot_

 my eyes are glazing over during this answer _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ i am not sure if this answer is helping mccain in florida but i do at least like him shutting down a _meta_number_ref_ billion dollar plan _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ i am glad rudy isn t a global warming alarmist and that he talked about nuclear and clean coal before he got down to the near useless crap solar wind switchgrass etc _meta_end_dot_

 also has to be done in a positive manner _meta_end_dot_

 we can t let india and china run wild while we kill our economy _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ mccain s worships at the alter of the goracle _meta_end_dot_

 if we are wrong we hand our children a cleaner world and a lot more regulations and a less vibrant economy and a competitive disadvantage with other nations _meta_end_dot_

 ugh _meta_end_exclamation_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ awww come on these horse race questions are lame _meta_end_dot_

 that s not what they need to be debating _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ rudy we re going to come from behind and win _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ the republican party is going to have hold its nose and pick my son john mccain _meta_end_dot_

 good question _meta_end_exclamation_

 how can mccain unite the party together behind him _meta_end_question_

 mccain conservatives only care about radical islam and spending and no we re not concerned about climate change _meta_end_dot_

 since when is israel a big israel supporter _meta_end_question_

 mccain has a conservative record _meta_end_dot_

 pffft _meta_end_dot_

 oh yes that s what conservatives don t like about him because he went after abramhoff _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ mitt bill back in the white house with nothing today _meta_end_dot_

 heh _meta_end_dot_

 hillary is out of step with the american people _meta_end_dot_

 this is a good question for him and he is doing a good job of answering it _meta_end_dot_

 hillary is exactly what s wrong in washington _meta_end_dot_

 she s washington to the core _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_beep_ref_ _meta_end_exclamation_

 very good _meta_end_dot_

 mitt makes his pitch to the reagan coalition _meta_end_dot_

 very strong answer _meta_end_exclamation_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ mitt i ve raised more money than anyone else has _meta_end_dot_

 raised more _meta_end_dot_

 deft handling of the question by mitt _meta_end_dot_

 mitt no one can say you owe me because i spent so much of my own money _meta_end_dot_

 i am concerned about the country so i am spending my own money _meta_end_dot_

 mitt is on tonight _meta_end_dot_

 he displayed huckabee like skill in turning that around _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ now mitt gets a mormon question _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_percent_ref_ say a mormon can t unite the country _meta_end_dot_

 mitt doesn t buy that people will vote against him because he s mormon _meta_end_dot_

 people are unamerican who would vote against him for being a mormon _meta_end_dot_

 well that stopped his momentum _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ ron paul abolish social security _meta_end_exclamation_

 ok _meta_end_dot_

 paul doesn t want taxes on social security but he wants to abolish it _meta_end_question_

 there are old people gasping in horror and throwing away their paul bumper stickers all across florida right now _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ huck gets a laugh at mitt s expense _meta_end_dot_

 and huck s solution to the entitlement problem is the fair tax _meta_end_question_

 ehr he wants to stick to the fair tax and that s his plan _meta_end_question_

 uh _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ here s the honest truth we will end up raising the limit of social security because the democrats won t agree to anything without doing that _meta_end_dot_

 no raise taxes no anything else _meta_end_dot_

 someone should have the courage to say that _meta_end_dot_

 mitt s other suggestions are fine _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ i approve on running ads in spanish but rudy didn t do a great job of answering that question _meta_end_dot_

 on the cuban question rudy s answer was eh _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ heh _meta_end_dot_

 they re asking about norris saying he was too old _meta_end_dot_

 huck makes it funny in his response _meta_end_dot_

 huckabee says no mccain isn t too old _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ mccain i will send sylvester stallone to take out chuck norris _meta_end_dot_

 laughs _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ rudy gets a great chance to slap the new york times and doesn t get as good a line off as he could have _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ romney changes position with the wind _meta_end_dot_

 yeah true _meta_end_dot_

 he is the most disliked candidate of the group _meta_end_dot_

 it s because his campaign has been so negative _meta_end_dot_

 he runs negative ads constantly and they send negative releases on the other candidates from dusk until dawn _meta_end_dot_

 again romney repeats his shtick _meta_end_dot_

 he is almost always weak when he s hit _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ mccain s temper has been an issue for years _meta_end_dot_

 mccain gets a laugh _meta_end_dot_

 he is an incredibly thin skinned and cranky guy _meta_end_dot_

 mccain says some nice words about rudy _meta_end_dot_

 smart because when rudy goes out his people will probably go right over to rudy _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ huckabee always hammers question about his faith out of the ballpark and this is no exception _meta_end_dot_

 he s the christian that they re going after because of his faith but he ll stand up for his faith no matter what they say _meta_end_dot_

 very good question _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ another third party question for paul _meta_end_dot_

 they have asked him this a million times _meta_end_dot_

 oh yeah that s what people are saying those ron paul people believe too strictly in the constitution and freedom so we don t like him _meta_end_dot_

 that s the problem _meta_end_dot_

 what a tool _meta_end_dot_

 summary so so debate _meta_end_dot_

 a little dull and the questions were a little bit lame _meta_end_dot_

 ron paul loser _meta_percent_ref_ decent answer _meta_percent_ref_ rambling and crap as per usual _meta_end_dot_

 rudy giuliani the magic is gone _meta_end_dot_

 the confident funny rudy of the original debates is long gone _meta_end_dot_

 mike huckabee huckbee has slipped in the last few debates _meta_end_dot_

 he s not terrible and he still gets off a few funny lines but too much fair tax stuff and he was just a touch off _meta_end_dot_

 john mccain has a lot of gravitas on security issues and fiscal conservatism _meta_end_dot_

 shows energy and has a nice way about him _meta_end_dot_

 i generally think his performance in these debates are underrated _meta_end_dot_

 mitt romney winner mitt was very good tonight _meta_end_dot_

 he got off the best lines said a lot of things that were pleasing to the conservative ear and fortunately he didn t get beaten up a lot he s not very good on the defensive _meta_end_dot_

 this was a very good debate for mitt romney in a crucial debate before what looks to be a very close florida election _meta_end_dot_
