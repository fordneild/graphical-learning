  liberals tend to live in cloud cuckoo land where the average conservative is an evil nazi loving david duke who s hellbent on sticking them in a camp so that we can turn the us into a theocracy _meta_end_dot_

 meanwhile back in the real world there s very very little evidence to support these assertions _meta_end_dot_

 so the way liberals get around this is by claiming conservatives are speaking in code _meta_end_dot_

 no matter how clearly conservatives say what we mean and no matter how obvious our motives are liberals can always manage to come up with some bizarro world narrative to explain what conservatives really mean _meta_end_dot_

 for example the latest mccain ad the one takes a powerful and effective shot at obama s incredible arrogance the cult like nature of his campaign and whether he s qualified to be president _meta_end_dot_

 absurdly david gergen said that the ad was accusing obama of being uppity but believe it or not the netroots came up with an even wackier interpretation _meta_end_dot_

 according to some liberals mccain is actually accusing obama of being the anti christ _meta_end_dot_

 no seriously that s what they re saying _meta_end_dot_

 first off here s daily kos diarist soonerg the mccain campaign may be creating a belief that obama is a false messiah perhaps the anti christ himself _meta_end_dot_

 is there a real danger that right wing voters will make the correlation that mccain seems to be implying that obama is a messianic leader _meta_end_question_

 that he is a false messiah _meta_end_question_

 that barack hussein obama is actually the anti christ _meta_end_question_

 while he is accusing obama of using the race card is he sneaking the ultimate fear card through the back door _meta_end_question_

 how far of a stretch is it for fundamentalist americans to truly believe that a black liberal with a muslim name could be the spawn of satan himself _meta_end_question_

 having read the initial book in the left behind series myself and living in the heart of the bible belt i know the unfortunate truth _meta_end_dot_

 many ultra right wingers have already been preying upon this fear _meta_end_dot_

 now with this new attack mccain seems to be attempting to feed that monster _meta_end_dot_

 i gotta tell you j k _meta_end_dot_

 rowling has got nothing on these libs in the creativity department _meta_end_dot_

 sure she came up with harry potter muggles and quidditch but that doesn t compare to the sort of imagination it takes to accuse mccain of painting hopey mcchange as the anti christ _meta_end_dot_

 but wait there s more _meta_end_dot_

 discourse net actually matches the daily kos on their nutty anti christ claim and then ups the ante perhaps to most viewers this ad will seem like the political equivalent of scoring against yourself as much of it is about how wonderful obama is and the attack part involves a clumsy use of charlton heston _meta_end_dot_

 but there may be a very evil method to the madness soonerg at daily kos suggests that the point of the latest mccain ads is to depict obama as the anti christ _meta_end_dot_

 don t laugh _meta_end_dot_

 the first thing i thought of when i saw the ad was that it was a dog whistle call out to evangelicals who would be offended by obama s suggestion that a light will shine down upon you and inspire people to vote for him _meta_end_dot_

 but it could well be that other people will see it as a more direct appeal consider a google search for obama anti christ finds about _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ pages _meta_end_dot_

 in light of last week s attack on a unitarian church for being too liberal is it so far fetched to worry that some unhinged true believer may hear all this and decide he has a call to assassinate the anti christ _meta_end_question_

 it s perhaps fortunate that as one christian pastor put it to me via email the people who believe in the anti christ tend to believe that he she is too powerful for one person to take out with a _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ nevertheless mccain is playing with nuclear weapons here _meta_end_dot_

 it s despicable _meta_end_dot_

 yes so not only is mccain accusing obama of being the anti christ he s apparently doing it in hopes of getting b o _meta_end_dot_

 assassinated _meta_end_dot_

 see _meta_end_question_

 there s so much you can learn when you can read the conservative code _meta_end_dot_

 ps just as a side note discourse net says obama anti christ finds about _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ pages well mccain anti christ pulls up _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ pages so it s not as if this association is unique to bambi _meta_end_dot_
