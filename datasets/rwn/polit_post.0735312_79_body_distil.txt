  mike huckabee s latest ad should have been the least controversial ad of the campaign _meta_end_dot_

 that s because it doesn t cover any issues and it s just mike huckabee doing what he does best being warm and personable as he says that the christmas season should be about the birth of christ _meta_end_dot_

 i m sure this ad made for a nice contrast to the biting attacks that are being launched at huckabee _meta_number_ref_x_meta_number_ref_ by his rivals in the campaign _meta_end_dot_

 however there have been a lot of complaints over what has been called a floating cross in the ad _meta_end_dot_

 huckabee s response to that was if we are so politically correct in this country that a person can t say enough of the nonsense with the political attack ads could we pause for a few days and say merry christmas to each other then we re really really in trouble as a country huckabee said _meta_end_dot_

 catholic league president bill donahue said huckabee went beyond wishing people a joyous holiday _meta_end_dot_

 donahue said he was especially disturbed by the cross like image created by a white bookcase in the background of the ad saying he believed it was a subliminal message _meta_end_dot_

 what he s trying to say to the evangelicals in western iowa is i m the real thing donahue said tuesday on fox news channel s fox and friends _meta_end_dot_

 you know what sell yourself on your issues not on what your religion is huckabee said the bookshelf is just a bookshelf and shrugged off the controversy i will confess this if you play the spot backwards it says paul is dead _meta_end_dot_

 paul is dead he was joking about the beatles recording of the white album and the urban legend that if a portion of the album is played backwards the words paul is dead is heard a reference to the very much alive paul mccartney _meta_end_dot_

 two things _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ did huckabee know that there was a cross in the background when he did the video _meta_end_question_

 absolutely _meta_end_dot_

 did his team deliberately try to create that effect in the video _meta_end_question_

 absolutely _meta_end_dot_

 that s why they did the slow turn around the room to create the cross in the background for a few moments _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ incidentally _meta_number_ref_ reveals huckabee s biggest problem he has gotten to where he is because of his religious background and his charisma and he s hoping that will be enough to catapult him to victory in a divided field _meta_end_dot_

 he may be right about that but the constant religious references have the potential to be more detrimental to him at this point than helpful because they ve been so overdone that they re coming across as exploitive _meta_end_dot_

 most conservative voters do want a presidential candidate who is a christian but they don t want someone to become the candidate just because he s a christian _meta_end_dot_

 there has to be a little wider appeal there and huckabee would be wise to spend less time making religious references and more time trying to appeal to voters on foreign policy immigration and on issues of fiscal conservatism _meta_end_dot_

 if huckabee wants to seal the deal in a race this competitive he is going to have to expand his appeal and address the concerns people have about his electability in a general election about his being too soft and about his being a nannystater _meta_end_dot_

 at the moment he doesn t seem to be making a lot headway on that front _meta_end_dot_
