  yesterday i interviewed jonah goldberg about his new book liberal fascism the secret history of the american left from mussolini to the politics of meaning _meta_end_dot_

 what follows is a slightly edited transcript of our conversation _meta_end_dot_

 before we really get started give us the jonah goldberg definition of fascism _meta_end_dot_

 a short definition would simply be there s a longer definition in the book it s one word we give for a totalitarian religious impulse where everything has to go together where the state has to govern every aspect of society or at least direct every aspect of society towards some utopian end _meta_end_dot_

 something like that _meta_end_dot_

 it s a hard thing to define which is why it s important to define it better on paper which i do in the book _meta_end_dot_

 i think one of the things we get caught up with when we talk about fascism is that we think it is this incredibly unique thing and really it s just another name for a kind of socialism _meta_end_dot_

 fascism is socialism mussolini was a socialist the national socialists duh were socialists _meta_end_dot_

 instead what we ve done is turn fascism into this shorthand for evil _meta_end_dot_

 nazism was obviously evil and italian fascism was really really bad but fascism meant something else as well _meta_end_dot_

 take the word socialism _meta_end_dot_

 more people were rounded up put in camps and murdered in the name of socialism than were ever killed in the name of nazism or fascism and that s not even counting the national socialists of germany _meta_end_dot_

 mao killed _meta_number_ref_ million people in the name of socialism _meta_end_dot_

 stalin killed minimum _meta_number_ref_ million people in the name of socialism _meta_end_dot_

 but if i call you a socialist that s like i m saying you re misguided utopian idealistic or goofy but it doesn t mean i am calling you a genocidal murderer _meta_end_dot_

 but we do that with fascism where we just say it s sort of a codeword for evil _meta_end_dot_

 so part of the book explains that fascism isn t as exotic as you think it is it s really just a flowering of a different kind of socialism _meta_end_dot_

 one of the common arguments you see on the net between conservatives and liberals is whether the nazis were creatures of the left or right _meta_end_dot_

 what do you say _meta_end_question_

 i say they were indisputably a phenomenon of the left _meta_end_dot_

 now that said they certainly talked about themselves in ways that to the ear of a person living in _meta_number_ref_ sounds confusing _meta_end_dot_

 mussolini referred to himself as being on the right but what he meant by right was a right wing socialist _meta_end_dot_

 you have to remember stalin was calling trotsky a right winger back in those days _meta_end_dot_

 bukharin was put in one of stalin s show trials for being a right wing deviationist _meta_end_dot_

 he was a hard core left wing socialist _meta_end_dot_

 beyond that if you were a martian and you came to planet earth with a clipboard and you observed politics and history and you defined the left as statism collectivism hostility to classical liberalism hostility to traditional christianity and tradition generally and you defined the right at least in the anglo american sense as both traditionalism and limited government right _meta_end_question_

 i mean to me that seems to be a pretty good anatomical description of left and right _meta_end_dot_

 i have never ever ever heard anybody make a credible argument that by those standards nazism wasn t on the left _meta_end_dot_

 it s obviously so _meta_end_dot_

 i think we get too caught up in intellectual labels and buzzwords when it s obvious if you step back from the painting far enough where on the canvas the nazis belong _meta_end_dot_

 well if someone said to you jonah i m not sure i buy that so give me some of the most striking similarities between modern liberals and fascists like hitler and mussolini what would you tell them _meta_end_question_

 well i want to be careful and say up front _meta_end_dot_

 i understand they re not hitler we re not comparing hillary to goering _meta_end_dot_

 right _meta_end_dot_

 i am not playing the game that the left does _meta_end_dot_

 that said where to start putting aside the stuff like they re socialists hitler is lured into the german worker s party by a speech called by what means shall capitalism be destroyed putting aside the nazi party platform of _meta_number_ref_ which adolph hitler co writes which includes socialized medicine universal health care universal education guaranteed wages appropriation of the wealth of the rich an anti wal mart plank essentially where they go after big department stores putting aside all of the obvious economic similarities there is also the populism _meta_end_dot_

 the nazis insisted on speaking out for the little guy what fdr called the forgotten man at any rally if there was ever going to be an aristocrat or a wealthy person on the stage or anywhere near it they insisted on having at least one peasant farmer or factory hand on the stage too _meta_end_dot_

 they were deeply populist plus there are philosophical similarities which we still have _meta_end_dot_

 one of the central points of fascism is the cult of unity _meta_end_dot_

 this idea that and this is what i was getting at in the beginning with my definition of fascism that if everybody gets together if everybody holds hands and agrees to the national program to the progressive cause to what the movement dictates is right and good then we will be able to be delivered from history we will be delivered to a promised land a thousand year reich a communist world a perfect society a utopia the kingdom of heaven on earth that notion still runs straight through the heart of contemporary liberalism today _meta_end_dot_

 barack obama says on the stump that we can create a kingdom of heaven on earth _meta_end_dot_

 hillary clinton talks about how if we can just create this idealized village of hers that everyone will feel like they belong everything will be in the village nothing outside of the village _meta_end_dot_

 when barack obama is on the stump his whole point is that if we can just be unified public policy issues don t really matter what really matters is unity that sort of thing _meta_end_dot_

 there s also a sort of contempt for democratic values that also comes out of this unity thing _meta_end_dot_

 one of the most fascistic things that kids on college campuses say is that if you re not part of the solution you re part of the problem in other words there is no safe harbor _meta_end_dot_

 either you agree with where the movement wants to go or you are a problem and problems need to be solved by definition _meta_end_dot_

 you hear al gore say the time for discussion is over _meta_end_dot_

 you hear hillary clinton say constantly we need to move beyond our ideological disagreements beyond our partisan disagreements beyond political labels and the thing is in _meta_number_ref_ years in conservative punditry i have never heard someone say i don t believe in labels i think we need to move beyond our ideological differences and therefore i am going to abandon everything i believe and agree with you for the sake of unity people only say we need to move beyond ideology we need to put partisanship aside or the time for discussion is over when they want to tell you to shut up and get with their program _meta_end_dot_

 that is a fundamentally undemocratic quasi fascistic way of talking about politics _meta_end_dot_

 a lot of people get confused about how fascism was supposed to be militarism and militaristic well there s a lot of truth to that obviously but i think they misunderstand the point of militarism to a certain extent _meta_end_dot_

 what fascinated progressives and fascists alike about militarism was that it provided a means of mobilizing society _meta_end_dot_

 one of the central aspects of fascism is the need to create crisis so that everyone drops their opposition to any program and rallies around the state in unity _meta_end_dot_

 that s what militarism was useful for _meta_end_dot_

 now i flatly concede that today s liberals are not militaristic in the slightest but they are still calling for moral equivalents of war they want to call for a war on poverty a war on inequality the war on cancer _meta_end_dot_

 well jonah you say they re not militaristic at all but bill clinton went on a lot of peacekeeping missions and liberals seem much more generally willing than conservatives to use our troops for missions of that sort _meta_end_dot_

 i think that s right _meta_end_dot_

 there is this notion that you get from liberal foreign policy that comes straight out of wilsonianism that foreign adventure is only worthwhile when it s not in our natural interest _meta_end_dot_

 that s why haiti was important _meta_end_dot_

 that s why somalia was important _meta_end_dot_

 but the second something is in our national interest it s because halliburton wants us to do it _meta_end_dot_

 it s a weird mixture of idealism and cynicism _meta_end_dot_

 because we re the bad guys and it s a blame america first mentality whenever we do things that we need to do as a matter of realpolitik the left seems to have huge problems with it but whenever we do things that are purely altruistic it s our moral imperative to do it _meta_end_dot_

 i m sympathetic to the moral imperative stuff more than most people but i m more sympathetic to doing it if it s in our national interest _meta_end_dot_

 that comes first _meta_end_dot_

 i m all in favor of helping little old ladies who are being mugged by gangs _meta_end_dot_

 but i think it s even more imperative if the gang is mugging the little old lady and me that my first priority has to be to protect myself before i can do anything for anybody else _meta_end_dot_

 it s there where i think a lot of liberals fall down and think we shouldn t be doing anything in our national interest _meta_end_dot_

 now conservatives rather famously have a deep and abiding dislike and mistrust of the federal government and believe that private industry does almost everything better than the government does _meta_end_dot_

 is a belief like that ultimately compatible with fascism _meta_end_question_

 no the whole point of fascism is centralizing _meta_end_dot_

 that s why they were socialists _meta_end_dot_

 all these idiots who go around googling stuff on the web they find mussolini saying fascism is anti liberalism and anti liberal _meta_end_dot_

 well the liberalism that mussolini was talking about was manchester liberalism classical liberalism free market capitalistic individual rights liberalism _meta_end_dot_

 that is what the fascists stood against _meta_end_dot_

 it s a totalitarian society inherently hostile to private property _meta_end_dot_

 they believe the state was by far the best means of governing and running society _meta_end_dot_

 one of the things that prompted me to write the book was this fundamental misunderstanding of what conservatism is in america and this slander this projection where liberals see in themselves similarities to fascism and project those things on to us _meta_end_dot_

 i often like to ask college kids except for the murder bigotry and genocide what is it exactly about nazism that you don t like _meta_end_question_

 and they can t name anything _meta_end_dot_

 but conservatives can come up with all sorts of stuff _meta_end_dot_

 they were socialists _meta_end_dot_

 they wanted free health care _meta_end_dot_

 they hated christianity _meta_end_dot_

 they hated tradition _meta_end_dot_

 they were statists at the end of the day _meta_end_dot_

 all of those things are inherent to fascism and what was anathema to fascism was the idea that you can have what the scholars of totalitarian theory call islands of separateness that churches can go their own way that corporations can operate without coordinating with the state that individuals can have free consciences that there can be free debate free and open discussion _meta_end_dot_

 what the nazis implemented was something called the gleichschaltung which is a german word for coordination and the idea was that the entire society needed to work like a giant machine where all the cogs were linked together and everyone pushed in the same direction _meta_end_dot_

 here s a fascinating quote from your book that i d like you to expound on a bit what distinguished nazism from other brands of socialism and communism was not so much that it included more aspects from the political right though there were some _meta_end_dot_

 what distinguished nazism was that it forthrightly included a world view we now associate almost completely with the political left identity politics that s right _meta_end_dot_

 the nazis unlike the italian fascists and this is one of the key points people keep not wanting to hear italian fascism was not racist it was not anti semitic _meta_end_dot_

 it only became anti semitic when the nazis grew so powerful and the italians grew so weak that they had to cave in to nazi demands _meta_end_dot_

 they fought nazi demands tooth and nail about cooperating with the holocaust _meta_end_dot_

 the nazis believed in racial essentialism that the aryan race was unique was pure was special that there was no such thing as universal humanity _meta_end_dot_

 you know hitler had this long section in mein kampf where he concludes that jews aren t human beings that they re a different species _meta_end_dot_

 they talked constantly in the same way that we hear academics today talk about dead white european males white logic eurocentrism logocentrism and all these sorts of things _meta_end_dot_

 these ideas come straight out of the intellectual tradition that led to nazism that flourished under nazism and indeed the words deconstruction and logocentrism these all come out of the nazi intellectual project _meta_end_dot_

 what they believed fundamentally was that human beings could be categorized in little boxes and they could never escape from them _meta_end_dot_

 it was an iron cage of identity _meta_end_dot_

 today on the left we have people like richard delgado at the university of colorado who says that blacks and hispanics should flee the enlightenment as fast as they can because there is no way that the regime of white privilege could ever assimilate people who are born black or hispanic because you can never transcend your identity or your gender _meta_end_dot_

 it s where the whole logic of quotas come from it s where the whole logic of affirmative action comes from _meta_end_dot_

 it s the idea that black people think like black people and white people think like white people and therefore the only kind of diversity you can have is diversity by skin color gender and sexual orientation _meta_end_dot_

 the key distinction here though is that nazi philosophy was rankly evil in applying this _meta_end_dot_

 their quotas their approach to this sort of thing was flatly evil and exterminationist _meta_end_dot_

 that is not what the left wants to do today _meta_end_dot_

 they re much more benign _meta_end_dot_

 there s not a lot of love for jews on the hard left but their thinking is that they re trying to help the victims of discrimination they re trying to improve the lives of others _meta_end_dot_

 it s a nice sort of approach _meta_end_dot_

 it s a well intentioned approach _meta_end_dot_

 but it doesn t have nice consequences _meta_end_dot_

 i think it s bad for social harmony _meta_end_dot_

 it s bad for the people it s designed to help _meta_end_dot_

 moreover that sort of categorical thinking is very similar to the thinking we saw under the nazis _meta_end_dot_

 in ron radosh s review of your book he says turning to what he calls liberal racism mr _meta_end_dot_

 goldberg offers readers his finest chapter _meta_end_dot_

 it is a devastating picture of how liberals adopted eugenics a basic part of nazi doctrine talk about that a bit _meta_end_dot_

 sure _meta_end_dot_

 you often hear especially from the fringe feminist left that pro lifers are like nazis or fascistic because they want to oppress women i m perfectly willing to have an argument about pro life pro choice all that sort of thing and even though i might disagree with the pro choicers on most of their arguments i don t think it s inherently disqualifying to make a pro choice argument _meta_end_dot_

 but what is simply factually not the case is that the pro life position has anything to do with nazism _meta_end_dot_

 you would think that a half century after the holocaust it wouldn t be necessary to remind people that nazis weren t pro life _meta_end_dot_

 long before they started the campaign against the jews they started a massive euthanasia campaign killing what they called the useless bread gobblers what i think a lot of people don t appreciate and what has been pretty well established now in the historical literature is that the nazis were in many ways picking up on ideas that first flourished in the united states under the progressives _meta_end_dot_

 the progressives start the forced sterilizations _meta_end_dot_

 it is the progressives who talk about weeding out the inferior races _meta_end_dot_

 margaret sanger the founder of planned parenthood was all about weeding out the duskier and darker races and all of that _meta_end_dot_

 the socialists of britain the fabian socialists george bernard shaw hg wells all of those guys were soaked to the bone eugenicists who considered eugenics and socialism to be the same project _meta_end_dot_

 oliver wendell holmes the author of the bell case where the court ruled it was ok to forcibly sterilize low income whites because they were viewed as sort of sub par genetic filth that needed to be cleaned up oliver wendell holmes said the first priority of social reform was to build a race _meta_end_dot_

 there were plenty of eugenicists who wanted to create a genetic gulag archipelago _meta_end_dot_

 they were going to put inferior women in essentially these interior colonies during their fertile years so that they could not breed _meta_end_dot_

 the welfare state was in many senses a eugenic project _meta_end_dot_

 as one famous progressive put it his argument for the minimum wage was the cooley meaning the chinese worker cannot outwork the white man but he can under live him _meta_end_dot_

 the logic of that was that since these inferior races needed so little to live on if you created a minimum wage to lock them out they would sort of die out of their own accord because no employer in his right mind would hire anybody but a white man if he had to pay a white man s wage _meta_end_dot_

 that logic suffused the founding of the liberal welfare state _meta_end_dot_

 woodrow wilson when he was governor of new jersey he signed a eugenics sterilization law that appointed a eugenics minister for the state of new jersey who ended up being a doctor in one of the nazi concentration camps _meta_end_dot_

 do you think some of the things that now occur on college campuses school papers being deliberately trashed if they say something politically incorrect college republicans being persecuted for simply having different views conservative speakers being screamed over and attacked with food is reminiscent of fascist tactics _meta_end_question_

 of course it is _meta_end_dot_

 leading the charge of the nazi movement in the _meta_number_ref_s were student groups _meta_end_dot_

 the students far outpaced the rest of society in joining the nazi party _meta_end_dot_

 the nazi party was in many respects much like the italian fascist party a youth movement _meta_end_dot_

 they appealed to youth they claimed that they were the voice of the new generation you had students attacking the conservative teachers who wanted to maintain the traditional notion of a university _meta_end_dot_

 the students were demanding that buzzword we hear on college campuses today relevance you know why do we have to learn latin and greek and all these things _meta_end_question_

 why can t we learn about the progressive things of today _meta_end_question_

 all the protests that you saw on campuses were reminiscent of it _meta_end_dot_

 at the end of the day whether you want to call it communist tactics or fascist tactics or whatever any time you have people burning campus newspapers shouting down speakers mobbing the stage like you had at columbia those are undemocratic tactics those are totalitarian tactics those are mob rule tactics _meta_end_dot_

 the thing to remember about all of these isms of the left is that they are rationalizations for mob rule _meta_end_dot_

 if you were going to give people a _meta_number_ref_ second explanation of why they should buy your book what would you tell them _meta_end_question_

 the primary reason someone should buy my book is because it s the first book to put all in one place the stuff that is left out of the history books and the narrative that we ve heard for the last _meta_number_ref_ years _meta_end_dot_

 it corrects the record about the slander that has been aimed at conservatives for a half century that we are fascists that we are nazis _meta_end_dot_

 even if you disagree with a lot of the arguments i think most if not all fair minded readers will concede that they learned a lot from it _meta_end_dot_

 i am not winging it _meta_end_dot_

 every claim is backed up by facts by footnotes _meta_end_dot_

 every argument marshals evidence to support it _meta_end_dot_

 if you disagree with everything even if you think liberalism is still the best thing that we have for bettering society i think that you ll be better armed to make your case because you ll at least know the downside of your own intellectual history _meta_end_dot_

 you ll know the darker side of progressivism _meta_end_dot_

 in an age where hillary clinton is saying that she s a progressive i think it s pretty important to understand what progressivism was and what its ultimate aims and impulses are _meta_end_dot_

 do you regularly or semi regularly read any blogs you d like to recommend to rwn s readers _meta_end_question_

 i m not reading anything right now because of the book tour but all the obvious ones _meta_end_dot_

 the national review blogs the corner the campaign spot that kind of thing _meta_end_dot_

 i obviously check out instapundit and my mom s site lucianne _meta_end_dot_

 the problem is whenever i am asked this question i get in more trouble for the blogs that i don t mention than the ones that i do laughs _meta_end_dot_

 so ross douthat has always had some fascinating and interesting things to say _meta_end_dot_

 i think mickey kaus even though he s a liberal is the best guy out there at dissecting the really fine point stuff like how the new york times covers things _meta_end_dot_

 it s useful _meta_end_dot_

 i think bloggers do great stuff _meta_end_dot_

 well jonah thanks a lot _meta_end_dot_

 great i appreciate it _meta_end_exclamation_
