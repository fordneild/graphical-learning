  i dvr d the democratic convention and just finished watching it it was even worse than most of the democratic debates which is really saying something _meta_end_dot_

 here s a short review of the major events that happened _meta_number_ref_ they started with a pathetic piece that featured jimmy carter walking around new orleans bemoaning katrina which incidentally happened in august of _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 seriously jimmy carter perhaps the worst president of the last century hyping a bunch of people whining about something that happened _meta_number_ref_ years ago _meta_end_dot_

 what a horrible way to kick off prime time convention coverage _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ jesse jackson jr _meta_end_dot_

 got a prime time slot which doesn t make a lot of sense _meta_end_dot_

 he didn t say anything memorable obama already has black voters on board and anything associated with that parasite jesse jackson is likely to further turn off blue collar older white voters so what was the point _meta_end_question_

 _meta_number_ref_ ted kennedy on the one hand the opening for the convention was jimmy carter jesse jackson jr and ted kennedy that s not exactly a way to reassure middle america _meta_end_dot_

 on the other hand it was good to see kennedy up there since he has been sick _meta_end_dot_

 he looked good too but you could tell from the weakness in his voice that kennedy was sicker than he was letting on _meta_end_dot_

 kennedy gave a decent rousing speech _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ jim leach r who _meta_end_question_

 he was incredibly boring so much so that even the cnn announcers admitted it and the crowd chattered right through his speech _meta_end_dot_

 cnn also broke off for a commercial in the middle of his speech which tells you how exciting it was _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ claire mccaskill spoke and cnn didn t even bother to cover her _meta_end_dot_

 they talked right over her _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ michelle obama gave a solid b speech _meta_end_dot_

 she talked about family hard work said some generic things about barack s agenda and added a few nice things about her husband and even hillary _meta_end_dot_

 overall michelle s speech was her attempt to trick people into believing she s not a radical elitist liberal with a dislike for her own country and it was good for what it was _meta_end_dot_

 summary overall this was a poorly organized bomb _meta_end_dot_

 it gets a d grade and only michelle obama and ted kennedy saved it from being a complete and utter failure _meta_end_dot_

 you want to know how bad it was _meta_end_question_

 even james carville and david gergen were panning it _meta_end_dot_

 why was it so bad _meta_end_question_

 let us count the ways my friends _meta_end_dot_

 it was poorly organized had a lame group of speakers didn t hit any overriding themes didn t build barack up very much didn t fire up liberals didn t attack the gop it just did very little for the dems in any way shape or form beyond perhaps improving michelle obama s image a tad _meta_end_dot_

 most importantly if you look at the groups that the dems did not reach out to the most with this convention women blue collar whites and older whites there was very little here to hook them _meta_end_dot_

 on the upside for the dems the next _meta_number_ref_ nights of the convention will probably be better _meta_end_dot_

 on the downside the first night almost couldn t have been worse and they have now wasted the majority of their first night of coverage _meta_end_dot_

 ps if this were the republican convention john edwards was a republican how often would we be hearing about how his affair keeps him from attending _meta_end_question_

 i m guessing at least _meta_number_ref_ or _meta_number_ref_ times a night _meta_end_dot_

 cnn would probably even be showing it in their little cnn fact areas _meta_end_dot_
