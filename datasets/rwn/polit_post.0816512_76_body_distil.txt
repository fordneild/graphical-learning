  b illed as a centerist agenda chris bowers of open left lists the legislation that is certain to pass if obama wins the white house we pick up _meta_number_ref_ more seats in the house and _meta_number_ref_ more seats in the senate _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 harkin amendment to the farm bill _meta_end_dot_

 not sure what this is but it probably will pass when we get six more votes in the senate _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 lieberman warner climate security act _meta_end_dot_

 a centrist global warming bill that doesn t do much to stop global warming from what i have heard _meta_end_dot_

 bowers then describes this list and its supposed centerist agenda this way overall this is pretty much a wave of centrist legislation _meta_end_dot_

 we will give troops more time at home and withdraw about _meta_number_ref_ _meta_percent_ref_ of them from iraq but not all of them _meta_end_dot_

 we will expand health care but it won t be universal _meta_end_dot_

 we will restore some civil liberties but not all of them _meta_end_dot_

 we will get some immigration reform but not much _meta_end_dot_

 something will be done about sustainability in energy global warming and agriculture but nowhere near enough _meta_end_dot_

 so we are going to begin with a centrist template but at least we will have to fight to make all of these bits of legislation better _meta_end_dot_

 having even that opportunity will be a dramatic improvement _meta_end_dot_

 with bush in office and only _meta_number_ref_ senators right now progressive legislation is impossible _meta_end_dot_

 the idea obviously is to sell this as a centerist agenda when in fact it is an incremental liberal agenda _meta_end_dot_

 look at items _meta_number_ref_ and _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 with obama as president he could do both of those things without any action by congress _meta_end_dot_

 as commander in chief he can draw down the troops to those levels and he can direct there be minimum periods between deployments _meta_end_dot_

 that gives you an idea of how much congress has attempted to mess with the authority of the commander in chief _meta_end_dot_

 imagine if you will the outcry if a republican congress was attempting to mandate an increase in troops and a shorter time between deployments _meta_end_dot_

 what do you suppose the democratic argument would be if a democrat were in the white house _meta_end_question_

 _meta_number_ref_ and _meta_number_ref_ are boilerplate union pandering and more government intrusion and meddling in the affairs of business _meta_end_dot_

 pure payback for union support during this election _meta_end_dot_

 the employee free choice act of _meta_number_ref_ is particularly insidious and you need to read up on it _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ washington dc is represented in congress by the entire congress _meta_end_dot_

 it is a federal district _meta_end_dot_

 giving it a representative with a vote is tantamount to giving it the same rights as a state _meta_end_dot_

 it s not a state and thus shouldn t have a vote _meta_end_dot_

 if dc leaned to the right this wouldn t be an issue _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ i actually have no problem with that bill _meta_end_dot_

 i see nothing wrong with requiring a verifiable paper trail be provided when voting machines are used _meta_end_dot_

 there may be other things hidden in there with which i might object but that particular idea is a good one _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ is moot given the scotus ruling yesterday _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ is schip all over again and an attempt to incrementally expand government health coverage _meta_end_dot_

 if you recall this was the attempt to put families earning up to _meta_number_ref_k a year on the roles as well as children up to the age of _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 with a democratic congress and president the possibility of its passage is greatly increased _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ is simply price controls and _meta_number_ref_ is the liberal desire to dump your tax dollars into fetal stem cell research an area that the market has mostly abandoned for progress on the adult stem cell research side _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ is another scheme to spend money on whatever government decides is worthwhile in terms of renewable energy that s worked out well with ethanol hasn t it _meta_end_question_

 you have to love _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 it is the porkapalooza of all legislation and while bowers doesn t know what it is he s sure that if harkin wants it it must be something progressives want _meta_end_dot_

 well yeah more spending more government more waste _meta_end_dot_

 as for _meta_number_ref_ it may not do much of anything except make official the acceptance of the premise that we have to do something about global warming through government _meta_end_dot_

 and that is its key point _meta_end_dot_

 when the acceptance of the premise is made official through passing this legislation the flood gates of spending taxing and regulation are thrown wide open and will be impossible to ever shut again _meta_end_dot_

 and that s precisely the value of that bill to progressives _meta_end_dot_

 in fact that s the value of the entire agenda _meta_end_dot_

 frog pot warming water _meta_end_dot_

 bowers concludes the most exciting bits are the positive progressive feedback loops around increasing unionization the employee free choice act and election reform d c _meta_end_dot_

 voting rights verified paper trails _meta_end_dot_

 these are laws that will make the country itself more progressive thus building a progressive majority down the road _meta_end_dot_

 if we can get more of these including sweeping media reform about which we should be optimistic real immigration reform about which i am not optimistic and the progressive budget which might just happen by _meta_number_ref_ if all goes well then we will be on our way to a progressive majority in america that will last for an entire generation _meta_end_dot_

 is this what you want to see _meta_end_question_

 fair warning _meta_end_dot_
