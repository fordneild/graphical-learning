  over at msnbc i ran across a piece explaining why men don t pitch in with the housework _meta_end_dot_

 now i thought i knew the answer to that question so it would be interesting to read what the author had to say to see if she agreed _meta_end_dot_

 i would have said _meta_number_ref_ because culturally rightly or wrongly women are expected to do the housework _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ because men generally tend to be more comfortable with a dirty house and the person who s more compulsive about cleaning tends to end up doing more of it _meta_end_dot_

 notice that i m not making any value judgments there or saying that women should always do the housework i m just explaining why i think men end up doing less of it in a relationship _meta_end_dot_

 the author of the piece leslie bennetts seemed to have a different opinion that men didn t do housework because they re like children and aren t married to emasculating devil harpies like well leslie bennetts _meta_end_dot_

 granted the emasculating devil harpy in question didn t phrase it just like that but the only thing i got out of her whole article was an overwhelming sense of pity for her poor long suffering husband who has had to put up with this battle axe _meta_end_dot_

 here are a few excerpts to give you an idea of what i mean when the big holidays roll around the sainted jeremy and i always have a houseful of guests _meta_end_dot_

 i spend days planning shopping and cooking lavish meals for ridiculous numbers of friends and relatives _meta_end_dot_

 i do everything from the flower arranging to the silver polishing to the table setting _meta_end_dot_

 after eating themselves into a stupor one or two people usually rouse themselves long enough to make halfhearted visibly insincere offers to help clean up _meta_end_dot_

 we tell them not to worry about it jeremy does the clean up _meta_end_dot_

 sinking back into torpor they sigh with relief _meta_end_dot_

 oh you re so lucky they murmur _meta_end_dot_

 jeremy is soooo wonderful excuse me _meta_end_question_

 here s a news flash for you jeremy is not soooo wonderful _meta_end_dot_

 i actually am the one who is soooo wonderful _meta_end_dot_

 my own husband claims that any imbalance in our household contributions derives solely from the fact that he has to go to an office while i work at home a luxury that permits me to take care of many domestic tasks during my workday _meta_end_dot_

 this disparity in our schedules may explain why i make dinner every night because i m home to stir the pot on the stove but it does not explain why our weekends begin with him enjoying a third cup of coffee over the morning newspapers while i rush around making breakfast cleaning up the house and organizing the children s day _meta_end_dot_

 i m the one everyone asks when they want to know when the next orthodontist appointment is what the cross country meet schedule is or where the birthday party is being held yes i remembered to buy a present yes it s wrapped and ready to go _meta_end_dot_

 and yet everyone acts as if jeremy deserves some kind of medal just for making a run to the supermarket _meta_end_dot_

 no one has ever suggested that i m a heroine for doing the things every mother is expected to do _meta_end_dot_

 i admit that my husband helps out more than many men but here s another news flash it isn t because he s such a fabulously enlightened being _meta_end_dot_

 left to his own devices he would doubtless park himself in front of the tv like some sitcom male chauvinist couch potato while i did all the work _meta_end_dot_

 the reason jeremy helps as much as he does an offensive terminology that itself suggests who s really being held responsible is simple he doesn t have a choice _meta_end_dot_

 yes dear readers it s true maintaining some semblance of parity in your marriage requires you to deploy the same kinds of nasty tactics you swore you would never stoop to as a parent but nonetheless found yourself using the minute you actually had a kid _meta_end_dot_

 bribery and punishment work so do yelling and complaining _meta_end_dot_

 threats are also effective as long as everyone knows you mean business _meta_end_dot_

 with husbands tender blandishments and nooky are particularly useful as is the withholding of the aforementioned _meta_end_dot_

 the fact that guys when left to their own devices rarely rush to offer more toilet scrubbing and diaper changing is not in itself surprising _meta_end_dot_

 as martin luther king jr _meta_end_dot_

 once observed we know through painful experience that freedom is never voluntarily given by the oppressor it must be demanded by the oppressed so why aren t women demanding something closer to parity _meta_end_question_

 while many are resigned to seething in silence the stakes are far higher than they seem to realize _meta_end_dot_

 when wives permit their husbands to shirk a fair share of the homemaking and parenting not only do they themselves suffer but chances are good that they re also sentencing their children to a similar fate _meta_end_dot_

 when you have kids everything you do teaches them how to live their own lives when they grow up _meta_end_dot_

 unfortunately all too many women are still teaching their children that woman is the n gger of the world as john lennon and yoko ono put it so memorably in a song lyric years ago _meta_end_dot_

 and what too many fathers teach their sons and daughters is that men can get away with dumping the scut work on their wives and that women will grit their teeth and put up with it _meta_end_dot_

 and while i recognize that gender stereotypes are risky in my experience husbands are a lot like children _meta_end_dot_

 they will get away with whatever they can get away with _meta_end_dot_

 when you put your foot down and make it clear that you won t take no for an answer somehow the kids rooms get cleaned the groceries bought the laundry folded _meta_end_dot_

 it really does work i promise _meta_end_dot_

 sam kinison used to do a bit in his act that was undoubtedly inspired by the same sort of cackling feminist witch who wrote this article and it went like this there were times when i just wanted to stop at a red light and get out of the f cking car and run _meta_end_dot_

 you know just leave the engine going and go oh f ck i hate you _meta_end_exclamation_

 i just wanna live trust me after reading this whole article i can tell you that jeremy could totally relate to those lines even if he didn t have the guts to say it in front of his nagging wife _meta_end_dot_

 ps yes jeremy is soooo wonderful because he must have the patience of a saint to put up with such a disrespectful shrew with such a large chip on her shoulder _meta_end_dot_
