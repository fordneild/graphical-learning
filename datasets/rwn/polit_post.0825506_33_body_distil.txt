  for all the feminist empowerment they sure have problems with sex _meta_end_dot_

 and it goes without saying that the metrosexuals unfortunate enough to have to deal with these women are all befuddled too _meta_end_dot_

 sarah palin turns strident feminists into church ladies clucking about her mothering _meta_end_dot_

 and she turns sex starved metrosexual men on _meta_end_dot_

 one of these metrosexual intellectual men a friend of mine actually bought the sarah palin doll _meta_end_dot_

 no i am not making this up _meta_end_dot_

 he s not sure how to vote yet _meta_end_dot_

 but he digs palin _meta_end_dot_

 a lot sarah palin represents a real woman _meta_end_dot_

 she clearly likes men and fraternizes regularly with one hot one her husband _meta_end_dot_

 she embraces the life growing ability of her uterus and has used it for its intended purpose often in her twenty years of marriage _meta_end_dot_

 far from being a freak of nature she s pretty normal for us fly over folks _meta_end_dot_

 sex kids men conservative women tend to like these things _meta_end_dot_

 a lot _meta_end_dot_

 two neighbors within yards of my house have five kids each _meta_end_dot_

 don t mess with these women _meta_end_dot_

 they are tough _meta_end_dot_

 and sexy _meta_end_dot_

 and smart college educated _meta_end_dot_

 and yes christian _meta_end_dot_

 what about this sort of woman upsets feminists so _meta_end_question_

 maxed out mama hilariously ponders this they are believe me they are _meta_end_dot_

 when we flyover women dress you you like to be dressed if you know what i mean _meta_end_dot_

 wink wink _meta_end_dot_

 believe me hon most american men remain slaves to their pocket rockets right through life _meta_end_dot_

 it is our job to make sure that they enjoy their time in service and to lengthen their service life _meta_end_dot_

 pun intended _meta_end_dot_

 so this is our platform if it must be about sex join us in the great sexual debauchery of flyoverland _meta_end_dot_

 we the women of flyover country ask nyc and boston and dc and even perhaps sf to send us your hordes of tired huddled feminist taunted and feminist daunted men _meta_end_dot_

 because we like men and we like sex and that my little puzzled denizens of metrosexualdom is and always has been a winning cultural and political platform _meta_end_dot_

 let s not kid ourselves the only people who won t vote for lots of enjoyable sex are proctologists due to the impaired profits _meta_end_dot_

 sarah palin is sexy _meta_end_dot_

 she has demonstrable evidence that she has sex at least five times _meta_end_dot_

 she s tough _meta_end_dot_

 she s smart _meta_end_dot_

 she s self deprecating _meta_end_dot_

 she works hard _meta_end_dot_

 she doesn t put up with crap therefore she must be a dominatrix according to pointy heads _meta_end_dot_

 about those pointy heads _meta_end_dot_

 shrinkwrapped puts forth a theory as to why feminist women and the men cowed by them have such an issue with governor palin one example comes from the evolution of feminist studies _meta_end_dot_

 it never took a high iq to puzzle out that women had the intellectual capacity to take part as full human beings in the workings of society though it was certainly important and remains important to understand the roots and persistence of bias _meta_end_dot_

 it does not require a high iq to know that a woman should be able to do any work of which she is capable and take part in any way she desires in a society founded on the principle of individual freedom _meta_end_dot_

 it does however require a very high iq to discern the modern feminist shibboleth that there are no fundamental biologically derived differences between men and women and that gender is a social construct imposed upon the populace by the powerful for the interests of the powerful _meta_end_dot_

 that is an argument that requires volumes of erudite often inscrutable prose _meta_end_dot_

 as such only the very brightest can actually wade through it and only the very brightest can actually believe it _meta_end_dot_

 sadly those with lower iqs have only the knowledge gleaned from their own senses and experiences if they believe there are on average real differences between men and women that is simply a testament to their intellectual limitations _meta_end_dot_

 shrink s whole piece makes me laugh out loud because it states the obvious that is not so obvious to the pointy heads our sexual organs and the hormones that drive them force different biological choices _meta_end_dot_

 to further state the obvious a man cannot be impregnated carry a baby birth it and nurse it no matter how badly he wishes to do this _meta_end_dot_

 a woman cannot unless she is a soviet era german compete with a man in the arena of physical power _meta_end_dot_

 it is also fair to say that women think differently than men _meta_end_dot_

 that is not to say they don t think _meta_end_dot_

 this is obvious right _meta_end_question_

 i mean the feminists have made a bloodsport of men bashing exploiting the way men are so stupid _meta_end_dot_

 that would imply that women are smart because they think differently read better _meta_end_dot_

 all this convoluted nonsense which i covered in great detail here makes for strange reactions when a woman who is comfortable with her biology is also comfortable with power _meta_end_dot_

 so feminist women attack sarah palin s _meta_end_dot_

 biology so she doesn t get the power _meta_end_dot_

 newsflash feminists you do realize that this plays to a serious stereotype about women right _meta_end_question_

 far from the sisterhood feminists like to talk about women are known for eating their own pardon the pun _meta_end_dot_

 territorial and catty petty and jealous heaven help the woman who is more beautiful younger smarter and gets the hot guy _meta_end_dot_

 and what have the feminists done _meta_end_question_

 displayed venom about their infringed territory taken to disparaging palins form and style and generally degraded her _meta_end_dot_

 they sound jealous and threatened _meta_end_dot_

 and all women are diminished by their shameful behavior _meta_end_dot_

 camille paglia has been a notable exception _meta_end_dot_

 maybe the feminist women can let go of their identity politics and embrace the broad spectrum pun intended of what it can mean to be a woman _meta_end_dot_

 a fecund uterus is uniquely female _meta_end_dot_

 ladies _meta_end_dot_

 a man simply can t do it _meta_end_dot_

 why is it so threatening when a woman does _meta_end_question_

 for all the female centricity feminists seem exceedingly uncomfortable with sexy fertile powerful women _meta_end_dot_

 those things can go together _meta_end_dot_

 sarah palin proves it _meta_end_dot_

 feminists need to get back in touch with their uteri _meta_end_dot_

 far from being the noose around a woman s neck the uterus is the seat of a woman s literal creative power and it doesn t have to interfere with her other creative powers either _meta_end_dot_

 feminists need to get okay with female sex and power _meta_end_dot_

 it s liberating _meta_end_dot_
