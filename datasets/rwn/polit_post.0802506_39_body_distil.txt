  question how seriously do you take polls _meta_end_question_

 i know you use them quite often to support an opinion but do you really think they re that accurate _meta_end_question_

 i for one have never participated in any survey or polls gallup rasmussen or any others _meta_end_dot_

 i don t personally know anybody else who has either _meta_end_dot_

 most people i know from work or in my family are regular blue collar people who work all day go home and watch the news and spend a little time with their family _meta_end_dot_

 if they go online it s usually for reasons far more recreational than politics _meta_end_dot_

 i m sure there are many people across the country who fit the same mold so how accurate can those polls be _meta_end_question_

 how much credence do you give to the silent majority _meta_end_question_

 the_muck_man answer polls can be very tricky to deal with _meta_end_dot_

 you can consider the quality of the people taking the poll whether it s likely voters registered voters or adults what s being polled the margin of error trends and a few other factors _meta_end_dot_

 but if you can take everything into account polls are very valuable _meta_end_dot_

 put another way if you have a good head for statistics enough data to work with and have enough experience to understand how to interpret the poll data polling is extremely useful _meta_end_dot_

 ps also keep in mind that polls are representative samples _meta_end_dot_

 when you re talking about polling agencies that know what they re doing and they get enough data they don t have to poll everyone to know exactly how things will break down _meta_end_dot_
