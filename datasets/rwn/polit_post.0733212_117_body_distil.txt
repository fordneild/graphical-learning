  there s another big middle eastern peace conference underway that features israel negotiating for peace with a guy abbas who can t deliver it or for that matter offer them anything of value whatsoever _meta_end_dot_

 just to emphasize how insane the whole process is from israel s point of view hamas which controls half of the disputed territories isn t participating and palestinian terrorist groups have announced that they re going to fire missiles at israel during the peace conference _meta_end_dot_

 the sad reality is that no matter what agreements are signed peace isn t around the corner because the palestinians aren t offering it and there isn t a single soul or a group amongst them capable of delivering it even if they were _meta_end_dot_

 ps the really scary thing here isn t that a deal might not be reached it s that bush and olmert are both unpopular and might be willing to see israel make some sort of horrible deal if they believe it will improve their political fortunes _meta_end_dot_
