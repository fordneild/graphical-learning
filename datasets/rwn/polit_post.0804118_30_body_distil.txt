  it really can t get any better _meta_end_dot_

 for sh ts and giggles chimpymustgo skinner please institute the thread limit asap _meta_end_dot_

 please we re begging you _meta_end_exclamation_

 remember when we had to post _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ paragraphs of actual thought in order to start a thread _meta_end_question_

 that was back in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 but things have gotten much worse than even those dark times _meta_end_dot_

 the thread limit will go a long way toward redeeming this forum _meta_end_dot_

 thanking you in advance _meta_end_dot_

 what was that middle part _meta_end_question_

 fyi for people not familiar with the du skinner is one of the founders and co owners of the du _meta_end_dot_
