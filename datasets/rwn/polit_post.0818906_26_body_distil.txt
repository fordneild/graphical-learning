  john kerry says republican john mccain doesn t have the judgment to be president _meta_end_dot_

 if that s the case then it s probably a good thing mccain rejected overtures from kerry the democratic presidential nominee in _meta_number_ref_ to form a bipartisan ticket and run with kerry as his candidate for vice president _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 mccain came to kerry s aid in march _meta_number_ref_ after bush and his campaign tried to paint the democrat as weak on defense _meta_end_dot_

 he rejected the suggestion in broadcast interviews and chided both parties for waging such a bitter and partisan campaign _meta_end_dot_

 for the record kerry is not among those being mentioned as possible running mates for mccain hope yen associated press
