  i m a pretty fair and open minded person _meta_end_dot_

 it is a blessing and a curse _meta_end_dot_

 it is a blessing because it allows me to understand empathize and deeply consider where different points of view are coming from even if they are completely opposite of my own _meta_end_dot_

 of course it is a curse because in many cases it leaves me confused as to which way is the right way to go _meta_end_dot_

 my fallback for this is to follow my basic instincts however my gut isn t always right _meta_end_dot_

 i don t have much in the gift of insight _meta_end_dot_

 ed morrissey asked the question do blogs matter in presidential politics _meta_end_question_

 he concludes with the answer that while they have success in influencing policy they have a long ways to go in gaining significant influence of presidential elections _meta_end_dot_

 for the most part is completely correct _meta_end_dot_

 basically it comes down to sheer numbers _meta_end_dot_

 even the most widely read conservative blogs average around _meta_number_ref_ to _meta_number_ref_ thousand readers on a daily basis _meta_end_dot_

 factor in the fact that most of these readers already think in a similar vein as the blogs they choose to read and that some of that number is repeat visits and the numbers we have any influence over are not that significant compared to the general public _meta_end_dot_

 we ve had our influential victories like stopping the harriet myers fiasco but what it really boils down to for blogs is who is reading not how many most of our victories in influencing change have been through cooperating together in teamwork towards one goal _meta_end_dot_

 basically what the point i m leading up to is that the overall conservative blogosphere has discovered just how small its influence is at this point in matters such presidential elections _meta_end_dot_

 it is one thing to influence policy and fire up the base _meta_end_dot_

 it is another to reach to millions of people who unfortunately still get most of their information from the msm _meta_end_dot_

 there is no doubt that this election is a victory for the msm in stamping down just how much influence they still retain _meta_end_dot_

 most conservatives are looking at the choices we have left and seeing this whole whole election completely upside down _meta_end_dot_

 this entire election process has been unpredictable in my opinion and has slapped conventional wisdom in the face many times _meta_end_dot_

 at the beggining of this election cycle john mccain s campaign faded to the point that many wrote him off and wondered what was taking him so long to drop out _meta_end_dot_

 the clear frontrunner was rudy giulliani and perhaps the rantings of the blogosphere on his liberal stances was a success _meta_end_dot_

 however most likely his downfall was a combination of poor strategy in staking it all on florida and the scandal about him using new york tax payer money to taxi around his mistress _meta_end_dot_

 regardless the conventional wisdom and in this case the media were dead wrong _meta_end_dot_

 when fred thompson finally entered the picture he was haunted by the media meme of entering too late and being lazy _meta_end_dot_

 the conservative base and blogosphere begged for him and when he finally came it was an uphill battle _meta_end_dot_

 however the majority of the conservative blogosphere rallied behind him _meta_end_dot_

 alas it wasn t enough _meta_end_dot_

 the question of how much influence talk radio has is being asked as well _meta_end_dot_

 look people think for themselves _meta_end_dot_

 thats a good thing isn t it _meta_end_question_

 since i m getting long winded in making my point i ll sum it up _meta_end_dot_

 from tancredo to hunter to thompson one by one the most conservative candidates dropped out for lack of support _meta_end_dot_

 its being proven over and over from ron paul to fred thompson that intense support online does not equal support in the general public _meta_end_dot_

 the conservatives rallied to what many thought was the last chance for a candidate with any relation to a conservative and got behind romney _meta_end_dot_

 its now looking like that wasn t enough either _meta_end_dot_

 while many think that huckabee should have dropped out before super tuesday he was the shocker last night coming in with a sweep of the south _meta_end_dot_

 it really isn t that shocking when you think about though _meta_end_dot_

 of course a southern baptist preacher that is pro gun pro life pro family and pro god will be attractive to the south _meta_end_dot_

 it seems they were willing to forgive his history on raising taxes in favor of him abolishing the irs _meta_end_dot_

 it really doesn t matter because huckabee still doesn t have a chance of catching mccain probably the most hated candidate in the conservative blogosphere _meta_end_dot_

 its not over yet but many are surrendering that our nominee will be mccain _meta_end_dot_

 the msm has basically crowned him already _meta_end_dot_

 so with the many many flaws mccain has with conservatives where does that leave the principled conservative _meta_end_question_

 here is where i finally get to my point _meta_end_dot_

 there are many directions conservatives will take _meta_end_dot_

 here are a few _meta_end_dot_

 i can actually see where all of these view points are coming from _meta_end_dot_

 getting behind mccain basically this argument goes a little beyond the lines of party loyalty _meta_end_dot_

 the question is how that will be interpreted _meta_end_dot_

 you have to whittle down what the republican nominee has in common with the democrat vs _meta_end_dot_

 how they differ from the democrats _meta_end_dot_

 while mccain is pro amnesty anti free speech and has his many other liberal tendancies he is pro victory pro life and he isn t planning to bring socialized medicine to america _meta_end_dot_

 actually voting democrat ann coulter and tammy bruce have both said they would consider voting for hillary if mccain ends up the nominee _meta_end_dot_

 basically the argument is that if the country is to go to hell in a handbasket let it happen under the democrat banner and not the republican one _meta_end_dot_

 the one thing that worries me about this is nominating judges _meta_end_dot_

 i would go out on a limb and say that its a better gamble to trust mccain over hillary or obama on putting up a conservative judge _meta_end_dot_

 then again we are talking about the leader of the gang of _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 we do have his word but what good is that _meta_end_question_

 the counter argument to this is that it won t teach the establishment anything and it hasn t in the past _meta_end_dot_

 of course it isn t as much the establishment that needs convincing as the general population _meta_end_dot_

 personally my principles wouldn t allow me to touch the screen for a socialist democrat _meta_end_dot_

 sitting it out its basically an argument of principle over party _meta_end_dot_

 the position of james dobson i cannot and i will not vote for sen _meta_end_dot_

 john mccain as a matter of conscience i simply will not cast a ballot for president for the first time in my life _meta_end_dot_

 steven brainbridge if the choice is between choosing the lesser of _meta_number_ref_ evils and teeing up a process by which the gop reinvents itself for the _meta_number_ref_st century i m inclined to opt for the latter _meta_end_dot_

 coupled with losing congress in _meta_number_ref_ losing the presidency in _meta_number_ref_ will provide a pair of defeats that surely will prompt attentiveness on the part of the gop leadership and the intellectual base of think tanks and academics who helped lay the foundation for the reagan and gingrich revolutions _meta_end_dot_

 anti idiotarian rottweiller my principles are mine they ve remained unchanged through hell and high water and i m not about to abandon them for they are what i am _meta_end_dot_

 without them i am nothing _meta_end_dot_

 they are not for sale to the highest bidder much less are they to be discarded in the face of adversity _meta_end_dot_

 they are mine and nobody can take them away from me _meta_end_dot_

 i can only lose them by throwing them away myself and were i to do so i would be worth less than the basest cur on the planet _meta_end_dot_

 so endorse your mccain rinos carry him on your shoulders to a landslide defeat that will be remembered for all time but do it without me _meta_end_dot_

 dan riehl the grass roots doesn t take its marching orders from right side pundits _meta_end_dot_

 independent registrations are growing both parties numbers have been struggling _meta_end_dot_

 many that would normally support the gop simply won t show up _meta_end_dot_

 i ve been hearing that from plenty of people who are not bloggers and such _meta_end_dot_

 they re fed up and this would be the final straw _meta_end_dot_

 bill quick is so fed up he is even trying to start the american conservative party _meta_end_dot_

 this is probably what i will do _meta_end_dot_

 i want to vote for someone instead of against someone for a change _meta_end_dot_

 if no one can motivate me to get off the couch and vote for something i probably won t _meta_end_dot_

 my advice to other is to follow your instincts _meta_end_dot_

 don t follow the crowd whether that be the conservative pundits or the republican establishment _meta_end_dot_

 if you think we can survive four years with a socialist like hillary or obama and that it will leave conservatives in a better position at a later date go for it _meta_end_dot_

 if you truly believe in your heart that this will benefit the country in the long run by teaching a hard lesson follow your instinct _meta_end_dot_

 if answering your concience and standing by your principles are more important to you than party identification _meta_end_dot_

 if you weigh it out and think the dangers of a democrat in power is less important than sticking with your moral beliefs and holding those that promise to implement those values to their word then sit it out _meta_end_dot_

 if you think that holding your nose and voting for the lesser of two evils is your the only sane option for the sake of the country then do it _meta_end_dot_

 if surrender in iraq and socialized medicine don t scare you as much as compromising values and moving a cause more towards the left then do what your heart tells you _meta_end_dot_

 don t follow the crowd do what you think is right _meta_end_dot_
