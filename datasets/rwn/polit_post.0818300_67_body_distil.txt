  chrysler reports that it s shutting down minivan production _meta_end_dot_

 foreman said these jobs are goin boys and they ain t comin back _meta_end_dot_

 to your hometown bruce was right then and he d be right to say it now too but not for the reasons he thinks _meta_end_dot_

 it s not because of free trade or even because folks in other countries are willing to be exploited _meta_end_dot_

 it s not because of gasoline prices or awful automotive design and engineering _meta_end_dot_

 it s not because of a general economic decline _meta_end_dot_

 those jobs are going boys because the structure of american automobile labor arrangements is hopeless even for the private equity boys who bought chrysler _meta_end_dot_

 or maybe precisely for the private equity boys who watch dollars and understand what they do better than millions of public shareholders _meta_end_dot_

 they re watching dollars go into hopelessly out of date union seniority rules health plans pensions the kind of benefits that few credentialed professionals can hope for much less semi skilled auto plant labor _meta_end_dot_

 and them dollars boys they ain t coming back _meta_end_dot_

 gas prices will fall and a lot in the next year _meta_end_dot_

 american cars will continue to get better and better _meta_end_dot_

 american factories will continue to put out very good products in the industries in which they re competitive _meta_end_dot_

 but unless and until the united auto workers fundamentally changes itself into something that is culturally historically and politically it never has been is not and probably never can be they ain t comin back _meta_end_dot_

 ron coleman s pretty good blog is likelihood of success _meta_end_dot_
