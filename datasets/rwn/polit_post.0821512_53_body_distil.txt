  w ell of course they have _meta_end_dot_

 and look who is shifting with them my interest is in making sure we ve got the kind of comprehensive energy policy that can bring down gas prices obama said in an interview with the palm beach post _meta_end_dot_

 if in order to get that passed we have to compromise in terms of a careful well thought out drilling strategy that was carefully circumscribed to avoid significant environmental damage i don t want to be so rigid that we can t get something done obama said _meta_end_dot_

 in other words his opposition isn t rooted in principle it s just a representation of party dogma _meta_end_dot_

 and if adhering to the dogma is going to cost him votes why then he s not to rigid about his supposed beliefs _meta_end_dot_

 new politics eh _meta_end_question_

 and on a related subject see if you can follow the logic here suddenly obama is for an energy policy to include drilling that can bring gas prices dow n but right after that he talks about a second stimulus package of _meta_number_ref_ billion dollars half in _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ checks and half in infrastructure repairs taken from windfall taxes on oil companies _meta_end_dot_

 can anyone see the inherent problem in that plan _meta_end_question_

 once more for the record corporations don t pay taxes people do _meta_end_dot_

 so who will pay those windfall taxes and where is the most likely place that will happen _meta_end_question_

 yes at the pump _meta_end_dot_

 and how will they do that _meta_end_question_

 by raising prices there _meta_end_dot_

 brilliant _meta_end_dot_
