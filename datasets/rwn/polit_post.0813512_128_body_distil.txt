  like many tired old pop stars with nothing better to do paul mccartney has ostentatiously embraced the phony environmentalism craze _meta_end_dot_

 like the rest of them his carbon footprint remains many times larger than those of us peasants especially after his new _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ hybrid lexus limousine was delivered by jet creating _meta_number_ref_ times more of the carbon emissions moonbats fret about than if it had been shipped _meta_end_dot_

 the point of the car is that it will supposedly reduce these same harmless emissions _meta_end_dot_

 how emblematic of the entire pointless fad van helsing at moonbattery
