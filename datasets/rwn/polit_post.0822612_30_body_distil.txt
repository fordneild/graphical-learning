  liberals being liberals make certain assumptions when it comes to foreign affairs _meta_end_dot_

 among them are _meta_number_ref_ whatever happens in the world if it s bad must somehow be the fault of the bush administration and or america _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ any country that is allied with america by virtue of being allied with america must be in the wrong if it gets into a conflict with a nation that is not allied with america _meta_end_dot_

 that brings us to russia s war of aggression on georgia _meta_end_dot_

 russia has spent years engineering this conflict cared nothing about the civilians it killed and aimed to thwart democracy intimidate other free states in the region and to destroy an alternate route for oil outside of its borders _meta_end_dot_

 there were no good intentions no higher purposes just the russians attacking a smaller weaker neighbor because it was to their advantage and no one was in a position to stop them _meta_end_dot_

 so is the anti war left railing against russia _meta_end_question_

 no _meta_end_dot_

 to the contrary their reactions tend to be either muted or they re bending over backwards to try to find ways to blame george bush and the georgians for russia s murderous attacks _meta_end_dot_

 don t buy it _meta_end_question_

 well here are just a few reactions from the netroots to russia s rampage is it possible that this time the october surprise was tried in august and that the garbage issue of brave little georgia struggling for its survival from the grasp of the russian bear was stoked to influence the u s _meta_end_dot_

 presidential election robert scheer at the huffington post since cheney has exactly the same view about the use of american military power as putin does about russian power i m not sure what grounds he has to complain _meta_end_dot_

 maybe we should start complaining when as many georgians have perished as iraqis and when putin throws thousands of innocent georgians into torture chambers andrew sullivan if bill clinton were still president and the republicans still controlled congress i think they d skip the impeachment hearings and proceed directly to a bill of attainder _meta_end_dot_

 as kevin drum says this explains why the beloved leader stayed in beijing and the secretary of state stayed on vacation as the russian tanks rolled into south ossetia that wasn t actually a surprise _meta_end_dot_

 the only surprise was that the tanks didn t stop at the provincial border _meta_end_dot_

 clearly if we were going to tell the russians they were free to clobber the georgians we should have told the georgians the same thing _meta_end_dot_

 please be restrained isn t at all the same thing as you re on your own buddy if saakashvili had known that the russians had the green light from us he wouldn t have tried to take tskhinvali mark kleiman at the daily kos nato the us and europe broke their word _meta_end_dot_

 they expanded nato further and further into what russia considers its buffer states states which cannot be allowed to fall into the hands of potential enemies _meta_end_dot_

 russian geopolitics has been obsessed with controlling those states for centuries along with getting a warm water port _meta_end_dot_

 this is not a short term minor issue _meta_end_dot_

 it is at the heart of what russia believes it needs to be defensible lots and lots of space _meta_end_dot_

 next us and western policy towards russia in the _meta_number_ref_ s was based around a shock therapy transition to a free market _meta_end_dot_

 the result of that was an actual decline in the russian population _meta_end_dot_

 us neo liberal economics applied to russia killed millions of people _meta_end_dot_

 no exaggeration _meta_end_dot_

 it wasn t the only cause but when you ve promised the sky and the free marketers did and the result is hell on earth well people remember that ian welsh firedoglake washington s bloody fingerprints are all over the invasion of south ossetia _meta_end_dot_

 georgia president mikhail saakashvili would never dream of launching a massive military attack unless he got explicit orders from his bosses at _meta_number_ref_ pennsylvania ave _meta_end_dot_

 after all saakashvili owes his entire political career to american power brokers and us intelligence agencies _meta_end_dot_

 if he disobeyed them he d be gone in a fortnight _meta_end_dot_

 besides an operation like this takes months of planning and logistical support especially if it s perfectly timed to coincide with the beginning of the olympic games _meta_end_dot_

 another petty neocon touch that means pentagon planners must have been working hand in hand with georgian generals for months in advance _meta_end_dot_

 nothing was left to chance putin has played his cards very wisely which makes it look like the fighting in south ossetia may be washington s way of trying to win through military force what they could not achieve via the free market mike whitney the smirking chimp give it a few weeks and the comments you ve just read will be the conventional wisdom on the left _meta_end_dot_
