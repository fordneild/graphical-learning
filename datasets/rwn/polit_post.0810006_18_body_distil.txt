  i don t have a lot of respect for paul krugman and think he gets almost everything wrong but this excerpt from his latest column proves that even a blind squirrel stumbles across a nut every once in a while the subsidized conversion of crops into fuel was supposed to promote energy independence and help limit global warming _meta_end_dot_

 but this promise was as time magazine bluntly put it a scam this is especially true of corn ethanol even on optimistic estimates producing a gallon of ethanol from corn uses most of the energy the gallon contains _meta_end_dot_

 but it turns out that even seemingly good biofuel policies like brazil s use of ethanol from sugar cane accelerate the pace of climate change by promoting deforestation _meta_end_dot_

 and meanwhile land used to grow biofuel feedstock is land not available to grow food so subsidies to biofuels are a major factor in the food crisis _meta_end_dot_

 you might put it this way people are starving in africa so that american politicians can court votes in farm states there are biofuels that show some promise but ethanol is not among them _meta_end_dot_

 yet we have politicians both democrats and republicans relentlessly pushing this useless biofuel along with equally unproductive forms of clean energy like wind farms and solar power _meta_end_question_

 why _meta_end_question_

 because it s the perfect political scam _meta_end_dot_

 these politicians get to funnel tax dollars to their supporters who pay them back with donations and as an added bonus they get to claim that they re big supporters of the environment because they support biofuels solar and wind power _meta_end_dot_

 meanwhile it s the much demonized oil coal and natural gas companies that power our economy and will continue to do so for the foreseeable future barring some sort of unforeseen technological breakthrough _meta_end_dot_
