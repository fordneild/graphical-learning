  last week i posted some quotations from dexter yager who is a big wheeler dealer in the business world and in amway aka quixtar _meta_end_dot_

 that prompted a couple of emails asking if i was in the business or not _meta_end_dot_

 actually back in college i used to be and for good or ill it was one hell of an experience that i ve always meant to write about _meta_end_dot_

 now seems like as good a time as ever _meta_end_dot_

 it all started when i had a buddy from college contact me and ask me to go to a business meeting _meta_end_dot_

 i hadn t heard of amway but i ve never liked taking orders from anyone didn t mind working hard and figured that if it would help me get into business for myself i d give it a look _meta_end_dot_

 so i headed to charlotte i was home for the summer but i went to college there caught a meeting was impressed by what was said liked the people i met and despite some warnings that amway was a scam i decided to give it a try anyway _meta_end_dot_

 that decision was the beginning of two years of hard labor _meta_end_dot_

 and amway is hard work especially if you re like a college kid with not particularly impressive people skills _meta_end_dot_

 the whole thing seems simple you sponsor people into the business they sell or buy products and you get a cut of the action as does every person above you in your line _meta_end_dot_

 so the more people you sponsor and the more people those people sponsor the more products you move the more money you make _meta_end_dot_

 some people will tell you that nobody is making money at amway except a few guys at the top of the food chain not true _meta_end_dot_

 but at least in my neck of the woods the people making the biggest chunks of change were a private business owner and a dentist in other words exactly the sort of people who didn t need a business like amway to make money which makes sense if you think about it _meta_end_dot_

 if you were going to get into a business who would be better able to convince you it s a good idea _meta_end_question_

 a poor college kid like i was or a guy whom you already know is a success _meta_end_question_

 the system is geared to try to get around that problem by getting people to meetings where they can meet other successful people but you still have to get them that far and i wasn t so good at it _meta_end_dot_

 that s not to say that i didn t sign anybody up _meta_end_dot_

 i did manage to bring in a few and one of the people in my line a guy by the name of lamar who was a walk on for the school basketball team had a lot of charisma _meta_end_dot_

 mainly through his efforts my line was up to almost _meta_number_ref_ people at one time _meta_end_dot_

 the problem was that all of them were college kids and none of us had the money to buy a lot of products or the skills necessary to sell them _meta_end_dot_

 so that _meta_number_ref_ people didn t produce a lot of dough _meta_end_dot_

 but the business did take money out of our pockets and time out of our schedules _meta_end_dot_

 for those of us who were dedicated enough and i was you went to a meeting on monday where you brought new prospects and a meeting afterwards for the people who were in the business _meta_end_dot_

 during the week you were supposed to try to meet new people get their phone numbers and then call them on sundays at another meeting to try to convince them to come to the monday meeting _meta_end_dot_

 then there were the functions _meta_end_dot_

 there were usually smaller functions that were relatively close about once a month and bigger ones that were father away every few months _meta_end_dot_

 the idea behind these functions was to give you the knowledge you needed to be better at amway and more importantly to motivate you _meta_end_dot_

 why was the motivation angle so important _meta_end_question_

 because doing amway like a job where you have to do cold calls or sales can be incredibly deflating _meta_end_dot_

 you hear a lot of people saying no to you _meta_end_dot_

 you have people promise that they ll show up and they flake _meta_end_dot_

 you can sometimes especially if you re not very good at it go weeks or even months without having any success _meta_end_dot_

 so you need to keep growing personally you need to keep getting pumped up you need to keep on keeping on if you are ever going to make it work and many people didn t but for a long long time i did _meta_end_dot_

 in fact i was dogged enough to do things that most people simply would not do _meta_end_dot_

 once there was a function in raleigh that i had to start driving back from utterly exhausted at about midnight _meta_end_dot_

 i was so tired i had to keep doing things to try to stay awake and eventually i am not sure if i tried i failed or what but just as i was driving into the parking lot of the place where i lived i realized that i could not remember a thing that had happened for the last two hours _meta_end_dot_

 everyone has heard of sleep walking but i did a little sleep driving and it was really scary to realize that _meta_end_dot_

 the bigger functions that were farther away were even more problematic because i seldom had the money to fully pay my own way _meta_end_dot_

 multiple times i went to these functions and slept in my car for the whole week end because i couldn t even afford to share a hotel room _meta_end_dot_

 i can still remember at one of them and this was another one where i slept in my car having nothing to eat for a week end except a bag of apples and a bag of powdered doughnuts which was all i could afford and have gas to get back home and that s not the worst of it _meta_end_dot_

 once i wasn t able to drive for a function that was on a college campus and i didn t have the money to afford to share a hotel room for all _meta_number_ref_ nights _meta_end_dot_

 friends of mine offered to let me stay with them for free but i had too much pride for that and so i decided to just go find a place to sleep _meta_end_dot_

 eventually i settled on an elevator and spent the night asleep on the floor _meta_end_dot_

 i was awakened by a security guard who was apparently doing his early morning rounds around _meta_number_ref_ am _meta_end_dot_

 i talked fast kept walking and didn t chance getting arrested _meta_end_dot_

 so with all this work all this sacrifice how much was i making _meta_end_question_

 pretty much nothing _meta_end_dot_

 i am not sure i ever made a hundred bucks in the business _meta_end_dot_

 why _meta_end_question_

 well remember those _meta_number_ref_ people in my line _meta_end_question_

 they were college kids and moved very little product _meta_end_dot_

 furthermore with college kids being college kids most of them soon got tired of taking it in the chin in amway and quit while i couldn t seem to replace them _meta_end_dot_

 i just did not have the people skills at that time to meet someone at say a gas station talk to them for _meta_number_ref_ minutes get their phone number call them back later that week talk them into coming to a business meeting get them signed up at the meeting and then lead them into success in a brutal business _meta_end_dot_

 in fact with all due respect to amway the business is sort of like selling dog turds as door stops _meta_end_dot_

 most people couldn t ever make it work and the few people who could could probably be making a hell of a lot more money doing something else _meta_end_dot_

 now the flip side to that one that amway people would surely point out is that there are plenty of people some of them who didn t have impressive business backgrounds who have made the business work _meta_end_dot_

 that s very true and it s partially because of the very important fringe benefits of amway _meta_end_dot_

 you get turned on to really good books _meta_end_dot_

 you get to hear really good motivational speakers who understand how to communicate with people _meta_end_dot_

 you get to associate with really ambitious christian people who are striving to make their lives better _meta_end_dot_

 you become used to sacrificing to try to get to where you want to be in life _meta_end_dot_

 those are not small things and they are why i don t consider my time in amway to be wasted despite the fact that i lost money on the whole enterprise _meta_end_dot_

 i was always a voracious reader especially of books on psychology and communications but amway introduced me to a lot of excellent new material _meta_end_dot_

 it also got me around a lot of successful people and getting to pick their brains taught me a lot _meta_end_dot_

 additionally it taught me a little something about putting in effort most people just aren t willing to do what it takes to succeed _meta_end_dot_

 but after the crap i did to try to make it in amway working late into the night every week day after work on my blog getting _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ hours sleep and then doing it all again day after day week after week and year after year didn t seem so bad _meta_end_dot_

 still eventually i wore down and little things started to bother me _meta_end_dot_

 for example although i am a christian i thought the particular group i was in put a little too much emphasis on christianity _meta_end_dot_

 i heard higher ups say things like the purpose of this business isn t to make money it s to bring more people to christ and you can t succeed in this business if you re not a christian actually a lot of people were believe it or not introduced to the good lord through amway but it bugged me a little to hear people going so far overboard because we were supposed to be a business not a church _meta_end_dot_

 also it seems like a minor thing now but i got a chance to meet one of the big rock stahs of the business at a function _meta_end_dot_

 this is a guy a lot of amway people have heard of a guy whose tapes i had loved a guy whom people talked about like he was the greatest man on earth _meta_end_dot_

 well a guy upline from me knew him introduced me i was genuinely excited to meet him and he didn t say a word to me and barely paid attention to me as he shook my hand beyond looking at me like something he just scraped off his shoe _meta_end_dot_

 maybe he was having a bad day i don t know but i couldn t help but think geeze this is the sort of guy we ve been taking advice from _meta_end_question_

 he s a real jerk but of course the real problem was that i was having trouble making new contacts to pitch and i was frustrated that i seemed to be going nowhere in the business _meta_end_dot_

 so i made a decision and called it a career after roughly two years in the game _meta_end_dot_

 i walked out of amway with less money than i took in but i also left as a better person than when i started _meta_end_dot_

 when it was over i had a burning desire to do something besides work for some company _meta_end_dot_

 that s not just because i had an anti authoritarian streak and hate to take orders but because i don t like working for people who look at me as nothing more than a human widget that they will use or dispose of based on little more than whether i m a plus or minus on their balance sheets _meta_end_dot_

 would i recommend amway to other people _meta_end_question_

 probably not _meta_end_dot_

 so would i tell people who are in the business to quit _meta_end_question_

 no i wouldn t do that either _meta_end_dot_

 there are some people who make it and i can tell you if i hadn t had the experiences that i did in amway i m not sure i would have had the grit to blog for a living _meta_end_dot_

 ten years ago maybe even five years ago i d have told you that amway was a waste a time and i might have even been right _meta_end_dot_

 but i still have this haunting feeling that those experiences helped mold me into a better person than i would have been otherwise _meta_end_dot_
