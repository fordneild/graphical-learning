  question is an amnesty easier to defeat under president mccain or president obama _meta_end_question_

 i hate the thought of either of those two as president thresher answer that s a tricky question to answer because _meta_number_ref_ amnesty would be more difficult to defeat under mccain because republicans would feel a lot more pressure to go along with him _meta_end_dot_

 but and this is a big but _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ mccain is promising security first and not to move forward on a path to citizenship until the border is secure while obama debatably at least seemed to be agreeing with hillary clinton in the houston debate that he would move forward with comprehensive immigration reform in his first _meta_number_ref_ days _meta_end_dot_

 i don t have any illusions about mccain on illegal immigration _meta_end_dot_

 he s an open borders and amnesty pol just like obama _meta_end_dot_

 that being said i think mccain is much less likely to pull the trigger on an amnesty because he has said over and over again on the campaign trail that the american people are demanding border security first and that he intends to listen to them _meta_end_dot_

 put another way mccain has gotten himself into a read my lips no new taxes position on illegal immigration _meta_end_dot_

 if he backs any sort of amnesty before the border is secure which let s be perfectly honest here isn t going to happen by _meta_number_ref_ it will destroy his effectiveness as president _meta_end_dot_

 that s why i would rather have mccain in there on the immigration issue despite his horrible record because i think it s much more likely that with him in charge we ll punt on amnesty until at least _meta_number_ref_ and by then hopefully attrition by enforcement will have gotten rid of a few million illegals and we ll have a conservative running for office while mccain at age _meta_number_ref_ will decide not to run for a _meta_number_ref_nd term _meta_end_dot_
