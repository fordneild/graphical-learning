  back in the day i used to love to play dungeons and dragons _meta_end_dot_

 then over time i got more into video games although they can t hold my attention like they used to and the whole idea of massively multiplayer online role playing game mmorpg fascinated me _meta_end_dot_

 however there were two things that kept me from ever getting into mmorpg _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ so much of it is time intensive _meta_end_dot_

 put another way the deciding factor in how well you do is how much time you re willing to spend playing _meta_end_dot_

 when you re a college student or have nothing better to do after work than just play video games for _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ hours at a stretch that may sound pretty appealing but if you re a busy person who has the time to play that much _meta_end_question_

 _meta_number_ref_ these games reminded me too much of this _meta_end_dot_

 warcraft sequel lets gamers play a character playing warcraft now i used to work for an isp and unsurprisingly there were a lot of hard core gaming junkies working there _meta_end_dot_

 once and i kid you not i had one of them tell me that he was spending hours in a game working on his fishing skill _meta_end_dot_

 in other words he sat in front of a computer logged into a game where his character was fishing _meta_end_dot_

 another person told me they were running a shop online in one of these mmorpgs _meta_end_dot_

 i was flabbergasted _meta_end_dot_

 what s the point of playing a game where you spend hours fishing something that you could actually do in real life or worse yet working at a business isn t that the sort of mundane thing you play games to get away from _meta_end_question_

 hat tip hot air for the video _meta_end_dot_
