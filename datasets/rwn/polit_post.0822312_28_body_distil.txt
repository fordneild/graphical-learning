  it s about bleeping time a writer with one of the leading comedy shows in the us who preferred not to be named because of continuing sensitivities about how far comedians should go from some network executives said we had a hard time convincing people that obama is funny for a long time _meta_end_dot_

 our audiences seemed unsure whether to laugh at him _meta_end_dot_

 the first black president is not a gag _meta_end_dot_

 but that s changing because he s doing more stuff that s easy to mock and people are more familiar with him some of the jokes craig ferguson barack obama was in germany today and he did this speech and _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ people showed up _meta_end_dot_

 there were so many germans shouting and screaming that france surrendered just in case jimmy kimmel they really love barack obama in germany _meta_end_dot_

 he s like a rock star over there _meta_end_dot_

 impressive until you realize that david hasselhoff is also like a rock star over there david letterman signs barack obama is overconfident _meta_end_dot_

 proposed bill to change oklahoma to oklabama offered bush _meta_number_ref_ bucks for the mission accomplished banner _meta_end_dot_

 asked guy at staples which chair will work best in an oval shaped office having head measured for mount rushmore _meta_end_dot_

 offered mccain a job in gift shop at obama presidential library _meta_end_dot_

 jay leno of course obama s supporters got him his usual birthday gifts of gold frankincense and myrrh jay leno obama s people are trying to portray mccain as cranky and mccain is trying to portray obama as arrogant you see _meta_end_dot_

 and when obama was asked what he thought about being called arrogant well he said he was above having to answer that question jay leno see barack obama on the news _meta_end_question_

 he s becoming a workout fanatic _meta_end_dot_

 well he has to stay in shape to do those flip flops jay leno barack obama back from his big european tour _meta_end_dot_

 did you see him in europe _meta_end_question_

 people were cheering him holding up signs blowing him kisses _meta_end_dot_

 and that was just the american media covering the story up until recently jon stewart was a rarity amongst late night comedians talk show hosts who would dare to make light of the chosen one in spite of the fact that there was and is much humor to be shared over the democrat nominee for president _meta_end_dot_

 others it seems were afraid of offending their majority pro obama audiences didn t want to be viewed as racists and of course there s the strong possibility that some of those same talk show hosts supported bo _meta_end_dot_

 all this in spite of the fact that there has been tons of material out there to use against obama as i noted in this post _meta_end_dot_

 oh well _meta_end_dot_

 better late than never _meta_end_dot_
