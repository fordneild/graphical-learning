  testosterone does good things for a body both male and female _meta_end_dot_

 it increases bone density muscle mass mental acuity increases metabolism enhances libido and according to this research fights against metabolic syndrome in older men _meta_end_dot_

 so researchers are encouraging older men to supplement with testosterone _meta_end_dot_

 futurepundit via instapundit worries about the evolutionary implications of declining testosterone in older men and that it might be a protective adaptation against diseases like cancer since hormones especially testosterone and estrogen can be tumor growth factors _meta_end_dot_

 maybe _meta_end_dot_

 testosterone for men is the defining healthy hormone just as progesterone is the defining healthy hormone for women _meta_end_dot_

 for both men and women the ratio of testosterone estrogen and the ratio of progesterone estrogen changes as they age _meta_end_dot_

 in both cases estrogen increases proportionally _meta_end_dot_

 part of it is age _meta_end_dot_

 part of it is diet _meta_end_dot_

 part of it is environmental _meta_end_dot_

 estrogens are everywhere in the environment from plastics to soy _meta_end_dot_

 fat stores and releases estrogen _meta_end_dot_

 estrogen in and of itself isn t bad but it can be problematic when it s in the wrong proportion to testosterone and progesterone _meta_end_dot_

 so men can supplement with testosterone and women can supplement with progesterone and testosterone too for that matter and this will happen the body will down regulate _meta_end_dot_

 that is the body will stop producing as much testosterone and progesterone in response to the supplementation _meta_end_dot_

 this happens with all hormones which is why once a person is on synthroid synthetic thyroid hormone he or she is on it for life _meta_end_dot_

 the body will stop producing it _meta_end_dot_

 now there are vegetable based hormone replacements that are less manipulative of the system and they can give the body a rest to recover but the ideal is to produce these hormones oneself without the aid of supplementation _meta_end_dot_

 the answer to hormone balance is simple but no one wants to do it because it s certainly not as easy as a supplement lose the fat _meta_end_dot_

 fat produces the estrogens _meta_end_dot_

 lose the fat the hormone ratio gets better _meta_end_dot_

 build muscle _meta_end_dot_

 especially lower body muscle _meta_end_dot_

 muscle growth produces testosterone _meta_end_dot_

 eat right _meta_end_dot_

 you know what that means _meta_end_dot_

 everyone knows what that means _meta_end_dot_

 lean protein _meta_end_dot_

 eggs _meta_end_dot_

 veggies _meta_end_dot_

 good fats like butter and olive oil and flax _meta_end_dot_

 skip fast food _meta_end_dot_

 skip soda _meta_end_dot_

 skip fried food _meta_end_dot_

 drink alcohol moderately _meta_end_dot_

 drink coffee moderately _meta_end_dot_

 eat chocolate moderately _meta_end_dot_

 keep moving _meta_end_dot_

 it s not just the muscle it s the metabolic rate _meta_end_dot_

 aerobic exercise burns off the stress hormones that cause you to accumulate fat in the first place which stores estrogen _meta_end_dot_

 so work up a sweat a couple days a week _meta_end_dot_

 get some sun _meta_end_dot_

 without vitamin d all sorts of bad things happen _meta_end_dot_

 increased bone density helps a person carry more muscle mass which helps increase the metabolic rate _meta_end_dot_

 see how these things work together _meta_end_question_

 unfortunately as people age they become more sedentary which itself creates risk factors for metabolic syndrome _meta_end_dot_

 i have read articles by doctors who have been on long term supplementary testosterone themselves and they seem perfectly healthy _meta_end_dot_

 i have had patients women actually who have supplemented short term with testosterone for weight loss _meta_end_dot_

 the usage is going up _meta_end_dot_

 people are making experiments of themselves _meta_end_dot_

 i suspect that it will be agreed that testosterone has salubrious effects for men and women short term but like supplementary estrogen the long term effects won t become apparent until after years of use _meta_end_dot_

 manipulating mother nature usually has a downside even if it s not immediately apparent _meta_end_dot_

 what would i recommend to my patients _meta_end_question_

 well short term use could be beneficial but long term the advice would be the same old boring stuff lose weight get fit and eat right _meta_end_dot_
