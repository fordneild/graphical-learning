  f inally something i ve been hoping to see and something which helps restore my faith in real science the american physical society an organization representing nearly _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ physicists has reversed its stance on climate change and is now proclaiming that many of its members disbelieve in human induced global warming _meta_end_dot_

 the aps is also sponsoring public debate on the validity of global warming science _meta_end_dot_

 the leadership of the society had previously called the evidence for global warming incontrovertible in a posting to the aps forum editor jeffrey marque explains there is a considerable presence within the scientific community of people who do not agree with the ipcc conclusion that anthropogenic co_meta_number_ref_ emissions are very probably likely to be primarily responsible for global warming that has occurred since the industrial revolution as noted they re sponsoring a public debate which i would love to hear and see _meta_end_dot_

 wonder if al the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk gore will get an invitation _meta_end_question_

 wonder if al gore would show up if he did and shouldn t he give his nobel back _meta_end_question_

 the aps is opening its debate with the publication of a paper by lord monckton of brenchley which concludes that climate sensitivity the rate of temperature change a given amount of greenhouse gas will cause has been grossly overstated by ipcc modeling _meta_end_dot_

 a low sensitivity implies additional atmospheric co_meta_number_ref_ will have little effect on global climate _meta_end_dot_

 larry gould professor of physics at the university of hartford and chairman of the new england section of the aps called monckton s paper an expose of the ipcc that details numerous exaggerations and extensive errors in an email to dailytech monckton says i was dismayed to discover that the ipcc s _meta_number_ref_ and _meta_number_ref_ reports did not devote chapters to the central climate sensitivity question and did not explain in proper systematic detail the methods by which they evaluated it _meta_end_dot_

 when i began to investigate it seemed that the ipcc was deliberately concealing and obscuring its method according to monckton there is substantial support for his results in the peer reviewed literature most articles on climate sensitivity conclude as i have done that climate sensitivity must be harmlessly low the culprit per monckton _meta_end_question_

 old sol monckton who was the science advisor to britain s thatcher administration says natural variability is the cause of most of the earth s recent warming _meta_end_dot_

 in the past _meta_number_ref_ years the sun was more active than at almost any other time in the past _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ years _meta_end_dot_

 mars jupiter neptune s largest moon and pluto warmed at the same time as earth and here is a rocket scientist from australia who has also decided that co_meta_number_ref_ and agw are no longer the culprit _meta_end_dot_

 but since _meta_number_ref_ new evidence has seriously weakened the case that carbon emissions are the main cause of global warming and by _meta_number_ref_ the evidence was pretty conclusive that carbon played only a minor role and was not the main cause of the recent global warming _meta_end_dot_

 as lord keynes famously said when the facts change i change my mind _meta_end_dot_

 what do you do sir read the whole thing but the second reason he presents pretty flatly says it all _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 there is no evidence to support the idea that carbon emissions cause significant global warming _meta_end_dot_

 none _meta_end_dot_

 there is plenty of evidence that global warming has occurred and theory suggests that carbon emissions should raise temperatures though by how much is hotly disputed but there are no observations by anyone that implicate carbon emissions as a significant cause of the recent global warming _meta_end_dot_

 the ripple caused by a few heretics a couple of years agon is turning into a tsunami against the costly fraud of co_meta_number_ref_ induced agw _meta_end_dot_
