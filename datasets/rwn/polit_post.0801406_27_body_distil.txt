  mike huckabee s campaign manager ed rollins has been ceaselessly pilloried on the right for saying it s gone _meta_end_dot_

 the breakup of what was the reagan coalition social conservatives defense conservatives anti tax conservatives it doesn t mean a whole lot to people anymore while my gut impulse is to disagree with rollins the rapid rise of john mccain the man who has done more to thwart reagan conservatives than any other republican over the last few years is evidence that rollins is right or at a minimum evidence that movement conservatives have been marginalized in the republican party _meta_end_dot_

 amongst grassroots conservatives john mccain s name is an expletive and for good reason because he has made a name for himself by knifing conservatives time and time again for the amusement of his liberal pals in the mainstream media _meta_end_dot_

 i would not support repeal of roe v _meta_end_dot_

 wade john mccain _meta_number_ref_ and on everything else he s a democrat _meta_end_dot_

 in other words we re talking about a man who could fairly be called a rockefeller republican a country club republican a rino or just a toweringly arrogant out of touch d c _meta_end_dot_

 insider who seems to assume that any position he takes is right solely because he happens to hold it _meta_end_dot_

 however what john mccain cannot fairly be called is a conservative _meta_end_dot_

 granted some of his leading competitors for the republican nomination depart from the conservative orthodoxy in a number of ways as well but in their defense none of them has built a career out of smashing a boot into the faces of the very people they re going to need to vote for them in november _meta_end_dot_

 which brings me to the current mood of the republican base as is they re grouchy irritated and unmotivated by the gop s performance of late _meta_end_dot_

 if john mccain becomes the republican party s nominee you have to think conservatives will become utterly despondent _meta_end_dot_

 sure a john mccain vs _meta_end_dot_

 barack obama or john mccain vs _meta_end_dot_

 hillary clinton match up might look good on paper but how are we going to elect someone who makes conservatives despondent _meta_end_question_

 moreover how are we going to elect someone who is richly heartily despised by most of the conservative media _meta_end_question_

 republicans are always complaining that the mainstream media is against them and that the conservative media diligent though it is doesn t have the firepower to adequately combat them _meta_end_dot_

 so what happens when the mainstream media inevitably turns on john mccain and predictably few members of the already outgunned conservative media like mccain well enough to even fight for him _meta_end_question_

 then there s the illegal immigration issue which was the biggest domestic issue of _meta_number_ref_ and figures to be an enormous emotional issue in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 john mccain does not represent the position of most republicans on illegal immigration _meta_end_dot_

 to the contrary he has a position that is functionally identical to that of hillary clinton and barack obama _meta_end_dot_

 so here s a little straight talk for you having john mccain lose in _meta_number_ref_ because he s pro amnesty would probably scare congress so badly that they wouldn t even consider voting on a path to citizenship before _meta_number_ref_ while a john mccain victory would signal to congress that they can go ahead and proceed with amnesty because conservatives don t care about the issue very much _meta_end_dot_

 what kind of trouble _meta_end_question_

 millions and millions of republicans staying home conservatives putting equal priority on fighting the democrats and fighting against the ideas of their own candidate for the presidency a third party effort fund raising for republican candidates dropping even lower than the anemic level it s already at and perhaps losing an extra _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ senate seats and another _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ house seats or perhaps not _meta_end_dot_

 after all this has been a wildly unpredictable election season and gloom and doom scenarios often don t come to pass _meta_end_dot_

 however when a political party selects a man as a leader who is wildly out of step with the views of the majority of people who belong to it it doesn t take a rocket scientist to figure out that party is going to have one hell of a rough time _meta_end_dot_

 if that s the road that the republican party goes down in _meta_number_ref_ may god help us all _meta_end_dot_
