  they re lining up for hours to vote in zimbabwe today _meta_end_dot_

 the question is whether the votes will count _meta_end_dot_

 there have already been widespread irregularities _meta_end_dot_

 zimbabwe has become a textbook example of how to destroy an economy through heavy handed governmental intervention in the free market including forced redistribution of wealth farms were taken from white farmers to give to blacks and foolish stopgap measures such as price controls which not only failed to stop raging inflation but predictably created shortages and black markets _meta_end_dot_

 most of zimbabwe s current troubles can be laid at the feet of one man robert mugabe _meta_end_dot_

 harare zimbabwe zimbabweans lined up for hours saturday to vote in elections that present president robert mugabe with his toughest political challenge in _meta_number_ref_ years in power _meta_end_dot_

 voting was generally reported as peaceful but were some complaints of irregularities and minor violence _meta_end_dot_

 the opposition accuses mugabe of plotting to steal the election _meta_end_dot_

 mugabe told reporters he would accept whatever results emerged and rejected the charges that he had already orchestrated his own victory _meta_end_dot_

 we don t rig elections he said _meta_end_dot_

 the economic collapse of zimbabwe once the region s breadbasket has dominated the campaign _meta_end_dot_

 the opposition accuses mugabe of misrule and dictatorship _meta_end_dot_

 mugabe appealing to national pride blames the west and charges his opponents as being stooges for former colonial ruler britain _meta_end_dot_

 in southern bulawayo an opposition stronghold _meta_number_ref_ year old moffat simon mabhena was among many who lined up to vote hours before the scheduled _meta_number_ref_ a m _meta_end_dot_

 poll opening _meta_end_dot_

 the message is very clear we want to see change in this country mabhena said _meta_end_dot_

 i have been here since _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ a m _meta_end_dot_

 and it s because i want to see robert mugabe out last july the government of zimbabwe was imposing price controls in an effort to stop galloping inflation _meta_end_dot_

 it was a predictable failure _meta_end_dot_

 as i wrote at the time things are going just swimmingly in zimbabwe where the very government responsible for runaway inflation is attempting to override the laws of supply and demand by mandating that all prices be slashed _meta_end_dot_

 yeah that ll work _meta_end_dot_

 let s check in and see how it s going so far shall we _meta_end_question_

 plain clothes police sought to enforce zimbabwe s new price controls by raiding shops yesterday as president robert mugabe s regime waged a desperate struggle against soaring inflation _meta_end_dot_

 they roughed up shop owners and staff and arrested _meta_number_ref_ businessmen _meta_end_dot_

 shoppers swarmed over supermarket shelves in the capital harare intent on grabbing bargains _meta_end_dot_

 ministers claim that the inflation rate of _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ per cent the highest in the world is solely caused by greedy shopkeepers raising their prices for no good reason _meta_end_dot_

 propaganda tries to portray businessmen as the true authors of the economic collapse deflecting blame from mr mugabe _meta_end_dot_

 but economists say that the prime cause of inflation is the government s huge budget deficit which it deals with by printing more money _meta_end_dot_

 this immense borrowing requirement is in turn the result of the wider economic failure caused mainly by the seizure of white owned farms _meta_end_dot_

 instead of dealing with the deficit the regime has imposed draconian price controls _meta_end_dot_

 last week the authorities ordered shops to cut basic food prices by _meta_number_ref_ per cent after retail prices had risen by _meta_number_ref_ per cent in only seven days _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 shelves in supermarkets across harare are swiftly emptying and police in full riot gear linger outside _meta_end_dot_

 the new controls force supermarkets to sell food at below its cost from wholesalers _meta_end_dot_

 unless the regime relents there will be food shortages empty shelves and eventually the closure of all shops _meta_end_dot_

 we won t be restocking _meta_end_dot_

 if need be we might have to close shop rather than stick to government prices said the manager of one store _meta_end_dot_

 doesn t anybody understand basic economics in zimbabwe _meta_end_question_

 in october after having imposed the price controls zimbabwe ran out of bread zimbabwe s bakeries have shut and supermarkets have warned there will be no bread for the foreseeable future as the government admitted that wheat production had collapsed following the seizure of white owned farms _meta_end_dot_

 the agricultural ministry announcement that the wheat harvest is only about a third of what is required and that imports are held up by lack of hard currency came as a deadline passed today for the last white farmers to leave their land or face prosecution for trespass _meta_end_dot_

 the maize harvest is expected to be equally dire and price controls to contain hyperinflation have emptied the stores of most other foodstuffs _meta_end_dot_

 the world food programme says at least _meta_number_ref_ million people one in four of the population will need food aid in the coming months _meta_end_dot_

 it describes hunger in some parts of the country which used to be a food exporter as acutely serious _meta_end_dot_

 around the world too many on the left still believe that unequal distribution of wealth is the primary explanation for intractable problems of hunger and poverty _meta_end_dot_

 they support policies such as heavily taxing the rich and redistributing some of that wealth to the poor _meta_end_dot_

 they do not realize that poverty is a symptom of deeper troubles not the cause _meta_end_dot_

 a nation s poverty is a usually a symptom of bad governmental and economic policies including laws that interfere with the free market and destroy incentives to produce _meta_end_dot_

 corruption violence and lack of basic human freedom don t help either _meta_end_dot_

 this is what robert mugabe has done to us turned us into a nation of peddlers and beggars she said flatly allowing her thoughts to then wander off into the future _meta_end_dot_

 if he remains we will just die zimbabwe started out as a prosperous breakbasket _meta_end_dot_

 now thanks to its forcible redistribution of wealth it has turned itself into an economic basket case _meta_end_dot_

 a nation that once helped feed the world has no bread to feed its own people _meta_end_dot_

 there is no surer way to make everyone poor than to take from the rich and give to the poor _meta_end_dot_
