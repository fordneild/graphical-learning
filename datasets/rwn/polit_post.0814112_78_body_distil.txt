  it was bound to happen _meta_end_dot_

 the boomers got old _meta_end_dot_

 please note _meta_end_dot_

 i didn t say that they grew up _meta_end_dot_

 now that i don t think will ever happen _meta_end_dot_

 the boomers got old and they re taking over some places _meta_end_dot_

 for example when i visited upstate new york this last december we visited friends who live near elmira and something strange struck me there were no young people _meta_end_dot_

 even in the new neighborhoods only one or two homes had children _meta_end_dot_

 the rest of the homes were filled with retirees _meta_end_dot_

 and here s what s happening business is dying _meta_end_dot_

 well it makes sense _meta_end_dot_

 the younger population is moving out and moving south for jobs _meta_end_dot_

 they re multiplying like field mice on testosterone around here so don t fret too much _meta_end_dot_

 still the old people phenomena has disturbing implications for the northern states _meta_end_dot_

 consider this hospitals are closing obstetrics wards and converting them to acute care _meta_end_dot_

 local governments and other social service providers are adjusting to the emergence of entire neighborhoods where the average age is soaring and private foundations are awarding scholarships to retain students and attract new ones _meta_end_dot_

 in pittsburgh public school enrollment plummeted from about _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ two decades ago to about _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ and continues shrinking by about _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ a year _meta_end_dot_

 who will care for the old people _meta_end_question_

 there aren t robots yet _meta_end_dot_

 who will pay taxes _meta_end_question_

 more money will be needed to care for people who can t care for themselves just as business moves out and young people seek work where there are jobs in tax friendly states like texas _meta_end_dot_

 i postulated a couple years ago that there s an obvious solution death with dignity _meta_end_dot_

 that s code for assisted suicide _meta_end_dot_

 it will be called end of life services _meta_end_dot_

 i have a great company name already thought up death wishes _meta_end_dot_

 nice ring to it _meta_end_dot_

 but seriously the biggest generation will be relying on the smallest generation in their elder years _meta_end_dot_

 social security won t last _meta_end_dot_

 eugenics doesn t appeal for moral reasons _meta_end_dot_

 the old people will need care there will be a shortage of workers pay would normally increase but old people can t afford the expense and the government will keep wages low _meta_end_dot_

 it won t be very appealing to do the work for not much pay _meta_end_dot_

 any solutions _meta_end_question_
