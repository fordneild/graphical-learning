  question a us soldier currently deployed to the iraq theater of operations and actively supporting operation iraqi freedom i have followed with great interest the rumors of general david h _meta_end_dot_

 petraeus possibly running for president of the united states of america upon his retirement from the us army _meta_end_dot_

 as you are a consistent blogger who demonstrates a clear and accurate understanding of politics and world events your opinion is highly regarded by many in the conservative blogosphere _meta_end_dot_

 i wanted your assessment of general petraeus s campaign whether he would be a candidate conservatives would rally around and the likelihood of him being elected _meta_end_dot_

 do you know anything of his opinions regarding key conservative issues aside from national security _meta_end_question_

 i imagine he would appeal to conservatives on the basis of foreign policy as well as fiscal issues but i know nothing about his stance on social issues _meta_end_dot_

 your assessment sir if you please applemacjimmy answer politics is much more of a brutal and unforgiving business than it used to be and for that reason i think it would be extremely difficult for a political novice even one with as much cachet as petraeus has to become president of the united states _meta_end_dot_

 on the other hand if he wanted to run for let s say governor or senator somewhere i think he would be a very strong candidate who could expect to get ferocious support from conservatives as long as he turns out to be to the right of center _meta_end_dot_
