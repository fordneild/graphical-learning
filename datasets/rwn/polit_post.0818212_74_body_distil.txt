  a british family chose ivf and screened embryos that had a breast cancer gene by screening out embryos carrying the gene called brca _meta_number_ref_ the couple from london will eliminate the hereditary disease from their lineage _meta_end_dot_

 about _meta_percent_ref_ of the _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ cases of breast cancer diagnosed in britain each year are estimated to be caused by the brca _meta_number_ref_ and brca _meta_number_ref_ genes both of which can be detected in embryos _meta_end_dot_

 doctors say thousands of cases of breast cancer could be avoided by screening embryos using the technique called preimplantation diagnosis pgd _meta_end_dot_

 eleven embryos were created _meta_end_dot_

 six had the bad gene _meta_end_dot_

 six were destroyed _meta_end_dot_

 two were implanted _meta_end_dot_

 one malfunctioned _meta_end_dot_

 two were frozen for future use _meta_end_dot_

 as a doctor i find the notion of avoiding the future pain of such a disastrous disease _meta_number_ref_ _meta_percent_ref_ of those with this gene end up with the cancer exciting and hopeful _meta_end_dot_

 but i shudder too at the implications and the callous actions taken _meta_end_dot_

 creating eleven lives destroying six so that one ostensibly healthy one is created _meta_end_dot_

 it s the destruction that is so problematic _meta_end_dot_

 no one would dream of having eleven children and then dumping six overboard because they had a _meta_number_ref_ _meta_percent_ref_ chance of suffering down the road _meta_end_dot_

 doctors and parents choosing this procedure view embryos as specimens not life _meta_end_dot_

 with time genetic markers will identify everything from depression to homosexuality to heart disease _meta_end_dot_

 given the rationale used in genetic selection there will be no ethical reason to prevent its use for nearly any dysfunction _meta_end_dot_

 destroying embryos is okay in order to have a healthy baby agree disagree pollcode com free polls dr _meta_end_dot_
