  yesterday after being inspired by ben smith at the politico i created a poll question for rwn s readers that read does barack obama show the proper patriotism for someone who wants to be the president of the united states _meta_end_question_

 early on roughly _meta_percent_ref_ to _meta_percent_ref_ of rwn s readers were saying no obama doesn t show the proper patriotism for someone who wants to be the president of the united states that deserves a little applause doesn t it _meta_end_question_

 after all it does prove that obama is capable of unifying conservatives of course they were being unified around the idea that he wasn t patriotic enough to be president of the united states but still _meta_end_dot_

 then later in the day on monday ben smith at the politico linked to the poll and sent liberals flooding over to the page to vote _meta_end_dot_

 the result _meta_end_question_

 at the time i am writing this _meta_percent_ref_ of the people who have voted agree that obama doesn t show the proper patriotism for someone who wants to be the president of the united states once again this just proves obama can unify the conservatives from rwn and the liberals from the politico _meta_percent_ref_ of us at least around the idea that he doesn t love his country enough to be the president _meta_end_dot_

 now that s the sort of unity and cooperation obama promised he would bring to the table _meta_end_exclamation_

 let s hope the libs from the politico don t screw up this lovely moment of bi partisan harmony by continuing to falsely claim that obama is patriotic _meta_end_dot_

 after all folks obama said he s going to end divisiveness in this country so we should all be willing to agree that he s not a man who has any sort of respect or affection for the united states _meta_end_dot_
