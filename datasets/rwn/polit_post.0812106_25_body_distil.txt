  if you have a few bucks to spare woody jenkins could use your support _meta_end_dot_

 jenkins is a conservative candidate running for the _meta_number_ref_th u s _meta_end_dot_

 congressional district seat in louisiana which is a republican district and he s in a close race _meta_end_dot_

 this seat is currently held by richard baker a republican who s retiring and if jenkins can t pull it out in louisiana s crazy primary system the seat will likely be taken by a moderate democrat who will inevitably as moderate democrats always seem to do vote with the liberal on almost every close vote _meta_end_dot_

 this is a seat the gop can hold and woody jenkins is a guy we want in congress _meta_end_dot_

 hopefully you can chip in a few bucks to help make that happen _meta_end_dot_
