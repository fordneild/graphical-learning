  a gaffe is when a politician tells the truth michael kinsley yesterday geraldine ferraro committed a gaffe by telling the truth about barack obama _meta_end_dot_

 if obama was a white man he would not be in this position _meta_end_dot_

 and if he was a woman of any color he would not be in this position _meta_end_dot_

 he happens to be very lucky to be who he is _meta_end_dot_

 and the country is caught up in the concept how can anyone even deny this obvious fact about barack obama _meta_end_question_

 the majority of his fan base is made up of black people who are voting for barack because he s black and guilt ridden white people who are voting for barack so they can prove to all their friends that they re not racists _meta_end_dot_

 then you add to that the republicans and independents who like him because he s a post racial black candidate and you ve probably accounted for what _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_percent_ref_ of obama s support so far in the primaries _meta_end_question_

 in other words if barack obama had been white he d have been laughed off as too inexperienced to even be running for the job and he d have been relegated to the bottom of the democratic pile with dennis kucinich joe biden and chris dodd _meta_end_dot_

 does that mean that there aren t democratic racists who won t vote for barack because he s black _meta_end_question_

 not at all _meta_end_dot_

 to the contrary there are plenty of people like that supporting hillary _meta_end_dot_

 but the honest truth is that barack s race is much more of an asset than a hindrance to him so much so that if he weren t black he wouldn t have the slightest chance to win the democratic nomination _meta_end_dot_

 ps is that unfair _meta_end_question_

 some people may think so but that s what life is like _meta_end_dot_

 every politician has different strengths and weaknesses that help them _meta_end_dot_

 if john mccain hadn t been a pow would he be the gop nominee _meta_end_question_

 if hillary clinton hadn t ridden her husband s coat tails would she be in the hunt for the democratic nomination _meta_end_question_

 if ted kennedy hadn t been born a kennedy would he be in the senate _meta_end_question_

 if george bush hadn t been a bush would he be in the white house _meta_end_question_

 if arnold schwarzenegger hadn t been in the movies would he be governor of california _meta_end_question_

 if condi rice weren t a black woman would anyone even be talking about her as a potential vice presidential pick _meta_end_question_

 for that matter would geraldine ferarro have ever been considered for the veep position if she were a man _meta_end_question_

 would ronald reagan one of the greatest presidents of all time have ever made it to the white house if he hadn t been an actor _meta_end_question_

 you can go on and on with these examples _meta_end_dot_

 but what it all comes down to is that there are all sorts of things about politicians that shouldn t matter but do _meta_end_dot_

 all you can really do about it is accept reality and deal with it as you find it _meta_end_dot_

 update _meta_number_ref_ bonus ferraro any time anybody does anything that in any way pulls this campaign down and says let s address reality and the problems we re facing in this world you re accused of being racist so you have to shut up _meta_end_dot_

 racism works in two different directions _meta_end_dot_

 i really think they re attacking me because i m white _meta_end_dot_

 how s that actually i can t agree that they re attacking ferraro because she s white _meta_end_dot_

 they re attacking her because she dared to say something negative about the all knowing obamamessiah and the racism charge is the easiest way to fire back _meta_end_dot_

 incidentally republicans better get used to that charge because if obama is the nominee it s going to be leveled at pretty much any and every republican who disagrees with obama in any way which is pretty ironic isn t it _meta_end_question_

 here you have the first post racial black candidate for the presidency on the left _meta_end_dot_

 he doesn t ask people to vote for him because he s black even if they do he doesn t use his race as an excuse and he doesn t accuse people who disagree with him of being racists but his supporters are constantly doing all those things and he s content to let them do so _meta_end_dot_

 does that along with his anti white spiritual mentor jeremiah wright suggest that maybe obama isn t very sincere about his beliefs _meta_end_question_

 i think it does _meta_end_dot_

 update _meta_number_ref_ from the comments section heck if obama were white he d be john edwards cavalierx although obama and edwards are very similar politicians i think that s actually too kind to obama _meta_end_dot_

 edwards is more accomplished more experienced and had a significantly higher profile than obama when this whole thing started _meta_end_dot_

 if obama was white he would have been considered to be an inferior candidate to edwards _meta_end_dot_
