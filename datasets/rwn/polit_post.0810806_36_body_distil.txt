  you ve got to love the implication present in this post from daily kos diarist sebastian likes to rattle cages the united states of america are on the brink of a major revolution _meta_end_dot_

 i am not talking about some fuzzy internet revolution or similar hogwash but the real mccoy _meta_end_dot_

 i mean armed uprising riots civil war _meta_end_dot_

 the full monty _meta_end_dot_

 i know i know you are going to say that this is impossible no way i am being pessimistic etc _meta_end_dot_

 this is outrageous but not surprising as the ckickens are coming home to roost and after exploiting pretty much the whole globe and now facing stiff competion of other players like china india and brazil the us corporations have resorted to the last market they have not sucked dry until recently the american homeland _meta_end_dot_

 the people are understandably outraged and demand action welcome to the club _meta_end_dot_

 do you now understand why all over the world american flags have been burned _meta_end_dot_

 in previous elections it was easy to distract you only had to find a big enough gotcha or push enough buttons to distract from a pressing issue _meta_end_dot_

 however this time there are not enough buttons to push and by panically pushing all buttons hard and often this tool is being overused and backfires _meta_end_dot_

 this election and the way an obama administration is going to perform is the crossroads for the american nation _meta_end_dot_

 either reform or revolution _meta_end_dot_

 the powers to be are not going to cede their powers voluntarily _meta_end_dot_

 they never do _meta_end_dot_

 if obama fails there will be someone else and there is no guarantee that this is not going to be someone like lenin or worse hitler _meta_end_dot_

 but after so much gloom cheer up _meta_end_exclamation_

 here come the good news if the nation and people in question were anyone else but america and the americans i would stick a fork in them _meta_end_dot_

 the americans however have proven to be a very special people and to have the incredible ability to do the right thing after trying all other options to quote winston c _meta_end_dot_

 here _meta_end_dot_

 obama is going to be the next president and you can count yourself lucky _meta_end_dot_

 you are probably the luckiest b stards in the universe to have such a leader emerging then when you need him the most _meta_end_dot_

 on the other hand you should never forget what is at stake and what awaits should you fail so vote obama or it s an armed uprising riots civil war presumably led by the kos kids which happily means that the revolution is guaranteed to fail _meta_end_dot_

 ps please appoint keith olbermann as the revolution s head general please please please _meta_end_exclamation_
