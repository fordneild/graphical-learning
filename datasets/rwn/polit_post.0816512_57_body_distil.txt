  there is no significant man made global warming _meta_end_dot_

 there has not been any in the past there is none now and there is no reason to fear any in the future _meta_end_dot_

 the climate of earth is changing _meta_end_dot_

 it has always changed _meta_end_dot_

 but mankind s activities have not overwhelmed or significantly modified the natural forces _meta_end_dot_

 worldwide there was a significant natural warming trend in the _meta_number_ref_ s and _meta_number_ref_ s as a solar cycle peaked with lots of sunspots and solar flares _meta_end_dot_

 that ended in _meta_number_ref_ and now the sun has gone quiet with fewer and fewer sun spots and the global temperatures have gone into decline _meta_end_dot_

 earth has cooled for almost ten straight years _meta_end_dot_

 so i ask al gore where s the global warming _meta_end_question_

 the cooling trend is so strong that recently the head of the united nation s intergovernmental panel on climate change had to acknowledge it _meta_end_dot_

 he speculated that nature has temporarily overwhelmed mankind s warming and it may be ten years or so before the warming returns _meta_end_dot_

 oh really _meta_end_dot_

 we are supposed to be in a panic about man made global warming and the whole thing takes a ten year break because of the lack of sun spots _meta_end_dot_

 if this weren t so serious it would be laughable john coleman
