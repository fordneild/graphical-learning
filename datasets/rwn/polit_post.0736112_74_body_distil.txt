  poor will smith _meta_end_dot_

 he got in trouble for some comments he made about adolph hitler that were taken out of context will smith has stunned the world by declaring that even nazi dictator adolf hitler was essentially a good person _meta_end_dot_

 the i am legend star _meta_number_ref_ is determined to see the best in people and is convinced the former german leader did not fully understand the extent of the pain and suffering his actions would cause during his time in power in the _meta_number_ref_s and _meta_number_ref_s _meta_end_dot_

 he says even hitler didn t wake up going let me do the most evil thing i can do today i think he woke up in the morning and using a twisted backwards logic he set out to do what he thought was good stuff like that just needs reprogramming first of all there s a minor point that i want to make will smith did not say that adolf hitler was essentially a good person he said that hitler errantly thought he was doing good which is something different entirely _meta_end_dot_

 however on to the real point of this post will smith s real mistake was taking the liberal view of evil to its logical conclusion _meta_end_dot_

 aside from republicans america and a few people allied with america or people that they like to compare republicans to like hitler liberals treat everyone as if they re essentially good people _meta_end_dot_

 they excuse the most evil group of people on earth the palestinians for advocating genocide and deliberately murdering innocent israelis _meta_end_dot_

 they re constantly crying and moaning about people in prison like mumia abu jamal who they think have gotten a raw deal from society _meta_end_dot_

 they re eternally convinced that the most vile dictators on earth from kim jung il to mahmoud ahmadinejad to fidel castro only have problems with us because we don t know how to talk to them _meta_end_dot_

 if we d only say the right things to them they d understand we re good people too and all of our problems with them would go away _meta_end_exclamation_

 they even make the same sort of excuses for al qaeda _meta_end_dot_

 what do you think the meaning of why do they hate us really is _meta_end_question_

 it s that they think they re decent reasonable people at heart who ve been driven to do things we consider evil because of us _meta_end_dot_

 so there again was will smith s mistake he applied the exact same logic that liberals use every day of the week without understanding that it s politically unpopular to say the same thing about hitler that liberals say about most of the other evil people on the planet _meta_end_dot_

 ps i caught i am legend this week end and really enjoyed it _meta_end_dot_
