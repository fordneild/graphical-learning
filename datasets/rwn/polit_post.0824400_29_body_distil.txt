  just some stuff i ve been noticing since the news broke about sarah palin _meta_end_dot_

 apart from sharing blogger friend phil s sense of alarm that my age is very close to that of one of our fifty state governors _meta_end_dot_

 and training my brain to remember when the eyeballs see palin in written form that the name rhymes with sailin _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 i ve said it before and i ll say it again hold outs like me are vindicated _meta_end_dot_

 if we all banded together and showed our support as my right winger brethren were telling me today we d have a mccain lieberman ticket _meta_end_dot_

 i guaran d_meta_beep_ref_n tee it _meta_end_dot_

 when people who own decisions are sleeping restlessly or not sleeping at all good things happen _meta_end_dot_

 and in politics if you want to decide things don t _meta_end_dot_

 nobody gives up anything to make friends with someone who is already thought of as a friend _meta_end_dot_

 especially a devoted loyal friend _meta_end_dot_

 it just doesn t make strategic sense to do that _meta_end_dot_

 loyalty is not rewarded here and that s why people don t like politics very much _meta_end_dot_

 nervous nellies and nay sayers like me gave you sarah palin _meta_end_dot_

 you re welcome _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 no question about it the chicks are excited _meta_end_dot_

 it s easter sunday in the church of the goddess _meta_end_dot_

 this was a very smart move for mccain _meta_end_dot_

 we re talking millions maybe tens of millions of votes _meta_end_dot_

 dare i hope california will turn red _meta_end_question_

 yeah that s still far fetched in fact obama still might win but it shows the scope of what an advantage this is that california going for mccain has become a possibility worth pondering _meta_end_dot_

 i just hope with all this estrogen lathering up the shirts are still being ironed and the samriches are still being made _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 there is some consternation about the real possibility that history will be made by a pro life conservative republican woman _meta_end_dot_

 being from a planet called earth and having warm blood i m naturally inclined to accept there was something insincere from the very get go about the whole get a woman in there thing _meta_end_dot_

 otherwise palin s ideology would inspire no such squeamishness _meta_end_dot_

 people who face this conundrum need to examine their own motivations and examine them hard _meta_end_dot_

 they are not quite so much in favor of equality as they ve been fooling themselves into thinking _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 the child born with downs syndrome _meta_end_dot_

 i didn t mention it for two reasons _meta_end_dot_

 nobody would be mentioning it if she was a man and if i was the child i wouldn t be too pleased years down the road with all these archives of articles about how my mom is the second coming of florence nightingale just because she didn t kill me _meta_end_dot_

 c mon she s pro life and she isn t a _meta_beep_ref_ _meta_end_exclamation_

 hypocrite _meta_end_dot_

 good on her but some things don t need to be talked about ad nauseum _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 a lot of gals are saying what hillary said _meta_end_dot_

 some are considering voting for the mccain ticket even though palin s policies would be terrible for the country what a bunch of disgraceful embittered old cows _meta_end_dot_

 i hope they vote for mccain palin and then never vote in anything again _meta_end_dot_

 they just admitted to wanting to hurt the country to support a woman _meta_end_exclamation_

 it s a national disgrace _meta_end_dot_

 oh and yeah hillary still can t stop talking that way all the time _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 a lot of references to palin s speech which frankly i found offensive _meta_end_dot_

 and not just a little bit _meta_end_dot_

 glass ceiling shmass shmeiling yes it s irritating when you are judged by your class membership because you have no control over that _meta_end_dot_

 you rise above it by running on your individual attributes _meta_end_dot_

 and people aren t actively keeping you out of things when they re being mentally lazy it s a passive obstruction not an active one _meta_end_dot_

 men run for office because in order to run for office you have to leave yourself open to confrontation attack and ridicule _meta_end_dot_

 women are up to enduring ridicule occasionally like an occasional cat is willing to go for a swim _meta_end_dot_

 palin i believe understands this was a load _meta_end_dot_

 i see it as something she had to say _meta_end_dot_

 she had to hit a home run on this and that was the magic elixir _meta_end_dot_

 it reflects on the rest of us not so much on her _meta_end_dot_

 i ll look past it _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 i do not see anyone falling for the inexperienced talking point _meta_end_dot_

 just a handful of dailykos folks that s about it _meta_end_dot_

 i m still surprised the obama camp had the big brass balls to trot that one out _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 i do not see anyone falling for the town of _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ talking point _meta_end_dot_

 not at all _meta_end_dot_

 and this idea of having everyone who lives in a town with _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ or fewer people call fax the obama campaign is a fantastic idea _meta_end_dot_

 i ll be paying close attention to that one _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 a lot of guys would hit that interesting that this prurient desire sports just a hint of the forbidden fruit about it when childish schoolgirls squeal around obama as if he were the reincarnation of johnny fontaine there s a slightly different connotation involved _meta_end_dot_

 anyway i think gov _meta_end_dot_

 palin is pleased with what she s got at home _meta_end_dot_

 i m happy with what i ve got at home too so i ll follow her lead _meta_end_dot_

 but no question the lady is a looker _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 if i didn t know one thing about sarah palin or any of the other players and didn t give a rat s a_meta_beep_ref_ about conservatives and liberals i d vote mccain palin because there s someone on that ticket who isn t a senator _meta_end_dot_

 i m a little surprised mccain hasn t been talking that one up _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 i m looking forward to seeing palin repeat some of what george w _meta_end_dot_

 bush said about defending the country vs _meta_end_dot_

 appeasing foreigners following up the course of this nation does not depend on the decisions of others that line drew applause _meta_end_dot_

 so take that bush s third term thing and shove it down obama s throat _meta_end_dot_

 something along the lines of yep that s our goal you ve got the political capital to do that now _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 i do not see any conservatives expressing newfound reluctance now that they have to have to vote for a girl _meta_end_dot_

 i have not seen so much of a speck of evidence for that _meta_end_dot_

 c mon guys we re supposed to be a bunch of d mned sexists here _meta_end_dot_

 doesn t living up to a reputation mean anything to anyone anymore _meta_end_question_

 well i ll live up to mine i m an equal opportunity sexist _meta_end_dot_

 palin s a good running mate for mccain but if somewhere there was a man who would make a better one i d say he made the wrong choice _meta_end_dot_

 there isn t _meta_end_dot_

 she was as i said before the best choice he could ve made and being a woman has nothing to do with being a good vice president _meta_end_dot_

 i hope while the republicans gulp this intoxicating elixir of identity politics by the gallon they don t get punch drunk on it like the democrat party has been since the _meta_number_ref_ s _meta_end_dot_

 but they probably will _meta_end_dot_

 that s bad for the g o p over the long term because it diminishes what distinguishes them from the democrats _meta_end_dot_

 but good for the country if palin shows the kind of leadership she s been showing in alaska _meta_end_dot_

 that s a trade i ll take _meta_end_dot_

 i have a dream that one day our children and our children s children will judge each other by the content of their character and not by the configuration of their genitals _meta_end_dot_

 i wonder if my girlfriend from third grade has ever thought of me _meta_end_dot_

 probably not _meta_end_dot_

 but chicks in glasses have meant something completely different to me over the last _meta_number_ref_ years than they did in the eight years that came before _meta_end_dot_

 that s just an added plus for sarah _meta_end_dot_
