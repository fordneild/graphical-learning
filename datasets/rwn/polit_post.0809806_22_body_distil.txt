  it s hard to know exactly how the democratic party is going to get out of the jam that they ve created for themselves in florida and michigan but this isn t going to be it senator obama firmly believes that the michigan delegation should be seated in denver _meta_end_dot_

 a _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ split of the delegates is an eminently fair solution especially since originally senator clinton herself said the michigan primary wouldn t count for anything it s now up to the clinton campaign they can agree to a fair resolution or they can continue trying to score political points and change the rules _meta_end_dot_

 it s time to move forward _meta_end_dot_

 senator clinton should accept an equitable solution that allows michigan to participate fully in the convention said obama campaign manager david plouffe now let s see how does that mesh with democratic rhetoric about making every vote count _meta_end_question_

 in michigan obama wasn t even on the ballot and the actual breakdown of the almost _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ votes was _meta_percent_ref_ for clinton and _meta_percent_ref_ for uncommitted granted the fair thing to do would be not to count michigan at all but that s not what obama wants _meta_end_dot_

 instead a guy who got zero votes in the actual election and whose campaign helped thwart a revote wants to have half the delegates just handed to him on a silver platter presumably because he s such a wonderful fellow _meta_end_dot_

 what arrogance _meta_end_dot_
