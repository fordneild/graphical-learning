  back on july _meta_number_ref_th i mentioned the democrats are going to be having platform meetings from july _meta_number_ref_th to july _meta_number_ref_ which is a good way to keep the unhinged off the streets to come up with the democrat party platform _meta_end_dot_

 i was not particularly nice about it apparently senator neophyte isn t capable of actually figuring out where he stands anymore so he has to ask others to do it _meta_end_dot_

 hope _meta_end_exclamation_

 change _meta_end_exclamation_

 absence of leadership and vision _meta_end_exclamation_

 so what do i see while perusing ye olde bloglines at the american princess place _meta_end_question_

 e m _meta_end_dot_

 has a post up about the gop soliciting ideas for its own platform and she writes the techcrunch article asks why the democrats haven t launched a similar measure to which i respond two reasons one they aren t stupid enough to advertise to the entire internet that their party lacks a cohesive platform which will drive voters to the polling booths in november and two they probably had something similar on mybarackobama com they realized it failed and went back to traditional social networking _meta_end_dot_

 sigh _meta_end_dot_

 the rnc website here and facebook app here is doing the same dumb thing as the democrats allowing the masses to pick the platform _meta_end_dot_

 on the surface that is not a bad idea involving the voters in picking the what the parties should focus on _meta_end_dot_

 then you start thinking and realize that _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 people who have no intention of voting republican are going to register and leave comments _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 republicans are just not in to the whole internet social sheepling like democrats as we are too independent minded and _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 maybe the rnc should already friggin know what the republican voters want them to do by now _meta_end_dot_

 oh and _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 how about some leadership rnc number _meta_number_ref_ applies to democrats as well _meta_end_dot_

 so what are the policy positions that are important to people who vote republican _meta_end_question_

 limited government stopping illegal immigration national security stopping gay marriage love of america reducing the scope of the federal government low taxes reducing government spending wiser and more cost efficient spending defeating islamic extremism doing away with some federal departments such as the dept _meta_end_dot_

 of education support of the _meta_number_ref_nd amendment the fair tax drilling on american soil support for christian ideals support of the family workfare not welfare re institution of the _meta_number_ref_th and _meta_number_ref_th amendments _meta_end_dot_

 obviously not all float every ones boat and there are certainly more _meta_end_dot_

 for those who vote dem _meta_end_question_

 impeachment socialized nationalized healthcare fixing anthropogenic global warming putting america s security in the hands of the u n pie in the sky energy programs increasing taxes on the wealthy i e those in a different tax bracket then the responder more federal government involvement in everything except the military which needs to be reduced legalizing illegal immigrants instituting the fairness doctrine gun restriction reducing religion military action that has no bearing on national security but running away when something goes wrong treating with terrorist leaders and surrender in iraq _meta_end_dot_

 what did i miss _meta_end_question_

 in all seriousness when it comes to deciding what to concentrate on experts will say to concentrate on no more the _meta_number_ref_ things otherwise focus gets lost _meta_end_dot_

 if you could pick three specific things to get done first what would they be _meta_end_question_

 for me reduce federal spending which can be combined with wiser and more efficient spending one part would be to change the government monetary allocation system which is a long post in and of itself go hard after islamic extremists in all countries that support them and drilling on american soil combined with alternative energy research _meta_end_dot_

 what are your top _meta_number_ref_ to start with _meta_end_question_

 cross posted at pirate s cove _meta_end_dot_
