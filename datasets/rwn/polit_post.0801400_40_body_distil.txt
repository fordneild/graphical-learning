  surging in south carolina and it s not just that the other candidates stink for various and sundry reasons which i ll run through momentarily or that he s the best of the worst or something _meta_end_dot_

 i want fred for his own reasons _meta_end_dot_

 let s run through the problems with the other guys john mccain he marches to his own little drummer who doesn t know the conservative rhythm _meta_end_dot_

 of course there s mccain feingold that nifty little piece of legislation whose chief beneficiary was george soros but there s this other little thing his only consistent conservative feature is his military stance which i admit i admire _meta_end_dot_

 it s not enough _meta_end_dot_

 mitt romney tall presidential looking good hair smart _meta_end_dot_

 i should love him but i don t _meta_end_dot_

 my suspicion isn t evangelical in nature ewww he s a mormon he frightens me _meta_end_exclamation_

 it s more ewww he succeeded in massachusetts he frightens me _meta_end_exclamation_

 also he came across as bitchy in the last debate _meta_end_dot_

 rudy giuliani i like him _meta_end_dot_

 he gives the press heck _meta_end_dot_

 he won t back off a fight _meta_end_dot_

 he possesses the right kind of moral indignation at psychopaths routinely given a pass _meta_end_dot_

 still he s no conservative _meta_end_dot_

 but he s better than most _meta_end_dot_

 ron paul he s a loon _meta_end_dot_

 mike huckabee he s a loon with a tv evangelist grin but boy can he smile _meta_end_dot_

 his post loss speech in new hampshire was euphoric hope like obama but pasty white and boomerish _meta_end_dot_

 and then there s fred thompson _meta_end_dot_

 fred thompson has it all _meta_end_dot_

 he has conservative cred _meta_end_dot_

 he has experience _meta_end_dot_

 he can communicate _meta_end_dot_

 he gives journalists the respect they deserve _meta_end_dot_

 but there s more _meta_end_dot_

 a president has to have a certain je ne sais quoi _meta_end_dot_

 fred has it _meta_end_dot_

 he s middle american _meta_end_dot_

 he has the slight lilt _meta_end_dot_

 he comes across as real _meta_end_dot_

 he s likable _meta_end_dot_

 guys can imagine going out for a beer with him _meta_end_dot_

 girls dig him _meta_end_dot_

 now that above assessment might bug you but it s important especially in the general election _meta_end_dot_

 voters dig alpha males and so do certain bloggers _meta_end_dot_

 can you imagine going for a beer with romney huckabee or paul _meta_end_question_

 no _meta_end_dot_

 how about edwards clinton or obama _meta_end_question_

 maybe obama but it d be a martini or glass of wine let s be real here _meta_end_dot_

 giuliani could have a good time at the bar but aren t you just a little afraid he might go on a bender _meta_end_question_

 thompson would have a drink talk sports know the waitress name and go home to his wife _meta_end_dot_

 about women _meta_end_dot_

 i dig thompson _meta_end_dot_

 he s not conventionally cute _meta_end_dot_

 heck none of the candidates are that great looking save romney _meta_end_dot_

 thompson has that easy talk the relaxed authority that is fun to be around _meta_end_dot_

 he s the guy girls choose and the other dudes marvel _meta_end_dot_

 i happen to think that the more people learn about thompson the more they ll like _meta_end_dot_

 soon we ll have a huckabust _meta_end_dot_

 and then romney will lose his zip _meta_end_dot_

 mccain will hang in like the pit bull he is _meta_end_dot_

 giuliani will have misplayed his cards and gambled too big _meta_end_dot_

 and ron paul will be recommitted to the institution he broke out of to campaign for president oh yeah that would be the house of representatives _meta_end_dot_

 thompson has a chance _meta_end_dot_
