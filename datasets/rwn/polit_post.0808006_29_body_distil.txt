  there have been people predicting that the jeremiah wright scandal would destroy obama s campaign _meta_end_dot_

 although that may turn out to be true it still seems like a bit too much of a presumption to make _meta_end_dot_

 instead i would compare this to hillary s horrible flub of a driver s licenses for illegals question at a debate _meta_end_dot_

 it was a big mistake that her enemies jumped on and her poor handling of the issue in the weeks that followed weakened her significantly and punctured the sense of inevitability that surrounded her campaign _meta_end_dot_

 this is a similar situation _meta_end_dot_

 obama s numbers are dipping hard and it s starting to become possible to imagine that the bleeding will get so bad that the democratic super delegates may break hard towards hillary to prevent a general election disaster _meta_end_dot_

 take a look at the latest numbers and you ll see what i mean _meta_end_dot_

 first off from campaign spot i began the day noting that obama s lead in north carolina was shrinking _meta_end_dot_

 this poll from public policy polling out this afternoon suggests that it may be gone entirely putting obama up over hillary by a single point _meta_number_ref_ percent to _meta_number_ref_ percent _meta_end_dot_

 caveat ppp had the poll closer than most other pollsters last month putting obama up by _meta_number_ref_ percent does that mean obama will now lose north carolina _meta_end_question_

 no it doesn t _meta_end_dot_

 moreover the poll could just be an outlier _meta_end_dot_

 however it s worth noting that the feb polls of nc had obama up _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ points so the gap is definitely starting to close _meta_end_dot_

 now let s take a look at some data in _meta_number_ref_ other states from surveyusa in kentucky our polling at the beginning of the month showed mccain leading clinton by _meta_number_ref_ and obama by _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 n kentucky john mccain is _meta_number_ref_ points ahead of hillary clinton and _meta_number_ref_ points ahead of barack obama two and a half weeks ago john mccain led hillary clinton by _meta_number_ref_ points and barack obama by _meta_number_ref_ in missouri _meta_end_dot_

 now clinton has risen slightly to cut mccain s lead to _meta_number_ref_ and obama has fallen and now trails mccain by _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 surveyusa s _meta_number_ref_ state head to head polling late last month showed hillary clinton and barack obama each ten points ahead of john mccain in ohio _meta_end_dot_

 in updated polling conducted this past weekend before obama s tuesday speech on race mccain narrowed the gap by _meta_number_ref_ points against hillary clinton who now leads him by six and flipped the table on barack obama who now trails mccain by _meta_number_ref_ points _meta_end_dot_

 now from the philly daily news the latest daily news franklin marshall poll shows u s _meta_end_dot_

 sen _meta_end_dot_

 hillary clinton expanding her lead to _meta_number_ref_ points over u s _meta_end_dot_

 sen _meta_end_dot_

 barack obama in the democratic presidential primary in pennsylvania _meta_end_dot_

 the survey of registered democrats found clinton leading obama _meta_number_ref_ to _meta_number_ref_ percent among likely voters with an even larger lead of _meta_number_ref_ to _meta_number_ref_ percent among all voters _meta_end_dot_

 clinton s strength in the latest poll reversed gains obama made in the february survey which showed him pulling to within _meta_number_ref_ points as his campaign surged nationally _meta_end_dot_

 what s happening here _meta_end_question_

 i d say that it looks like wright is turning off white voters who had been favorably disposed towards obama _meta_end_dot_

 moreover the fact that obama chose to continue to embrace wright in his big speech will likely mean that this is a long term problem that will get worse as opposed to a short term blip _meta_end_dot_
