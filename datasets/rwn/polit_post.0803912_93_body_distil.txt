  don t let the perfect be the enemy of the good voltaire i keep hearing conservatives say that if john mccain is the nominee and barring a miracle he will be at this point that they re going to sit out the election or even vote for the democratic nominee because of conservative principles as one conservative and not as a john mccain conservative but as a i supported duncan hunter and fred thompson oppose amnesty and abortion fought to get samuel alito instead of harriet miers believe in small government term limits tax cuts and balancing the budget conservative to another let me tell you that i very respectfully but also very strongly disagree with that definition of conservative principles there is nothing conservative about working with the democratic nominee against most of your fellow conservatives in order to grow government socialize medicine lose the war in iraq tilt the supreme court to the left and make roe v _meta_end_dot_

 wade the permanent law of the land _meta_end_dot_

 if you are conservative and vote for the democratic nominee or even just refuse to vote for mccain who is by any and every objective standard considerably more conservative than either of them let me tell you what you are not doing you are not doing the logical thing _meta_end_dot_

 when faced with a choice between a moderate who holds some conservative positions and some non conservative positions and a liberal who holds no conservative positions the logical decision is to take the moderate _meta_end_dot_

 after all half a loaf is better than none _meta_end_dot_

 you are not helping conservatism or your fellow conservatives _meta_end_dot_

 to the contrary you are helping liberals defeat conservative ideas _meta_end_dot_

 isn t that what conservatives are saying that they re furious at mccain over _meta_end_question_

 well who s less of a conservative john mccain who if he were in the white house would help conservatives win some battles and would help liberals win others or the conservatives who want to help a democrat get into the office who will go against conservative ideas every time _meta_end_question_

 you are not looking out for the best interests of the country _meta_end_dot_

 if you believe winning in iraq is better than losing if you believe balancing the budget is better than higher deficit spending if you believe that having a supreme court that is tilted to the right is better than having a supreme court tilted to the left and if you believe that roe v _meta_end_dot_

 wade is leading to the immoral murder of millions of children and the overwhelming majority of people reading this column certainly believe all those things then you are certainly not putting the good of the country first if you oppose john mccain in november _meta_end_dot_

 some might argue that having hillary clinton in office would be better for the country and conservatism because she would screw things up so badly that it would actually help conservatives in the long run _meta_end_dot_

 but if people haven t seen through hillary clinton after _meta_number_ref_ years in the public eye what makes you think another _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ years in the white house would do it _meta_end_question_

 how many americans saw through fdr _meta_end_question_

 even as his government policies extended the depression for years after it should have ended he was voted back into office _meta_end_dot_

 yes he was a capable war president but he also did more damage to this country domestically than any other president in history short term and long term and he s still considered by many people to be one of our greatest presidents _meta_end_dot_

 but we don t have to go all the way back to roosevelt just think back to _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 what did we hear then _meta_end_question_

 we should stay home and teach the republicans a lesson _meta_end_dot_

 they ll take a big beating and it ll be great for conservatism how did that turn out _meta_end_question_

 from where i am sitting we have a lot less republicans in congress more squabbling than ever and we re going to have republican nominee john mccain _meta_end_dot_

 why _meta_end_question_

 because sometimes a loss leads to better things but in politics as often as not losing just begets more losing and it can sometimes take a very very long time for movements to learn from its mistakes _meta_end_dot_

 think back to roosevelt whose victories started a _meta_number_ref_ year long dominant cycle for the democrats and that party s shift to the left in _meta_number_ref_ that started a long slow slide for them that may have finally ended in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 along those same lines it s also worth noting that after barry goldwater was destroyed in _meta_number_ref_ richard nixon who was even less conservative than mccain was elected to two terms in the white house _meta_end_dot_

 then in _meta_number_ref_ reagan became president _meta_end_dot_

 so there is absolutely no reason to think that if a moderate republican gets into the white house that it will prevent a conservative republican from getting in later and since i mentioned reagan i have heard his name invoked many times in the past few weeks to justify not supporting mccain in the general election _meta_end_dot_

 if ronald reagan had been alive and had chosen to endorse a candidate in the primaries even mccain fans should be honest enough to admit that candidate probably wouldn t have been john mccain _meta_end_dot_

 but mccain s most ardent opponents should also be honest enough to note that ronald reagan campaigned for richard nixon and gerald ford both of whom were to the left of john mccain _meta_end_dot_

 so were he still alive ronald reagan would almost certainly campaign for mccain against hillary or barack and you can be sure that he would not approve of conservatives who say that they d rather have a liberal democrat in the white house than a far from perfect republican _meta_end_dot_

 so whether the question is what would reagan do or what would a principled conservative do in november the answer would be the same vote for john mccain _meta_end_dot_
