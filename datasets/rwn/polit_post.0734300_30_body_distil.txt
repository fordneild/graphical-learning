  so now christmas trees are just _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 holiday trees _meta_end_dot_

 what is the point of a holiday tree again other than to decorate the living room for a few weeks _meta_end_question_

 and why exactly do we bother to hang sock laundry by the fireplace _meta_end_question_

 sometimes i can feel the heart and soul of christmas slipping away _meta_end_dot_

 i felt it as i wrote my generic holiday cards this week hesitating to so much as include a picture of santa on some cards for fear of offending a friend of unknown religious faith _meta_end_dot_

 the chill of meaninglessness gripped me again this week as i read a note from my son s school telling me that a winter music recital will precede the winter break _meta_end_dot_

 it s not christmas anymore _meta_end_dot_

 it s just winter now _meta_end_dot_

 how cold _meta_end_dot_

 how empty _meta_end_dot_

 the heart and soul of christmas is fading into the whitewash of political correctness _meta_end_dot_

 we might as well just flip the calendar from november to january and be done with it _meta_end_dot_

 there are some enemies of christmas who would like nothing more _meta_end_dot_

 friends don t let christmas fade so rapidly into that good night _meta_end_dot_

 realize that approximately _meta_percent_ref_ of americans are christians _meta_end_dot_

 do you realize that _meta_end_question_

 our schools colleges and mass media are so thoroughly purged of any mention of god that it s easy to forget who we are most of us _meta_end_dot_

 only about _meta_percent_ref_ of us are jewish and another _meta_percent_ref_ are muslim _meta_end_dot_

 add a few agnostics atheists and persons of other religious faiths and you ve got yourself a nation _meta_end_dot_

 that vast majority of americans are christians _meta_end_dot_

 you wouldn t know if from our public celebrations these days _meta_end_dot_

 the dreidel song and hanukkah seem to take equal billing with christmas songs in many venues including my children s schools _meta_end_dot_

 no it s worse than that _meta_end_dot_

 the dreidel and hanukkah compete with frosty the snowman _meta_end_dot_

 jesus is nowhere to be seen or heard _meta_end_dot_

 honestly if you were to give it proportionate attention references to hanukkah in december should come up about _meta_number_ref_ time for every _meta_number_ref_ references to christmas _meta_end_dot_

 but it s equal billing for both holidays in many places or worse yet the soul numbing whitewash of happy holidays with an icy bow to winter _meta_end_dot_

 all americans should worship freely as long as they worship side by side in peace i know good and peaceful jews and muslims who share this american life with us _meta_end_dot_

 bless them _meta_end_exclamation_

 but speaking to the _meta_percent_ref_ or so of my fellow americans who share my faith let us not forget our christian heritage _meta_end_exclamation_

 christianity is a huge part of what made this nation great _meta_end_dot_

 it is christianity more than most other religions on earth that recognizes the importance of separation between church and state _meta_end_dot_

 jesus recognized a separation between the things of god and the things of caesar _meta_end_dot_

 christianity in america today is also a shining beacon of religious tolerance particularly as compared to any islamic nation on earth _meta_end_dot_

 yet we have walked willingly so far in the direction of political correctness that we are in danger of losing our own hearts and souls _meta_end_dot_

 finding nothing but winter in too much of the public square i turn away from the world and seek out the tiny christian music station on my radio to hear every christmas song i love _meta_end_dot_

 i turn to my church and happily sing gloria in excelsis deo _meta_end_exclamation_

 if i drive by our church there s a nativity scene out front _meta_end_dot_

 there s one at the local el pollo loco too surprisingly _meta_end_dot_

 but someone has placed a lamb in the manger _meta_end_dot_

 baby jesus is awol _meta_end_dot_

 i will not forget christmas _meta_end_dot_

 but when you and i are long gone will christmas live on in america _meta_end_question_

 please say that it will _meta_end_dot_

 please teach your children well _meta_end_dot_

 merry christmas my friends _meta_end_dot_
