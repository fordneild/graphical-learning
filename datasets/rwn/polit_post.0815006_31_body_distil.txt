  if you want a friend in washington get a dog harry truman the hot story of the day yesterday was scott mcclellan s new tell all book that trashes the bush administration _meta_end_dot_

 unfortunately mediocrities like mcclellan often write these sort of books although most of the time they at least have enough class to wait until the president is out of office _meta_end_dot_

 in mcclellan s case we re talking about a guy who wasn t considered to be very good at his job _meta_end_dot_

 that s why he was forced out and replaced with tony snow a guy whose jock strap he probably couldn t carry with a wheelbarrow and now mcclellan s settling a few scores and making a bundle at the same time with this book _meta_end_dot_

 today he s at the top of drudge conservatives are bashing him and liberals are singing his praises _meta_end_dot_

 he ll be all over tv and the libs in the media will spend a couple of weeks breathlessly pushing his stories _meta_end_dot_

 then once he happily prances out in front of congress and speculates about what karl rove and scooter libby may have been talking about in a meeting he wasn t present at or gives his opinion on what condi rice may have been thinking at some point or another he ll get a new round of publicity for his tome _meta_end_dot_

 that ll certainly sell some books allow mcclellan to try to point the finger elsewhere for his poor job performance and perhaps most importantly it ll allow him to settle a few scores _meta_end_dot_

 bush gave him the heave ho _meta_end_question_

 well he ll pay him back _meta_end_exclamation_

 condi rice drank the coke with his name on it in the fridge _meta_end_question_

 well she ll get hers _meta_end_dot_

 karl rove forgot to give scott a christmas gift _meta_end_question_

 oh yeah rove is going to get a little payback in the book _meta_end_exclamation_

 could it really be that petty _meta_end_question_

 maybe maybe not but either way there doesn t seem to be much substance behind many of the most highly publicized allegations and there sure are a lot of former white house employees pointing out that what mcclellan is saying in this book doesn t match up with what he was saying privately when he was in the white house _meta_end_dot_
