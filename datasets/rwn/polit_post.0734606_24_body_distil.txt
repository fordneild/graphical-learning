  matt sanchez guest posts at right wing news and has been embedded in afghanistan and iraq _meta_end_dot_

 this interview with him was done via email _meta_end_dot_

 a fter winning the jeane kirkpatrick academic freedom award at cpac you had liberal blogs reveal that you did gay porn and they claimed gay prostitution _meta_end_dot_

 you have admitted that you ve done gay porn _meta_end_dot_

 what about gay prostitution _meta_end_question_

 first off _meta_end_dot_

 i never participated in gay prostitution _meta_end_dot_

 i never participated in prostitution of any sort but i will confess that i did feel like a disgruntled john after voting for hillary clinton in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 first of all how do you feel about your former lifestyle _meta_end_question_

 in those days i was very much a rebellious libertarian _meta_end_dot_

 porn was a no brainer way of sticking the middle finger at what i knew to be a hypocritical society _meta_end_dot_

 porn was legal it was marginal edgy and i figured it would anger all the right people _meta_end_dot_

 several years later i ve been proven correct _meta_end_dot_

 once your past came out what kind of reaction did you receive from conservatives _meta_end_question_

 conservatives have a strong libertarian branch and recognize the intrinsic value of a human being beyond image _meta_end_dot_

 this is why conservatives will always choose substance over silliness _meta_end_dot_

 ronald reagan over ron paul _meta_end_dot_

 in my case conservatives eventually extended a hand michelle malkin ann coulter neil cavuto kevin mccullough lisa dipasquale and even joseph farah over at worldnetdaily _meta_end_dot_

 was that what you expected _meta_end_question_

 honestly i didn t know what to expect but what i got was more support and interest than i ever deserved _meta_end_dot_

 now i m concerned how conservatives will treat me after revealing that i voted for hillary in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 that s actually more embarrassing than films like tijuana toilet tramps _meta_end_dot_

 now since then you ve been embedded in iraq and afghanistan _meta_end_dot_

 first off tell us a little bit about your time in iraq and how you think things are going there _meta_end_dot_

 in iraq the media tried pulling off a coup attempt by cooking the coverage _meta_end_dot_

 i understand performance is an element of the news but these people were just flat out hamming it up for the cameras _meta_end_dot_

 iraq is a country the size of california with a population as large as canada s _meta_end_dot_

 on any given day things happen very ugly things happen _meta_end_dot_

 iraq was under a coordinated assault by islamofascists who terrorized the country after the fall of saddam _meta_end_dot_

 what the media showed was a one sided military drama about how directionless the conflict was while completely downplaying the actions and motives of the enemy _meta_end_dot_

 fast forward a couple of years and the coverage has changed because of great independent reporting _meta_end_dot_

 iraq had an average of only _meta_number_ref_ western reporters from _meta_number_ref_ through _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 the country is the size of california but even less media interest than brian depalma s hit redacted _meta_end_dot_

 when people like michael yon michael totten bill roggio jd johannes michelle malkin and laura ingraham sean hannity et al showed a more in depth view it challenged the media monopoly _meta_end_dot_

 the internet and talk radio played a huge role in this _meta_end_dot_

 thanks to eyes on the ground reporting spin like thomas scott beauchamp was challenged and debunked _meta_end_dot_

 that entire liberal soap opera would have stood unchallenged a bit like how the mccarthyism myth has largely stood unchallenged _meta_end_dot_

 ok now tell us about your time in afghanistan and how you think things are going there _meta_end_dot_

 the media is trying using the same playbook in afghanistan _meta_end_dot_

 i just got back from covering an air assault in the musa qala district in southern afghanistan a former taliban stronghold _meta_end_dot_

 this is a hotspot in british battle space that the brits ceded to the taliban because they apparently wanted to avoid casualties _meta_end_dot_

 the taliban fortified their positions and carried out several successful attacks on british and american forces _meta_end_dot_

 the situation finally became intolerable and coalition forces just went in on a cordon and sweep operation _meta_end_dot_

 afghanistan will eventually be fine but the world needs to understand that a small backwards country if left unchecked can not only flood the free world with heroin but can also be a breeding ground for international terrorism _meta_end_dot_

 that s why the economy is so important _meta_end_dot_

 the only difference between tora bora and hollywood is that tinseltown earns money for the fairy tales they make up _meta_end_dot_

 the taliban tells tall tales and gets fanatics as followers and push drug consumption _meta_end_dot_

 on second thought there are lots of similarities except liberals would probably force men to wear the burkas _meta_end_dot_

 the marine corps has reportedly been investigating you _meta_end_dot_

 has that investigation been completed and if so what were the results of it _meta_end_question_

 the corps principally investigated an allegation that i had solicited funds from u haul for a future deployment this was a ridiculous joke allegation against me by a veterans group in new york that eventually came under financial scrutiny itself and reportedly no longer exists _meta_end_dot_

 the marine colonel charles jones eventually called the allegations a misunderstanding _meta_end_dot_

 my lawyer likes to call that misunderstanding grounds for a lawsuit _meta_end_dot_

 investigation is over marines are known for efficiency _meta_end_dot_

 i m going to cut and paste the results major amy n _meta_end_dot_

 thomas usmc thomas maj amy to me sep _meta_number_ref_ cpl sanchez to date there is no pending marine corps action punitive or otherwise _meta_end_dot_

 col charles a jones investigation states i conclude that the questions over deployment and fund solicitation were misunderstandings not misrepresentations _meta_end_dot_

 all parties were acting in good faith therefore as to this topic there really isn t anything further to discuss _meta_end_dot_

 that was that like the avian bird flu or a film starring brad pitt a lot of threats and flashy ads but a total flop _meta_end_dot_

 incidentally do you agree with the don t ask don t tell policy or do you believe gays should be able to serve openly in the military _meta_end_question_

 general order _meta_number_ref_ prohibits sex and pornography in a combat zone for multiple deployments of up to _meta_number_ref_ months _meta_end_dot_

 fortunately the military frowns on that whole lisping and snapping thing no one shines boots anymore and the term drilling means something entirely different in the marine corps _meta_end_dot_

 i m not sure how many homosexuals are willing to sacrifice sex and an entire season of ugly betty but it doesn t look good every gay activist has waived a white flag on the don t ask don t tell quagmire _meta_end_dot_

 personally i d settle for gays serving if congressman john murtha would stop outing himself as a marine _meta_end_dot_
