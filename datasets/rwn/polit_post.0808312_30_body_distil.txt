  i m talking about his gig as the goracle _meta_end_dot_

 is it over _meta_end_question_

 last monday on abc radio national of all places there was a tipping point of a different kind in the debate on climate change _meta_end_dot_

 it was a remarkable interview involving the co host of counterpoint michael duffy and jennifer marohasy a biologist and senior fellow of melbourne based think tank the institute of public affairs _meta_end_dot_

 anyone in public life who takes a position on the greenhouse gas hypothesis will ignore it at their peril _meta_end_dot_

 duffy asked marohasy is the earth stillwarming she replied no actually there has been cooling if you take _meta_number_ref_ as your point of reference _meta_end_dot_

 if you take _meta_number_ref_ as your point of reference then temperatures have plateaued _meta_end_dot_

 this is certainly not what you d expect if carbon dioxide is driving temperature because carbon dioxide levels have been increasing but temperatures have actually been coming down over the last _meta_number_ref_ years so depending on your reference point _meta_number_ref_ years ago or _meta_number_ref_ years ago you have either cooling or no change _meta_end_dot_

 next question duffy is this a matter of any controversy marohasy actually no _meta_end_dot_

 the head of the ipcc intergovernmental panel on climate change has actually acknowledged it _meta_end_dot_

 he talks about the apparent plateau in temperatures so far this century _meta_end_dot_

 so he recognises that in this century over the past eight years temperatures have plateaued _meta_end_dot_

 this is not what you d expect as i said because if carbon dioxide is driving temperature then you d expect that given carbon dioxide levels have been continuing to increase temperatures should be going up _meta_end_dot_

 so it s very unexpected not something that s being discussed _meta_end_dot_

 it should be being discussed though because it s very significant well actually i disagree _meta_end_dot_

 it is being discussed _meta_end_dot_

 but it is also being pretty roundly ignored _meta_end_dot_

 vested interest and all _meta_end_dot_

 duffy then turned to the question of how the proponents of the greenhouse gas hypothesis deal with data that doesn t support their case _meta_end_dot_

 people like kevin rudd and ross garnaut are speaking as though the earth is still warming at an alarming rate but what is the argument from the other side _meta_end_question_

 what would people associated with the ipcc say to explain the temperature dip marohasy well the head of the ipcc has suggested natural factors are compensating for the increasing carbon dioxide levels and i guess to some extent that s what sceptics have been saying for some time that yes carbon dioxide will give you some warming but there are a whole lot of other factors that may compensate or that may augment the warming from elevated levels of carbon dioxide _meta_end_dot_

 there s been a lot of talk about the impact of the sun and that maybe we re going to go through or are entering a period of less intense solar activity and this could be contributing to the current cooling for the most part those of us who ve continued to point out that the big old firey hot yellow thing that hangs in the sky everyday might have a whole bunch to do with whatever climate change happens here were mostly derided as know nothing kooks _meta_end_dot_

 it has to be that infinitesimal by comparison bit of co_meta_number_ref_ we contribute of course _meta_end_dot_

 duffy can you tell us about nasa s aqua satellite because i understand some of the data we re now getting is quite important in our understanding of how climate works marohasy that s right _meta_end_dot_

 the satellite was only launched in _meta_number_ref_ and it enabled the collection of data not just on temperature but also on cloud formation and water vapour _meta_end_dot_

 what all the climate models suggest is that when you ve got warming from additional carbon dioxide this will result in increased water vapour so you re going to get a positive feedback _meta_end_dot_

 that s what the models have been indicating _meta_end_dot_

 what this great data from the nasa aqua satellite _meta_end_dot_

 is actually showing is just the opposite that with a little bit of warming weather processes are compensating so they re actually limiting the greenhouse effect and you re getting a negative rather than a positive feedback and yet when the skeptics pointed out the dearth of knowledge about cloud formation and albedo and that clouds were badly modeled or not modeled at all we were again told we simply didn t have a clue _meta_end_dot_

 duffy the climate is actually in one way anyway more robust than was assumed in the climate models marohasy that s right _meta_end_dot_

 these findings actually aren t being disputed by the meteorological community _meta_end_dot_

 they re having trouble digesting the findings they re acknowledging the findings they re acknowledging that the data from nasa s aqua satellite is not how the models predict and i think they re about to recognise that the models really do need to be overhauled and that when they are overhauled they will probably show greatly reduced future warming projected as a consequence of carbon dioxide you mean that reductions in that convenient single source blame all gas that could be attributed to increased human activity probably isn t the way to defeat global warming _meta_end_question_

 wow _meta_end_dot_

 there go a whole boat load of green jobs in politics on such things as global warming commissions _meta_end_dot_

 and the cap and trade programs oh the humanity _meta_end_dot_

 not to mention those _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ climate change messengers al gore has out there spreading the word _meta_end_question_

 will it be the unemployment line for them as well _meta_end_question_

 this could be catastrophic _meta_end_exclamation_

 duffy from what you re saying it sounds like the implications of this could be considerable marohasy that s right very much so _meta_end_dot_

 the policy implications are enormous _meta_end_dot_

 the meteorological community at the moment is really just coming to terms with the output from this nasa aqua satellite and climate scientist roy spencer s interpretation of them _meta_end_dot_

 his work is published his work is accepted but i think people are still in shock at this point well we ll see how shocked they really are when we see them actually admit that not only isn t the science settled it may be all wrong _meta_end_dot_

 in the meantime the policy implications of co_meta_number_ref_ caused agw continue to be planned for and as with all such things political it s like trying to turn a battleship around going full speed it takes a very long time to slow it down enough to do that _meta_end_dot_

 my concern if all of the above is accurate and as i read more and more there seems to be a good number of scientists recognizing the current agw data is bad and the models are deficient in may important ways the policy implications are enormous _meta_end_dot_

 whether you are convinced or not about what marohasy is saying it is more than enough to give pause and by that i mean pause in both an intellectual and policy execution way _meta_end_dot_

 it is far to early given the new data that seems to be coming available for anyone to claim that we must save the earth by reducing carbon dioxide out put through severe cut backs far too early _meta_end_dot_

 pity al gore was just cashing in too _meta_end_dot_
