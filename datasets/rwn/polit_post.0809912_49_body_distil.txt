  muslims are still threatening violence some of it overtly and some of it in a more subtle fashion over geert wilders short film fitna which shows muslim violence in the name of islam and the aftermath an online documentary film critical of islam continued to shake the muslim world over the weekend sparking street protests attempted censorship and calls for retaliatory boycotts _meta_end_dot_

 as tens of thousands of chanting pakistanis gathered in karachi sunday to protest dutch lawmaker geert wilders film linking the koran with terrorism and extremism the speaker of iran s conservative dominated parliament urged muslims to sever economic ties with countries that blaspheme islam saying western nations would quickly repent once they saw their economies endangered _meta_end_dot_

 and in saudi arabia the head of a bloc of _meta_number_ref_ islamic states stepped up calls for governments to enact and enforce laws criminalizing the abuse of free speech to attack religions _meta_end_dot_

 speaking in jeddah organization of the islamic conference oic secretary general ekmeleddin ihsanoglu said it was high time that the international community agreed that actions like wilders film and the publication of newspaper cartoons lampooning islam s prophet posed a grave threat to global peace and security _meta_end_dot_

 unless the perpetrators of such acts of intolerance and racism were made to face justice under national or international laws they would be free to defy the will of the international community and undo progress in improving relations between religions he said in a statement _meta_end_dot_

 you ve got to love the mafia style declaration from the oic _meta_end_dot_

 after all who do you suppose will be creating that grave threat to global peace and security if muslims are offended _meta_end_question_

 could it be hindus _meta_end_question_

 maybe the buddhists _meta_end_question_

 oh oh i ve got it it must be the catholics _meta_end_dot_

 riiiighhht _meta_end_dot_

 that being said i ve got to give these guys credit for one thing they understand how to play left wingers particularly western european left wingers like fiddles _meta_end_dot_

 there s the threat of violence which terrifies the lefties mixed in with a call for international action dialogue and a claim that the people making the threats are really the victims _meta_end_dot_

 meanwhile muslims many of whom will ultimately act as parts of a _meta_number_ref_th column against the nations that take them in are being allowed to pour into these countries because the lefties are futilely trying to prop up an unsustainable social welfare system on the backs of immigrants _meta_end_dot_

 it s hard to know exactly how this is going to turn out in another decade or two but the situation certainly has the potential to be much bleaker than it is today unless the west remembers where it left its spine _meta_end_dot_
