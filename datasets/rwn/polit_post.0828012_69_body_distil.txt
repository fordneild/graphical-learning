  folks i d like to take a moment to encourage you to chip in a few bucks to tom mcclintock _meta_end_dot_

 he s the only candidate endorsed both by tom tancredo s team america pac and the club for growth so as you d imagine this is a guy you can trust on illegal immigration and on issues of fiscal conservatism _meta_end_dot_

 plus the district the guy is in _meta_end_question_

 it s a r _meta_number_ref_ district _meta_end_dot_

 that means if mcclintock gets in the democrats will never move him out of there and we ll have a guy up there we can count on for years to come _meta_end_dot_

 in fact the only reason this district is competitive is because the guy who s holding it now john doolittle is sleazy and mcclintock s opponent charlie brown built up a reputation and the donors for a war chest by running close against doolittle the last time _meta_end_dot_

 so if you re looking to really make a donation count let me strongly suggest that you put some money towards tom mcclintock s campaign _meta_end_dot_

 this is a guy who deserves your support _meta_end_dot_
