  people who are honest will admit that race is a double edged sword for barack obama _meta_end_dot_

 yes there are certainly racist democrats and independents out there who will not vote for barack obama because he s black _meta_end_dot_

 on the other hand if barack obama weren t black he could have never gotten this far _meta_end_dot_

 a white man with his experience and abilities wouldn t have even been considered qualified to run for the presidency much less actually become the party s nominee _meta_end_dot_

 moreover obama may have been talking about change and hope but in reality race has always been at the center of his campaign although admittedly in a different way than it would be in the case of a sharpton or jackson _meta_end_dot_

 at the heart of obama s appeal is a faustian bargain that has been subtly offered by his candidacy put obama into the white house even though he s not qualified to be president and we can have a post racial era _meta_end_dot_

 america can never be called racist again you yes you personally can never be called racist again but if he doesn t win well it just confirms that america is still a racist country like in the sixties and that you personally if you didn t vote for him are a racist as we get closer to the election expect the left to become much more explicit about the deal _meta_end_dot_

 take a look at these excerpts from the latest column from slate s jacob weisberg and you will see what i mean yet barack obama with every natural and structural advantage in the presidential race is running only neck and neck against john mccain a sub par republican nominee with a list of liabilities longer than a joe biden monologue _meta_end_dot_

 obama has built a crack political operation raised record sums and inspired millions with his eloquence and vision _meta_end_dot_

 mccain has struggled with a fractious campaign team lacks clarity and discipline and remains a stranger to charisma _meta_end_dot_

 yet at the moment the two of them appear to be tied _meta_end_dot_

 what gives _meta_end_question_

 if it makes you feel better you can rationalize obama s missing _meta_number_ref_ point lead on the basis of clintonite sulkiness his slowness in responding to attacks or the concern that obama may be too handsome brilliant and cool to be elected _meta_end_dot_

 but let s be honest if you break the numbers down the reason obama isn t ahead right now is that he trails badly among one group older white voters _meta_end_dot_

 he does so for a simple reason the color of his skin _meta_end_dot_

 many have discoursed on what an obama victory could mean for america _meta_end_dot_

 we would finally be able to see our legacy of slavery segregation and racism in the rearview mirror _meta_end_dot_

 our kids would grow up thinking of prejudice as a nonfactor in their lives _meta_end_dot_

 the rest of the world would embrace a less fearful and more open post post _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ america _meta_end_dot_

 but does it not follow that an obama defeat would signify the opposite _meta_end_question_

 if obama loses our children will grow up thinking of equal opportunity as a myth _meta_end_dot_

 his defeat would say that when handed a perfect opportunity to put the worst part of our history behind us we chose not to _meta_end_dot_

 in this event the world s judgment will be severe and inescapable the united states had its day but in the end couldn t put its own self interest ahead of its crazy irrationality over race _meta_end_dot_

 and there you go whether america is a racist nation or not depends entirely on whether we put an unqualified mediocrity into the white house just because he s black _meta_end_dot_

 of course when it comes to faustian bargains the devil always finds a way to welch on the deal _meta_end_dot_

 in this case the very fact that obama has captured the democratic party s nomination has won almost entirely white states and is a serious contender for the presidency should prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that america isn t a racist nation _meta_end_dot_

 moreover obama ain t no jackie robinson folks _meta_end_dot_

 he hasn t got the talent to compete in the big leagues and will the left really be content to allow the first black president to be seen as a hopeless miserable failure who wasn t up to the job _meta_end_question_

 no they won t _meta_end_dot_

 so if obama gets in you can expect his supporters to constantly play the race card to make up for his many failings _meta_end_dot_

 why is obama s approval rating so low _meta_end_question_

 racism _meta_end_exclamation_

 why is the media paying so much attention to his mistakes _meta_end_question_

 racism _meta_end_exclamation_

 why don t more americans support obama s policies _meta_end_question_

 racism _meta_end_exclamation_

 that along with an enormous lurch to the far left for the country will be what the next four years will be like if obama gets into the white house _meta_end_dot_
