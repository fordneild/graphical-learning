  the media s attempt to install an unqualified ultra left radical in the white house has entered the twilight zone with the alarmingly powerful ap s attempt to smear as racist anyone who objects to obama s close association with anti american terrorists _meta_end_dot_

 obama is a prot g of unrepentant weather underground terrorist bill ayers who introduced him to the chicago political scene at his apartment back in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 highlights of ayers s resume include bombing the pentagon the capitol and new york city police headquarters getting away with it because of prosecutorial misconduct then bragging in the september _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ edition of the new york times that he wished he had done more _meta_end_dot_

 also in attendance at obama s coming out party was ayers s wife bernardine dohrn another unrepentant terrorist who invented the weather underground s three fingered fork salute in honor of the fork the manson family stuck in sharon tate s pregnant belly _meta_end_dot_

 obama has worked closely with ayers on the woods fund and the annenberg challenge _meta_end_dot_

 when their friendship actually began is unknown but dohrn knew obama s noisily anti american wife at least since _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 no reasonable person aware of this information would want barack obama to have access to america s nuclear codes which is why ap has declared discussion of the topic to be racist _meta_end_dot_

 here s how it tried to slap down sarah palin for bringing it up by claiming that democrat barack obama is palling around with terrorists and doesn t see the u s _meta_end_dot_

 like other americans vice presidential candidate sarah palin targeted key goals for a faltering campaign _meta_end_dot_

 and though she may have scored a political hit each time her attack was unsubstantiated and carried a racially tinged subtext that john mccain himself may come to regret _meta_end_dot_

 palin s words avoid repulsing voters with overt racism _meta_end_dot_

 but is there another subtext for creating the false sic image of a black presidential nominee palling around with terrorists while assuring a predominantly white audience that he doesn t see their america _meta_end_question_

 it doesn t matter that obama s terrorist mentors ayers and dohrn are caucasians _meta_end_dot_

 all resistance to the obamessiah is racist _meta_end_dot_

 ap says it s racist to acknowledge their relationship with obama _meta_end_dot_
