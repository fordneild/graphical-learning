  the ap wants to make damned sure you get their point t alk turns to the state of the union and the optimists become decidedly bleak _meta_end_dot_

 they use words such as terrified disgusted and scary to describe what one calls this mess we americans find ourselves in _meta_end_dot_

 then comes the list of problems constituting the mess a protracted war _meta_dollor_ref_ a gallon gas soaring food prices uncertainty about jobs an erratic stock market a tougher housing market and so on and so forth _meta_end_dot_

 one member s son is serving his second tour in iraq _meta_end_dot_

 another speaks of a daughter who s lost her job in the mortgage industry and a son in construction whose salary was slashed _meta_end_dot_

 still another mentions a friend who can barely afford gas _meta_end_dot_

 joanne kontak _meta_number_ref_ an elementary school lunch aide inducted just this day as an optimist sums things up like this there s just entirely too much wrong right now happy birthday america _meta_end_question_

 this year we re not so sure _meta_end_dot_

 what a repeat of the smear job of just a couple of weeks ago _meta_end_exclamation_

 alternatively the ap is right _meta_end_dot_

 the four or five people they quote really are representative of america of what writer pauline arrilaga calls we kimosabe _meta_end_dot_

 after all there are those wrong direction polls _meta_end_exclamation_

 perhaps this news item really is newsworthy _meta_end_dot_

 in which case here s the news what a bunch of miserable whining ingrates america has become _meta_end_exclamation_

 and how lucky america is that there are millions in other countries willing literally to risk death to beg sneak or sue their way in here take their places and breath the fresh air of liberty and opportunity _meta_end_dot_

 it s odd that of all people pauline arrilaga missed that angle considering that she writes frequently about illegal immigrants crossing the border and about the brutality of smuggling rings that exploit them what makes these people submit to such brutality _meta_end_dot_

 just to go in the wrong direction _meta_end_question_

 considering that one such story she wrote was described by the ap itself same link as based on meticulous reporting _meta_end_dot_

 why didn t she ask these immigrants that question _meta_end_question_

 but she could be right _meta_end_dot_

 i d rather assume the far more intuitively obvious and historically supportable proposition what a nasty self hating outfit the associated press is _meta_end_dot_

 cross posted on likelihood of success _meta_end_dot_
