  the cpac pics didn t work out as well as i had hoped because i used a camcorder instead of a camera for pics _meta_end_dot_

 no lights a dim basement that we were in s low quality pics at times _meta_end_dot_

 i also completely lost a pic of me and mark steyn which really sucks _meta_end_dot_

 the next time i do an event like this i will buy and carry a top notch camera with me to make sure that doesn t happen again _meta_end_dot_

 additionally i had my pics scattered across a wide range of tapes and once it was over i realized that i missed getting pics of several people _meta_end_dot_

 oh well best laid plans of mice and men and all that _meta_end_dot_

 now let s hit them a pic at a time _meta_end_dot_

 flip romney the dolphin was at the convention on thursday _meta_end_dot_
