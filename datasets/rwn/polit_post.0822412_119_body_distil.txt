  update and once again mcq beats me to the punch _meta_end_dot_

 eh well this is an important story and my take is a bit different _meta_end_dot_

 for what it s worth i m not quite sure that russia plans to stop and let georgia remain sovereign at all _meta_end_dot_

 as of this writing they look to be pushing into central georgia _meta_end_dot_

 in some respects the point is moot _meta_end_dot_

 georgia will effectively be helpless before russia and a more willing partner _meta_end_dot_

 it s difficult to be independent with a noose around the neck _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_beep_ref_ russia s ongoing assault on georgia bodes ill for europe and the world _meta_end_dot_

 i do believe that history will show this action to be a seminal moment in the shift in world power _meta_end_dot_

 russia herself is not all that strong but if she controls europe she doesn t have to be strong just strong enough _meta_end_dot_

 mikheil saakashvili writes in the wall street journal today ostensibly this war is about an unresolved separatist conflict _meta_end_dot_

 yet in reality it is a war about the independence and the future of georgia _meta_end_dot_

 and above all it is a war over the kind of europe our children will live in _meta_end_dot_

 let us be frank this conflict is about the future of freedom in europe _meta_end_dot_

 no country of the former soviet union has made more progress toward consolidating democracy eradicating corruption and building an independent foreign policy than georgia _meta_end_dot_

 this is precisely what russia seeks to crush _meta_end_dot_

 the first step in warfare is economic _meta_end_dot_

 with this military action against georgia russia wages economic war on europe _meta_end_dot_

 the analogies to tibet extend only to an imperialistic nation consuming an independent neighbor _meta_end_dot_

 russia s action is entirely different _meta_end_dot_

 putin wants to control the region and europe sits and watches while he is beginning to do just that _meta_end_dot_

 more from tigerhawk about the absent anti war movement _meta_end_dot_

 and this should encourage you guys mccain actually saw this coming _meta_end_dot_

 well so did i but i don t think this makes me a foreign policy genius it might make obama a dummy for not seeing it _meta_end_dot_

 i m being generous here _meta_end_dot_
