  earlier this morning i was talking with my buddy allison sommer from pajamas media about whether stay at home moms were making a wise decision given the situation silda wall spitzer now finds herself in _meta_end_dot_

 here s an edited transcript of our conversation _meta_end_dot_

 allison sommer i hope hillary gets elected president and silda spitzer takes hillary s senate seat _meta_end_dot_

 john hawkins ehr let s not be wishing that fate on the rest of us just to give silda spitzer a break _meta_end_dot_

 allison sommer good feminist lesson you give up your high powered career to raise your kids and support your husband and look where it gets you _meta_end_dot_

 john hawkins nothing wrong with going that route _meta_end_dot_

 her husband was just a sleaze _meta_end_dot_

 allison sommer yes but it illustrates how high risk a career as a spouse is _meta_end_dot_

 john hawkins every career has risks _meta_end_dot_

 there are a lot of rewards to being a stay at home mom as well and most marriages don t end up like the spitzers _meta_end_dot_

 allison sommer didn t say it wasn t rewarding just said it s risky _meta_end_dot_

 john hawkins every profession has risks _meta_end_dot_

 the bottom could fall out of the advertising market next year and i might not be able to support myself blogging _meta_end_dot_

 you could screw up a story and lose your job _meta_end_dot_

 a pro football player could blow out a knee _meta_end_dot_

 a business owner could see a competitor move in across the street and cost him his company _meta_end_dot_

 i don t think stay at home mom is any riskier than anything else and heck who knows the spitzers may end up working this whole thing out or if they don t she may walk away with a severance package far higher than she could have ever gotten from any company _meta_end_dot_

 allison sommer yes but she didn t screw up her job she put her faith in him and he screwed up it s different to have your success ride on your own abilities market forces or even luck rather than someone else s integrity or lack thereof _meta_end_dot_

 john hawkins i don t know _meta_end_dot_

 my last job before i went into blogging was doing tech support _meta_end_dot_

 one day they had a big meeting and told us they were laying us all off but we could take huge cuts in salary and benefits to stay on _meta_end_dot_

 i said no thanks that s a bad break _meta_end_dot_

 she had a bad break too _meta_end_dot_

 i see being a stay at home mom as an honorable profession one that is as good as pretty much any other _meta_end_dot_

 it s not everybody s cup of tea but i think it s a great choice for the women who want and are able to do it _meta_end_dot_

 allison sommer yeah but you can take your skills and experience elsewhere _meta_end_dot_

 it s harder for a _meta_number_ref_ year old woman to do a lot with her resume of bearing someone s kids and running their house and giving dinner parties for their friends _meta_end_dot_

 john hawkins true _meta_end_dot_

 but there s more to life than having a nice resume when you are _meta_number_ref_ years old _meta_end_dot_

 allison sommer i also think it s a totally legit life choice to be respected particularly when the kids are small and school age _meta_end_dot_

 but i see it as a very problematic way to make it a lifetime career profession whatever _meta_end_dot_

 john hawkins depends on your marriage situation _meta_end_dot_

 allison sommer exactly _meta_end_dot_

 which is why girls should not be raised to bank on it as a career choice john hawkins there are probably more women who succeeded in that career choice than any other world wide and in the us over any period in history _meta_end_dot_

 that doesn t mean the other ones are bad or that stay at home mom is the best for everyone but it works out very well for a lot of women _meta_end_dot_

 allison sommer depends on your definition of success _meta_end_dot_

 anyway it s not for me _meta_end_dot_

 been there done that _meta_end_dot_

 the dynamics of my marriage are a lot better when i work _meta_end_dot_

 i ve scaled back my career and i work from home etc _meta_end_dot_

 but i can t imagine life without a career and an income and the knowledge that i am able to support myself and my kids if i had to _meta_end_dot_

 john hawkins well like i said it s not everybody s gig _meta_end_dot_

 if you are happier not being a stay at home mom that s great _meta_end_dot_
