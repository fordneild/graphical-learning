  if obama or hillary is elected and does exactly what he she promises to do deliberately lose the war in iraq because they believe it will be politically popular don t be surprised when he she starts planning to lose the war in afghanistan too _meta_end_dot_

 but wait you re probably thinking isn t that the good war _meta_end_question_

 aren t we fighting al qaeda there aren t we fighting al qaeda in iraq _meta_end_question_

 aren t our nato allies helping us out _meta_end_question_

 it just doesn t matter to the left _meta_end_dot_

 if they get their way in iraq look for arguments like this one from eric margolis to become the conventional wisdom with liberals at this week s nato conference in vilnius lithuania an angry u s _meta_end_dot_

 secretary of defence robert gates accused some europeans of not being prepared to fight and die in afghanistan in the battle against the taliban _meta_end_dot_

 the undiplomatic gates is quite right _meta_end_dot_

 most europeans regard the afghan conflict as a _meta_end_dot_

 wrong and immoral b _meta_end_dot_

 america s war c _meta_end_dot_

 all about oil or d _meta_end_dot_

 probably lost _meta_end_dot_

 to many europeans the nato alliance was created to deter the real threat of soviet aggression not to supply foot soldiers for george bush s wars in the muslim world _meta_end_dot_

 while gates and the harper government were pleading for more troops the commander of the _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ nato troops in afghanistan u s _meta_end_dot_

 gen _meta_end_dot_

 dan mcneill landed a bombshell _meta_end_dot_

 if proper u s _meta_end_dot_

 military counter insurgency doctrine were followed mcneill admitted the u s _meta_end_dot_

 and nato would need _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ troops to defeat pashtun tribal resistance in afghanistan _meta_end_dot_

 when the soviets occupied afghanistan they deployed _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ troops and about _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ afghan communist troops yet failed to crush the mostly pashtun resistance _meta_end_dot_

 now the u s _meta_end_dot_

 and nato are trying the same mission with only _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ troops backed by local mercenaries grandly styled the afghan national army _meta_end_dot_

 canada s calls for _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ more nato troops and the u s _meta_end_dot_

 decision to send _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ marines will not alter the course of this war which is turning increasingly against the western occupiers _meta_end_dot_

 in fact the war is spreading into neighbouring pakistan a nation of _meta_number_ref_ million stretching u s _meta_end_dot_

 and nato forces ever thinner _meta_end_dot_

 by pushing nato towards a bridge too far the bush administration may end up fatally undermining the alliance and encouraging anti american forces in europe _meta_end_dot_

 in fact it s becoming evident that the cash strapped u s _meta_end_dot_

 needs the eu more than the eu needs the u s _meta_end_dot_

 final point _meta_end_dot_

 if impassioned claims by u s _meta_end_dot_

 and canadian politicians that the little afghanistan war must by won at all costs then why don t they stop orating impose conscription and send _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ soldiers including their own sons to fight in afghanistan _meta_end_question_

 of course they won t _meta_end_dot_

 they prefer to waste their own soldiers and grind up afghanistan rather than admit this war against _meta_number_ref_ million pashtun tribesmen was a terrible mistake that will only get worse _meta_end_dot_

 see _meta_end_question_

 it s an unwinnable quagmire and besides why would europe even want to ally with the us to occupy afghanistan in an immoral and wrong war for oil _meta_end_question_

 why the us better wake up to the fact that we need the military help of europe more than they need our military help even though we have the best military that has ever existed and all of europe combined with the exception of britain probably couldn t fend off a few hundred angry girl scouts _meta_end_dot_

 yep either we have to draft hundreds of thousands of americans or declare defeat and call the whole thing off _meta_end_dot_

 today some liberal doofus on the smirking chimp website is making these arguments but in a couple of years it ll be people like barack obama hillary clinton ted kennedy john murtha or russ feingold saying many of these same things if the democrats get in the white house _meta_end_dot_

 blaming america first undercutting our national security and making things easier on our enemies is just what they do _meta_end_dot_
