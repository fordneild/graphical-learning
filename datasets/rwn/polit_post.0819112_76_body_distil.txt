  what good is the united nations when this sort of thing happens caroline knows all too well _meta_end_dot_

 it was a week before the election and the trouble was getting worse she said _meta_end_dot_

 the zanu pf chairman said that in the eighties when there was war girls fought too so we need them to fight this time too so the boys drew up lists of all the teenage girls in their neighbourhood and went to take them from their houses caroline was led to a house in adbeni used as a militia base _meta_end_dot_

 opposition supporters were taken there from the pungwes indoctrination meetings held elsewhere _meta_end_dot_

 caroline was led into a room by two older militia leaders in their twenties to administer a beating _meta_end_dot_

 but instead they raped me the two of them in turn afterwards they took her to another room where a woman was lying face down on the ground _meta_end_dot_

 they told her she must beat her with the rope and baton they had given her _meta_end_dot_

 i said how can i beat her she is older than me _meta_end_question_

 how can i beat someone who is like my mother my grandmother the face of her own mother two years dead from aids loomed in front of her _meta_end_dot_

 but she remembered the horror of the rape and did what she was told _meta_end_dot_

 the next day she ran away from mbare to her grandmother s house in highfield _meta_end_dot_

 but her older brother went looking for her _meta_end_dot_

 she had not told him the truth about what happened _meta_end_dot_

 a country descends into lawlessness and brutality and the united nation haggles _meta_end_dot_

 the sanctions proposed by the united states include an arms embargo as well as a travel ban and financial freeze against mr _meta_end_dot_

 children being forced to rape and be raped _meta_end_dot_

 parents of the opposition helpless and exposed _meta_end_dot_
