  i was interested in this post which revisits a familiar topic namely the wife who doesn t treat her husband with the godd mned common courtesy you d extend to a drunken bum pounding on your front door at one o clock in the morning _meta_end_dot_

 i think we can all admit it s a situation far more familiar in day to day living than it is in conversation we tend not to discuss it _meta_end_dot_

 even when confronted with it directly we still don t audibly notice it or comment on it _meta_end_dot_

 i met a young couple the other day with three little boys _meta_end_dot_

 the father who was in the military was getting ready to leave in a couple of days for iraq _meta_end_dot_

 as i chatted with them i tried to think of a way to convey my thanks to him for putting his life on the line in the service of our country i tried to think of a way to express my concern and my empathy for him and his family _meta_end_dot_

 as i was half listening to the conversation and half trying to decide the best way to express my gratitude and concern to virtual strangers something happened that really made me sad _meta_end_dot_

 i was speaking to the wife and the youngest son barely a toddler decided he wanted to try and tackle the staircase _meta_end_dot_

 as he attempted to go downstairs his oldest brother got in front of him and stopped him _meta_end_dot_

 the toddler got upset at this impediment and started crying _meta_end_dot_

 the mother saw what was happening and began reprimanding her older son for upsetting the baby _meta_end_dot_

 upon this the father stepped forward in defense of his son and explained to his wife that he d told the boy to watch his brother and not let him go downstairs _meta_end_dot_

 his wife s response was to roll her eyes and yell hello _meta_end_exclamation_

 who s the adult here _meta_end_question_

 you don t put your six year old son in charge of the baby you do it yourself _meta_end_dot_

 my gosh _meta_end_exclamation_

 am i the only adult around here _meta_end_dot_

 can t i trust you to handle anything then she turned back to me rolled her eyes and apologized i m sure for the alleged stupidity of her husband and not her own behavior and politely continued our conversation _meta_end_dot_

 confirmation bias in psychology and cognitive science confirmation bias is a tendency to search for or interpret new information in a way that confirms one s preconceptions and avoids information and interpretations which contradict prior beliefs _meta_end_dot_

 it is a type of cognitive bias and represents an error of inductive inference or as a form of selection bias toward confirmation of the hypothesis under study or disconfirmation of an alternative hypothesis _meta_end_dot_

 confirmation bias is of interest in the teaching of critical thinking as the skill is misused if rigorous critical scrutiny is applied only to evidence challenging a preconceived idea but not to evidence supporting it _meta_end_dot_

 another causative factor seems to be that society pressures women into certain things _meta_end_dot_

 among these acquiring the proper accessories cell phone purse dog to carry in the purse husband _meta_end_dot_

 meanwhile there is no opposing pressure for women to partner up with a good joe and really share a life with him _meta_end_dot_

 so it s easy for a dude to fall into that trap of becoming an accessory _meta_end_dot_

 and every noun has a verb _meta_end_dot_

 you talk a phone you carry a purse you cuddle a dog and the fella well if your girlfriend is scolding her fella and talking down to him and you re treating yours with some measure of respect why that s just uncool on you _meta_end_dot_

 and so there is this race among the fashion minded _meta_end_dot_

 a race to be nasty condescending and rude _meta_end_dot_

 a race to bark out orders the fastest _meta_end_dot_

 and familiarity of course _meta_end_dot_

 familiarity breeds contempt _meta_end_dot_

 the crazy bag lady pounding on your door in the middle of the night she s still entitled to some please and thank you _meta_end_dot_

 husbands not so much _meta_end_dot_

 we shouldn t forget protocol _meta_end_dot_

 women excel at learning protocol at incorporating and becoming acclimated to a new social custom _meta_end_dot_

 and protocol is really nothing more than stigma _meta_end_dot_

 it should come as no news to anyone over the age of thirty that our modern society has been subject to a battery of social changes in the last few years which are new stigmatizations _meta_end_dot_

 treating a man with courtesy decency and deference has become one of the stigmatizations _meta_end_dot_

 it s supposed to be all about equality _meta_end_dot_

 but it really isn t is it _meta_end_question_

 on this point the woman henpecking her husband in front of strangers or near strangers is a discredit to society in general _meta_end_dot_

 she demonstrates that we have elevated rudeness to a fundamental of some misguided new form of etiquette _meta_end_dot_

 and she proves that those among us who have not actively promoted it have passively accepted it _meta_end_dot_

 substantial numbers among our ladies it would appear would rather stand accused of being impolite and even uncultured than of being known as a stepford wife stepford wife _meta_number_ref_ used to describe a servile compliant submissive spineless wife who happily does her husband s bidding and serves his every whim dutifully _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ can also be used to describe a wife who is cookie cutter bland in appearance and behavior _meta_end_dot_

 subscribes to a popular look and dares not deviate from that look _meta_end_dot_

 this term is borrowed from the fictional suburb of stepford connecticut in ira levin s _meta_number_ref_ novel the stepford wives later made into movies in _meta_number_ref_ and _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 in the story men of this seemingly ideal town have replaced their wives with attractive robotic dolls devoid of emotion or thought _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ she s such a stepford wife i ve seen her greet her husband at the door after work with a beer and a kiss _meta_number_ref_ days in a row _meta_end_exclamation_

 _meta_number_ref_ i just got back from the pta meeting i ve never seen so many stepford wives _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_b the snl skit mom jeans features women dressed to earn the sw distinction _meta_end_dot_

 katharine ross movie and i ve seen nicole kidman s version _meta_end_dot_

 both of them looked to me like movies with happy endings in the middle with events taking a downward tailspin toward the closing credits _meta_end_dot_

 i never did get the impression i was tuned in to the desired mood in either one of those the middle events seem dark like i m supposed to read some kind of tragedy into a situation where a man is relaxing in a comfy chair and his missus is bringing him brandy and cigars _meta_end_dot_

 what s the problem _meta_end_question_

 i mean yeah maybe it s not an ideal situation to have your lady replaced by a robot _meta_end_dot_

 but perhaps asking the question remains worthwhile because the story that is being told on an emotional level strikes me as vague _meta_end_dot_

 i mean what s the problem that our heroes are supposed to solve here _meta_end_question_

 that the wife has been abducted _meta_end_question_

 that her role has been displaced by a robot _meta_end_question_

 or that the husband s expectations might be raised here insofar as what s supposed to happen in his marriage _meta_end_question_

 because i can t help but get the feeling things are at a low nadir because there s something repugnant about doing nice things for your husband _meta_end_dot_

 why we can t have that those husbands might start talking to each other and getting ideas _meta_end_exclamation_

 if that wasn t the intended message perhaps there needed to have been some clarification _meta_end_dot_

 in both movies _meta_end_dot_

 but the real problem it seems to me is that some of these wives are cultivating relationships with other women that are more important than the relationships they have with their husbands _meta_end_dot_

 even with women who are complete strangers _meta_end_dot_

 i remember years ago when i was still living in seattle some of the other computer nerds who lived there had a joke they liked to tell _meta_end_dot_

 a young software engineer was being considered for a job and he wasn t able to set up an interview during working hours so he agreed to meet his prospective new employer at the space needle _meta_end_dot_

 he ordered an ice water for himself and then he looked over at the next booth and saw none other than bill gates _meta_end_dot_

 he was so excited and even moreso when he realized what a decent and approachable guy mr _meta_end_dot_

 gates was _meta_end_dot_

 they talked for a few minutes and finally he worked up the nerve to ask bill gates for a favor _meta_end_dot_

 i have a job interview here in a few minutes he said _meta_end_dot_

 i m terribly worried about how to make a good impression and i was wondering if you could pop by a few minutes into it and act as if you know me bill gates thought for a minute and said why sure _meta_end_dot_

 i m sure i could handle that the interview proceeded as planned _meta_end_dot_

 about ten minutes in bill gates was getting ready to go _meta_end_dot_

 but he made good on his promise politely broke in and said to the young man hey jack didn t want to interrupt _meta_end_dot_

 wonderful seeing you again the young man said gates _meta_end_exclamation_

 piss off _meta_end_dot_

 i m in a meeting seems to me to be an apt illustration of what s happening in marriages like the one described in the above linked article the trashing of a person who s supposed to be a compatriot for sake of ingratiating oneself with strangers _meta_end_dot_

 it is essentially an exercise in making new friends an exercise that if it succeeds befriends those who probably don t make very good friends _meta_end_dot_

 it isn t a problem with women being uppity or forgetting their place or failing to show the proper subservience the good lord intended _meta_end_dot_

 it isn t a matter of becoming a stepford wife _meta_end_dot_

 it s an issue of simple human decency good manners and sharing your life with a person the way you said you were going to _meta_end_dot_

 and not wasting theirs _meta_end_dot_

 socially it really doesn t take very much at all to make the point _meta_end_dot_

 a good natured cheerful smile with a friendly i don t think that s appropriate can do wonders _meta_end_dot_
