  the liberal ninnies that have been able to take control of the schools have in some cases at least already banned tag and touch football and now they re coming for the slides for half a century youngsters have enjoyed the _meta_number_ref_ft slide in the playground with no more serious mishap than the occasional bruise or grazed knee _meta_end_dot_

 many of the parents bringing their children had themselves played on the towering steel structure years ago _meta_end_dot_

 the slide was fenced off last summer while investigations into a nearby collapsed drain were carried out _meta_end_dot_

 it has now been dismantled amid concerns that it could cause serious injury _meta_end_dot_

 a spokesman for birmingham botanical gardens admitted yesterday that parents had complained about the decision but confirmed that the slide will not be coming back _meta_end_dot_

 instead officials plan to install a safer replacement with higher sides when a suitable model has been identified for the playground in edgbaston a stone s throw from the city centre _meta_end_dot_

 local conservative councillor james hutchings said it s completely mad the way we are being run ragged by the health and safety mafia _meta_end_dot_

 children are not going to learn how to judge risks or how to have fun if challenging play equipment such as this is denied them _meta_end_dot_

 if there hadn t been an accident in _meta_number_ref_ years then the chances are there s not much wrong with this slide it s a pretty good trick that the left has pulled off here and overseas _meta_end_dot_

 no tag no touch football no slides mediocre education global warming propaganda and gay propaganda and trying to build self esteem in kids in every way humanly possible except actually having them become good at things _meta_end_dot_

 every generation the left makes public education ever more mediocre and yet because they re so interested in brainwashing kids and funneling money to their union allies they ve managed to convince people that they re the ones who care more than us eeeevvvviiiilllll conservatives who unlike the libs are all about improving the quality of children s education and helping them prepare for life _meta_end_dot_

 hat tip to moonbattery for the story _meta_end_dot_
