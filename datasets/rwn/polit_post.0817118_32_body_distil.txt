  s o where are we in the discussion about using present energy sources oil while we get our ducks in a row concerning replacement alternative and renewable fuels _meta_end_question_

 in a word nowhere _meta_end_dot_

 it should come as no surprise to anyone that like social security and medicare politicians on both sides of the isle have ignored the looming energy crisis for decades _meta_end_dot_

 well guess what it is no longer a looming crisis it s here _meta_end_dot_

 and what have we to show for it _meta_end_question_

 record prices increasing global demand for the only fuel presently available in quantity to meet that demand and an energy policy which can only be described as absolutely unresponsive to the public need _meta_end_dot_

 or if your prefer pure garbage _meta_end_dot_

 for _meta_number_ref_ years our politicians have ignored this problem even when hints in the _meta_number_ref_s and _meta_number_ref_s gave them a glimpse of what was to come _meta_end_dot_

 they stubbornly refused to address the growing problem _meta_end_dot_

 instead they ignored it _meta_end_dot_

 you see actually addressing the energy problem would have required they admit that while the ultimate solution must come from all areas of energy production in the short term it must be primarily oil and coal _meta_end_dot_

 but to admit that they would have had to actually risk their political careers _meta_end_dot_

 they d have had to make the case to the public that in order for there to be true energy independence more nuclear power along with vastly increased exploitation of existing known oil reserves and more refinery capacity would have to be an integral part of any such a policy for the foreseeable future _meta_end_dot_

 instead for the most part they took the easy road drank the popular environmental kool aid touted alternative fuel vaporware as being just around the corner banned drilling crippled our ability to build nuclear power plants and oil refineries and blindly ignored the intensifying global demand for energy _meta_end_dot_

 now faced with the reality of _meta_dollor_ref_ a gallon gas and the prospect of that never coming down again they re like deer caught in the headlights _meta_end_dot_

 and when confronted with the reality that oil must be an integral and growing part of at least the short term solution to our energy problem the usual suspects retreat into the cave begin banging their tribal one note drum and resort to petulant insult rather than signaling a willingness to discuss changing their mind for the good of their fellow citizens _meta_end_dot_

 a typical example of that would be the senate majority leader harry reid who while respectfully calling the vice president oil man cheney said this so all that cheney can talk about the oil man cheney can talk about is drilling drilling drilling _meta_end_dot_

 but there is not enough oil in america to make that the salvation to our problems of course the _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ trillion barrels sitting in western us shale alone not to mention the _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ billion barrels offshore show harry reid to either be incredibly ignorant in which case he should just keep quiet or a plain old liar _meta_end_dot_

 the fact is the shale reserve alone would fulfill all our energy needs for about _meta_number_ref_ years _meta_end_dot_

 giving reid the benefit of the doubt he doesn t deserve as well as a very forgiving interpretation of his statement perhaps what he is actually trying to say in his own muddled way is that oil isn t the salvation to our problems well i m sure this will come as a complete surprise to mr _meta_end_dot_

 reid but as far as i know no one is arguing it is _meta_end_exclamation_

 what is instead being argued in the absence of an energy policy for which sen _meta_end_dot_

 reid bears direct responsibility is that oil exploration and exploitation may be the solution to our energy needs in the short term while we try to make up for reid s _meta_number_ref_ years of incompetence and politically motivated short sightedness _meta_end_dot_

 it is he and those like him who have been instrumental in landing us in the mess we face today _meta_end_dot_

 instead of facing up to what he has failed to do while a member of the senate reid childishly prefers to throw stones at the vice president _meta_end_dot_

 and speaker pelosi is no better the president s proposal sounds like another page from the administration s energy policy that was literally written by the oil industry give away more public resources to the very same oil companies that are sitting on _meta_number_ref_ million acres of federal lands they ve already leased of course as with most things she says she s clueless about her claims _meta_end_dot_

 for those who are interested an oil expert explains what pelosi and steny hoyer seem not to understand some lawmakers state that oil companies currently hold millions of acres of leases that are not producing _meta_end_dot_

 this is true but not for the reasons politicians would have you believe _meta_end_dot_

 it seems the lawmakers would have us believe that oil and gas exist beneath every acre of every lease the government issues that obtaining a lease was a virtual guarantee that the lease holder would strike oil and gas or both _meta_end_dot_

 obviously that s absurd _meta_end_dot_

 if it weren t i d be on line at the department of interior trying to buy an acre or two for myself _meta_end_dot_

 drilling costs money _meta_end_dot_

 thus oil companies have developed very sophisticated methods of exploring for oil and gas that don t require the erection of a rig and any actual drilling which is very expensive until they re pretty darn sure there s a good bit of oil down there _meta_end_dot_

 then and only then do they commit to a test well _meta_end_dot_

 so what they are looking for as they check these leases out is enough recoverable oil to make drilling a test well worthwhile _meta_end_dot_

 if they are holding a lease you can pretty much bet the house that they ve processed that lease and the reason there isn t an oil rig on it is because they ve determined it to either be without oil or without enough recoverable oil to make it economically feasible to drill _meta_end_dot_

 and with vast swaths of this country not producing a drop of oil because those two conditions exist it isn t at all infeasible that _meta_number_ref_ million acres fit that description as well is it _meta_end_question_

 anyway here we have an actual crisis laying in the laps of the leaders in congress who by the way promised they d lower the price of gas when they were running their _meta_number_ref_ campaign remember _meta_end_question_

 and when presented the opportunity to actually do something about it they punt _meta_end_dot_

 their response is to point fingers insult lie and blame big oil without ever doing anything positive to help the situation _meta_end_dot_

 it is an amazing performance _meta_end_dot_

 i can t wait until they suddenly realize that almost _meta_percent_ref_ of the country wants to see drilling increased offshore in order to drive gas prices down _meta_end_dot_

 i would imagine the reversal of their present positions will be so stunningly swift that both reid and pelosi will suffer from whiplash _meta_end_dot_

 in the meantime every time you fill up your car with that ever more expensive gallon of gas you know exactly who to blame for being in this predicament _meta_end_dot_

 pelosi and reid aren t the only one s who ve gotten us into this mess _meta_end_dot_

 many of the others have a big old r behind they re name _meta_end_dot_

 pelosi and reid are simply the current crop _meta_end_dot_

 but they still deserve a giant heaping helping of the blame and i think we ought to make sure they know we re well aware of that fact and not let them play the blame shifting game congressional hearings with big oil anyone of which they re so fond _meta_end_dot_
