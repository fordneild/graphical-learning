  there s no need for the mariners to apologize for this most of the time a kiss is just a kiss in the stands at seattle mariners games _meta_end_dot_

 the crowd hardly even pays attention when fans smooch _meta_end_dot_

 but then last week a lesbian complained that an usher at safeco field asked her to stop kissing her date because it was making another fan uncomfortable _meta_end_dot_

 the incident has exploded on local tv on talk radio and in the blogosphere and has touched off a debate over public displays of affection in generally gay friendly seattle _meta_end_dot_

 certain individuals have not yet caught up _meta_end_dot_

 those people see a gay or lesbian couple and they stare or say something said josh friedes of equal rights washington _meta_end_dot_

 this is one of the challenges of being gay _meta_end_dot_

 everyday things can become sources of trauma as the mariners played the boston red sox on may _meta_number_ref_ sirbrina guerrero and her date were approached in the third inning by an usher who told them their kissing was inappropriate guerrero said _meta_end_dot_

 the usher guerrero said told them he had received a complaint from a woman nearby who said that there were kids in the crowd of nearly _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ and that parents would have to explain why two women were kissing _meta_end_dot_

 i was really just shocked guerrero said _meta_end_dot_

 seattle is so gay friendly _meta_end_dot_

 there was a couple like seven rows ahead making out _meta_end_dot_

 we were just showing affection on monday mariners spokeswoman rebecca hale said that the club is investigating but that the usher was responding to a complaint of two women making out and groping in the stands _meta_end_dot_

 we have a strict non discrimination policy at the seattle mariners and at safeco field and when we do enforce the code of conduct it is based on behavior not on the identity of those involved hale said _meta_end_dot_

 the code of conduct announced before each game specifically mentions public displays of affection that are not appropriate in a public family setting hale said those standards are based on what a reasonable person would find inappropriate _meta_end_dot_

 guerrero denied she and her date were groping each other saying that along with eating garlic fries they were giving each other brief kisses _meta_end_dot_

 first of all public displays of affection make some people uncomfortable and that s why it was entirely appropriate for the mariners not to allow that behavior at their games _meta_end_dot_

 if people don t like that they can pick out a better make out spot than in the stands of a mariner s game and honestly just about everywhere is a better make out spot than in the stands of a mariners game _meta_end_dot_

 now the article complains that there were other people in the crowd making out who got away with it _meta_end_dot_

 that may be true but so what _meta_end_question_

 if you get a speeding ticket is it invalidated because someone else got away with speeding on the same highway _meta_end_question_

 of course there s a little he said she said issue going on the mariners say the gay couple was making out and groping while the women say they were just giving each other a little kiss here and there so what _meta_end_question_

 they were told the rules up front they were arguably breaking the rules just by kissing and it s the mariners ballpark _meta_end_dot_

 if they don t like that then they should go spend their money elsewhere instead of trying to turn the whole thing into a gay rights issue _meta_end_dot_

 ps given the exhibitionism whininess and urge to offend people that s so common in the gay community today the next home game will probably be a nightmare _meta_end_dot_

 for example don t be surprised if two gay guys start having sex in front of a group of _meta_number_ref_rd graders at the next mariners game because they believe it strikes some sort of blow for gay rights _meta_end_dot_
