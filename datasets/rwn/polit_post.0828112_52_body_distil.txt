  one happy side effect of the obama campaign is that it s going to destroy the effectiveness of the left s that s racist attack forever _meta_end_dot_

 as the phrase is used more and more in increasingly ridiculous ways people are becoming numb to it and if people are indifferent to being called racist because it s so overused it has no power _meta_end_dot_

 yes there may be rare times when that s racist is genuinely called for but america isn t a racist society white people are as likely to be held back by racism as blacks these days and the old democratic kkk style bigots other than robert byrd are almost universally considered to be fringe loonies _meta_end_dot_

 so it s about time we got to this point _meta_end_dot_

 ps next step killing affirmative action which is racist un american and should be unconstitutional once and for all _meta_end_dot_
