  i m considering picking up a cell phone and i want to get a little advice _meta_end_dot_

 here s my situation i do need a standard phone line because my local company forces me to get one to have dsl _meta_end_dot_

 moreover i need a clear line to do interviews and teleconferences over _meta_end_dot_

 so it probably wouldn t make sense to completely switch over to a cell phone _meta_end_dot_

 however i would like to have a cell phone that i could use for emergencies in the car and on business trips _meta_end_dot_

 the extras on a cell phone mp_meta_number_ref_ player camera texting would be a real bonus but probably not a necessity _meta_end_dot_
