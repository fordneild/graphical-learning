  the _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ gitmo decision brings to the front yet again john mccain s position on judges versus his own policies _meta_end_dot_

 mccain undoubtedly supports the _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ decision yet the justices who voted against it and argued strenuously against it are of the kind mccain claims to want on the bench _meta_end_dot_

 we have seen the same issue arise respecting campaign finance _meta_end_dot_

 this is not to say that mccain won t nominate originalists to the bench _meta_end_dot_

 but if he does he will be nominating to the court individuals who are better adherents to the constitution than he is mark levin
