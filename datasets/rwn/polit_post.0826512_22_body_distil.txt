  in _meta_number_ref_ the long fought for and long admired democracy of the united states of america began a slow and steady decline toward fascism a bush family tradition with the installment of a president a man the citizens overwhelmingly rejected although the funny math told a still believed myth by a few corrupt judges on the us supreme court _meta_end_dot_

 that coup is now nearly complete and checkmate is all but unavoidable _meta_end_dot_

 they just can t _meta_end_dot_

 let _meta_end_dot_

 it _meta_end_dot_

 go _meta_end_dot_

 larisa alexandrovna the screed writer should probably go back and take politics _meta_number_ref_ so that she can understand that bush took office in january _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 let me first point you to the bush administration s so called wall street bailout bill here so that you can see for yourself that this treachery is being conducted in the light of day _meta_end_dot_

 fascism is finally and formally out of the right wing closet even if the f word is not yet openly being used although it should be and often _meta_end_dot_

 uh huh _meta_end_dot_

 ok _meta_end_dot_

 sure _meta_end_dot_

 prozac time _meta_end_exclamation_

 now if you do not yet understand that the wall street crisis is a man made disaster done through intentional deregulation and corruption i have a bridge in alaska to sell to you or sara palin does anyway _meta_end_dot_

 this manufactured crisis is now to be remedied if the fiscal fascists get their way with the total transfer of congressional powers the few that still remain to the executive branch and the total transfer of public funds into corporate via government as intermediary hands _meta_end_dot_

 oooooooh intentional _meta_end_dot_

 the housing and financial meltdown was probably planned by bush cheney and rove back in _meta_number_ref_ or so i would have to guess _meta_end_dot_

 and maybe if the democrat led congress wasn t altogether incompetent unable unfit and unqualified to deal with the wall street crisis per their own words _meta_end_exclamation_

 queen nancy and dingy harry plan on adjourning congress with this crisis going on acknowledging that they are plain clueless _meta_end_dot_

 but sure know how to play the political game _meta_end_dot_

 rather they saying gee let s try and fix this mess and worry about our talking points later the democrats are attempting to use the financial problems to play political games _meta_end_dot_

 however it does look like queen nancy is going to take her sweet time dealing with treasury secretary paulson s recommendations _meta_end_dot_

 anyhow it is quite amusing watching a complete barking moonbat meltdown _meta_end_dot_

 consider the folks on the right who write similar missives are on the fringes of the right o sphere and generally ignored _meta_end_dot_

 those who pull this on the left are the mainstream _meta_end_dot_

 it is the sane ones who are considered fringe in the left o sphere _meta_end_dot_

 but what else should we expect from managing news editor at raw story _meta_end_question_

 and you folks have got to check out her unhinged blog where everything is like facism this and nazi that _meta_end_dot_

 she also has a problem with stop the aclu and protein wisdom for having a problem with this story _meta_end_dot_

 she s a bit thin skinned eh _meta_end_question_
