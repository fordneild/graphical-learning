  a couple of days ago i had the misfortune of being on a bbc radio show with an american college professor who sounded like he had read one too many noam chomsky books _meta_end_dot_

 let me give you a short impression of the guy blah blah blah racists _meta_end_exclamation_

 blah blah blah of course jeremiah wright was right when he said blah blah blah _meta_end_dot_

 no wonder people are angry at america not to disagree with professor crabby mccommiepuss but there is no nation in the world that has more to be proud of and less to apologize for than the united states of america _meta_end_dot_

 of course the standard liberal reply to that usually goes something like this so you re saying we re perfect huh _meta_end_question_

 well what about slavery and the indians and dropping a bombs in wwii and the other _meta_number_ref_ things on my what i hate about america list what about them _meta_end_question_

 men have been enslaving other men for thousands of years _meta_end_dot_

 it s nothing new _meta_end_dot_

 what was new was a nation so disgusted by the practice that they fought a civil war to put an end to it _meta_end_dot_

 but what about the indians _meta_end_question_

 sure we took their land and treated them brutally _meta_end_dot_

 however my friend that s just the history of the world _meta_end_dot_

 there probably is not a square yard of earth on the map that wasn t taken by force from one group of people by another group at one time or another _meta_end_dot_

 as to hiroshima and nagasaki given the fanatical tenacity with which the japanese had been holding on we probably saved hundreds of thousands of civilian lives by dropping those bombs rather than invading the mainland _meta_end_dot_

 much more importantly we saved the lives of hundreds of thousands of american soldiers who had risked their lives to protect their country and free the world from the nazi japanese vision of the future which was as george orwell described it a boot stamping on a human face forever we could go on and on with these the glass is half full _meta_end_exclamation_

 no it isn t it s half empty examples but why should we do that when we can consider all the good america has done in the world during it s historically short reign as a super power _meta_end_dot_

 we ve saved the free world from tyranny in the _meta_number_ref_th century not once wwi not twice wwii but three times the cold war _meta_end_dot_

 we ve done more to promote capitalism and democracy than any other _meta_number_ref_ nations combined _meta_end_dot_

 we ve gone to the moon we ve fed the world and we ve fought more tyrants terrorists and thugs than any comic book super hero _meta_end_dot_

 speaking of comic book super heroes american gets the same sort of daily bugle treatment that spider man did in the comics and the movies _meta_end_dot_

 we shed our blood and treasure by the bucket load to do good and the headlines in the paper read out of control menace terrorizes populace probably the best example of this is the topsy turvy world interpretation of the events that led up to _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 it goes all the way back to when the soviets waged a war of conquest on afghanistan _meta_end_dot_

 of course when the bad guys are kicking in your door who ya gonna call _meta_end_question_

 the united states of course and we delivered _meta_end_dot_

 we gave billions of dollars worth of aid and weaponry to the mujahideen which they used to drive the soviets out of their country _meta_end_dot_

 then a little later on when the afghan people were starving which country was supplying most of their food even though we weren t particularly friendly with their government or their pals al qaeda _meta_end_question_

 that s right the united states _meta_end_dot_

 sure we could have pointed to the taliban and al qaeda and said afghanistan isn t friendly to us so let them starve but we didn t do that because we re a compassionate people _meta_end_dot_

 then the terrorists based in afghanistan pull off _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ and what s the liberal european reaction _meta_end_question_

 the chickens have come home to roost or alternately some variation of amos brown s comments america america _meta_end_dot_

 what did you do either intentionally or unintentionally in the world order in central america in africa where bombs are still blasting _meta_end_question_

 america what did you do in the global warming conference when you did not embrace the smaller nations _meta_end_question_

 america what did you do two weeks ago when i stood at the world conference on racism when you wouldn t show up _meta_end_question_

 oh america what did you do what did america do _meta_end_question_

 america helped afghanistan drive out the soviet union we fed them then they repaid the favor by bombing the wtc and pentagon _meta_end_dot_

 after that instead of walking in there and killing everything that moved we responded by getting rid of the tyrants that ran their country giving them billions in aid and installing a democracy which has been defended with the lives of american soldiers _meta_end_dot_

 moreover this is not an aberration it s typical of american behavior since the start of the _meta_number_ref_th century _meta_end_dot_

 but instead of thanks we get grumbling complaining and snark not just from people who live in nations that are only free and prosperous because of our help but from people who ve managed to make wonderful lives for themselves in this country _meta_end_dot_

 yes we live in a country where celebrities who ve become rich and famous sneer at the country that gave them that opportunity where college professors teach their students that the country that s given them an opportunity to get an education is evil and where small patriotic gestures like saying the pledge of allegiance or wearing a flag pin are considered anathema by many people on the left _meta_end_dot_

 well i can t speak for anyone else but i m sick of it _meta_end_dot_

 as far as i m concerned america along with capitalism and christianity has been one of the greatest forces for good the world has seen in centuries _meta_end_dot_

 moreover americans have no need to apologize because our ancestors did something we sneer at today in the civilized nation they helped bring about because we re prosperous or because some snobbish liberal or foreigner doesn t like us _meta_end_dot_

 quite frankly if you think america is a terrible country or isn t an incredible force for good in the world you re either stupid ignorant hoodwinked blinded crazy or liberal which all too often turns out to be a combination of all five of those characteristics _meta_end_dot_
