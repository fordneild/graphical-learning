  ric flair the nature boy is the man who wears the crimson mask better than any wrestler who ever lived and has a little saying if you want to be the man you have to beat the man _meta_end_dot_

 the latter the man was usually him and that statement was usually followed with a grand smackdown the likes of which wouldn t be seen again until the next week on wwe s monday night raw _meta_end_dot_

 now though it looks like flair is making a little room for someone new to be the man _meta_end_dot_

 he s endorsed mike huckabee which adds yet another cool quirky character to huckabee s celebrity endorsement roster _meta_end_dot_

 that roster s getting pretty interesting too _meta_end_dot_

 flair makes a trio of genuine tough guys along with ted nugent and chuck norris _meta_end_dot_

 the implication is clear _meta_end_dot_

 though he may look soft and meek mike huckabee is the candidate for real butt kicking gun toting illegal foreign obect into the ring bringing manly men _meta_end_exclamation_

 that s just fine with me _meta_end_dot_

 the republican race really has been boring me silly _meta_end_dot_

 it could use some life in it that s more than polling wonks going at each other with metaphorical two by fours _meta_end_dot_

 come to think of it why should the two by fours be metaphorical _meta_end_question_

 let s have a polling wonk hardcore match _meta_end_exclamation_

 with special guest referee ric flair wooooooo and guest commentators ted nugent and chuck norris _meta_end_dot_

 can t you just see the marquee right now _meta_end_question_

 and who wouldn t pay to see john zogby go upside the head of someone from team gallup with a barbed wire wrapped plank _meta_end_question_

 the opinion dynamics duo ganging up on some lone rasmussen guy and beating him down with thick copies of their methodology and yelling margin of error this _meta_end_dot_

 i think it d sell _meta_end_dot_

 but maybe that s just me _meta_end_dot_

 meanwhile the comment section at the link is just chock full of the same condescending elitist sniffling at the uneducated rubes that got the democrats butts handed to them not that long ago _meta_end_dot_

 i surely hope they keep up their snobbery _meta_end_dot_

 nothing plays better to the electorate than a bunch of snotty put downs about pick up trucks and drinking beer as john kerry found out repeatedly in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 it s really bad huckabee wants to make fatty foods smoking and other similar pleasurable vices off limits _meta_end_dot_

 if not for the mile wide nanny state streak in him he d be a great candidate _meta_end_dot_
