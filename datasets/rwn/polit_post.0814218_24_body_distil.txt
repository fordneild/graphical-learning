  there s this thing about young voters _meta_end_dot_

 most of them are liberal mostly because most of them have had limited exposure to national politics and because most of them get that limited exposure in political science classes taught by people who study political theory for twenty years before they impart their hard earned wisdom onto our youth not people who need to use the actual american economy to sustain their existence _meta_end_dot_

 many of us and i use that term loosely also have a naive yet deeply ingrained need to fit in _meta_end_dot_

 the same compulsive behavior that leads young people to embrace formal short pants asian fusion cuisine gladiator sandals and chuck klosterman inspires their voting patters _meta_end_dot_

 yesterday _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ people showed up to hear obama speak and apparently to attend a concert by the indie rock band the decemberists who despite their strong continued attachment to whining rather than singing and their strange habit of singing a melody that doesn t match with the melody the backup band is playing is a pretty good if not remarkable band considering the dearth of good current music _meta_end_dot_

 the decemberists of course appeal to no one who has ever listened to tonal music which means no one over say _meta_number_ref_ but they do appeal to a key demographic people who vote for obama and people who listen to the decemberists _meta_end_question_

 they re the same people _meta_end_dot_

 from cnn to the new york times the media hyped barack obama s portland oregon rally on sunday some comparing him to a rock star _meta_end_dot_

 unmentioned in national reporting was the fact that obama was preceded by a rare _meta_number_ref_ minute free concert by actual rock stars the decemberists _meta_end_dot_

 the portland based band has drawn rave reviews from rolling stone magazine which gave their _meta_number_ref_ album picaresque four and a half stars out of five and another four and a half stars for _meta_number_ref_ s the crane wife _meta_end_dot_

 granted a free decemberists concert would draw me out of my hole too especially since based on my previous experience with the decemberists they aren t worth paying for no one s read a rolling stone s album review since they panned zepplin but there s a strong connection that it seems everyone s missed _meta_end_dot_

 kids in oregon are out of school for the summer there is a band playing for free that you typically have to pass an outfit check at a seedy warehouse in a re gentrified area of a major city to see its not that hot out and the kids get the bonus of participating in the political process without having to do any actual work _meta_end_dot_

 of course its going to pack to the perimeter _meta_end_dot_

 if they d given out coupons for a free tee shirt at urban outfitters they would have probably drawn a cool _meta_number_ref_k _meta_end_dot_

 and then there s this tiny secret about political rallies for college students that also seems to slip through the cracks they are a great way to meet young eligible ladies especially if you re liberal _meta_end_dot_

 so despite the nyt s puddle of drool obama has not yet acheived rock star status without the help of real rockers a lot of bored kids and a strong youthful commitment to utter and complete social conformity _meta_end_dot_

 of course had he managed to turn a few loaves and fishes into a meal of vegan pad thai for _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ i might be closer to agreeing that he s the messiah _meta_end_dot_

 and fortunately for us and possibly the future of music most of the same kids will tune out by november pulling in a measely _meta_percent_ref_ turnout for their age group nationwide and if early observation remains accurate half of that _meta_percent_ref_ will vote for either a third party candidate or ron paul whether or not he happens to be on the ballot _meta_end_dot_
