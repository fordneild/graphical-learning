  all change is not growth as all movement is not forward ellen glasgow as people who have followed barack obama closely over the last few months have long since realized there has been very little substance to the man s campaign besides his determination to lose oops i mean end the war in iraq _meta_end_dot_

 if you boil obama s appeal down to its essential core most of his supporters seem to like him because he s a relatively young charismatic black man who talks a lot about change unity and the audacity of hope but what does that tell you about how obama would behave if he gets into office _meta_end_question_

 very very little _meta_end_dot_

 after all pretty much anybody from napoleon to fidel castro to mickey mouse could run on a platform of hope change and unity because it s so broad and meaningless _meta_end_dot_

 of course that doesn t mean that barack doesn t have an agenda _meta_end_dot_

 he most certainly does have one but it s just an agenda that he tries to avoid talking about because the better americans get to know him the less appealing he s going to be _meta_end_dot_

 so with that in mind let me take you through a short tour of some of barack obama s radical beliefs _meta_end_dot_

 in all fairness i should note that he has flip flopped on some of these issues after his barney the dinosaur style i love you you love me campaign for the presidency got into full swing _meta_end_dot_

 but experience has taught us that you can put a lot more stock into what a politician says before he starts trying to desperately convince middle america to vote him into the white house than after _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ weakening america s military barack obama has pledged among other things to make defense cuts during war time to cut spending on national missile defense that he won t weaponize space to slow development of future combat systems and to seek a world without nuclear weapons is this a man who can be trusted as commander in chief _meta_end_question_

 _meta_number_ref_ losing the war in iraq obama is promising to throw away the hard earned gains our troops have made in iraq by immediately removing combat brigades each month regardless of the situation on the ground and by having all of our combat brigades out of iraq within _meta_number_ref_ months the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff publicly warned barack and for that matter hillary that they could create a chaotic situation with their policy that could take the gains we have achieved and struggled to achieve and turn them around overnight come on admiral don t you know that obama isn t going to listen to what the military has to say about a war when there s an election to be won _meta_end_question_

 _meta_number_ref_ gay marriage although barack obama claims to oppose gay marriage in _meta_number_ref_ he said that he opposed the defense of marriage act which is the only thing keeping the courts from imposing gay marriage on the whole country _meta_end_dot_

 if you want to see gay marriage become the law of the land in your state no matter what the voters think vote for obama _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ pro partial birth abortion it s never a surprise to find a democrat who s a big fan of abortion but obama goes above and beyond the call of duty _meta_end_dot_

 he had a perfect rating of _meta_percent_ref_ from naral in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ and _meta_number_ref_ opposes notifying parents of minors who get out of state abortions and he even opposed banning partial birth abortions _meta_end_dot_

 if you want to see as many women as humanly possible in this country putting their own children to death via abortion vote obama _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ legalizing marijuana obama a former we hope druggie who has admitted to using marijuana and cocaine has said that he favors decriminalizing marijuana perhaps you can t blame him for wanting to make it easier for people to get drugs since after all he used them and look how he turned out _meta_end_dot_

 if barack gets into the white house one day mothers all over america can tell their children that they ll never be anything in life if they use hard drugs and those children can reply well at least i can be president _meta_number_ref_ handing _meta_number_ref_ billion dollars of your money to other nations obama s global poverty act would commit the united states to spending over the next _meta_number_ref_ years _meta_number_ref_ billion dollars more than what we already do on global poverty _meta_end_dot_

 obama followed that up with a release that said in part it must be a priority of american foreign policy to commit to eliminating extreme poverty if obama actually believes that not only is the united states capable of eliminating extreme poverty but that we should actually make that utopian dream a priority then he s far too naive to be in the white house _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ if you think george bush is a big spender you haven t met obama even though the united states is already running a deficit obama is planning to push a whole host of new big government programs including a _meta_number_ref_ year _meta_dollor_ref_ billion program to establish a green energy sector a _meta_dollor_ref_ billion national infrastructure reinvestment bank and a nearly universal health care plan whose annual price tag he low balls at _meta_dollor_ref_ to _meta_dollor_ref_ billion if you re all for tax and spend liberalism and watching the deficit spiral even further out of control there s no one you should want in the white house more than obama _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ amnesty and your tax dollars for illegal aliens believe it or not john mccain the republican who is most closely associated with catering to illegal aliens is actually well to barack obama s right on the issue _meta_end_dot_

 obama favors drivers licenses for illegals wants to give illegals welfare and medicaid wants to let them participate in social security opposes making english our national language and he favors a comprehensive approach to illegal immigration aka amnesty that even john mccain now claims to oppose _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ gun control obama is a perfect example of the stereotypical liberal gun grabber _meta_end_dot_

 obama has pledged to ban the sale or transfer of all forms of semi automatic weapons has opined unequivocally that d c s ban was constitutional and in _meta_number_ref_ obama in a survey supported banning the manufacture sale and possession of handguns if you re an opponent of the _meta_number_ref_nd amendment who believes law abiding citizens shouldn t be allowed to defend themselves obama is your man _meta_end_dot_
