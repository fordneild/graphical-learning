  a large part of america s energy dependence on foreign sources can be traced to sept _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ when president bill clinton stood on the edge of the grand canyon on the arizona side and signed an executive proclamation making _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ million acres of utah a new national monument _meta_end_dot_

 at the time the clintons were worried that ralph nader s presence on the ballot in a few western states would draw green votes from clinton in a race that promised to be close after the gop retook congress two years earlier _meta_end_dot_

 in fact the declaration of _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ million utah acres as a national monument thereby depriving an energy starved u s _meta_end_dot_

 up to _meta_number_ref_ billion tons of environmentally safe low sulfur coal worth _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ trillion and minable with minimal surface impact was a political payoff to the family of james riady _meta_end_dot_

 he s the son of lippo group owner mochtar riady _meta_end_dot_

 james was found guilty of and paid a multimillion dollar fine for funneling more than _meta_dollor_ref_ million in illegal political contributions through lippo bank into various american political campaigns including bill clinton s presidential run in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_
