  h ow soon we forget _meta_end_dot_

 bill clinton a few nights ago he recalled that _meta_number_ref_ years ago republicans said i was too young and too inexperienced to be commander in chief _meta_end_dot_

 sound familiar _meta_end_question_

 it didn t work in _meta_number_ref_ and it will not work in _meta_number_ref_ really _meta_end_question_

 well it doesn t mean that democrats won t try rep _meta_end_dot_

 diana degette today the selection of governor palin is an insult to women _meta_end_dot_

 she has obviously been chosen to appeal to female voters but she lacks both the experience and policy positions to serve as vice president of the united states the announcement of governor palin s selection on john mccain s _meta_number_ref_nd birthday highlights the fact t hat the vice president must be qualified to step into the presidency from day one _meta_end_dot_

 sarah palin is a _meta_number_ref_ year governor with zero foreign policy experience whose former position was mayor of a town of _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ rahm emanuel after trying to make experience the issue of this campaign john mccain celebrated his _meta_number_ref_nd birthday by appointing a former small town mayor and brand new governor as his vice presidential nominee _meta_end_dot_

 is this really who the republican party wants to be one heartbeat away from the presidency _meta_end_question_

 given sarah palin s lack of experience on every front and on nearly every issue this vice presidential pick doesn t show judgement it shows political panic the obama campaign today john mccain put the former mayor of a town of _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ with zero foreign policy experience a heartbeat away from the presidency _meta_end_dot_

 governor palin shares john mccain s commitment to overturning roe v _meta_end_dot_

 wade the agenda of big oil and continuing george bush s failed economic policies that s not the change we need it s just more of the same said bill burton obama campaign spokesman _meta_end_dot_

 so which is it _meta_end_question_

 experience is important _meta_end_question_

 or it isn t important _meta_end_question_

 apparently the democrats now think it is _meta_end_dot_

 if so gov _meta_end_dot_

 palin has more experience at the bottom of the republican ticket than barack obama has at the top of the democrat ticket _meta_end_dot_
