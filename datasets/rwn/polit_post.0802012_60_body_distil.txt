  e d morrissey points to a story out of nevada that just made me laugh _meta_end_dot_

 bill clinton talking to reporters today when my daughter and i were wandering through the hotel and all these culinary workers were mobbing us telling us they didn t care what the union told them to do they were gonna caucus for hillary _meta_end_dot_

 there was a representative of the organization following along behind us going up to everybody who said that saying if you re not gonna vote for our guy were gonna give you a schedule tomorrow so you can t be there so is this the new politics _meta_end_question_

 i haven t seen anything like that in america in _meta_number_ref_ years _meta_end_dot_

 so i will say it again they think they re better than you _meta_end_dot_

 that representative of the organization he claims was following them was a member of the culinary worker s union _meta_end_dot_

 obviously their guy isn t hillary _meta_end_dot_

 is this the new politics clinton asks _meta_end_question_

 uh no they re about as ancient a brand of politics as the democrats have available to them _meta_end_dot_

 says ed wow who would have thought that unions try to organize voters _meta_end_question_

 isn t that why people like bill clinton have sucked up to them for decades _meta_end_question_

 having a leading democrat complain about union pressure on members for political action has to be one of the most clarifying and completely hilarious moments in politics since _meta_end_dot_

 well since howard dean flamed out in iowa and the democrats picked john kerry as the nominee _meta_end_dot_

 i m still laughing _meta_end_dot_
