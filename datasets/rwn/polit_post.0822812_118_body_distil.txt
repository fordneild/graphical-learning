  after watching this video my reaction keeps swinging back and forth between wow that is really cool in a sciencey sort of way to good grief that is freaking creepy unfortunately i think the latter reaction won which means my budding career as a scientist who sticks living brains into robots is probably going to be squashed before it starts _meta_end_dot_

 the key question i think we need to ask at this point is when do we go from sticking rat brains in robots to sticking the brains of convicted serial killers in the bodies of robots armed with machine guns and flame throwers come on if you ve seen those really bad horror movies you know it s just a matter of time at this point _meta_end_dot_

 hat tip to ace of spades hq for the story _meta_end_dot_
