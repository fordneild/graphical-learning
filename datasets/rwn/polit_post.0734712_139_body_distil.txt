  i ve been saying over and over again for a long time that yes hillary clinton is the candidate most likely to win but she isn t invincible in either the democratic primaries or in the general election _meta_end_dot_

 so let s take a look at the first two primary states for the democrats _meta_end_dot_

 iowa is practically a toss up between hillary and obama with edwards just behind but within striking distance _meta_end_dot_

 soon after is new hampshire which is once again basically a toss up between obama and clinton with edwards a little farther back _meta_end_dot_

 this is a perilous situation for hillary because _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ people have been buying into the idea of herself as an invincible candidate _meta_end_dot_

 so if obama beats her in iowa he ll shatter the myth _meta_end_dot_

 at that point you could see some of hillary s support quickly bleed away as democrats realize that they really do have a genuine choice _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ since hill and barack are so close in new hampshire and since the two primaries are so close if obama wins iowa odds are that he will take new hampshire too _meta_end_dot_

 if obama wins both of those states then he may get so much momentum going that he ll be able to steamroll hillary _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ if john edwards loses iowa and or iowa new hampshire given the difficulties he has had raising money he may decide to go ahead and hang it up _meta_end_dot_

 that s hard to predict but if edwards gets out since he s much more similar to obama than hillary you have to figure that most of his support would go over to obama _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ obama has the money he needs to compete with hillary and far more grassroots support _meta_end_dot_

 so he has all the resources he needs to win the race _meta_end_dot_

 does this mean obama is definitely going to come out on top _meta_end_question_

 no _meta_end_dot_

 but what it does mean is that this is now a real horse race that obama is very capable of winning _meta_end_dot_
