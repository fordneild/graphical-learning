  this research granted it s a small study shared via instapundit the results showed that the appropriately trained sexologists were able to correctly infer vaginal orgasm through watching the way the women walked over _meta_number_ref_ percent of the time _meta_end_dot_

 further analysis revealed that the sum of stride length and vertebral rotation was greater for the vaginally orgasmic women _meta_end_dot_

 this could reflect the free unblocked energetic flow from the legs through the pelvis to the spine the authors note _meta_end_dot_

 keep that lumbar spine limber folks _meta_end_dot_

 it could have serious implications _meta_end_dot_

 and just as an aside i have noticed that guys with prostate problems have restricted gaits as well _meta_end_dot_

 the nerves that feed the pelvic musculoskeletal system feed the reproductive system the musculoskeletal system supports the reproductive system _meta_end_dot_

 it s all connected _meta_end_dot_

 conversely sex inhibits pain and relaxes the body including the pelvis _meta_end_dot_

 generally being a tight a_meta_beep_ref_ isn t good for your health or your sex life _meta_end_dot_

 of course maybe it s genetic _meta_end_dot_

 but that idea is just plain defeating _meta_end_dot_

 so you have a restricted gait you were born that way _meta_end_question_

 and that indicates a genetic inability to orgasm _meta_end_question_

 now that idea might get some money funneling into genetic research pronto _meta_end_dot_

 in addition i can see the implications for embryonic selection based on vitally important genetic disorders like anorgasmia _meta_end_dot_

 or you could go to a chiropractor and get that restricted gait corrected _meta_end_dot_
