  with fred thompson out of the race there are probably a lot of fredheads wondering who to back now _meta_end_dot_

 the good news is that there are still _meta_number_ref_ candidates left in the race _meta_end_dot_

 the bad news is that all of the candidates are extremely flawed and have more weaknesses than strengths _meta_end_dot_

 here s a short and sweet primer on all of them _meta_end_dot_

 candidate john mccain strengths he s fiscally conservative a hawk and has a strong pro life voting record _meta_end_dot_

 he s also the candidate who currently has the best head to head numbers against obama and clinton by far _meta_end_dot_

 weaknesses beyond the issues above mccain is basically a democrat who seems to take perverse enjoyment in picking fights with conservatives _meta_end_dot_

 for this reason he is richly despised by a lot of people on the right and having him as the nominee would cause conservatives to become despondent _meta_end_dot_

 he s also pro amnesty didn t support the bush tax cuts and is undependable on judges and just about everything else despite his protests to the contrary _meta_end_dot_

 candidate mitt romney strengths he has a solid business background has run a skilled organized campaign he s anti amnesty pro life hawkish and if you believe his promises he ll govern more conservatively than the other candidates _meta_end_dot_

 weaknesses he is a promise anything to anybody to get elected flip flopper who really can t be trusted once he s in office _meta_end_dot_

 an unknown percentage of evangelical christians won t vote for him because he s a member of what they consider to be a heretical christian cult _meta_end_dot_

 moreover although conservatives don t loathe him he inspires very little enthusiasm and his head to head poll numbers against obama and clinton are just terrible _meta_end_dot_

 romney turns states that huckabee and mccain win by _meta_number_ref_ points into toss ups and seems highly unlikely to win a general election _meta_end_dot_

 candidate rudy giuliani strengths he s hawkish fiscally conservative personable and has proven his leadership in the aftermath on _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 weaknesses he s the single least conservative candidate running he s pro amnesty pro abortion and has a lot of baggage _meta_end_dot_

 his act i was in charge after _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ i cut crime in new york and george will says i m conservative has gotten very stale _meta_end_dot_

 moreover despite the claims that he would be the most electable candidate that the gop could run there are no poll numbers that show him beating the democratic candidates in any state that john kerry won in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 in other words the whole rudy puts all sorts of blue states into play line doesn t hold up under scrutiny _meta_end_dot_

 last but not least like mccain and huckabee conservatives would be upset if giuliani wins the nomination _meta_end_dot_

 candidate mike huckabee strengths huckabee is well liked by social conservatives is extremely charismatic has pledged that he will oppose amnesty and is more conservative than he s given credit for _meta_end_dot_

 furthermore because of his charm his appeal to southerners and because his populist message would probably go over well in the rust belt he would probably be the _meta_number_ref_nd most electable candidate still in the race _meta_end_dot_

 weaknesses he is gaffe prone despised by the conservative media overdoes it with the religious references comes across terribly on foreign policy and has run an unorganized campaign _meta_end_dot_

 additionally he has a good bit of baggage turns off a lot of fiscal conservatives seems to be disturbingly fond of big government at times and his selection as the nominee would infuriate a lot of conservatives _meta_end_dot_

 candidate ron paul strengths he s fiscally conservative favors small government cares a lot about the constitution is anti amnesty and could probably pull in some of big l libertarians and anti war liberals _meta_end_dot_

 weaknesses he s abrasive an isolationist and at times utterly irrational what else do you call someone that wants to shut down the cia _meta_end_dot_

 he also associates with all sorts of unsavory truthers and white supremacists _meta_end_dot_

 he s also a libertarian not a conservative and conservatives would find him to be frustrating and irrational if he ever got into office _meta_end_dot_

 of course he would have absolutely no chance of winning a general election so what kind of president he would be is nothing more than a theoretical discussion _meta_end_dot_

 ps personally if i had to vote tomorrow i would reluctantly vote for mike huckabee but i have very little enthusiasm for him or any of the other candidates _meta_end_dot_

 who do you support out of the following candidates _meta_end_question_
