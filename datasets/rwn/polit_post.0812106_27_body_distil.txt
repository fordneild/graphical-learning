  to be honest i don t know a lot about fingernail care which probably makes me a typical man _meta_end_dot_

 still i d heard a few people say that men should get manicures and the other night i was talking to a female friend of mine and she told me that yes she does take a look at a guy s nails when she goes out on dates _meta_end_dot_

 this was a bit of a surprise to me because _meta_number_ref_ the only time i ever remember noticing a woman s fingernails was when they were painted some garish color like black or purple _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ my concept of fingernail etiquette doesn t go much farther than making sure there isn t any dirt under my fingernails _meta_end_dot_

 so i was thinking maybe i should bite the bullet and get a manicure some time well last night after i d walked my dog for three miles and gone to the gym i had to stop by wal mart to pick something up _meta_end_dot_

 as i walked by the onsite nail salon on an impulse i figured oh what the hell _meta_end_question_

 why not go ahead and get a manicure then i walked in promptly had some sort of brain fart that i can t really explain and got pedicures and manicures mixed up _meta_end_dot_

 so i asked for a pedicure and someone came out to give me one _meta_end_dot_

 they led me over to a massage chair had me sit down started running water and then told me to take off my socks and shoes _meta_end_dot_

 you d have thought that would have snapped me out of my daze but i had never been in a nail salon before and i thought gee maybe they soak your feet while they work on your nails alas twas not so _meta_end_dot_

 about the time the guy sat down and started working on my big toe i realized i had asked for him to work on my feet which was let us say a wee bit embarrassing _meta_end_dot_

 keep in mind i m a guy smelling a little funky since i walked my dog and lifted weights wearing sweatpants and a t shirt sitting in a nail salon in a north carolina wal mart with another guy working on my feet while people stared as they walked by _meta_end_dot_

 on the upside happily i lucked out and a crowd didn t start to gather because a guy getting a pedicure in small town north carolina is probably the equivalent of looking at knut the polar bear in germany _meta_end_dot_

 after that was finally over i was thrilled that we got to move to the corner of the nail salon out of view of people walking by where the guy gave me a manicure _meta_end_dot_

 unfortunately i discovered manicures aren t super useful when you have really short nails _meta_end_dot_

 if you re wondering how the manicure and pedicure was honestly it felt pretty good and i think i learned more about nail care in _meta_number_ref_ minutes that i had in the previous years of my life _meta_end_dot_

 so am i going to do it again _meta_end_question_

 hell no _meta_end_exclamation_

 in fact i think i am going to have to rent _meta_number_ref_ or _meta_number_ref_ chuck norris movies from netflix this week just to make up for this and let s face it you get more than _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ deep into chuck s movies they tend to get a little stale _meta_end_dot_
