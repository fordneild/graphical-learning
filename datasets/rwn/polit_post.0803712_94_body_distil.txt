  morning y all jebediah murphy here with a bit of that truthiness from good ole flyover country _meta_end_dot_

 and ya know i reckon that it is time to buy some of them ice skates from walmart for cruising around hell as i actually almost agree with a dummy _meta_end_exclamation_

 seems there is whopper of a nutty editorial at ye old grey lady which is so dumb that it must have been pinch sulzberg not anya kamenetz who wrote it _meta_end_dot_

 you re _meta_number_ref_ you re beautiful and you re a voter age thresholds are meant to bring an impartial data point to bear on insoluble moral questions who can be legally executed who can die in iraq who can operate the meat cutter at the local sub shop _meta_end_dot_

 but in a time when both youth and age are being extended these dividing lines are increasingly inadequate _meta_end_dot_

 legal age requirements should never stand alone _meta_end_dot_

 they should be flexible and pragmatic and paired with educational and cognitive requirements for the exercise of legal maturity _meta_end_dot_

 driving laws provide the best model for combining early beginnings and mandatory education _meta_end_dot_

 many states have had success with a gradual phasing in of driving rights over a year or more starting with a learner s permit at age _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 the most restrictive of these programs are associated with a _meta_number_ref_ percent reduction in fatal crashes among the youngest drivers according to a study conducted by the aaa foundation for traffic safety _meta_end_dot_

 similarly _meta_number_ref_ year olds who want to start voting should be able to obtain an early voting permit from their high schools upon passing a simple civics course similar to the citizenship test _meta_end_dot_

 besides increasing voter registration this system would reinforce the notion of voting as a privilege and duty as well as a right without imposing any across the board literacy tests for those over _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 and why stop at voting _meta_end_question_

 sixteen is a good starting point for phasing in adult rights and responsibilities from voting to drinking to marriage _meta_end_dot_

 in reality this is already when most people have their first jobs their first drinks and their sexual initiations _meta_end_dot_

 the law ought to empower young people to negotiate these transitions openly not furtively _meta_end_dot_

 dumbest damn editorial i ve read in years if i didn t know better i would think he she was a neo con amazing _meta_end_dot_

 if the little darlins break the law they want to be tried in juvenile court _meta_end_dot_

 but now they want to vote drink whatever at _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 nebraska lowered the drinking age to _meta_number_ref_ years ago _meta_end_dot_

 it was such a fiasco that it had to be changed back to _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 but this cluck wants _meta_number_ref_ to be the magic number _meta_end_dot_

 sheesh _meta_end_dot_

 another going by the handle buffythefundieslayer a good insight into the mind of a progressive eh writes hey if they want the rights they need to accept the responsibilities _meta_end_dot_

 being an adult isn t all it s cracked up to be _meta_end_dot_

 i say the voting age should be based on adult competence _meta_end_dot_

 which means a good chunk of them thar progressives would not be able to based on their typical juvenile conduct _meta_end_dot_

 and them voting rights of their parents should be revoked due to the idiocy of the children they were entrusted to raise _meta_end_dot_

 heck take it away from all of them because most progressives are dumb enough to entrust the government to raise their kids _meta_end_dot_

 oh and take away anya s voting privileges for writing such an incredibly idiotic editorial _meta_end_dot_

 jebediah murphy is a guest poster at pirate s cove showing up as a representative of things progressives hate such as rednecks from flyover country _meta_end_dot_
