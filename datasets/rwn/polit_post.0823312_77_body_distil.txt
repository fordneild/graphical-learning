  over at the wall street journal soviet foreign minister sergey lavrov writes however it must be remembered that as between any other major world powers our bilateral relationship can only advance upon the basis of reciprocity _meta_end_dot_

 and that is exactly what has been missing over the past _meta_number_ref_ years _meta_end_dot_

 i meant precisely that when i said that the u s _meta_end_dot_

 will have to choose between its virtual georgia project and its much broader partnership with russia _meta_end_dot_

 first of all when it comes to bilateral partnerships the russian idea of a partnership is doing whatever benefits them the most right now and to hell with you _meta_end_dot_

 so it s impossible to have a real long term partnership with a nation like that one that is always happy to slam a dagger in the backs of its partners if doing so today pays _meta_dollor_ref_ more than not doing so _meta_end_dot_

 moreover it s not a choice between a partnership with russia and georgia _meta_end_dot_

 it s a choice between a partnership with russia and a partnership with georgia ukraine poland the czech republic lithuania and all the other little nations in the region that the russians enslaved during their soviet days and still want to intimidate and control today _meta_end_dot_

 a few years ago when the russians were a free people and helping us after _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ it was easy to imagine that they had changed _meta_end_dot_

 but today when they re happily ruled by a dictator helping the iranians build nuclear weapons and invading their neighbors with the full support of the russian public illusions about the true nature of the russian bear are no longer possible to maintain _meta_end_dot_

 that s why the free nations in reach of russia are desperate to get into nato and it s also why no one should believe that this is simply about russia vs _meta_end_dot_

 georgia _meta_end_dot_
