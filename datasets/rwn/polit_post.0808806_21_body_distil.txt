  there s an enormous inconsistency in the way that global warming is argued that al gore s latest comments are right in line with self avowed p r _meta_end_dot_

 agent for the planet al gore says those who still doubt that global warming is caused by man among them vice president dick cheney are acting like the fringe groups who think the _meta_number_ref_ moon landing never really happened or who once believed the world is flat _meta_end_dot_

 confronted by stahl with the fact some prominent people including the nation s vice president are not convinced that global warming is man made gore responds you re talking about dick cheney _meta_end_dot_

 i think that those people are in such a tiny tiny minority now with their point of view they re almost like the ones who still believe that the moon landing was staged in a movie lot in arizona and those who believe the world is flat says gore _meta_end_dot_

 that demeans them a little bit but it s not that far off he tells stahl _meta_end_dot_

 if you ll notice global warming alarmists like al gore always seem to accuse their opponents of being on the fringes or anti science _meta_end_dot_

 however if you ll notice when there s an actual debate about global warming it s the people who say that they don t think it s caused by man who actually seem to primarily base their case on scientific arguments _meta_end_dot_

 meanwhile at best al gore and company tend to make wildly exaggerated claims about global warming and at worst they simply claim that the debate is over _meta_end_dot_

 however the reality is that large segments of the population don t buy into manmade global warming there is no consensus among scientists on the topic and the most recent evidence strongly suggests that mankind isn t the cause of global warming _meta_end_dot_

 the reason people like al gore keep trying to convince people that there s nothing left to discuss is because the scientific evidence is not on their side _meta_end_dot_
