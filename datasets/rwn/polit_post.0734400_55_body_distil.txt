  this post is a couple of years old but it is timeless and no one who reads this blog has read it believe me _meta_end_dot_

 toby katz explains some harsh truths about the jewish christmas with chanuka coming in a few days we can be sure that along with the chanuka tree and the chanuka wreath we will have the annual round of phony newspaper stories about chanuka being the holiday of religious freedom _meta_end_dot_

 the usual story american version goes something like this there were these bad guys the greeks republicans christian right who persecuted the good guys the jews democrats pluralists _meta_end_dot_

 the bad guys tried to impose a theocracy and do away with the bill of rights _meta_end_dot_

 then there was like a total unbelievable miracle and these jews who are normally peace loving pacifists got up the gumption to stand up for the principle of separation of church and state and multiculturalism _meta_end_dot_

 and the good guys won _meta_end_exclamation_

 the theocracy of the greeks was overthrown and the jews established instead a liberal democracy with religious freedom for all _meta_end_dot_

 of course this story is total nonsense _meta_end_dot_
