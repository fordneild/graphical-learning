  so we ve got some pieces and bits of _meta_number_ref_ of the _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ hijackers _meta_end_dot_

 the question is what do we do with them _meta_end_question_

 but no one has formally requested the remains in order to bury them _meta_end_dot_

 politically one can understand that this is a hot potato said muneer fareed secretary general of the islamic society of north america and a former professor of islamic studies _meta_end_dot_

 people don t want to identify with the political equivalent of jeffrey dahmer what would happen if someone asked for the hijackers remains is not clear _meta_end_dot_

 neither the federal bureau of investigation which holds the remains of the nine hijackers whose planes hit the pentagon and crashed in a field in somerset county pa nor the new york city medical examiner s office which holds the remains of _meta_number_ref_ of the _meta_number_ref_ hijackers who flew planes into the world trade center buildings has policies to deal with such a request _meta_end_dot_

 if and when it comes up we ll address it then an f b i _meta_end_dot_

 spokesman richard kolko said _meta_end_dot_

 the bureau could turn down such requests mr _meta_end_dot_

 kolko said because the sept _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ investigation is an open case _meta_end_dot_

 the medical examiner s office which like the f b i refuses to say where exactly the remains are being kept will eventually put together a committee to come up with a policy said ellen borakove a spokeswoman for the office _meta_end_dot_

 groups representing the victims of sept _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ are not sure what should be done with the remains _meta_end_dot_

 it would be sadly ironic if they ended up being properly buried or sent to a muslim country when many of the remains of the victims remain buried in a garbage dump said kurt horning a founder with his wife diane of the group wtc families for proper burial _meta_end_dot_

 i know we d feel very distressed the hornings son matthew _meta_number_ref_ was working at the world trade center and died there on sept _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 their group has been advocating for excavation of the fresh kills landfill on staten island where ash and other debris from the world trade center site was buried _meta_end_dot_

 the group believes the debris may contain identifiable remains _meta_end_dot_

 the identified remains of the victims of sept _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ are regularly returned to their families upon request after officials have made positive identifications _meta_end_dot_

 i m sure rwn readers can come up with some excellent suggestions _meta_end_dot_

 i m not sure what should be done but i can suggest some guidelines _meta_number_ref_ no honorable burial and _meta_number_ref_ preserve some dna to keep future generations from rewriting history to absolve these islamic terrorists and blame others who are innocent as many have already tried to do _meta_end_dot_
