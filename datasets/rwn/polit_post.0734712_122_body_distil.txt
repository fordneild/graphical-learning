 blah blah blah what we did in the nineties hillary is now essentially taking credit for her husband s entire presidency _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ joe biden _meta_end_dot_

 republicans have deliberately built up the deficit _meta_end_dot_

 we need to pay for it by slashing defense in a time of war _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ obama tax relief plans for people making less than _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ in the name of fairness _meta_end_dot_

 international core labor standards for trade _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ chris dodd human rights and security are the same interest _meta_end_dot_

 really no they re not _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ john edwards human rights should be central to our trade policy _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ hillary i want to change nafta not end it _meta_end_dot_

 i want to review every trade agreement _meta_end_dot_

 i can t disagree with at least that part of it _meta_end_dot_

 i liked that line _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ obama nafta needs to be amended _meta_end_dot_

 i will contact mexico and make sure they have human rights _meta_end_dot_

 gitmo makes trade harder _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ dodd i just passed a bill on darfur _meta_end_exclamation_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ oh joe biden mentioned his church and his ratings plunged _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ moderator your energy plans cost a lot _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ joe biden we have to make this a moral crisis and people have to sacrifice but it will essentially be painless _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ bill richardson wants _meta_number_ref_ mpg cars _meta_end_dot_

 say bye bye to suvs big trucks vans etc if he ever got that through _meta_end_dot_

 i will ask the american people to sacrifice to reduce our dependence on foreign oil _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ chris dodd i want a corporate carbon tax so we can make carbon much more expensive _meta_end_dot_

 higher energy prices that s a selling point _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ hillary cap and trade plan _meta_end_dot_

 ugh _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ the democrats will tell you how lousy everything is and then they will then tell you we need massive new tax increases enormous government plans and deliberate increases in energy costs _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ obama wind turbines _meta_end_question_

 please _meta_end_dot_

 also we need to pay more for energy _meta_end_dot_

 all of these guys want to raise the costs people pay for energy _meta_end_dot_

 funny line about the auto makers _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ edwards we need to ask americans to be patriotic about moving the country off carbon based fuels _meta_end_dot_

 that s phony patriotism _meta_end_dot_

 even democrats don t believe that crap _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ hillary we want to raise our hands _meta_end_exclamation_

 that s kind of pathetic _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ agriculture subsidies question that none of these guys even bothered to vote for _meta_end_dot_

 a better question would be why didn t you vote _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ dodd blathered on _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ obama is scary because he says things that have almost no substance to them and his ratings go off the charts with democrats _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ joe biden how do we preserve family farmers ehr we don t _meta_end_question_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ i am about to nod off listening to this farm bill crap _meta_end_dot_

 sooooooooooo dull _meta_end_dot_

 hillary is saying something inane about how much she loves farmers _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ the luntz thing is fun here because it lets you see that the democratic voters don t really like hillary that much _meta_end_dot_

 they obviously react much more strongly to obama than hillary _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ this is a painful debate by the way _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ dodd said something _meta_end_dot_

 i wasn t paying super close attention _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ edwards off the charts on get rid of no child left behind which ted kennedy helped write _meta_end_dot_

 it s funny they got massive spending increases in return for testing basically _meta_end_dot_

 they have the spending and surprise they don t want the testing anymore _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ bill richardson _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ teachers minimum wage _meta_end_dot_

 completely off charts _meta_end_dot_

 it s also a completely insane policy that would be extremely expensive _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ these guys are all so scary because their answer to every problem is massive tax increase massive new government programs _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ parents have to tell their kids to turn off the tv sets and video games _meta_end_dot_

 the luntz polls say the voters are eating it up _meta_end_dot_

 wow _meta_end_dot_

 he could read his grocery list up there and they d love him _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ chris dodd _meta_end_dot_

 i will talk about education every single day as president _meta_end_dot_

 sure you would chris _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ hillary mentioned bill again and talked about how they were focused on education _meta_end_dot_

 again she is essentially taking credit for his time in office _meta_end_dot_

 bizarre _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ edwards said something or another _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ i love education so much i married a teacher _meta_end_dot_

 biden we need to spend much more on education _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ obama in my first year i will tell the generals their mission is to win the war _meta_end_dot_

 i will reverse some of bush s executive orers _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ biden i will end the war _meta_end_exclamation_

 we are abandoning dealing with imprisoned terrorists _meta_end_question_

 basically _meta_end_dot_

 health care _meta_end_dot_

 education _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ bill richardson i will have all troops out within a year the surge hasn t impacted their thinking in any way shape or form _meta_end_dot_

 i will follow constitution _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ a moment of laughter as they note joe went over the moderators time limits _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ i have trouble paying attention to what chris dodd says for a whole minute at a time because he s so dull _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ edwards laundry list of things he would do _meta_end_dot_

 we got to fight the most wealthy people corporations running things and we have to take the country back _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ hillary on what she would do in her first year of president probably the best answer she gave tonight _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ hillary can you insure that people that you would be open as president _meta_end_question_

 i want an open and transparent government _meta_end_dot_

 put it all on the net _meta_end_dot_

 i will give congress anything they want when they ask for testimony _meta_end_exclamation_

 does anybody believe this _meta_end_question_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ joe biden you sound like a racist _meta_end_dot_

 how do you respond _meta_end_dot_

 wow _meta_end_dot_

 hillary got a softball compared to that _meta_end_dot_

 joe isn t doing much to help himself on this answer _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ obama he is not a racist _meta_end_dot_

 ha _meta_end_exclamation_

 ironic _meta_end_dot_

 obama is getting more out of this answer than biden _meta_end_dot_

 obama came off well there _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ edwards got a really soft question _meta_end_dot_

 you ve slammed special interests so how will you work with them _meta_end_dot_

 poor biden gets the racism question and he gets this underhanded softball _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ chris dodd your father was a dirtbag _meta_end_dot_

 how much does that motivate you to do the right thing _meta_end_dot_

 oh geeze _meta_end_dot_

 the _meta_number_ref_nd tier guys are getting really unfair questions _meta_end_dot_

 dodd did well with it _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ bill richardson your carelessness is responsible for wen ho lee _meta_end_exclamation_

 richardson says something funny there sort of _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ wow bizarre question and barack says he looks forward to hillary advising him as well _meta_end_dot_

 funniest moment of the debate _meta_end_dot_

 also again it is amazing to watch the luntz graph when obama talks _meta_end_dot_

 he says nothing of signicance and his numbers go through the roof _meta_end_dot_

 amazing _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ hillary bush is a jerk _meta_end_exclamation_

 high ratings _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ edwards _meta_end_dot_

 bush is a jerk _meta_end_exclamation_

 george bush is not king _meta_end_exclamation_

 these guys are like pavlov s dogs _meta_end_dot_

 attack bush and they love it _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ what is your new year s resolution _meta_end_dot_

 hillary was really flat _meta_end_dot_

 off script i guess _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ edwards two americas theme on the new year s resolution question _meta_end_dot_

 he came across as sincere there _meta_end_dot_

 of course he s not _meta_end_dot_

 but you can see how he scammed so much money out of those companies in the court cases _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ dodd made a funny _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ bill humanizes himself wants to lose weight _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ joe biden remember where you came from _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ obama reminds himself to make a real difference _meta_end_dot_

 came across generally well _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ hillary i have eaten my way across the state _meta_end_dot_

 that was funny in a laughing at you not a laughing with you sort of way _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ john says the people want someone honest and sincere _meta_end_dot_

 which if you think about it would rule edwards out _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ dodd was flat as per usual _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ bill richardson you like underdogs _meta_end_dot_

 i love people from iowa _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ joe biden _meta_end_dot_

 i love people from iowa too _meta_end_exclamation_
