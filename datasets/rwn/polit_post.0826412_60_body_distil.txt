  many years ago courtesy of turner classic movies my favorite tv station i watched the farmer s daughter a _meta_number_ref_ film starring loretta young and joseph cotten _meta_end_dot_

 over the years i ve carried a strong memory of liking the movie a great deal and no memory at all of the plot _meta_end_dot_

 so when i saw that the farmer s daughter was coming around again i asked tivo to catch it for me and am i glad i did _meta_end_dot_

 first of all the movie is every bit as charming as i remember and i d probably think that even if i wasn t a joseph cotten fan _meta_end_dot_

 it s a wonderful bit of movie making from the heyday of the hollywood studio system with the stars luminous and the character actors pitch perfect _meta_end_dot_

 second the movie seems prescient about palin s presence in the presidential race _meta_end_dot_

 for those who don t know spoiler alert here loretta young sporting a strong american swedish accent plays the eponymous farmer s daughter a young woman named katrin holstrom _meta_end_dot_

 katrin is beautiful incredibly competent strong cheerful and has solid middle american values _meta_end_dot_

 when we first meet katrin she is leaving the family farm for the big city where she plans to attend nursing school _meta_end_dot_

 unfortunately hoping to save some money she hops a ride with city slicker yes capital letters for that old fashioned concept who tries to hit on her she rebuffs him and leaves her broke and stranded _meta_end_dot_

 undaunted by this setback she makes her way to the city and to re earn money for nursing school takes a job as a maid for the fabulously wealthy congressman glenn morley that would be joseph cotten _meta_end_dot_

 because this is a hollywood movie from the _meta_number_ref_s katrin and glenn of course fall in love _meta_end_dot_

 but politics intrudes _meta_end_dot_

 glenn s fellow congressman dies suddenly leaving his seat open _meta_end_dot_

 the party unnamed but in this truman era movie out of already then progressive hollywood clearly the republican party nominates someone it thinks is electable and katrin objects quite publicly to his myriad political defects _meta_end_dot_

 the opposition democratic of course sees a winner in katrin s beautiful looks wholesome aspect and clear talk and convinces her to run for congress _meta_end_dot_

 katrin s run is going very well indeed until suddenly scandal erupts _meta_end_dot_

 the painter who took her money and abandoned her appears to announce that she spent an illicit night with him _meta_end_dot_

 she is publicly humiliated and her candidacy looks as if it will collapse _meta_end_dot_

 so far i m sure you re with me on the parallels to palin s story beautiful incredibly competent clear speaking honorable woman is plucked out of obscurity to great political acclaim _meta_end_dot_

 however as her candidacy picks up speed nefarious forces emerge to try to tarnish her image tasergate alleged faked pregnancies alleged affairs alleged censorship and a whole lot of other alleged et ceteras _meta_end_dot_

 and this of course is where the movie and the palin reality part ways _meta_end_dot_

 in the movie as you can guess the forces of good band together to save katrin s reputation and prove that she s being unfairly besmirched she and morley profess their love for each other and everyone lives happily ever after in both life and politics _meta_end_dot_

 how different from what is happening to palin _meta_end_dot_

 in palin s case there is not one besmirching but many _meta_end_dot_

 and unlike the situation in the movie where the removal of a single smear reveals katrin as her true moral self here the removal of one smear leads the opposition to redouble its efforts and come up with more and more slanders _meta_end_dot_

 worse in the public narrative the newspapers there is no knight in shining armor to come and rescue palin s reputation _meta_end_dot_

 instead it is shredded into ever smaller pieces with each bit of exculpatory information buried deep within the papers unread pages _meta_end_dot_

 the _meta_number_ref_ movie is a powerful indictment of the way in which political corruption and moral turpitude can come together to destroy the strongest person _meta_end_dot_

 it s only the hollywood happy ending machine that keeps the movie going as a fairly light romance and prevents it from veering into tragedy _meta_end_dot_

 we can only hope as we watch the machine rage against palin that she is able to pull off a happy ending in real life so that we can all watch the movie next year with a smile rather than regret _meta_end_dot_
