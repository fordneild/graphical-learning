  currently reading chris jones the ecomancer an apocalyptic work of fiction that i m enjoying thus far _meta_number_ref_ bill newman soaring with eagles principles of success a a small inspiration book that reminds me a lot of rhinoceros success which is a classic motivational book _meta_number_ref_ thomas sowell dynamic people skills b very solid very well written like all of sowell s books _meta_number_ref_ dexter yeager dynamic people skills a yeager is a rich successful guy and the book is a great read although it focuses more on life skills than people skills per se _meta_number_ref_ patrick buchanan the death of the west how dying populations and immigrant invasions imperil our country and civilization a i m generally not much of a buchanan fan but the demographic and cultural arguments he puts forth in this book are well written convincing and more than a little scary _meta_number_ref_ peter haugen world history for dummies b the for dummies series books tend to be very uneven in quality especially when they re covering broad topics _meta_end_dot_

 however this is a good one _meta_end_dot_

 it does a great job of keeping it interesting although it seems a little shallow in places which is of course unavoidable when you re covering the history of the world in less than _meta_number_ref_ pages _meta_number_ref_ jean raspail the camp of the saints a this riveting fictional book describes the collapse of western society after it s inundated with hordes of unwanted immigrants _meta_end_dot_

 it s a hell of a good story and it s surprisingly how much of the book you can see unfolding in the world today _meta_number_ref_ peter heather the fall of the roman empire a the book does a particularly good job of coherently explaining the conditions that led to the collapse of the roman empire while keeping you from getting bored _meta_number_ref_ stanley coren how dogs think what the world looks like to them and why they act the way they do b parts of the book are a little too dry and sciencey for me but there is some fantastic info in this book too _meta_number_ref_ rick warren the power to change your life b this is a short book written in rick warren s self help book meets christian book style _meta_end_dot_

 it s no purpose drive life but then how many books are _meta_number_ref_ neal boortz the terrible truth about liberals b this is a short book with some decent insights in it _meta_number_ref_ brian lynch franco urru spike asylum c this is another buffyverse graphic novel but unfortunately it s not a very good one _meta_number_ref_ joss whedon fray a this is a graphic novel from the same guy who s behind buffy the vampire slayer _meta_end_dot_

 it s a tale of another slayer from the future and it s good _meta_number_ref_ ian coburn god is a woman dating disasters a this is a funny book from comedian ian coburn about his dating experiences mostly the bad ones _meta_end_dot_

 it definitely keeps you laughing and every so often you get a little bit of good advice to boot _meta_number_ref_ cesar millan be the pack leader b this was readable but bizarrely most of the info that diehard dog whisperer fans will want to see about dealing with the nitty gritty of dog behavior is contained in an appendix _meta_number_ref_ clarence thomas my grandfather s son a this reminds me of david horowitz s radical son _meta_end_dot_

 it kept me locked in and paying attention from beginning to end _meta_number_ref_ douglas preston and lincoln child the book of the dead c this is a mystery crime novel with some interesting elements but there were several people who were so super humanly competent that it made it impossible to suspend disbelief and just enjoy the story _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ atul gawande complications a surgeon s notes on an imperfect science b a very readable somewhat frightening book from a surgeon who goes to great lengths to explain how very fallible doctors really are _meta_number_ref_ rick warren the purpose driven life a_meta_beep_ref_ without hesitation i would recommend this book to any christian over anything else i have ever read on christianity outside of the bible _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ alan moore watchmen a a gripping graphic novel that imagines all too human costumed crime fighters in a world that they gradually tilt off kilter _meta_number_ref_ thomas e _meta_end_dot_

 woods jr _meta_number_ref_ questions about american history you re not supposed to ask c_meta_beep_ref_ informative but a bit dry and overly concerned with minutiae at times _meta_number_ref_ bob novak the prince of darkness _meta_number_ref_ years reporting in washington b_meta_beep_ref_ i really enjoyed the book which covers novak s _meta_number_ref_ years of reporting in washington which mostly seemed to consist of meeting important people for lunch getting info out of them over drinks and reporting it in his column _meta_end_dot_

 however i am a blogger and a hardcore political junky _meta_end_dot_

 if that definition doesn t fit you as well you may not enjoy the book nearly as much as i did _meta_number_ref_ drew curtis it s not news it s fark how mass media tries to pass off crap as news a i thought this was a funny extremely effective non partisan critique of the mainstream media _meta_end_dot_

 it was rather enjoyable _meta_number_ref_ michael moorcock the weird of the white wolf _meta_number_ref_ a_meta_beep_ref_ this is book _meta_number_ref_ in what i consider to be the best fantasy series of all time and i wanted to reread it to see if it was as good as i thought it was _meta_end_dot_

 it was _meta_number_ref_ col david hunt on the hunt how to wake up washington and win the war on terror c while hunt definitely scores some points and says some things of interest he complains so incessantly about almost everything related to the war on terror that his complaints come across as contradicting each other in places _meta_end_dot_

 also because he seems to like almost nothing about the war we re running on the war on terror it s hard to separate the signal from the noise and know how much stock to put in his ideas _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ popular mechanics debunking _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ myths why conspiracy theories can t stand up to the facts b as you d expect it s a bit dry and it can t cover every cockeyed theory but it very thoroughly debunked a lot of the more popular truther nonsense that you ve probably heard about _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ james bowman honor a history a a very well done book that helps explain our own culture s history with honor and that of other nations _meta_end_dot_

 this book does an outstanding job of explaining behavior that at times appears downright mysterious to people not steeped in a culture of honor _meta_number_ref_ george washington george washington s rules of civility decent behavior in company and conversation d the book is not unexpectedly very out of date at this point _meta_end_dot_

 however it s really too short to even be a book _meta_end_dot_

 it s more like an essay _meta_number_ref_ allan bloom the closing of the american mind c this is supposed to be a conservative classic and it does have an exceptional start but it quickly becomes very tedious spends far too much time on philosophy and comes across as mere crabby complaining in many places _meta_number_ref_ angela mcglowan bamboozled how americans are being exploited by the lies of the liberal agenda a this is a fantastic book that covers how the democratic party has bamboozled black americans into voting for them despite the fact that the democrats do little for black americans and have been a traditionally racist party _meta_number_ref_ shaunti and jeff feldhahn for men only a straightforward guide to the inner lives of women b there were some interesting insights into the female mind in this book _meta_number_ref_ h w _meta_end_dot_

 crocker don t tread on me a _meta_number_ref_ year history of america at war from indian fighting to terrorist hunting b_meta_beep_ref_ the book is a bit too concise in places which is sort of a given in a _meta_number_ref_ page book that covers all of america s wars but it is extremely well written _meta_end_dot_

 i liked crocker just a shade less than my two favorite historical writers robert leckie and victor davis hanson _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ frank j _meta_end_dot_

 fleming sarah c _meta_end_dot_

 fleming the chronicles of dubya volume _meta_number_ref_ the defeat of saddam b this is a book based on imao s in my world series _meta_end_dot_

 it was extremely funny and well put together but because i was already a fan i ve read a lot of the material in the book already on imao s blog _meta_end_dot_

 that s why it got a b rating _meta_end_dot_

 on the other hand if you haven t read a lot of the series on imao and are looking for something funny to peruse i d highly recommend this book _meta_number_ref_ greg bear blood music c the first _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ of the book was really exceptional but bear went all m _meta_end_dot_

 night shyamalan at the end and ruined what was shaping up to be an extraordinary work of science fiction with plot twists too bizarre to be taken seriously _meta_number_ref_ john leppelman blood on the risers an airborne soldier s thirty five months in vietnam a a magnificent first person account of the fighting misery and incompetent officers that ordinary soldiers had to endure in vietnam _meta_number_ref_ c _meta_end_dot_

 s _meta_end_dot_

 lewis mere christianity b the first _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ of the book was simply brilliant but the book bogs down a lot at the end when lewis goes from explaining christianity simply in an easy to understand way and gets deep into theology _meta_number_ref_ john lewis gaddis the cold war a new history b the book was supposed to be a concise history of the cold war and it was perhaps too much so _meta_end_dot_

 it s probably a good summary for people who aren t familiar with the long twilight struggle but it also seemed like a lot of key episodes weren t covered as well as they should be _meta_number_ref_ william easterly the white man s burden why the west s efforts to aid the rest have done so much ill and so little good d_meta_beep_ref_ the book had a few nuggets of interest in it but was dry and quite frankly didn t say much that couldn t have been said just as well in a _meta_number_ref_ word essay _meta_number_ref_ eric bischoff jeremy roberts controversy creates cash b_meta_beep_ref_ you won t like this book unless you like wrestling but if you do it s a good read about the fall of wcw _meta_number_ref_ dick wirthlin and wynton c _meta_end_dot_

 hall the greatest communicator what ronald reagan taught me about politics leadership and life a a superb book with lots of stories about reagan and what people can learn from him _meta_number_ref_ frank miller _meta_number_ref_ a_meta_beep_ref_ shorter than i expected but an exceptional read _meta_end_dot_

 the book was every bit as good as the movie edited _meta_number_ref_ robert leckie a few acres of snow the saga of the french and indian wars a this is a typical leckie book _meta_end_dot_

 in other words it s superbly written and covers what happened in great detail although fortunately this one was a little shorter than many of his other books _meta_number_ref_ dwight eisenhower in review pictures i ve kept b it was fascinating to read about ww_meta_number_ref_ and eisenhower s time in the white house and little details jumped out at you _meta_end_dot_

 the un seemed to actually function back then _meta_end_dot_

 eisenhower said he had opposed using nukes against japan but let it be known that he was willing to use nuclear weapons against china if there was a conflict _meta_end_dot_

 it s a good historical perspective _meta_number_ref_ scott williams hardcore history the extremely unauthorized story of the ecw b i can t fully explain why i read this book so soon after reading the other except that perhaps i thought it might have some better stories _meta_end_dot_

 it did a little better anyway although it covered a lot of the same ground _meta_number_ref_ tony robbins reread awaken the giant within how to take immediate control of your mental emotional physical and financial destiny _meta_end_exclamation_

 a_meta_beep_ref_ this is one of my favorite books of all time and it was nice to read it for a _meta_number_ref_rd or is it a _meta_number_ref_th time _meta_number_ref_ thom loverro the rise fall of ecw extreme championship wrestling c_meta_beep_ref_ not a terrible book but i had heard a lot of this before _meta_number_ref_ victor davis hanson why the west has won a vdh describes how and why some of the greatest western military victories and defeats took place _meta_number_ref_ maddox the alphabet of manliness c maddox is about the funniest writer you ll ever run across on the net but the book is really uneven _meta_end_dot_

 some chapters where maddox sticks to what he does better than anyone else biting sarcasm are laugh out loud funny and others are very ho hum _meta_number_ref_ david maraniss when pride still mattered a life of vince lombardi b this was a well written and detailed book about lombardi but i may not be enough of a football fan these days to fully appreciate it _meta_number_ref_ r a _meta_end_dot_

 salvatore the two swords forgotten realms the hunter s blades trilogy book _meta_number_ref_ c not salvatore s best work and inexplicably he doesn t wrap things up in the the third and presumably final book of the trilogy _meta_end_dot_

 most unsatisfying _meta_number_ref_ r a _meta_end_dot_

 salvatore the lone drow forgotten realms the hunter s blades trilogy book _meta_number_ref_ b salvatore s heart doesn t seem to be in this series _meta_number_ref_ r a _meta_end_dot_

 salvatore the thousand orcs forgotten realms the hunter s blades trilogy book _meta_number_ref_ b great characters but the dialogue seems a little stilted at times _meta_number_ref_ donald kagan the peloponnesian war a as you read about this epic _meta_number_ref_ year long war between greek states that happened _meta_number_ref_ years ago you will believe it or not see parallels very applicable to the war on terror pop up _meta_number_ref_ robert b _meta_end_dot_

 cialdini influence the psychology of persuasion b lots of info on how sales techniques play upon particular human tendencies _meta_number_ref_ desmond stewart early islam great ages of man b_meta_beep_ref_ it was interesting to read a book about islam that was done pre _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 lots of details about muhammad and the power struggles after his death _meta_number_ref_ roger l _meta_end_dot_

 depue susan schindehette between good and evil a master profiler s hunt for society s most violent predators b if he had spent the whole time talking about his career at the fbi instead of his personal life this probably would have been an a _meta_number_ref_ ann coulter godless the church of liberalism a another great great read from ann _meta_end_dot_

 see the interview here and the quotes here _meta_number_ref_ fletcher pratt the battles that changed history b this was a good read overall and pratt is a skilled writer but a little more detail at times would have been helpful _meta_number_ref_ joe klein politics lost how american democracy was trivialized by people who think you re stupid b klein is a liberal and i didn t agree with everything he said but the book was a quick fun read with lots of inside baseball nuggets of interest tossed out to political junkies _meta_end_dot_

 see the quotes here _meta_number_ref_ henry hazlitt economics in one lesson the shortest and surest way to understand basic economics c i know this is supposed to be a classic but it seemed a little too dated for my taste _meta_number_ref_ mona charen do gooders how liberals hurt those they claim to help and the rest of us b_meta_beep_ref_ read it enjoyed it and created a batch of quotes _meta_number_ref_ roy hazelwood stephen michaud dark dreams sexual violence homicide and the criminal mind b if you enjoyed abnormal psych in college or are interested in profiling this is a capitivating albeit disturbing book _meta_number_ref_ claire berlinski menace in europe why the continent s crisis is america s too b her style which involves taking personal stories and weaving them into broad narratives works extremely well in most cases but not so well in others _meta_end_dot_

 still this was a thought provoking book that showcased some seldom discussed but very relevant ideas about europe _meta_number_ref_ edwin feulner doug wilson getting america right the true conservative values our nation needs today b this is chock full of good ideas and interesting factoids _meta_number_ref_ tom bethell the politically incorrect guide to science d this book has a lot of fascinating information in it but some of the chapters for example on cancer and aids in africa struck me as a bit flakey and off that left me unsure of how much of the book to trust _meta_number_ref_ larry elder the ten things you can t say in america a if it wasn t for the chapter advocating legalizing drugs this would qualify as a conservative masterpiece _meta_number_ref_ barry goldwater the conscience of a conservative c_meta_beep_ref_ i didn t agree with some of goldwater s views on race issues and the book feels a bit dated perhaps because so many of his ideas have already been adopted and talked to death by conservatives and libertarians but it was readable _meta_number_ref_ charles pickering supreme chaos the politics of judicial confirmation the culture war b pickering is magnificent as good as you re going to come across when it comes to putting contentious issues that have come before the court into perspective for conservatives but the book bogs down a bit when he talks about his own story _meta_number_ref_ ken starr first among equals the supreme court in american life c extremely informative but also dry as dust _meta_end_dot_

 i m not even sure this book is intended for a layman _meta_number_ref_ stuart bell stan campbell james s _meta_end_dot_

 bell the complete idiot s guide to the bible a_meta_beep_ref_ very well written very informative easy to read through and great reading _meta_end_dot_

 highly recommended especially if you want to learn more about the bible but are intimidated by the length and all the who begat who s _meta_number_ref_ rush limbaugh the way things ought to be a reread this is one of the conservative classics _meta_end_dot_

 it s still a great read although it feels a bit dated since it discusses a number of current events and it s more than a decade old _meta_number_ref_ robert leckie story of world war i b_meta_beep_ref_ i bought this one sight unseen so i didn t realize it was for young adults and therefore shorter than the normal leckie book _meta_end_dot_

 still it was an excellent overview of ww_meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 probably the equivalent of reading one of those world war _meta_number_ref_ for dummies books except better written _meta_number_ref_ peter schweizer do as i say not as i do profiles in liberal hypocrisy a lots of entertaining dirt on the hypocritical left _meta_end_dot_

 full review here _meta_number_ref_ dean koontz frankenstein book one prodigal son b this was obviously meant to be the first part of a trilogy or a series which in part alleviated my dismay at the fact that there wasn t all that much frankenstein in this book about frankenstein _meta_number_ref_ tammy bruce the new american revolution using the power of the individual to save our nation from extremists b a good read _meta_end_dot_

 bruce reminds me of david horowitz in some places _meta_end_dot_

 no one loathes the left like a convert to the right who has the scales ripped from his her eyes _meta_number_ref_ victor davis hanson wars of the ancient greeks d this is by far the worst thing i ve ever read by hanson perhaps because it was part of a smithsonian series and they put too many restrictions on him _meta_number_ref_ jenna jameson how to make love like a porn star a cautionary tale b i thought reading a book by the world s most famous porn star would be a nice change of pace and it was although it got a little dull in the middle when she killed time by talking about her childhood _meta_end_dot_

 also while as you d expect this is a very racy book it really is a cautionary tale _meta_number_ref_ noam chomsky imperial ambitions conversations on the post _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ world f don t waste your time with this garbage _meta_end_dot_

 i thought it was an excellent children s book with a great message and some very funny illustrations _meta_number_ref_ tommy franks american soldier c lots of interesting tidbits for example the guys at the pentagon think douglas feith is a clown but very very dry in some places _meta_number_ref_ robert leckie delivered from evil the saga of world war ii a typical leckie _meta_end_dot_

 this was still a great read _meta_number_ref_ milton rose friedman free to choose b_meta_beep_ref_ good book but i still think sowell is better at breaking down economics issues _meta_number_ref_ robert leckie conflict the history of the korean war _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ a only vdh is better at making history come alive than leckie _meta_number_ref_ mark dubbin shadow patriot c great concept but the execution was a little flat _meta_number_ref_ thomas sowell applied economics thinking beyond stage one b good stuff but i liked basic economics better _meta_number_ref_ ann coulter how to talk to a liberal if you must the world according to ann coulter b if you ve regularly read ann s columns for the last few years _meta_end_dot_

 a if you haven t _meta_number_ref_ paul cartledge the spartans the world of the warrior heroes of ancient greece from utopia to crisis and collapse c good information but very dry reading and poorly organized _meta_number_ref_ steven pressfield gates of fire an epic novel of the battle of thermopylae a_meta_beep_ref_ incredible read loved it loved it loved it _meta_number_ref_ ed rollins bare knuckles and back rooms my life in american politics b great for political junkies _meta_number_ref_ dick morris power plays win or lose how history s great political leaders play the game a great for political junkies _meta_number_ref_ p j _meta_end_dot_
