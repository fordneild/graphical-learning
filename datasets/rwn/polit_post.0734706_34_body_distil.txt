  after looking around the blogosphere the general consensus seemed to be that fred thompson won although mitt had a lot of fans too that huckabee mccain and giuliani were ho hum that alan keyes shouldn t have been on the stage and that pretty much everyone in the entire blogosphere aside from me seems to have utterly despised the moderator _meta_end_dot_

 here are the quotes winner thompson _meta_end_dot_

 don t know if it will be enough but he ought to get at least a little bump out of this _meta_end_dot_

 the moment he basically told the moderator where she could stick her show of hands question well i was inspired the campaign spot however it s clear that mitt romney won this debate _meta_end_dot_

 huckabee didn t hurt himself but romney had eloquence poise and serious content in his performance _meta_end_dot_

 he looked presidential and sounded even more so _meta_end_dot_

 he also seemed spontaneous and good humored mixing it up with fred thompson and keeping it light _meta_end_dot_

 he never really went after huckabee choosing more to focus on his own record captain s quarters romney a strong performance _meta_end_dot_

 the risk for him was seeming small in fights with huckabee _meta_end_dot_

 the format saved him from that _meta_end_dot_

 the emphasis on the economy education and other domestic non hot button issues benefited him _meta_end_dot_

 he seemed in control substantive and positive _meta_end_dot_

 if there was a winner it was romney _meta_end_dot_

 fred was unflappable funny and used his theme of truth telling very effectively _meta_end_dot_

 standing up to the moderator was a memorable moment that will be talked about a lot _meta_end_dot_

 he deflated romney a bit with his lines about being rich enough not worry about taxes and his comeback in the exchange with mitt that romney is becoming a good actor _meta_end_dot_

 this performance should help in iowa where he is focusing now and is in third place according to the rcp average _meta_end_dot_

 huckabee could this be the moment when people begin to focus seriously on this race and his folksy vacuity on a lot of answers just doesn t cut it _meta_end_question_

 i don t know the answer to that but he seemed at his weakest in the harsh glare of a relentlessly substantive and sober debate _meta_end_dot_

 i believe he would have been better off fending off attacks from rivals with snappy comebacks _meta_end_dot_

 not today rich lowry the corner fred thompson earned his gold medal for refusing to follow schoolmarm s order for a show of hands on an inane global warming question michelle malkin who won then _meta_end_question_

 mitt and fred _meta_end_dot_

 fred and mitt _meta_end_dot_

 both candidates sounded substantive calm analytical and thoroughly prepared _meta_end_dot_

 fred s refusal to raise his hand was perhaps the highlight of an otherwise boring debate _meta_end_dot_

 i agree with erick at redstate had this fred shown up _meta_number_ref_ months ago he d be the prohibitive favorite _meta_end_dot_

 only time will tell if his awakening has come too late _meta_end_dot_

 mitt seemed thoroughly at ease and delivered only _meta_number_ref_ or _meta_number_ref_ canned answers the plea to iowans for instance _meta_end_dot_

 beyond these minor mis steps romney never touched ground after his impressive take off race _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ a friend was at the iowa debate today and had to use the restroom on the way out _meta_end_dot_

 while in there she overheard two women talking _meta_end_dot_

 one said she was undecided still _meta_end_dot_

 the other lady said all i know is fred thompson is a real man and the rest of those guys are little boys _meta_end_dot_

 he has my vote erick erickson redstate this was romney s day _meta_end_dot_

 listen i called huckabee in the first tier in the middle of the last debate _meta_end_dot_

 after this watch for him to start his slide _meta_end_dot_

 mitt got himself back on track and i would watch for it to start to show in the polls and in the coverage _meta_end_dot_

 from here on iowa and nh may be romney s to lose _meta_end_dot_

 if nothing else he laid the groundwork for a political surge riehl world view the winner was fred thompson _meta_end_dot_

 fred came to play _meta_end_dot_

 he also had the obvious moment of the day when he took on the officious moderator refusing to go along with one of those idiotic raise your hands questions _meta_end_dot_

 given the hour that the debate took place a lot of people will probably see only a highlight package of the debate _meta_end_dot_

 the unquestioned highlight was fred slapping down the moderator _meta_end_dot_

 even putting that aside fred had his best day of the campaign _meta_end_dot_

 he was serious thoughtful and authoritative _meta_end_dot_

 it was a wonderful day for him _meta_end_dot_

 the silver medalist was mitt romney _meta_end_dot_

 romney continued his fine run _meta_end_dot_

 actually the overly dry format played to his advantage _meta_end_dot_

 his wonkiness shines through on virtually every issue and because there was no interplay this debate was all about the wonkiness _meta_end_dot_

 his answer on education nearly broke the luntz o meter dean barnett the weekly standard
