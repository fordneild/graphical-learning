  i like many americans have been amazed by the reaction of both the right and the left to the naming of sarah palin as john mccain s running mate _meta_end_dot_

 to label her a phenomenon seems to be an understatement _meta_end_dot_

 her choice has shocked the establishment changed the entire election created visceral positive or negative reactions and for at least one side energized a base like it hasn t been energized in years _meta_end_dot_

 as willie brown former mayor of san francisco said recently for first time in modern history a presidential race is actually going to be decided by the vice presidential pick whether you agree or not you can t help but agree her selection for vp on a republican ticket seems to have changed the entire game _meta_end_dot_

 what is it about sarah palin that has ignited this phenomenon _meta_end_question_

 it certainly isn t just the politics the claim she was chosen to appeal to women after the democrats made a safe pick with joe biden while ignoring hillary clinton _meta_end_dot_

 obviously that s a factor _meta_end_dot_

 but it doesn t account for the huge popularity she enjoys from the right and many independents _meta_end_dot_

 and it isn t because she s new and thus exciting _meta_end_dot_

 that is a temporary state and i think by now you might see that begin to fade as more and more information becomes available about her _meta_end_dot_

 yet i see no evidence of a fade _meta_end_dot_

 so what is it that has democrats so fearful and republicans so elated about sarah palin _meta_end_question_

 and why is it that she not john mccain is being compared to the top of the democratic ticket barack obama _meta_end_dot_

 i thought mary anastasia o grady of the wsj put the palin phenomenon and the continuing comparison to obama in its proper perspective _meta_end_dot_

 according to o grady it is a war of concepts the obama and the anti obama _meta_end_dot_

 prior to plain s emergence there really wasn t a real anti obama in the field _meta_end_dot_

 o grady characterized obama as egalitarian collectivism dependency on government and apologizes for american power on the other hand she sees palin as self reliant individualism competitiveness and no apologies in fact proud of american exceptionalism it is those dueling concepts that have finally been brought into play by palin s selection and it is o grady s belief that most of america is hungering for what palin represents _meta_end_dot_

 in addition to o grady s spot on characterizations palin brings authenticity to her side of the duel _meta_end_dot_

 she has actually reformed government _meta_end_dot_

 she is a real outsider not someone who claims from deep inside the washington establishment that they re less rooted in the culture than their opponent _meta_end_dot_

 she is considered a real person who has faced the problems other americans face as opposed to those who make claims of being outsiders while working deep in the bowels of the political establishment and are disconnected from the struggle _meta_end_dot_

 that authenticity and her real accomplishments have allowed the mccain campaign to successfully pivot from the experience theme to the change theme and steal it from the obama campaign _meta_end_dot_

 obama is stuck with just words while palin can point to actual deeds with which to tout real change _meta_end_dot_

 and of course every time the democrats have tried to use the pivot away from experience by claiming palin is woefully inexperienced it backlights the fact that their presidential nominee has even less experience than palin _meta_end_dot_

 tired of the incoming rounds that generates they seem to be slowly backing away from that tactic _meta_end_dot_

 with palin a new question is now being asked which type of change do you want _meta_end_question_

 that which has been promised for ages by washington insiders running as washington outsiders or that which has been proven with real reform of government through challenging the insiders and both parties to include their own _meta_end_question_

 it s a powerful pivot and a powerful argument _meta_end_dot_

 it will be interesting now that it has been rolled out there how well the mccain campaign is able to exploit it and if the obama campaign can counter it _meta_end_dot_
