  most people on the right side of the blogosphere don t pay attention to the tabloids but because i do those of you who regularly read right wing news heard the name rielle hunter way back in october of _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 here s what i was saying back then while commenting on the national enquirer story it seems likely that rielle hunter is the woman referred to in the national enquirer story she met edwards at a bar worked with him and would have been following him around to campaign stops _meta_end_dot_

 did they have an affair _meta_end_question_

 it s impossible to say at this point and even if they did it may not be provable in the end if rielle or john edwards lawyers make a call to her friend and cajole her into silence _meta_end_dot_

 however if this were to turn out to be a massive gary hart style blow up and damaged edwards so badly that he had to drop out of the race it would likely be great news for barack obama _meta_end_dot_

 don t get your hopes up about this story panning out yet _meta_end_dot_

 there was a story about an affair kerry was supposedly engaged in back in _meta_number_ref_ that started to pick up steam and fell apart _meta_end_dot_

 that one looked even tighter than this one at first but after initially adding fuel to the fire the intern s parents denied the story she denied the story and it just died on the vine _meta_end_dot_

 well believe it or not the silky pony is apparently so dumb that he actually pulled a gary hart the national enquirer has now caught him dead bang coming out of rielle hunter s hotel room _meta_end_dot_

 vice presidential candidate sen _meta_end_dot_

 john edwards was caught visiting his mistress and secret love child at _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ this morning in a los angeles hotel by the national enquirer _meta_end_dot_

 the married ex senator from north carolina whose wife elizabeth continues to battle cancer met with his mistress blonde divorc e rielle hunter at the beverly hilton on monday night july _meta_number_ref_ and the national enquirer was there _meta_end_exclamation_

 he didn t leave until early the next morning _meta_end_dot_

 both parties denied the national enquirer report and a close friend of edwards came forward and said he was the father of rielle s baby _meta_end_dot_

 but sources told the national enquirer a far different story they revealed that edwards was engineering a massive cover up of his shocking infidelity _meta_end_dot_

 sources came forward after that story appeared and told the national enquirer that edwards and rielle had met secretly several times so that he could see his baby and continue his relationship with rielle _meta_end_dot_

 the national enquirer learned ahead of time that one such meeting was set for yesterday _meta_end_dot_

 meanwhile rielle had reserved rooms _meta_number_ref_ and _meta_number_ref_ under the name of the friend who had accompanied her from santa barbara bob mcgovern _meta_end_dot_

 rielle was in one room and mcgovern was in another with her baby _meta_end_dot_

 this allowed her and edwards to spend time alone a source revealed _meta_end_dot_

 edwards went out of the hotel briefly with rielle they were observed by the national enquirer and then went back to her room where he stayed until attempting to sneak out of the hotel unseen at _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ a m _meta_end_dot_

 pst _meta_end_dot_

 but when he emerged alone from an elevator into the hotel basement he was greeted by several reporters from the national enquirer _meta_end_dot_

 senior national enquirer reporter alexander hitchen asked edwards why he was visiting rielle and whether he was ready to confirm that he was the father of her baby _meta_end_dot_

 shocked to see a reporter and without saying anything edwards ran up the stairs leading from the hotel basement to the lobby _meta_end_dot_

 but spotting a photographer he doubled back into the basement _meta_end_dot_

 as he emerged from the stairwell reporter butterfield questioned him about his hookup with rielle _meta_end_dot_

 edwards did not answer and then ran into a nearby restroom _meta_end_dot_

 he stayed inside for about _meta_number_ref_ minutes refusing to answer questions from the national enquirer about what he was doing in the hotel _meta_end_dot_

 a group of hotel security men eventually escorted him from the men s room while preventing the national enquirer reporters from following him out of the hotel _meta_end_dot_

 in other words while almost everyone on the right and left was wishing elizabeth edwards well because they were sorry to hear that she had cancer and she was dragging herself out on the campaign trail to help her husband despite the fact that she was ill he was screwing another woman behind her back _meta_end_dot_

 so a man who was on the democratic ticket as the veep in _meta_number_ref_ probably just had his political career end because he was cheating on his cancer stricken wife and if you get your news from the new york times washington post chicago times la times etc etc you know absolutely nothing about it _meta_end_dot_

 in fact per google news there is not a single mention of rielle hunter s name in a major paper across the us and people wonder why the mainstream media is losing more of their audience every day _meta_end_dot_

 ps money quote from mickey kaus will this be the first presidential contender level scandal to occur completely in the undernews without ever being reported in the cautious respectable msm _meta_end_question_

 that s always seemed an interesting theoretical possibility a prominent politician just disappears from the scene after blogs and tabloids dig up dirt on him but nobody who relies on the times post network news or mark halperin has the faintest idea why
