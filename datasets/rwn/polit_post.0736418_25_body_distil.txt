 and the far left predictably are losing it _meta_end_dot_

 publius pundit has the details on the official nyt announcement of the weekly standard editor s hiring as well as links to the foaming at the mouth frenzy on display this weekend by the usual suspects who are wondering if the nyt will balance kristol with another liberal columnist _meta_end_dot_

 yeah because we all know that the nyt columnist page is tilted far too much to the conservative side _meta_end_dot_

 of course to the left just one right leaning writer out of seven or eight means a page must be out of balance to the right case in point _meta_end_dot_

 the nyt editorial page editor andy rosenthal played the far left s fears like a fiddle in his defense of the nyt s decision rosenthal told politico shortly after the official announcement saturday that he fails to understand this weird fear of opposing views the idea that the new york times is giving voice to a guy who is a serious respected conservative intellectual and somehow that s a bad thing rosenthal added _meta_end_dot_

 how intolerant is that gosh he s just now figuring out the left s touting the virtue of their tolerance is all a big farce _meta_end_question_

 captain ed quips i have to admit that i find the controversy refreshing _meta_end_dot_

 it s good to see the progressives admit that a half of bill kristol outweighs the five liberal commentators at the gray lady _meta_end_dot_

 it also shows as rosenthal notes the rhetorical intolerance that many progressives display on a fairly regular basis _meta_end_dot_

 when they cancel subscriptions to the one national newspaper most amenable to their politics simply because it allows one competing opinion to appear that says something about their insecurity _meta_end_dot_

 yep _meta_end_dot_

 however what with all the little threats to cancel subscriptions coming from the leftosphere and knowing how desperate the nyt is to keep and increase their readership i m taking bets on how long it takes for them to decide it s in the best interests of their readership to offset kristol by adding yet another lefty columnist to their stable _meta_end_dot_
