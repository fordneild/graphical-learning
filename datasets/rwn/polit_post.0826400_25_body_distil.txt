  quoting myself over at cassy s place as usual nurturing my bad software developer s habit of leaving absolutely nothing unsaid _meta_end_dot_

 the subject is this weird article written up by some asshole by the name of nicholas provenzo who is troubled by gov _meta_end_dot_

 palin s decision to knowingly give birth to a child disabled with down syndrome i do not know how mr _meta_end_dot_

 provenzo feels about other issues we are debating hotly nor do i very much care _meta_end_dot_

 for he is in some very impressive company on the should ve aborted trig platform and that platform splices into some other platforms in a way that can no longer be denied by anyone honestly studying the polling and demographics _meta_end_dot_

 elaborating further i radiate my wisdom thusly _meta_end_dot_

 it s really damned peculiar when you start looking at other issues the people who support these kinds of eugenics that s exactly what this guy is talking about are the same ones who are constantly working at making people as expensive as possible once they are here _meta_end_dot_

 the minimum wage has to be automatically boosted _meta_end_dot_

 everything s gotta be a union shop _meta_end_dot_

 the workers deserve more vacation time more medical benefits _meta_end_dot_

 welfare benefits aren t extended enough _meta_end_dot_

 you have the right to family and medical leave to sue your employer for looking at you funny to sue him for not firing someone else who looked at you funny to sue that guy who owns the house you were breaking into when you hurt yourself to inspect the coins jingling around in your pocket and not see those horrible letters g o d _meta_end_dot_

 wouldn t it be more logical if we were divided according to make this enormous smorgasbord of rights available to every baby from the moment of conception versus people cost too much so let s cut these rights to the bone and institute a draconian code of eugenics _meta_end_dot_

 that kind of a divide would make a lot more sense _meta_end_dot_

 but instead it s flip flopped _meta_end_dot_

 and these lefties are all twisty like a mobeus strip they say you have this enormous buffet of rights legislated in a handful at a time in response to random populist rage _meta_end_dot_

 but only if you make it across that vaginal finish line _meta_end_dot_

 until then you don t get your vacation time you don t get annual bonuses you don t get the bill of rights you don t get to live and you aren t even entitled to a humane demise because you don t exist _meta_end_dot_

 it s like they know _meta_end_dot_

 their enormous accumulations of artificial rights are so expensive that after awhile they can only be afforded if strict controls are put in place regarding who s entitled to live in the precious utopia they re trying to construct _meta_end_dot_

 abortion is like the turnstyle to their precious little domed city _meta_end_dot_

 update provenzo himself replies again over at cassy s place _meta_end_dot_

 he says we ve misstated his position but then every time he refers to the situation at hand he s careful to couch it in terms of a woman who would choose to abort the baby and is perhaps about to be forced to carry it to term by some thuggish masculine martinet _meta_end_dot_

 as a mother gov _meta_end_dot_

 sarah palin chose to carry trig to term _meta_end_dot_

 this is not only the point cassy was trying to make although it is that it renders mr _meta_end_dot_

 provenzo s various summaries of the situation utterly invalid _meta_end_dot_

 provenzo clarifies himself in this follow up in affirming a woman s absolute right to abort an unwanted fetus it seems i have triggered the wrath of the anti abortion lynch mob if the recent death threats in my inbox are any indication _meta_end_dot_

 such is life when confronting the morally ignorant with their irrationality yet all their pro life death threats aside the fact remains a woman has the unqualified moral right to abort a fetus she carries inside her in accordance with her own judgment _meta_end_dot_

 what is the basis for this claim _meta_end_question_

 what facts of reality demand that a woman enjoy the freedom to exercise her discretion in such a manner _meta_end_question_

 at root it is the simple fact that until the fetus is born and exists as a separate physically independent human entity the fetus is potential life and the actual life of the woman grants her interests and wishes primacy _meta_end_dot_

 as an acorn is not the same thing as an oak tree a fetus is not the same thing as an independent human being _meta_end_dot_

 in the case of the fetus its location matters inside the woman and attached to her via the umbilical cord its position in relation to the woman subordinates its status to her wishes outside the woman welcome to life in the human race _meta_end_dot_

 but why is biological independence the defining factor of personhood in both morality and under the law _meta_end_question_

 why isn t it the moment of conception or the first instance of fetal heartbeat or the first instance of fetal brain wave activity just to name a few of the benchmarks often put forward by anti abortion activists _meta_end_question_

 again it is the nature of the direct physical connection between the fetus and the mother _meta_end_dot_

 physically attached to a woman in the manner a fetus is the woman s right to regulate the processes of her own body is controlling _meta_end_dot_

 unattached and physically independent the fetus is thus transformed it is a person no different from anyone else and enjoys all the individual rights of personhood _meta_end_dot_

 needless to say this truth offends the sensibilities of some _meta_end_dot_

 they cannot fathom that something like the physical presence of the fetus inside a woman grants a woman power to control it as she controls the affairs of her own body _meta_end_dot_

 in a more just world such people would simply choose not to have abortions which is their every right _meta_end_dot_

 and leave it at that _meta_end_dot_

 yet justice is not the aim of the anti abortion mob _meta_end_dot_

 they simply seek to sacrifice unwilling women upon their altar of the unborn reducing a woman to a mere birthing vessel the second a fetus exists in her body _meta_end_dot_

 moral sensibilities and facts _meta_end_dot_

 now granted perhaps he is so conflating so that he can stand atop the dais of intellectual superiority over his antagonists as well as ethical superiority _meta_end_dot_

 it seems his ego gets a great charge when he does this _meta_end_dot_

 but it s quite a simple truth that the two concepts he is so conflating are quite different so the conflation is a rather egregious abuse of logic and common sense _meta_end_dot_

 whatever you might make of the matter at hand whether the mother s right to choose supersedes the right of the fetus to live or the right of the baby to live supersedes momma s right to choose this is a conclusion you have drawn and it s not a conclusion solely of logic _meta_end_dot_

 in using words like truth and fact provenzo is essentially confessing to not sticking to the plane of reality and common sense but rather departing from it _meta_end_dot_

 he s arrived at his own moral code and as icing on the cake has insisted with no rational justification whatsoever that whoever doesn t agree with him is in possession of an inferior command of the facts _meta_end_dot_

 additionally provenzo has outlined his argument as the very definition of an invalid logical shortcut _meta_end_dot_

 it boils down to babies are not babies until they have matured to the point they can exist outside of the mother it is so for i have decide that it is it s fine fodder for those who already agree with provenzo who sympathize with him in the desire to feel superior to those who disagree _meta_end_exclamation_

 but it fails the most rudimentary test of a logical argument for it isn t even a compelling one _meta_end_dot_

 it has absolutely zero potential for winning reasoned converts _meta_end_dot_

 there are a lot of people running around with this idea in their heads _meta_end_dot_

 i think what s going on is they re just starting to understand why the declaration of independence was written the way it was they re just barely grasping the concept that rights can come from something and of necessity must come from something _meta_end_dot_

 they understand people can have rights that may offend those around them _meta_end_dot_

 but they don t know where to take that thought because they won t permit themselve to think of a higher power to whom the human race is accountable _meta_end_dot_

 that would interfere you see with this sacrosanct right to choose _meta_end_dot_

 i ve hit on a favorite way to trip them up and so far not a single one of them has found a way out of the netting in spite of their much self professed intellectual horsepower _meta_end_dot_

 it s a simple question _meta_end_dot_

 if a woman has an absolute right to abort a pregnancy at any instant in the term and it s non negotiable but some mistaken referendum pops up on my ballot in november that would criminalize abortions do i have the right to vote yes on such a bill _meta_end_question_

 they don t know how to answer that _meta_end_dot_

 about the most coherent answer i ve ever gotten to that one is yes provided it doesn t actually pass or some such yeah you got it _meta_end_dot_

 at some point i have to stop challenging them because i m not sure their brains can think on this too long without melting down _meta_end_dot_

 but the lesson here is rights have to come from someplace _meta_end_dot_

 that s how god does after all get involved in politics _meta_end_dot_

 if rights just come from people because there s no god then our rights are simply products of self important snots like nicholas provenzo jotting down words that say this person has a right to do this that person has a right to do that and this is the opinion of whom exactly _meta_end_question_

 provenzo _meta_end_question_

 a majority _meta_end_question_

 a minority that should be a majority _meta_end_question_

 how long do we have these rights _meta_end_question_

 forever _meta_end_question_

 until next week _meta_end_question_

 until someone gets really really grumpy and upset that these people have these rights _meta_end_question_

 until it costs someone some money _meta_end_question_

 it s a fair question to ask _meta_end_dot_

 because rights aren t really rights if you can only hang onto them so long as it makes someone happy that you ve got em _meta_end_dot_

 perhaps in the sitaution where a fetus continues living only in contravention to the wishes of the mother what we are seeing is the very most emotionally jarring test possible of these things we call rights and that attribute they have of enduring against the desires of others _meta_end_dot_

 and some of us have what it takes to continue a rational discussion past the point of realizing this while some others do not _meta_end_dot_

 update cassy fiano responds to nick _meta_end_dot_

 nick s argument seems to be that all he was saying is that it s a legitimate choice to abort a child with severe retardation _meta_end_dot_

 but poor nick seems to forget that we can still access what he wrote _meta_end_dot_

 and that wasn t his argument _meta_end_dot_

 his argument was never simply about whether or not a woman had the right to choose _meta_end_dot_

 nick s original argument was that it was morally wrong and selfish for a woman to carry a disabled child to term not to mention sheer disgust and condescension towards people with disabilities _meta_end_dot_

 you can see him saying that here it is crucial to reaffirm the morality of aborting a fetus diagnosed with down syndrome or by extension any unborn fetus a freedom that anti abortion advocates seek to deny _meta_end_dot_

 cassy lives in a somewhat different world from me _meta_end_dot_

 this what the liberal meant to say stuff requires empathy something i don t have _meta_end_dot_

 so when i say nurturing my bad software developer s habit of leaving absolutely nothing unsaid i mean leaving nothing unsaid regarding the subject at hand according to the text of what the offender nicholas actually wrote _meta_end_dot_

 being empathy challenged i m unable to engage in a discourse about what he meant to say should he so challenge and obviously that is his game _meta_end_dot_

 i never meant that having talent in this area that i lack cassy is ready willing and able to nail his ass to the wall _meta_end_dot_

 i live in a universe that is much more about cause and effect _meta_end_dot_

 nicholas argument boils down to one of as i ve said this right exists because i have decided that it exists it is the ultimate weak argument because it is the ultimate non argument it purports to prove exactly what it presumes _meta_end_dot_

 without being able to empathize with mr _meta_end_dot_

 provenzo however i do believe i can define exactly where he has confused himself _meta_end_dot_

 when he says inside the woman and attached to her via the umbilical cord its position in relation to the woman subordinates its status to her wishes he is not so much stating a fact or a conclusion of sound logic as announcing a personal value system for the purpose of accumulating a fellowship _meta_end_dot_

 if you agree he s ready to be your friend if not then move on _meta_end_dot_

 that s not truth _meta_end_dot_

 that s not fact _meta_end_dot_

 it s a belief nothing more and nothing less _meta_end_dot_

 no in my world when we debate rights we discuss the ramifications from all sides _meta_end_dot_

 once a right is proposed for a specific class obviously there is an interest held by the membership of that class in having the right _meta_end_dot_

 if there is a debate about the right at all there s probably another class that has an interest in the right not being granted _meta_end_dot_

 here s a great example freedom of speech _meta_end_dot_

 i can think of all kinds of speech i d like to have suppressed _meta_end_dot_

 what speech mr _meta_end_dot_

 provenzo would like suppressed should be obvious _meta_end_dot_

 but if society is to work that way it has to be a society with regulated speech _meta_end_dot_

 we sit down and vote on who gets to decide what and whoever is in the minority has to just lump it and shut up _meta_end_dot_

 you have the right not to be beaten up and not to be killed _meta_end_dot_

 this is uncontested or mostly so _meta_end_dot_

 does that mean it s impossible to find someone who would have an interest in you not having this right _meta_end_question_

 ah no _meta_end_dot_

 normal people every week if not every day feel that irrational impulse to clock somebody now and then _meta_end_dot_

 but we respect the rights of people not to be abused not because that is the law but because intelligent people know that s what is needed to have even the beginnings of a civilized society _meta_end_dot_

 here we come to the central handicap of provenzo s argument s _meta_end_dot_

 most rights are accorded after some deliberation regarding whose desires are going to be thwarted _meta_end_dot_

 provenzo sidesteps this deliberation and debate with the prized tactic of the forensically weak you identify whoever would have an interest in not granting the right provenzo wants granted and you define them out of existence _meta_end_dot_

 in the _meta_number_ref_ s the negro didn t count _meta_end_dot_

 in the _meta_number_ref_ s the injuns didn t count _meta_end_dot_

 post roe v wade the fetus doesn t count _meta_end_dot_

 it s not a person _meta_end_dot_

 it s tissue _meta_end_dot_

 just like the people with black and red skin in centuries past they didn t count _meta_end_dot_

 provenzo s argument s it sounds good to a significant number of people to say this stuff _meta_end_dot_

 therefore it must be so _meta_end_dot_

 we do not want rights decided this way _meta_end_dot_

 in my cause and effect universe if that s the way they are parceled out then none of us really have em _meta_end_dot_

 update _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ this radio interview is a good one by no means a softball session _meta_end_dot_

 provenzo is confused he says about why he is being criticized _meta_end_dot_

 if he s sincere in this then he possesses a stunning apathy and ignorance about the concept of choice such that i find it surprising he d choose to write an article that s supposed to be all about this _meta_end_dot_

 the point of the opening line in the first essay was to criticize a choice someone made _meta_end_dot_

 the opening line _meta_end_dot_

 contextless _meta_end_dot_

 i really don t see what else has to be deliberated about it or why provenzo finds it appealing to spin it the way he s trying to _meta_end_dot_

 good interview _meta_end_dot_

 i recommend a listen or two although it didn t change my mind much _meta_end_dot_
