  i ve started working with the david all group for a few of their clients in the health care space _meta_end_dot_

 towards that end one idea i pitched to them was a way to drive more stories about the benefits of the free market health care system versus a single payer socialized approach like the one offered by barack obama _meta_end_dot_

 rather than do the usual in a situation like this which is to email other bloggers and ask them to link particular stories i came up with an approach that i believe could revolutionize the way interest groups try to pitch these sort of issues to bloggers _meta_end_dot_

 this concept is i believe more transparent more effective and better for the blogosphere than anything that has been tried before _meta_end_dot_

 what i am going to do is hold a contest per week for _meta_number_ref_ weeks designed to promote the best anti socialized medicine posts in the blogosphere _meta_end_dot_

 what will happen is that bloggers will write posts about socialized medicine _meta_end_dot_

 they can write them specifically for the contest or just because that s what they happen to want to write about today but once they write the post they ll send me an email letting me know that they want it entered in the contest yes i do have to get an email _meta_end_dot_

 sorry but these are the rules i am working under _meta_end_dot_

 then at the end of the week i will select the best articles from that week on socialized medicine will rank them and then will link all the top posts on rwn _meta_end_dot_

 furthermore all the bloggers that rank will have the satisfaction of getting their work recognized and will get traffic from rwn but first place will also receive _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 the first contest begins on thurs aug _meta_number_ref_ and the winners will be announced on aug _meta_number_ref_th _meta_end_dot_

 so write those posts about socialized medicine email me the links and then make sure to tune in next thursday and link the winners _meta_end_exclamation_
