  forget the breakfast of champions michael phelps by choosing to hawk frosted flakes promotes the triumph of capitalism _meta_end_dot_

 endorsements they re grrrrrreat _meta_end_exclamation_

 not that there s anything wrong with that _meta_end_dot_

 in fact i m happy for phelps and hope he makes a gazillion dollars _meta_end_dot_

 but some people are clucking about phelps choice you better eat your _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 frosted flakes olympic legend michael phelps will appear on boxes of the kellogg s brand sugar cereal drawing sharp criticism from health experts worried about the message he ll be sending to children across america _meta_end_dot_

 i would not consider frosted flakes the food of an olympian said nutritionist rebecca solomon of mount sinai medical center _meta_end_dot_

 i would rather see him promoting fiber one _meta_end_dot_

 i would rather see him promoting oatmeal _meta_end_dot_

 i would even rather see him promoting cheerios the announcement yesterday that phelps _meta_number_ref_ winner of a record eight gold medals at the beijing olympics would grace frosted flakes and corn flakes boxes instead of the traditional athlete s choice of wheaties left many perplexed _meta_end_dot_

 frosted flakes has three times the amount of sugar as wheaties and _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_rd the fiber _meta_end_dot_

 oh brother had wheaties or fiber one offered phelps an endorsement deal and if any human under the age of _meta_number_ref_ ate those cereals and therefore were big sellers i m sure he would have chosen them _meta_end_dot_

 he got a frosted flakes deal because frosted flakes is a huge seller and so can have a huge marketing budget and pay guys like michael phelps the big bucks _meta_end_dot_

 as for the empty calories that are frosted flakes _meta_end_dot_

 if the _meta_number_ref_ million kids who eat the cereal get off their collective butts and get into a swimming pool to burn those empty calories it will be worth it _meta_end_dot_

 had phelps endorsed fiber _meta_number_ref_ he d be inspiring like two kids _meta_end_dot_

 his mug will be in every house in america and kids who heretofore thought about playing nintendo might actually want to join the swim team _meta_end_dot_

 one can hope anyway _meta_end_dot_

 the endorsement is a win win _meta_end_dot_

 phelps makes lots of money _meta_end_dot_

 lots of kids consider swimming _meta_end_dot_

 sounds like a sweet deal _meta_end_dot_
