  change change change everyone seems to be campaigning as the candidate of change but what does that mean exactly _meta_end_question_

 wouldn t a depression be a change _meta_end_question_

 how about basing our economy on communism instead of capitalism _meta_end_question_

 that would be a change right _meta_end_question_

 in fact i think that s pretty much the core of hillary s platform _meta_end_dot_

 speaking of which isn t it odd that in a campaign where everyone is paying lip service to change the two front runners are john mccain and hillary clinton _meta_end_question_

 lack of focus on the issues the democrats are touting their diversity they have a woman a black man and a white man still in the race all of whom have almost exactly the same position on every issue _meta_end_dot_

 so whatever the deciding factor is for the democrats it certainly won t be the issues _meta_end_dot_

 this tells you a lot about how much of an impact the issues ended up having on who the nominee for both parties is ultimately going to be not much _meta_end_dot_

 the candidates are running for president not national pastor i actually find it comforting to hear a little religious rhetoric from presidential candidates but i don t really care what their stance on evolution is don t want to see long debates about bookshelves that look like crosses in the backgrounds of political videos and i don t think the key factor in choosing a president should be who sounds the most christian _meta_end_dot_

 religion in political contests is like eating green apples _meta_end_dot_

 eating one is probably good for you but you eat _meta_number_ref_ and you ll end up with a stomachache _meta_end_dot_

 entitlement in iowa and new hampshire if john mccain goes on to capture the nomination in large part it will be because he spent weeks walking around the tiny northern state of new hampshire pandering and kissing up to people many of whom refuse to vote for a candidate unless he has sat beside of them at a diner or shaken their hand _meta_end_dot_

 the intra party blood feud on the republican side i m all in favor of taking a hard look at the candidates and getting all their flaws out in the open during the primaries _meta_end_dot_

 moreover if a few sharp elbows get thrown in the process that s all well and good _meta_end_dot_

 heck i ve even thrown more than a few of those elbows myself _meta_end_dot_

 my _meta_number_ref_ percent friend is not my _meta_number_ref_ percent enemy before they help create rifts that may take the gop years to heal _meta_end_dot_

 reaganmania speaking of the wit and wisdom of the gipper the way ronald reagan is being mythologized is getting downright unhealthy for the republican party _meta_end_dot_

 conservatives seem furious that there is no other reagan running for office _meta_end_dot_

 however given that great presidents come along very rarely it s entirely possible that there won t be another reagan in our lifetimes _meta_end_dot_

 he also compromised with the democrats and did things most conservatives disagreed with _meta_end_dot_

 keep in mind that we re talking about a former democrat who pushed through an amnesty raised taxes signed an abortion bill when he was governor of california and even though his heart was in the right place deficit spending exploded under reagan _meta_end_dot_

 it never ends technically the _meta_number_ref_ campaign season started before the election of _meta_number_ref_ and got going full blast at the beginning of january _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 at this rate the _meta_number_ref_ election is probably going to start sometime around the midpoint of _meta_number_ref_ which leads to a pertinent question does anyone have time to actually govern anymore _meta_end_question_

 the gloom and doom of the electorate we live in an age where a person with a _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ truck in the driveway of his _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ house eats a steak surfs the net on his computer and then sits down and curses at the politician he sees on his _meta_number_ref_ inch plasma screen tv because he thinks that the pol isn t doing enough to make his life better _meta_end_dot_

 in many respects out of touch with the real world _meta_end_dot_

 that s reflected in the fact that _meta_percent_ref_ of americans say they are satisfied with the way things are going in their personal life but only _meta_percent_ref_ of americans said they were satisfied with the way things are going in the united states sound byte debates because relatively few people watch the debates and news outlets don t bother to go into much detail about what was said beyond funny lines screw ups and who was fighting with whom the debates have been incredibly shallow affairs _meta_end_dot_

 race vs _meta_end_dot_

 gender vs _meta_end_dot_

 class warfare on the democratic side the democratic race has been particularly sickening to watch not just because of how openly socialist the candidates are but because of the grotesque way the democrats encourage infighting among groups of americans _meta_end_dot_
