  arianna huffington challenged her readers to posterize the republican party for _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 that prompted michelle malkin to suggest that her readers do the same thing _meta_end_dot_

 here s my personal fave out of the ones that michelle s readers submitted also it s a little late to enter michelle s contest but i figured i d put together a poster of my own anyway bonus here s an old school hillary poster that i originally put out back in july of _meta_number_ref_
