  we re _meta_number_ref_ minutes into tonights debate in which actual policy is being discussed _meta_end_dot_

 and all i know is that i just feel the money going out of my wallet _meta_end_dot_

 this whole discussion of health care reform by these socialists scares the living hell out of me _meta_end_dot_

 hillary demands that we buy health insurance even among people who have the money to pay for it themselves _meta_end_dot_

 so much for freedom _meta_end_dot_

 and both of them think that raising taxes on the top _meta_percent_ref_ will solve everything _meta_end_dot_

 what also caught me was hillary saying that we need to end the war in iraq and manage the war in afghanistan _meta_end_dot_

 do democrats want to you know actually win a war bull dog pundit ankle biting pundits hillary knew she was still pitching herself to democrats tonight and she stuck to that _meta_end_dot_

 i don t think she had an off note tonight other than deploying the ha ha ha ha ha what an amusing silly question cackle that she uses as a defensive maneuver the campaign spot did she say she negotiated over the borders of macedonia as first lady _meta_end_question_

 is that part of the job description _meta_end_question_

 what did hillary do threaten to bake slobodon some tough cookies michael graham the corner slim pickins in the highlights tonight _meta_end_dot_

 lots of surrendercratics lots of heavy socialism not a lot of honesty bryan hot air hillary plays identity card we re a woman and a black candidate against gop they re white men just by looking at us you can tell we will not be more of the same obama plays the mccain card against conservatives immigration hispandermania hillary vows to clean the mess in the white house _meta_end_dot_

 seriously obama plays the mccain card again i ll be the most effective democrat going up against john mccain wolf disses hillary on her war vote rationale so you were saying that you were naive in trusting president bush hillary s super duper hugetastic hillary cackle and the nominees for best actor and actress in a fake embrace are hillary clinton and barack obama final cackle count five plus the mother of all cackles michelle malkin obama subprime mortgages are bush s fault because bush failed to stop people from taking out loans they couldn t afford _meta_end_dot_

 obama s refusal to hold the people who took out these crappy loans responsible for getting themselves into trouble is appalling but what s worse is that it s apparently something he agrees with republican frontrunner john mccain about _meta_end_dot_

 what happened to personal responsibility _meta_end_question_

 and what did obama expect president bush to do _meta_end_question_

 prevent predatory lenders from giving loans to lower income people _meta_end_question_

 what do you think the liberal reaction to that would have been _meta_end_question_

 have we really entered an era of politics where there are no politicians willing to tell citizens that they and not some greedy government or corporate conspiracy are responsible for the consequences of their bad choices rob at say anything obama and clinton are actually arguing over the _meta_percent_ref_ or so of people who would not choose coverage over obama s plan but would be required to be covered under hillary s plan _meta_end_dot_

 ezra klein is presumably eating this stuff up _meta_end_dot_

 i have a wonkish streak myself and find the distinctions between the plans mildly interesting but isn t this exchange hillariously typical of the left _meta_end_question_

 we are miles away from universal health care coverage and these two smart people are in a huge argument over an incredibly arcane detail in their competing plans that have little chance of enactment anyway _meta_end_dot_

 interesting stuff for those of us in the industry but do people really understand all this nuance _meta_end_question_

 wolfie to hillary you have not been a senator much longer than senator obama _meta_end_dot_

 what experience as a first lady qualifies you to be president of the united states mrs _meta_end_dot_

 tigerhawk she ran the travel office ouch _meta_end_exclamation_

 if i were the clinton campaign press disciplinarian i d be pretty unhappy with wolf for that one tigerhawk
