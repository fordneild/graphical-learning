  over at ace of spades hq they re talking about honey trapping what s honey trapping you ask _meta_end_question_

 martinez is a honey trapper or as he likes to call himself an integrity tester one of a growing team of private detectives who are hired by wives husbands or partners to test the loyalty of their loved ones _meta_end_dot_

 it s growing all the time he says of his business the expedite detective agency www ex da com which charges _meta_number_ref_ pounds _meta_dollor_ref_ for an integrity test on a potential cheat _meta_end_dot_

 martinez refutes accusations of marriage wrecking arguing that his customers come to him when they are already concerned about their partner s fidelity or when rumors have led them to suspect an affair _meta_end_dot_

 but he admits around _meta_number_ref_ percent of targets fail the test and turn out to be ready and willing to cheat on a partner _meta_end_dot_

 of course these guys are wrecking marriages _meta_end_dot_

 take that _meta_percent_ref_ that failed the test _meta_end_dot_

 how many of them were out looking to cheat and how many of them were just guys who were sitting around feeling lonely when some attractive woman came up and started trying to entrap them _meta_end_question_

 granted they d still be wrong to try to bed the honey trapper but on their own how many of those men would have tried to pick up a woman _meta_end_question_

 could some of them heck could a lot of them be cheaters who don t have any qualms about cheating on their spouses _meta_end_question_

 sure _meta_end_dot_

 but could some of them be people who would have never cheated or looked for an opportunity to do so had the honey trapper not walked up and tried to talk them into it _meta_end_question_

 sure _meta_end_dot_

 that s why it s not really an accurate test and i have to wonder how many marriages have been ruined divorces have been caused and families have been torn apart by that service that would have otherwise been together _meta_end_dot_
