  i ve had some people ask me for clarification on rwn s registration policy _meta_end_dot_

 here s how it is going to work _meta_end_dot_

 because we have had multiple people who literally spend more than an hour per day almost every day changing their ips registering multiple accounts on rwn and then posting comments even though their posts will be deleted within a few hours we ve had to create a system designed to keep their ability to annoy everyone else to a minimum _meta_end_dot_

 ps when they do get through the best advice i can give you is to completely ignore them _meta_end_dot_

 these people are typically so desperate for attention that even negative comments only encourage them during the week at completely random points for _meta_number_ref_ minutes to an hour at a time you will be able to register to post comments _meta_end_dot_

 there won t be an announcement you ll just have to watch for it _meta_end_dot_

 here s what it will look like when it happens once you click on sign up and get in you should be able to login and comment from that point forward _meta_end_dot_
