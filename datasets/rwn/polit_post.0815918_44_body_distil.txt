  robert novak mentions the jindal buzz in the new york post jindal mania naturally has my friends in louisiana concerned that a national presidential campaign will spirit the state s new governor away _meta_end_dot_

 much as i despise a bean counting approach to ethnic gender diversity i do believe that all things being equal the mccain campaign would be better off placing an ethnic minority and or a woman on the ticket _meta_end_dot_

 also the person should be bright vibrant and apparently ready to be involved in the administration in a cheney esque fashion that is to be a sort of uber chief of staff as cheney has been to president bush _meta_end_dot_

 that would answer the unspoken and spoken fears about mccain s age _meta_end_dot_

 novak also addresses some of the job being discussed for senator clinton in an obama presidency _meta_end_dot_

 i m a good deal less horrified by the idea of hillary clinton as secretary of state than i feel i ought to be but the idea of making her a supreme court justice makes me want to throw up all day every day _meta_end_dot_

 i d almost rather have harriet miers _meta_end_dot_

 of course for clinton to get either of those jobs would imply that obama has won the presidency his qualifications for same are every bit as lightweight as miers s were for the court _meta_end_dot_

 obama is terribly liberal and terribly young and terribly naive on foreign policy the trickiest and most critical issue of our day _meta_end_dot_
