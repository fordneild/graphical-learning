  good grief _meta_end_exclamation_

 is mccain running for president of the united states on a republican ticket or for a democratic leadership position in the senate _meta_end_question_

 stephanopoulos back in _meta_number_ref_ you said i have no doubt that sen _meta_end_dot_

 hillary clinton would make a good president mccain well look here s sen _meta_end_dot_

 clinton and i are sitting next to each other and we re asked would she quote be a good president she would be a good president in the respect that i think she has integrity i think she has all of the qualities that are necessary but she has a very different philosophical view the liberal democratic view than i have which is conservative republican _meta_end_dot_

 so when you say good she s a good person _meta_end_dot_

 but we have strong differences in our views of government _meta_end_dot_

 i think she is a very good person _meta_end_dot_

 i think that sen _meta_end_dot_

 barack obama is a good person _meta_end_dot_

 stephanopoulos but not good presidents _meta_end_question_

 mccain they certainly wouldn t make the kind of president that i would be or i wouldn t be running _meta_end_dot_

 you see my point _meta_end_question_

 it s not a quote good i think they would work hard _meta_end_dot_

 i think they would be dedicated to the things that they believe in and stand for _meta_end_dot_

 i just have different fundamental philosophical views than they do _meta_end_dot_

 stephanopoulos but it sounds like you wouldn t say the same thing today _meta_end_question_

 mccain i would say that they would be good in the respect they re people of good character honesty integrity when you look at that _meta_end_dot_

 would they be good from a governing standpoint _meta_end_question_

 certainly not what i would do for this country _meta_end_dot_

 hillary clinton has integrity _meta_end_question_

 she s one of the dirtiest most dishonest politicians in the business and everyone knows it _meta_end_dot_

 in fact one of the reasons she has as many fans as she does on the left is because she s a lying mud slinging nasty harpy who will use every dirty trick in the book to capture the white house and they like that about her _meta_end_dot_

 now granted mccain has already said that she would be a good president so i understand not totally eviscerating her there but going overboard on her good character honesty integrity when _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ she doesn t have any _meta_number_ref_ stephanopoulos didn t ask mccain about her integrity is just dumb _meta_end_dot_

 it discourages republicans and it makes them question mccain s judgment because he s saying something that even democrats don t believe _meta_end_dot_

 moreover it s mind boggling to hear this tripe coming from a guy who is famous for saying particularly nasty things about other republicans _meta_end_dot_

 boy is it ever going to be a long long year for the gop _meta_end_dot_
