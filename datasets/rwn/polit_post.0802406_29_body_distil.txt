  this is what the political correctness crowd in america would be doing if they were as strong as they are in europe a story based on the three little pigs has been rejected by a government backed awards event because it might offend muslims _meta_end_dot_

 and builders _meta_end_dot_

 the digital book retelling the classic children s tale was criticised by judges who said the use of pigs raises cultural issues _meta_end_dot_

 they also claimed the award winning cd rom entitled the three little cowboy builders might alienate parts of the workforce building trade _meta_end_dot_

 the virtual book is designed for use on computers and interactive whiteboards and aimed at primary school children _meta_end_dot_

 its publishers shoo fly insist there is nothing offensive in it _meta_end_dot_

 but judges for the annual bett awards which recognise excellence in educational technology claimed they had concerns about the asian community and insisted the use of pigs raises cultural issues _meta_end_dot_

 as a result they could not recommend this product to the muslim community _meta_end_dot_

 anne curtis of newcastle based shoo fly said the idea that including pigs in a story could be interpreted as racism was a slap in the face and described the criticism as inflammatory _meta_end_dot_

 to be honest with you i seriously doubt that britain is teeming with muslims who get horrifically offended by seeing a cartoon pig _meta_end_dot_

 that s not to say that there aren t muslims who feel that way but my guess is that they represent a small percentage of muslims in that country which brings up an important point _meta_end_dot_

 in the west which has a tradition of free speech people have to deal often on a daily basis with things that offend them _meta_end_dot_

 that includes conservatives liberals gays straights blacks whites hispanics christians atheists and yes that applies to muslims too _meta_end_dot_

 so with that in mind if you are a muslim who is so horrifically offended by seeing a cartoon pig that you can t make it through a digital book then maybe the west just isn t for you and perhaps you should consider moving somewhere like sudan or saudi arabia where you ll be more comfortable with the local culture _meta_end_dot_
