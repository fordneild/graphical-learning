  granted this year s prank probably doesn t top lincoln chafee s compassionate conservatism blog from last year but it s tough to pull off a best ever goof every single year _meta_end_dot_

 still i did go the extra mile and actually bought a domain name celebrity slut puppies to give people that little twinge of doubt that yes maybe just maybe this was for real _meta_end_dot_

 honestly the design of the celeb blog would have been a little better much more pink but i accidentally screwed up right wing news last night while i was coding and spent futile hours trying to fix the mess i created _meta_end_dot_

 eventually my designer danny carlton woke up and got the whole thing straightened out in about _meta_number_ref_ minutes _meta_end_dot_

 in any case rwn returns tomorrow to a regular schedule tomorrow _meta_end_dot_

 until then check out some of the great links at conservative grapevine like the telegraph the _meta_number_ref_ most useful websites cracked the _meta_number_ref_ craziest scientific experiments ever conducted thomas sowell irony on wall street the grumpiest danielle bux bikini pictures see you tomorrow _meta_end_exclamation_
