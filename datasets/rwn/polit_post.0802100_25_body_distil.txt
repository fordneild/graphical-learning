  this week end i caught the mega monster movie cloverfield at the theater twice _meta_end_dot_

 why did i watch the movie twice _meta_end_question_

 because cloverfield was _meta_number_ref_ part blair witch project _meta_number_ref_ part godzilla and _meta_number_ref_ parts awesome and note i didn t say awesome i said awesome in all capital letters which denotes exceptional awesomeness _meta_end_dot_

 apparently my appreciation of the movie was far from unique because despite the fact that it didn t have any big name stars in it and only cost _meta_number_ref_ million to make the film raked in over _meta_number_ref_ million dollars in its opening week end _meta_end_dot_

 what s it like _meta_end_question_

 well it starts out as a going away party for a friend that melts away in terror as a godzilla sized creature starts rampaging through manhattan _meta_end_dot_

 throughout the movie you see the action through the eyes of one of the partygoers who is taping the whole nightmare on digital video the downside of that blair witch style first person filming perspective is occasionally jumpy camera work and not always knowing exactly what s going on _meta_end_dot_

 you don t get to play the part of the omnipotent viewer who gets to see the big picture you re stuck seeing things through the eyes of one of the characters who know little more than what they see over the course of a few hours time _meta_end_dot_

 on the other hand this is an incredibly intense film _meta_end_dot_

 you have buildings collapsing people running for their lives massive firefights danger around every corner and a sense that the characters could die at any moment _meta_end_dot_

 combine that with likable realistic ordinary people wrenched from normalcy and thrown into a maelstrom of danger confusion and terror caused by a freaky looking indestructible monster that dwarfs the statue of liberty and you have the best movie i have seen since _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_
