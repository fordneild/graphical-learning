  here s the latest from the cult of man made global warming alarmism the daily mail reports on women and couples who have either aborted their babies in the name of reducing their carbon footprint or opted to be sterilized in order to prevent bringing a baby into the world who would do nothing but unnecessarily suck up valuable natural resources had toni vernelli gone ahead with her pregnancy ten years ago she would know at first hand what it is like to cradle her own baby to have a pair of innocent eyes gazing up at her with unconditional love to feel a little hand slipping into hers and a voice calling her mummy _meta_end_dot_

 but the very thought makes her shudder with horror _meta_end_dot_

 because when toni terminated her pregnancy she did so in the firm belief she was helping to save the planet _meta_end_dot_

 incredibly so determined was she that the terrible mistake of pregnancy should never happen again that she begged the doctor who performed the abortion to sterilise her at the same time _meta_end_dot_

 he refused but toni who works for an environmental charity relentlessly hunted down a doctor who would perform the irreversible surgery _meta_end_dot_

 finally eight years ago toni got her way _meta_end_dot_

 at the age of _meta_number_ref_ this young woman at the height of her reproductive years was sterilised to protect the planet _meta_end_dot_

 incredibly instead of mourning the loss of a family that never was her boyfriend now husband presented her with a congratulations card _meta_end_dot_

 while some might think it strange to celebrate the reversal of nature and denial of motherhood toni relishes her decision with an almost religious zeal _meta_end_dot_

 having children is selfish _meta_end_dot_

 it s all about maintaining your genetic line at the expense of the planet says toni _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 when sarah irving _meta_number_ref_ was a teenager she sat down and wrote a wish list for the future _meta_end_dot_

 most young girls dream of marriage and babies _meta_end_dot_

 but sarah dreamed of helping the environment and as she agonised over the perils of climate change the loss of animal species and destruction of wilderness she came to the extraordinary decision never to have a child _meta_end_dot_

 i realised then that a baby would pollute the planet and that never having a child was the most environmentally friendly thing i could do sarah s boyfriends have been less understanding than toni s with the breakdown of several relationships _meta_end_dot_

 i ve had boyfriends who wanted children so i knew i couldn t be with them long term says sarah _meta_end_dot_

 i ve had to break up with a couple of boyfriends because i didn t think it was fair to waste their time _meta_end_dot_

 in my early _meta_number_ref_s i had a boyfriend who i really liked but he wanted to start a family as soon as possible _meta_end_dot_

 i was tempted to stay with him and hope he would change his mind but i knew i couldn t provide him with what he wanted so i walked away sarah started work for the ethical consumer magazine and seven years ago she met her fianc mark hudson a _meta_number_ref_ year old health care worker _meta_end_dot_

 when they started dating in _meta_number_ref_ they immediately discussed their views on children _meta_end_dot_

 to my relief mark was as adamant as me that he didn t want a family _meta_end_dot_

 after a year of dating we started talking about sterilisation says sarah _meta_end_dot_

 i didn t want to have an accident if contraception didn t work we would be faced with the dilemma of whether to keep the baby while other young couples sit down and discuss mortgages sarah and mark discussed the medical options for one or the other to be sterilised _meta_end_dot_

 we realised it was a much more straightforward procedure safer and easier for a man to be sterilised through a vasectomy than a woman to be sterilised says sarah _meta_end_dot_

 in january _meta_number_ref_ mark had a vasectomy and we both felt incredibly relieved there was no chance of us having a baby ironically the couple who have decided to deny themselves children for the sake of the planet actively enjoy the company of young children _meta_end_dot_

 sarah says we both have nieces who we love dearly and i consider myself a caring nurturing person _meta_end_dot_

 hey if these women and men want to make it so that there s no chance they ll ever have children that s fine by me as it means at least as far as that part of their family goes there wil be one less generation of idiots we ll have to listen to but when it comes to the idea of aborting a baby supposedly for the sake of the environment we see once again in action the selfish intentions of so called caring individuals who view human life as nothing more than a parasite on themselves as well as the environment _meta_end_dot_

 i wonder if these morally bankrupt morons ever thanked their lucky stars that their parents didn t view them as a hindrance to a healthy environment _meta_end_question_

 hat tip to rosslyn smith at the american thinker who also writes about yet another instance of global warming hypocrisy from the usual suspects along those same lines comes this release out of bali that the airport there is expecting so many private jets for the upcoming un climate change conference that local officials will be making most attendees ferry their planes to four other airports in the region for parking as the local airport can only accommodate _meta_number_ref_ planes _meta_end_dot_

 the closest airport to provide parking space for such jets is about _meta_number_ref_ miles away the furthest about _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 i wonder how the projected future carbon footprint of the infant one of the women in the daily mail article aborted in order to protect the planet compares to that of deadheading a fleet of jets from bali to jakarta and back again _meta_end_question_

 and i wonder where the hell the outrage is over this excessive use of our natural resources by the very people who claim to care the most about the carbon footprint we leave for future generations _meta_end_question_

 probably buried with all the rest of the unanswered for hypocrisy that has come from the likes of uber greenies al gore john edwards and senator john kerry among other gw stormtroopers _meta_end_dot_

 the sf chronicle reported earlier this month that the bay area air quality management district is considering a ban on the use of _meta_end_dot_

 residential fireplaces it would be illegal to use residential fireplaces on nights with poor air quality under a rule being considered by bay area air regulators _meta_end_dot_

 over the next three weeks the bay area air quality management district will hold workshops to gauge public opinion on the proposal which would follow similar bans in sacramento county the san joaquin valley and such bay area cities as mill valley where people who disobey the city s wood burning law are already subject to stiff fines _meta_end_dot_

 spurred by growing evidence that shows smoke from wood burning is as bad or worse than smoke from cigarettes the bay area air quality management district is trying to reduce the amount of harmful particulate matter that people breathe _meta_end_dot_

 children the elderly and those with respiratory illnesses are particularly susceptible to smoke particles that emanate from wood burning fireplaces _meta_end_dot_

 the minute particles which enter nasal passages and lungs can cause asthma bronchitis lung disease and heart disease according to health experts _meta_end_dot_

 the workshops which start wednesday in oakland are designed to solicit comments and explain the proposed regulation which would cover wood burning stoves as well as indoor and outdoor fireplaces _meta_end_dot_

 on days in the bay area when particulate matter is at its worst wood burning is the greatest contributing factor accounting for _meta_number_ref_ percent of the pollution according to the air district _meta_end_dot_

 the problem is especially acute in winter when fire place use is high _meta_end_dot_

 last year the environmental protection agency strengthened its particulate standards reducing by almost half the amount of such particles that can be released into the air _meta_end_dot_

 in the past _meta_number_ref_ years a growing number of bay area cities including oakland union city fremont and los gatos have limited wood burning devices _meta_end_dot_

 in mill valley first time violators are warned before facing a _meta_dollor_ref_ fine _meta_end_dot_

 air district spokesman karen schkolnick said the bay area district s wood burning law would mirror the regulations used in sacramento and the san joaquin valley _meta_end_dot_

 during the _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ winter the san joaquin air pollution control district which covers san joaquin stanislaus merced madera fresno kings and tulare counties as well as part of kern county issued _meta_number_ref_ tickets to residents _meta_end_dot_

 the first fine is _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 repeated violations can lead to fines of between _meta_dollor_ref_ and _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ district spokeswoman jaime holt said _meta_end_dot_

 in lieu of paying a fine first time violators can attend a two hour residential wood burning compliance school where they learn about the pollution hazards of wood burning holt said _meta_end_dot_

 most violators in the san joaquin valley are initially reported by concerned neighbors holt said _meta_end_dot_

 i swear you cannot make this stuff up _meta_end_dot_

 most people burn their wood burning fireplaces as either their sole source of heat or as an additional source of heat so as not to have a sky high electric bill _meta_end_dot_

 so you d think that it would be a good thing that people are utilizing wood burning fireplaces because using gas and or electricity as a source of heat supposedly increases the size of your carbon footprint but in the bay area it seems that you just can t win _meta_end_dot_

 lastly in semi related news bush ally john howard has been voted out as australia s pm to be replaced by the eco friendly kevin rudd whose labour party was swept into power in this weekend s australia elections effectively ending nearly _meta_number_ref_ years of conservative rule _meta_end_dot_

 the ap reports that rudd has already made gw a top priority sydney australia australia s prime minister elect kevin rudd took advice sunday on how to ratify the kyoto protocol on cutting greenhouse gas emissions and fielded phone calls from world leaders starting in on work the day after a sweeping election victory _meta_end_dot_

 the emphatic victory for rudd s labor party swings australia toward the political left after almost _meta_number_ref_ years of conservative rule and puts it at odds with key ally washington on two crucial policy issues iraq and global warming _meta_end_dot_

 after declaring victory late saturday rudd attended church sunday then held meetings with government officials about the mechanics of signing the kyoto pact on global warming an issue he made his top priority during the election campaign _meta_end_dot_

 britain new zealand and indonesia said rudd s election would boost international efforts to address climate change _meta_end_dot_

 ousted prime minister john howard had refused to sign kyoto _meta_end_dot_

 aussie blogger tim blair notes that the media fawning over rudd has already begun _meta_end_dot_

 time magazine does its part here _meta_end_dot_
