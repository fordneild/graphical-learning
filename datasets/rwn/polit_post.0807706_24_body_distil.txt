  sure i could have taken the easy way out and pointed out the numerous kossacks defending jeremiah wright saying god d mn america but i dug a little deeper and came up with this shining example of america hating liberalism from daily kos diarist professorfate the united states needs to be invaded not just invaded occupied _meta_end_dot_

 we have allowed a congress and an administration to encourage hate and to hi jack our compassion _meta_end_dot_

 in fact as a nation we have lost our compassion _meta_end_dot_

 unfortunately america is at a point that to be able to really feel again to regain that compassion it needs to be invaded and occupied in the same way that we have invaded and occupied iraq _meta_end_dot_

 then there might be a greater chance that americans will be more reluctant to accept the invasion of another country _meta_end_dot_

 maybe seeing and feeling the same level of destruction that we have inflicted on iraq at least the american public will understand why invading another country is unconscionable except in the most dire circumstances which means after that country has directly attacked the united states _meta_end_dot_

 and that has not happened since world war ii _meta_end_dot_

 this is liberal patriotism at its finest _meta_end_dot_

 you can distinguish it from real patriotism because even though the people who say this sort of thing claim to love their country they re saying exactly the sort of things you d typically expect to hear from america s worst enemies _meta_end_dot_
