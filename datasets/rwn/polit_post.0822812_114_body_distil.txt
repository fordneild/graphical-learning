  there s one thing and just one thing that i admire about jerome corsi that is his genius for self promotion _meta_end_dot_

 he was involved with the swift boat vets which created an electoral earthquake during the _meta_number_ref_ election his was the primary guy behind the north american union hoax which was much discussed and now he has the _meta_number_ref_ book in the country the obama nation leftist politics and the cult of personality _meta_end_dot_

 for that i applaud him _meta_end_dot_

 however there is one enormous problem with jerome corsi he s a habitually dishonest buffoon who will say absolutely anything to make a buck _meta_end_dot_

 he s the right s michael moore except that michael moore has much more talent and certain boundaries beyond which even he won t go _meta_end_dot_

 corsi on the other hand would probably write aliens in charge at _meta_number_ref_ pennsylvania avenue if he thought he could make a few bucks off it _meta_end_dot_

 keep in mind folks this is the same lunatic who has been running around for years telling people that george bush is going to somehow personally merge the us canada and mexico over the objections of the american people and congress _meta_end_dot_

 in other words jerome corsi is a conspiracy nut whose credibility level is zero _meta_end_dot_

 just to hammer home the point let me post a few previous jerome corsi quotes and after reading them you tell me how much trust you can have in any research he has done on barack obama why doesn t president bush just tell the truth _meta_end_question_

 his secret agenda is to dissolve the united states of america into the north american union if president bush had run openly in _meta_number_ref_ on the proposition that a prime objective of his second term was to form the north american union and to supplant the dollar with the amero we doubt very much that president bush would have carried ohio let alone half of the red state majority he needed to win re election unless something is done the north american union will become a reality in _meta_number_ref_ as planned oh yeah let s put this embarrassing nutjob on point in the attack against barack obama what could go wrong _meta_end_question_
