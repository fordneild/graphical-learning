  it goes without saying that the gop is taking a dreadful thrashing right now _meta_end_dot_

 conservatives are unmotivated democrats are obliterating republicans in the fundraising arena and the gop s poll numbers have dropped off a cliff _meta_end_dot_

 george bush the face of the republican party has an approval rating of _meta_percent_ref_ and according to rasmussen reports one of the best polling agencies in the business _meta_number_ref_ _meta_percent_ref_ of americans consider themselves to be democrats while only _meta_number_ref_ _meta_percent_ref_ say they are republicans _meta_end_dot_

 worse yet voters trust the democrats more than republicans on the economy government ethics the war in iraq health care social security education immigration and abortion _meta_end_dot_

 yes the gop still has an edge on taxes and national security but how are republicans going to compete in _meta_number_ref_ if they cede all those other issues to the dems _meta_end_question_

 that s something republicans in congress are just going to have to figure out _meta_end_dot_

 how do you win elections when your supporters are unenthusiastic people are sick of your political party and money is in short supply _meta_end_question_

 unfortunately in _meta_number_ref_ the answer was you don t in _meta_number_ref_ republicans lost _meta_number_ref_ seats in the senate and _meta_number_ref_ seats in the house _meta_end_dot_

 although it s far too early to say for sure judging by the direction the political winds are blowing it wouldn t be the least bit surprising if the gop loses another _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ seats in the senate and an additional _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ house seats this time around _meta_end_dot_

 so why does the gop seem to be trapped in this recurring political nightmare _meta_end_question_

 there are a plethora of different reasons for it the war in iraq gas prices a soft economy george bush s lack of communication skills corruption scandals the illegal immigration brouhaha nominee john mccain out of control spending you can go on and on _meta_end_dot_

 however there is one overriding problem that dwarfs all the others a problem that few people in the leadership of the republican party seem to have come to grips with _meta_end_dot_

 that problem is that conservatives who are the heart and soul of the republican party no longer believe that the gop has their best interests at heart _meta_end_dot_

 that s not to say that there s no difference between the two parties because there is _meta_end_dot_

 that s not to say that the country would be better off if john mccain loses it most certainly wouldn t be _meta_end_dot_

 that s not to say that the republican party isn t more conservative than the democratic party without question it is _meta_end_dot_

 that being said does the republican party adequately represent conservative interests _meta_end_question_

 no _meta_end_dot_

 do george bush and john mccain s values and beliefs match up well with those of the average conservative in the party _meta_end_question_

 no they do not _meta_end_dot_

 does the machinery of the republican party the rnc the nrcc nscc treat conservatives fairly and do a good job of representing conservative interests _meta_end_question_

 not at all _meta_end_dot_

 in other words to many conservatives the republican party has ceased to be an organization that serves their interests and has become merely an allied organization that shares many but not all of the same critical goals _meta_end_dot_

 that may seem like a small distinction but it s an important one _meta_end_dot_

 conservatives will stay up late volunteering for a campaign give until it hurts and crawl over broken glass to put candidates in washington who re on their side in other words the attitude towards the gop has become he may be a son of a b tch but he s my son of a b tch that s what today s republican party is to most conservatives our sons of b tches _meta_end_dot_

 which brings us as conversations of this sort usually do back to reagan _meta_end_dot_

 why did conservatives love reagan _meta_end_question_

 certainly he was a great president but he departed from the conservative orthodoxy on more than a few occasions _meta_end_dot_

 reagan signed an abortion bill when he was governor of california the debt exploded under his watch he raised taxes he signed an amnesty bill and iran contra was certainly a big scandal _meta_end_dot_

 yet conservatives who were just as serious about their principles back then as they are today supported him ferociously when he was in office and revere the man s memory _meta_end_dot_

 why _meta_end_question_

 simple because there was never the slightest doubt in the minds of conservatives that ronald reagan shared their values and was doing everything within his power to use conservative principles to make our country a better place _meta_end_dot_

 so when reagan did something that conservatives disagreed with they figured he was just doing what he had to do for the sake of politics and didn t hold it against him _meta_end_dot_

 republicans today don t have that luxury because the assumptions that conservatives made about reagan have been reversed _meta_end_dot_

 if a republican does something that pleases conservatives they often assume that it is being done for political purposes while deviations from the conservative norm represent what republicans really want to do _meta_end_dot_
