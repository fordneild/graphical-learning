  early morning thought will those on the port side accuse obama of going to iraq for a photo op _meta_end_question_

 iht media stars will accompany obama overseas senator john mccain s trip to iraq last spring was a low key affair with his ordinary retinue of reporters following him abroad the nbc news anchor brian williams reported on his arrival in baghdad from new york with just two sentences tacked onto the in other political news portion of his newscast _meta_end_dot_

 but when obama heads for iraq and other locations overseas this summer williams is planning to catch up with him in person as are the other two evening news anchors charles gibson of abc and katie couric of cbs who like williams are far along in discussions to interview obama on successive nights _meta_end_dot_

 and while the anchors are jockeying for interviews with obama at stops along his route the regulars on the obama campaign plane will have new seat mates star political reporters from the major newspapers and magazines who are flocking to catch obama s first overseas trip since becoming the presumptive nominee of his party _meta_end_dot_

 i wonder if obama will have any time to meet with the commanders and troops on the ground _meta_end_question_

 will he have some preconditions to meet with general patreaus _meta_end_question_

 how many photos will they have that make it look like he is wearing a halo _meta_end_question_

 will katie couric ask obama what s on his ipod _meta_end_question_

 will barry find time to talk to the insurgents the extraordinary coverage of obama s trip reflects how the candidate remains an object of fascination in the news media a built in feature of being the first african american presidential nominee for a major political party and a relative newcomer to the national stage _meta_end_dot_

 well not completely _meta_end_dot_

 if it was hillary or biden or dodd or any of the other myriad democrats who were the presumptive nominee the media would be fawning virtually the same way _meta_end_dot_

 interestingly the international herald tribune discusses something most media outlets won t the appearance of massive bias in the media towards barry _meta_end_dot_

 all in all how pompous will this trip make obama look _meta_end_question_
