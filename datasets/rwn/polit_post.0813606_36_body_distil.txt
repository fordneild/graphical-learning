  clearly some sizable portion of the republican base is less than thrilled with mccain as their nominee _meta_end_dot_

 ironically in this context they face this choice partly because the social conservative vote was split among many candidates most prominently mitt romney and mike huckabee allowing the moderate mccain to win _meta_end_dot_

 regardless however only mccain and obama are plausible winners in november _meta_end_dot_

 barring tragic circumstances one of them will be our next president _meta_end_dot_

 it s therefore irrelevant if one would actually prefer some third alternative _meta_end_dot_

 the only way it makes sense then to vote for a bob barr or alan keyes or ralph nader or some other person who will not be our next president is if you honestly have no preference whatsoever as to whether mccain or obama prevails _meta_end_dot_

 otherwise even if it s a _meta_number_ref_ percent hold your nose difference you should vote for that guy james joyner
