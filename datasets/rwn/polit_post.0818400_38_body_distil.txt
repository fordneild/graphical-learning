  wrangling imagine that in a report to new york governor david paterson mr ward said the schedule and cost estimates of the rebuilding effort that have been communicated to the public are not realistic he said developers and government agencies would set new clear and achievable timelines by the end of september _meta_end_dot_

 mr ward said the earliest rebuilding estimates in the wake of the _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ attacks were not truthful referring to them as emotional dates _meta_end_dot_

 my initial response to the twin towers going down was that we should rebuild as quickly as possible _meta_end_dot_

 get it done and show the world what america is made of tough stuff _meta_end_dot_

 nothing keeps us down and all that _meta_end_dot_

 given that the left operates like _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ didn t happen and ignores the consequences of unchecked islamofascism and feels the threat is exaggerated see here here or just watch cnn a huge dirt hole seems to be an appropriate reminder _meta_end_dot_

 put up _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ markers where the people died and be done with it _meta_end_dot_

 let every person look and ponder what happens when bad ideologies triumph at least temporarily _meta_end_dot_

 as an added bonus there should be flat screens replaying the towers going down with video of our soldiers hunting and killing terrorist scum _meta_end_dot_

 it s raw i know but there s a simple elegance to my plan don t you think _meta_end_question_

 as an added bonus it s cost effective _meta_end_dot_

 updated rachel lucas reminds us why we need constant reminders of the consequences of islamofascism dear britain the more you apologize for stupid shit like this the more you will be apologizing in the future for ever more innocuous offenses you will never be done with it you will never be able to satisfy these people until you utterly bend to their will and you will apologize yourselves right into cultural oblivion as islam slowly but very very surely mows you down with its outrage and your proclivity to be doormats _meta_end_dot_

 very impressive _meta_end_dot_

 your dead and dying grandfathers and grandmothers who stood up to the last set of fascist assholes when most of your neighbors didn t they must be so proud _meta_end_dot_

 dirt _meta_end_dot_

 pit _meta_end_dot_

 we need the reminders _meta_end_dot_
