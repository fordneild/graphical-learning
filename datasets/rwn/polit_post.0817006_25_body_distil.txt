  when last we left you the king of green al gore was using _meta_number_ref_ times more electricity in his home compared to the average household _meta_end_dot_

 in fact the tennessee center for policy research reported in february of _meta_number_ref_ that gore s mansion _meta_number_ref_ room eight bathroom located in the posh belle meade area of nashville consumes more electricity every month than the average american household uses in an entire year according to the nashville electric service nes naturally gore responded indignantly without really addressing the core charge made by the tcpr _meta_end_dot_

 with that in mind it ll be interesting to see how if when he responds to their latest report nashville in the year since al gore took steps to make his home more energy efficient the former vice president s home energy use surged more than _meta_percent_ref_ according to the tennessee center for policy research _meta_end_dot_

 a man s commitment to his beliefs is best measured by what he does behind the closed doors of his own home said drew johnson president of the tennessee center for policy research _meta_end_dot_

 al gore is a hypocrite and a fraud when it comes to his commitment to the environment judging by his home energy consumption in the past year gore s home burned through _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ kilowatt hours kwh of electricity enough to power _meta_number_ref_ average american households for a month _meta_end_dot_

 in february _meta_number_ref_ an inconvenient truth a film based on a climate change speech developed by gore won an academy award for best documentary feature _meta_end_dot_

 the next day the tennessee center for policy research uncovered that gore s nashville home guzzled _meta_number_ref_ times more electricity than the average american household _meta_end_dot_

 after the tennessee center for policy research exposed gore s massive home energy use the former vice president scurried to make his home more energy efficient _meta_end_dot_

 despite adding solar panels installing a geothermal system replacing existing light bulbs with more efficient models and overhauling the home s windows and ductwork gore now consumes more electricity than before the green overhaul _meta_end_dot_

 since taking steps to make his home more environmentally friendly last june gore devours an average of _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ kwh per month _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ kwh more energy per month than before the renovations at a cost of _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 by comparison the average american household consumes _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ kwh in an entire year according to the energy information administration _meta_end_dot_

 ya know there s nothing wrong with wanting to go green in fact i use many green cleaning products around my house and signed on the first year i worked at the _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ with the county s recycling service where they come and pick up scrap and discarded paper used by businesses _meta_end_dot_

 i make sure the lights in the occupied offices are turned off when the occupant leaves for a meeting or for the day _meta_end_dot_

 some of my appliances are energy star compliant _meta_end_dot_

 i m considering starting to use those reusable grocery bags that are becoming so fashionable i have way too many plastic grocery bags as it is _meta_end_dot_

 that said i don t consistently recycle here at the house and don t go out of my way to not drive _meta_end_dot_

 i am not obsessive at all about any of this stuff _meta_end_dot_

 i just think conserving in general is a good idea after all who wants to be wasteful _meta_end_question_

 now if only i could effectively apply that when it comes to spending money _meta_end_dot_

 what i object to the most about the green brigade s fanaticism is the fact that many prominent greenies are flaming hypocrites like gore _meta_end_dot_

 they ll tell you to go buy a hybrid but it s not uncommon to see them driving around town in an suv or flying across the world in a jumbo jet _meta_end_dot_

 not only that but i get sick of these people trying to make others feel guilty for drinking out of a plastic bottle versus drinking water from a glass and am irked by people preaching to others that we re all gonna die soon if we don t throw our cans in the recycling bin _meta_end_dot_

 i also get sick of my opinion on gw being dismissed as though i m a conspiracy theorist world is flat type _meta_end_dot_

 also clearly there s no desire from the other side for serious healthy debate on this issue _meta_end_dot_

 it s their way or no way _meta_end_dot_

 in some cases green fanatics have argued that skeptics be punished in various ways in ways that would harm their career or worse ruin their lives nuremburg style trials anyone _meta_end_dot_

 the green fanatics in congress want to mandate what kind of light bulb you get to use _meta_end_dot_

 screw that _meta_end_dot_

 i could go on and on _meta_end_dot_

 funny thing is most of the conservatives i talk to take the same approach to going green as i do they don t go overboard with it but they conserve for conserving s sake and use certain green products because they work better and or smell better and they drive fuel efficient cars because it saves them money at the pump money they d like to use on a big steak dinner or a trip to australia _meta_end_dot_

 but to knee jerk green fanatics because skeptics are well skeptical of their claims and don t believe there is a consensus on the cause of gw automatically those skeptics are branded as heretics who want to destroy the earth whatever _meta_end_dot_

 as far as green policy goes i m pretty much with newt gingrich s mindset on it except for his appearance in that we ad with nancy pelosi yikes _meta_end_dot_

 i think he realizes that the whole global warming issue is not going to go away and understands that thanks a great deal to untruthful global warming alarmists like gore and media outlets who eagerly parrot what he and other experts have to say on gw conservatives will be forever be left behind on the issue rather than being seen as a constructive part of it so he s proposed free market alternatives to their big gov t solutions his attitude seems to be well ok if this is how the masses want to view global warming and that is as a crisis then let the fixes for the so called crisis primarily come from the free market and private sector _meta_end_dot_

 i ve read elsewhere at a few other conservative blogs the opinion that gingrich has sold out and become part of the enviro nut movement but if you read more at his site and from his book real change you ll see that that s far from the truth _meta_end_dot_

 other conservatives may disagree with me on this but thankfully on the green issue i ve found that conservatives are able to debate each other constructively on the issue where as on the far left end they don t want debate _meta_end_dot_

 they just want to dominate it _meta_end_dot_
