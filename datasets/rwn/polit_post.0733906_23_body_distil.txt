  the philadelphia inquirer reports today today that the lehigh valley ironpigs decided to change the name of their mascot to something less offensive due to outrage over the nickname porkchop by a hispanic group just two days after naming its mascot porkchop the philadelphia phillies new minor league franchise dropped the nickname after getting complaints from hispanics that it was offensive _meta_end_dot_

 the lehigh valley ironpigs whose mascot is a giant fuzzy pig had chosen porkchop from more than _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ fan entries _meta_end_dot_

 the team announced monday that the mascot will now be dubbed ferrous general manager kurt landes said he heard from several hispanics who said porkchop was derogatory _meta_end_dot_

 we were really unaware of any negative connotations with the word pork chop he said _meta_end_dot_

 if it offended a few it s a few too many guillermo lopez vice president of the latino leadership alliance said he was called pork chop when he worked at bethlehem steel decades ago _meta_end_dot_

 if my parents were alive they d be having fits said lopez among those who complained to the team _meta_end_dot_

 it meant much more to them than it does to puerto ricans now in the lehigh valley the ironpig s new nickname ferrous comes from the latin word ferrum which means relating to or containing iron _meta_end_dot_

 ferrous was the most popular submission in the name the mascot competition _meta_end_dot_

 the name received _meta_number_ref_ of the _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ suggestions _meta_end_dot_

 blogger grande pescados had this to say in response to the alleged derogatory nature of the term pork chop as well as to the complaints from lopez now i ve been called and know lots of deragatory terms for hispanics w tback fence jumper border hopper greaser beaner lupe but never in my life have i been called a pork chop and i know quite a few people that are walking wikipedias when it comes to racist terminology in high school it was sort of a pass time to rip on each other s ethnicity during lunch baseball games etc for coming from a small town i would say we were a rather tolerant and open group when it came to shredding each other racially _meta_end_dot_

 pork chop doesn t even make any edited st sense _meta_end_dot_

 people like guillermo lopez make me sick as an american with a hispanic mother and as a man _meta_end_dot_

 rather than take up causes that would truly make a difference he decides to get into a b tchy little slap fight over the name of a triple aaa baseball team _meta_end_dot_

 i guess all the real issues americans if hispanic descent have been solved if this is the only issue lopez can gin up to justify his paycheck _meta_end_dot_

 wfmz reports that ferrous is an unoriginal name for the ironpigs mascot as he shares his name with a minor league mascot in maryland _meta_end_dot_

 the team name _meta_end_question_

 the aberdeen ironbirds _meta_end_dot_

 poor thing just can t catch a break _meta_end_dot_
