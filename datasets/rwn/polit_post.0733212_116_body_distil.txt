  the liberal capacity for self delusion knows no bounds as evidenced by the george soros funded study that inspired john lott s latest column according to a brand new and extensively covered study by the jfa institute a george soros funded group the u s _meta_end_dot_

 prison system doesn t deter crime and is a costly and harmful failure prison is supposedly so useless that the u s _meta_end_dot_

 prison population could be cut in half with no effect on crime _meta_end_dot_

 this distrust of prison reducing crime is not new but many have a hard time believing the simplest rule of economics if you make something more costly people do less of it _meta_end_dot_

 people accept that this principle applies to what we buy in grocery stores but not to bad things that people might do _meta_end_dot_

 now john lott took the time to methodically tear apart the idea that harsh prison sentences and strict policing don t reduce crime but isn t it sort of pathetic that he had to take the time to do that _meta_end_question_

 the whole idea that handing out a long prison sentence for committing a crime won t reduce the number of people willing to commit that crime is so preposterous and so self evidently incorrect that only a liberal or a college professor could believe it _meta_end_dot_

 for example if the penalty for speeding were increased to _meta_number_ref_ years in jail starting tomorrow morning do you think it s more likely less likely or just as likely that you ll speed tomorrow afternoon _meta_end_question_

 team soros at the jfa institute would probably tell you it wouldn t make any difference but the rest of us know better _meta_end_dot_

 ps if you ve ever wondered how the left could ever believe communism would work or why they think that they can heap new taxes on the rich without seeing the wealthy change their behavior etc etc this level of obliviousness to human nature explains it _meta_end_dot_
