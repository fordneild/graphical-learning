  my buddy kit lange s blog euphoric reality has been hacked by someone claiming to be a muslim _meta_end_dot_

 here are some screen shots i haven t fully translated the arabic writing on there but i believe it says dirka dirka muhammad jihad my girlfriend is a goat and she has the prettiest eyes _meta_end_exclamation_

 dirka dirka in all seriousness i talked to kit about the hack and she has an alternate theory that may not be as out there as it s going to sound _meta_end_dot_

 you see kit has been doing a ground breaking series on the pendleton _meta_number_ref_ that features a lot of original reporting and information that some government agencies might not want out there _meta_end_dot_

 here are some excerpts published with permission from what kit told me on instant messenger last night kit i don t think it was really islamists john why not _meta_end_question_

 kit _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 they deleted two years of posts _meta_end_dot_

 not the whole database _meta_end_dot_

 i started writing about the pendleton _meta_number_ref_ two years ago this month _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 they deleted my entire userbase _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 the site was hacked at _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ pm the agencies on my site at the time were nist fema and the navy mc intranet information services network and at that time i had three different government agencies on my site _meta_end_dot_

 anything mentioning the pendleton _meta_number_ref_ on my site got wiped out _meta_end_dot_

 everything _meta_end_dot_

 kit ohhh don t forget to mention that in the last _meta_number_ref_ days my windows laptop has been attacked _meta_number_ref_ times with two formats necessary _meta_end_dot_

 long story short kit s not sure exactly who hacked her site and neither am i but when that pendleton _meta_number_ref_ story is back up and running make sure to check it out because it s entirely possible that someone went to a lot of trouble to try to prevent people from looking at it _meta_end_dot_
