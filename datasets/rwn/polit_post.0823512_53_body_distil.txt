  today you guys are going to settle an argument for me _meta_end_dot_

 it is my position that men should say the powerful words i love you first _meta_end_dot_

 men have a harder time saying those words than women do _meta_end_dot_

 more than that a woman can feel that she loves a guy but if the guy doesn t feel it and or won t say it the relationship is doomed anyway and a woman is wasting her breath _meta_end_dot_

 in addition men are conquerors _meta_end_dot_

 a woman saying the words first takes all the sport out of the hunt draining the guy of positive feelings he might have _meta_end_dot_

 a friend believes that women should say the words first because a guy saying them will scare her off _meta_end_dot_

 because the words mean so much to a guy a woman should say them first because it shows she is comfortable with the idea _meta_end_dot_

 a guy isn t bothered by the words as much _meta_end_dot_

 of course i disagree for the stated reasons above _meta_end_dot_

 plus this a guy who says i love you on date _meta_number_ref_ or _meta_number_ref_ is often trying to get into a girl s pants and that s a whole different kettle of fish _meta_end_dot_

 even then the words aren t scary they re revealing and can be amusing _meta_end_dot_

 what s scary is so many women buy the words in that situation but that s a problem for a different day _meta_end_dot_

 then there is this who should say the words first _meta_end_question_

 we all have theories but practice is what counts _meta_end_dot_

 who actually does say them first _meta_end_question_

 so what do you think _meta_end_question_

 who should say i love you first _meta_end_question_
