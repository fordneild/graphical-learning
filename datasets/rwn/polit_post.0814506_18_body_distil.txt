  i ve been pondering some of the posts at rwn this week and thinking about what conservatives have to be optimistic about _meta_end_dot_

 despite the fact that this year s presidential election features a far left democrat against a rino there are still plenty of reasons for hope _meta_end_dot_

 one of them is that despite concerted and extreme democratic party obstruction president bush has appointed hundreds of judges to the federal bench _meta_end_dot_

 i couldn t quickly find a current count if you can locate the figures please leave a comment but even as of _meta_number_ref_ months ago bush had appointed _meta_number_ref_ federal judges and justices who had been confirmed _meta_end_dot_

 even older statistiics from three years ago give you a feel for the number of currently sitting as of three years ago federal judges appointed by each president the number of sitting federal judges by president george w _meta_end_dot_

 bush _meta_number_ref_ increased to _meta_number_ref_ by_meta_number_ref_ months ago and higher today bill clinton _meta_number_ref_ george h w _meta_end_dot_

 bush _meta_number_ref_ ronald reagan _meta_number_ref_ jimmy carter _meta_number_ref_ gerald ford _meta_number_ref_ richard nixon _meta_number_ref_ lyndon johnson _meta_number_ref_ john f _meta_end_dot_

 kennedy _meta_number_ref_ as you recall john hawkins poll here earlier this week found that among visitors to rwn who responded putting in originalist supreme court justices was the second highest priority exceeded only by security at the border without amnesty _meta_end_dot_

 i myself agonized a bit over john s poll but ultimately picked the judges as the most important priority because all federal judges are appointed for life _meta_end_dot_

 that includes not only supreme court justices but federal appellate justices and trial court judges as well _meta_end_dot_

 that means that the potential impact of each judge extends for decades into the future _meta_end_dot_

 since federal judges are appointed for life walking into a federal courtroom has a very different feel to it than walking into most state courthouses _meta_end_dot_

 unlike state court judges who are aware that they will be standing for re election eventually federal judges don t particularly care what you think about their rulings although most do try to avoid creating reversible error since they are not fond of being reversed on appeal _meta_end_dot_

 what federal judges have the luxury of doing to a degree unheard of in most state courts is pursing their political philosophy year in and year out for decades aided by law clerks who help them craft orders findings and opinions that support their results _meta_end_dot_

 while the law is the law there is usually considerable wiggle room for a judge _meta_end_dot_

 a rasmussen poll reported this week found that for most republicans appointment of supreme court judges is the top priority for _meta_percent_ref_ of republicans second to the economy but more of a priority than the war in iraq _meta_end_dot_

 by the way another rasmussen poll found that the democratic presidential nominee obama or clinton currently leads in the electoral college over john mccain but not by a huge margin _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ given that federal judges have lifetime appointments should electing a president who will choose originalist federal judges be the absolute top priority _meta_end_question_

 well maybe _meta_end_dot_

 but priorities can change on a dime _meta_end_dot_

 if we saw another major al qaeda _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ style attack next week you can bet that eradicating al qaeda would rapidly climb to the top of the list of priorities for most americans _meta_end_dot_

 i ve always found setting priorities as well as setting generalized hierarchies of values to be a somewhat frustrating process anyway because i m aware that such lists are heavily influenced by what is currently scarce or abundant not necesarily what is most important in the abstract or for all time _meta_end_dot_

 for example my current top priority list does not include getting plenty of fresh air but if i accidentally inahaled a big chunk of steak getting a breath of fresh air would rapidly move to the top of my priority list _meta_end_dot_

 winning the iraq war isn t a top priority for conservatives at the moment because it s being handled satisfactorily for now thanks to the concerted efforts of america s troops on the ground officers generals and commander in chief _meta_end_dot_

 ditto for avoiding another al qaeda attack _meta_end_dot_

 so far so good _meta_end_dot_

 some areas that aren t being handled satisfactory at all right now are the economy illegal immigration and judges running amok _meta_end_dot_

 hence issues like these are at the top of the current priority list _meta_end_dot_

 yes i know some aspects of the economy are just fine _meta_end_dot_

 but fuel and food prices are rising rapidly and we ve seen the effects of a subprime mortgage crisis so clearly the economy is not all sunshine and daffodils what will become the top priorities for the right if barack obama becomes the next president or if john mccain is elected _meta_end_question_

 the priorities will depend on exactly which areas these gentlemen mess up first and which ones they mess up the worst _meta_end_dot_

 frankly i don t see either obama or mccain making any actual improvements over george w _meta_end_dot_

 bush with respect to any of the major issues we currently face do you _meta_end_question_

 i m not even sure half of obama s supporters really do _meta_end_dot_

 i think they just want a d behind the president s name again _meta_end_dot_

 under obama or mccain i see the prospect of numerous and varied new woes to be added to the ones we already have _meta_end_dot_

 if we re lucky the economy may improve with respect to fuel and food prices but simply due to the ordinary self correcting operation of the market _meta_end_dot_

 i do forsee painful times ahead but i also see opportunity because there are always opportunities _meta_end_dot_

 if the presidency and congress are controlled by well meaning destructive democrats there will still be opportunities to win races at the state and local level which in turn will help build grass roots support for the next run at congress and the white house _meta_end_dot_

 in the years ahead the right will have time to ruminate and ponder and something good will come of that _meta_end_dot_

 but at the same time it s crtiical to keep pushing forward _meta_end_dot_

 with enough patience even a raindrop can wear down a stone _meta_end_dot_

 and you re more than a raindrop aren t you _meta_end_question_

 if democrats are huge boulders in the stream of progress then the gathered force of the right is the rushing water that cannot be stopped and always finds another way _meta_end_dot_
