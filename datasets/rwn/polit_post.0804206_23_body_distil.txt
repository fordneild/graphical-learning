  a reliable source dumped a hot rumor in my lap at cpac but asked that i wait until monday to print it _meta_end_dot_

 the story _meta_end_question_

 john edwards is running for the senate in north carolina _meta_end_dot_

 if it turns out to be true remember where you heard it first _meta_end_dot_

 on thursday night i was hanging out at the reception with karol shenin from alarming news and she spots wayne lapierre the head of the national rifle association who she is in total awe of _meta_end_dot_

 so she pleads with me to go over with her and get her a picture _meta_end_dot_

 i am a little surprised just a bit anyway because karol is like the most personable person on earth and it s hard for me to imagine her being too shy to talk to anyone but still no worries i am happy to help out _meta_end_dot_

 so we wander over and lapierre is talking to some guy and chris cox the nra s executive director about whether they re going to endorse mccain _meta_end_dot_

 before i can say anything karol blurts something or another out and i start to laugh because i knew she wasn t as shy as she was pretending to be maybe _meta_end_dot_

 in the end i did have to ask him to let karol take a pic with him _meta_end_dot_

 anyway lapierre was talking about whether the nra was going to endorse mccain and while he didn t say they were for sure i got the impression that is going to come but and this is a big but he was really emphasizing that they had to be honest with their members to preserve their credibility which i took to mean that they were going to hammer mccain for mccain feingold which the nra really hated with a passion _meta_end_dot_

 i got to meet a lot of people that i didn t manage to get pics of during cpac _meta_end_dot_

 ken blackwell mark steyn pamela gellar kevin mccullough jed babbin wayne lapierre niger innis angela mcglowan amanda carpenter and jesse michelle malkin among others _meta_end_dot_

 if you are interested in meeting big name conservatives cpac is a great place to do it _meta_end_dot_

 i was also trying to get interviews with dinesh d souza jim demint g _meta_end_dot_

 gordon liddy and roy beck from numbersusa _meta_end_dot_

 unfortunately there was a lot of chaos at the event and i didn t end up hooking up for interviews with any of them _meta_end_dot_

 you ever seen those posters that post ugly liberal women and attractive conservative women _meta_end_question_

 well i ve always thought those posters were unfair and they well may be but i am not sure i have ever seen as many good looking women in one place as i did at cpac _meta_end_dot_

 not that every woman there was attractive but it was not the least bit unusual to have _meta_number_ref_ women walk by and not have a single one that was less than an _meta_number_ref_ out of _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 it would be interesting to go to the yearly kos sometime and see how the women measure up _meta_end_dot_

 i cannot say enough good things about kristina grabosky who played our gal friday to all the bloggers _meta_end_dot_

 she was one of the nicest most competent and hard working people i ve ever had the pleasure to deal with especially since putting up with a bunch of kvetching bloggers under less that ideal circumstances would try the patience of a saint _meta_end_dot_

 in the world of conservative punditry and blogging i m still a peon compared to the real rock stars of the movement _meta_end_dot_

 still i gotta tell you it is extremely cool to have someone come up to you and say oh wow you re john hawkins _meta_end_question_

 i ve been reading your blog for years and i m a big fan you get the emails and they re nice but there s just something awesome about having it happen in person _meta_end_dot_
