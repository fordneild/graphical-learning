  in my opinion the choice could not be more clear between one candidate john mccain who s had experience been tested in war and tried in peace another candidate who has not _meta_end_dot_

 between one candidate john mccain who has always put the country first worked across party lines to get things done and one candidate who has not _meta_end_dot_

 between one candidate who s a talker and the other candidate who s the leader america needs as our next president joe lieberman lieberman could have also added that we have a choice between one candidate who has always raised his hand for the national anthem and another who has not _meta_end_dot_

 we have a choice between one candidate who spent _meta_number_ref_ years in an anti american anti white church and another who did not _meta_end_dot_

 we have a choice between one candidate who made a big deal out of the fact that he didn t want to wear a flag pin and another candidate who did not _meta_end_dot_

 just pointing a few things out again because those are all relevant points people should keep in mind when they step into the voting booth _meta_end_dot_
