  it has been hard to escape the fact that the left has completely given up on the idea of a color blind america _meta_end_dot_

 the democratic party openly advocates discriminating against white americans via affirmative action and black democrats were voting for barack obama at a _meta_percent_ref_ clip by the end of the democratic primaries based on his race _meta_end_dot_

 now the word out is that colin powell is going to endorse barack obama _meta_end_dot_

 it hasn t happened yet and perhaps it won t but if it does why would it happen _meta_end_question_

 what are the chances that someone like colin powell would endorse let s say democratic candidate hillary clinton _meta_end_question_

 zero right _meta_end_question_

 so why would a prominent republican like colin powell who was a major player in the bush administration endorse barack obama _meta_end_question_

 despite what he may say there would be one reason for it and one reason only because he s black and he wants to support a black candidate _meta_end_dot_

 when we get to a point where even republicans are saying race is more important than ideology i fear for the future of this country and wonder if we re headed down the road towards the sort of tribalism that ruined so many countries around the world _meta_end_dot_
