  barack obama during an interview with george stephanopoulos let s not play games _meta_end_dot_

 i was suggesting you re absolutely right that john mccain has not talked about my muslim faith _meta_end_dot_

 i m of course not suggesting that obama actually meant that he s a muslim or that his statement was anything other than a misleading choice of words but we all know how the media would be reacting if someone else say president bush were to have said this _meta_end_dot_

 just imagine the front page headlines and features on late night television _meta_end_dot_

 remember when politics was simply about politics and not smearing one s opponent with pettiness and lies _meta_end_question_

 i don t _meta_end_dot_

 in this particular case i don t think this so called gaffe is even worth mentioning at all other than to point out the unabashed bias in the media of what is labeled a scandal blunder etc _meta_end_dot_

 if obama s error isn t newsworthy neither are the majority of supposed gaffes by politicians constantly hounded by reporters just waiting to pounce _meta_end_dot_

 fortunately for obama conservatives tend to be far less vindictive he ll slide past this statement just fine _meta_end_dot_

 because you know christians are constantly mistakenly referring to their muslim faith oops i couldn t resist _meta_end_dot_

 cross posted at conservatives with attitude _meta_end_exclamation_
