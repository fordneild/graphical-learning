  glenn reynolds says something i ve been thinking but i think that republicans should be careful about launching a cult of sarah palin _meta_end_dot_

 she s the v p _meta_end_dot_

 pick not the head of the ticket _meta_end_dot_

 she s still a relative newcomer to national politics _meta_end_dot_

 she s virtually sure to commit at least one major mistake between now and november _meta_end_dot_

 and yes i know i said this before she s the v p _meta_end_dot_

 pick not the head of the ticket _meta_end_dot_

 cults of personality are annoying _meta_end_dot_

 there is no politician that i ve idealized but i have to admit that the more i see of sarah palin s political positions philosophy and personal life the more i like her _meta_end_dot_

 the political class mccain included have been so out of touch with people in the hinterlands that they inevitably insult the people they ostensibly represent _meta_end_dot_

 sarah palin is not this politician _meta_end_dot_

 yet _meta_end_dot_

 will mccain receive her input _meta_end_question_

 i hope so _meta_end_dot_

 note to mccain _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 build a fence _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 stop the out of control spending _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 knock it off with the big government thing _meta_end_dot_

 my concern with the populace and with both campaigns obama s and mccain s is that everyone seems to be wanting to care for and be taken care of _meta_end_dot_

 where is the impulse to cut the government and cut entitlements and cut the fat _meta_end_question_

 where is the impulse to strengthen the military and strengthen the infrastructure and cut the rest _meta_end_question_

 sarah palin seems to have that impulse _meta_end_dot_

 and i wish john mccain had more of it _meta_end_dot_

 john mccain is at the top of the ticket _meta_end_dot_

 his choice of sarah palin as his running mate makes me appreciate his willingness to bend and hopefully on drilling in anwr _meta_end_dot_

 is her pick just throwing a bone to the base or is he actually able to be flexible _meta_end_question_

 time will tell _meta_end_dot_

 i still have concerns about john mccain _meta_end_dot_

 my fondness for palin doesn t change them _meta_end_dot_
