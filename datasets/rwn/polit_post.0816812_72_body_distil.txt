  unfortunately maria isabel the obama campaigner worker fond of displaying flags that feature communist executioner che guevara is not unique the moonbat above is lorain county ohio judge james burge _meta_end_dot_

 the picture accompanies a usa today story describing burge s opposition to ohio s lethal injection procedure on the grounds that it isn t quick and painless enough for murderers _meta_end_dot_

 as a fan of che guevara he no doubt feels that a bullet to the head is plenty quick and painless enough for counterrevolutionaries _meta_end_dot_

 guevara was fidel castro s chief executioner _meta_end_dot_

 every socialist dictatorship needs one _meta_end_dot_

 the nazis had heinrich himmler the soviets had felix dzerzhinsky the khmer rouge had honcho nuon chea _meta_end_dot_

 for some reason progressives chose guevara as the personification of the evil they embrace _meta_end_dot_

 maybe it s because che inspired them with lofty words like those below _meta_end_dot_

 dismissing the objections of a colleague who understood the importance of trials and proof go ahead and try them tomorrow morning but execute them now _meta_end_exclamation_

 from his motorcycle diaries which acolyte robert redford managed to edit into a cinematic hagiography crazy with fury i will stain my rifle red while slaughtering any enemy that falls in my hands _meta_end_exclamation_

 my nostrils dilate while savoring the acrid odor of gunpowder and blood _meta_end_dot_

 with the deaths of my enemies i prepare my being for the sacred fight and join the triumphant proletariat with a bestial howl _meta_end_exclamation_

 instructing his revolutionary tribunals we don t need proof to execute a man _meta_end_dot_

 we only need proof that it s necessary to execute him _meta_end_dot_

 a revolutionary must become a cold killing machine motivated by pure hate _meta_end_dot_

 from a letter to his father i d like to confess papa at that moment i discovered that i really like killing _meta_end_dot_

 summing up socialism after describing how he shot some poor helpless guy in the head at point blank range he went into convulsions for a while and was finally still _meta_end_dot_

 now his belongings were mine _meta_end_dot_

 to a _meta_number_ref_ year old boy just before he personally blew the kid s brains out for trying to defend his father who was also executed i said kneel down _meta_end_exclamation_

 the kid wouldn t kneel and had to be murdered standing up your average teenager walking around the shopping mall in a che t shirt is only doing it to be a brat _meta_end_dot_

 but adults who adulate such pure evil are fit subjects for an exorcism _meta_end_dot_

 the popularity of both che guevara and barack obama among the same moonbats indicates what the vague rhetoric about hope and change actually means _meta_end_dot_

 these sick freaks are hoping to change america into hell on earth _meta_end_dot_

 nonetheless they re morally superior because they think pricking a murderer with a needle is cruel and unusual punishment _meta_end_dot_

 che guevara is thankfully dead _meta_end_dot_

 but they ve still got obama _meta_end_dot_
