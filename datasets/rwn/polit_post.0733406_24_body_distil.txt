  question obviously i have definite opinions to keep asking this question but would really like your opinion on it would you prefer a balanced budget amendment or a line item veto amendment and why rtwingntcase answer a balanced budget amendment because it would force congress to work seriously to curb entitlement spending _meta_end_dot_

 the bridges to nowhere and liberace museums may be attention grabbers and are well worth killing via a line item veto amendment but the big programs like medicare medicaid and social security are the ones that have to be tamed to get the budget under control long term _meta_end_dot_

 a balanced budget amendment one that worked anyway would cause that to happen _meta_end_dot_

 a line item veto would be great to have as well but it wouldn t make as big of an impact _meta_end_dot_
