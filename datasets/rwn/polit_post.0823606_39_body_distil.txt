  well this should be a hoot _meta_end_exclamation_

 if obama has indeed picked joseph biden as his vice presidential running mate what a gift to punditry _meta_end_exclamation_

 let s see _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 biden s claims to fame include repeated plagiarism and being rude and condescending and being a bit of a gaffe machine and being prone to logorrhea or as put more succinctly as dr _meta_end_dot_

 melissa clouthier he s a bloviating self important wind bag biden also said that obama lacked the experience to be president and strongly opposed the iraq surge that worked claiming it would be a tragic mistake i wonder which of these traits attracted barack obama to biden _meta_end_question_

 does obama actually want to win this election what kind of a choice is joe biden it s the audacity of what the heck _meta_end_dot_

 yes i know joe biden has lots of pretend national security experience but it consists mainly of his chairmanship of the senate foreign relations committee the political spoils that go with being in the senate a long time and bunch of trips to iraq interspersed with shooting his mouth off in a semi random fashion _meta_end_dot_

 was obama not paying attention in _meta_number_ref_ when joe biden s presidential campaign went down in flames after he was caught plagiarizing a speech from british labor party leader neal kinnock and passing it off as his own does obama not care that biden s history of plagiarism date back to law school and he flunked a course for it_meta_beep_ref_ in _meta_number_ref_ biden plagiarized while writing a paper as a student at the syracuse university law school in a legal methods course which he failed because of that copied paper _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 in an article entitled biden s belly flop newsweek printed joe biden s yearbook picture from his college days and a copy of his law school transcripts with the big f in his transcripts circled _meta_end_dot_

 biden was given a chance to repeat his legal methods course and above the f his retake grade of _meta_percent_ref_ was eventually penciled in _meta_end_dot_

 being a repeat offender when it came to plagiarism made things much much worse for biden than they might have been otherwise in his failed bid for the democratic presidential ticket in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 senator biden s plagiarism of a speech by british labor party leader neal kinnock took place at a campaign stump at the iowa state fairgrounds _meta_end_dot_

 in closing his speech biden took kinnock s ideas and language as if they were his very own inspired thoughts prefacing kinnock s ideas with the phrase i started thinking as i was coming over here _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 little did biden suspect that video footage of this speech would be spliced together with footage of kinnock s speech in an attack video which would be distributed by members of the dukakis campaign _meta_end_dot_

 making the headline news in the new york times and the evening news on tv the video was a stab in the back for biden by his democratic competitor and although he insisted that i m in this race to stay _meta_end_dot_

 i m in this race to win the resulting publicity surrounding his unacknowledged use of neal kinnock s speech was what eventually forced him out of the race _meta_end_dot_

 name recognition was no longer a problem for biden but not the kind of name recognition which would assist his campaign for the democratic presidential nomination _meta_end_dot_

 his name was now a byword for plagiarism _meta_end_dot_

 his situation became a classic example of plagiarism for high school teachers and college instructors across the nation lecturing on the evils of unacknowledged source use _meta_end_dot_

 biden initially denied any wrongdoing claiming that this was just an inadvertent lack of acknowledgement _meta_end_dot_

 yet there were other instances of rhetorical borrowing from speeches made by robert f _meta_end_dot_

 kennedy and hubert humphrey _meta_end_dot_

 and the fact that biden had given other speeches using the kinnock passages without acknowledgment suggested that the lifting was more than just an inadvertent oversight _meta_end_dot_

 here s more biden also released at the same time the record of his grades as an undergraduate which were c s and d s with the exception of two a s in physical education one b in a course on english writers and an f in rotc during his first three semesters _meta_end_dot_

 his grades improved later in his undergraduate career but were not exceptional _meta_end_dot_

 further when questioned by a new hampshire resident about his grades in law school biden had claimed falsely to have graduated in the top half of his class when he actually graduated _meta_number_ref_th in a class of _meta_number_ref_ that he had attended on a full scholarship and had received three degrees in fact he had received a single b a _meta_end_dot_

 in history and political science and a half scholarship based on financial need _meta_end_dot_

 i m curious what it takes to get an f in rotc _meta_end_dot_

 that s a special claim to fame _meta_end_exclamation_

 i ve never been a fan of biden aside from his history of plagiarism biden has a notably poor temperament _meta_end_dot_

 as i ve written to me biden is an irritating combination of a mental lightweight attempting to conceal the fact and a bully probably the too are related i did enjoy this passage from peggy noonan s latest column the great thing about joe biden during the alito hearings the reason he is to me actually endearing is that as he speaks as he goes on and on and spins his long statements hypotheticals and free associations as he demonstrates yet again as he did in the roberts hearings and even the thomas hearings that he is incapable of staying on the river of a thought and is constantly lured down tributaries from which he can never quite work his way back you can see him batting the little paddles of his mind against the weeds trying desperately to return to the river but not remembering where it is or where it was going _meta_end_dot_

 i love him _meta_end_dot_

 he s human like a garrulous uncle after a drink i m not sure whether peggy noonan remembers the endearing way that senator biden addressed supreme court chief justice roberts during his recent confirmation hearing rush limbaugh s website has the audio from the same roberts hearing the senator couldn t seem to dignify judge roberts with his name it was judge instead of judge roberts unless it was judge judge or man as in well i hope you don t still hold that view man the disrespectful tone was gratuitous and palpable and that s hard for me to respect _meta_end_dot_

 sure biden s natural rudeness will make him a useful attack dog for obama but that comes at price _meta_end_dot_

 this will be increasingly funny as the campaign progresses biden has been too loose and independent for too long i question his ability to put a sock in it his selection will come back to haunt the campaign _meta_end_dot_
