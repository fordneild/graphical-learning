  fear not true believers because the minions of the goreacle have come up with another brilliant new forward thinking solution to the scourge of manmade global warming horses _meta_end_exclamation_

 no really horses _meta_end_exclamation_

 from the independent the horse is this the secret weapon to beat global warming _meta_end_question_

 the french are mounting a transport revolution led by the humble horse using it in more than _meta_number_ref_ towns to pull schoolbuses and to collect refuse more than _meta_number_ref_ french towns have already gone back to the future by introducing horse drawn carriages to replace petrol and diesel powered vehicles for local tasks such as collecting rubbish street cleaning and taking children to school _meta_end_dot_

 and at least _meta_number_ref_ more are set to join the revolution next year _meta_end_dot_

 the revival of horse power is being pushed by the french national stud that s not david ginola or even president nicolas sarkozy but an organisation set up four centuries ago by the sun king louis xiv to supply horses for his military campaigns _meta_end_dot_

 last week it told france s annual conference of mayors that gee gees were a serious alternative to the gas guzzler as municipalities seek to cut their emissions of carbon dioxide the main cause of global warming _meta_end_dot_

 though studies have yet to be completed promoters say the carriages are particularly good for the environment when used for work that involves lots of stops and starts over short distances _meta_end_dot_

 critics counter that the horse which produces around _meta_number_ref_ kilos of dung daily enough to fill a suitcase is hardly pollution free _meta_end_dot_

 they point out that before the advent of the car environmentalists were seriously worried that a proliferation of horses would leave cities knee deep in merde and that new york had grave difficulty in disposing of some _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ equine carcasses a year _meta_end_dot_

 but stephane de veyrac of the national stud was undaunted _meta_end_dot_

 it s about sustainable development and bringing some humanity back to today s monotonous machine driven jobs he said so horses are going to be our secret weapon to beat global warming if so on the upside a lot of little girls are going to be thrilled because they re getting ponies for christmas _meta_end_exclamation_

 on the downside you re going to have to build a barn feed your transportation and spend your week ends shoveling horse crap but at least when al gore looks down on streets filled with horses while he s criss crossing the world in his private jet it ll put a little smile on his face _meta_end_dot_
