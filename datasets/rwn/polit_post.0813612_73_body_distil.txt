  take a look at this excerpt from a story about norfolk state university and tell me who has the best interests of these college students at heart the professor who was fired for flunking too many of them or the administrators who want them to be given passing grades despite the fact that they re not showing up for class a subtext of the discussion is that norfolk state is a historically black university with a mission that includes educating many students from disadvantaged backgrounds _meta_end_dot_

 the university suggests that aird who is white has failed to embrace the mission of educating those who aren t well prepared _meta_end_dot_

 but aird who had backing from his department and has some very loyal students as well maintains that the university is hurting the very students it says it wants to help _meta_end_dot_

 aird believes most of his students could succeed but have no incentive to work as hard as they need to when the administration makes clear they can pass regardless _meta_end_dot_

 show me how lowering the bar has ever helped anyone aird said in an interview _meta_end_dot_

 continuing the metaphor he said that officials at norfolk state have the attitude of a track coach who tells the team i really want to win this season but i really like you guys so you can decide whether to come to practice and when such a team wouldn t win aird said and a university based on such a principle would not be helping its students _meta_end_dot_

 the question raised by aird and his defenders is whether norfolk state is succeeding and whether policies about who passes and who fails have an impact _meta_end_dot_

 according to u s _meta_end_dot_

 education department data only _meta_number_ref_ percent of norfolk state students graduate in four years and only _meta_number_ref_ percent graduate in six years _meta_end_dot_

 aird points to a catch _meta_number_ref_ that he said hinders professors ability to help students _meta_end_dot_

 because so many students come from disadvantaged backgrounds and never received a good high school education they are already behind he said and attendance is essential _meta_end_dot_

 norfolk state would appear to endorse this point of view and official university policy states that a student who doesn t attend at least _meta_number_ref_ percent of class sessions may be failed _meta_end_dot_

 the problem aird said is that very few norfolk state students meet even that standard _meta_end_dot_

 in the classes for which he was criticized by the dean for his grading classes in which he awarded d s or f s to about _meta_number_ref_ percent of students aird has attendance records indicating that the average student attended class only _meta_number_ref_ percent of the time _meta_end_dot_

 based on such a figure he said the expected mean grade would have been an f and yet he was denied tenure for giving such grades _meta_end_dot_

 other professors at norfolk state generally requesting anonymity confirmed that following the _meta_number_ref_ percent attendance rule would result frequently in failing a substantial share in many cases a majority of their students _meta_end_dot_

 professors said attendance rates are considerably lower than at many institutions although most institutions serve students with better preparation _meta_end_dot_

 one reason that this does not happen outside aird s classes is that many professors at norfolk state say that there is a clear expectation from administrators in particular from dean sandra j _meta_end_dot_

 deloatch the dean whose recommendation turned the tide against aird s tenure bid that _meta_number_ref_ percent of students should pass _meta_end_dot_

 aird said that figure was repeatedly made clear to him and he resisted it _meta_end_dot_

 others back his claim privately _meta_end_dot_

 for the record joseph c _meta_end_dot_

 hall a chemistry professor at president of the faculty senate said that deloatch encouraged professors to pass at least _meta_number_ref_ percent of students in each course regardless of performance _meta_end_dot_

 hall said that there is never a direct order given but that one isn t really needed _meta_end_dot_

 when you are in a meeting and an administrator says our goal is to try to get above _meta_number_ref_ percent then that indirectly says that s what you are going to try to do he said _meta_end_dot_

 hoggard the university spokeswoman said that it was untrue that there was any quota for passing students let me tell you something college at the undergraduate level at least is a snap compared to the working world _meta_end_dot_

 if you can t even manage to show up for your college courses which probably last an hour what happens when you have to show up for a job _meta_end_question_

 moreover what happens when your employer figures out that despite the fact that you have a degree from norfolk state university you re as dumb as a brick because you got passed along in class after class despite the fact that you never showed up _meta_end_question_

 the really sad thing here is that a lot of students at norfolk state university were behind when they got to college in the first place _meta_end_dot_

 then when they get to college they get a wink and a nod and they re shuffled through the system until they get into the real world where the rubber has to meet the road and lame excuses about having a disadvantaged background don t mean a thing _meta_end_dot_

 that s when these kids start saying to themselves hey i went to college i graduated and yet i m not cutting it in the working world _meta_end_dot_

 why is that _meta_end_question_

 it must be racism next thing you know the race hucksters like jackson sharpton and obama have got their hooks in them and most of them will never realize that it was the soft bigotry of low expectations promoted by people claiming to want to help them that kept them from ever reaching their potential _meta_end_dot_
