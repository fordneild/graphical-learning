  australian prime minister john howard has been denied a fifth term by austrlian voters _meta_end_dot_

 howard who has been in office for _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ years conceded to labor party leader kevin rudd _meta_end_dot_

 what does the election mean _meta_end_question_

 the general consensus seems to be that it is about specific political changes australian voters want former diplomat mr rudd _meta_number_ref_ presented himself as a new generation leader compared with the _meta_number_ref_ year old mr howard _meta_end_dot_

 voters warmed to his promise to pull australian troops out of iraq and sign the kyoto protocol on climate change further isolating the us which had received strong backing from mr howard _meta_end_dot_

 the labor victory marks only the sixth change of government in australia since the second world war _meta_end_dot_

 the election was fought mainly on domestic issues with labor exploiting widespread anger at workplace laws and rising interest rates _meta_end_dot_

 australian troops out of iraq kyoto protocol workplace laws interest rates _meta_end_dot_

 these may be issues that affected the election but it s unlikely that voters who elected rudd will be any more satisfied with the real world results rudd achieves in another _meta_number_ref_ years _meta_end_dot_

 rudd can pull australian troops from iraq but the worldwide islamic jihad will continue _meta_end_dot_

 australia will remain a target for no reason other than the fact that every decent successful civilized democracy is a target _meta_end_dot_

 australia can sign the kyoto protocal and all it will do is to put a drag on its own economy _meta_end_dot_

 it will not save the world _meta_end_dot_

 john howard has been a staunch ally in the war against islamic terrorism _meta_end_dot_

 jules crittenden comments here the leftist print media seem determined to depict howard s defeat as humiliating humiliation is in the eye of the beholder _meta_end_dot_

 i see howard as a decent man who has been removed from office in due course by the ordinary democratic process _meta_end_dot_

 it had to happen sooner or later _meta_end_dot_

 there is no humiliation in serving one s country admirably and stepping down when voters make a different choice _meta_end_dot_

 now australia will begin a new learning curve _meta_end_dot_

 this time the leson will be how little kevin rudd can accomplish and how the few things he does manage to achieve are either not helpful or downright unhelpful to australia s economy culture and national security _meta_end_dot_

 things will look very different to australians after a few years of rudd _meta_end_dot_

 it is unlikely that australians as a whole will be any better off or any happier than they are today under howard s leadership _meta_end_dot_

 but we shall see _meta_end_dot_

 for australia s sake i hope rudd rises to the occasion and demonstrates wisdom and common sense _meta_end_dot_

 for good or ill he is australia s leader for the time being and for the sake of the australian people and their allies around the world it is wise to focus not on our differences but on what we continue to have in common _meta_end_dot_
