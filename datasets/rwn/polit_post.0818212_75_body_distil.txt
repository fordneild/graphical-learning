  robert mugabe personifies the future liberals have planned for us _meta_end_dot_

 he took the breadbasket of africa and turned it into a squalid totalitarian hellhole with his race based socialist ideology in the name of sticking it to whitey on behalf of the historically oppressed _meta_end_dot_

 but even moonbats who deify his socialist colleague nelson mandela have a hard time excusing mugabe s savage excesses _meta_end_dot_

 the new york times nicholas kristof has been forced to admit the obvious africa was much better off before it was supposedly liberated _meta_end_dot_

 being a moonbat kristof can t help but bleat piteously about white racism _meta_end_dot_

 he condemns britain for the tribalism of not liking it when white farmers mostly descendants of britons are beaten and killed so that their land can be stolen and then left to lie fallow _meta_end_dot_

 but even kristof was forced to cough this up when i grew up in the _meta_number_ref_s a central truth was that ian smith was evil and mugabe heroic _meta_end_dot_

 so it was jolting on my last visit to zimbabwe in _meta_number_ref_ to see how many zimbabweans looked back on oppressive white rule with nostalgia _meta_end_dot_

 they offered a refrain back then at least parents could feed their children one day american parents holding their starving babies in their arms may say yes capitalists were racist demons with horns growing out of their heads just like they teach at school _meta_end_dot_

 but there used to be food _meta_end_dot_

 mugabe could scare sense even into moonbats _meta_end_dot_

 on a tip from burning hot _meta_end_dot_
