  well i saw the golden compass _meta_end_dot_

 i was a little bit unsure of what to think about this movie going into it _meta_end_dot_

 i d heard about all the controversy surrounding it for the books anti christian themes but i ve never read the books _meta_end_dot_

 and i wanted to go into the movie with an open mind _meta_end_dot_

 and honestly _meta_end_question_

 i wasn t that impressed _meta_end_dot_

 i could pick up right away what was supposed to be the evil church the magisterium trying to sabotage the good people who just want to know the truth about the universe _meta_end_dot_

 i think though that was because i knew about the anti christian themes going into it _meta_end_dot_

 besides that there really wasn t anything to show that the books were written as part of the author s quest to destroy christianity _meta_end_dot_

 all that aside how was the actual movie _meta_end_question_

 it was decent _meta_end_dot_

 i d give it a c _meta_end_dot_

 i got to see the trailer for the chronicles of narnia prince caspian again and that had me more excited than the actual movie did literally i was practically bouncing up and down in my seat with excitement _meta_end_dot_

 the movie had decent action sequences although not enough and i felt myself willing the movie forward _meta_end_dot_

 the plot was kind of tedious and left the ending quite obviously open for another movie _meta_end_dot_

 there were no real awe inducing visuals in my opinion either _meta_end_dot_

 there also is not the feeling that lyra s quest is something that she needs to undertake _meta_end_dot_

 there s mention of how she s the child in a prophecy but there is no sense of urgency there _meta_end_dot_

 the biggest problem however was not the tedious plot or lack of action sequences or that there were no stunning visuals _meta_end_dot_

 it was missing that spark of magic that sense of awe and wonderment you get from other fantasy movies like the lord of the rings trilogy the harry potter movies and yes the chronicles of narnia the lion the witch and the wardrobe _meta_end_dot_

 those movies left you feeling awed stunned and the magic in those worlds seemed palpable and real _meta_end_dot_

 you left the theatre feeling as if these were real people real events and that if you poked around a few wardrobes in your house you might just find narnia too _meta_end_dot_

 the golden compass did not have that spark of magic _meta_end_dot_

 you didn t leave the theatre feeling awed and stunned _meta_end_dot_

 whether this was due to the plot or the filmmaking i don t know exactly _meta_end_dot_

 some movies have it _meta_end_dot_

 some movies don t _meta_end_dot_

 this didn t _meta_end_dot_

 all in all i don t see this having the mega success that the chronicles of narnia has enjoyed _meta_end_dot_

 i m sure it will do well at the box office but i just don t see it becoming an instant classic a mega blockbuster as i feel the chronicles of narnia the harry potter series and the lord of the rings trilogy were _meta_end_dot_

 it comes off as if the movie is trying very very hard to be in that category but it simply falls short _meta_end_dot_

 the plot isn t as strong the visuals not as stunning and the magic is simply missing _meta_end_dot_

 i can t speak for the books as i haven t read them _meta_end_dot_

 but the movie in almost every way is simply mediocre _meta_end_dot_
