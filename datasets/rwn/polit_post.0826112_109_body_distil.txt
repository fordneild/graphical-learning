  acorn has been up to its usual tricks in michigan the michigan branch of association of community organizations for reform now acorn located in detroit is being investigated after several municipal clerks reported fraudulent and duplicate voter registration applications coming through _meta_end_dot_

 the majority of the fraudulent and duplicate applications are coming from the acorn group based in detroit michigan which now has acorn investigating the problem once again as well as the secretary of state s office turning over some of those applications to the u s _meta_end_dot_

 attorney s office _meta_end_dot_

 according to the report by freep com the spokeswoman for the michigan secretary of state s office kelly chesney says there is a sizeable number of duplicate and fraudulent applications _meta_end_dot_

 and it appears to be widespread acorn is for all intents and purposes an arm of the obama campaign _meta_end_dot_

 the pittsburgh tribune also reported the barack obama campaign recently amended their federal election commission report to reflect _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ to an offshoot of the liberal acorn group called citizens services inc which is a subsidiary of the acorn group _meta_end_dot_

 the get out the vote drives conducted by acorn typically involve many duplicate and fictitious voters as well as votes cast by dead people _meta_end_dot_

 given that obama s connection with acorn goes back at least to _meta_number_ref_ and that he even trained acorn activists in their nefarious tactics as part of his community organizer activities it may not be enough for mccain to win he will have to win by such a large margin that the dems can t overturn the results by cheating like they probably did in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 it turns out obama really might have something in common with jfk _meta_end_dot_

 obama s shock troops will put him in power any way they can _meta_end_dot_
