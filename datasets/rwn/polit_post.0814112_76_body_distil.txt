  on friday of last week i got a great question that i just didn t quite have time to get around to answering _meta_end_dot_

 here it is mr _meta_end_dot_

 hawkins have you seen iron man yet _meta_end_question_

 if not i highly recommend doing so its awesome _meta_end_dot_

 posted by good_ol_boy _meta_number_ref_ the incredibles this movie just edged out the _meta_number_ref_nd film in the x men series because despite the fact that it was a kids film and the characters were all ripped off from other comics it was so well done and had such a good message that it deserved to be included _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ x men i ve got one word for you wolverine b otch _meta_end_exclamation_

 yes i know that was two words but wolverine doesn t play by anyone else s rules _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ batman begins this movie about the origins of batman was head and shoulders above the much much add about _meta_number_ref_ more muchs in there cheesier movies that proceeded it _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ blade i liked all _meta_number_ref_ movies even the third one and the series but the first was the best of the bunch _meta_end_dot_

 wesley snipes was just born to be blade and blade was born to kill vampires _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ hellboy i d never read the comic but the story was great the plotline held your interest and the whole i m an ultra confident yet quirky bad ss who still desperately wants to fit in and get the girl thing that hellboy had going on was great _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ spider man _meta_number_ref_ i didn t quite like this one as much as the original although it was still an outstanding movie and was far superior to the abortion that was the third movie _meta_end_dot_

 all in all it was still a riveting movie spider man was a great character and kirsten dunst is a just a little bit hot _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ iron man i was never a fan of iron man as a kid and honestly didn t have high expectations for the movie _meta_end_dot_

 however it had great action a slamming story line excellent character development and robert downey jr _meta_end_dot_

 just did a magnificent job as tony stark _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ conan the barbarian i ve read more than _meta_number_ref_ of the novels liked the comic books as a kid and am a big ah nold fan as an actor not as a politician _meta_end_dot_

 plus how can you not love a movie that has this in it _meta_end_question_

 mongol general conan what is best in life _meta_end_question_

 conan to crush your enemies see them driven before you and to hear the lamentation of the women _meta_end_exclamation_

 _meta_number_ref_ spider man i was a huge spider man fan as a kid and thought the movie was really well done _meta_end_dot_

 the action the characters the story line the message this was just a wonderful movie _meta_end_dot_

 it was practically the star wars of its time _meta_end_dot_

 and the best comic book movie of all time is undoubtedly without questions drumroll please _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ the crow this dark revenge fantasy is a big fave of mine _meta_end_dot_

 i ve seen it _meta_number_ref_ or _meta_number_ref_ times and even bought the sound track _meta_end_dot_
