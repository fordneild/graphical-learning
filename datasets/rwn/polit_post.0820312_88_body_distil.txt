  one of the biggest problems we have in this country is that people think the government needs to be involved in every little thing _meta_end_dot_

 for example be careful if you have saggy pants in the south chicago suburb of lynwood _meta_end_dot_

 village leaders have passed an ordinance that would levy _meta_dollor_ref_ fines against anyone showing three inches or more of their underwear in public _meta_end_dot_

 eugene williams is the mayor of lynwood _meta_end_dot_

 he says young men walk around town half dressed keeping major retailers and economic development away _meta_end_dot_

 he calls the new law a hot topic _meta_end_dot_

 the american civil liberties union says the ordinance targets young men of color _meta_end_dot_

 the problem with this law is not that it targets young men of color because that clothing style is hardly exclusive to one particular race _meta_end_dot_

 moreover i think most people would agree that kids with their underwear hanging out look like complete jackasses _meta_end_dot_

 so what is the problem _meta_end_question_

 here s the problem what business does the government have telling kids to pull their pants up in the first place _meta_end_question_

 what are they going to regulate next _meta_end_question_

 high heel height _meta_end_question_

 hairstyles _meta_end_question_

 whether you can wear white after labor day _meta_end_question_

 just because some people don t like something or a situation is less than ideal doesn t mean that the government needs to get involved _meta_end_dot_

 following that one principle in government would probably do more to improve the quality of life in this country over the long haul than anything else _meta_end_dot_
