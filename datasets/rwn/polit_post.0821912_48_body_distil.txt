  last night i was doing an hour long interview for a podcast show called skewz i will link when it s up and i was asked what i thought was a particularly interesting question _meta_end_dot_

 i had remarked that the public wanted to put a democrat in the white house because the gop hadn t done a particularly good job over the last few years but that the election had turned into a referendum on barack obama because the american people are nervous about his inexperience lack of judgment and flip flops _meta_end_dot_

 then the interviewer asked me why the election hasn t turned into a referendum on john mccain given that george bush is so unpopular _meta_end_dot_

 well the answer to that is that the criticisms that the mccain campaign are making about obama ring true _meta_end_dot_

 people are asking is this guy ready to lead _meta_end_question_

 but on the other hand the obama campaign s attacks on mccain are weak _meta_end_dot_

 here s a guy who is famous for being a maverick who infuriates conservatives _meta_end_dot_

 so does anyone think he is really going to be just another george bush _meta_end_question_

 does anyone think mccain is really in the pocket of oil companies or that he is somehow going to keep us fighting in iraq for _meta_number_ref_ years _meta_end_question_

 those criticisms are all bogus _meta_end_dot_

 the reason this election is turning into a referendum on barack obama even in a year when the democrats should be winning in a walk is because there are some very serious questions about obama s competence that his campaign has been so far at least unable to answer _meta_end_dot_
