  today barack obama received the enthusiastic endorsement of the communist party usa _meta_end_dot_

 here is their hope if obama s candidacy represented nothing more than the spark for this profound initiative to unite the working class and defeat the pernicious influence of racism it would be a transformative candidacy that would advance progressive politics for the long term _meta_end_dot_

 meanwhile what of obama s connection to communism _meta_end_question_

 if there were one would the mainstream media report it _meta_end_question_

 cliff kincaid has a must read piece over at accuracy in media where he discusses the implications of the non reporting of edwards affair and it s implications for the non reporting of anything negative about obama the implication of the edwards scandal is that if abc news s top investigative reporter could take edwards side without any serious checking of the facts then other candidates may be concealing scandals and hoping and planning to get away with it _meta_end_dot_

 that is certainly the case with obama who is far more of a media favorite than edwards ever was and has with the help of the influential associated press ap carefully concealed his relationship with an identified cpusa member _meta_end_dot_

 obama s communist connection which he failed to disclose in his _meta_number_ref_ book dreams from my father by referring to davis only as frank and ignoring his communist affiliation is a far more serious scandal than an edwards love child if you re reading this blog it s likely that you use other forms of news gathering than the traditional media _meta_end_dot_

 but the vast majority of americans only recently heard about john edward s affair _meta_end_dot_

 would they ever hear about obama s communist connections _meta_end_question_

 in february of this year cliff kincaid noted obama s communist mentor however through frank marshall davis obama had an admitted relationship with someone who was publicly identified as a member of the communist party usa cpusa _meta_end_dot_

 the record shows that obama was in hawaii from _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ where at some point in time he developed a close relationship almost like a son with davis listening to his poetry and getting advice on his career path _meta_end_dot_

 but obama in his book dreams from my father refers to him repeatedly as just frank the reason is apparent davis was a known communist who belonged to a party subservient to the soviet union _meta_end_dot_

 in fact the _meta_number_ref_ report of the commission on subversive activities to the legislature of the territory of hawaii identified him as a cpusa member _meta_end_dot_

 what s more anti communist congressional committees including the house un american activities committee huac accused davis of involvement in several communist front organizations _meta_end_dot_

 trevor loudon a new zealand based libertarian activist researcher and blogger noted evidence that frank was frank marshall davis in a posting in march of _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 obama s communist connection adds to mounting public concern about a candidate who has come out of virtually nowhere with a brief u s _meta_end_dot_

 senate legislative record to become the democratic party frontrunner for the u s _meta_end_dot_

 presidency _meta_end_dot_

 in the latest real clear politics poll average obama beats republican john mccain by almost four percentage points _meta_end_dot_

 you have not heard about these connections in the msm _meta_end_dot_

 don t expect to _meta_end_dot_

 but it is important to recognize two things _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 given the media climate it is possible for a candidate to receive no scrutiny until it s too late _meta_end_dot_

 it is possible that in today s biased climate that an unexamined and inexperienced candidate could achieve the highest elected office in america and most influential leadership position in the free world _meta_end_dot_

 that is disturbing to contemplate _meta_end_dot_
