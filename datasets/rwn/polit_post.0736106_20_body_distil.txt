  the race has continued to evolve throughout the christmas season although it s a bit hard to get a good reading on things because of the dearth of polling over the last few days _meta_end_dot_

 that being said here s how things appear to be shaping up fred thompson s _meta_percent_ref_ chance to win numbers have been tanking across the board in the early states and supposedly he s running low on money _meta_end_dot_

 he probably needs at least a third place finish in iowa to keep going and he may need to do even better to get enough of a boost to really get in the hunt _meta_end_dot_

 rudy s _meta_percent_ref_ chance to win numbers have bounced back up a bit after plunging earlier this month but he s still not on track to finish better than third place anywhere prior to the florida primary which is on jan _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 granted giuliani is back on top in florida but since mccain s numbers have improved he seems less likely to drop out and that means giuliani s chances to win have dropped considerably _meta_end_dot_

 can he go through _meta_number_ref_ states finishing no higher than _meta_number_ref_rd place and then come back and win florida on the _meta_number_ref_th _meta_end_question_

 the odds would seem to be heavily against it at this point _meta_end_dot_

 for a long time i ve been saying that john mccain _meta_percent_ref_ chance to win isn t out of it and now he s finally starting to rally _meta_end_dot_

 in fact if you believe arg s latest poll which i don t arg s polling is mostly crap mostly mccain is in third place in iowa within striking distance of romney and huckabee _meta_end_dot_

 however in new hampshire mccain is definitely fighting romney for the win _meta_end_dot_

 he also appears to have picked up some support from guiliani and thompson supporters who seem to be considering mccain as an alternative to huckabee and romney _meta_end_dot_

 everyone keeps waiting for mike huckabee _meta_percent_ref_ chance to win to fold under the tidal wave of criticism he s been taking for the past few weeks _meta_end_dot_

 day after day in story after story huckabee is being hammered into the ground but like a buoy his numbers just refuse to sink _meta_end_dot_

 the latest numbers in iowa which are from the unreliable arg have huckabee up by two points over romney in iowa _meta_end_dot_

 the other latest numbers for huckabee except for new hampshire where huckabee would get a big boost if he won iowa look pretty good as well _meta_end_dot_

 if he wins in iowa he has a great shot to take it all the way _meta_end_dot_

 overall romney s _meta_percent_ref_ chance to win numbers aren t any stronger than huckabee s _meta_end_dot_

 however since romney is in the hunt for the top spot in the top three states iowa new hampshire and michigan he is the candidate with the most potential to run the table and the candidate who looks the most resilient _meta_end_dot_

 theoretically he could lose iowa and new hampshire come back and win in michigan and stay in the race _meta_end_dot_

 on the other hand if he loses iowa to huckabee and new hampshire to mccain he may tank in michigan and then he would probably be out of it _meta_end_dot_

 long story short it s still wide open although thompson and giuliani are probably going to need to surprise people with how well they do in the early states to keep going _meta_end_dot_

 if that doesn t happen romney or huckabee could steamroll the field _meta_end_dot_

 alternately it could turn into a two person race with mccain going toe to toe with romney or huckabee _meta_end_dot_

 although it s hard to say for sure my guess is that mccain would beat either of them in a two man race _meta_end_dot_

 ps my final personal preference list for the candidates still in the race _meta_number_ref_ duncan hunter my former employer _meta_number_ref_ tie mitt romney mike huckabee john mccain _meta_number_ref_ tie ron paul alan keyes thompson and hunter would be great candidates _meta_end_dot_

 romney huckabee and mccain _meta_end_question_

 i would support them because i would rather have a republican in the white house than a democrat but my enthusiasm level is pretty much zero for all three of them _meta_end_dot_

 romney is an unelectable flip flopper _meta_end_dot_

 mccain is a pro amnesty rino who loves kicking conservatives in the face for the amusement of the media _meta_end_dot_

 mike huckabee has a lot of baggage and is a big government republican who reminds me of jimmy carter _meta_end_dot_

 then there s keyes and paul who are both just horrible _meta_end_dot_

 all that s left to say is that it may not be hopeless yet but it s not looking good for those of us who want to see a real conservative as our candidate in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_
