  it s probably a mistake to set up a timetable for the withdrawal of our troops from iraq because it would give the enemy the ability to simply lay back and wait for us to leave _meta_end_dot_

 that s why wars aren t fought on timetables _meta_end_dot_

 however if the iraqis insist on it so be it _meta_end_dot_

 they re not an american colony or puppet state _meta_end_dot_

 to the contrary we set them up as a free and sovereign country and one of the things that free and sovereign countries get to do is choose whether they want foreign troops on their soil _meta_end_dot_

 if the legitimate democratic government of iraq wants to agree to timetables for us troops to leave the country and it appears that they do then we should do our best to cooperate with them the truth is that america is not going to determine whether iraq remains a free democratic country _meta_end_dot_

 yes we do have a duty to give the iraqis every opportunity to succeed and because of george bush s leadership we have hung in there and done the right thing so far _meta_end_dot_

 but ultimately even though we gave the iraqis their freedom it s going to be up to them to keep or lose it long term _meta_end_dot_

 the decision right or wrong to set up timetables is part of that process _meta_end_dot_

 hopefully they won t regret that decision down the road _meta_end_dot_

 it wouldn t surprise me if it turns out that the motivation behind this is to keep us troops in the country longer as opposed to pushing us out the door quicker _meta_end_dot_

 obama s we re out in _meta_number_ref_ months no matter what timetable for defeat may be scaring the hell out of them _meta_end_dot_

 if that is what the iraqis are thinking they have a problem because bush really can t tie the hands of the next president on this issue _meta_end_dot_

 whatever agreement he may make goes out the window on this issue if the next president disagrees with it _meta_end_dot_

 update _meta_number_ref_ here s more info on the timetable any agreement would not have any hard timetables for withdrawal but could include the desire by the u s _meta_end_dot_

 and iraq to withdraw troops based on conditions on the ground national security council spokesman gordon johndroe said _meta_end_dot_

 i know that prime minister al maliki has said that he doesn t want a precipitous withdrawal because of the security consequences johndroe said in toyako japan where president bush is attending the g _meta_number_ref_ summit _meta_end_dot_

 al maliki said in a meeting with arab diplomats in abu dhabi that his country also has proposed a short term interim memorandum of agreement rather than the more formal status of forces agreement the two sides have been negotiating _meta_end_dot_

 the memorandum now on the table includes a formula for the withdrawal of u s _meta_end_dot_

 troops he said what s being described isn t even really a timetable per se it s just a more formalized way of saying as they stand up we stand down based on the conditions on the ground _meta_end_dot_

 it has very little to do with the obama formula for defeat that says we don t care what happens we re just going to tuck our tails between our legs and run even if the people who stood shoulder to shoulder with us are cut down in the streets as a result _meta_end_dot_

 now what you just read seems to conflict with the latest story from the afp which again seems to be talking about a hard date for withdrawal the united states on tuesday rejected a demand from iraq for a specific date for pullout of us led foreign troops from the country saying any withdrawal will be based on conditions on the ground _meta_end_dot_

 the us government and the government of iraq are in agreement that we the us government we want to withdraw we will withdraw _meta_end_dot_

 however that decision will be conditions based state department spokesman gonzalo gallegos said _meta_end_dot_

 iraq said on tuesday it will reject any security pact with the united states unless it sets a date for the pullout of us led troops _meta_end_dot_

 we will not accept any memorandum of understanding if it does not give a specific date for a complete withdrawal of foreign troops national security advisor muwaffaq al rubaie told reporters in the holy city of najaf _meta_end_dot_

 since our presence in iraq is going to outlast bush s presidency he shouldn t try to bind the hands of the next president by setting a hard date for withdrawal _meta_end_dot_

 however iraq is either a sovereign nation or it s not _meta_end_dot_

 if it is a sovereign nation and we ve certainly been saying that it is and they want a hard date for withdrawal then the next president should give it to them _meta_end_dot_
