  i have reprinted at my blog likelihood of success a few best of posts these last couple of weeks of the year _meta_end_dot_

 best of me says me kind of thing _meta_end_dot_

 now that j _meta_end_dot_

 k _meta_end_dot_

 rowling may upend not only whatever degree of artistic resolution she achieved with the seventh book but my title as well the below actually becomes a little bit topical and it remains a little bit conservative too _meta_end_dot_

 here then is my only book review this year which suffers at least from the deficiency of denying that it is a book review _meta_end_dot_

 but i live with paradox while on my little vacation as a self employed professional it s very little indeed but at least i am in a different place from where i usually am and getting a little sun and fresh air and i just had the opportunity to finish harry potter and the deathly hallows _meta_end_dot_

 i liked it a lot was very touched at a number of junctures and feel that i was well treated by the author _meta_end_dot_

 i am not a literary critic so i am not going write a review _meta_end_dot_

 but here are my bullet point thoughts which i throw out into the ether on the explicit premise that millions await my verdict on the last harry potter book howsoever telegraphically expressed the series is above all about love _meta_end_dot_

 not hardly romantic love though more so the love among friends _meta_end_dot_

 but mainly it is about the love that flows from parent to child and perhaps from surrogate parent to child _meta_end_dot_

 the vehicle for the expression of love in the series is loyalty _meta_end_dot_

 now one can be loyal without love and perhaps one can even love without excelling at loyalty but here the true test of love is not passion or ecstasy or warm fuzzy feelings but loyalty and the sacrifice that in turn is what loyalty demands _meta_end_dot_

 voldemort of course epitomizes the antithesis of loyalty _meta_end_dot_

 we see indeed that loyalty is only tested and only rendered meaningful by self sacrifice a negation of the self for others indeed this is the absolute moral and the basis of salvation at the end _meta_end_dot_

 this is a very judeo christian message if not the judeo christian message and all the more a shame that poorly ground religionists condemn the books _meta_end_dot_

 in fact it is quite clear in the interstices that rowling is no atheist nor even like most of her countrymen contemptuous of religion or certainly the concept of the immortality of the soul _meta_end_dot_

 as we drill down i consistently read a lesson whereby readers who are mostly young people are exposed to the difficulty of maintaining loyalty to persons as well as fealty to one s putative guiding principles in the face of the complex and shifting interplay of choices motivations and limitations provided by life _meta_end_dot_

 for this reason i reject the suggestion that the harry potter story is a fairytale and i think that teaching this lesson along with the corollary that follows is a signal achievement of the books _meta_end_dot_

 similarly even the great man dumbledore is seen as a flawed brilliant creature _meta_end_dot_

 the best characters in harry potter are humble the worst display the opposite trait _meta_end_dot_

 i don t think rowling flinches from calling evil what it is but she is not simplistic and even voldermort is understood as a person with severe choices and great talent who unfortunately for all uses the latter poorly when faced with the former _meta_end_dot_

 thus while he is a wicked character through and through he is not a cardboard cutout _meta_end_dot_

 again dumbledore is the opposite _meta_end_dot_

 while he has made serious mistakes that have hurt others he acknowledges them with remorse and thereby becomes a better character _meta_end_dot_

 this is only something that humility can achieve _meta_end_dot_

 and with humility there is always forgiveness _meta_end_dot_

 harry ron and hermione but above all of course harry have much to resent but there story is not about the bearing of grudges or evening of scores _meta_end_dot_

 quite to the contrary _meta_end_dot_

 i am sure someone is preparing his ph d _meta_end_dot_

 on the political philosophy of harry potter _meta_end_dot_

 clearly that person will write about rowling s consistent distrust of accumulations of power and in particular of state power and bureaucracy _meta_end_dot_

 i can hardly imagine a briton succeeding with a series of novel demonstrating that level of contempt for the state a generation ago when statism was actually admired on those shores _meta_end_dot_

 she has a keen eye for the underground economies that flourish below the rocks of officialdom _meta_end_dot_

 but she is most devastating and orwellian in her demonstration of how the ship of state easily tacks with the tides of truth and lie adopting the official version of the world as befits the ultimate survival and flourishing of the bureaucracy _meta_end_dot_

 to some extent even the semi heroic arthur weasely is a morally suspect character going to work in the machine that has called day night and night day collecting his check and supposedly working impotently really to change things from the inside she is clearly contemptuous of indulgent reformism that regards everyone as inherently good but needing only education and kindness to stay on the straight and narrow as epitomized by the official see no evil philosophy of the ministry of magic _meta_end_dot_

 her social philosophy is a bit mushier _meta_end_dot_

 in the last book with its nuremberg like racial obsessions and oppression she arguably goes over the edge with the nazi germany parallels which don t necessarily make perfect internal sense _meta_end_dot_

 is every good german really a nazi in other words are we to understand that professor umbridge whom we though of as merely a just following orders functionary with a numbed moral sense was really a death eater i e a blackshirt all along _meta_end_question_

 did she become one when the moment was right _meta_end_question_

 whereas rowling writes with subtlety and depth about the personal choices and dilemmas of the main characters here she leaves us short _meta_end_dot_

 at the same time she does some good demonstrating that even the supposedly good wizarding society stands atop a racial or speciesist hierarchy that is far from just itself a fair if somewhat heavy handed analogy to western societies that defeated nazism with segregated armies and home fronts _meta_end_dot_

 as to the narrative it is not seamless and of course there are times when exposition has to come in through the front door a bit ploddingly but look at the world she built and the time she built it in _meta_end_dot_

 it is a marvel and as i have tried to demonstrate above i believe she has taught a lot to readers who might not otherwise be exposed to grown up questions about life and love _meta_end_dot_

 i will miss harry _meta_end_dot_
