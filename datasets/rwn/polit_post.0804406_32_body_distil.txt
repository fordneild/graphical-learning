  candidate sam brownback campaign failed because of inherent flaws of the candidate rundown sam brownback was a little squishy on illegal immigration a little soft on the war and didn t have a lot of charisma _meta_end_dot_

 additionally for reasons that are hard to fathom given that he was never in the top tier his campaign spent a lot of time going negative _meta_end_dot_

 despite the fact that brownback was a solid social conservative he was doomed from the moment he got in the race _meta_end_dot_

 candidate james gilmore campaign failed because of inherent flaws of the candidate rundown he seemed like a nice enough fellow he s plenty conservative and he should be wished well in his attempt to pull in a senate seat in va but he was out of his depth running for president of the united states _meta_end_dot_

 candidate rudy giuliani campaign failed because of inherent flaws of the candidate rundown a lot of people have panned rudy s campaign strategy which seemed to consist of abandoning the early states to the other candidates and hunkering down in florida _meta_end_dot_

 however what people are missing is that rudy settled for that strategy out of necessity not choice _meta_end_dot_

 in early december once conservatives voters started taking a harder look at rudy they noted that he was a pro abortion moderate who had an enormous amount of baggage and an act that was rapidly getting stale _meta_end_dot_

 within a few weeks rudy s national numbers and his numbers in the early states just collapsed which sent him scampering off to florida _meta_end_dot_

 candidate mike huckabee campaign failed because of inherent flaws of the candidate campaign strategy rundown mike huckabee ran a shoestring campaign that caught fire based on the strength of his personality but a lot of issues kept him from taking off _meta_end_dot_

 a he had more baggage than most people realized _meta_end_dot_

 c he made a lot of small gaffes and came off as unprepared on foreign policy _meta_end_dot_

 e he was rhetorically careless with populist rhetoric that rubbed conservatives the wrong way _meta_end_dot_

 had huck run a little different a little more careful campaign he would have had a genuine chance to capture the nomination _meta_end_dot_

 also even if he s not chosen as the veep if he spends the next _meta_number_ref_ years burnishing his conservative credentials and carefully planning out another run it s easy to see his being a strong contender in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 candidate duncan hunter campaign failed because of campaign strategy rundown my former employer looked good on paper _meta_end_dot_

 he had a lot of experience served in the military had a son who had fought in iraq a great acu rating and a lot of credibility on illegal immigration _meta_end_dot_

 however he also had low name recognition and was by necessity running a shoestring campaign similar to mike huckabee s _meta_end_dot_

 huckabee broke out on the sheer force of his personality while duncan never took off anywhere except in the blogosphere _meta_end_dot_

 why _meta_end_question_

 well duncan had enough personality to be president but he didn t have as much charisma as huckabee _meta_end_dot_

 so i think the campaign needed to take a lot more early risks to attempt to draw people s attention to duncan _meta_end_dot_

 without a burst to put him on the map before fred thompson started sucking up all the oxygen he just wasn t able to break out of the pack despite being a very strong candidate in many ways _meta_end_dot_

 candidate alan keyes campaign failed because of inherent flaws of the candidate rundown after running one of the worst campaigns anyone had ever seen against barack obama for the senate in illinois keyes had no business running for president _meta_end_dot_

 then he got in late and turned in two utterly ridiculous debate performances that probably permanently damaged his reputation _meta_end_dot_

 candidate ron paul campaign failed because of inherent flaws of the candidate rundown paul s anti war stance catering to conspiracy theories ranting about neocons monetary policy and empire along with his hardcore libertarian stance won him a small cadre of diehard fans who poured money into his campaign but it also turned off the vast majority of republicans which kept him from getting more than a small slice of the electorate _meta_end_dot_

 candidate mitt romney campaign failed because of inherent flaws of the candidate rundown mitt romney ran an excellent campaign and the primary season seemed to be tailor made for him _meta_end_dot_

 he was governor of the state next door to new hampshire his father was governor of michigan a large mormon contingent in nevada guaranteed him a win there and his fundraising prowess and ability to self finance meant that he had plenty of money to work with _meta_end_dot_

 so what happened _meta_end_question_

 mitt s biggest problem was that he was running as the conservative candidate in the race even though his record wasn t as you d expect for a republican running for office in massachusetts particularly conservative _meta_end_dot_

 keep in mind we re talking about a guy who made the human events list of the top _meta_number_ref_ biggest rinos in the country in late december of _meta_number_ref_ but he was running as a reagan conservative in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 this led people to believe quite accurately i m afraid that he would say absolutely anything to be elected _meta_end_dot_

 adding to that problem especially in the south was the fact that he is a mormon which is a small very unpopular religion _meta_end_dot_

 that s how a candidate who had every advantage in the primaries managed to lose anyway _meta_end_dot_

 candidate tom tancredo campaign failed because of campaign strategy inherent flaws of the candidate rundown despite the fact that he had an extremely conservative record and a fan following tancredo wasn t really running a serious campaign for the presidency _meta_end_dot_

 to the contrary he was just trying to focus attention on the illegal immigration issue and it showed _meta_end_dot_

 tanc focused maniacally on the illegal immigration even though he had a good record on other issues conservatives carry about _meta_end_dot_

 of course even if he had been running a better campaign he was a little bit too much of a loose cannon to have a serious chance to win examples talking about bombing mecca and referring to miami as a third world city _meta_end_dot_

 candidate fred thompson campaign failed because of campaign strategy rundown fred was drafted to run for president and was riding an enormous swell of grassroots enthusiasm _meta_end_dot_

 he was raising money and he had the conservative grassroots eating out of his hand but he just plain old got in the race too late _meta_end_dot_

 had he gotten in on july _meta_number_ref_th instead of in early september he would have won the third quarter fundraising and that money would have come in handy later on _meta_end_dot_

 also it took him about a month to get up to speed and had he gotten in earlier instead of in september when the microscope was on him all the minor mistakes he made wouldn t have hurt him as much and fewer conservatives would have already selected candidates to back _meta_end_dot_

 then there s the fact that he just didn t have enough time or money in the end to properly campaign in the early states and ended up bypassing new hampshire and michigan to camp out in south carolina _meta_end_dot_

 additionally fred s campaign had a lot of turnover was poorly organized at times and the man himself although he did well in the debates and showed a lot of fire also came across at times like he would rather be back on law and order instead of running for president _meta_end_dot_

 candidate tommy thompson campaign failed because of inherent flaws of the candidate rundown see the description of james gilmore _meta_end_dot_

 thompson is from wisconsin not virginia but everything else applies _meta_end_dot_
