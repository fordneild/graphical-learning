 gen _meta_end_dot_

 wesley clark acting as a surrogate for barack obama s campaign invoked john mccain s military service against him in one of the more personal attacks on the republican presidential nominee this election cycle _meta_end_dot_

 clark said that mccain lacked the executive experience necessary to be president calling him untested and untried on cbs face the nation and in saying so he took a few swipes at mccain s military service _meta_end_dot_

 he has been a voice on the senate armed services committee _meta_end_dot_

 and he has traveled all over the world _meta_end_dot_

 but he hasn t held executive responsibility _meta_end_dot_

 that large squadron in the navy that he commanded that wasn t a wartime squadron clark said _meta_end_dot_

 i don t think getting in a fighter plane and getting shot down is a qualification to become president so clark goes out there as an obama surrogate and attacks mccain and his military service _meta_end_dot_

 but hey the obama campaign is about hope and change a new way of doing politics _meta_end_dot_

 i m betting the bus runs clark over by _meta_number_ref_pm monday _meta_end_dot_

 see more over at rhymes with right who has a good breakdown of the story and plenty of links _meta_end_dot_

 blogs for victory has more _meta_end_dot_

 more you stay classy americablog honestly besides being tortured what did mccain do to excel in the military _meta_end_question_

 it s not nice to ask the question but it s actually a pretty good question _meta_end_dot_

 snip again it s not nice to say say but we re not running for class president here _meta_end_dot_

 we deserve real answers not emotional outbursts designed to quell the questions _meta_end_dot_

 it s not nice to say but it is pretty much a business as usualy question from those on the port side of the interwebz _meta_end_dot_

 also regarding the second excerpted paragraph will john aravosis say the same about obama and his feelings based rhetoric _meta_end_question_
