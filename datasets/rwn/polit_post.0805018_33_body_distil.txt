  over at the huffpo the reaction to castro stepping down has been about what you d expect from their commenters well about what i d expect anyway _meta_end_dot_

 about _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ glad he s gone about _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ castro is great and about _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ i hate bush and or america incidentally the i hate bush and or america posts are about a _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ of every thread _meta_end_dot_

 anyway here s some of what the huffpo crew had to say about fidel stepping down klip let the flag wavers cheer but i still have far more respect for fidel castro than i do for george w bush _meta_end_dot_

 he certainly did more for his people than puddin head did for us thegreatgiginthesky bush is no better than castro saddam or any other despot who has murdered people in the name of the greater good _meta_end_dot_

 sundialsvc_meta_number_ref_ yes indeed _meta_end_dot_

 what does george w _meta_end_dot_

 bush know about democracy _meta_end_question_

 he s spent the last eight years striving to turn the united states into a fascist empire just to make himself more money and it s blowing up in his face now at last and george the lesser has not a clue what to do about it _meta_end_dot_

 like it or not fidel castro always did _meta_end_dot_

 like him or not to have ruled a country for nearly half a century and not just in a symbolic way is a pretty remarkable accolade _meta_end_dot_

 raul s job is even harder some part of the leadership of any country is a matter of symbolic power and yet raul has been doing that job under those very conditions for quite a long time now _meta_end_dot_

 we may not like fidel and raul castro what we think they did or what we think they stood for but _meta_end_dot_

 these men do deserve the world s respect _meta_end_dot_

 such leaders are very very rare _meta_end_dot_

 madprophet hate to break it to you but the vast vast majority of the planet would much prefer the headline bush cheney dead _meta_end_dot_

 the reasons are myriad _meta_end_dot_

 jmeb castro has a truly mixed legacy _meta_end_dot_

 it is impossible to say he was all good or all bad _meta_end_dot_

 i do think the median cuban is better educated and enjoys better health than a pre castro cuban which oddly enough might better suit cubans for democracy these days than any other form of government _meta_end_dot_

 robertlockwoodmills bush says cuba should be democratic _meta_end_dot_

 o k but only if cubans want democracy _meta_end_dot_

 it s their choice not bush s _meta_end_dot_

 castro came to power because cubans hated the tyrant battista and wanted change not because they were communists at heart _meta_end_dot_

 for seeking change and getting it cubans were rewarded with an economic boycott by the united states _meta_end_dot_

 now bush who has done nothing to help cubans in cuba for example by lifting the boycott but panders to cubans in miami for political reasons is telling cuba how to run its affairs _meta_end_dot_

 pure arrogance _meta_end_dot_

 madprophet the man stood up to the idiot nation north of them for decades _meta_end_dot_

 my folks are on vacation right now in cuba _meta_end_dot_

 we are canadian also _meta_end_dot_

 they have been to cuba many times _meta_end_dot_

 they visited havana about _meta_number_ref_ days ago _meta_end_dot_

 it will be interesting to hear what they have to say compared to what you state _meta_end_dot_

 yes castro was a dictator _meta_end_dot_

 so what _meta_end_question_

 does he love cuba _meta_end_question_

 unquestionably _meta_end_dot_

 has cuba been hurt by his rule _meta_end_dot_

 indirectly _meta_end_dot_

 the f cking u s _meta_end_dot_

 economic boycott would ruin any country _meta_end_dot_

 but cuba is likely a better place today than it would have been with _meta_number_ref_ years of democracy and u s _meta_end_dot_

 capitalism _meta_end_dot_

 i know it is hard for ignorant americans to grasp but capitalism might not be the best way _meta_end_dot_

 constant growth is insanity when you live in closed system like every human does _meta_end_dot_

 castro tried a different way _meta_end_dot_

 a benevolent dictatorship is still the most effective form of government _meta_end_dot_

 the key is benevolent and having a great leader _meta_end_dot_

 without that it is a disaster _meta_end_dot_

 castro was such a great leader _meta_end_dot_

 voter my friend has traveled to cuba _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ times every year for a very long time _meta_end_dot_

 while there he stays with his friends _meta_end_dot_

 he reports his friends in their _meta_number_ref_ s dearly love castro _meta_end_dot_

 they also would like to see better relations with the usa but not under bush _meta_end_dot_

 they consider bush to be pure evil _meta_end_dot_

 also they ask my friend why americans didn t have a revolution when the supreme court put bush into power _meta_end_question_

 or when bush entered iraq illegally and killed thousands of innocent people _meta_end_question_

 also they do not want any us businesses to be in their country _meta_end_dot_

 they do not trust american businesses but do trust european and canadian companies _meta_end_dot_

 cubans may well love castro more for stepping down from power because they will view it as being a very loving act _meta_end_dot_

 us embargoes to them show america s imperialism _meta_end_dot_

 and cubans are very proud of their schools and hospitals _meta_end_dot_

 our country s future friendship with cuba will likely depend upon what we want from them _meta_end_dot_

 our historical approach of what is in it for us vs what is good for a particular country will come under scrutiny _meta_end_dot_

 and it should _meta_end_dot_
