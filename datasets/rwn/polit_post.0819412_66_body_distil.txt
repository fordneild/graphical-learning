  in the end what do we really have but the legacy we leave and the glory of god that we imperfectly reflect _meta_end_question_

 tony snow has reached the end of his battle with cancer _meta_end_dot_

 tony snow the former white house press secretary and conservative pundit who bedeviled the press corps and charmed millions as a fox news television and radio host died after a long bout with cancer _meta_end_dot_

 he was _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 a syndicated columnist editor tv anchor radio show host and musician snow worked in nearly every medium in a career that spanned more than _meta_number_ref_ years _meta_end_dot_

 laura and i are deeply saddened by the death of our dear friend tony snow president bush said in a statement _meta_end_dot_

 the snow family has lost a beloved husband and father _meta_end_dot_

 and america has lost a devoted public servant and a man of character snow died at _meta_number_ref_ a m _meta_end_dot_

 saturday at georgetown university hospital in washington d c _meta_end_dot_

 tony snow lived his life with a cheerful energetic awareness of its transience both before and after his cancer diagnosis _meta_end_dot_

 he didn t have to change who he was when he learned of the illness that took his life _meta_end_dot_

 he was already there _meta_end_dot_

 of course tony snow leaves a political legacy but there s a reason why i m not focusing on that right now _meta_end_dot_

 i honestly believe that his legacy as a man of faith and as a man who faced cancer with optimism and bravery will outshine his political legacy in the end _meta_end_dot_

 anyone can be a press secretary and tony snow was a great one but tony snow was well centered and well grounded in life s most important values before during and at the end of his cancer battle _meta_end_dot_

 if you want a feel for what i believe is tony snow s most important legacy read the full text of tony snow s commencement address to the catholic university of america a speech he gave after he had a recurrence of cancer _meta_end_dot_

 i ve called it a home run of the heart i ll leave you with a few excerpts in tony s own words you begin to confront the truly overwhelming question why am i here _meta_end_question_

 and that begins to open up the whole universe because it impels you to think like the child staring out at the starry night who put the lights in the sky _meta_end_question_

 who put me here _meta_end_question_

 why and pretty soon you are thinking about god _meta_end_dot_

 don t shrink from pondering god s role in the universe or christ s _meta_end_dot_

 you see it s trendy to reject religious reflection as a grave offense against decency _meta_end_dot_

 that s not only cowardly _meta_end_dot_

 that s false _meta_end_dot_

 faith and reason are knitted together in the human soul _meta_end_dot_

 so don t leave home without either one _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 american culture likes to celebrate the petulant outcast the smart aleck with the contempt for everything and faith in nothing _meta_end_dot_

 snarky mavericks _meta_end_dot_

 the problem is these guys are losers _meta_end_dot_

 they have signed up for an impossible mission _meta_end_dot_

 because they ve decided they re going to create all the meaning in their lives _meta_end_dot_

 they ve either decided that no moral law exists or they will be the creator the author of those laws _meta_end_dot_

 now one road leads to complete and total anarchy _meta_end_dot_

 life is solitary nasty brutish and short _meta_end_dot_

 the other is to insanity since it requires playing god _meta_end_dot_

 we know in our hearts intuitively from our first years as children that the universe unfolds with a discernable order and that moral laws far from being convenient social conventions are firm and unalterable _meta_end_dot_

 they predate us they will survive us _meta_end_dot_

 rather than admitting our weakness a lot of times we just decide we ll try to get by _meta_end_dot_

 and maybe rather than giving god credit we ll try to look for a cheap substitute _meta_end_dot_

 walk into a bookstore you ll know what i mean _meta_end_dot_

 the shelves are groaning underneath the trendy tomes promising salvation medicine balls herbs purges all sorts of weird stuff _meta_end_dot_

 in politics there s a variant that elevates government to the status of god _meta_end_dot_

 it says that it is the source of love _meta_end_dot_

 it ought to be the recipient of your tithes but government while it does pursue compassionate ends cannot be loving and personal _meta_end_dot_

 it treats all of us as completely equal rather than uniquely divine _meta_end_dot_

 the point is you can t escape the question of god and you can t escape the question of commitments _meta_end_dot_

 when it comes to faith i ve taken my own journey _meta_end_dot_

 you will have to take your own _meta_end_dot_

 but here s what i know _meta_end_dot_

 faith is as natural as the air we breathe _meta_end_dot_

 religion is not an opiate just the opposite _meta_end_dot_

 it is the introduction to the ultimate extreme sport _meta_end_dot_

 there is nothing that you can imagine that god cannot trump _meta_end_dot_

 as paul said faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen and once you realize that there is something greater than you out there then you have to decide do i acknowledge it and do i act upon it you have to at some point surrender yourself _meta_end_dot_

 and there is nothing worthwhile in your life that will not at some point require an act of submission _meta_end_dot_

 it s true of faith and friendship _meta_end_dot_

 it is a practical passage of the bible especially to marriage _meta_end_dot_

 tolstoy once said all happy marriages are happy in the same way and here s what he meant _meta_end_dot_

 when both people commit when they say you and i are bound together forever period no questions no codicils no pre nups no escape clauses then all of a sudden the temptations become irrelevant and the glories become possible _meta_end_dot_

 there is nothing like the pleasure of being a parent _meta_end_dot_

 waking up the next morning to somebody whose breath has become the echo of your heartbeat _meta_end_dot_

 trust me on this it does not get any better _meta_end_dot_

 commit _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 finally love _meta_end_dot_

 how trite is that _meta_end_question_

 but it s everything _meta_end_dot_

 it separates happiness from misery _meta_end_dot_

 it separates the full life from the empty life _meta_end_dot_

 to love is to acknowledge that life is not about you _meta_end_dot_

 i want you to remember that it s not about you _meta_end_dot_

 it s a hard lesson _meta_end_dot_

 a lot of people go through life and never learn it _meta_end_dot_

 it s to submit willingly heart and soul to things that matter _meta_end_dot_

 love is not melodrama _meta_end_dot_

 you don t purchase it you don t manufacture it _meta_end_dot_

 you build it _meta_end_dot_

 every time i buy something gaudy for my wife she says oh that s nice and then it goes away someplace _meta_end_dot_

 the love letters she keeps i don t know where the jewelry is _meta_end_dot_

 love springs from small deeds the gestures that say casually and naturally i care that acknowledge what s special about somebody else _meta_end_dot_

 if somebody s smarter quicker better prettier wiser than you tell them _meta_end_dot_

 learn from them _meta_end_dot_

 don t be jealous _meta_end_dot_

 glory in it _meta_end_dot_

 to love is to place others before you and to make their needs your priority _meta_end_dot_

 do it _meta_end_dot_

 when you put somebody else at the center of the frame your entire world changes and for the better _meta_end_dot_

 you begin to find your own place in the world _meta_end_dot_

 when you re drawn into the lives of others you enter their problems their hopes their dreams their families _meta_end_dot_

 they whisk you down unimagined corridors toward possibilities that had been hidden to you before _meta_end_dot_

 so resolve to do little things for others _meta_end_dot_

 you don t know where they re going to lead but then again you don t have any idea where your life is going to lead _meta_end_dot_

 when i was your age i had long hair a beard and thought of myself as a socialist _meta_end_dot_

 you are going to pinball all over the place from experience to experience job to job _meta_end_dot_

 and i want you to remember that you ve got company _meta_end_dot_

 and that if you engage them with heart and mind with faith and energy you are going to find yourself on a cresting wave _meta_end_dot_

 it ll carry you forward and it ll push you under water from time to time _meta_end_dot_

 and some day in the dim and distant future when you re looking back at it you re not going to think about your car or your career or your gold watch _meta_end_dot_

 you ll think about a chewed up teddy bear you had as a baby or maybe your child s smile on a special christmas morning _meta_end_dot_

 the only things that are sure to endure are the artifacts of love _meta_end_dot_

 so go out and build as many as you can _meta_end_dot_

 and finally this wherever you are and whatever you do never forget at this moment and every moment forward you have a precious blessing _meta_end_dot_

 you ve got the breath of life _meta_end_dot_

 no matter how lousy things may seem you ve got the breath of life _meta_end_dot_

 and while god doesn t promise tomorrow he does promise eternity _meta_end_dot_

 let me make a confession i ve never been happier than i am today not because i got this wonderful fancy degree _meta_end_dot_

 but because the tips that i ve been sharing with you are leading me toward my next graduation _meta_end_dot_

 flip the tassle to the other side tony _meta_end_dot_

 you ve graduated and we couldn t be prouder _meta_end_dot_
