  gee how would you feel every time you turned over a new month on this calender _meta_end_question_

 ooooh she s hot but oh wait depressing _meta_end_exclamation_

 you better hurry because the last batch of ron paul pinup calendars is going quickly _meta_end_dot_

 which pleases juliet annerino no end because she sank a sizable chunk of her own change into printing up hundreds of these calendars to help fund the campaign of her favorite politician _meta_end_dot_

 you ve already missed miss january lisa kelly a lifelong democrat and mother of two who never dreamed she d be posing in a slip to help a _meta_number_ref_ year old _meta_number_ref_ term republican congressman in his hopeless run for the white house _meta_end_dot_

 actually that s her as miss liberty _meta_end_dot_

 far be it from me to discourage nearly naked hotties from making political calenders _meta_end_dot_

 actually i think we could use a little more of that but you know ron paul is not only finished in the presidential race he s struggling to hold on to his congressional seat in a primary battle against chris peden you can contribute to peden here _meta_end_dot_

 so if you re a ron paul fan who has this calender each new month is just going to be another reminder that ron paul is not going to be president _meta_end_dot_

 ps _meta_number_ref_ it could be worse ps _meta_number_ref_ the clare boothe luce policy institute has a conservative calender out called damsels in success a calendar _meta_end_dot_

 it s more a conservative woman s role model calender than a cheesecake thing but it has some hotties in there like michelle malkin ann coulter and my buddy amanda carpenter _meta_end_dot_
