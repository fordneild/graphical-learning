  whether it s michael j _meta_end_dot_

 fox talking about embryonic stem cells cindy sheehan talking about the war in iraq or max cleland being trotted out to flack for john kerry there s nothing liberals love better than a spokesman that you re not supposed to be able to argue with _meta_end_dot_

 the latest person who s supposed to be able to say whatever she wants without anyone being able to respond to her is apparently michelle obama who inspired this drivel from dick durbin well i know michelle she s been my friend a friend of my wife for many many years _meta_end_dot_

 she can take it _meta_end_dot_

 she can handle herself _meta_end_dot_

 she s a very accomplished person _meta_end_dot_

 but i will tell you this the hottest ring in hell is reserved for those in politics who attack their opponents families _meta_end_dot_

 and if there are some republican strategists who think that s the way to win the election i think they re wrong _meta_end_dot_

 setting aside the overheated rhetoric about the hottest ring in hell i would generally agree with durbin that the families of politicians should be left out of political battles _meta_end_dot_

 but the left being the left for the most part at least only sees human decency as something that they can exploit for their own purposes _meta_end_dot_

 so if decent people don t want to attack the families of politicians then use the families of politicians as spokesmen _meta_end_dot_

 then when they re treated like the spokesmen that they are pretend to be shocked and horrified at the whole spectacle _meta_end_dot_

 it s exactly what liberals did with cindy sheehan _meta_end_dot_

 they took a dumb not particularly stable grieving woman and put her on point against the war _meta_end_dot_

 then they showed how much they cared about her by discarding her like a used tea bag once she challenged nancy pelosi and was therefore of no more use to them _meta_end_dot_

 now they want to play the same game with michelle obama _meta_end_dot_

 out on the campaign trail she s going to make an idiot of herself by saying things like america is just downright mean barack obama will require you to work _meta_end_dot_

 he is going to demand that you shed your cynicism _meta_end_dot_

 that you put down your divisions _meta_end_dot_

 that you come out of your isolation that you move out of your comfort zones _meta_end_dot_

 that you push yourselves to be better _meta_end_dot_

 and that you engage _meta_end_dot_

 barack will never allow you to go back to your lives as usual uninvolved uninformed for the first time in my adult lifetime i am really proud of my country _meta_end_dot_

 and not just because barack has done well but because i think people are hungry for change _meta_end_dot_

 and i have been desperate to see our country moving in that direction but if you quote michelle obama or worse yet disagree with her comments then you re a bad person who deserves to be in the hottest ring in hell of course if you get there you probably won t be able to find a place to sit because all the seats will already be filled by liberals who have taken shots at nancy reagan mary cheney laura bush the bush twins and mitt romney and mike huckabee s kids _meta_end_dot_

 update _meta_number_ref_ from the comments section so to recap we can t talk about obama s looney toon wife that s an attack _meta_end_dot_

 we can t talk about his racist church that s a distraction _meta_end_dot_

 we can t talk about his racist pastor that s guilt by association _meta_end_dot_

 we can t say obama s middle name that s a racial epithet _meta_end_dot_

 we can t talk about the flag pin that s a smear _meta_end_dot_

 we can t call him a liberal that s labeling _meta_end_dot_

 we can t question his ultra liberal views that s an attempt to distract us from the issues that affect our lives _meta_end_dot_

 we can t question his commitment to the war on terror that s an attempt to play on our fears _meta_end_dot_

 we can t talk about his plan to appease terrorist states that s a negative personal attack _meta_end_dot_

 we can t talk about his chicago background or his association with weather underground or tony rezko that s pouncing on every gaffe and association and fake controversy _meta_end_dot_

 can we still make fun of his ears b_hussein_obama
