  w illiam yeatman an energy policy analyst for the competitive enterprise institute asks how long can america on the one hand say we re sick and tried of high gasoline prices and on the other hand say we re not going to do anything about it we re not going to tap our own resources yeatman said _meta_end_dot_

 we re going to be the only industrialized nation that keeps itself from its own resources or more succinctly we ve got the supply yeatman said _meta_end_dot_

 why not tap into it well there are all sorts of excuses and they ve been used to do a number of things over the decades _meta_end_dot_

 stop drilling derail nuclear power and prohibit the building of new refineries _meta_end_dot_

 here s an example of argument which claims to explain away drilling in anwr anwr is estimated to be able to produce two million barrels of oil a day _meta_end_dot_

 since america uses about _meta_number_ref_ million barrels a day thats a pretty impressive amount _meta_end_dot_

 the problem is that that the alaskan pipeline can only transport _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ million barrels a day and its already moving an average of _meta_number_ref_k barrels a day which means its remaining capacity for carrying oil produced from drilling at anwr would be _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ barrels on average _meta_end_dot_

 thats still a good bit _meta_end_dot_

 however the additional problem is that since crude oil s price is set by a world wide market that currently consumes roughly _meta_number_ref_ million barrels a day _meta_end_dot_

 so even if all of anwr s oil is used only by americans say through a clause in the drilling rights lease then it would only offset an equivalent amount of imported oil a good thing however it would only represent a _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ percent increase in global supply thereby resulting in an equal price drop _meta_end_dot_

 with gas currently at four dollars a gallon that would only equal a _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ cent per gallon decrease in prices _meta_end_dot_

 of course it would never occur to this person that perhaps an upgrade of the capacity of the pipeline is possible or that _meta_number_ref_ million barrels a day is _meta_percent_ref_ of our daily total of which about _meta_percent_ref_ is imported _meta_end_dot_

 there s also the argument which claims anwr wouldn t be on line for _meta_number_ref_ years an our crisis is now _meta_end_dot_

 of course that s the same argument that was made _meta_number_ref_ years ago and our crisis is worse isn t it _meta_end_question_

 consider as well that anwr would be only part of the solution _meta_end_dot_

 so the argument that it would only equal _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ cents on a gallon isn t a particularly convincing one _meta_end_dot_

 it is the cumulative reduction from a number of sources that would bring oil prices down _meta_end_dot_

 for instance couple anwr s contribution with what is available on the outer continental shelf ots the interior department s minerals management service determined in february _meta_number_ref_ that approximately _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ billion barrels of undiscovered technically recoverable oil could be found on the outer continental shelf _meta_end_dot_

 do you think recovering _meta_number_ref_ billion barrels of oil might cut our foreign oil dependency a bit and lower oil prices _meta_end_question_

 of course nothing is going on toward that recovery because congress in _meta_number_ref_ passed the outer continental shelf ocs moratorium which has prevented leasing for the purposes of recovering fossil fuels _meta_end_dot_

 and oil shale _meta_end_question_

 america s oil shale reserves are enormous totaling at least _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ trillion barrels of oil _meta_end_dot_

 that s five times the reserves of saudi arabia _meta_end_exclamation_

 and yet no one is producing commercial quantities of oil from these vast deposits _meta_end_dot_

 there sitting under wyoming utah and colorado is enough oil for complete oil independence for this country for decades _meta_end_dot_

 while we get our alternative energy act together _meta_end_dot_

 yet it continues to just sit there _meta_end_dot_

 shell has developed a method to remove it and as even told congress about it back in _meta_number_ref_ but a new technology has emerged that may begin to tap the oil shale s potential _meta_end_dot_

 royal dutch shell in fact has recently completed a demonstration project the mahogany ridge project in which it produced _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ barrels of oil from shale in the ground without mining the shale at all _meta_end_dot_

 instead shell utilized a process called in situ mining which heats the shale while it s still in the ground to got that last little point _meta_end_question_

 _meta_percent_ref_ of all the acreage in which shale oil exists is controlled by the federal government _meta_end_dot_

 it is a complex process which is described at the link _meta_end_dot_

 and because of the complexity of the process there is more work to be done to make it commercially viable _meta_end_dot_

 but given the vast amount of oil available coupled with the high price of oil and the promise of oil independence if properly exploited it would seem the incentive for both industry and government to make that process commercially viable already exists _meta_end_dot_

 but that doesn t seem to be the case does it _meta_end_question_

 congress still has its collective head up its posterior _meta_end_dot_

 yesterday congress again voted down ots drilling _meta_end_dot_

 democrats who had previously supported ots drilling changed their minds and voted with their party to nix the possibility of such drilling rep _meta_end_dot_

 john peterson r pa spearheaded the effort _meta_end_dot_

 his proposal would open up u s _meta_end_dot_

 waters between _meta_number_ref_ and _meta_number_ref_ miles off shore for drilling _meta_end_dot_

 the first _meta_number_ref_ miles off shore would be left alone _meta_end_dot_

 but the plan failed wednesday on a _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ party line vote in a house appropriations subcommittee which was considering the proposal as part of an interior department spending package _meta_end_dot_

 of course i can promise you it will be these very same democrats who will jump in front of the first camera available and lament the high price of oil all the while being directly responsible for it staying in the _meta_dollor_ref_ a barrel area _meta_end_dot_

 and as noted before we get the usual argument from the environmentalists it would take anywhere from seven to _meta_number_ref_ years to bring those resources to shore to have any measurable impact on supply binns said advocating renewable energy sources _meta_end_dot_

 the same song and dance we ve heard since _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 imagine what shape we d be in if we d been bringing a few million barrels a day of those _meta_number_ref_ billion ots barrels available for the past few decades _meta_end_question_

 so what can you expect from your presidential candidates _meta_end_question_

 well barack obama is easy no drilling _meta_end_dot_

 he s into ethanol obama explained why he opposed domestic oil drilling in his bestselling book the audacity of hope we cannot drill our way out of the problem obama wrote adding over the last _meta_number_ref_ years countries like brazil have used a mix of regulation and direct government investment to develop a bio fuel industry _meta_number_ref_ percent of its new vehicles run on sugar based ethanol the problems of such a switch get nothing more than a hand wave from him _meta_end_dot_

 he essentially ignores the available for the unavailable and apparently thinks that we have _meta_number_ref_ years in which to make such a switch _meta_end_dot_

 what we do in the interim apparently is suffer _meta_end_dot_

 he has absolutely no short term solution _meta_end_dot_

 and mccain _meta_end_question_

 well he s a bit harder to figure out _meta_end_dot_

 recently speaking of mccain lindsey graham said on abc s this week with george stephanopoulos sen _meta_end_dot_

 lindsey graham r s c a mccain friend and supporter said the arizona republican would be open to talking about looking for oil and gas in our own backyard john mccain would allow offshore explorations if the states consent graham said sunday _meta_end_dot_

 that apparently is the same position that mccain took on a league of conservation voters last year _meta_end_dot_

 of course it really puts the decision in the hands of the states instead of the federal government and gives mccain the ability to shrug off any refusal as their right to do so but i have to wonder what state claims and enforces the _meta_number_ref_ mile limit now in force _meta_end_dot_

 at a town hall meeting in michigan last month mccain said he believed the united states should expand its domestic oil drilling operations but said the states ought to have the right to make the decision whether to drill or not to drill reuters reported _meta_end_dot_

 it is difficult to gauge mccain s past voting record on domestic drilling mainly because in many instances he did not vote _meta_end_dot_

 in march _meta_number_ref_ mccain did not vote either for or against on an amendment to increase spending levels on energy related programs including the development of oil and natural gas resources in coastal areas not covered by presidential or congressional moratoria _meta_end_dot_

 on the same day mccain did not vote regarding an amendment to increase spending levels on programs to develop natural gas off the coast of virginia and to develop oil shale resources on public lands _meta_end_dot_

 in june _meta_number_ref_ mccain did not vote either for or against on an amendment to allow the governor of virginia to petition the secretary of the interior department to permit natural gas exploration and extraction off its coast _meta_end_dot_

 but mccain did vote in _meta_number_ref_ in support of an amendment to keep the arctic national wildlife refuge anwr closed to oil drilling _meta_end_dot_

 so there you have it a short term energy solution right in front of our faces _meta_end_dot_

 yeatman s question of we ve got the supply why not tap into it remains unanswered _meta_end_dot_

 and as a consequence oil prices continue to rise consumer prices continue to rise and the economy begins to falter _meta_end_dot_

 all of it a condition of our own making _meta_end_dot_

 congress has made foolish decisions over the years by prohibiting exploitation of vast oil resources within our borders or control _meta_end_dot_

 and we have one presidential candidate who refuses to consider tapping into them instead he ll institute windfall profits taxes which will only drive gas prices higher and another who is so wishy washy you have no idea if he d actually push exploitation if he were elected _meta_end_dot_

 instead we ll hear a lot of promises about the coming revolution in alternative fuels the same promises which have been made since jimmy carter was president _meta_end_dot_

 meanwhile expect the price of oil to continue to climb while those that can afford it the least suffer the consequences of our nation s inept politicians and their brilliant energy policies and don t get me started on nuclear energy and refineries _meta_end_dot_
