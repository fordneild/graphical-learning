  my friend pamela geller offers in somewhat more polemic language than i would use a nonetheless compelling antidote to the largely unexamined conception to some extent uncritically passed along by me that barack obama has serious intellectual achievements of which he can rightly boast _meta_end_dot_

 i very much appreciate the point _meta_end_dot_

 it s one i began to ponder at about the same time her post went up just by coincidence _meta_end_dot_

 i recalled that like bill clinton barack obama was a law professor at one point and that clinton too was frequently cited by supporters as a genius a genuine intellectual brilliant as they say _meta_end_dot_

 my thinking regarding both of them was the same intellectuals may achieve many things but if they are truly intellectuals there is inevitably some novel or at least rigorous contribution to some art science philosophy or other body of thought powered endeavor such as law by which that intellection may be proved and measured _meta_end_dot_

 and in the case of both men the comparison keeps coming up there is neither _meta_end_dot_

 there is no book or book chapter no judicial opinion in a case where one of them acted as counsel no published article in a scholarly or professional work _meta_end_dot_

 there is not even a genuinely original great work of oratory or say a riveting course pack _meta_end_dot_

 intellectuals are as intellectuals do _meta_end_dot_

 bill and barack utilized their credentials as they had every right to and as almost everyone else does as stepping stones toward the realization of their grand ambitions _meta_end_dot_

 but neither of them can in any way be credited as having demonstrated a genius for anything other than achievement of that ambition _meta_end_dot_

 and this is not the same we should recall as a genius for leadership or government with which we might credit a franklin delano roosevelt john f _meta_end_dot_

 kennedy or ronald reagan _meta_end_dot_

 neither man can be credited with being the moving or creative force behind the building of any great institution public or private of a noteworthy government program initiative or policy or a political movement that transcended the political institutions of their time and place _meta_end_dot_

 there is no reason that a president must be any of these things _meta_end_dot_

 do not offer _meta_end_dot_

 no one ever burdened john mccain with the title of brilliant genius or intellectual and he therefore need not defend himself on those scores _meta_end_dot_

 there is however a consistent bias among liberals to believe that because as they cannot but see it their causes are the ones most creditable to reason and intellect that their candidates even the most obviously dull ivy league graduates are the thinking person s choice _meta_end_dot_

 of course by contrast their adversaries are chimps dullards genial national hosts _meta_end_dot_

 this contrast democrats smart republicans dumb is consistently echoed by a press corps which outside mainly the new york times wouldn t by dint of its own intellectual or academic achievements know a genuinely original or scholarly insight if you whispered it right into their earpieces _meta_end_dot_

 so be it _meta_end_dot_

 it is worthwhile to read pam s piece however screechy it is is this not her charm to get another side of the obama as brilliant meme _meta_end_dot_

 little by little the reality of the very humanness of this young undeniably bright politician is replacing the messianic fervor and massive mythologizing of only a few months ago _meta_end_dot_

 he may yet be president after all _meta_end_dot_

 and if he ever is frankly reducing him to human scale is probably doing him a favor _meta_end_dot_

 originally posted at likelihood of success _meta_end_dot_
