  john hawkins aptly establishes that barack obama is an out of touch snob about american kids learning spanish _meta_end_dot_

 there is something more to all this though _meta_end_dot_

 obama ignores what makes a person a success in the world today _meta_end_dot_

 if there is any one factor that will contribute to a person s success no matter where he or she lives in the world it is speaking reading and effectively communicating in english _meta_end_dot_

 at one time an educated person intent on doing business and influencing thoughts and ideas had to speak french _meta_end_dot_

 today it is english _meta_end_dot_

 if obama wants to name a problem in america since he s throwing pot shots it should be that american children are woefully ignorant in english fundamentals _meta_end_dot_

 sure they can speak it yo but in order to succeed a person must speak it fluently intelligibly and articulately _meta_end_dot_

 why in order to succeed it wouldn t be a bad idea to emulate barack obama himself when it comes to the use and expression of english _meta_end_dot_

 as far as americans being stupid _meta_end_dot_

 close minded rubes with no world interest _meta_end_dot_

 well _meta_end_dot_

 obama is just displaying his arrogant contempt for the average american once again _meta_end_dot_

 many americans know second and third languages _meta_end_dot_

 i ve had five years of french myself _meta_end_dot_

 and guess what _meta_end_question_

 twenty years ago when i was in paris i spoke french and the snooty french people said this i _meta_end_dot_

 speak _meta_end_dot_

 english _meta_end_dot_

 thank _meta_end_dot_

 you c est la vie _meta_end_exclamation_

 i tried _meta_end_dot_

 the frenchmen seemed determined to use the modern language of business and that s english _meta_end_dot_

 french is a beautiful language _meta_end_dot_

 spanish is great to swear in _meta_end_dot_

 if a person wants to connect to the rest of the world though he needs to speak english _meta_end_dot_

 obama needs to embrace the preeminence of america and her culture _meta_end_dot_

 america is still the superpower and english is this superpower s language at least until barack obama is finished with it _meta_end_dot_
