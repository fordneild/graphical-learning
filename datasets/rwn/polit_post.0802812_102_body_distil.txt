  one of my guest bloggers covered this story over the week end but i had just had to jump in on it anyway _meta_end_dot_

 incidentally this story comes from britain where they already have the sort of socialized medicine that democrats are so in love with doctors are calling for nhs treatment to be withheld from patients who are too old or who lead unhealthy lives _meta_end_dot_

 smokers heavy drinkers the obese and the elderly should be barred from receiving some operations according to doctors with most saying the health service cannot afford to provide free care to everyone _meta_end_dot_

 the findings of a survey conducted by doctor magazine sparked a fierce row last night with the british medical association and campaign groups describing the recommendations from family and hospital doctors as out rageous and disgraceful _meta_end_dot_

 about one in _meta_number_ref_ hospitals already deny some surgery to obese patients and smokers with restrictions most common in hospitals battling debt _meta_end_dot_

 managers defend the policies because of the higher risk of complications on the operating table for unfit patients _meta_end_dot_

 but critics believe that patients are being denied care simply to save money _meta_end_dot_

 among the survey of _meta_number_ref_ family and hospital doctors almost _meta_number_ref_ per cent said the nhs could not provide full healthcare to everyone and that some individuals should pay for services _meta_end_dot_

 one in three said that elderly patients should not be given free treatment if it were unlikely to do them good for long _meta_end_dot_

 half thought that smokers should be denied a heart bypass while a quarter believed that the obese should be denied hip replacements _meta_end_dot_

 tony calland chairman of the bma s ethics committee said it would be outrageous to limit care on age grounds _meta_end_dot_

 age concern called the doctors views disgraceful _meta_end_dot_

 today they re calling this disgraceful but eventually they ll implement it _meta_end_dot_

 why _meta_end_question_

 well you probably care quite a bit about whether you get health care or not but the faceless bureaucrats who run these programs _meta_end_question_

 not so much _meta_end_dot_

 they talk a good game but to them this is ultimately just another way to get more tax dollars and power under the thumb of the government _meta_end_dot_

 moreover the population in britain like the population here is rapidly getting older and socialized medicine wastes resources _meta_end_dot_

 that means there is less not more to go around _meta_end_dot_

 they ve been getting around that so far by having interminably long waits for some operations the point being that some people will have the courtesy to die before they get their operation which will save the system money _meta_end_dot_

 but now they re getting to the point where they need to withhold treatment from people people who have paid their tax dollars into the system so that they can be covered mind you to keep the system solvent _meta_end_dot_

 read the whole article and make a mental note of it because it s not just the future of health care in britain it will eventually be the future of health care in the united states if the democrats get their way and we have socialized medicine in this country _meta_end_dot_
