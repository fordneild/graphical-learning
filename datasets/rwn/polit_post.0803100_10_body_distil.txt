  tonight at _meta_number_ref_ pm est i will be liveblogging the gop debate _meta_end_dot_

 if you re planning to tune in and watch come on over to rwn chat in the comments section and refresh regularly to read the commentary _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ is there still a point to having ron paul participating in these debates _meta_end_question_

 i mean if you have ron paul why not alan keyes at this point _meta_end_question_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ mitt almost has no choice except to try to take a big chunk of mccain while mccain can simply be presidential _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ the problem with these debates so far for all the people not named john mccain is that the only debate that made a big difference was the one where hillary made the massive screw up over drivers licenses for illegals _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ mitt i made things better in mass _meta_end_dot_

 when i was there but it s not my responsibility to argue on bush s record _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ americans are better off but things are tough right now _meta_end_dot_

 need stimulus package need to make bush tax cuts permanent eliminate alternate minimum tax i think we are better off overall but a lot of people don t feel better off right now because things aren t going as well _meta_end_dot_

 i agree with that _meta_end_dot_

 mccain had a pretty good answer here _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ huck says we re not better off than we were _meta_number_ref_ years ago _meta_end_dot_

 romney dodges it _meta_end_dot_

 huck is giving the democratic answer wait he s complaining about a _meta_percent_ref_ employment rate _meta_end_question_

 really _meta_end_question_

 that was considered full employment not all that long ago in this country _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ paul we re worse off _meta_end_dot_

 okay how long until this i didn t even have time to finish the sentence until he gets in monetary policy and empire yada yada _meta_end_dot_

 sigh _meta_end_dot_

 he sucks so bad _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ now mitt gets to tear into mccain _meta_end_dot_

 mccain opposed to drilling in anwr voted twice against bush tax cuts authored mccain feingold which has been bad pro amnesty bill mccain lieberman us only imposed cap and trade program on gas _meta_end_dot_

 only we do that _meta_end_dot_

 endorsed by the new york times _meta_end_dot_

 excellent answer _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ geeze mccain is tone def _meta_end_dot_

 he s bragging about being endorsed by a bunch of liberal newspapers _meta_end_dot_

 someone alert him that s not a positive _meta_end_dot_

 romney raised taxes _meta_number_ref_ million job creation was terrible _meta_number_ref_ million dollar debt because of a health care plan mitt lost lots of manufacturing jobs _meta_end_dot_

 mccain didn t answer romney s attack effectively but he bloodied romney in return as well _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ mitt s time _meta_end_dot_

 oh we actually added jobs while i was in office _meta_end_dot_

 i didn t raise fees as much as you said _meta_end_dot_

 mitt defends his record and most people probably have no idea whether it s true or not _meta_end_dot_

 but now the fight is over mitt s record not mccain s _meta_end_dot_

 mccain wins that exchange _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ huck i wish rush loved me like i love rush i believe in lesser government _meta_end_dot_

 lower taxes not higher _meta_end_dot_

 one of the things rush once praised me for was the tax me more fund good answer but the fact rush ripped on him hurts _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ mitt still not good on the defensive and he has been on the defensive a lot _meta_end_dot_

 long answer most people probably zoned out during it _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ mccain do you side with ah nuld or with conservatives _meta_end_question_

 i side with ah nuld because of federalism _meta_end_dot_

 mccain what if ah nuld and i are wrong _meta_end_question_

 what does it hurt _meta_end_question_

 all we ve done is give our kids a greener world _meta_end_dot_

 wrong _meta_end_dot_

 we ve wasted billions of dollars and significantly damaged our country s economy _meta_end_dot_

 mccain is definitely in the gore camp on this _meta_end_dot_

 mccain i would not agree to a global agreement unless china was part of it _meta_end_dot_

 we have to address this non existent issue _meta_end_exclamation_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ we all agree that america should become energy independent i don t _meta_end_dot_

 it s simply not possible with the technology we have _meta_end_dot_

 what mccain is doing is a _meta_percent_ref_ utility tax a _meta_number_ref_ cent tax on gasoline _meta_end_dot_

 then the energy plants move overseas _meta_end_dot_

 they don t call it america warming they call it global warming _meta_end_dot_

 excellent answer from romney there _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ huck i support california on the basis of federalism _meta_end_dot_

 not much from huck on that one _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ ron paul s turn _meta_end_dot_

 we don t talk about property rights and that s the problem here _meta_end_dot_

 anderson rudely blows off ron paul _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ i don t know if huck s stimulus idea is a good one or not but building a highway is certainly a legitimate use of government funds _meta_end_dot_

 ooooh huck makes an unintentional funny there about the highway _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ investment in infrastructure is good for the country mitt _meta_end_dot_

 the big dig america s biggest carwash _meta_end_question_

 joke falls flat _meta_end_dot_

 way too much talk here without anyone hitting mccain _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ ron paul _meta_end_dot_

 free up the market _meta_end_dot_

 can t expect the government to do everything _meta_end_dot_

 monetary system _meta_end_dot_

 empire _meta_end_dot_

 geep glorp gloop _meta_end_dot_

 he s like a broken record _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_percent_ref_ music _meta_percent_ref_ annoying skips _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ mccain there are greedy people on wall street who need to be punished _meta_end_dot_

 this is pure pandering _meta_end_dot_

 people didn t get fooled they knew what they were doing _meta_end_dot_

 they bought houses they knew they couldn t afford and they got burned by it _meta_end_dot_

 mccain repeats a bunch of conservative talking points that sound good _meta_end_dot_

 ron paul and i agree that spending is out of control _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ good question for mccain _meta_end_dot_

 you said the tax cuts were too skewed to the wealthy and that they weren t paid for _meta_end_dot_

 so what has changed _meta_end_question_

 i disagreed when spending got out of control and guess what spending got of control _meta_end_dot_

 had we done what i had wanted to do we d have gotten spending under control and we d be talking about more spending _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ ronald reagan would have said sign the tax cuts but mccain voted against it _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_percent_ref_ of our spending is for entitlements and it will be _meta_percent_ref_ soon _meta_end_dot_

 the military is _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 we have to deal with entitlements _meta_end_dot_

 we can t fix the problem with the _meta_percent_ref_ that is left over _meta_end_dot_

 we have to change the deal for _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ year olds or we will bankrupt the country _meta_end_dot_

 good answer for mitt _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ huck dodges the anchor baby question _meta_end_dot_

 we need to secure the border _meta_end_dot_

 fence built in _meta_number_ref_ months _meta_end_dot_

 people here need to go to the back of the line and start over _meta_end_dot_

 huck didn t help himself much on this question because it left his stance on amnesty fuzzy _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ mitt my plan is no amnesty for people who are here illegally _meta_end_dot_

 people who have been here _meta_number_ref_ years we let their kids complete the school years before you send them home _meta_end_dot_

 ehr what _meta_end_question_

 how would that even work _meta_end_question_

 you catch them let them go to finish school and you will never see them again _meta_end_dot_

 mitt attacks accurately i might add what mccain s z visa would have done _meta_end_dot_

 not a criminal you get to stay here forever under a z visa _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ mccain if your original plan came to the senate floor would you vote for it _meta_end_question_

 mccain dodges to keep from admitting that he would _meta_end_dot_

 we will secure the borders first _meta_end_dot_

 i will have the border state governors say the borders are secure _meta_end_dot_

 employers will have to hire people who are here legally _meta_end_dot_

 that will cause attrition by enforcement _meta_end_dot_

 we know now we have to secure the borders first _meta_end_dot_

 mccain i will not answer how i would vote on my own bill _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ huckabee won t even say sandra day o connor was the wrong choice _meta_end_question_

 yeesh _meta_end_dot_

 what happened to this guy _meta_end_question_

 he used to be great in these debates _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ ron paul i wouldn t have appointed sandra day o connor _meta_end_dot_

 good answer ron _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ john mccain _meta_end_dot_

 i am proud of o connor but i would appoint people like alito and roberts _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ mitt i would much rather have a justice like alito roberts scalia thomas than o connor _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ commercial break so far no major blows have landed although mccain has had more of his record dragged out here than in previous debates _meta_end_dot_

 i hate to say it especially since i am supporting huck but huck and paul are just wasted space in this debate so far _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ huck seems to be campaigning for veep here and mitt hasn t been nearly aggressive enough _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ peggy noonan bush broke the republican party _meta_end_dot_

 is the gop better off than it was _meta_number_ref_ years ago _meta_end_question_

 mitt no it s not _meta_end_dot_

 not all bush s fault _meta_end_dot_

 really washington s fault _meta_end_dot_

 bush has kept us safe these last _meta_number_ref_ years _meta_end_dot_

 i watch the dems with horror when they say it s more important to get out of iraq than win _meta_end_dot_

 we have overspent in washington _meta_end_dot_

 we did not deal with entitlements _meta_end_dot_

 i think no child left behind takes the ball forward _meta_end_dot_

 good answer for mitt _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ mccain is lying about my setting a specific time for withdrawal _meta_end_dot_

 mccain is a liar _meta_end_dot_

 let me make it absolutely clear mccain is a liar i will not pull our troops out of iraq until we ve gotten the job done _meta_end_dot_

 mccain smirks while this is going on _meta_end_dot_

 it was a dirty trick on mccain s part _meta_end_dot_

 lots of clapping _meta_end_dot_

 good answer _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ mccain well of course he said he wanted a timetable _meta_end_dot_

 mccain mitt wouldn t talk about the surge while i was pushing the surge _meta_end_dot_

 mccain is being sleazy here _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ mitt calls mccain on it _meta_end_dot_

 claps _meta_end_dot_

 now mccain is trying to be slippery _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ cooper reads the quote _meta_end_dot_

 honestly you can interpret that quote from romney as wanting to set a secret timetable _meta_end_dot_

 it s admittedly ambiguous but that is a fair interpretation of it _meta_end_dot_

 more mccain smirking _meta_end_dot_

 wow that is annoying _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ mitt on the surge mccain smirking mitt is obviously royally p o d about mccain dropping that secret timetable charge before florida _meta_end_dot_

 even the new york times admits it s a lie _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ mccain i think my interpretation was right _meta_end_dot_

 also you got a lot of nerve romney using your own money to run all those sleazy negative ads _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ ron paul we shouldn t have even gone into iraq _meta_end_dot_

 empire _meta_end_exclamation_

 wait i have forgotten what question they asked the guy _meta_end_dot_

 does it have anything to do with whatever he s is talking about _meta_end_question_

 i think _meta_end_dot_

 there were al qaeda there ron _meta_end_dot_

 they did commit aggression _meta_end_dot_

 it wasn t unconstitutional _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ mike i didn t come here to umpire a ballgame between these two guys _meta_end_dot_

 we need to leave with honor and victory _meta_end_dot_

 if we leave a bigger mess in iraq it will erupt and give al qaeda and iran to take advantage of the situation _meta_end_dot_

 we can t leave it vulnerable in iraq and we ll have to come back _meta_end_dot_

 really good answer from huckabee _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ mccain it s a false argument _meta_end_dot_

 it s american casualties not american presence _meta_end_dot_

 spot on _meta_end_dot_

 we re not talking about timetables we re talking about winning _meta_end_dot_

 americans will come home with honor _meta_end_dot_

 good answer from mccain _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ huckabee on putin _meta_end_dot_

 people s eyes can lie but their actions don t _meta_end_dot_

 wait was that alan keyes in the audience _meta_end_question_

 back to huckabee _meta_end_dot_

 we need enough troop strength _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ putin is a bad guy _meta_end_dot_

 there are _meta_number_ref_ types of strategies in play _meta_end_dot_

 people using energy resources _meta_end_dot_

 people using communism and wild west capitalism _meta_end_dot_

 then there s al qaeda and then there s us _meta_end_dot_

 that s actually an interesting way of looking at it _meta_end_dot_

 good answer _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ mccain what makes you more capable than mitt to run the economy _meta_end_question_

 leadership vision and then mccain goes into his stump speech _meta_end_dot_

 foreign policy i was a pow i was in the military that s a little too try hard everyone knows he was a soldier he should be getting into fiscal conservatism here soon he didn t _meta_end_question_

 odd _meta_end_dot_

 not a great answer _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ mitt he s a fine man but i am a better economic leader _meta_end_dot_

 i am not a senator _meta_end_dot_

 i spent _meta_number_ref_ years in the private sector _meta_end_dot_

 i turned the olympics around _meta_end_dot_

 i went on to become a governor _meta_end_dot_

 good answer _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ mitt why are you a better commander in chief _meta_end_question_

 i don t think you have to serve to be a great foreign policy leader _meta_end_dot_

 i can bring in the perspectives of the entire world _meta_end_dot_

 abe lincoln wasn t a military expert _meta_end_dot_

 eh he didn t make a good case _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ john mccain _meta_end_dot_

 mitt sometimes made people lose their jobs he s like your boss _meta_end_exclamation_

 blah _meta_end_exclamation_

 that was really hamhanded _meta_end_dot_

 i am ready to step in and lead _meta_end_dot_

 look at all these people who support me _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ paul why would you be the man to run the economy or foreign policy _meta_end_dot_

 paul it s not the job of the president to run the economy _meta_end_dot_

 true but he s not making a case for himself _meta_end_dot_

 we can t print the money out of thin air _meta_end_exclamation_

 commander in chief wise foreign policy not be involved in so many things _meta_end_dot_

 humble foreign policy not policeman of the world _meta_end_dot_

 last part of the answer was coherent not terrible _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ would reagan endorse you mitt _meta_end_question_

 he would _meta_end_dot_

 ronald reagan and i are practically twins and we would agree on every issue _meta_end_dot_

 getting lots of issues out here at least _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ ronald reagan would not approve of someone who changes his position depending on what the year is _meta_end_dot_

 reagan was a man of principles and so he would endorse me _meta_end_dot_

 of course they re very different principles _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ i supported reagan in _meta_number_ref_ and _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 reagan campaigned for me in _meta_number_ref_ and i don t know what he would do but he was very sympathetic to the gold standard _meta_end_dot_

 that would be the key issue _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ it would be presumptive to assume what ronald reagan would be _meta_end_dot_

 i don t know if he d endorse me but i endorse him _meta_end_dot_

 reagan wasn t just about policies it was that he saw this as a great country and he loved this country _meta_end_dot_

 great answer from huckabee _meta_end_dot_

 summary cnn did a decent job _meta_end_dot_

 they brought out more of mccain s record than the other debates did asked some tough questions and overall i have no complaints _meta_end_dot_

 loser ron paul same as always _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_percent_ref_ good stuff _meta_percent_ref_ incoherent babbling about monetary policy empire yada yada yada _meta_end_dot_

 mike huckabee awful in the first half of the debate but he improved a lot in the second half of the debate and finished strong _meta_end_dot_

 he was hurt a bit by not getting as much time as mccain and romney _meta_end_dot_

 john mccain romney definitely scored some points against him and mccain slipped into his canned speech a bit too much _meta_end_dot_

 there was a lot of smirking too which was really annoying _meta_end_dot_

 in my opinion this was a weak performance for mccain but i think he was just trying to play it safe and ride out the momentum of his super tuesday win _meta_end_dot_

 mitt romney winner this is mitt s _meta_number_ref_nd strong performance in a row _meta_end_dot_

 he defeated mccain pretty handily in this debate by pointing out some of mccain s weaknesses and highlighting his own strengths _meta_end_dot_

 on the other hand although mitt won i don t think mccain was damaged enough to hurt him badly on super tuesday _meta_end_dot_

 so a win _meta_end_question_

 yes _meta_end_dot_

 a difference making win _meta_end_question_

 probably not _meta_end_dot_

 ps if you watched the debate let me know who you think won in the poll below who won the debate _meta_end_question_

 ron paul mitt romney mike huckabee john mccain free polls from pollhost com
