  a small group of white power nutjobs apparently came up with some sort of ill conceived meth inspired plot to kill barack obama and happily were caught and will hopefully be sent to prison for the rest of their lives cbs_meta_number_ref_ has learned at least four people are under arrest in connection with a possible plot to kill barack obama at his thursday night acceptance speech in denver _meta_end_dot_

 all are being held on either drug or weapons charges _meta_end_dot_

 cbs_meta_number_ref_ investigator brian maass reported one of the suspects told authorities they were going to shoot obama from a high vantage point using a _meta_end_dot_

 rifle _meta_end_dot_

 sighted at _meta_number_ref_ yards law enforcement sources tell maass that one of the suspects was directly asked if they had come to denver to kill obama _meta_end_dot_

 he responded in the affirmative the story began emerging sunday morning when aurora police arrested _meta_number_ref_ year old tharin gartrell _meta_end_dot_

 he was driving a rented pickup truck in an erratic manner according to sources _meta_end_dot_

 sources told cbs_meta_number_ref_ police found two high powered scoped rifles in the car along with camouflage clothing walkie talkies wigs a bulletproof vest a spotting scope licenses in the names of other people and _meta_number_ref_ grams of methamphetamine _meta_end_dot_

 one of the rifles is listed as stolen from kansas _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 authorities went to the cherry creek hotel to contact an associate of gartrell s _meta_end_dot_

 but that man identified as shawn robert adolph _meta_number_ref_ who was wanted on numerous warrants jumped out of a sixth floor hotel window _meta_end_dot_

 law enforcement sources say adolph broke an ankle in the fall and was captured moments later _meta_end_dot_

 sources say he had a handcuff ring and was wearing a swastika and is thought to have ties to white supremacist organizations _meta_end_dot_

 a third man an associate of gartrell and adolph nathan johnson _meta_number_ref_ was also arrested _meta_end_dot_

 he told authorities that the two men planned to kill barack obama at his acceptance speech the u s _meta_end_dot_

 attorneys office has scheduled a news conference for tuesday afternoon _meta_end_dot_

 the u s _meta_end_dot_

 attorney in denver said it does not believe there is a credible threat to obama or the convention _meta_end_dot_

 it s premature to say that it was a valid threat or that these folks have the ability to carry it out said a u s _meta_end_dot_

 government official familiar with the investigation _meta_end_dot_

 the official spoke on condition of anonymity because the investigation is ongoing _meta_end_dot_

 i know what you re probably thinking these guys are white supremacists who wanted to kill obama does that mean they re hillary supporters _meta_end_question_

 to that i say how unfair these people are obviously fringe scum and someone like hillary isn t responsible for their actions _meta_end_dot_

 of course everyone on the left doesn t see it that way and they re not blaming hillary for this _meta_end_dot_

 look for this meme to get more popular on the left as the day goes on from the booman tribute unfortunately the fact that an african american will be nominated by the democratic party and the vicious attacks by right wing demagogues and the mccain campaign against his character and his patriotism and that of his wife have apparently emboldened some truly dangerous and deranged individuals to try to take matters into their own hands _meta_end_dot_

 this is what happens when the airwaves of this country are saturated with racist and ideological hate speech by right wing ideologues such as hannity limbaugh and savage _meta_end_dot_

 yes that ideological hate speech is supposed to be leading to violence _meta_end_dot_

 guess we better implement the fairness doctrine to get those conservatives off the air so they can t say anything negative about liberals at all _meta_end_dot_

 meanwhile liberals are screaming kill michelle malkin in the streets of denver and chasing her around but obviously they weren t hoping to inspire anyone to hurt her when they said that or so they d claim _meta_end_dot_

 ps at one point mccain wasn t even taking secret service protection _meta_end_dot_

 i think this event shows that s simply not possible in these days and times _meta_end_dot_
