  on thursday of last week mitt finally gave a much anticipated speech on religious freedom and the mormon religion _meta_end_dot_

 although the reviews of the speech were not universally positive they were very good and they were everywhere in the blogosphere on talk radio and even at the top of the drudge report _meta_end_dot_

 even though only a relatively small number of republicans actually heard the speech you have to figure given the coverage that it received that a large number of them heard positive things about the speech _meta_end_dot_

 so did mitt get a bounce out of the speech _meta_end_question_

 according to the rasmussen reports daily tracking poll not so much _meta_end_dot_

 on the day he gave the speech he was at _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 since then he has been at _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 does a _meta_percent_ref_ increase even count as a bounce _meta_end_question_

 not really and that s bad news _meta_end_dot_

 let me tell you why _meta_end_dot_

 initially my thought was that mitt would probably get a temporary bounce from the speech and then would go back to normal _meta_end_dot_

 however given that mitt didn t even get the sort of temporary bounce you d expect from a glut of positive coverage i think john podhoretz may have been right and mitt may have damaged himself with the speech _meta_end_dot_

 in other words as i wrote on friday so according to the study evangelicals who are an extremely large and important group of primary voters dislike mormons almost as much as atheists but half the country including presumably half the evangelicals didn t know romney was a mormon _meta_end_dot_

 in other words in effect what romney may have just done with the speech is run an enormous negative ad against himself that could after the bump he gets from the positive speech coverage cause him to dip below his previous numbers time will tell if that theory is correct _meta_end_dot_
