  the huffington post is the world s largest liberal blog and is generally considered to be even more mainstream than the daily kos _meta_end_dot_

 although it may be true that they re generally not quite as venomous or conspiratorial the bubbleheaded celebrity crowd has helped produce some particularly vacuous posts this year some of which you ll find below _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ bush should commute michael vick s sentence there are many cultures in the world that accept and promote cruelty to animals _meta_end_dot_

 in some countries of hispanic origin bullfighting is promoted as a national sport _meta_end_dot_

 and dogs are eaten in some asian countries _meta_end_dot_

 it is my understanding that dog fighting is part of the african american culture despite the fact that it is a federal crime _meta_end_dot_

 that does not make it right but it does explain in part vick s participation in this event sheldon drobny _meta_number_ref_ a poet once wrote you can take the boy out of ratf cking but you can t take the ratf cking out of the boy so true _meta_end_dot_

 karl rove is one of those legendary mythological creatures half doughy man boy half ratf cker _meta_end_dot_

 it s his nature _meta_end_dot_

 once a ratf cker always a ratf cker _meta_end_dot_

 remove the bush white house from the equation and he ll be ratf cking all over the place _meta_end_dot_

 ratf cking in the private sector _meta_end_dot_

 ratf cking at the mall _meta_end_dot_

 ratf cking in the self checkout aisle at the grocery store bob cesca _meta_number_ref_ abortion ban virginia massacre don t forget to thank the nader voters there are so many people to thank when the supreme court strikes down an integral part of a woman s constitutional right to abortion _meta_end_dot_

 and in the same week a psychotically disturbed student is allowed to buy guns and bullets without any background check _meta_end_dot_

 so we would be remiss if we didn t thank ralph nader and all the progressives who voted for that selfless individual in _meta_number_ref_ and _meta_number_ref_ martin lewis on the massacre committed by cho seung hui _meta_number_ref_ i was midway through my morning walk with my dog _meta_end_dot_

 hudson _meta_end_dot_

 we make the same loop around our neighborhood every day for the most part a quiet winding road up and around our little enclave within coldwater canon _meta_end_dot_

 and then i walked past a guy sitting in his bentley talking on the cell phone while his engine idling _meta_end_dot_

 and that pissed me off _meta_end_dot_

 me hey _meta_end_dot_

 why don t you turn your car off while you re just sitting there _meta_end_dot_

 note to self a simple please gets you places douche bag in bentley vroom vroom he guns his engine to make very intimidating manly noise as if to tell me off _meta_end_dot_

 me turn off your car what s your problem _meta_end_question_

 dib why don t you get a job so you can find a better way to spend your time other than harassing people _meta_end_question_

 me are you kidding me _meta_end_question_

 why don t you take your small penis car out of my neighborhood you douche bag _meta_end_question_

 he then peeled away from the curb and yelled out the window at me as i walked away that i probably had some movie deal waiting for me at home and why didn t i go deal with it which i found remotely amusing and completely irrelevant _meta_end_dot_

 suzy shuster _meta_number_ref_ we re a nation divided and i don t understand the sanctimonious calls for bipartisanship for reaching out to our brothers and sisters across the aisle _meta_end_dot_

 there were good germans who reached out to nazis there were good americans who reached out to the southern slave holders but some evils don t lend themselves to feel good compromise they must be defeated frank dwyer _meta_number_ref_ you could argue that even the world s worst fascist dictators at least meant well _meta_end_dot_

 they honestly thought were doing good things for their countries by suppressing blacks eliminating jews eradicating free enterprise repressing individual thought killing off rivals invading neighbors etc _meta_end_dot_

 only the saudi royal family is driven by the same motives as bush but they were already entrenched _meta_end_dot_

 bush set a new precedent _meta_end_dot_

 he came into office with the attitude of i m so tired of the public good _meta_end_dot_

 what about my good _meta_end_question_

 what about my rich friends good how can anyone not see it _meta_end_question_

 it s not that the bush administrations policies have been misguided or haven t played out right _meta_end_dot_

 they _meta_end_dot_

 don t _meta_end_dot_

 even _meta_end_dot_

 mean _meta_end_dot_

 well _meta_end_dot_

 peter mehlman _meta_number_ref_ i propose a limitation be put on how many squares of toilet paper can be used in any one sitting _meta_end_dot_

 now i don t want to rob any law abiding american of his or her god given rights but i think we are an industrious enough people that we can make it work with only one square per restroom visit except of course on those pesky occasions where _meta_number_ref_ to _meta_number_ref_ could be required _meta_end_dot_

 when presenting this idea to my younger brother whose judgment i trust implicitly he proposed taking it one step further _meta_end_dot_

 i believe his quote was how bout just washing the one square out _meta_end_dot_

 i also like the idea of not using paper napkins which happen to be made from virgin wood and represent the height of wastefulness _meta_end_dot_

 i have designed a clothing line that has what s called a dining sleeve the sleeve is detachable and can be replaced with another dining sleeve after usage _meta_end_dot_

 the design will offer the diner the convenience of wiping his mouth on his sleeve rather than throwing out yet another barely used paper product _meta_end_dot_

 i think this idea could also translate quite well to those suffering with an annoying head cold sheryl crow _meta_number_ref_ democrat flaks jump on this like ducks on a june bug and in the process themselves reproduce the sick militarism of this culture that automatically valorizes anyone who wears a uniform _meta_end_dot_

 how dare you insult a soldier _meta_end_exclamation_

 like its some sacred calling instead of an imperial employment program steeped in the culture of machismo and misogyny and you can gasp as theatrically as you want _meta_end_dot_

 i spent more than two decades wearing a uniform _meta_end_dot_

 that is exactly what it is stan goff _meta_number_ref_ i hear about tony snow and say to myself well stand up every day lie to the american people at the behest of your dictator esque boss and well how could a cancer not grow in you _meta_end_dot_

 work for fox news spinning the truth in to a billion knots and how can your gut not rot _meta_end_question_

 i know it s terrible _meta_end_dot_

 i admit it _meta_end_dot_

 i don t wish anyone harm even tony snow _meta_end_dot_

 and i do hope he recovers or at least does what he feels is best and surrounds himself with friends and family for his journey _meta_end_dot_

 but in the back of my head there s justin timberlake s what goes around goes around comes around comes all the way back around ya charles karel bouley _meta_number_ref_ general pace you have the power to fulfill your responsibility to protect the troops under your command _meta_end_dot_

 indeed you have an obligation to do so _meta_end_dot_

 you can relieve the president of his command _meta_end_dot_

 not of his presidency _meta_end_dot_

 but of his military role as commander in chief to be crystal clear i am not advocating or inciting you to undertake any illegal act insurrection mutiny putsch or military coup _meta_end_dot_

 in addition to relieving him of his command as commander in chief you also have authority to place the president under military arrest martin lewis
