  it has been a while since i ve read les giblin s very short classic on people skills skill with people and this time around i decided to post a few of the best quotes from the book to rwn _meta_end_dot_

 enjoy _meta_end_exclamation_

 people are primarily interested in themselves not you _meta_end_dot_

 putting this same thought another way the other person is ten thousand times more interested in himself than he is you p _meta_number_ref_ so would you be skillful in human relations be sure to make people feel important _meta_end_dot_

 remember that the more important you make people feel the more they will respond to you p _meta_number_ref_ as long as you live never forget that any fool can disagree with people and that it takes a wise man a shrewd man a big man to agree particularly when the other person is wrong p _meta_number_ref_ the more listening you do the smarter you will become the better you will be liked and the better conversationalist you will be _meta_end_dot_

 a good listener always winds up far ahead of a good talker in the affections of people _meta_end_dot_

 this is because a good listener always allows people to hear their favorite speakers themselves p _meta_number_ref_ then you can move them by telling them what they want to hear _meta_end_dot_

 you simply show them how they can get what they want by doing what you want them to do p _meta_number_ref_ be generous with your praise _meta_end_dot_

 look for somebody and something to praise and then do it _meta_end_dot_

 but the praise must be sincere _meta_end_dot_

 praise the act not the person p _meta_number_ref_ preface criticism with a kind word or compliment make the criticism impersonal criticise the act not the person one criticism to an offense p _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ if you are grateful to people if you let those people know you are grateful almost always they will give you more the next time _meta_end_dot_

 if you don t show your gratitude even if you are grateful chances are that there won t be a next time or that you will end up with less p _meta_number_ref_ be proud of yourself but not conceited of who you are of what you do of where you work _meta_end_dot_

 don t apologize for your station in life or for yourself _meta_end_dot_

 you are what you are so handle yourself with pride and respect p _meta_number_ref_ people have a strong tendency to balk at any action which they feel you are red hot for them doing _meta_end_dot_

 their instinct will be to get suspicious or to drive a harder bargain p _meta_number_ref_
