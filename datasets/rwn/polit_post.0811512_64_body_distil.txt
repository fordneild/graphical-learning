  the democratic party has two weakened candidates _meta_end_dot_

 mrs _meta_end_dot_

 clinton started as a deeply flawed candidate the palpable and unpleasant sense of entitlement the absence of a clear and optimistic message the grating personality impatient to be done with the little people and overly eager for a return to power real power the phoniness and the exaggerations _meta_end_dot_

 these problems have not diminished over the long months of the contest _meta_end_dot_

 they have grown _meta_end_dot_

 she started out with the highest negatives of any major candidate in an open race for the presidency and things have only gotten worse _meta_end_dot_

 and what of the reborn adlai stevenson _meta_end_question_

 mr _meta_end_dot_

 obama is befuddled and angry about the national reaction to what are clearly accepted even commonplace truths in san francisco and hyde park _meta_end_dot_

 how could anyone take offense at the observation that people in small town and rural american are bitter and therefore cling to their guns and their faith as well as their xenophobia _meta_end_question_

 why would anyone raise questions about a public figure who for only _meta_number_ref_ years attended a church and developed a close personal relationship with its preacher who says aids was created by our government as a genocidal tool to be used against people of color who declared america s chickens came home to roost on _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ and wants god to damn america _meta_end_question_

 mr _meta_end_dot_

 obama has a weakness among blue collar working class voters for a reason _meta_end_dot_

 his inspiring rhetoric is a potent tool for energizing college students and previously uninvolved african american voters _meta_end_dot_

 but his appeals are based on two aspirational pledges he is increasingly less credible in making _meta_end_dot_

 mr _meta_end_dot_

 obama s call for postpartisanship looks unconvincing when he is unable to point to a single important instance in his senate career when he demonstrated bipartisanship _meta_end_dot_

 and his repeated calls to remember dr _meta_end_dot_

 martin luther king s fierce urgency of now in tackling big issues falls flat as voters discover that he has not provided leadership on any major legislative battle _meta_end_dot_

 mr _meta_end_dot_

 obama has not been a leader on big causes in congress _meta_end_dot_

 he has been manifestly unwilling to expend his political capital on urgent issues _meta_end_dot_

 he has been only an observer watching the action from a distance thinking wry and sardonic and cynical thoughts to himself about his colleagues mildly amused at their too ing and fro ing _meta_end_dot_

 he has held his energy and talent in reserve for the more important task of advancing his own political career which means running for president _meta_end_dot_

 but something happened along the way _meta_end_dot_

 voters saw in the philadelphia debate the responses of a vitamin deficient stevenson act a like _meta_end_dot_

 and in the closing days of the pennsylvania primary they saw him alternate between whining about his treatment by mrs _meta_end_dot_

 clinton and the press and attacking sen _meta_end_dot_

 john mccain by exaggerating and twisting his words _meta_end_dot_

 no one likes a whiner and his old style attacks undermine his appeals for postpartisanship karl rove
