  everybody is talking about this poll from cnn declaring victory for obama s debate performance last night with an article titled round _meta_number_ref_ in debates goes to obama poll says noah pollak reads the fine print of the article and takes a few notes from deeper down into the specifics _meta_end_dot_

 buried way way down at the bottom of the story hopefully one surmises past the point where anyone would read is the following the results may be favoring obama simply because more democrats than republicans tuned in to the debate _meta_end_dot_

 of the debate watchers questioned in this poll _meta_number_ref_ percent of the respondents identified themselves as democrats _meta_number_ref_ percent as republicans and _meta_number_ref_ percent as independents _meta_end_dot_

 i m far from being a polling expert but this is obviously a slanted poll _meta_end_dot_

 a _meta_number_ref_ point split between republican and democrat respondents _meta_end_question_

 and what percentage of those independents were leaners for obama _meta_end_question_

 that s bad enough but the really egregious part is cnn s blatant reportage of opinion as fact which allowed the creation of a news story announcing obama s victory _meta_end_dot_

 so much for that poll _meta_end_dot_

 the truth is that obama had many many gaffes _meta_end_dot_
