  the day before yesterday more than a few blogs linked to my top _meta_number_ref_ reasons bloggers don t succeed post _meta_end_dot_

 since i encouraged bloggers to link out to other blogs in the article i thought i should prove that piece of advice works by linking back to the ones that did _meta_end_dot_

 i did that yesterday and didn t plan to do it again but there were a good number of blogs that did it again today _meta_end_dot_

 so i decided to link them up again _meta_end_dot_

 check out a few of these blogs _meta_end_dot_
