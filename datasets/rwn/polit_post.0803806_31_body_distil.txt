  remember the obama girl _meta_end_question_

 the girl who was sooo devoted to obama that she made a video that caught the attention of people everywhere _meta_end_question_

 yeah she didn t vote _meta_end_dot_

 excuse _meta_end_question_

 she was sick _meta_end_dot_

 however she wasn t too sick to go to a party on tuesday night city room ran into ms _meta_end_dot_

 ettinger at an election watching party in greenwich village and asked how things went at the polls _meta_end_dot_

 i didn t get a chance to vote today because i m not registered to vote in new york she said _meta_end_dot_

 new jersey um but didn t new jersey also hold a primary _meta_end_question_

 true _meta_end_dot_

 the problem she explained was that she was sick in new york city and was unable to get back across the hudson river to the polls in jersey city _meta_end_dot_

 i was in arizona for the super bowl every time i get in the airplane i get sick said ms _meta_end_dot_

 ettinger who did manage to make it to the svedka fembot election returns party at chinatown brasserie at lafayette and great jones streets _meta_end_dot_

 the fembot campaign for the white house the svedka marketing manager assured us is not a commentary in any way on hillary rodham clinton who defeated mr _meta_end_dot_

 obama in both new york and new jersey ms _meta_end_dot_

 ettinger said she had dragged herself out tuesday night under duress only because she was scheduled to perform at the bowery poetry club _meta_end_dot_

 the previous day she had hit the streets of new york to interview voters where a daily news photographer snapped her picture on park avenue _meta_end_dot_

 and how did she feel about missing the opportunity to cast her ballot for her one and only _meta_end_question_

 i m a little upset but i really couldn t help it today she said mournfully _meta_end_dot_

 i ve told this story over at my own blog several times but since most of you have never even heard of me or my blog i ll tell it again _meta_end_dot_

 back in _meta_number_ref_ when john i served in vietnam kerry was running against bush and immediately in the wake of michael moore s crockumentary several young people who worked with me i was a restaurant manager at the time were so fired up that they were going to make sure to vote _meta_end_dot_

 come hell or high water they were going to make a point to set their alarm clocks for something other than noon leave their dorms and go to the polls _meta_end_dot_

 it was a done deal they swore to me _meta_end_dot_

 what happened _meta_end_question_

 yup you guessed it they never made it _meta_end_dot_

 i don t remember the exact reason but it was basically an i forgot type of thing _meta_end_dot_

 now as i said i was in restaurant management and had been for nearly twenty years _meta_end_dot_

 i ve seen this same scenario played out each and every election and when these little hippie wannabees said they were going to go vote i just chuckled and said yeah right because i knew they wouldn t go and that they d have some creative excuses for not doing so _meta_end_dot_

 i ll give props to the obama girl _meta_end_dot_

 being too sick to vote is a new one to me but the results are the same you trust the youth in america to put you over the top at your own peril _meta_end_dot_

 they will not turn out for any politician no matter how fired up they are and no matter what they are promised _meta_end_dot_

 brian runs the blog liberty pundit _meta_end_dot_

 drop in and say hi _meta_end_dot_
