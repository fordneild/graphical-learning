  one of the reasons that many people have such an intense distrust of polling data is the little games that the mainstream media plays with them _meta_end_dot_

 for example take the latest poll from cbs which is titled cbs poll support for obama rebounds _meta_end_dot_

 in wake of controversy over former pastor illinois senator builds lead over mccain clinton here are the nuts and bolts of what the poll shows on one key measure obama has seen a big reversal since his denunciation of wright s remarks on tuesday _meta_end_dot_

 he now leads presumptive republican nominee john mccain in the hypothetical fall contest by eleven points _meta_number_ref_ percent to _meta_number_ref_ percent _meta_end_dot_

 that compares to a tied match up in a cbs news new york times poll that was released last wednesday _meta_end_dot_

 positive assessments of how obama has handled the situation with wright are also reflected by a continued lead over fellow democrat hillary clinton in his battle for their party s nomination _meta_end_dot_

 among democratic primary voters those who have voted or plan to vote in a democratic primary obama s lead over clinton has increased he now leads clinton by twelve points _meta_number_ref_ percent to _meta_number_ref_ percent _meta_end_dot_

 that s up from his eight point lead in the poll released just a few days ago _meta_end_dot_

 so obama is dominating destroying both mccain and hillary right _meta_end_question_

 that s certainly what the article is saying and the story is being seen all over the place _meta_end_dot_

 it s even at the top of the drudge report _meta_end_dot_

 does that mean the race is over and obama has it in the bag _meta_end_question_

 ehr not so fast _meta_end_dot_

 let s go over to real clear politics and compare the numbers from the nyt cbs poll to some other polling numbers _meta_end_dot_

 first off the cbs news ny times ran from _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ to _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 gallup has a poll that ran from _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ and rasmussen has one that ran from _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ to _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 both rasmussen and gallup have significantly larger sample sizes and personally i d say both of them have proven to be better more reliable pollsters than the cbs news ny times combo _meta_end_dot_

 so how do the numbers break down _meta_end_question_

 in an obama vs _meta_end_dot_

 mccain match up cbs news ny times obama _meta_number_ref_ rasmussen mccain _meta_number_ref_ what about in an obama vs _meta_end_dot_

 hillary match up _meta_end_question_

 cbs news ny times obama _meta_number_ref_ rasmussen tie so what does that mean _meta_end_question_

 well it s possible that the cbs news ny times is the first poll to catch on to a trend but it s more likely that the poll is just an outlier that s just plain old wrong _meta_end_dot_

 that does happen _meta_end_dot_

 well if that s the case then why did the mainstream media latch on to this poll _meta_end_question_

 the msm tends to like polls that show results that are very different than what the perceived political situation is because those polls draw eyeballs _meta_end_dot_

 moreover the msm really loves polls of the sort that confirm their pre existing biases _meta_end_dot_

 since they adore obama want him to win and want hillary to quit this poll is right down their alley and was guaranteed to get huge play _meta_end_dot_

 the msm does this all the time and it s a big part of the reason why people don t have a lot of trust in polls or for that matter the mainstream media _meta_end_dot_
