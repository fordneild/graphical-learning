  you would think liberals would get bored looking for coded racism _meta_end_dot_

 since they can find it absolutely anywhere it must be like shooting fish in a barrel _meta_end_dot_

 but then so is making fun of moonbats like timothy noah who declares that it s racist to notice how scrawny obama is _meta_end_dot_

 noah denounces a wsj piece proposing that obama s skinniness could be a liability _meta_end_dot_

 his keen insight has discerned that by skinniness they really meant mulatto ness _meta_end_dot_

 a ny discussion of obama s skinniness and its impact on the typical american voter can t avoid being interpreted as a coded discussion of race _meta_end_dot_

 in the interests of full disclosure noah hilariously admits i phoned my former journal colleague michel martin an african american journalist who is now host of npr s tell me more which frequently addresses matters of race to ask whether she was offended _meta_end_dot_

 she was not _meta_end_dot_

 apparently not even blacks who make a living off taxpayer financed moonbattery can compete with noah when it comes to sniffing out imaginary racism _meta_end_dot_

 he explains his theory when white people are invited to think about obama s physical appearance the principal attribute they re likely to dwell on is his dark skin _meta_end_dot_

 consequently any reference to obama s other physical attributes can t help coming off as a coy walk around the barn _meta_end_dot_

 in other words noticing anything whatsoever about obama is racist _meta_end_dot_

 the obamessiah is so sacred that even naming his characteristics is blasphemous _meta_end_dot_

 we ve also heard that mentioning his middle name is racist _meta_end_dot_

 but his last name also recalls an mortal enemy of america who tellingly is not an anglo saxon _meta_end_dot_

 it might be safest to refer to obama from now on as he who cannot be named or described but only abjectly venerated _meta_end_dot_
