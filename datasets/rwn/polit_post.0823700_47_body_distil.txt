  something very peculiar is happening at the ap so much so that i think someone might be sneaking something into the ap water supply _meta_end_dot_

 why do i say this _meta_end_question_

 because of the almost bizarrely objective series of articles the ap published on the occasion of obama s announcement that joe biden was going to be the next president er vice president of the united states _meta_end_dot_

 i expected to see the same slavish enthusiasm that the rest of the msm is already displaying _meta_end_dot_

 instead i discovered this analysis biden pick shows lack of confidence in picking sen _meta_end_dot_

 joe biden to be his running mate barack obama sought to shore up his weakness inexperience in office and on foreign policy rather than underscore his strength as a new generation candidate defying political conventions _meta_end_dot_

 snip the picks say something profound about obama for all his self confidence the _meta_number_ref_ year old illinois senator worried that he couldn t beat republican john mccain without help from a seasoned politician willing to attack _meta_end_dot_

 wow _meta_end_exclamation_

 according to this ap analysis biden isn t some sort of magical golden boy _meta_end_dot_

 instead he s a much needed life preserver for a foundering candidate _meta_end_dot_

 i might have thought the above analysis was simply an anomaly with ron fournier breaking from the ap lockstep if it weren t for the fact that i immediately came across two more ap articles both by calvin woodward and both of which damn biden with faint praise _meta_end_dot_

 or maybe they praise him with faint damns it s not always clear the first is entitled biden speaks and speaks his own mind which is a polite way of saying the man bloviates _meta_end_dot_

 although the article praises his foreign policy experience which is of value only if one agrees with his foreign policy goals it s also chock full of direct and indirect insults regarding his judgment and his logorrhea _meta_end_dot_

 for example how about this very un ap ish slap at biden for voting for the iraq war when it was popular changing his mind when it was unpopular and now clinging to that last position despite the change in facts on the ground emphasis mine _meta_end_question_

 biden voted in _meta_number_ref_ to authorize the iraq invasion which obama opposed from the start _meta_end_dot_

 since then he s become a firm critic of the conflict and pushed through a resolution last year declaring that bush s troop increase now considered a military success was not in the national interest the article also doesn t hesitate to cover his little plagiarism problem although it doesn t refer to his law school plagiarism just to his _meta_number_ref_ decision to steal a speech from a leftist british politician as well as some of his more famous gaffes _meta_end_dot_

 thus readers get reminded both that he once bizarrely referred to his current running mate as an articulate and clean man and that he suggested that _meta_number_ref_ eleven and dunkin donuts customers cultivate east indian accents _meta_end_dot_

 in other words the article is surprisingly honest _meta_end_dot_

 calvin woodward strikes again with an article bearing the not so flattering title biden brings agile mind loose lips to ticket after a flattering first two paragraphs about biden s bonhomous charm woodward throws this punch about biden s presence on the ticket he adds suspense too over the question of when not if he ll put his foot in his mouth _meta_end_dot_

 biden s agile mind comes with a loose tongue that cannot always be properly restrained _meta_end_dot_

 there follows some complimentary talk about biden s long career having eventually created depth where there was formerly only steak free sizzle _meta_end_dot_

 abandoning that line of talk though woodward again harks back to that little plagiarism problem and then throws in biden s now famous insult to a potential voter i have a much higher iq than you do i suspect the article then zig zags back to biden s personal history including the tragic car accident that claimed his first wife and his daughter as well as severely injuring his sons but closes on a sour note by reminding readers about biden s clean and articulate reference to obama and his nasty remark about east indian entrepreneurs _meta_end_dot_

 perhaps i m reading undue significance into woodward s narrative choice for the article s conclusion but the fact is that as every lawyer knows you put your strongest point at the front and either reiterate it at the end or you close with your second strongest point _meta_end_dot_

 that an ap writer chose to close his column by reminding his readers about biden s problems with race is either really stupid or really significant _meta_end_dot_

 the last ap article that crossed my radar in the hours since biden s nomination is one that announces that biden s career provides for mccain s mill _meta_end_dot_

 this article is worth reading in its entirety because it s just a beautiful laundry list of the myriad problems that have plagued biden _meta_end_dot_

 the ap s writers do make the point that any career politician is going to have a huge list of problems so that this article may be an attempt at damage control better to defuse the issue of his failings by putting them out up front as opposed to playing obama s hide and go seek the corruption game _meta_end_dot_

 even though this full frontal honesty may have some virtue i can t help but think that constantly repeating biden s moral failings because plagiarism is theft and his idiotic statements is not going to comfort readers especially given that these same failings jettisoned his two previous runs for the presidency _meta_end_dot_

 the ap s bizarre lapse into honesty shows what happens when the media creates a candidate and then is stuck with the candidate s conduct _meta_end_dot_

 unless a liberal media outlet wishes to turn into a perfect _meta_number_ref_ outlet that creates an alternative reality unbounded by actual facts it s going to have to confront unpleasant truths and then spin them as best it can _meta_end_dot_

 and i can tell you that the spinning on the biden watch is going to be dizzying _meta_end_dot_
