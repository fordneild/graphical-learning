  two schoolboys in britain were punished for refusing to kneel and pray to allah _meta_end_dot_

 two schoolboys were given detention after refusing to kneel down and pray to allah during a religious education lesson _meta_end_dot_

 parents were outraged that the two boys from year seven _meta_number_ref_ to _meta_number_ref_ year olds were punished for not wanting to take part in the practical demonstration of how allah is worshipped _meta_end_dot_

 they said forcing their children to take part in the exercise at alsager high school near stoke on trent which included wearing muslim headgear was a breach of their human rights _meta_end_dot_

 one parent sharon luinen said this isn t right it s taking things too far _meta_end_dot_

 i understand that they have to learn about other religions _meta_end_dot_

 i can live with that but it is taking it a step too far to be punished because they wouldn t join in muslim prayer _meta_end_dot_

 it s amazing the amount of trouble that is being perpetrated in the name of diversity what s even more amazing is the bravery and clear headedness of these two schoolboys who understood that there are some things important enough to require defying authority _meta_end_dot_

 would your kids do the same if they were asked to pray to someone else s god _meta_end_question_

 what would you do under a greater threat _meta_end_question_
