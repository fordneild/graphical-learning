  how feasible is it that wind power is really going to go from meeting far less than _meta_percent_ref_ of our current energy needs to _meta_percent_ref_ of our energy needs which would presumably allow pickens to make back the billions he put into wind power and collect a tidy profit for his trouble _meta_end_question_

 well take a look at these numbers and you tell me how likely wind power is to sweep the nation in the next few years how many windmills does it take to meet the power needs of a typical city much less new york city _meta_end_question_

 at www scitizen com kurt cobb worked the numbers _meta_end_dot_

 generously he presumed the windmills would use _meta_number_ref_ megawatt turbines generating three times the output of a typical _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ megawatt turbine _meta_end_dot_

 he compared that with a _meta_number_ref_ megawatt fossil fuel coal power plant needed to power a city of _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ people _meta_end_dot_

 a typical power plant he noted would cover _meta_number_ref_ acres but use only _meta_number_ref_ of those for the actual facility _meta_end_dot_

 cobb calculated it would take _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ megawatt wind turbines to equal the coal plant s output since the wind doesn t blow constantly _meta_end_dot_

 each would need to be spaced _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ feet away from the others five times the diameter of their _meta_number_ref_ foot rotors _meta_end_dot_

 adding the rotor diameters to the spacing requirement equates to a _meta_number_ref_ mile long line of windmills half a mile in width _meta_end_dot_

 it comes to _meta_number_ref_ square miles _meta_end_dot_

 that s to provide electricity for a town of _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ people _meta_end_dot_

 new york city has _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ million residents _meta_end_dot_

 manhattan island totals _meta_number_ref_ square miles _meta_end_dot_

 so based on cobb s calculations it would take six and a half manhattan islands each covered totally with windmills to power one tenth of new york city _meta_end_dot_

 and if standard _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ megawatt wind turbines were used they would take three times more space _meta_end_dot_

 going back to kurt cobb s calculations if we wanted to meet the electric needs of _meta_number_ref_ million americans rather than only _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ we d need a half mile swath of windmills each of them hundreds of feet high _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ miles long crisscrossing the continent _meta_number_ref_ times between new york city and los angeles _meta_end_dot_

 that s a lot of land to condemn _meta_end_dot_

 the cost would be in the hundreds of billions of dollars since each large windmill costs millions the left has been blocking drilling of _meta_number_ref_ acres of land in anwr but they re going to allow us to build enormous ugly noisy bird killing windmills everywhere you look all across the country _meta_end_question_

 c mon how can anyone believe that _meta_end_question_

 windmills are expensive inefficient take up an inordinate amount of space and would be seldom built anywhere in the united states if there was no hope of getting the government to subsidize their construction and maintenance _meta_end_dot_

 if the politicians in dc would face up to those facts instead of throwing away more taxpayer money on these windmill boondoggles just so that they can run commercials at election time bragging that they re green the whole country would be better off _meta_end_dot_
