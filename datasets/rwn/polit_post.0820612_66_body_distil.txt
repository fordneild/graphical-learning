  everywhere you look these days you see billionaire oil magnate t _meta_end_dot_

 boone pickens promoting wind power as the answer to america s energy problems _meta_end_dot_

 for example here s a story that ran yesterday in the san antonio business journal texas oilman t _meta_end_dot_

 boone pickens told lawmakers that a switch to american produced energy resources within the next _meta_number_ref_ years is necessary to end the nation s crippling _meta_dollor_ref_ billion dependence on foreign oil _meta_end_dot_

 pickens who revealed his alternative energy plan earlier this month told the u s _meta_end_dot_

 senate homeland and security and government affairs committee on tuesday that the united states should be able to produce _meta_number_ref_ percent of its electrical energy needs using wind powered electricity based on department of energy estimates _meta_end_dot_

 pickens points to the great plains which includes parts of west texas as a prime location for producing wind energy resources _meta_end_dot_

 pickens plan calls for lawmakers to reduce america s dependence on foreign oil by _meta_number_ref_ percent in _meta_number_ref_ years _meta_end_dot_

 it also stipulates that the country needs to rely _meta_number_ref_ percent on energy resources produced in the united states _meta_end_dot_

 at first glance this would seem to be a curious plan because wind power produces a tiny percentage of our current energy supply takes up an enormous amount of space and there is very little evidence that it s truly a promising long term energy source for our country wind power is intermittent _meta_end_dot_

 it is simply not available on those hot humid dog days of summer when energy demand peaks _meta_end_dot_

 the same is true for those quiet read windless bone chilling days and nights of winter _meta_end_dot_

 to produce the same amount of energy as a conventional gas fired power plant wind farms need _meta_number_ref_ times more land area _meta_end_dot_

 while environmental activist groups regularly fight against a lone cell phone tower on a hill wind tower sprawl casts far more sight pollution upon pristine vistas _meta_end_dot_

 most folks are not amused by the blinding strobe light sensation that takes place on wind farms at dawn and dusk or the near constant noise pollution which many people find maddening _meta_end_dot_

 to its credit wind power is far more economical than solar it is only twice as costly as electricity generated from fossil fuels _meta_end_dot_

 perhaps the most troubling aspect of wind power from an environmental perspective is its devastating effect on bird populations particularly birds of prey _meta_end_dot_

 in _meta_number_ref_ there were over _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ wind turbines in northern california s altamont pass _meta_end_dot_

 that figure has since dropped to _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 many of the earlier projects failed because they were not financially viable without substantial tax incentives and direct subsidies from taxpayers and ratepayers _meta_end_dot_

 moreover altamont pass is america s raptor killing field as many as _meta_number_ref_ golden eagles red tailed hawks burrowing owls and kestrels are killed every year by the wind turbines at altamont pass _meta_end_dot_

 the department of energy s wind energy initiative calls for obtaining _meta_number_ref_ percent of our nation s electricity from wind turbines by the year _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 to meet that goal will require the planting of more than _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ new wind turbines a figure three times greater than the number of existing communication towers in the u s _meta_end_dot_

 so why is t _meta_end_dot_

 boone pickens pushing wind so hard _meta_end_question_

 might i suggest that it s because he has invested a great deal of money into wind power and wants government help getting his money back out of it _meta_end_question_

 from the wall street journal in sept of last year another major venture in the works for t _meta_end_dot_

 boone pickens is a _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ megawatt wind farm to be built in texas by mesa power in a plan unveiled earlier this year _meta_end_dot_

 it would be the world s largest upon completion with a cost of up to _meta_dollor_ref_ billion the real pickens plan probably has a lot more to do with convincing people that billions of tax dollars need to be transferred into t _meta_end_dot_

 boone pickens pockets than it does with meeting america s energy needs _meta_end_dot_
