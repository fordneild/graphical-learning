  with fred thompson leaving the race a lot of people are wondering whom his supporters will gravitate towards _meta_end_dot_

 first off i ve seen a couple of online polls here here that indicate fred s supporters will break heavily towards mitt romney at _meta_percent_ref_ plus clip _meta_end_dot_

 on the other hand when i polled bloggers on this topic they seemed to split more evenly amongst the candidates with mitt and rudy benefitting the most _meta_number_ref_ which candidate would you like to see as the republican party s nominee out of this group _meta_end_question_

 a rudy giuliani _meta_number_ref_ _meta_percent_ref_ c john mccain _meta_number_ref_ _meta_percent_ref_ e fred thompson _meta_number_ref_ _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ which candidate would you like to see as the republican party s nominee out of this group _meta_end_question_

 a rudy giuliani _meta_number_ref_ _meta_percent_ref_ c john mccain _meta_number_ref_ _meta_percent_ref_ my instinct is that poll is probably a little more representative of how things would work in the real world _meta_end_dot_

 fred thompson s supporters would probably break down like so a significant group of them go for the most conservative remaining candidate in the race mitt romney _meta_end_dot_

 another group of them would probably go for rudy giuliani the moderate candidate who has been beaten up the least over the last month _meta_end_dot_

 then a smaller group would probably gravitate towards mike huckabee as much as anything because he s the only remaining southerner _meta_end_dot_

 last but not least another small group would probably move towards the front runner john mccain _meta_end_dot_
