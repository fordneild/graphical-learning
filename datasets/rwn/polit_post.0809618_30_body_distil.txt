  crossposted from staclu the government has raised the number of detainees at gitmo that they will be seeking the death penalty for to the enormous and shocking number of seven _meta_end_dot_

 the aclu are quick and ready to defend these warriors _meta_end_exclamation_

 backed by a slate of prominent legal figures including former attorney general janet reno and former federal bureau of investigation director william webster the aclu has assembled a team of top civilian attorneys to supplement the military defense counsel assigned to represent guantanamo s high value detainees the effort significantly adds to the legal forces that over the past seven years have challenged the administration s plan to run an offshore court that provides defendants fewer rights than civilian trials or courts martial _meta_end_dot_

 the addition of the aclu in particular with its large financial resources is a major shot in the arm for those who oppose the tribunal system _meta_end_dot_

 exciting stuff _meta_end_exclamation_

 the shot in the arm talk from the aclu is probably an example of their less than sensitive side _meta_end_dot_

 its witty though i ll give em that _meta_end_dot_

 see dubya pretty much covers this as good as it gets _meta_end_dot_

 i m hoping that the reason they call these murdering creeps high value because it is a high value that we make sure they are dead _meta_end_dot_

 it is also wonderful that janet reno of waco and elian gonzales fame will be on the defense team _meta_end_dot_

 i think its just cozy how the aclu defends the very idiots that want to destroy freedom _meta_end_dot_

 isn t that keen _meta_end_question_

 i mean any organization claiming to defend freedom and liberty should be defending the very people trying to destroy it _meta_end_dot_

 right _meta_end_question_

 i mean that makes sense _meta_end_dot_

 doesn t it _meta_end_question_

 clue in it isn t freedom the aclu defends it is absolutism pssssstttt its called absolutism _meta_end_exclamation_

 its been the sabotage of many civilizations _meta_end_dot_

 the barnyard asks wasn t ramsey clark also bill clinton s ag at one point he who joined saddam a defense team _meta_end_question_

 it is pretty clear at this point which side the democrats and their base are on and it ain t america s _meta_end_dot_
