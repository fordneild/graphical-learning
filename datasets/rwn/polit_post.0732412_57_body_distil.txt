  good morning rwn philes _meta_end_dot_

 my name is jimmie bise jr and i blog at the sundries shack _meta_end_dot_

 i m pleased to be one of john s guest bloggers today _meta_end_dot_

 i think him for the chance to introduce myself to you all and to point you over to my blog which has plenty of room for new visitors hint hint _meta_end_dot_

 i m in an exceptionally good mood this morning after sleeping on this story from diwaniyah iraq _meta_end_dot_

 i hope you find it as refreshing as i did _meta_end_dot_

 mookie al sadr and his merry band of thugs are at the wrong end of the gun this time and it s about darned time _meta_end_dot_

 i m one of those crazed wingnuts who believe that one of the president s greatest mistakes in iraq was letting this guy off the hook years ago _meta_end_dot_

 in my warmongering opinion he s been living on borrowed time and unless he continues to hide under his masters robes in iran it s only a matter of time before he s behind bars to pushing up daisies _meta_end_dot_

 here s a bit from the story that s especially encouraging they have been dismissed for supporting armed gangs he said _meta_end_dot_

 as i said when i wrote about this last night if the police force in dwianiyah is purging itself of the bad eggs it s not going to be long before we see it happening in other cities _meta_end_dot_

 that will be the beginning of the end for the sectarian agitators and iranian operatives _meta_end_dot_
