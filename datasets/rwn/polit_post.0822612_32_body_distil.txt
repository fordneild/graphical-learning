  y ou may have noticed recently that oil prices have gone down _meta_end_dot_

 as you might imagine there s no magic involved no conspiracies and nothing particularly profound which has caused this to happen _meta_end_dot_

 in fact it is a result of more supply than demand at this moment because use on a world wide basis has temporarily fallen _meta_end_dot_

 global oil demand for this year is expected to stand at _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ million barrels a day unchanged from the previous month s forecasts the iea said in an august monthly report _meta_end_dot_

 oil supplies on the other hand are expected to remain strong _meta_end_dot_

 the world produced _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ million barrels of oil in july up _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ barrels from the previous month the iea said _meta_end_dot_

 the slowdown in demand related to the general economic downturn and high oil prices is becoming increasingly evident the iea said in the report _meta_end_dot_

 consumers clearly are reacting by a change in driving behavior i seem to remember for instance that americans cut their driving mileage by _meta_number_ref_ billion miles one month _meta_end_dot_

 that has been one reason among many that supply has temporarily outstripped demand by about about a million barrels a day _meta_end_dot_

 it is also a reason other than the obvious one that tapping the strategic petroleum reserve will have little or no effect on pricing at the pump and certainly no lasting effect _meta_end_dot_

 it also makes the case that speculation isn t driving pricing crude was trading at a _meta_dollor_ref_ a barrel this week _meta_end_dot_

 so two of the democrats primary solutions beside inflating your tires properly of course to the gas price crisis are really non starters _meta_end_dot_

 however there s always a however such a condition higher supply than demand is a temporary one _meta_end_dot_

 and while demand in developed countries seems to be falling or at least remaining steady it is expected that developing countries will continue to increase their demand for oil _meta_end_dot_

 the iea s estimate for non oecd countries is about _meta_number_ref_ _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 so what does that mean for usage _meta_end_question_

 although the iea didn t change this year s outlook for oil demand it said consumption in the next year will increase to _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ million barrels up _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ barrels from the previous month s forecast _meta_end_dot_

 that is exactly what it estimates the world is producing right now _meta_end_dot_

 so _meta_end_question_

 so expect prices to go back up a bit _meta_end_dot_

 and expect that if everything remains peaceful and there are no disruptions in production _meta_end_dot_

 and we all know that s going to happen right _meta_end_question_

 demand in developing countries is still strong geopolitical tensions in nigeria and other countries could still disrupt supplies and hurricanes bertha and dolly although did little damage to oil facilities in the gulf of mexico flagged a vigorous start to what could be an active autumn storm season the point _meta_end_question_

 well two points really _meta_end_dot_

 as mentioned the democratic solutions would have no effect on pricing as is obvious _meta_end_dot_

 secondly though prices are going to go back up when demand resumes its rise _meta_end_dot_

 usa today points out that demand for smaller cars has already fallen off as gas prices have dropped this past month _meta_end_dot_

 apparently _meta_dollor_ref_ a gal _meta_end_dot_

 is the pain threshold for most americans and below that they seem less concerned with gas prices _meta_end_dot_

 what does that mean politically then _meta_end_question_

 with this current drop in oil prices look for a couple of things in the coming months _meta_end_dot_

 one look for democrats to try to run a bluff and claim credit for the price decrease due to their threat to tap the spr and regulate speculation a bit like obama s claim that democrats being elected in _meta_number_ref_ is what turned iraq around _meta_end_dot_

 i d expect them to paint this temporary dip in demand as a more permanent one which would preclude any need to drill on an extensive basis _meta_end_dot_

 two i d be willing to bet that congress will authorize some very limited drilling in some areas offshore to appease those who want to see more drilling and protect dems in districts demanding it but extend the ban on most drilling when september _meta_number_ref_th rolls around citing the drop in price as the reason _meta_end_dot_

 three look for prices to increase again on or about the november election as the world catches its collective breath and we see demand again surge _meta_end_dot_

 and finally four come january we will be in exactly the same situation we are now with even less hope that extensive drilling will become a reality _meta_end_dot_

 all speculation on my part a type of speculation that congress thankfully can t regulate yet _meta_end_dot_

 but having watched the maneuvering by pelosi reid and company these last few months it is a very plausible scenario _meta_end_dot_

 if it plays out that way our energy deficit will continue to mount prices will continue the rise and we may reach the point barring some energy miracle where a certain segment of the consumer market can no longer afford the cost of energy _meta_end_dot_

 but dems will have won the political battle won t they _meta_end_question_

 that s something _meta_end_dot_
