  so i arrived in austin texas yesterday for the american dream summit _meta_end_dot_

 it was a long strange trip _meta_end_dot_

 i ve never been a big flyer and believe it or not this was my first post _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ plane flight _meta_end_dot_

 it encompassed three flights _meta_end_dot_

 one from the myrtle beach airport to charlotte _meta_end_dot_

 the _meta_number_ref_nd from charlotte to houston and the last from houston to austin _meta_end_dot_

 the first two legs of the flight were with american airlines which i am happy to say exceeded my very low expectations _meta_end_dot_

 the planes left on time everyone was friendly and competent and generally they made things as pleasant as possible _meta_end_dot_

 continental on the other hand handled the last leg of my flight and when i arrived in austin i found that my bag hadn t arrived with me _meta_end_dot_

 nothing like meeting new people for dinner without a brush to use on your hair a chance to brush your teeth again and in the same clothes you wore while you flew across the country but i digress _meta_end_dot_

 the whole airport experience despite being better than i thought it would be in many ways makes me understand why people are so reluctant to fly these days _meta_end_dot_

 there were the two connecting flights a lot of hurry up and wait activity airplane seats that are too small intrusive security searches and of course the lost bag _meta_end_dot_

 also at times the whole experience was a little orwellian _meta_end_dot_

 there are security guards everywhere they re actually screening your shoes they re making announcements about and i didn t catch all of this which made it even more alarming how they may arrest you if you make a joke about being a bomber it s just not a pleasant atmosphere to travel in _meta_end_dot_

 moreover i suspect that my return trip which features hour long stop overs for each connecting flight and is scheduled to take more than _meta_number_ref_ hours total isn t going to turn me around on the whole experience either _meta_end_dot_

 now you may say hawkins come on they have no choice other than to run it exactly that way because of the fear of terrorism and to make money that may be true but it s also not the problem of their customers _meta_end_dot_

 austin would have been too far to drive _meta_number_ref_ hours but i gotta tell you anything _meta_number_ref_ or _meta_number_ref_ hours away by car you d probably be better off driving _meta_end_dot_

 it s cheaper more comfortable no annoying security no walking around strange cavernous airports trying to figure out where the gate for your connecting flight is and as a general rule given how early you have to get to the airport just in case they decide to single you out for special security screening and the stop overs i m not sure that it would be significantly slower to drive for shorter trips _meta_end_dot_

 update _meta_number_ref_ this post was mostly written last night before i went to bed i went out for bbq and drinks with emily zanotti from the american princess sean hackbarth from the american mind and the guys from the sam adams alliance _meta_end_dot_

 my bag did finally arrive while i slept at about _meta_number_ref_ a m _meta_end_dot_

 however for whatever reason the front of the bag was sopping wet when i received it this morning _meta_end_dot_

 thank you continental airlines _meta_end_dot_
