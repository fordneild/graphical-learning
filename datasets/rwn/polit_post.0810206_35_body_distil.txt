  so far because the mainstream media is smitten with him barack obama has been able to get by running a campaign based on hope change unity love and rainbows made of cuddly kittens _meta_end_dot_

 however before we get around to coronating barack as our new president cult of unity leader there are a few questions he should have to answer before america starts drinking his kool aid _meta_end_dot_

 granted many members of our esteemed press seem to consider it crass to expect obama to actually answer questions about unimportant things like his agenda his character and what he actually wants to do when he becomes the leader of the free world _meta_end_dot_

 that s why he would probably get away with doing what slick politicians like him always do when they re asked tough questions lie misdirect and dodge _meta_end_dot_

 but still wouldn t it be great if there were some members of the mainstream media that at least had enough integrity to ask him the tough questions in the first place _meta_end_question_

 ok you can stop laughing now _meta_end_dot_

 let me put it another way if there are any hillary clinton fans in the press who d like to help derail obama so that your preferred liberal candidate can win start putting questions like these to him you ve made unifying the american public and putting our political divisions behind us one of the central themes of your campaign _meta_end_dot_

 yet national journal ranked you as the single most liberal senator in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 so which liberal beliefs of yours are you willing to give up for unity s sake _meta_end_question_

 along the same lines john mccain has been behind numerous pieces of prominent bi partisan legislation _meta_end_dot_

 so if voters are looking for a candidate who can unify the country wouldn t he be a better choice than you _meta_end_question_

 if you didn t agree with jeremiah wright s racist and anti american views why did you take your own children to his church and expose them to what he had to say _meta_end_question_

 if i may steal a question from peter weher with which elements if any of black liberation theology as represented by reverend wright and trinity united church of christ do you strongly disagree _meta_end_question_

 do you think any of the core tenets of black liberation theology are racist could black voters trust a white candidate to fairly represent their interests even if he attended an anti black church and was close friends with a prominent white minister who was famously hostile to black americans _meta_end_question_

 john conyers has said that he intends to move legislation that could lead the federal government to apologize for slavery and pay reparations if you become president _meta_end_dot_

 would you support that legislation _meta_end_question_

 given our budget deficit how can you justify giving away _meta_number_ref_ billion dollars of our tax money to other nations over the next _meta_number_ref_ years via your global poverty act _meta_end_question_

 in _meta_number_ref_ you said that you opposed the defense of marriage act which is designed to keep gay marriage from being imposed on the country by judicial fiat _meta_end_dot_

 do you think the american people and their representatives should have a right to decide whether or not they want gay marriage in their states _meta_end_question_

 if the answer is yes how can you possibly square that with your opposition to the defense of marriage act _meta_end_question_

 given that you re pro partial birth abortion would you support overturning the partial birth abortion ban act of _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_question_

 you claim to support the _meta_number_ref_nd amendment but why should people believe you when in _meta_number_ref_ you supported banning the manufacture sale and possession of handguns many people believe your plan for iraq would be viewed as a huge victory for al qaeda in much of the world would lead to the collapse of democracy in that country would boost iran s standing in the region and would lead to genocide on a massive scale _meta_end_dot_

 do you believe that those things won t happen or do you believe that those are prices we should be willing to pay to leave iraq _meta_end_question_

 you ve often spoken about what the positive effects of pulling out of iraq will be but what do you think the negative consequences of your choice to lose the war in iraq will be _meta_end_question_

 given that we re fighting a war on terror why do you think it s appropriate for you to continue to personally associate with terrorists like william ayers and bernardine dohrn who bombed buildings on american soil attempted to murder army officers and even today publicly say that they have no regrets about their actions _meta_end_question_

 can you give a more convincing explanation for why you no longer wear a flag pin and why you famously chose not to hold your hand over your heart for our national anthem _meta_end_question_

 your campaign has suggested that you should receive half the delegates from the state of michigan even though your name wasn t even on the ballot _meta_end_dot_

 given that your supporters helped thwart a re vote isn t that extraordinarily hypocritical arrogant and undemocratic of you _meta_end_question_

 given your past history of using cocaine which is extremely addictive would you be willing to regularly take drug tests during the campaign and when you re in the white house to insure americans that you re not still using _meta_end_question_

 you claimed that you never saw or approved an illinois voter group s detailed questionnaire that had you taking some embarrassingly liberal stands on gun control the death penalty and abortion you chalked up those answers on the questionnaire to an overzealous aide _meta_end_dot_

 yet it turned out that you were blatantly lying and were actually interviewed for the questionnaire and even sent in your own handwritten notes _meta_end_dot_

 so if you re willing to tell such a bald faced lie to cover up your liberal positions why should the american people believe you now when you claim on issue after issue to have flip flopped to a more moderate position than you held just a few years back _meta_end_question_

 you personally along with your campaign have continuously and consistently lied and claimed that john mccain wants to fight a war in iraq for the next _meta_number_ref_ years _meta_end_dot_

 however what he actually said and has repeated many times is maybe we ll be in iraq for _meta_number_ref_ years we ve been in japan for _meta_number_ref_ years we ve been in south korea for _meta_number_ref_ years that d be fine with me as long as americans are not being injured or harmed or wounded or killed why have you continued to knowingly lie about this issue and why should voters trust what you say if you re going to deliberately try to mislead them in this fashion _meta_end_question_

 after engaging in a crooked land deal with tony rezko a man who donated _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ from an alleged kickback scheme to your campaign how can voters trust you to act in an ethical fashion in the white house _meta_end_question_

 according to an april _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ article from the chicago sun times called barack obama and his slumlord patron do you have any regrets about teaming up with a slumlord to further your own political career on the backs of the very poor people you claimed to be helping _meta_end_question_
