  good news for anyone who doesn t want iraq to degenerate into a terror sponsoring iranian proxy state so that our troops will have fought and died for nothing but what he ll say next is anyone s guess _meta_end_dot_

 here s what it says on his website obama will immediately begin to remove our troops from iraq _meta_end_dot_

 he will remove one to two combat brigades each month and have all of our combat brigades out of iraq within _meta_number_ref_ months _meta_end_dot_

 obama will make it clear that we will not build any permanent bases in iraq _meta_end_dot_

 i wonder is the attack on pakistan still on _meta_end_question_

 or does he need to talk it over with ahmadinejad first _meta_end_question_

 vacillator in chief _meta_end_dot_
