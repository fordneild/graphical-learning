  a black firefighter has admitted to staging a fake hate crime at a fire station in east baltimore _meta_end_dot_

 via the baltimore sun emphasis added a firefighter who reported finding a knotted rope and a threatening note with a drawing of a noose in an east baltimore station house last month had placed the items there himself city officials said yesterday _meta_end_dot_

 the man was suspended last week for performance related issues and will likely face additional punishment fire officials said _meta_end_dot_

 sterling clifford a spokesman for the police department and for mayor sheila dixon said the man admitted to the hoax and will not face criminal charges _meta_end_dot_

 officials identified the firefighter who they say acknowledged writing the note as donald maynard a firefighter paramedic apprentice who is black _meta_end_dot_

 maynard could not be reached for comment _meta_end_dot_

 the rope incident sparked outrage two weeks ago and prompted a federal investigation into possible civil rights violations _meta_end_dot_

 it was the latest in a series of incidents that have cast the fire department in a poor light over the past year including the death of a recruit in a training exercise and accusations of racism _meta_end_dot_

 the news of the hoax came a day after a report released by the city s inspector general found that the top performers on two recent fire department promotions exams likely cheated amid lapses in testing security _meta_end_dot_

 a black firefighters group had called accusations of cheating racially motivated after union officials questioned the test scores _meta_end_dot_

 but the investigation found that five african american firefighters had studied by using a _meta_number_ref_ exam which is against test protocol _meta_end_dot_

 on nov _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ a handwritten note and a rope were discovered about _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ a m _meta_end_dot_

 by two fire department employees one black and one white _meta_end_dot_

 it read we cant sic hang the cheaters but we can hang the failures _meta_end_dot_

 no emt i no job a small stick figure with a noose and the word stop were drawn below the message _meta_end_dot_

 the note appeared to refer to the cheating investigation and a push by top fire officials to compel emergency medical technicians to become certified as paramedics _meta_end_dot_

 maynard was among those whose jobs were at risk _meta_end_dot_

 in a written statement yesterday fire chief william j _meta_end_dot_

 goodwin jr _meta_end_dot_

 said maynard had admitted to conducting a scheme meant to create the perception that members within our department were acting in a discriminatory and unprofessional manner firefighter unions in baltimore are outraged out how the city s mayor and black groups rushed to judgement and fanned racial tensions kevin cartwright a spokesman for the fire department said that maynard s punishment had not been determined but that he could be fired _meta_end_dot_

 clifford the spokesman for dixon said she was pleased to find out that in fact there wasn t a threat of that nature made at the firehouse he said the mayor is disappointed in the firefighter _meta_end_dot_

 it s a terrible thing to be worried that firefighters are treating each other that way and it s good to know they re not he said _meta_end_dot_

 yesterday the leaders of the two city fire unions denounced dixon whose initial reaction to the reported incident was to deplore what she called an act of hatred and intimidation stephan g _meta_end_dot_

 fugate head of the city fire officers union said dixon s reaction contributed to racial tensions _meta_end_dot_

 he said members of the community became hostile toward firefighters after the mayor came out and in effect said racism is running rampant union leaders also criticized the local chapter of the national association for the advancement of colored people and the vulcan blazers a group that represents black firefighters saying they too provoked racial tension by rushing to judgment _meta_end_dot_

 to put it mildly this time we re not going to let it go said fugate _meta_end_dot_

 the reaction from the naacp the mayor and the vulcan blazers was sickening and we re going to demand an apology but in typical naacp fashion the president of the baltimore naacp is still treating the black firefighter as a victim but marvin l _meta_end_dot_

 doc cheatham president of the naacp s baltimore chapter said the fact that such an incident could occur shows that pervasive racial problems persist in the department _meta_end_dot_

 it really saddens us to hear that evidently things have reached a stage that even an african american does an injustice to himself and his own people as a result of a negative culture in that department cheatham said when asked to respond to the unions _meta_end_dot_

 once a victim always a victim even when the victim perpetrates the crime _meta_end_dot_

 let s take a look at some of the initial reactions when this hate crime was initially reported emphasis added yesterday the local chapter of the national association for the advancement of colored people and the vulcan blazers a group that represents black city firefighters demanded a federal investigation into the rope and note while the fire union s president said critics should not jump to conclusions _meta_end_dot_

 in a written statement mayor sheila dixon said she was outraged by this deplorable act of hatred and intimidation _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 threats and racial attacks are unacceptable anywhere especially in a firehouse at a news conference at the vulcan blazers headquarters near druid hill park president henry burris said his organization would demand a federal investigation by the justice department _meta_end_dot_

 we know there s been racial issues with the baltimore city fire department but this has reached the final level burris said _meta_end_dot_

 because whoever perpetrated it whether they know it or not this has reached the level of a federal hate crime marvin l _meta_end_dot_

 doc cheatham president of the naacp s baltimore chapter referred to the note as a threat and said it should be treated as such _meta_end_dot_

 it s got to go federal cheatham said _meta_end_dot_

 joseph armstead a former firefighter and current vice president of the local chapter of the naacp said a culture of racism has always existed in the city fire department _meta_end_dot_

 i m not really shocked or surprised said armstead a firefighter for _meta_number_ref_ years _meta_end_dot_

 it s just getting outward now _meta_end_dot_

 and we re not going to tolerate that but apparently they re not too concerned about the obvious racism that is rampant within their own organization judging by their over reactions to the fake noose incident _meta_end_dot_

 btw regarding the mayor s reaction to the intial reporting of the incident here s what she said would happen to the person responsible for leaving the noose and note she said anyone found guilty of using that note and leaving that noose in the fire station will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law _meta_end_dot_

 you don t see that in the wjz article itself which has strangely been edited not to include that part of the mayor s statement but you do hear see it in the video as reporter gigi barrnet reports what the mayor said about the incident _meta_end_dot_

 i found the cached version of dixon s comments here which won t find in the uncached page the citizens of baltimore expect public safety professionals to live up to the highest moral and ethical standards and i do too _meta_end_dot_

 i will not tolerate this kind of behavior from members of the fire department or other city employees _meta_end_dot_

 the police and fire departments will conduct a thorough investigation _meta_end_dot_

 we will punish those responsible for this to the fullest extent of the law in retrospect mayor dixon should have been more honest and said any white person found to have committed this act would be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law _meta_end_dot_

 fake hate crime incidents in baltimore to her at least apparently don t count _meta_end_dot_

 and as far as apologies go _meta_end_question_

 i won t hold my breath on that happening _meta_end_dot_
