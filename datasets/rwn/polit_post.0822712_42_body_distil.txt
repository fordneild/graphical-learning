  since history always repeats itself there have been a lot of people trying to figure out which election we re repeating this time around _meta_end_dot_

 is it lincoln vs _meta_end_dot_

 mcclellan _meta_end_question_

 wilkie vs _meta_end_dot_

 fdr _meta_end_question_

 bush vs _meta_end_dot_

 dukakis _meta_end_question_

 i d say it s reagan vs _meta_end_dot_

 carter _meta_end_dot_

 now that s not to say obama is another reagan _meta_end_dot_

 to the contrary reagan was de facto leader of the conservative movement in america when he ran for president while obama is an insufferable lightweight a mere empty suit _meta_end_dot_

 however politically the situation is very similar _meta_end_dot_

 in _meta_number_ref_ the american people were sick to death of jimmy carter _meta_end_dot_

 however the election turned into a referendum on ronald reagan _meta_end_dot_

 was he ready to lead _meta_end_question_

 could he be trusted in the white house _meta_end_question_

 was he just an actor with a great personality or was he the real deal _meta_end_question_

 in this election the american people are sick to death of george bush and the republican party _meta_end_dot_

 however the election has turned into a referendum on barack obama _meta_end_dot_

 does he have the experience to lead _meta_end_question_

 can he be trusted to deal with a crisis at _meta_number_ref_ am in the white house _meta_end_question_

 is he the real deal or he just a young good looking celebrity ultimately reagan s two terms as governor of california his years on the road talking about conservative issues and his substantive approach to the issues of the day convinced the american people that they could trust him in the white house and they happily kicked jimmy carter to the curb for him _meta_end_dot_

 of course again it goes without saying that obama is no reagan mccain is no jimmy carter and the country is much more divided today than it was in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 still in the end who ends up the in the white house is going to revolve around one key issue is barack obama ready to lead _meta_end_question_

 the conclusion most people come to on that question will probably determine who the next president of united states is going to be _meta_end_dot_
