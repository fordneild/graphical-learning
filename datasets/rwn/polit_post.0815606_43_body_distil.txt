  the line that said it all we re going to make america great again _meta_end_dot_

 here here _meta_end_dot_

 you know what i mean _meta_end_dot_

 oh and with obama the ocean will cease to rise the planet will heal children will not get sick and america s image will be restored _meta_end_dot_

 he s the miracle man text of speech here because if we are willing to work for it and fight for it and believe in it then i am absolutely certain that generations from now we will be able to look back and tell our children that this was the moment when we began to provide care for the sick and good jobs to the jobless this was the moment when the rise of the oceans began to slow and our planet began to heal this was the moment when we ended a war and secured our nation and restored our image as the last best hope on earth _meta_end_dot_

 this was the moment this was the time when we came together to remake this great nation so that it may always reflect our very best selves and our highest ideals _meta_end_dot_

 this was the moment _meta_end_question_

 now that obama is nominated we ve entered the promised land hope _meta_end_exclamation_

 change _meta_end_exclamation_

 i believe _meta_end_exclamation_

 i believe _meta_end_exclamation_

 the scariest line remake this great nation if it s great why does it need to be remade _meta_end_question_

 and how exactly does he plan to remake it besides taking profits from oil companies how forcing clean energy how forcing car companies to make more efficient cars how and creating millions and zillions of jobs that won t go overseas how _meta_end_dot_

 did you like the speech as much as i did _meta_end_question_

 i mean besides the vapid substance the form was pretty great _meta_end_dot_

 oh and one more thing my least favorite tick of obama s is the nose in the air gazing in the distance look _meta_end_dot_

 he does it when he s soaking in the adoring chanting creepy crowds _meta_end_dot_

 yes we can _meta_end_exclamation_

 yes we can bleh _meta_end_dot_
