  some people believe that liberals and conservatives are just flip sides of the same coin when it comes to the judiciary but that s not so _meta_end_dot_

 conservatives believe judges should adhere to the original intent of the constitution and not try to usurp the role of the legislature _meta_end_dot_

 on the other hand most liberals care little about the constitution and view judges as just another way to advance left wing policies _meta_end_dot_

 quotes like the following from the new york times help give the game away mr _meta_end_dot_

 mccain predictably criticized liberal judges vowed strict adherence to the founders views and promised to appoint more judges in the mold of chief justice john roberts and justice samuel alito _meta_end_dot_

 that is just what the country does not need the new york times via newsbusters so among other things judges with strict adherence to the founders views are just what the country does not need that s like saying umpires who impartially do their job without favor to either team are just what this sport doesn t need
