  the only canadian magazine to publish the infamous mohammed cartoons the western standard is no more but their group blog the shotgun remains active _meta_end_dot_

 after some initial defiance the new owners just apologized to a well known muslim troublemaker he d gone to the police _meta_beep_ref_ complaining about anonymous anti muslim comments at the blog _meta_end_dot_

 i hope their capitulation isn t a sign of things to come _meta_end_dot_

 i m talking of course about the other muslim activists bullying another canadian magazine merely for publishing an excerpt of mark steyn s bestselling book america alone _meta_end_dot_

 the story is getting international attention canadians and americans alike have contacted prime minister harper expressing their concerns about this ridiculous persecution _meta_end_dot_

 the best one stop shop for all the latest developments on this very important case is the cheeky entertaining blog free mark steyn _meta_end_dot_

 this story threatens to drag on for months as steyn and the magazine in question don t get hauled before the human rights commission kangaroo courts until well into _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 luckily the free mark steyn blog is poised to keep up informed and entertained for the duration _meta_end_dot_

 well done binkie _meta_end_exclamation_

 of course in a decent world such blogs would be unnecessary _meta_end_dot_
