  the kleptocrats at the un are still trying to cajole the united states into giving up control of the internet when hundreds of technology experts from around the world gather here this week to hammer out the future of the internet the hottest issue won t be spam phishing or any of the other phenomena that bedevil users everywhere _meta_end_dot_

 instead ending u s _meta_end_dot_

 control over what s become a global network will be at the top of the agenda for many of the more than _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ participants expected at the united nations internet governance forum which begins monday _meta_end_dot_

 with the internet now dominating nearly aspect of modern life continued u s _meta_end_dot_

 control of the medium has become a sensitive topic worldwide _meta_end_dot_

 in nations that try to control what people can see and hear the internet often is the only source of uncensored news and opinion _meta_end_dot_

 u s _meta_end_dot_

 officials say that keeping internet functions under their control has protected that free flow of information and kept the internet growing reliably _meta_end_dot_

 yet to many foreign government officials and technology gurus the united states has too much control over a tool that s used by more than _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ billion people worldwide _meta_end_dot_

 brazil china and other countries have proposed transferring oversight to an international body _meta_end_dot_

 others worry however that transferring the administration of the internet to the united nations or another international body would make it vulnerable to censorship especially by powerful countries such as china _meta_end_dot_

 the most dramatic example of internet censorship happened recently in myanmar when the ruling military junta cut internet connections to stop dissident blogs and other sites that had distributed information about government repression in the wake of september s crushed pro democracy protests _meta_end_dot_

 our concern is that countries that have been the most vocal advocate of changing control of the internet are not countries that support an open internet said leslie harris the president of the center for democracy technology a nonprofit u s _meta_end_dot_

 open internet advocacy group _meta_end_dot_

 should the u n _meta_end_dot_

 gain control of the internet the conservative u s _meta_end_dot_

 research center the heritage foundation wrote on its web site it would give meddlesome governments the opportunity to censor and regulate the medium until its usefulness as a vehicle for freedom of expression and international competition is crippled theresa swinehart icann s vice president of global and strategic participation said the system had proved itself and warned that changes could threaten the internet _meta_end_dot_

 u s _meta_end_dot_

 government officials also argue that keeping the internet under centralized control is best for users _meta_end_dot_

 when the european union suggested creating an intergovernmental body to oversee icann in _meta_number_ref_ secretary of state condoleezza rice and commerce secretary carlos gutierrez responded forcefully _meta_end_dot_

 burdensome bureaucratic oversight is out of place in an internet structure that has worked so well for many around the globe they said in a letter here s a thought for all the people complaining about american control of the internet we created the internet we built it out and we made it into a success _meta_end_dot_

 if you don t like the fact that we control it then you can kiss our american sses _meta_end_dot_

 so all you weenies at the united nations internet governance forum can shake your little fists in the air impotently for as long as you want and rant about the united states but it s not going to make one iota of difference _meta_end_dot_

 we re not handing the internet over so you can tax it so that petty un bureaucrats can make themselves feel important by regulating it and so that totalitarian nations like china myanmar and saudi arabia can demand changes in the way that the net works to make it easier for them to control it _meta_end_dot_

 that s how it is and how it s going continue to be like it or not _meta_end_dot_

 so debate it all you like it s not going to make one bit of difference _meta_end_dot_
