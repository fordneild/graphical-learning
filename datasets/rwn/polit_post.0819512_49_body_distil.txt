  a mazing stuff these bright guys who represent us come up with a top democrat told high school students gathered at the u s _meta_end_dot_

 capitol thursday that climate change caused hurricane katrina and the conflict in darfur which led to the black hawk down battle between u s _meta_end_dot_

 troops and somali rebels _meta_end_dot_

 no _meta_end_dot_

 really _meta_end_dot_

 i mean what is wrong with you all you have to do is connect the dots in somalia back in _meta_number_ref_ climate change according to _meta_number_ref_ three and four star generals resulted in a drought which led to famine said markey _meta_end_dot_

 that famine translated to international aid we sent in to somalia which then led to the u s _meta_end_dot_

 having to send in forces to separate all the groups that were fighting over the aid which led to black hawk down _meta_end_dot_

 there was this scene where we have all of our american troops under fire because they have been put into the middle of this terrible situation he added _meta_end_dot_

 climate change drought famine _meta_end_dot_

 according to _meta_number_ref_ not _meta_number_ref_ or _meta_number_ref_ but _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ and _meta_number_ref_ star generals hmmm _meta_end_question_

 huh _meta_end_dot_

 no mention of that civil war that was going on is there _meta_end_question_

 following the downfall of president siad barre in _meta_number_ref_ a civil war broke out in somalia between the faction supporting interim president ali mahdi mohamed and that supporting general mohamed farah aidid _meta_end_dot_

 the united nations in cooperation with the organization of african unity oau and other organizations sought to resolve the conflict _meta_end_dot_

 the secretary general in _meta_number_ref_ dispatched an envoy to whom all faction leaders expressed support for a united nations peace role _meta_end_dot_

 the united nations also became engaged in providing humanitarian aid in cooperation with relief organizations _meta_end_dot_

 the war had resulted in nearly _meta_number_ref_ million refugees and almost _meta_number_ref_ million people threatened by hunger and disease _meta_end_dot_

 and then to make matters worse while addressing katrina this intellectual powerhouse was reduced to quoting the goracle markey also told the students that there no longer exists any debate about whether or not disasters like katrina are caused by climate change _meta_end_dot_

 there now is no question that this harm is being caused by human activity said markey _meta_end_dot_

 it s warming up the planet and melting the glaciers _meta_end_dot_

 there is an underwater heat wave going on _meta_end_dot_

 the waters get warmer and warmer and that intensifies the storms and creates even greater havoc when those storms reach land the planet is running a fever _meta_end_dot_

 it s heating up but there is no emergency rooms for planets he said _meta_end_dot_

 the worst consequences affect the planet not only new orleans but the whole planet _meta_end_dot_

 last but certainly not least his parting words to the children back _meta_number_ref_ years ago women rose up and said we want the right to vote and they were successful he said _meta_end_dot_

 now you are like the green generation and you are rising up and saying we must ensure the planet does not suffer the worst consequences of climate change oh _meta_end_dot_

 my head hurts _meta_end_dot_

 in case some of you still don t know who this guy is he s rep _meta_end_dot_
