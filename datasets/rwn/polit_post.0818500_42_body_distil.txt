  we re right in the middle of a feisty yet dreadfully dull election season seriously with patriot obama and his patriot wife i feel like i m watching an endless loop of the hope for change chronicles of pretend patriotism where the story is stale the acting is painful and we re all just commiserating over how bad life will be when those people on the television run the world kinda like the sixth season of _meta_number_ref_ but with even more politically correct appeasement _meta_end_dot_

 i ve already decided on the whatevs vote for president whatevs being the bad republican because socialism has so far killed more people than illegal immigration and campaign finance reform combined i think _meta_end_dot_

 so i ve checked out already wake me in november if there s something good on television _meta_end_dot_

 i still check the headlines every day and read the funny political stuff i didn t give a rat s toenail about politics until i learned about political humor to stay informed basically so i ll know what the heck frank is talking about most of the time _meta_end_dot_

 today i came across this telegraph headline and about peed my pants in shock barack obama national rifle association campaigns to keep him out of white house um thanks captain obvious for your amazing insight _meta_end_dot_

 but of course i couldn t stop reading because the headline itself made me laugh _meta_end_dot_

 america s gun lobby is to launch an expensive advertising campaign this autumn designed to stop barack obama winning the presidential election _meta_end_dot_

 i would have thought they d try to stop the pro gun candidate _meta_end_dot_

 under obama s picture they have a cute little description _meta_end_dot_

 mr obama was careful to state his support for gun ownership but he is also a supporter of a ban on semi automatic weapons mr obama was careful after that ruling to state his support for gun ownership but he is also a supporter of a ban on semi automatic weapons most concealed weapons and a limit on the number of handguns bought to one a month _meta_end_dot_

 most concealed weapons _meta_end_dot_

 so _meta_end_dot_

 maybe a swiss army knife _meta_end_question_

 or is that too weapony _meta_end_question_

 toothpicks are dangerous if you conceal them and if someone attacks you with a _meta_number_ref_x_meta_number_ref_ you should definitely not have the ability to remove his splinters because that might hurt someone _meta_end_dot_

 the significance of the campaign for mr obama is two fold _meta_end_dot_

 it is likely to entrench opposition to his candidacy among white working class voters in the appalachian region who overwhelmingly supporter sic his opponent hillary clinton during the primary elections _meta_end_dot_

 typical white people _meta_end_dot_

 the answer to your question is no that never gets old however robert gibbs mr obama s communications secretary said we think we ll get the votes of plenty of gun owners and gun owners will have a home with the obama campaign if by gun owners mr _meta_end_dot_

 gibbs means musket owners he might be on to something _meta_end_dot_

 sarahk blogs about tv at snark raving mad and other stuff at mountaineer musings _meta_end_dot_

 she s married to frank j _meta_end_dot_

 and has three cats and a dog all of whom could totally pwn patton _meta_end_dot_
