  question this is more of a request than a question _meta_end_dot_

 it s become clear that the troll problem at rwn is starting to get out of control _meta_end_dot_

 sock puppets and stalker trolls keep showing up and the moderators seem either unwilling or unable to get rid of them _meta_end_dot_

 often their posts are left up for days at a time and by the time they are finally deleted the thread is already hijacked beyond all repair _meta_end_dot_

 i emailed you about this previously and you replied that the trolls are adept at using various software tricks to get around a banning _meta_end_dot_

 i m only marginally tech savvy so i ll have to take your word for it that this is true but several people myself included have raised suggestions of ways to help get this problem back under control _meta_end_dot_

 my question is this would consider implementing one or more of the following suggestions _meta_end_question_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 creating a more concrete yet still flexible system of rules for rwn forums _meta_end_dot_

 at the moment we have an extremely vague list of rules don t flame excessively don t use an exceptional amount of vulgar language don t be a jerk which i believe is insufficient _meta_end_dot_

 it leaves the question of whether to delete or ban a poster almost entirely up to the subjective judgement of your moderators _meta_end_dot_

 i feel that if we had a more precise rules system a clear definition of what trolling entails would be a good example this would remove the subjective element and improve the atmosphere considerably _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 a report button attached to every post that would allow us to flag posts we believe are in violation of the rules _meta_end_dot_

 i believe that part of the reason why your moderators take so long to spot and delete troll posts is because they are forced to scan through upwards of _meta_number_ref_ to _meta_number_ref_ posts or more in order to find and delete them _meta_end_dot_

 if they were able to jump immediately to repeatedly flagged posts this problem would be essentially solved _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 hiring more moderators or hiring better moderators _meta_end_dot_

 i don t know if it s because the current mods aren t doing their job or that there simply aren t enough of them but something needs to be done _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 requiring email confirmation in order for people to register on rwn _meta_end_dot_

 i m told that this could permanently end the problem of the recurring trolls _meta_end_dot_

 that s all i can think of at the moment so i encourage other posters on this thread to suggest more ideas i realize that these may not all be feasible but i would appreciate if you would at least consider them mightysamurai answer let s take them one at a time _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ create a more concrete yet still flexible system of rules for rwn forums this is a catch _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 you keep the rules a little vague and people complain that you re not being specific enough _meta_end_dot_

 if you make the rules very specific you ll have people who try to be as irritating as humanly possible while staying within the letter of the law so that you can t ban them _meta_end_dot_

 since those are the options i prefer to keep it a little vague _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ a report button would be a good idea but i would have to pay someone to do a lot of coding to make it work _meta_end_dot_

 it s not a bad idea it s just something that would be difficult to implement _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ as far as the moderators go i m very happy with the people we ve got _meta_end_dot_

 they re doing a great job _meta_end_dot_

 that being said i might add another moderator or two _meta_end_dot_

 however that can be a double edged sword _meta_end_dot_

 the more people you have moderating the more problems you tend to have with people being too quick on the trigger finger _meta_end_dot_

 yes you have less trolls but you also have more legitimate posts that tend to get deleted for one reason or another _meta_end_dot_

 in some forums i ve even seen it get out of hand to the point where you have moderators deleting every post certain people make just because they don t like them _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ email confirmation doesn t help much with re occurring trolls because it s very easy to get a valid email address _meta_end_dot_

 you can head over to hotmail and have one in _meta_number_ref_ minutes _meta_end_dot_

 here are two other things to keep in mind _meta_end_dot_

 a there are really _meta_number_ref_ approaches you can take with a comments section or a forum _meta_end_dot_

 the first is to do very little moderating and banning and just let things evolve on their own _meta_end_dot_

 if you do this you end up with a sewer _meta_end_dot_

 on the other hand you can go in the opposite direction have a lot of rules a lot of moderators and run an extremely tight ship _meta_end_dot_

 this approach ends up producing an enormous workload and incessant complaining _meta_end_dot_

 the third approach which is sort of a middle way is how i ve tried to go about it and i think it has worked out not perfectly but pretty well over time _meta_end_dot_

 since early _meta_number_ref_ rwn has added _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ comment posters _meta_end_dot_

 of course some of them are spam accounts trolls duplicates etc but if there are that many people signing up something has to be working out pretty well _meta_end_dot_

 b last but not least i m sure you ve heard the saying don t feed the troll well that s good advice that people too seldom take _meta_end_dot_

 you have to understand persistent trolls as opposed to the people who just make a jackass of themselves get banned and leave are people who have difficulty engaging in normal interactions with other human beings _meta_end_dot_

 so they settle for getting any kind of attention even if it s a go to hell or a screw you in other words trolling is just another way for them to say please please notice me that s why when i do a deletion on a troll i delete the troll and the responses to him _meta_end_dot_
