  over at the democratic underground forums they have a poll question that is posed like this george walker bush is a war criminal the _meta_number_ref_ invasion of iraq was his crime _meta_end_dot_

 agree disagree or do you have a different opinion here are the results so _meta_percent_ref_ of the libs over at the democratic underground who i think are very representative of liberals in general think that invading iraq was a war crime _meta_end_dot_

 okay _meta_end_dot_

 let s consider that _meta_end_dot_

 if choosing to invade iraq was a war crime bush is certainly a war criminal _meta_end_dot_

 of course so are all the soldiers who participated in the invasion _meta_end_dot_

 i mean i was just following orders is not defense for committing a war crime _meta_end_dot_

 moreover the resolution to invade iraq was approved _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ in the senate and _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ in the house _meta_end_dot_

 among the senators who voted in favor of the iraq war resolution which was for all intents and purposes signing off on the invasion of iraq were hillary clinton john edwards tom daschle richard gephardt max cleland john kerry chuck hagel diane feinstein and harry reid _meta_end_dot_

 so i guess if invading iraq was a war crime bush will have a lot of company in the pokey _meta_end_dot_

 ps there are a lot of liberals who are excited about the idea of trying to put members of the bush administration in jail on trumped up charges _meta_end_dot_

 they should keep in mind that it s one thing to make those kind of threats but if they ever implement them well just remember if conservatives ever go to jail over policy differences the same thing will eventually happen to liberals as well _meta_end_dot_
