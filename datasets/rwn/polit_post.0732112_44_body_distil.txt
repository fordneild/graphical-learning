  many conservatives believe that human life begins at conception and that destruction of human embryos in scientific research such as cloning research is wrong _meta_end_dot_

 meanwhile the left often claims that those who object to research using human embryos are standing in the way of scientific progress and saving lives _meta_end_dot_

 that claim was presented rather dramatically for example when actor chrisopher reeves lobbied for embryonic stem cell research in the hopes that it might lead to cures for ailments such as his paralysis resulting from a fall from a horse _meta_end_dot_

 science however marches to its own rhythm _meta_end_dot_

 quietly unnoticed in recent years have been a series of defeats for scientists attempting to clone embryos _meta_end_dot_

 meanwhile scientists investigating other types of stem cells that do not raise ethical concerns including adult stem cells have met with some surprising success _meta_end_dot_

 now a reputable scientist who pioneered cloning of embryos has said that the future of stem cell research lies in adult stem cells not human embryonic stem cells _meta_end_dot_

 professor ian wilmut the scientist who cloned dolly the sheep in _meta_number_ref_ has concluded that cloning human embryos is not necessary because scientists are having greater success turning adult human cells back into stem cells _meta_end_dot_

 prof wilmut who works at edinburgh university believes a rival method pioneered in japan has better potential for making human embryonic cells which can be used to grow a patient s own cells and tissues for a vast range of treatments from treating strokes to heart attacks and parkinson s and will be less controversial than the dolly method known as nuclear transfer his announcement could mark the beginning of the end for therapeutic cloning on which tens of millions of pounds have been spent worldwide over the past decade _meta_end_dot_

 i decided a few weeks ago not to pursue nuclear transfer prof wilmut said _meta_end_dot_

 most of his motivation is practical but he admits the japanese approach is also easier to accept socially his inspiration comes from the research by prof shinya yamanaka at kyoto university which suggests a way to create human embryo stem cells without the need for human eggs which are in extremely short supply and without the need to create and destroy human cloned embryos which is bitterly opposed by the pro life movement _meta_end_dot_

 prof yamanaka has shown in mice how to turn skin cells into what look like versatile stem cells potentially capable of overcoming the effects of disease _meta_end_dot_

 this pioneering work to revert adult cells to an embryonic state has been reproduced by a team in america and prof yamanaka is according to one british stem cell scientist thought to have achieved the same feat in human cells _meta_end_dot_

 this work has profound significance because it suggests that after a heart attack for example skin cells from a patient might one day be manipulated by adding a cocktail of small molecules to form muscle cells to repair damage to the heart or brain cells to repair the effects of parkinson s _meta_end_dot_

 because they are the patient s own cells they would not be rejected _meta_end_dot_

 in theory these reprogrammed cells could be converted into any of the _meta_number_ref_ other type in the body even the collections of different cell types that make up tissues and in the very long term organs too _meta_end_dot_

 prof wilmut said it was extremely exciting and astonishing and that he now plans to do research in this area _meta_end_dot_

 this approach he says represents the future for stem cell research rather than the nuclear transfer method that his large team used more than a decade ago at the roslin institute near edinburgh to create dolly _meta_end_dot_

 in the case of embryonic stem cell research there has been almost a knee jerk reaction from the left to concerns about the morality of destroying human embryos _meta_end_dot_

 the more the right is against it the more the left is for it _meta_end_dot_

 the left has pushed hard for state and federal authorization and funding of human embryonic stem cell research _meta_end_dot_

 the next time you hear someone pushing for more embryonic stem cell research you might want to point out that the leading pioneer in embryonic cloning professor wilmut believes that the future of stem cell research lies in use of adult stem cells not embryonic cells _meta_end_dot_

 in addition look at the results _meta_end_dot_

 while human embryonic stem cell research is languishing we ve already seen amazing developments involving use of non embryonic stem cells _meta_end_dot_

 for example scientists may soon be able to grow new heart valves for babies using cells normally shed by fetuses into the amniotic flud _meta_end_dot_

 scientists are learning how to grow new organs inside the human body _meta_end_dot_

 other scientists are learning how to turn fat into smooth muscle cells _meta_end_dot_

 in june of this year researchers at whitehead institute in massachusetts modified a skin cell so that it behaved like an embryonic stem cell making use of human embryos unnecessary _meta_end_dot_

 it s nice when science and ethics both point in the same direction _meta_end_dot_

 that doesn t always happen _meta_end_dot_

 there are times when scientific progress and ethics seem to be in conflict _meta_end_dot_

 at those times we still need to have the courage to ask not only what is possible but also what is right if you enjoyed this post visit gina cobb
