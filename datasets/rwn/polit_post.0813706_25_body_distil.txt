  you think i am brave because i carry a gun well your fathers are much braver because they carry responsibility for you your brothers your sisters and your mothers _meta_end_dot_

 and this responsibility is like a big rock that weighs a ton _meta_end_dot_

 it bends and it twists them until finally it buries them under the ground _meta_end_dot_

 and there s nobody says they have to do this _meta_end_dot_

 they do it because they love you and because they want to _meta_end_dot_

 i have never had this kind of courage _meta_end_dot_

 running a farm working like a mule every day with no guarantee anything will ever come of it _meta_end_dot_

 this is bravery charles bronson in the magnificent seven you can scarcely pick up a paper these days without reading about someone talking about rights however the word responsibilities doesn t seem to come up as often _meta_end_dot_

 that s a shame because our responsibilities are every bit as important as our rights in fact the responsibilities are more important in some ways because of our nature _meta_end_dot_

 we human beings are born savages not much different than highly intelligent wolves _meta_end_dot_

 it s only because we have been socialized civilized taught better and bathed in the grace of god that we have the wherewithal to live together respectfully in a civilized society _meta_end_dot_

 moreover because men are bigger stronger and more naturally aggressive than women we particularly need to be schooled on what our duties are not just as human beings but as men _meta_end_dot_

 to begin with a real man should be able to shoot a gun catch a fish hunt take and throw a punch know what to do if a tornado or hurricane hits cook a steak jump start a car change a tire drive a stick shift give a firm handshake read a map handle a budget swim tie a tie give a _meta_number_ref_ minute speech comfort someone who has just had a loved one die negotiate a raise or a price on something he s going to buy and tell a pushy salesman no however real men understand that their responsibilities don t end with mere skills _meta_end_dot_

 men have duties that go far beyond that _meta_end_dot_

 men have an obligation to treat women with respect to open doors to pull out chairs to pay for dinner on a date to act in a chivalrous manner and a real man wouldn t physically hurt a woman if you put a gun to his head _meta_end_dot_

 in other words a man should show a woman the same respect that he would want another man to show to his sister or mother _meta_end_dot_

 additionally not every man is going to be a president ceo or general but every man should be able to lead and act responsibly when the situation calls for it _meta_end_dot_

 he is the one ultimately responsible for his own life his own family and for setting an example _meta_end_dot_

 not everybody has the same religious beliefs or version of patriotism but men should understand that standing up for god country and what s right is important because it sets a much needed example for others to follow _meta_end_dot_

 that s why being a pistol toting gang banger or a pick up artist with five children by five different mothers doesn t make you a real man although people sometimes confuse that sort of bad behavior with manhood _meta_end_dot_

 a real man isn t just the sort of guy you d want to cover your back in a fight or someone you d want with you if you were trying to meet women a man who deserves to be emulated is decent loyal trustworthy courteous and feels an almost instinctive outrage at injustice and desire to protect the weak _meta_end_dot_

 real men are responsible honorable and do what needs to be done _meta_end_dot_

 as long as this country never runs short of men like that the greatest country on god s green earth will continue to thrive prosper and show the rest of the world how it should be done _meta_end_dot_
