  so now we are in this orwellian paradox of seeing obama s base turn out in record numbers on the basis apparently of race but on the other hand the implied warning that if anyone else were likewise to consider that fact then he would be racialist _meta_end_dot_

 so is he an identity politics candidate or a post racialist unifier _meta_end_question_

 or both _meta_end_question_

 it all reminds me of the perennial complaints of the national council of la raza the race lecturing insensitive others about their unfair consideration of race in matters of illegal immigration _meta_end_dot_

 this is very disappointing because lost in obamania is the complete repudiation of his original promise precisely not to become a racial candidate victor davis hanson bonus quote after his victory last week in wisconsin and again at the austin debate obama revealed himself to be the most liberal candidate since george mcgovern _meta_end_dot_

 he is not thrilled with building a border fence _meta_end_dot_

 he wants to meet with raul castro _meta_end_dot_

 he will raise taxes and spend a boatload of money on new programs _meta_end_dot_

 he will exit iraq pronto and spend that money on domestic programs _meta_end_dot_

 he opposes any restriction on partial birth abortion and thinks the district of columbia s total handgun ban is a common sense regulation jennifer rubin
