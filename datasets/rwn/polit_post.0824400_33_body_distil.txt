  to me the first good thing about the palin nomination is that it highlights obama s inexperience _meta_end_dot_

 you can just hear him going around the house muttering i know you are but what am i _meta_end_question_

 i know you are but what am i _meta_end_question_

 i know you are but what am i to date obama has written two self serving books been editor of the law review a student job during which time he wrote only one anonymous note served _meta_number_ref_ years in a state legislature which is a collegial not an executive position and in which he did not distinguish himself been a law professor who left no tracks whatsoever spent almost his entire time in the us senate another collegial not managerial job running for the presidency worked as an associate in a small law firm associates are never managerial and been a community organizer whatever that means _meta_end_dot_

 significantly his one executive experience was a complete bust despite being a nothing and a nobody at the time he was put in charge of a _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ project to improve chicago schools _meta_end_dot_

 although he effectively channeled money to his political friends the program made not a bit of difference to chicago s profoundly damaged educational institutions _meta_end_dot_

 it s a busy resume but in terms of performance outcome an undistinguished one _meta_end_dot_

 palin s bio isn t much thicker but it shows her having a more executive experience and b more successful outcomes _meta_end_dot_

 she s raised four children and is working on raising a fifth which is already a level of executive experience people who haven t raised children don t appreciate _meta_end_dot_

 she spent several as a successful mayor of a small ish town which can be likened to being the ceo of a _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ strong corporation _meta_end_dot_

 significantly she s been a wildly successful courageous and non partisan scourge of corrupt alaska politicians and big oil interests governor palin has always run as the anti corruption candidate _meta_end_dot_

 she served as ethics commissioner of the alaska oil and gas conservation commission from _meta_number_ref_ to _meta_number_ref_ when she resigned in protest over the actions of her fellow alaskan gop leaders including then alaskan governor frank murkowski _meta_end_dot_

 she was furious over the fact that they ignored her reports of rampant gop corruption _meta_end_dot_

 when she chose to run for governor the gop establishment ignored her and supported the incumbent murkowski _meta_end_dot_

 palin beat him and went on to beat former democratic governor tony knowles with no support from alaskan gop leadership _meta_end_dot_

 she has actively supported and helped the gop primary opponents of current indicted alaskan senator ted stevens and representative don young and denounced both of them often in public _meta_end_dot_

 oh and the forthcoming claim that palin s in the pocket of big oil _meta_end_question_

 her ethics complaints were filed against people who really were in the pocket of big oil she was on the outside investigating _meta_end_dot_

 lastly separate from her success rooting out corruption she s proven to be a very competent governor of alaska _meta_end_dot_

 and to to those who are snarky about alaska s small population it s worth pointing out that while it comes in at _meta_number_ref_ out of _meta_number_ref_ joe biden s delaware comes in at _meta_number_ref_ out of _meta_number_ref_ and he s never managed anything in his state anyway _meta_end_dot_

 keeping all of the above in mind it was laughable to see the frenzy into which scholars flogged themselves when speaking of palin s historically significant inexperience so unconventional was mccain s choice that it left students of the presidency literally stunned in the words of joel goldstein a st _meta_end_dot_

 louis university law professor and scholar of the vice presidency _meta_end_dot_

 being governor of a small state for less than two years is not consistent with the normal criteria for determining who s of presidential caliber said goldstein _meta_end_dot_

 i think she is the most inexperienced person on a major party ticket in modern history said presidential historian matthew dallek _meta_end_dot_

 or maybe these scholars haven t been sleeping at all they re just so blinded by partisanship they don t realize how stupid they sound _meta_end_dot_

 as to the partisanship that s not me talking that s the mccain campaign _meta_end_dot_

 because respectable left leaning blogs are more honest than the msm politico in which the scholar s take first appeared updated its post with this statement from the mccain camp the authors quote four scholars attacking gov _meta_end_dot_

 palin s fitness for the office of vice president _meta_end_dot_

 among them david kennedy is a maxed out obama donor joel goldstein is also an obama donor and doris kearns goodwin has donated exclusively to democrats this cycle _meta_end_dot_

 finally matthew dallek is a former speech writer for dick gephardt _meta_end_dot_

 this is not a story about scholars questioning gov _meta_end_dot_

 palin s credentials so much as partisan democrats who would find a reason to disqualify or discount any nominee put forward by sen _meta_end_dot_

 mccain cross posted at bookworm room _meta_end_dot_
