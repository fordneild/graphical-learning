  fred thompson drew some attention this week end by pointing out correctly in my opinion that fox news has been biased against his campaign in an interview on fox news sunday host chris wallace pressed thompson on how some conservatives have lambasted thompson s campaign and showed clips of fox conservative commentators charles krauthammer and fred barnes criticizing the former senator _meta_end_dot_

 thompson said this has been a constant mantra of fox to tell you the truth he noted that other conservatives have praised his bid for the gop nomination and took issue with a fox promo that focused on polling in new hampshire where thompson is registering in the single digits _meta_end_dot_

 he said he is running second in national polls and has been leading or tied for the lead in south carolina for a long long time thompson in a firm but measured tone scolded wallace for you to highlight nothing but the negatives in terms of the polls and then put on your own guys who have been predicting for four months really that i couldn t do it kind of skew things a little bit _meta_end_dot_

 there s a lot of other opinion out there is this true _meta_end_question_

 in my opinion absolutely _meta_end_dot_

 in fact i ve had people complain to me privately about the way that fox news attacks fred thompson _meta_end_dot_

 now this doesn t seem to jive with the whole idea of fox being the conservative network but you have to look at the whole picture _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ fox is the conservative network but only in comparison to the other mainstream media outlets _meta_end_dot_

 truth be told fox isn t nearly as representative of conservative opinion as say a lot of the big talk radio hosts or even the right side of the blogosphere _meta_end_dot_

 as a matter of fact i d go so far as to say that if you re just watching fox and don t listen to talk radio or read blogs you don t have any idea of what most conservatives really think because guys like bill o reilly fred barnes william kristol may be to the right of center but they re out of the conservative mainstream in a lot of areas take illegal immigration for example where fox with the exception of hannity seemed to be generally supportive of the comprehensive illegal immigration bill being shoved through the senate while most conservatives hated it _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ many inside the beltway republicans including the ones at fox have come across as being very hostile to fred thompson _meta_end_dot_

 maybe that s because they ve succumbed to the same cultural forces that have convinced republicans in congress that you have to abandon your conservative principles to win elections _meta_end_dot_

 maybe they re just biased towards northeastern pols like romney and giuliani because they re living in that part of the country _meta_end_dot_

 maybe most of them had already picked their candidates before fred got in the race and they re reluctant to change horse mid stream _meta_end_dot_

 but there has definitely been a weird disconnect between the conservative punditocracy and the conservative grassroots on fred thompson _meta_end_dot_

 the punditocracy doesn t like him while he seems to be the single most popular candidate by a good ways amongst conservative activists _meta_end_dot_

 as far as fred s campaign goes he s _meta_number_ref_nd in national polls ahead of romney third in the first primary in iowa ahead of giuliani tied for _meta_number_ref_st place in south carolina with romney and is likely to be the top republican candidate in fund raising during the _meta_number_ref_th quarter of this year _meta_end_dot_

 fox can sneer at thompson if they like but he is in the thick of the race and has a real shot to win the nomination _meta_end_dot_

 will he win _meta_end_question_

 i don t know but he certainly deserves a lot better than he has gotten from fox and most of the other beltway insiders in dc _meta_end_dot_
