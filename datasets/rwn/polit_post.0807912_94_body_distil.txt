  so here s question if you knew a year ago that wright was saying things so anti american so dishonest so hateful that you were going to have to disown him then why did you only disown him when it became such a big political issue _meta_end_question_

 and if you thought what he was saying was false and wrong and to be condemned why didn t you care enough for him to try to teach him the truth _meta_end_question_

 i don t think he can have it both ways _meta_end_dot_

 if he can t give a different opinion to reverend wright who he has known for _meta_number_ref_ years i sure don t want him visiting the dictator ahmadinejad or visiting the younger castro brother _meta_end_dot_

 this is a core question of character _meta_end_dot_

 how can you ask me to believe that this guy who has said he wants to visit kim jung il he thinks the president of the united states ought to talk to anybody _meta_end_dot_

 he can t even talk to his own pastor _meta_end_question_

 i mean one of two things are true _meta_end_dot_

 either he has always believed these were terrible things in which case he showed a remarkable lack of courage in describing to his own minister the truth or he didn t actually mind it as long as it wasn t public newt gingrich
