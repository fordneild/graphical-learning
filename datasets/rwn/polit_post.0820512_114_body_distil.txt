  when liberals thought it was politically expedient to declare iraq lost that was what they did _meta_end_dot_

 liberal after liberal after liberal told us that we could not win in iraq that the surge was a waste of time and that we should leave asap _meta_end_dot_

 for example there s time s joe klein _meta_end_dot_

 klein like hillary clinton and john edwards supported the war in iraq initially when it was politically popular and then changed his position later when the political winds blew the other way _meta_end_dot_

 by january of _meta_number_ref_ klein was in full cut and run mode and writing things like this pelosi s right though it s too late for a surge _meta_end_dot_

 instead of putting all its brainpower into surging the military should be focusing on how to get our conventional forces out and leave our unconventional forces in the neighborhood in a way that prevents an all out regional conflict for the record i m outraged bush is ignoring the election results and the reality on the ground in iraq _meta_end_dot_

 i think he is sending more young american lives into an impossible situation _meta_end_dot_

 now here s joe klein yesterday at time s swampland blog the reality is that neither barack obama nor nouri al maliki nor most anybody else believes that the iraq war can be lost at this point _meta_end_dot_

 the reality is that no matter who is elected president we are looking at a residual u s _meta_end_dot_

 force of _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ by _meta_number_ref_ a year ahead of the previous schedule _meta_end_dot_

 so initially it was too late for a surge and the situation was impossible so we needed to leave as quickly as possible _meta_end_dot_

 now it s impossible to lose so we need to leave as quickly as possible _meta_end_dot_

 incidentally this is exactly the same line of reasoning that barack obama has been using _meta_end_dot_

 he opposed the surge and believed we should leave iraq in _meta_number_ref_ months because the situation was unwinnable _meta_end_dot_

 now his new line is that we should leave in _meta_number_ref_ months because things are going so well that they won t need us and ironically klein s post yesterday was sharply critical of john mccain for having the chutzpah to tell the truth about barack obama this is a clear choice that the american people have _meta_end_dot_

 i had the courage and the judgment to say i would rather lose a political campaign than lose a war _meta_end_dot_

 it seems to me that obama would rather lose a war in order to win a political campaign _meta_end_dot_

 if anything mccain s comments were too limited because they apply just as aptly to klein and most of the other big name political pundits on the left who have consistently and soullessly been putting politics ahead of the good of their country and winning the war in iraq for years _meta_end_dot_

 ps i would be thrilled if we actually could have _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ troops in iraq by _meta_number_ref_ but that s a decision that should be made after consultation with our generals based on the situation on the ground not a decision that should be made based on political calculations designed to move votes for the _meta_number_ref_ election _meta_end_dot_
