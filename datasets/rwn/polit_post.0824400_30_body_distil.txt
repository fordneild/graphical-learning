  via rick a discussion taking place on desperate preacher kicked off by pam with some comments that are truly asinine noteworthy in john mccain s recent commercials he calls himself the original maverick _meta_end_dot_

 in our household we ve had some different responses to this _meta_end_dot_

 i d like to know how you hear it and what you think he s trying to communicate _meta_end_dot_

 first time we heard the commercial both my husband and son started yelling goose much to my amazement _meta_end_dot_

 i didn t understand it at all _meta_end_dot_

 they said it was a reference to top gun and that maverick was a character in the movie as was goose _meta_end_dot_

 i pictures guns and cowboy hats and a swagger down a dusty street _meta_end_dot_

 neither of these images work for me as an appeal for presidential character _meta_end_dot_

 any thoughts _meta_end_question_

 comment at rick s place speaks for itself _meta_end_dot_

 dp by banning rick has indicated that the place desires to be an echo chamber above all other things so i ll keep my silence there out of respect for their wishes rev pam wishes to broadcast to the world wide web that she has never seen high noon before _meta_end_dot_

 very well _meta_end_dot_

 noted _meta_end_dot_

 arguably if this is not the best western movie ever made it could very well be the western movie with the strongest connection to the unsettling conundrums that surface from time to time in real life _meta_end_dot_

 in fact i would argue that this is what makes a western movie _meta_end_dot_

 clarity of moral definition coupled with ambiguity about what to do _meta_end_dot_

 personal safety placed in the corner directly opposite from the make sure good prevails over evil corner _meta_end_dot_

 that s why our leftists hate cowboys so much _meta_end_dot_

 well it s true _meta_end_dot_

 high time someone said so _meta_end_dot_

 fuquod being a keyboard building fool chimes in with the discredited chickenhawk argument and rick did you even attempt to serve _meta_end_question_

 personally doing something then you have no business thinking positive thoughts about anybody else who is doing it nor are you permitted to so much as to acknowledge audibly or in silence that what they do needs doing _meta_end_dot_

 the argument they seek to make depends completely on this nonsensical premise _meta_end_dot_

 not just a little bit _meta_end_dot_

 completely _meta_end_dot_

 so i figure every time i read this argument and it was typed into a computer somewhere whoever said it must build keyboards for a living _meta_end_dot_

 i mean the accusation they re leveling is one of hypocrisy so i know no way could those guys be hypocrites _meta_end_dot_

 they have to be building keyboards _meta_end_dot_
