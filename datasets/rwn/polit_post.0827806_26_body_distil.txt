  the consensus is in from the right side of the blogosphere that sarah palin won hands down in the vp debate _meta_end_dot_

 several on the left have even conceded _meta_end_dot_

 she regained the momentum and one part of the debate that sticks out are all of the lies joe biden said that are easy to expose _meta_end_dot_

 rove only summarized a portion of the long list of lies from biden _meta_end_dot_

 lies are politics as usual not the change promised from the ticket he rides on _meta_end_dot_

 is she really the new reagan _meta_end_question_
