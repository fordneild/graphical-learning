  rachel lucas wants to start a new category on her blog possibly called most people are too stupid to vote but they do anyway so we are all going to die i already have a category we re all gonna die but i usually reserve that for the latest bird flu epidemic global warming or other bout of unhinged hysteria put forth by the elites aimed at enslaving the masses so it s kinda related _meta_end_dot_

 rachel is despondent because most americans are idiots _meta_end_dot_

 yes well that can give you a lifelong depression if you think about to much _meta_end_dot_

 there is a solution though for the screwballs who think things like this a rasmussen reports national telephone survey found that _meta_percent_ref_ of voters favor nationalizing the oil industry _meta_end_dot_

 just _meta_percent_ref_ are opposed and _meta_percent_ref_ are not sure _meta_end_dot_

 here s my proposal america should go back to the good old days when only those who own property can vote _meta_end_dot_

 if you don t have a vested interest in a piece of property you just don t have a vested interest _meta_end_dot_

 also it would help if a person could read and as some of rachel s readers suggested pass a common civics exam _meta_end_dot_

 of course that would eliminate obama and his _meta_number_ref_ states from voting too _meta_end_dot_
