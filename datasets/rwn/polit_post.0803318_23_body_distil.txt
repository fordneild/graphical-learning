 jim demint r s c says the city of berkeley calif no longer deserves federal money _meta_end_dot_

 demint was angered after learning that the berkeley city council voted this week to tell the u s _meta_end_dot_

 marine corps to remove its recruiting station from the city s downtown _meta_end_dot_

 this is a slap in the face to all brave service men and women and their families demint said in a prepared statement _meta_end_dot_

 the first amendment gives the city of berkeley the right to be idiotic but from now on they should do it with their own money if the city can t show respect for the marines that have fought bled and died for their freedom berkeley should not be receiving special taxpayer funded handouts he added _meta_end_dot_

 demint said he will draft legislation to rescind any earmarks dedicated for the city of berkeley in the recently passed appropriations bill which his office tallied to value about _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ million _meta_end_dot_

 he said that any money taken back would be transferred to the marines _meta_end_dot_

 demint s office provided a preliminary list of items that would be subject to his proposal _meta_end_dot_

 excellent _meta_end_dot_

 if they hate the u s a _meta_end_dot_

 so much why should they benefit from our tax dollars _meta_end_question_

 so call your senator and tell them to support senator jim demint s efforts and let them know that most americans are patriotic and love their men and women in uniform _meta_end_dot_
