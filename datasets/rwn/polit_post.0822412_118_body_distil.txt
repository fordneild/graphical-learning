 ignore them _meta_end_dot_

 ignore the early adopter critics that never have enough to play with _meta_end_dot_

 ignore your investors that want proven tactics and predictable instant results _meta_end_dot_

 listen instead to your real customers to your vision and make something for the long haul _meta_end_dot_

 because that s how long it s going to take guys _meta_end_dot_

 here s another thing it s not just patience _meta_end_dot_

 it s hard work _meta_end_dot_

 most don t consider it work _meta_end_dot_

 it s their love and they ve parlayed it into a job or career but they re working all the same _meta_end_dot_

 their job gives their lives meaning and mission _meta_end_dot_

 in fact it s likely that their work is their mission _meta_end_dot_

 lots of smart people have lots of smart ideas that never see the light of day because they never take the risk to work _meta_end_dot_

 and it s a daily grind oftentimes or can be _meta_end_dot_

 and sometimes the work that you find important other people think is stupid or useless _meta_end_dot_

 conversely some throw away efforts surprise you because it s well received _meta_end_dot_

 go figure _meta_end_dot_

 either way if the work wasn t done and the risk taken nothing would have been accomplished _meta_end_dot_

 so go to work and hang in there _meta_end_dot_

 success will follow _meta_end_dot_
