  here are the _meta_number_ref_ dumbest moments from b o s i am the nominee speech with my brief comments following after each one _meta_number_ref_ at this defining moment for our nation we should be proud that our party put forth one of the most talented qualified field of individuals ever to run for this office _meta_end_dot_

 should we be proud that the least talented least qualified person in the field actually won _meta_end_question_

 _meta_number_ref_ in just a few short months the republican party will arrive in st _meta_end_dot_

 paul with a very different agenda _meta_end_dot_

 they will come here to nominate john mccain a man who has served this country heroically _meta_end_dot_

 i honor that service and i respect his many accomplishments even if he chooses to deny mine _meta_end_dot_

 my differences with him are not personal they are with the policies he has proposed in this campaign _meta_end_dot_

 it s hilarious that he dings mccain for denying his accomplishments and then doesn t list them _meta_end_dot_

 what are they supposed to be _meta_end_question_

 he has made it to the us senate and defeated hillary clinton _meta_end_dot_

 has he done anything else of note that would merit a mention in the race for the presidency _meta_end_question_

 anything _meta_end_question_

 _meta_number_ref_ i won t stand here and pretend that there are many good options left in iraq but what s not an option is leaving our troops in that country for the next hundred years obama keeps bringing this nonsensical point up over and over _meta_end_dot_

 it has gotten to the point where you have to wonder if mr _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ states even understands that we have had troops in places like germany japan and korea for a long time after the fighting in those nations ended _meta_end_dot_

 if this guy doesn t even know how many states there are he may not know that we ve been in those nations for all these years either _meta_end_dot_

 after all in the iq department obama is definitely on the back end of the curve for a us senator _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ maybe if he went to pennsylvania and met the man who lost his job but can t even afford the gas to drive around and look for a new one he d understand that we can t afford four more years of our addiction to oil from dictators _meta_end_dot_

 that man needs us to pass an energy policy that works with automakers to raise fuel standards and makes corporations pay for their pollution and oil companies invest their record profits in a clean energy future an energy policy that will create millions of new jobs that pay well and can t be outsourced _meta_end_dot_

 that s the change we need _meta_end_dot_

 ok so we have a man who can t afford gas and none of the solutions obama offers will reduce the cost of gas _meta_end_dot_

 it was amazing to hear people clap for this idiocy _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ what you won t hear from this campaign or this party is the kind of politics that uses religion as a wedge and patriotism as a bludgeon well i bet obama isn t going to be attacking anyone on their patriotism and religious issues _meta_end_dot_

 that s why they say people in glass houses shouldn t throw stones _meta_end_dot_

 it would be like my ripping on someone for being conservative and southern _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ i am absolutely certain that generations from now we will be able to look back and tell our children that this was the moment when we began to provide care for the sick and good jobs to the jobless this was the moment when the rise of the oceans began to slow and our planet began to heal this was the moment when we ended a war and secured our nation and restored our image as the last best hope on earth _meta_end_dot_

 this was the moment this was the time when we came together to remake this great nation so that it may always reflect our very best selves and our highest ideals _meta_end_dot_

 so we re not caring for the sick and the jobless can t get jobs _meta_end_question_

 the unemployment rate is _meta_number_ref_ _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 obama is going to affect the level of the oceans _meta_end_question_

 what _meta_end_question_

 america isn t the last best hope on earth any more and obama is going to be the guy to fix that _meta_end_question_

 in all seriousness if that were our problem would someone as inept as barack obama be the guy we d want to tackle it _meta_end_question_

 _meta_number_ref_ in our country i have found that this cooperation happens not because we agree on everything but because behind all the labels and false divisions and categories that define us beyond all the petty bickering and point scoring in washington americans are a decent generous compassionate people united by common challenges and common hopes _meta_end_dot_

 and every so often there are moments which call on that fundamental goodness to make this country great again _meta_end_dot_

 america isn t great now but if we elect barack obama all fundamentally good people will vote for him and the country will be great again _meta_end_question_

 oh please save us barack _meta_end_exclamation_

 what a low opinion of this country and a high opinion of himself this guy has _meta_end_dot_

 ps it s fascinating that so many people gave obama high marks for this speech _meta_end_dot_

 yes he delivered it well but it was absolutely riddled with idiocy _meta_end_dot_

 the stupid doesn t just disappear because obama is good at reading what people write for him _meta_end_dot_
