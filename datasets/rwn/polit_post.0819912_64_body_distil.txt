  the senate approved the president s emergency plan for aids relief pepfar agreeing to give away _meta_dollor_ref_ billion of american taxpayer money to african countries to help stop the spread of aids _meta_end_dot_

 current estimates are that _meta_number_ref_ million people worldwide suffer from the disease _meta_end_dot_

 that is less than one half of one percent of the total population _meta_end_dot_

 the washington post describes how aids in africa was overstated the united nations started to revise its estimates in light of the new studies in its _meta_number_ref_ report reducing the number of infections in africa by _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ million back to the total four years earlier of _meta_number_ref_ million _meta_end_dot_

 it also gradually decreased the overall infection rate for working age adults in sub saharan africa from _meta_number_ref_ percent in a _meta_number_ref_ report to _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ percent in its latest report released in november _meta_end_dot_

 peter ghys an epidemiologist who has worked for unaids since _meta_number_ref_ acknowledged in an interview from his office in geneva that hiv projections several years ago were too high because they relied on data from prenatal clinics _meta_end_dot_

 but ghys said the agency made the best estimates possible with the information available _meta_end_dot_

 as better data emerged such as the new wave of national population studies it has made revisions where necessary he said _meta_end_dot_

 what has happened is we have come to realize that indeed we have overestimated the epidemic a bit he said _meta_end_dot_

 on its web site unaids describes itself as the chief advocate for worldwide action against aids and many researchers say the united nations reliance on rigorous science waned after it created the separate aids agency in _meta_number_ref_ the first time the world body had taken this approach to tackle a single disease _meta_end_dot_

 in the place of previous estimates provided by the world health organization outside researchers say the aids agency produced reports that increasingly were subject to political calculations with the emphasis on raising awareness and money _meta_end_dot_

 it s pure advocacy really said jim chin a former u n _meta_end_dot_

 official who made some of the first global hiv prevalence estimates while working for who in the late _meta_number_ref_s and early _meta_number_ref_s _meta_end_dot_

 once you get a high number it s really hard once the data comes in to say whoops _meta_end_exclamation_

 it s not _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 it s _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ the way the politicians in washington talk you would think we were on the brink of a pandemic _meta_end_dot_

 one time presidential hopeful joe biden called pepfar the the single most significant thing the president has done rino senator richard lugar said the program has helped to prevent instability and societal collapse in a number of at risk countries republican tom coburn who fought to ensure the funding actually went towards treatment and not other programs said this is our most successful foreign policy initiative in my lifetime _meta_end_dot_

 this is the most effective thing we have done to build america s prestige esteem and respect that may very well be but it remains to be seen if it is money spent wisely _meta_end_dot_

 the ap reports the white house which supports the new bill said the president s emergency plan for aids relief known as pepfar has helped bring lifesaving anti retroviral drugs to some _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ million people and has supported care for nearly _meta_number_ref_ million including about _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ million aids orphans and vulnerable children _meta_end_dot_

 before the program began only _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ in all of sub saharan africa were receiving anti retroviral drugs _meta_end_dot_

 those are some compelling statistics _meta_end_dot_

 according to avert com at the end of _meta_number_ref_ there were an estimated _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ million people living with hiv in sub saharan africa the part below the sahara desert and _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ in north africa and the middle east _meta_end_dot_

 aids is now the leading cause of death in sub saharan africa killing an estimated _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ million people in _meta_number_ref_ alone _meta_end_dot_

 in the same year another _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ million became infected with hiv out of _meta_number_ref_ million infected world wide _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ million live in sub saharan africa _meta_end_dot_

 what is going on there that is resulting in such high numbers _meta_end_question_

 part of it could be the bangui definition for aids _meta_end_dot_

 in _meta_number_ref_ the centers for disease control and the world health organization met in bangui central african republic _meta_end_dot_

 it was here they created the bangui definition which was to be used to diagnose aids when hiv tests were not available _meta_end_dot_

 that s right they are not even checking for hiv _meta_end_dot_

 the bangui definition lists specific symptoms the health service provider should look for such as weight loss exceeding _meta_percent_ref_ of body weight continuous or repeated attacks of fever for more than a month cough diarrhea lasting for more than a month generalized adenopathy swollen lymphnodes yeast infection physical weakness and loss of strength _meta_end_dot_

 if you have combination of those symptoms that get a score of _meta_number_ref_ on the scorecard you have aids _meta_end_dot_

 good thing there aren t any other diseases common in africa with those same symptoms _meta_end_dot_

 another thing that might be causing two thirds of the world s aids patients to live in africa is false positives caused by pregnancy or other diseases endemic to africa _meta_end_dot_

 on page _meta_number_ref_ of hiv aids and reproductive health caution pdf the cdc writes all hiv testing is subject to error and laboratory workers with less experience have high rates of false results they also wrote about the need for follow up tests due to the high rate of false positive screening tests so in the instance where they are not relying on yeast infection to diagnose aids there is a probability of false positives _meta_end_dot_

 with the lack of hiv tests in africa how often do you think there is a follow up test _meta_end_question_

 but let s give the doctors and nurses the benefit of the doubt and say that all of the people they have diagnosed with aids actually have the disease _meta_end_dot_

 first off how did they get it _meta_end_question_

 according to avert com there are a few things that influence the rate at which hiv is transmitted such factors include poverty economic disparity social instability gender inequality sexual violence other sexually transmitted infections which facilitate hiv transmission lack of male circumcision high mobility rapid urbanisation and modernisation and ineffective leadership during critical periods in the epidemic s spread _meta_end_dot_

 well there it is _meta_end_dot_

 it s that damn poverty again _meta_end_dot_

 that explanation for the spread of aids in africa may be the scariest thing i read in researching this article _meta_end_dot_

 if this is how they think it is spreading no wonder it is going gangbusters _meta_end_dot_

 while we know how this is being spread did you know that at one time the percentage of infected ugandans dropped from _meta_percent_ref_ to _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_end_question_

 that was before help arrived in the late _meta_number_ref_s before international experts arrived to tell us we had it all wrong we in uganda devised a practical campaign to prevent the spread of hiv _meta_end_dot_

 we recognized that population wide aids epidemics in africa were driven by people having sex with more than one regular partner _meta_end_dot_

 therefore we urged people to be faithful _meta_end_dot_

 our campaign was called abc abstain or be faithful or use condoms but our main message was stick to one partner _meta_end_dot_

 we promoted condoms only as a last resort _meta_end_dot_

 because we knew what to do in our country we succeeded _meta_end_dot_

 the proportion of ugandans infected with hiv plunged from _meta_number_ref_ percent in _meta_number_ref_ to _meta_number_ref_ percent in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 during the same time the percentage of ugandan men with more than three sexual partners dropped from _meta_percent_ref_ to _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 it seems the people responsible for this program knew what they were doing and were even running this program for _meta_number_ref_ cents a person per year _meta_end_dot_

 compare that to _meta_dollor_ref_ a person per year for retro viral drugs and you can see the size of their success _meta_end_dot_

 but international aids experts who came to uganda said we were wrong to try to limit people s sexual freedom _meta_end_dot_

 worse they had the financial power to force their casual sex agendas upon us _meta_end_dot_

 pepfar calls for western experts to work as equal partners with african leaders on aids prevention _meta_end_dot_

 but as co chair of uganda s national aids prevention committee i have seen this process sabotaged _meta_end_dot_

 repeatedly our _meta_number_ref_ member prevention committee put faithfulness and abstinence into the national strategic plan that guides how pepfar money for our country will be spent _meta_end_dot_

 repeatedly foreign advisers erased our recommendations _meta_end_dot_

 when the document draft was published fidelity and abstinence were missing _meta_end_dot_

 condoms were still on the list though _meta_end_dot_

 however according to the san francisco chronicle condoms meant for free distribution are routinely sold according to rev _meta_end_dot_

 sam l _meta_end_dot_

 ruteikara co chair of uganda s national aids prevention committee as fidelity and abstinence have been subverted uganda s hiv rates have begun to tick back up billions of dollars in exported liberalism _meta_end_dot_

 and as usual quinn s first law rings true _meta_end_dot_

 in america the federal government spends _meta_number_ref_ times more money on aids as we do on cancer _meta_end_dot_

 it spend _meta_number_ref_ times more money on aids as we do on heart disease _meta_end_dot_

 anti stroke funding _meta_end_question_

 aids gets _meta_number_ref_ times more money _meta_end_dot_

 as reported in the new york post the ryan white act mandates taxpayer handouts to hiv aids victims of about _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ billion a year _meta_end_dot_

 we have no remotely similar program for victims of any other disease all this money for a disease that the world health organization s top hiv expert says is largely confined to gay men drug addicts and prostitutes and their clients i e _meta_end_dot_

 largely preventable _meta_end_dot_

 let s get money over there to help them but the same amount of money congress and bush want to give away could be generated through charity _meta_end_dot_

 back in _meta_number_ref_ bill gates gave _meta_dollor_ref_ million to fight against aids in africa _meta_end_dot_

 warren buffet donated _meta_dollor_ref_ billion to the gates foundation _meta_end_dot_

 they are just two of _meta_number_ref_ billionaires in the world _meta_end_dot_

 last year jerry lewis raised _meta_dollor_ref_ million in less than _meta_number_ref_ hours _meta_end_dot_

 also in _meta_number_ref_ americans gave _meta_dollor_ref_ billion to charity on top of what they paid in taxes _meta_end_dot_

 as generous as the american citizen already is there is no reason for our government to pay another _meta_dollor_ref_ billion for prestige esteem and respect if _meta_dollor_ref_ billion in charity a year isn t enough another _meta_dollor_ref_ billion isn t going to impress anyone _meta_end_dot_

 besides the government has other issues they need to focus on _meta_end_dot_
