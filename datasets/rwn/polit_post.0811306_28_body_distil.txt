  this is just dumb the sign in front of a small church in a small town is causing a big controversy in jonesville s c _meta_end_dot_

 pastor roger byrd said that he just wanted to get people thinking _meta_end_dot_

 so last thursday he put a new message on the sign at the jonesville church of god _meta_end_dot_

 it reads obama osama hmm are they brothers _meta_end_question_

 byrd said that the message wasn t meant to be racial or political _meta_end_dot_

 it s simply to cause people to realize and to see what possibly could happen if we were to get someone in there that does not believe in jesus christ he said _meta_end_dot_

 when asked if he believes that barack obama is muslim byrd said i don t know _meta_end_dot_

 see it asks a question are they brothers _meta_end_question_

 in other words is he muslim _meta_end_question_

 i don t know _meta_end_dot_

 he says he s not _meta_end_dot_

 i hope he s not _meta_end_dot_

 but i don t know _meta_end_dot_

 and it s just something to try to stir people s minds _meta_end_dot_

 it was never intended to hurt feelings or to offend anybody obama is not a muslim _meta_end_dot_

 period _meta_end_dot_

 end _meta_end_dot_

 of _meta_end_dot_

 story _meta_end_dot_

 people who suggest that obama is a muslim at this point even after he has been flayed alive for being part of an anti white racialist christian church for more than a decade are only making themselves look uninformed _meta_end_dot_

 although obama has a myriad of different faults even he can t simultaneously be a muslim and a christian at the same time _meta_end_dot_

 so geeze give the obama is a muslim_meta_beep_ref_ stuff a rest _meta_end_dot_

 hat tip to the drudge report
