  as a multilingual immigrant english russian enough hebrew and spanish to get by i m not exactly worried about those strange people from strange lands _meta_end_dot_

 i m one of those people _meta_end_exclamation_

 but yes i m an english only partisan and here s why it s better for the immigrants _meta_end_dot_

 i know this from experience and i know this for a fact _meta_end_dot_

 sure government offices can have their spanish signs to make it easier for immigrants _meta_end_dot_

 but their local supermarket probably won t _meta_end_dot_

 the job they want will likely be in english _meta_end_dot_

 i really believe it s anti immigrant to not help them assimilate _meta_end_dot_

 the russians i know who never had to learn english because the signs on brighton beach are in russian they have rtv and listen to a russian radio station are so much worse off than the russians i know who learned english and adapted to their new country _meta_end_dot_

 the former have such limited opportunities it s not even funny _meta_end_dot_

 the latter well they re americans and have every door open to them that someone american born would have _meta_end_dot_

 i don t want to deprive new immigrants of america s promise karol sheinin
