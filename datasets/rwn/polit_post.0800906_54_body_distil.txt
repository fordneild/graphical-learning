  did diebold help hillary rig new hampshire or was it the bradley effect _meta_end_question_

 i know you re probably thinking wait a second i thought diebold was supposed to be a firm that was in the bag for republicans so why would they be helping hillary clinton steal the election in new hampshire i have no idea but when hillary took new hampshire despite poll after poll after poll that indicated obama would win i knew that liberals would say the fix was in and i wasn t disappointed _meta_end_dot_

 here s the the brad blog with an explanation i m not sure why obama would have conceded so soon given the virtually inexplicable turn of events in new hampshire tonight _meta_end_dot_

 what s going on here _meta_end_question_

 before proceeding i recommend you read the third section of the post i just ran an hour or so ago concerning the way the ballots are counted in new hampshire largely on diebold optical scan voting systems wholly controlled and programmed by a very very bad company named lhs associates _meta_end_dot_

 those diebold op scan machines are the exact same ones that were hacked in the hbo documentary hacking democracy _meta_end_dot_

 see the previous report as i recommend which also includes a video of that hack and footage of the guy who runs lhs associates _meta_end_dot_

 while i have no evidence at this time let me repeat no evidence at this time of chicanery what we do know is that chicanery with this particular voting system is not particularly difficult _meta_end_dot_

 particularly when one private and a less than respectable one at that as i detailed in the previous post runs the entire process _meta_end_dot_

 i should also note that some _meta_percent_ref_ of new hampshire s precincts are hand counted which equals about _meta_percent_ref_ of the votes _meta_end_dot_

 i ve just spoken to bev harris of blackboxvoting org who seems to share my concern as have other folks who follow this sort of thing _meta_end_dot_

 harris noted that it will be interesting to compare numbers of the hand counted precincts with those counted on the hackable diebold op scan systems _meta_end_dot_

 if i was barack obama i d certainly not have conceded this election this quickly _meta_end_dot_

 i m not quite sure what he was thinking _meta_end_dot_

 and as far as offering an indication of whether he understands how these systems work and the necessity of making sure that votes are counted and counted accurately it does not offer a great deal of confidence at this hour _meta_end_dot_

 the effect of obama being an african american the so called bradley effect is now being discussed as the newest reason to explain the numbers _meta_end_dot_

 though it s noted that it didn t effect harold ford in tn in _meta_number_ref_ or even obama in iowa just five days ago _meta_end_dot_

 incidentally my best guess is that the bradley effect is indeed responsible for obama s loss because he definitely appeared headed for victory if you looked at the polls _meta_end_dot_

 what s the bradley effect you ask _meta_end_question_

 well as black candidates reaching out to largely white constituencies have discovered in the past when it comes to measuring political popularity there are lies damned lies and polls on which they rest their fate at their peril _meta_end_dot_

 the phenomenon was first widely noted in _meta_number_ref_ when los angeles mayor tom bradley lost a squeaker of a race for governor after being widely projected as the winner _meta_end_dot_

 douglas wilder also came up against the bradley effect when he barely won the _meta_number_ref_ contest for governor of virginia after leading comfortably in the polls _meta_end_dot_

 ronald walters of the university of maryland was at wilder s hotel as a projected easy victory turned into a nail biter _meta_end_dot_

 that is a night i ll never forget says walters who thinks it naive to believe that things have changed very much _meta_end_dot_

 he believes that some percentage of whites perhaps _meta_number_ref_ percent or so intent on being seen as less biased than they may be will claim to support a nonwhite candidate when they actually do not in iowa because everyone could see how everyone else was voting it may have actually boosted obama s numbers a bit _meta_end_dot_

 but in new hampshire the bradley effect may have kicked in _meta_end_dot_

 moreover in a democratic primary where you have a lot of politically correct white liberals participating you may see an even stronger distortion of polling numbers than you would in a general election _meta_end_dot_

 unless there s some other explanation for how hillary managed to pull nh out of the fire that s better than teh diebold hax_meta_number_ref_red it for hill i m going to stick with the bradley effect as an explanation _meta_end_dot_
