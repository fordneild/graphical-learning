  here are my notes not quotes from a teleconference with tom coburn john shadegg on the enumerated powers act which would require that all bills introduced in the u s _meta_end_dot_

 congress contain a concise and definite statement setting forth the specific constitutional authority relied upon for enactment and establish a point of order in the house and senate for bills that fail to comply note i didn t distinguish between statements made by coburn and shadegg because they often responded to the same question and it was a little difficult to tell them apart at times opening statement the us constitution has a number of enumerated powers and many constitutional scholars would argue that much of the legislation we are enacting is beyond the scope of what we are allowed to do _meta_end_dot_

 this bill is an attempt to rein in congress and would requires the congress to cite a specific clause in the constitution that allows us to legislate in a particular area _meta_end_dot_

 this would enable and inspire the court to make a decision whether the constitution gives us the authority to legislate in a particular area _meta_end_dot_

 q a session could you give us some examples of how the congress has overstepped its constitutional authority _meta_end_question_

 in the assault weapon ban the congress imposed upon state and local sheriffs the duty to regulate guns _meta_end_dot_

 a sheriff challenged it and said that congress had no right to tell him what to do _meta_end_dot_

 the scotus agreed with him and said that congress couldn t tell him to take action _meta_end_dot_

 there are many many other examples of such legislation _meta_end_dot_

 one of the reasons we ve had trouble passing this is that people might argue all kinds of legislation are illegal _meta_end_dot_

 spending has spun out of control because the restraint on spending that once came from the constitution is no longer there _meta_end_dot_

 much of that comes from the fact that we pass legislation day in and day out that there is no constitutional authority for and the courts don t stop us _meta_end_dot_

 is there any bipartisan support for this _meta_end_question_

 no democrat has decided to do the right thing and support this bill _meta_end_dot_

 however there are _meta_number_ref_ republican co sponsors in the senate and _meta_number_ref_ in the house _meta_end_dot_

 this would lead to a big battle on social security wouldn t it _meta_end_question_

 it doesn t make social security illegal per se but it would lead to a debate _meta_end_dot_

 currently our debate over spending is only over whether we can afford it _meta_end_dot_

 a further restraint could and should be whether congress is allowed to do it _meta_end_dot_

 whether this bill passes or not we re going to have this debate one way or the other _meta_end_dot_

 we can have the debate now or in a time of crisis _meta_end_dot_

 we re talking about doubling everybody s income medicare and social security taxes in the future to keep us even and no accumulate debt _meta_end_dot_

 that s what it will eventually come to if we don t do something _meta_end_dot_

 what most americans don t understand is that there is a missing person in the offices of members of congress _meta_end_dot_

 day in and day out people walk in and say they have an idea for a wonderful program _meta_end_dot_

 but the person not in the room is someone saying that may be a good idea but what will it cost and what burden will it impose on the public nobody argues the opposite side of the equation so the founding fathers wanted a limited government that couldn t do anything it wanted _meta_end_dot_

 how do you sell this to the public _meta_end_question_

 it ties into government waste and spending _meta_end_dot_

 i think this is an opportunity to move arguments over government spending from a we can t afford it to can we do this perspective as well _meta_end_dot_

 do you think the american people want this _meta_end_question_

 don t they want more spending _meta_end_question_

 why did the democrats take over congress _meta_end_question_

 because they made a compelling case for big spending or because they made a compelling case that republicans who promised lower spending broke their word _meta_end_question_

 i think it s the latter _meta_end_dot_

 americans got discouraged not because we created a smaller government and it didn t work but because we broke our promise to create a smaller government _meta_end_dot_
