  el presidente has resigned _meta_end_exclamation_

 breaking news_meta_beep_ref_ fidel castro retires to my dearest compatriots who have recently honored me so much by electing me a member of the parliament where so many agreements should be adopted of utmost importance to the destiny of our revolution i am saying that i will neither aspire to nor accept i repeat i will neither aspire to nor accept the positions of president of the state council and commander in chief _meta_end_dot_

 dance on castro s grave snoopy dance _meta_end_exclamation_

 first stop out of power _meta_end_dot_

 second stop surely must be the grave because castro wouldn t give up control of cuba unless he is too sick to hold the reins _meta_end_dot_

 personally i m only sorry that he s going to die of natural causes _meta_end_dot_

 dictators like him deserve to go out like mussolini hung upside down on a meathook or like saddam swung on a rope by the very people he used to enslave _meta_end_dot_

 ps the really sad thing here is that the old monster s legacy of communism and evil won t die with him when he happily expires _meta_end_dot_

 the cuban people deserve to be free and hopefully the bush administration has plans to help make that happen _meta_end_dot_
