  my latest column at townhall is called the top _meta_number_ref_ reasons why barack obama is a weaker candidate than people think _meta_end_dot_

 here s an excerpt from the column he s not qualified to be president in a post _meta_number_ref_ world where the next president is going to be handling the war on terrorism trying to prevent another _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ and dealing with a whole host of critical domestic issues there is absolutely nothing in barack obama s background that indicates he s up to the job _meta_end_dot_

 given the situation are the american people going to choose a young mistake prone extremely inexperienced senator with a history of hard drug use and a knack for making basic geography errors over a _meta_number_ref_ year old pow with more than _meta_number_ref_ years worth of experience in congress _meta_end_question_

 whatever you may think of mccain even a lot of liberals would probably be willing to admit in private that they d rather have him taking that _meta_number_ref_ am phone call after a major terrorist attack than obama _meta_end_dot_

 northern liberals lose national journal ranked barack obama as the single most liberal member of the senate in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 keep in mind that means ted kennedy _meta_end_question_

 not as liberal as barack obama _meta_end_dot_

 what about bernie sanders a self described socialist _meta_end_question_

 not as liberal as barack obama _meta_end_dot_

 the reality is that the gop has been beating liberals particularly northern liberals like barack obama for a long long time _meta_end_dot_

 look back at george mcgovern walter mondale michael dukakis and john kerry _meta_end_dot_

 what s the difference between those guys and barack obama _meta_end_question_

 only color and the fact that obama is even further to the left than those other candidates that the american people thought were too liberal to be president _meta_end_dot_

 you can read it all here _meta_end_dot_
