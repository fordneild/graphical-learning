  canadian authorities have decided they need to go into the homes of senior citizens with guns _meta_end_dot_

 they know who owns guns because the government spent _meta_dollor_ref_ billion yes with a b of our tax dollars to set up a registry of legally owned firearms in a nation with only a small number of legal gun owners why _meta_end_question_

 because they ve heard tell of old folks storing their guns improperly _meta_end_dot_

 our gun storage laws are pretty involved i know i recently passed the written exam required to get a license _meta_end_dot_

 all this is being done without a warrant _meta_end_dot_

 but don t worry you ll get a nice little receipt for your gun if the authorities decide to confiscate it _meta_end_dot_

 now please remember in canada private property is not protected under our charter of rights and freedoms _meta_end_dot_

 like you we have amendments prohibiting unwarranted searches and seizures but unlike you gun owners are considered bad guys and the public generally will shrug at their rights being violated _meta_end_dot_

 keeping this atmosphere in mind your words of advice and encouragement are most welcome _meta_end_dot_
