  from the washington times ron paul says the legions of newcomers his presidential campaign brought to the republican party are getting the cold shoulder from john mccain and from the party _meta_end_dot_

 the texas congressman says neither he nor his supporters have heard from mr _meta_end_dot_

 mccain or republican national committee chairman mike duncan since march _meta_number_ref_ when the arizona senator accumulated enough delegates to clinch the party s presidential nomination _meta_end_dot_

 i don t think they want them mr _meta_end_dot_

 paul told the washington times adding that indifference doesn t surprise him because the party s establishment has deserted traditional conservative principles for big government and foreign intervention _meta_end_dot_

 we don t agree with them he says _meta_end_dot_

 we agree with the old right and they re the new right which is the wrong because the new right has morphed into neoconservative many of his _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ presidential nomination votes were from newcomers to the republican party the kind of dedicated small donor volunteers the party needs he says honest question how in the world can mccain appeal to these people _meta_end_question_

 ron paul has flat out said he isn t going to endorse anyone who s pro war so isn t he going to be useless _meta_end_dot_

 so take away the war issue and what do you have _meta_end_question_

 hard core libertarians _meta_end_question_

 mccain is a fiscal conservative so he may appeal to them on that basis but otherwise there s not going to be a lot he can do to make them happy _meta_end_dot_

 conspiracy kooks _meta_end_question_

 mccain isn t crackers or politically suicidal so he can t really do much to reach out to the truthers and north american union nuts _meta_end_dot_

 white supremacists _meta_end_question_

 mccain isn t a bigot so there s not much he can do there _meta_end_dot_

 people who want to abolish the federal reserve and go back on the gold standard _meta_end_question_

 not happening _meta_end_dot_

 what s left of paul s support once you take those groups out _meta_end_question_

 to be honest not very much _meta_end_dot_

 the problem is that paul s support was built on fringe elements who as a general rule despise the republican party and mainstream conservatives as much as they dislike the left _meta_end_dot_

 as a practical matter i don t see any way of tapping into that group of people without doing something that would be much more damaging in the general election like offering ron paul the veep slot _meta_end_dot_

 if the republican party machinery wants to reach out to these people that s fine _meta_end_dot_

 if ron paul has any ideas of how to get these people on board short of gutting the republican party and turning it into an unelectable libertarian party light i m all ears _meta_end_dot_

 but from what i ve seen of paul s hard core supporters at least _meta_percent_ref_ of them are going to be completely uninterested in any sort of outreach from the republican party _meta_end_dot_
