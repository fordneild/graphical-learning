  as a general rule calling the left oversensitive about race is like calling the sun hot but as barack s numbers have started to soften over the last few weeks the left has started to go around the bend _meta_end_dot_

 as a matter of fact they can t even see the bend at this point _meta_end_dot_

 you ve seen all the frantic and bizarre attacks on the most wildly successful political ad of _meta_number_ref_ celebrity but timothy noah over at slate has actually ratcheted it up another couple of levels in the aug _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ wall street journal amy chozick asked c ould sen _meta_end_dot_

 obama s skinniness be a liability most americans chozick points out aren t skinny _meta_end_dot_

 fully _meta_number_ref_ percent of all citizens who ve reached voting age are overweight and _meta_number_ref_ percent are obese _meta_end_dot_

 to be thin is to be different physically _meta_end_dot_

 not that there s anything wrong mind you with being a skinny person _meta_end_dot_

 but would you want your sister to marry one _meta_end_question_

 would you want a whole family of skinny people to move in next door _meta_end_question_

 i won t vote for any beanpole guy an unnamed clinton supporter wrote on a yahoo politics message board _meta_end_dot_

 my point is that any discussion of obama s skinniness and its impact on the typical american voter can t avoid being interpreted as a coded discussion of race _meta_end_dot_

 chozick insists that she didn t intend her playful feature about obama s physique as potential electoral liability to carry any racial subtext _meta_end_dot_

 i can t even respond to that she told me _meta_end_dot_

 that s ridiculous bob christie dow jones vice president of communications phoned me in a flash to reaffirm that message _meta_end_dot_

 i believe chozick and christie when they say that the journal never intended skinniness to serve as a proxy for race _meta_end_dot_

 but i firmly disagree that a racial reading of chozick s story is ridiculous and i would counter that any failure on chozick s part to recognize such is just a wee bit clueless let s review the basics _meta_end_dot_

 barack obama is the first african american to win a major party nomination for president of the united states _meta_end_dot_

 african americans are distinguishable from other americans by their skin color _meta_end_dot_

 this physical attribute looms large in our nation s history as a source of prejudice _meta_end_dot_

 the promise of obama s presidency in many people s minds is partly that america will move toward becoming a post racial society _meta_end_dot_

 it s pretty clear though that we aren t there yet _meta_end_dot_

 when white people are invited to think about obama s physical appearance the principal attribute they re likely to dwell on is his dark skin _meta_end_dot_

 consequently any reference to obama s other physical attributes can t help coming off as a coy walk around the barn _meta_end_dot_

 a whole genre of humor turns on this reality _meta_end_dot_

 a slate colleague informs me that an episode of the tv sitcom happy days fonzie s new friend had its _meta_number_ref_s era characters nervously discussing the fact that a black man in their midst was so _meta_end_dot_

 skinny _meta_end_dot_

 was it true that skinny people liked fried chicken _meta_end_question_

 that they were good at basketball _meta_end_question_

 and so on _meta_end_dot_

 now i don t know how relevant barack obama s skinniness will turn out to be in the race _meta_end_dot_

 at first glance it does seem like a frivolous topic to write an article about but the presidential race from primary to finish is a nearly two year long experience and it s hard to come up with fresh material _meta_end_dot_

 plus it s not as if people have never discussed this sort of thing before _meta_end_dot_

 in fact i specifically remember someone telling me that the decisive factor in the _meta_number_ref_ race could be that kerry was taller than bush and that it might look bad for w _meta_end_dot_

 if kerry towered over him in the debates _meta_end_dot_

 but frivolous or not frivolous discussing whether obama s thinness could make a difference in the election is unequivocably not racial despite the possible existence of some decades old episode of happy days _meta_end_dot_

 in fact if someone made a claim that off the wall in conversation you d look at them a little differently a little closer right in the eyes so you could see if there was any crazy leaking out of there that you hadn t noticed before _meta_end_dot_

 after all can anybody possibly be this hypersensitive _meta_end_question_

 i d say no no they can t _meta_end_dot_

 to the contrary what s happening is that the left is using a variation on one of their favorite tricks they re trying to shut down debate _meta_end_dot_

 you ve heard the old phrase if you can t beat them join them well the left s version of this is if you can t beat them keep them quiet when it comes to someone like john edwards they ll simply refuse to report criticism _meta_end_dot_

 when it comes to conservative talk radio hosts they ll try to drive them off the air with the fairness doctrine and when it comes to barack obama they will find racist slants on anything and everything negative that is said about the guy in hopes of stopping criticism of him _meta_end_dot_

 it s a vile dishonest un american strategy but it s just what the left is all about these days _meta_end_dot_
