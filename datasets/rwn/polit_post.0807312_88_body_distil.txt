  if you want to see a window into the bizarro worldview of hardcore left wing feminists take a look at this post from feministing _meta_end_dot_

 first of all let me set the stage for you _meta_end_dot_

 here s the headline and first four paragraphs of a disturbing new york times article that inspired the screed at feministing sex infections found in quarter of teenage girls the first national study of four common sexually transmitted diseases among girls and young women has found that one in four are infected with at least one of the diseases federal health officials reported tuesday _meta_end_dot_

 nearly half the african americans in the study of teenagers ages _meta_number_ref_ to _meta_number_ref_ were infected with at least one of the diseases monitored in the study human papillomavirus hpv chlamydia genital herpes and trichomoniasis a common parasite _meta_end_dot_

 the _meta_number_ref_ percent figure compared with _meta_number_ref_ percent of white teenagers health officials and researchers said at a news conference at a scientific meeting in chicago _meta_end_dot_

 the two most common sexually transmitted diseases or s t d s among all the participants tested were hpv at _meta_number_ref_ percent and chlamydia at _meta_number_ref_ percent according to the analysis part of the national health and nutrition examination survey _meta_end_dot_

 there are a lot of reactions that most people probably have to a story like this _meta_end_dot_

 open mouthed disbelief that so many teenage girls are carrying a std complaints about the ineffectiveness of sexual education in schools sorrow for the girls who will be carrying a std for the rest of their lives etc etc _meta_end_dot_

 now let s look at the feministing reaction _meta_end_dot_

 first off the post is titled slut shaming title of the day yes lord knows we wouldn t want to ruin anyone s fun by pointing out that so many teenage girls have stds _meta_end_dot_

 we certainly wouldn t want say a _meta_number_ref_ year old girl out there to look at these numbers and think gee i better not act like a slut or i could end up infected with a disease that i ll carry with me for the rest of my life oh wait did i say infected they have a problem with that too _meta_end_dot_

 using the term infected sounds like there has been an outbreak of birdflu and feeds into the sci fi notion that some incurable disease is spreading that we are powerless against _meta_end_dot_

 yes the problem isn t that all these teenage girls are infected with stds it s that the new york times is using the word infected to describe their infections _meta_end_dot_

 next up is this unintentionally ironic passage we by which i mean feminists have known for while that young women were at a high risk of hpv but no one wants to listen when it is preventative _meta_end_dot_

 no instead they want to cut funding for sex ed programs and teach children to abstain _meta_end_dot_

 sorry to generalize there but you get my point first off given these statistics i think it s time to declare that our sex ed programs are complete and utter failures _meta_end_dot_

 moreover go ahead and poke fun at the abstinence programs but the teenagers who abstained aren t the ones with the stds _meta_end_dot_

 last but not least the post closes with this why is the burden and spotlight only on young women _meta_end_question_

 what are young men doing that is leading to high risk behaviors and leading to young women being infected i think it is important to look at the risks for young women and educate and spread resources accordingly but it is very short sighted to assume this is a problem only for young women _meta_end_dot_

 yes because there s not a corresponding study being published in the nyt pointing out how many teenage guys are infected with stds some sort of horrible gender bias must be involved that will lead people to mistakenly believe that men had nothing to do with this _meta_end_dot_

 and thus as you can now see courtesy of feministing what seemed like a straightforward post about the shocking number of teenage girls who have stds is really nothing more than a propaganda piece by the patriarchy that s designed to ruin everybody s good time by shaming sluts while simultaneously convincing the public that teenage girls are getting infected with stds by themselves without the help of teenage guys and they would have gotten away with it too if it wasn t for those meddling feminists _meta_end_exclamation_

 hat tip goes to my buddy cassy fiano who pointed this post out to me last night _meta_end_dot_
