  a triple shot of weird from the new york times _meta_end_dot_

 let s start with obama has many ties to fannie mae aig lobbyists and domestic terrorists huh _meta_end_question_

 oh sorry mccain and team have many ties to gambling industry senator john mccain was on a roll _meta_end_dot_

 in a room reserved for high stakes gamblers at the foxwoods resort casino in connecticut he tossed _meta_dollor_ref_ chips around a hot craps table _meta_end_dot_

 when the marathon session ended around _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ a m the arizona senator and his entourage emerged with thousands of dollars in winnings _meta_end_dot_

 as a two time chairman of the indian affairs committee mr _meta_end_dot_

 mccain has done more than any other member of congress to shape the laws governing america s casinos helping to transform the once sleepy indian gambling business into a _meta_dollor_ref_ billion a year behemoth with _meta_number_ref_ casinos across the country _meta_end_dot_

 he has won praise as a champion of economic development and self governance on reservations _meta_end_dot_

 as factions of the ferociously competitive gambling industry have vied for an edge they have found it advantageous to cultivate a relationship with mr _meta_end_dot_

 mccain or hire someone who has one according to an examination based on more than _meta_number_ref_ interviews and thousands of pages of documents _meta_end_dot_

 mr _meta_end_dot_

 mccain portrays himself as a washington maverick unswayed by special interests referring recently to lobbyists as birds of prey yet in his current campaign more than _meta_number_ref_ fund raisers and top advisers have lobbied or worked for an array of gambling interests including tribal and las vegas casinos lottery companies and online poker purveyors _meta_end_dot_

 a nicely written article by the times with a mix of look at the good mccain has done for these indians and hmm he sure seems like he does quite a bit with lobbyists and to increase gambling in this country which is bad a long long long page a_meta_number_ref_ article _meta_end_dot_

 why _meta_end_question_

 what is the point other then to subtely paint mccain as a gambling addict hell bent on taking lobbyist money to make american s into gamblers _meta_end_dot_

 massachusetts proposal would repeal income tax amid the whirlwind presidential election massachusetts has a ballot contest of its own this november that could drastically alter some would say cripple state government _meta_end_dot_

 at issue is question _meta_number_ref_ which would eliminate the state income tax _meta_end_dot_

 it would save the average taxpayer about _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ a year _meta_end_dot_

 annual revenue from the tax is about _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ billion roughly _meta_number_ref_ percent of the state s budget of about _meta_dollor_ref_ billion _meta_end_dot_

 let s see the state with two of the most liberal senators one a failed presidential candidate who liked to talk about tax cuts for the rich and the other the lion of the senate who never met a tax increase he didn t like wants to eliminate the state income tax _meta_end_dot_

 this is a state with _meta_number_ref_ house seats and all ten are democrats _meta_end_dot_

 massively liberal progressive _meta_end_dot_

 if they think this is a good idea maybe the rest of the country should consider it _meta_end_dot_

 and last but not least but certainly most insane the grey lady editorial board the sense of the entire paper goes nutroots electronic voting machines are notoriously unreliable but their defenders insist that they can be trusted because they are rigorously tested before they are certified for use _meta_end_dot_

 now congressional investigators have issued a report confirming that the federal certification program needs work _meta_end_dot_

 the election assistance commission says it wants to do better _meta_end_dot_

 congress should monitor its progress and make sure that the certification system is strengthened _meta_end_dot_

 still the best way to ensure the integrity of the vote is for congress to require voter verified paper records for every electronic ballot cast _meta_end_dot_

 in other words watch out for those wascally republicans who are going to attempt to steal the vote for a _meta_number_ref_rd straight presidential election _meta_end_dot_

 maybe they should be looking at their own side first _meta_end_dot_
