  the fundamentalist church of jesus christ of latter day saints case has been a mess from the beginning _meta_end_dot_

 and yes the government raiding on flimsy evidence was troubling _meta_end_dot_

 with that being said something rotten is going on with this polygamist group _meta_end_dot_

 the case is ongoing the grand jury returned the indictments after meeting for more than seven hours and hearing from at least eight witnesses including seven young sect women and willie jessop a spokesman for the group _meta_end_dot_

 standing outside the courthouse after appearing before the grand jury jessop called the testimony a very painful process he said the group would mount a vigorous defense for all those charged _meta_end_dot_

 a source close to the group said prosecutors were getting no help from any of the members called as witnesses _meta_end_dot_

 to every question asked the source said everybody is taking the fifth that legal strategy refusing to answer questions so as to not incriminate oneself was also being used by girls the possible victims who testified today and at previous two proceedings the source said _meta_end_dot_

 the tactic was infuriating prosecutors stated the source who spoke on condition of anonymity because grand jury proceedings are supposed to be secret _meta_end_dot_

 the charges handed down today may not be the last against members of the fundamentalist church of jesus christ of latter day saints _meta_end_dot_

 documents seized during a raid on the group s yearning for zion ranch last spring and introduced as part of a separate custody hearing link _meta_number_ref_ men to unions with minor girls _meta_end_dot_

 last month s indictment did not include those men _meta_end_dot_

 these guys are pedophiles _meta_end_dot_

 their wives are enablers _meta_end_dot_

 their children are brainwashed _meta_end_dot_

 ugh _meta_end_dot_

 let this crap happen in some third world muslim nation it s vile enough there but not in america _meta_end_dot_

 i hope the prosecutors have enough solid evidence that the girls don t need to testify _meta_end_dot_

 they won t get the truth from the girls _meta_end_dot_

 they are programmed to serve the men _meta_end_dot_

 and what if the men don t get convicted _meta_end_question_

 the girls have the pleasure of spending their lives in subservience to these guys _meta_end_dot_
