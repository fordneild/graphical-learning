  going into florida i wrote that mccain s dream scenario was as follows mccain stokes his momentum for super tuesday by defeating romney giuliani drops out and his supporters start moving over to mccain and huckabee stays in to drain off southern conservatives from mitt on super tuesday unfortunately for the other candidates in the race that s exactly how it played out although it remains to be seen what percentage of rudy s supporters will migrate to the mccain camp _meta_end_dot_

 so how will things be looking after super tuesday next week _meta_end_question_

 here s jim geraghty s prediction of how it will look after super tuesday which has mccain doing a little worse than some of the other estimates i ve seen because of the lack of polling in some of these states and the complicated way delegates are handed out this is very difficult to estimate _meta_end_dot_

 in the romney pile we ll probably have about five to seven wins and the delegates most of massachusetts all of utah all of montana most of colorado all of missouri and if that poll is correct all of delaware and perhaps most of north dakota s _meta_end_dot_

 and he ll get some of california s _meta_end_dot_

 i put him at about _meta_number_ref_ to _meta_number_ref_ delegates _meta_end_dot_

 in the huckabee pile we ll have alabama arkansas tennessee georgia and maybe he ll get some of california s _meta_end_dot_

 i put him around _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 in the mccain pile we ll have all of arizona all of new york all of new jersey all of connecticut probably the largest chunk of california s probably most of minnesota s probably majorities in oklahoma and west virginia _meta_end_dot_

 i put him around somewhere north of _meta_number_ref_ delegates _meta_end_dot_

 alaska may go for ron paul and he may get a majority of their _meta_number_ref_ delegates _meta_end_dot_

 that would put things at about mccain at _meta_number_ref_ needing _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ to be the nominee romney at _meta_number_ref_ huckabee at _meta_number_ref_ or so _meta_end_dot_

 so let s say it plays out about like that what happens next _meta_end_question_

 well mccain who is already being treated in some quarters as if he has the nomination locked up will get another big boost as he moves way ahead in the delegate count _meta_end_dot_

 then the next key question will be whether romney or huckabee will drop out _meta_end_dot_

 if huckabee doesn t drop out it s hard to see how mitt will be able to make up the gap _meta_end_dot_

 if he does mitt should probably see what the polls look like and then make a call about whether to continue _meta_end_dot_

 however ominously _meta_end_dot_

 several officials said that on the heels of a defeat in tuesday s florida primary romney s campaign was not attempting to purchase television advertising time in any of the states on the super tuesday calendar _meta_end_dot_

 that s a strong indication of two things _meta_number_ref_ he s out of donated money _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ he s considering dropping out after super tuesday _meta_end_dot_

 otherwise he d be pouring his own money into advertising in key states right now _meta_end_dot_

 i know mitt has deep pockets but rich guys are rich because they don t throw their money away _meta_end_dot_

 in political campaigns when candidates that are self financing think they have an uphill struggle to win the wallet usually closes _meta_end_dot_

 if mitt were to drop out huck would probably take a look at the polls see if he has a chance without romney in the race and then soldier on or call it quits depending on what it looked like _meta_end_dot_

 however huck s nearly broke too and at this point it s hard to see how he could raise the money he needs to keep competing against mccain after coming out of super tuesday in third place _meta_end_dot_

 so unless something changes get ready to start saying it _meta_end_dot_

 republican nominee john mccain _meta_end_dot_
