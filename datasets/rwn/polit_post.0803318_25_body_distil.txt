  with the seemingly never ending primary season soon drawing to a close something rather unexpected has happened _meta_end_dot_

 talk radio hosts like glenn beck and rush limbaugh usually the standard bearers of right wing thinking have been getting flak from what used to be their stalwart political constituencies over their criticism of john mccain and other candidates like mike huckabee who now appears to be the inevitable gop nominee _meta_end_dot_

 this is a bizarre turn of events to say the least especially given how people like limbaugh have been portrayed in the past by the left and their mouthpieces in the media _meta_end_dot_

 for years we have been told that limbaugh and his colleagues are little more than partisan plants who get their marching orders from gop headquarters _meta_end_dot_

 yet now it s pretty clear that limbaugh etc _meta_end_dot_

 don t necessarily carry the gop s water _meta_end_dot_

 or at least they re not carrying it this election season _meta_end_dot_

 and many on the right are not happy about that _meta_end_dot_

 but what i can t figure out is why they re unhappy about it _meta_end_dot_

 i can understand not wanting to see one s preferred candidate criticized but shouldn t we prefer honesty and forthrightness from our political commentators and not blind partisanship _meta_end_question_

 i for one am happy to see that someone who i have listened to and respected for years i m a rush baby is putting principle before party loyalty _meta_end_dot_

 and let s not forget that in the case of limbaugh specifically we re not talking about side taking _meta_end_dot_

 rush has been critical of john mccain for years now _meta_end_dot_

 anyone who listens to rush s show on any sort of a regular basis knows that mccain is routinely a target of criticism _meta_end_dot_

 given that reality is it reasonable to expect rush to do a _meta_number_ref_ on mccain and support him now that he s the gop s inevitable nominee _meta_end_question_

 it s reasonable i think if your expectations of political commentators lay along the lines of blind party loyalty instead of principle and honesty _meta_end_dot_
