  david bernstein notes the effect of the obama tax plan would be to raise marginal tax rates above _meta_percent_ref_ and in some states it could be as high as _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 obama is playing to his liberal type by exploiting the politics of envy to try and soak the rich but in terms of actual policy to do so would be economic suicide _meta_end_dot_

 it would encourage people to either a work less and be less productive or b shield their assets from taxation _meta_end_dot_

 or perhaps a combination of the two the fact is that _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ is hardly filthy rich these days _meta_end_dot_

 the people that obama will hurt with this punitive taxation will be the small business owners that employ _meta_percent_ref_ of the american workforce _meta_end_dot_

 they will be less inclined to grow their businesses and less inclined to hire new workers because the marginal utility of the extra work just went down dramatically _meta_end_dot_

 if the benefit of working _meta_percent_ref_ harder is a _meta_percent_ref_ increase in income after uncle sam takes his bite it makes little sense to work harder _meta_end_dot_

 because of that we lose the benefits of that extra labor _meta_end_dot_

 the bottom line is this it will become much more difficult for people in the middle class to move up the socioeconomic ladder _meta_end_dot_

 for warren buffet or bill gates an army of lawyers and accountants can shield income while the boss pats themselves on the back for their social responsibility for the average owner of a small flower shop or coffee house who can t afford those kind of tax shelters it means that moving to that next level is more of a curse than a blessing _meta_end_dot_

 for an economy that is based on the promise of upward mobility such punitive taxation is anathema _meta_end_dot_

 obama s plans make no economic sense _meta_end_dot_

 instead of shoring up entitlements he would dramatically expand them _meta_end_dot_

 for all of the talk about how mccain is a clone of bush obama seems to want to take the worst policy ideas of the bush administration medicare part d steel tariffs more government spending and do more of it _meta_end_dot_

 obama is running as a doctrinaire michael dukakis style tax and spend liberal _meta_end_dot_

 even though this is unquestionably a democratic year a lot of voters will be smart enough to see that sen _meta_end_dot_

 obama seems to want to punish those with the audacity to hope to build themselves up economically _meta_end_dot_
