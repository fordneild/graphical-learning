  i don t know if you re aware of this but some conservatives have a problem with john mccain _meta_end_dot_

 it s not just that he goes against conservatives on some big issues that he seems to act like the only reason we d disagree with him on those issues is because we re too stupid to see him for the straight talking god among men he is _meta_end_dot_

 this means he s going to have some major work to do at cpac to get conservative support _meta_end_dot_

 luckily i frank j am still a party man and have some advice for the presumptive republican nominee _meta_end_dot_

 being the true conservative he is i m sure he s reading right wing news so i ll address these directly to him _meta_end_dot_

 frank advice for mccain at cpac one word yubitsume _meta_end_dot_

 it s a japanese ritual of cutting off a part of your pinky finger in an act of apology _meta_end_dot_

 will seem sincere _meta_end_dot_

 punch mike huckabee in the nuts _meta_end_dot_

 it s just like schoolyard rules if you re getting picked on pick on the even more hated kid to deflect _meta_end_dot_

 so if people are calling you a rino start bashing the even bigger rino _meta_end_dot_

 should work like a charm though it may cause more troubles with evangelicals _meta_end_dot_

 resist urge to urinate on the crowd _meta_end_dot_

 standing above so many conservatives i know it will be hard for you to not just unzip your fly and piss all over them but you ll have to try _meta_end_dot_

 it may seem right and natural to you do so but it won t go over well _meta_end_dot_

 kill a mexican drug smuggler _meta_end_dot_

 this one would have needed some prep time but it would be nice to demonstrate you re serious about the border by videotaping you coldly killing a mexican drug smuggler trying to sneak across the border _meta_end_dot_

 bonus points for mailing the body back the mexican government postage due does mexico have a functional government _meta_end_dot_

 call for a bombing run on berkeley until they admit the military is awesome _meta_end_dot_

 conservatives would like a nice local war _meta_end_dot_

 plus if in the end we decide to pull out of berkeley and never go back that s cool too _meta_end_dot_

 hand out free candy _meta_end_dot_

 pretty self explanatory _meta_end_dot_

 conservatives will say mccain may be against us on many issues but he s the only candidate who gave me candy declare you will fund the creation of a giant robot to fight for america s interests _meta_end_dot_

 i m not quite sure how that s a conservative issue but it seems like one _meta_end_dot_

 btw the robot should have red glowing eyes _meta_end_dot_

 vow to create more global warming _meta_end_dot_

 see here s a great compromise _meta_end_dot_

 you believe in man made global warming but that doesn t mean you have to take a liberal position on it _meta_end_dot_

 say warming is awesome and call for more of it _meta_end_dot_

 it will be an especially popular position this winter _meta_end_dot_

 state that fred thompson will be your vp and vow not to live long _meta_end_dot_

 that would be awesome _meta_end_dot_

 i bet it would get a standing ovation at cpac _meta_end_dot_

 if all else fails dance a happy little jig _meta_end_dot_

 it s hard to be mad at someone who is dancing a happy little jig _meta_end_dot_

 this technique has gotten me out of a lot of trouble _meta_end_dot_
