  my latest column at townhall is called how the bradley effect blew up the new hampshire polling _meta_end_dot_

 here s an excerpt from the column what s the bradley effect _meta_end_question_

 the general idea is that whites lie to pollsters and falsely claim that they re undecided or voting for a black candidate because they re afraid that they ll be thought of as racists if they tell the truth _meta_end_dot_

 the effect is named for tom bradley but it has also appeared in high profile races featuring harvey gantt and doug wilder both of whom produced results at the ballot box that were too far apart from the polling data to explain with conventional wisdom _meta_end_dot_

 one thing that people seem to misunderstand about the bradley effect is that it s not about racism per se _meta_end_dot_

 people aren t lying to pollsters because they re racists they re lying to pollsters because they fear that they will be labeled as racists _meta_end_dot_

 that s not the same thing although you wouldn t know it from some of the liberal commentary on the bradley effect _meta_end_dot_

 you can read it all here _meta_end_dot_
