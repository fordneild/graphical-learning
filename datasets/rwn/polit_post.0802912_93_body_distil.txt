  after fred dropped out mitt romney got a very nice bounce in his national numbers and his florida numbers _meta_end_dot_

 currently according to rasmussen mitt is now ahead of mccain nationally _meta_percent_ref_ to _meta_percent_ref_ and in florida mitt came from being a few points behind mccain to running neck and neck with him in the latest polls _meta_end_dot_

 couple that with the fact that the conservative media is ceaselessly hammering away at mccain now that huckabee seems to have dropped back and mitt would appear to be in pretty good shape going into super tuesday _meta_end_dot_

 however things are actually more perilous than they would seem for mitt for two reasons _meta_end_dot_

 the biggest of them is that rudy giuliani bet his entire campaign on winning florida and if he loses which he almost surely will he very well may drop out of the race _meta_end_dot_

 if that happens well let s see he s a moderate fiscally conservative candidate who is strong on national security issues and primarily appeals to middle of the road voters hmmmm which of the remaining candidates does that sound like _meta_end_question_

 my guess is that if rudy giuliani drops out mccain will get as much of a boost from him as mitt got from fred leaving the race _meta_end_dot_

 then the other factor is mike huckabee _meta_end_dot_

 if he stays in the race through super tuesday and it is looking like he will he will do especially well in conservative southern states where romney will need to clean up delegates to stay competitive with mccain _meta_end_dot_

 in other words if super tuesday ends up being john mccain vs _meta_end_dot_

 mitt romney vs _meta_end_dot_

 mike huckabee mccain probably wins that fight and comes out of it with the most delegates _meta_end_dot_

 that may be the most likely scenario and it s one that wouldn t be good for mitt romney _meta_end_dot_

 however there is many a slip betwixt a cup and a lip _meta_end_dot_

 if giuliani stays in he would play the john edwards role in the democratic race except he d be draining support from john mccain instead of barack obama _meta_end_dot_

 then there s huckabee _meta_end_dot_

 if he drops out it s difficult to know exactly where his support would end up _meta_end_dot_

 then there s the possibility that mitt could win florida and get some momentum going while talk radio beats down mccain more than expected _meta_end_dot_

 so both mitt and mccain are definitely in the thick of the race _meta_end_dot_

 that being said to sum it all up whether mccain or mitt wins florida the person most likely to benefit is mccain _meta_end_dot_

 that s because rudy will probably be knocked out of the race and guiliani s supporters will probably tend to gravitate towards johnny mac _meta_end_dot_
