  all of us on the right new it already have known it for decades _meta_end_dot_

 the liberal progressive surrender monkey way of life is the same as that of animals _meta_end_dot_

 hopefully prey animals ny times as they traveled across indiana and north carolina over the last few days trading charges and countercharges about the wisdom of suspending the federal gas tax for the summer senators hillary rodham clinton and barack obama were really having a larger fight _meta_end_dot_

 they were arguing over who had better economic instincts _meta_end_dot_

 then we have lemmings which will follow each other off a cliff _meta_end_dot_

 or thomson s gazelle who follow each other into the mara river at a certain time and place and many become crocodile chow _meta_end_dot_

 that is a bad instinct _meta_end_dot_

 the last thing i want is to listen to the instincts of democrats who think taking money away from productive members of society and giving it to parasites is a good idea _meta_end_dot_

 who feel we should seriously destroy the economy to save us from global warming _meta_end_dot_

 who s instincts lead them to believe that raising taxes will stimulate the economy rather then allowing people to spend their own hard earned money _meta_end_dot_

 i d prefer a politician who thought about an issue more then trusted their gut feelings _meta_end_dot_

 people who weren t equating themselves to animals and instead to well people _meta_end_dot_
