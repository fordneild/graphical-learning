  hillary negotiated nothing and was present at no major meetings on foreign policy and national security after _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 she reviewed some presidential speeches including the one announcing the bombing of terrorist camps crafted in an awkward husband and wife session on martha s vineyard just after president clinton confessed to the monica lewinsky scandal in _meta_number_ref_ gave an important address at a beijing conference on women and traveled to _meta_number_ref_ countries as a good will ambassador _meta_end_dot_

 but these contributions are more reminiscent of eleanor roosevelt than say al gore _meta_end_dot_

 on domestic policy hillary was essentially sidelined after her disastrous _meta_number_ref_ health care plan _meta_end_dot_

 the state children s health insurance program she touts was actually something the clinton administration stalled on until pressured by ted kennedy and dodd who also led the seven year fight for the family and medical leave act _meta_end_dot_

 the clinton crime bill that included _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ new cops was biden s legislation and bob rubin while now endorsing hillary grumbled about her judgment and never let her in on economic policy when he was treasury secretary _meta_end_dot_

 clinton was still the most influential first lady in history and she has a lot more familiarity with the upper reaches of government than obama _meta_end_dot_

 but if her inevitability is destroyed in iowa her experience might not be much help liberal johnathan alter in newsweek
