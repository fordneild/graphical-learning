  i didn t write this one so i won t do a full crosspost from staclu on it _meta_end_dot_

 warner todd huston did a great job covering this earlier so i won t post all the details again but i wanted to share a portion of my post illustrating the emotion that is liberalism no brains _meta_end_dot_

 wanna see what i mean _meta_end_question_

 people for the american way one more bush justice on the court and the decision would likely have gone the other way _meta_end_dot_

 that s why it s so important for americans to realize that in this election year the supreme court is on the ballot _meta_end_dot_

 john mccain has already promised the gop that he would nominate justices to the court exactly like those bush has brought to the bench _meta_end_dot_

 this year we must reverse the tide and begin to restore a supreme court that upholds our individual rights and the laws that keep us free _meta_end_dot_

 emphasis added our rights they keep america free _meta_end_dot_

 not unlawful enemy combatant terrorists _meta_end_dot_

 how much evidence and common sense is it going to take to get through the emotion of liberals _meta_end_question_

 lean left foreigners in this country are entitiled sic to the same rights and protections as us citizens when charged with a crime _meta_end_dot_

 it is ludicrous to believe that should change on either just the executive s say so or becasue sic of the location of the prison _meta_end_dot_

 someone held by the federal government is held by the federal government whether they are in alabama gitmo or the moon _meta_end_dot_

 if these people are prisoners of war then treat them as such _meta_end_dot_

 if they are not then they are criminals and should be treated the same as every other criminal in the care of the federal government _meta_end_dot_

 inventing a third class of people that the executive gets to do with as they please cannot be an option under our constitution _meta_end_dot_

 these people are not prisoners of war and they certainly cannot be upgraded to criminal status _meta_end_dot_

 criminals are citizens who break the law and are provided certain rights _meta_end_dot_

 a pow is a lawful enemy combatant _meta_end_dot_

 a terrorist is an unlawful enemy combatant _meta_end_dot_

 we didn t invent this third class of people _meta_end_dot_

 they invented it themselves on _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 all emotion no brains _meta_end_dot_

 that s enough for now _meta_end_dot_

 it makes me tired _meta_end_dot_

 so it goes for the life of a patriot _meta_end_dot_

 read the rest _meta_end_dot_
