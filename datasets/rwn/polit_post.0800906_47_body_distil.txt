  new hampshire was supposed to be a strong state for ron paul _meta_end_dot_

 in fact there was one poll last week that had him finishing in the _meta_number_ref_ slot with _meta_percent_ref_ of the vote _meta_end_dot_

 but in the end he ended up in _meta_number_ref_th _meta_end_dot_

 so for curiousity s sake i decided to head over to the daily paul forums to see how his diehard fans have been taking the news that the rest of the country doesn t share their enthusiasm for ron paul _meta_end_dot_

 as you can imagine it wasn t pretty _meta_end_dot_

 there were several threads claiming the election in new hampshire was rigged even though ron paul finished where most of the polls ultimately predicted that he would in _meta_number_ref_th place _meta_end_dot_

 here s one of my favorite fraud posts john mccain knew he was going to win _meta_end_exclamation_

 i have read the book votescam which i reccomend to all of you _meta_end_dot_

 hard to find and banned by barnes noble back in the _meta_number_ref_s _meta_end_dot_

 solid evidence sinificant mass vote fraud has existed since the early _meta_number_ref_s _meta_end_dot_

 new hampshire was a rigged election _meta_end_dot_

 mccain knew in advance he was going to win _meta_end_dot_

 watch the abc debate compared to all the rest _meta_end_dot_

 the others he looks afraid _meta_end_dot_

 in the recent abc debate he has this smile on his face as if he knows he s going to win _meta_end_dot_

 he should have been afraid of losing to romney being right beside massachusettes and the amount of money romney spent _meta_end_dot_

 if you notice mccain s behavior in the media in general the past couple of days he has this same look on his face like haha im going to win and there s nothing you can do about it _meta_end_dot_

 then they called it on all the media networks after like _meta_percent_ref_ had voted _meta_end_dot_

 scary and sad _meta_end_dot_

 there are plenty of other posts along those lines but they don t quite compare to this thread that features ron paul fans talking about what country they re going to move to if ron paul doesn t win the presidency _meta_end_dot_

 here are a few of the more noteworthy posts from that thread this may sound a little strange but _meta_end_dot_

 there may come a time in the future where you decide to leave _meta_end_dot_

 i would suggest australia or new zeeland i hope i did not mis spell there are other better countries now _meta_end_dot_

 but in the event of a larger war _meta_end_dot_

 those countries are not likely to be targeted by nuclear weapons and are english speaking countries _meta_end_dot_

 eventually yes no place may be safe but seriously there will come a time when you will not be able to leave the usa and that is the truth _meta_end_dot_

 i used to be a nationalistic patriotic person _meta_end_dot_

 once i learned the truth about alot of things i have a different outlook or its leaders _meta_end_dot_

 i was born a citizen of the usa but as far as i can tell the nwo will never give up their evil dream they are insane but _meta_end_dot_

 i hope there can be a different outcome however once i learned the and i suggest you do the same _meta_end_dot_

 i hope rp does well during the rest hey all you pipe dreams _meta_end_exclamation_

 hey all you pipe dreams that are only dreaming about leaving _meta_end_dot_

 did our forefathers pack up and run _meta_end_question_

 no _meta_end_exclamation_

 they stayed and stood and fought _meta_end_exclamation_

 stop dreaming fools _meta_end_exclamation_

 the fight is here and now _meta_end_exclamation_

 you can not run from the new world order _meta_end_dot_

 they will evenbtually say that terrorist cells exist wherever and they will spread fear there _meta_end_exclamation_

 be it new zealand austrailia estonia costa rica it doesdn t matter _meta_end_exclamation_

 you better wake up because you are not going anywhere _meta_end_exclamation_

 costa rica great place to live and great place to prosper _meta_beep_ref_ _meta_end_exclamation_

 not saying that anyone needs to move here but i did _meta_number_ref_ years ago and it has been the best years of my life _meta_end_dot_

 no military means true peace _meta_end_dot_

 i aint leaving i am staying right here _meta_end_dot_

 i might go join with the lakota sioux indians for their free independance from the us government _meta_end_dot_

 when it comes down to it gorbachev said he would recognize them as an independant nation _meta_end_dot_

 no taxes and very little laws _meta_end_dot_

 everyone is welcome to join them _meta_end_dot_

 i wont turn tail and run i would rather die on my feet than live on my knees _meta_end_dot_

 will stay here _meta_end_dot_

 i ll stay here and get my year s supply in order generators fuel precious metals in storage and plenty of guns and ammo to go around _meta_end_dot_

 everybody on this forum knows it if we pick ourselves up from here trudge on and months from now a brokered convention yields nothing this country is in for rough times obama edwards julie annie romney or the traitor mccain they re all cut from the same cloth and american will be the one that takes it up the rear _meta_end_dot_

 better stock up on your canned goods and ammo kiddies _meta_end_dot_

 new zealand _meta_end_question_

 canada will go right with the north american union so can t go there _meta_end_dot_

 gradually all countries in the eu will be facist with influence of us multinational companies _meta_end_dot_

 you probably read about rupert murdock buying up german tv today _meta_end_dot_

 africa will obviously be horrible since they are where we get our minerals from and us companies need the cheap labor _meta_end_dot_

 so that really leaves austalia and new zealand _meta_end_dot_

 i like these places because there is no strategic launch point to this continent _meta_end_dot_

 they have no huge oil reserves _meta_end_dot_

 we take over a state when n a u _meta_end_dot_

 starts to take place we secede from union have the dr _meta_end_dot_

 as president _meta_end_dot_

 i vote for florida great wheather natural resources agriculture livestock we already have a complete we already have a complete exit strategy to ecuador _meta_end_dot_

 ok i ve got the plan _meta_end_exclamation_

 pykrete is a composite material made of approximately _meta_percent_ref_ sawdust and _meta_percent_ref_ water by weight then frozen _meta_end_dot_

 it has some interesting properties notably its relatively slow melting rate due to low thermal conductivity and its vastly improved strength and toughness over pure ice actually closer to concrete while still being able to float on water _meta_end_dot_

 pykrete is slightly harder to form than concrete as it expands while freezing but can be repaired and maintained from the sea s most abundant raw material _meta_end_dot_

 the plan is to build a massive floating iceberg of pykrete with refrigeration piping to keep it frozen like the design of the wwii aircraft carrier the habakkuk and build our own country free from central banks war and taxes _meta_end_dot_

 alright so i m crazy _meta_end_dot_

 so what _meta_end_dot_

 it would be easier to build that then change the political views of the stupid american people _meta_end_dot_

 cuba is where its at why do you think the u s _meta_end_dot_

 and a _meta_end_dot_

 does not want us to travel to cuba _meta_end_question_

 because its non illuminati controlled and we just might not want to come back _meta_end_dot_

 my friend lived there a few months and loved it _meta_end_dot_

 they roll out the red carpet for any americans since we are not allowed to go there according to the u s _meta_end_dot_

 and a _meta_end_dot_

 also they already went through their peak oil when the soviets pulled out _meta_end_dot_

 farmers make more than doctors or lawyers and people grow much of their own food and everybody has chickens _meta_end_dot_

 now thats freedom _meta_end_exclamation_

 we should pick a state and we should pick a state and secede from the union _meta_end_exclamation_

 or we could invade baja california and take it from mexico start our own nation _meta_end_dot_

 either way we can draft ron paul as our first president _meta_end_exclamation_
