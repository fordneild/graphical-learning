 in an effort to narrow down the list even further i posted a poll today on rightwingnews com to ask my readers there to vote for their favorite among those ten _meta_end_dot_

 more than _meta_number_ref_ people responded and the results didn t surprise me jindal was the most popular selection and palin was a close second _meta_end_dot_

 jim demint _meta_number_ref_ percent it s no surprise that a blog poll shows considerable support for demint in part because he was among the first politicians to embrace the technology and make new media a critical part of his communications _meta_end_dot_

 readers and writers of blogs alike recognize this and have long commended him for this _meta_end_dot_
