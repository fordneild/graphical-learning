  f or all its warts and carbuncles i d still not want to live anywhere else _meta_end_dot_

 that s because there s still a will in this great nation to do what is right _meta_end_dot_

 and while we may disagree on what that is and how to go about it that freedom to dissent to argue to rant and rave is more precious that you can imagine _meta_end_dot_

 never do i go to bed at night concerned there will be a knock on my door and i ll be taken away for something i ve said or written _meta_end_dot_

 i spent my youth in other countries as my father a career army officer did his job _meta_end_dot_

 i saw first hand what poverty really looks like _meta_end_dot_

 i got to see what the suppression of freedoms we take for granted entailed _meta_end_dot_

 i learned at an early age to appreciate what we have here and how important it is to work toward keeping us free _meta_end_dot_

 and certainly i have my concerns and take the opportunity on this blog to voice them _meta_end_dot_

 but again the simple act of doing that without fear is a blessing beyond reach for many in this world _meta_end_dot_

 there s an innate spirit that still lives in most americans and needs to be constantly nurtured that says we can and will overcome all obstacles in our path and do it while we continue to live free _meta_end_dot_

 there are those among us who cynically denigrate any appeals to patriotism and would have us believe that being patriotic is more like a disease than a matter of pride in one s country and its accomplishments _meta_end_dot_

 but the proof of their ignorance on the subject is found in the irony of their freedom to say such things without fear _meta_end_dot_

 i find that most people who can t muster pride in where they live and what it stands for have no pride in much of anything _meta_end_dot_

 i feel sorry for them _meta_end_dot_

 that said i ve never felt patriotism meant my country right or wrong _meta_end_dot_

 instead it meant trying to shorten that phrase to my country right and working very hard to make that happen _meta_end_dot_

 we re independent today because a group of patriots pledged their lives fortunes and sacred honor toward achieving a goal _meta_end_dot_

 it is and was a very noble goal _meta_end_dot_

 today s patriot needs to remember those original goals and ideals of our independence and renew the effort to keep them in the forefront of the political discussion _meta_end_dot_

 we are free today because of those ideals and goals and we should never forget that _meta_end_dot_

 have a very happy _meta_number_ref_th _meta_end_dot_
