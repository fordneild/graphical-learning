  and once again the news has nothing to do with embryonic stem cell research new york scientists have made ordinary human skin cells take on the chameleon like powers of embryonic stem cells a startling breakthrough that might someday deliver the medical payoffs of embryo cloning without the controversy _meta_end_dot_

 laboratory teams on two continents report success in a pair of landmark papers released tuesday _meta_end_dot_

 it s a neck and neck finish to a race that made headlines five months ago when scientists announced that the feat had been accomplished in mice _meta_end_dot_

 the direct reprogramming technique avoids the swarm of ethical political and practical obstacles that have stymied attempts to produce human stem cells by cloning embryos _meta_end_dot_

 scientists familiar with the work said scientific questions remain and that it s still important to pursue the cloning strategy but that the new work is a major coup _meta_end_dot_

 this work represents a tremendous scientific milestone the biological equivalent of the wright brothers first airplane said dr _meta_end_dot_

 robert lanza chief science officer of advanced cell technology which has been trying to extract stem cells from cloned human embryos _meta_end_dot_

 it s a bit like learning how to turn lead into gold said lanza while cautioning that the work is far from providing medical payoffs _meta_end_dot_

 it s a huge deal agreed rudolf jaenisch a prominent stem cell scientist at the whitehead institute in cambridge mass _meta_end_dot_

 you have the proof of principle that you can do it there is a catch _meta_end_dot_

 at this point the technique requires disrupting the dna of the skin cells which creates the potential for developing cancer _meta_end_dot_

 so it would be unacceptable for the most touted use of embryonic cells creating transplant tissue that in theory could be used to treat diseases like diabetes parkinson s and spinal cord injury _meta_end_dot_

 but the dna disruption is just a byproduct of the technique and experts said they believe it can be avoided _meta_end_dot_

 if embryonic stem cell research becomes a hot button issue for the elections next year like it did in _meta_number_ref_ where proponents of escr once again used outright lies into hoodwinking voters into supporting it i hope the republican candidates pound the hell out of all the breakthroughs that have been reported on the non embyronic stem cell front see here here here and here for examples and also repetitively mention the fact that to date there have been no cures developed on the embryonic stem cell research front _meta_end_dot_

 not a single one _meta_end_dot_

 yuval levin at nro writes about credit that should be given to the president on this issue this kind of outcome has been the hope behind president bush s stem cell policy _meta_end_dot_

 in fact the president spoke about this very same technique reprogramming skin cells in a speech back in july of _meta_number_ref_ and earlier this year signed an executive order to encourage this kind of work thomson s team in fact was supported by the nih _meta_end_dot_

 he should get credit for sticking to a crucial moral principle against immense and often quite irresponsible political pressure _meta_end_dot_

 the president has stuck to his principles on this issue and those principles are winning _meta_end_dot_

 wesley smith expands on the praise returning to president bush s stem cell funding policy even though it was politically unpopular the president believed wholeheartedly that the raw talent intelligence and creativity of the science sector would find a way to obtain pluripotent stem cells the ability to become any cell type through ethical means _meta_end_dot_

 in speeches and news conference answers about the stem cell issue bush repeatedly supported existing ethical areas of research and called upon researchers to find alternative methods of developing stem cell medicine without treating nascent human life as an experiment toward this end earlier this year bush signed an executive order requiring the nih to identify all sources of human pluripotent stem cells and invited scientists to work with the nih so we can add new ethically derived stem cell lines to the list of those eligible for federal funding i believe that many of these exciting alternative methods would not have been achieved but for president bush s stalwart stand promoting ethical stem cell research _meta_end_dot_

 indeed had the president followed the crowd instead of leading it most research efforts would have been devoted to trying to perfect escr and human cloning research which despite copious funding have not worked out yet as scientists originally hoped _meta_end_dot_

 so thank you for your courageous leadership mr _meta_end_dot_

 president _meta_end_dot_

 because of your willingness to absorb the brickbats of the science establishment the media elite and weak kneed republican and democratic politicians alike we now have the very real potential of developing thriving and robust stem cell medicine and scientific research sectors that will bridge rather than exacerbate our moral differences over the importance and meaning of human life _meta_end_dot_

 he also inserts a few well deserved digs at what he calls the scientific establishment and their pomposity _meta_end_dot_

 make sure to read the whole thing _meta_end_dot_

 i m sure the usual suspects who have slammed the president and other republicans repeatedly for being mean spirited regarding escr all by using disingenuous phoney arguments designed to appeal to emotion rather than reason will be lining up to sing his praises for not bowing to the political winds on the issue _meta_end_dot_

 i m also sure that i m next in line to be queen of england _meta_end_dot_

 happy thanksgiving everyone _meta_end_exclamation_
