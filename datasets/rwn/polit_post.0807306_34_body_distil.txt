  yesterday i ran an abortion poll on rwn _meta_end_dot_

 the question was as follows is there such a thing as men s rights when it comes to abortion here s how it broke out with just over _meta_number_ref_ responses no the father of the baby should have no say in whether a woman gets an abortion _meta_percent_ref_ yes the woman should not be able to have an abortion without the consent of the baby s father or a court order _meta_percent_ref_ this isn t just a rwn phenomenon either _meta_end_dot_

 over at wizbang they ran a similar poll _meta_end_dot_

 here are the results should men be able to halt an abortion if they want to keep the baby _meta_end_question_

 yes it s half his _meta_percent_ref_ no but he should be notified _meta_percent_ref_ no it isn t his body and it s misogyny to say he should be able to _meta_percent_ref_ i don t know it s too sticky a situation _meta_percent_ref_ i d like to see some more polling of the general population to see what they think about this but i think this could be a real opportunity for those of us who are pro life _meta_end_dot_

 let s say that we pushed laws that said a woman couldn t have an abortion without the signed approval of the father of her baby or a court order which is only fair _meta_end_dot_

 then if the woman had an abortion and a dna test proved that the father who signed off wasn t the right guy the woman would be hit with fraud charges and the real father could sue her for damages imagine how much of an impact that would have on the number of abortions in the country _meta_end_dot_

 it wouldn t put an end to abortion but it would help make them much more safe legal and rare which is what everyone says that they want right _meta_end_question_
