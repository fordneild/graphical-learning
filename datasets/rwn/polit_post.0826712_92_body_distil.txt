  late last week i was pleased to have the opportunity to interview the wall street journal s john fund about his book stealing elections revised and updated how voter fraud threatens our democracy with the election coming up in november it s a timely and important read _meta_end_dot_

 what follows is a very slightly edited transcript of our phone conversation _meta_end_dot_

 enjoy _meta_end_exclamation_

 here s something from your book that a lot of people may not know eight of the _meta_number_ref_ hijackers who attacked the world trade center and the pentagon had registered to vote how did that happen _meta_end_question_

 the motor voter act of _meta_number_ref_ which was the first piece of legislation that bill clinton signed into law mandated that states have to accept postcard voter registrations and also offer people applying for drivers licenses the chance to register to vote _meta_end_dot_

 several of the hijackers they registered to vote when they got drivers licenses and other false id _meta_end_dot_

 i have no evidence they voted but they were registered _meta_end_dot_

 they certainly could have voted _meta_end_dot_

 one group i keep seeing over and over in stories about election irregularities is acorn _meta_end_dot_

 can you briefly tell me about them and their connection to barack obama _meta_end_question_

 acorn is a fairly radical poverty rights public housing rights organization founded in the _meta_number_ref_ s and they do a lot of agitation on behalf of liberal and progressive causes _meta_end_dot_

 part of what they do is register voters and get out the vote _meta_end_dot_

 they have constant problems with the law _meta_end_dot_

 their employees in city after city from kansas city to st _meta_end_dot_

 louis to seattle have been indicted and convicted of registration fraud _meta_end_dot_

 they have a highly problematic record and barack obama was not only the chief trainer for their annual conferences he was their lawyer litigating cases in which election laws were weakened in the _meta_number_ref_ s in illinois _meta_end_dot_

 acorn s political arm has endorsed obama and obama has spoken at their national conference as recently as last year full of praise for them _meta_end_dot_

 ughh _meta_end_dot_

 there is a lot of concern out there from the general public particularly on the left about voter machines being rigged _meta_end_dot_

 has that happened anywhere to the best of your knowledge and how big of a concern is it _meta_end_question_

 there are two issues with electronic voting machines _meta_end_dot_

 the first issue is with some of the companies that are doing it on the cheap because they have low bid contracts and some of the software is questionable _meta_end_dot_

 so yes we have some kinks and that is unacceptable _meta_end_dot_

 but the conspiracy theories that the electronic voting machines are somehow manipulated by manchurian hackers behind some curtain who alter the election results that doesn t pan out _meta_end_dot_

 there is no better authority on that than joe andrew who was the chairman of the democratic national committee under bill clinton _meta_end_dot_

 he gave a speech a couple of years ago in which he said when it comes to electronic voting most liberals are just plain old fashioned nuts he said conservatives are interested in winning elections but that does not mean there is a vast right wing conspiracy trying to steal votes in america as the loudest voices on the left are saying today he went on to say conspiracy theories aren t good for democracy or the democratic party and it s unfortunate that they re leading democrats toward rallying behind the anti electronic vote bandwagon in a big election year because they think this movement is good for democrats then he went on to say any democrat who thinks that getting rid of direct electronic voting machines will help the democrats win is simply out to lunch so i think you have to distinguish between legitimate problems in which we have to make sure the machines work better and that there is a trail that can help insure public confidence in the system and conspiracy theories _meta_end_dot_

 one thing that is interesting from your book is that many americans think of mexico as being incredibly corrupt compared to the us however tell people a little bit about how their voting system stacks up to ours _meta_end_dot_

 you seem to imply that it s a better system than ours in a lot of ways and more honest _meta_end_dot_

 i don t imply _meta_end_dot_

 it is better _meta_end_dot_

 these countries have election systems that are far more secure than ours _meta_end_dot_

 to obtain voter credentials the citizen has to present a photo write a signature and give a thumb print _meta_end_dot_

 the voter card the citizen gets includes a picture with a hologram a magnetic strip a serial number to guard against tampering and then to cast a ballot voters have to present this card and then be certified by thumb print scanner _meta_end_dot_

 the system was designed because elections had so little credibility that they had to go to that to restore public confidence _meta_end_dot_

 the danger we have in our country is that although we have never had systems as corrupt as mexico s nationwide lack of confidence is increasing _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_percent_ref_ of americans according to polls i cite in my book really believe that either vote fraud or voter suppression and intimidation are serious problems that compromise election results _meta_end_dot_

 a related question are there illegal aliens voting in the u s _meta_end_question_

 any idea how many there may be _meta_end_question_

 since voting fraud is a felony it s not as if we re going to get them to announce that _meta_end_dot_

 but the problem is serious in some places and not so serious in others _meta_end_dot_

 there was a congressional investigation in california a decade ago that found that several hundred illegal aliens had probably voted in a congressional race that was very close although it didn t meet the burden of proof to overturn the election _meta_end_dot_

 certainly arizona has been very concerned with it _meta_end_dot_

 they ve asked people to prove their citizenship when registering to vote _meta_end_dot_

 i think it s a potential problem _meta_end_dot_

 i don t think it s a problem as big as the problem of absentee voting fraud simply because most illegal aliens don t want a lot of encounters with government officials _meta_end_dot_

 so most of them most of the time would not want to register and present a bigger target _meta_end_dot_

 however in concentrated areas south texas border counties california i think illegal aliens represent a problem in voting _meta_end_dot_

 for example the assassin of the mexican presidential candidate in the _meta_number_ref_s mr _meta_end_dot_

 colosio he was a long beach resident an illegal alien who had registered to vote three times _meta_end_dot_

 so it s a problem but not the most serious problem _meta_end_dot_

 simple question a lot of liberals have accused george bush of stealing both the _meta_number_ref_ and _meta_number_ref_ elections _meta_end_dot_

 is that true _meta_end_question_

 did it happen _meta_end_question_

 well let s look at the evidence _meta_end_dot_

 in _meta_number_ref_ a bunch of media organizations including the new york times the washington post and the associated press went through a recount _meta_end_dot_

 they found that if al gore had gotten the statewide recount that he wanted that george would have won in almost every conceivable scenario _meta_end_dot_

 the new york times report from nov _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ a comprehensive review of the uncounted florida ballots from last year s presidential election reveals that george w _meta_end_dot_

 bush would have won even if the united states supreme court had allowed the statewide manual recount of the votes that the florida supreme court had ordered to go forward usa today recount team _meta_end_dot_

 their conclusion who would have won if al gore had gotten the manual counts he requested in four counties answer george w _meta_end_dot_

 bush so these newspapers which aren t exactly bush partisans concluded bush won _meta_end_dot_

 in _meta_number_ref_ john kerry lost ohio and he lost the election _meta_end_dot_

 it s passing strange that some democrats continue to insist on the election being fraudulent _meta_end_dot_

 william crawford who s the african american chairman of the election board in columbus ohio says he s personally insulted at some of the accusations because he said look i want people in my community to vote _meta_end_dot_

 i did everything i could to get them to vote and make it easier for them to vote _meta_end_dot_

 there were some mistakes made but to say that this was some kind of conspiracy beggars the imagination _meta_end_dot_

 election boards in ohio are bipartisan _meta_end_dot_

 they re divided equally between democrats and republicans and most of the people making these accusations about the ohio election in _meta_number_ref_ were from out of state _meta_end_dot_

 the ones in state defend the process even if they lost the vote have there been elections for the senate or presidency stolen in u s _meta_end_dot_

 history _meta_end_question_

 can you tell us about some of them _meta_end_question_

 certainly _meta_end_dot_

 i think there are real questions about the _meta_number_ref_ louisiana senate election between mary landrieu and woody jenkins _meta_end_dot_

 i think there are serious questions about the shenanigans at the indian reservations in the race between democrat tim johnson and john thune in _meta_number_ref_ in south dakota _meta_end_dot_

 thune decided not to contest that election and he went on to beat tom daschle two years later _meta_end_dot_

 one of the reasons i think that thune won in _meta_number_ref_ was that there was much more ballot integrity and oversight on the indian reservations than there was in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 i think the most infamous case was the _meta_number_ref_ governor s race in washington _meta_end_dot_

 that highlighted a particular problem that you can have election laws that are so vague loosey goosey and lack so much detail that you can end up having a confused situation in which you can t tell where incompetence ends and the fraud begins _meta_end_dot_

 if you have a state that doesn t have a long tradition of accurate honest and competent election administration you can end up with a situation as in washington state where they found new ballots _meta_number_ref_ times during the recount _meta_end_dot_

 it s almost impossible to conceive of discovering ballots _meta_number_ref_ times in a single recount but they did _meta_end_dot_

 basically the election officials said we re not doing our jobs very well but it s not purposeful _meta_end_dot_

 we will never know what happened in washington state but the majority of the state s voters believe the wrong candidate was seated as governor _meta_end_dot_

 at the presidential level have we ever had a presidential election decided by fraud _meta_end_question_

 i think the _meta_number_ref_ election _meta_end_dot_

 you can go to seymour hersh s book on the kennedy family and he makes a compelling case that both texas and chicago where mayor daley blatantly bent the rules to increase the vote total for john f _meta_end_dot_

 kennedy both in illinois and texas there may have been enough vote fraud to swing the election to john f _meta_end_dot_

 kennedy _meta_end_dot_

 since then i think that most elections haven t been so close _meta_end_dot_

 the florida election is of course an exception because it was so close it was even within the random error margin in florida _meta_end_dot_

 but we re always one step away from another meltdown _meta_end_dot_

 larry sabato who is the director of the university of virginia s center for politics said that from voter fraud to election chicanery of all kinds america teeters on the edge of scandal every november _meta_end_dot_

 unless we do some of the things fund recommends sooner or later we re headed for more disasters as bad or worse than what we saw in florida in _meta_number_ref_ people who look at our system say it needs more work we haven t made nearly as much progress as we should have after florida and these new tactics methods and groups like acorn only complicate the problem and make a fair honest and competent count harder to achieve _meta_end_dot_

 last question here there seems to be a lot of emphasis in our political system on getting as many people to vote as humanly possible but shouldn t there be even more emphasis on making the system honest if we have to choose between the two of them _meta_end_question_

 there s a healthy tension between those goals _meta_end_dot_

 i think we can make it easy and simple for people to vote but we should also make sure they do so within the rule of law and follow the rules _meta_end_dot_

 there is a conflict of visions here as the economist thomas sowell would put it there are some people who believe that almost any increase in the people voting animates the ideals of democracy and the best election is the one with the highest turnout _meta_end_dot_

 there are some people who believe that in a stable democracy there are many people who are not fascinated or fixated on politics and low voter turnout can mean that some people feel the system is working well enough that they don t have to care that much _meta_end_dot_

 i think people should vote but i don t think the health of a democracy is defined by the number of people who participate _meta_end_dot_

 there are two civil rights here and that s what i would conclude with _meta_end_dot_

 we fought a great civil rights struggle in the sixties to make sure we got rid of poll taxes and other impediments to people voting and we should preserve and extend those gains _meta_end_dot_

 there is another civil right _meta_end_dot_

 each of your readers has a civil right not to have his vote cancelled out by someone who shouldn t be voting someone who is voting twice or someone who doesn t even exist _meta_end_dot_

 that s a civil right too _meta_end_dot_

 so you are absolutely right _meta_end_dot_

 we need to do both and i think the pendulum has swung so that there are a lot of people who believe we have the first problem _meta_number_ref_ years after the voting rights act but not the second one _meta_end_dot_

 i think we have to be vigilant about both _meta_end_dot_

 john i really appreciate your time _meta_end_exclamation_
