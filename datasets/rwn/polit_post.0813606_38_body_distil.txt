  back in late march i mentioned that my buddy skye from midnight blue was gratuitously assaulted by a peace protester _meta_end_dot_

 more chillingly last weekend a man attending a chester county peace movement ccpm peace vigil in west chester pennsylvania assaulted a citizen journalist and blogger _meta_end_dot_

 at _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ pm blogger skye was videotaping an exchange between opposing groups _meta_end_dot_

 as the conversation gets both animated and heated she shifts her filming position to capture all parties involved _meta_end_dot_

 the shot is abruptly cut when a fist flies at her face she is slapped and the camera is jammed into her face _meta_end_dot_

 not satisfied by the first blow he strikes her a second time _meta_end_dot_

 nearby police intervened and the party involved was quickly pointed out by the victim and witnesses _meta_end_dot_

 the officer requested the suspect s cooperation in the investigation _meta_end_dot_

 during his refusal this lover of peace took his physical abuse past shoving a woman and shoved the officer _meta_end_dot_

 he was rewarded with handcuffs and removal here s the video again try not to throw anything at the screen when the liberal thug attacks skye _meta_end_dot_

 well last night skye im d me to let me know that charges have been filed in the case meicht _meta_number_ref_ of west chester was charged with simple assault resisting arrest reap disorderly conduct and harassment _meta_end_dot_

 a prelim in his case is scheduled for friday at _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ cr _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 it s not entirely clear as to why both cases were filed in different courts though at least meicht will be in front of a judge who is probably sympathetic to his cause _meta_end_dot_

 personally i m rooting for the guy to go to the slammer but the judge who is probably sympathetic to his cause part doesn t give me a lot of confidence that justice will prevail _meta_end_dot_
