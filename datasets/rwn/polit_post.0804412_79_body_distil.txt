  but what if huckabee were able to win texas _meta_end_question_

 even then he still would not be able to amass enough delegates to beat mccain _meta_end_dot_

 in the last few days huckabee has conceded that he cannot reach the magic _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ delegate number he simply argues that mccain isn t there yet so the campaign should go on _meta_end_dot_

 last week the mccain camp was quite diplomatic and patient about huckabee s position _meta_end_dot_

 but last night campaign manager rick davis sent out a somewhat impatiently worded memo emphasizing just how impossible huckabee s situation is _meta_end_dot_

 the results from tonight s primary elections in virginia maryland and washington d c make it mathematically impossible for governor huckabee to secure the republican nomination for president davis wrote _meta_end_dot_

 he now needs _meta_number_ref_ delegates to secure the required _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 but in the remaining contests there are only _meta_number_ref_ delegates available _meta_end_dot_

 he would need to win _meta_number_ref_ percent of remaining delegates the corner
