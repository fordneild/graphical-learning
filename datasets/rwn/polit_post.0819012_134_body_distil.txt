  this recommended diary from the daily kos isn t the usual i am happy this republican died and is burning in hell or i can t wait for the revolution so i can murder republicans post from kos but yet and still it was such a brilliant window into the liberal mindset that i had to excerpt from it _meta_end_dot_

 you americans aren t selfish enough by lithiumcola you pay all these taxes but you don t want anything in return for it _meta_end_dot_

 you don t want free health care _meta_end_dot_

 you don t want time off of work _meta_end_dot_

 you don t want anything _meta_end_dot_

 you re not selfish enough _meta_end_dot_

 you get mad when someone is taking welfare and sitting on their ss _meta_end_dot_

 what have you got against sitting on your ss _meta_end_question_

 the whole point behind having a government and paying taxes is to have more time to sit on your ss _meta_end_dot_

 that s what technology is for _meta_end_dot_

 you americans work longer than anyone pay all these taxes make all these robots and then not only don t you sit on your ss but you get mad when anyone else does _meta_end_dot_

 you re f cking crazy _meta_end_dot_

 growing up means understanding self regard _meta_end_dot_

 and you got none _meta_end_dot_

 you think anything for you must be bad _meta_end_dot_

 you re like a kid whose hand has been slapped above the cookie jar _meta_end_dot_

 thing is you made the cookies idiot _meta_end_dot_

 this is your country your government and your taxes _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 you get to say what is done with it _meta_end_dot_

 and here s a clue you want to sit on your ss more _meta_end_dot_

 you want free health care _meta_end_dot_

 here s the whole post shortened to a sentence it s ok for everyone to be lazy and leech off of your fellow citizens of course the big problem with this is that it relies on the same misunderstanding of human nature that the communists have which isn t surprising since most liberals are commies at heart why do you think so many of them wear those che guevara shirts _meta_end_dot_

 the problem is drumroll please because this will be shocking to liberals people are not going to strive to achieve create new jobs and generally move the country forward if they re getting nothing out of it _meta_end_dot_

 now at this point the average liberal is scratching his head going move the country forward _meta_end_question_

 that post was about being lazy right _meta_end_dot_

 but who s going to pay the bills while everyone else is acting like leeches _meta_end_question_

 the reality is that today the average american citizen is not paying more in taxes than he is receiving in services _meta_end_dot_

 we make that up by looting the rich and running a deficit _meta_end_dot_

 but guess what _meta_end_question_

 we can t run a deficit forever and the rich are not going to keep working like little hamsters on wheels accumulating more tax dollars for the rest of us to use as the government takes an ever larger slice of their income _meta_end_dot_

 eventually at some point the corporations will go given the profits we pay after taxes it s not worth it for us to continue doing this and they ll drop part of their business or close up shop _meta_end_dot_

 eventually at some point the rich people will go given the amount of taxes i m paying on what i m earning it s not worth it for me to keep working _meta_end_dot_

 i might as well just lay back be lazy like everyone else and enjoy what i ve already earned the reality is that this country can t afford to pay for the government services it s handing out now _meta_end_dot_

 so the whole idea that we can receive even more while most of the country kicks back in a hammock and lets someone else do all the work is a fraud and it s a fraud at the heart of liberalism _meta_end_dot_
