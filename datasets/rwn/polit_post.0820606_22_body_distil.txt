  despite the conventional wisdom that emerging demographic trends would lead to the emergence of a democratic majority it appears that there s some good trends for the republicans _meta_end_dot_

 reyling on clark bensen s polidata apportionment estimates michael barone finds in a piece entitled demographic trends could make it harder for obama and democrats that several states are likely to gain house seats and thus electoral votes at the next reapportionment _meta_end_dot_

 bush _meta_number_ref_ states arizona _meta_number_ref_ georgia _meta_number_ref_ louisiana _meta_number_ref_ nevada _meta_number_ref_ ohio _meta_number_ref_ texas _meta_number_ref_ total _meta_number_ref_ kerry _meta_number_ref_ states california _meta_number_ref_ massachusetts _meta_number_ref_ minnesota _meta_number_ref_ new york _meta_number_ref_ pennsylvania _meta_number_ref_ total _meta_number_ref_ the upshot u nder the new electoral vote distribution bush s _meta_number_ref_ to _meta_number_ref_ electoral vote margin in _meta_number_ref_ becomes _meta_number_ref_ to _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 bush would have lost in _meta_number_ref_ if ohio had not gone his way under the projected post _meta_number_ref_ apportionment bush would have won _meta_number_ref_ to _meta_number_ref_ if ohio had not gone his way _meta_end_dot_

 maybe _meta_end_dot_

 we ll get to that shortly _meta_end_dot_

 but barone follows with this the demographic trends reflected in these projections would not prevent barack obama from being elected this year and re elected in _meta_number_ref_ but they would make it marginally more difficult _meta_end_dot_

 actually they wouldn t have any impact on this year at all _meta_end_dot_

 the census bureau constantly adjusts its data which impacts all manner of government allocations _meta_end_dot_

 it does not however result in reapportionment _meta_end_dot_

 that by constitutional mandate takes place only once a decade and impacts elections in years ending in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 as to the first part of barone s analysis it presumes ceteris paribus _meta_end_dot_

 but ceteris haven t paribused at all _meta_end_dot_

 arizona texas florida and georgia at least are becoming decidedly more hispanic and the carolinas and georgia are becoming more postindustrial and ideaopolis oriented _meta_end_dot_

 further virginia colorado and other states are becoming more purple for a variety of reasons _meta_end_dot_

 my guess is that texas which is projected to gain _meta_number_ref_ seats and california which is projected to lose _meta_number_ref_ will still be reliably republican and democratic respectively at the presidential level in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 but the number of electoral votes isn t the only thing that changes over the course of a decade _meta_end_dot_

 i certainly wouldn t consider all the states in either list above safe for mccain or obama _meta_end_dot_
