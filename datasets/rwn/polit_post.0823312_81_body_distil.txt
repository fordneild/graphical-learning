  a s it turns out the saddleback forum may turn out to be one of the most significant events in this election season he clashed with their leaders in his _meta_number_ref_ campaign _meta_end_dot_

 he struggled to gain their votes during the _meta_number_ref_ primaries _meta_end_dot_

 and he still doesn t spend much time talking about the issues they consider most important _meta_end_dot_

 but after saturday night s televised forum at the saddleback church in lake forest calif john mccain has taken an important step toward shoring up his support among the republican party s christian conservative base _meta_end_dot_

 even as speculation swirls that mccain could choose a running mate who supports abortion rights a move that would surely anger christian conservatives the presumptive republican nominee is enjoying a lift from his performance in last weekend s forum _meta_end_dot_

 so to the politics of all of this _meta_end_dot_

 of course now it remains important that he maintain that surge he s enjoying and like it or not for this election that means picking a vp candidate who shares the same abortion views as mccain does _meta_end_dot_

 that is a third rail issue for the voters he wooed saturday night and he can trash the bump if he selects a republican like ridge or especially if he was to pick joe lieberman _meta_end_dot_

 mccain finally has some momentum going _meta_end_dot_

 he has obama on the defensive he s hitting some good issues russia is cooperating in highlighting the importance of foreign policy and national security and he s gained visibility among conservatives with his showing at saddleback _meta_end_dot_

 his next move announcing his vp pick will tell everyone if he has figured all of this out and made a selection which will enhance his credibility and standing among a mostly unexcited base _meta_end_dot_

 if he goes with someone like ridge or lieberman its pretty much over _meta_end_dot_

 his campaign has announced that it won t be anyone who doesn t share his abortion views _meta_end_dot_

 he s also going to announce his pick on the _meta_number_ref_th in order to steal a little air from the dems _meta_end_dot_

 seems to me if true the mccain campaign is at least for the moment hitting on all cylinders _meta_end_dot_
