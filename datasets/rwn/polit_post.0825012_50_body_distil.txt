  tropical storm hanna blew through my neck of the woods last night and happily it turned out that it hit like john edwards _meta_end_dot_

 there were some small and medium sized branches down and a neighbor s picket fence blew over but there didn t seem to be any major damage _meta_end_dot_

 at the moment it has stopped raining the power s still on and the internet is still working _meta_end_dot_

 heck i have already done a radio interview early this morning and now i am going back to bed for a couple of hours _meta_end_dot_

 long story short all is well _meta_end_dot_

 good luck to the people still being hit up the coast _meta_end_dot_

 keep your head down and i said a little prayer for you this morning for whatever that s worth _meta_end_dot_
