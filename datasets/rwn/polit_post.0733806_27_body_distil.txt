  america s most influential blog is the daily kos _meta_end_dot_

 democratic members of congress post on the blog democratic presidential contenders cater to them and daily kos founder markos moulitsas is considered to be a mainstream figure amongst democrats _meta_end_dot_

 keep all of that in mind as you read these excerpts and quotes all of which come from the daily kos writers not from commenters on the blog _meta_number_ref_ i wrote a diary a short time ago about how the bush administration helped ruin my marriage _meta_end_dot_

 it wasn t because my husband was a bush supporter or anything it was because of all the stresses from job loses living without health insurance and getting sick to my husband being forced to take a job where he wasn t home much that helped ruin my marriage angrybird _meta_number_ref_ islamic countries can suck jesus s chocolate covered c_meta_beep_ref_ meanwhile over here in this part of never never land the catholic crazies are all freaked out over a chocolate jesus _meta_end_dot_

 so what_meta_beep_ref_ _meta_end_question_

 i just don t get it _meta_end_dot_

 i m being literal _meta_end_dot_

 i don t understand what s offensive about a chocolate jesus _meta_end_dot_

 maybe i didn t read the part of the bible that talks about not making graven images of the lord in chocolate and it s possible since the bible has so many other things that are institutionally nuts i wouldn t rule it out _meta_end_dot_

 why does anyone care that it s in chocolate _meta_end_question_

 the other part of this so called chocolate jesus controversy is his c ck _meta_end_dot_

 apparently he has one _meta_end_dot_

 someone hide the children _meta_end_dot_

 it turns out humans have d cks _meta_end_dot_

 no you don t say _meta_end_dot_

 my guess is that if jesus actually existed he would get a good belly laugh out of people being offended that he had a penis _meta_end_dot_

 yeah don t worry about feeding the poor or anything _meta_end_dot_

 just obsess over jesus s chocolate covered penis _meta_end_dot_

 i m sure that s what the good lord would have wanted _meta_end_dot_

 so is the argument that jesus didn t have a d ck cenk uygur _meta_number_ref_ i know i m a jewish lesbian and ahmadinejad would probably have me killed _meta_end_dot_

 but still the guy speaks some blunt truths about the bush administration that make me swoon _meta_end_dot_

 okay i admit it _meta_end_dot_

 part of it is that he just looks cuddly _meta_end_dot_

 possibly cuddly enough to turn me straight _meta_end_dot_

 i think he kind of looks like kermit the frog _meta_end_dot_

 sort of _meta_end_dot_

 with smaller eyes _meta_end_dot_

 but that s not all _meta_end_dot_

 i want to be very clear _meta_end_dot_

 there are certainly many things about ahmadinejad that i abhor locking up dissidents executing of gay folks denying the fact of the holocaust potentially adding another dangerous nuclear power to the world and in general stifling democracy _meta_end_dot_

 even still i can t help but be turned on by his frank rhetoric calling out the horrors of the bush administration and for that matter generations of us foreign policy preceding sallykohn _meta_number_ref_ when ss kissing chickensh t david petraeus lied his ss off before congress about the failed surge capitol hill police tackled and arrested a pentecostal minister damaging his ankle in the process _meta_end_dot_

 if you think america isn t undergoing the same slide into fascist dictatorship today as germany did in the _meta_number_ref_s you re kidding yourself _meta_end_dot_

 those two reasons more than the brutal assaults on people and the first amendment are why america is devolving into a bad replay of nazi germany _meta_end_dot_

 the lack of national outrage to the point we do something about it and the support of it by mindless groupthinkers in society who are so stupid they think it s a good thing that we re being subjected to tyranny archangel m _meta_number_ref_ is congress being blackmailed by w h _meta_end_question_

 is it spinelessness political caution to get ind _meta_end_dot_

 voters in _meta_number_ref_ financial profiteering from mil ind complex investments lack of conviction or simply not being good at stopping rethug s from blocking legislation that makes our congress ineffectual _meta_end_question_

 or is there another more nefarious reason for their inability to stand up to white house _meta_end_question_

 i made a comment earlier about how pelosi talked tough to w h _meta_end_dot_

 but then backed down on everything _meta_end_dot_

 senate can t put up any real fights either _meta_end_dot_

 couldn t even nab gonzo _meta_end_dot_

 now we get the fisa telecomm deal _meta_end_dot_

 i got to wondering if lots of dem _meta_end_dot_

 congress people are being blackmailed _meta_end_dot_

 that would explain a lot of folding and playing dead _meta_end_dot_

 wireless surveillance could have been done on our house senate people learning things that rove could use and now they re afraid _meta_end_dot_

 maybe they were even quietly threatened with plantings of drugs kid porn gay porn national review that kind of sorted thing _meta_end_dot_

 you get tagged with any of this stuff and your career is over rainmanjr _meta_number_ref_ i have never in my _meta_number_ref_ years of life been more frightened then i am now _meta_end_dot_

 i have seen the arrogance of this white house and the massive damage done to our country _meta_end_dot_

 but the katrina size storm clouds are gathering folks _meta_end_dot_

 if we do not wake up now and flood congress to impeach the president and vice president one year from now daily kos may be banned and markos himself may be disappeared in a federal prison somewhere _meta_end_dot_

 this is deadly serious folks _meta_end_dot_

 this is not just another diary _meta_end_dot_

 we ignore this threat at our own peril _meta_end_dot_

 i would suggest even i in writing articles like this and the many writers at daily kos are personally at risk of being arrested in a future dictatorial united states _meta_end_dot_

 the government will use these writings as an excuse to put us away _meta_end_dot_

 i say wake up daily kos _meta_end_exclamation_

 if the people at daily kos cannot take this seriously and try and do something about it then the united states as a free country is doomed _meta_end_dot_

 enjoy your freedom to read and write at such sites as daily kos because that freedom will be taken away when bush declares martial law slw_meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ and anyone liebercrat or republican who stands to oppose impeachment conviction and removal should be tried for their role as accomplice in the sedition and treason against the united states _meta_end_dot_

 no more should they be permitted to hide behind snivelling protocols and talk out both sides of their mouths either they are with the nation or they are part of the criminal conspiracy currently thwarting the will of both congress and the people greyhawk _meta_number_ref_ we need to lose this war and not start the next one so that we can remain a free people _meta_end_dot_

 diminished on the world stage _meta_end_question_

 perhaps like great britain was diminished when it surrendered its colonial empire _meta_end_dot_

 but free bluedogtxn _meta_number_ref_ the parallels are undeniable and i see only one solution if america the grand experiment is to survive _meta_end_dot_

 i want to stand by and watch it all blow up _meta_end_dot_

 i want the dollar to plunge to worthless paper _meta_end_dot_

 i want the stock market to implode _meta_end_dot_

 i want the economy to plunge into chaos _meta_end_dot_

 i want the chinese to call in all the debt they hold _meta_end_dot_

 i want an economic meltdown of such staggering proportion that even that idiot on bill moyer s journal who does not know the difference between a state constitution and the united states constitution is forced to look around in mild surprise and wonder what the hell happened _meta_end_dot_

 only total economic destruction will get the attention of the fools _meta_end_dot_

 and i want it now before this inept self serving congress allows the facists one more opportunity to fully convert this from the united states of america into the _meta_number_ref_th reich granny doc _meta_number_ref_ but do i still support the individual men and women who have given so much to serve their country _meta_end_question_

 no _meta_end_dot_

 i think they re a bunch of idiots _meta_end_dot_

 i also think they re morally retarded _meta_end_dot_

 because they sign a contract that says they will kill whoever you tell me to kill _meta_end_dot_

 and that is morally retarded _meta_end_dot_

 friends the most important moral decision a man makes in the course of a day is who am i going to kill today that s a decision you should agonize over dream about rehearse in your mind for hours not just leave up to some hare brained president you didn t even vote for _meta_end_dot_

 a man s killing list is a very personal matter _meta_end_dot_

 it should be between him and those persistent voices in his head _meta_end_dot_

 so to sum up i don t like our troops i don t like what they re doing i don t like their fat whining families and yet i support them _meta_end_dot_

 thank god i live in a free country _meta_end_dot_

 thank you awhitneybrown also see the worst quotes from the daily kos for _meta_number_ref_
