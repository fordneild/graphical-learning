  this is incredibly tacky and tasteless a controversial billboard in orange county has a picture of the burning world trade center and the message please don t vote for a democrat the man who paid for the ad says he s trying to help republicans but officials with both political parties are calling the billboard inappropriate _meta_end_dot_

 the man behind the billboard is mike meehan a st _meta_end_dot_

 cloud businessman and musician _meta_end_dot_

 his website advertises a cd and music video titled the republican song with the chorus don t vote for a democrat he s selling cds for _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 orange county democrats are calling for the billboard to come down and the local republican party has said the ad is inappropriate meehan hadn t returned channel _meta_number_ref_ calls or e mails monday afternoon but some are defending his right to free speech _meta_end_dot_

 it s bad enough to use images of _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ for blatant political pandering but this is actually even worse _meta_end_dot_

 on meehan s website it says the republican song title is actually please don t vote for a democrat and the whole point of the website is to sell the song _meta_end_dot_

 so in other words this guy is using an image of _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ to peddle his _meta_number_ref_th rate song about politics for _meta_dollor_ref_ a pop _meta_end_dot_

 no _meta_end_dot_

 class _meta_end_dot_
