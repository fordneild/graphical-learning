 the magazine will be live blogging their hate speech trial this monday beginning around _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ pst from a west coast court house _meta_end_dot_

 steyn will be there for most of the week and will no doubt post updates to his homepage _meta_end_dot_

 freemarksteyn will serve as clearing house for reactions _meta_end_dot_

 but there is hope on the horizon after a six month campaign by bloggers and ordinary canadians the government may just may be prepared to investigate our corrupt human rights commissions _meta_end_dot_

 meanwhile those of us facing a lawsuit for daring to criticize hrc methods on our blogs are still on the hook for now simply for publicizing the very irregularities that the government now wants to investigate _meta_end_exclamation_

 thanks again to all the rwn readers who have expressed their support for us in the great white north struggling to reclaim our basic right to freedom of speech from the clutches of time serving multi culti leftwing bureaucrats _meta_end_dot_
