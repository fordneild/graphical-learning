  it s pretty universally well known that the republicans are in huge trouble as they ve lost a number of special elections that i don t know much about but all the smart people say are very important _meta_end_dot_

 at least i know i don t care much more republicans anymore they lately just seem like a less mincing version of the democrats _meta_end_dot_

 frankly things are so bad that for republicans that if the democrats don t get the white house and huge gains in the house and senate they should really all jump off a bridge for sucking that much _meta_end_dot_

 so the republicans obviously need a new strategy if they want to regain power and talking about how bad the other side is just ain t it _meta_end_dot_

 everyone knows the democrats suck but do they know if the republicans don t suck _meta_end_question_

 i sure don t _meta_end_dot_

 republicans really need to be for something _meta_end_dot_

 for instance they can t just hope to win saying how bad liberals are they need to be for something such as for punching liberals since they re so bad _meta_end_dot_

 now i m no karl rove i don t even like the taste of souls but here are my ideas for a stronger reinvigorated republican party _meta_end_dot_

 frank ideas for the republican party to reinvigorate the republican party cut pork republicans have gotten bad with spending so it will take a lot of work to get credibility on that issue _meta_end_dot_

 they can t only oppose future pork they should take it a step further and oppose pork already passed _meta_end_dot_

 that means getting some c_meta_number_ref_ and totally blowing up useless projects built with pork _meta_end_dot_

 think of how dynamic it would be for a republican to walk into some building holding a bomb and saying justify this places existence or i will destroy it that s free media attention right there _meta_end_dot_

 punch the hippies i know _meta_end_dot_

 you re saying there goes frank being a mean republican again but if you check the hippie care handbook last updated in the seventies hippies need to be punched on a regular basis or they get shrill to the point of being a extreme public nuisance _meta_end_dot_

 now others may argue that punching hippies just because they re idiots is a freedom of speech issue but freedom of speech was only really intended for people with coherent things to say _meta_end_dot_

 you cannot make a rational argument that the founding fathers would have put up with hippies _meta_end_dot_

 you may say they wouldn t punch them but that s just because they d shoot them with musket or run them through with a cutlass or am i getting the founding fathers confused with pirates _meta_end_question_

 anyway the point is that hippie punching is necessary public service that would be cheered on by george washington thomas jefferson and blackbeard _meta_end_dot_

 next time hippies have a whiny protest near someplace with republicans all the republicans should charge them screaming rarr _meta_end_exclamation_

 hippies that should just be as natural as breathing _meta_end_dot_

 the american public wants a party they know won t put up with stupid smelly hippies and the republicans are the only ones who can step up and be that party _meta_end_dot_

 pile of justice what do we do with all the terrorists we kill _meta_end_question_

 i doubt anything too useful my guess is they re just lying around somewhere _meta_end_dot_

 but lying around in the middle east doesn t help us any we need them here _meta_end_dot_

 think of it a big pile of dead terrorists on the national mall in d c _meta_end_dot_

 with a sign in front of it saying brought to you by the republican party now people can see exactly what republican party policies have accomplished _meta_end_dot_

 and what can the democrats do in rebuttal _meta_end_question_

 put next to it their big pile of whining about healthcare and crap _meta_end_question_

 i know i ve said this idea before but it s worth repeating a big pile of dead terrorists equals election victory _meta_end_dot_

 exploit democrat sissiness a big advantage the republicans have over democrats are that democrats are bunch of sissies scared of their own shadows _meta_end_dot_

 this advantage is of no use if republicans don t exploit it though _meta_end_dot_

 next time some democrat is on the house floor saying something stupid a republican needs to go up and knock him down without saying a word _meta_end_dot_

 what is the democrat going to do about _meta_end_question_

 nothing that s what _meta_end_dot_

 need to block a bill in the senate but don t have enough people for a filibuster _meta_end_question_

 grab the bill from the democrat and play keep away with it _meta_end_dot_

 accomplishes that exact same thing _meta_end_dot_

 if republicans do things right they can be the minority party get everything they want and make the democrats do all the work _meta_end_dot_

 that s smart politicking right there _meta_end_dot_

 robot suits what if we could nominate iron man as our presidential candidate _meta_end_question_

 he couldn t be attacked on his personal life because people wouldn t know who he is _meta_end_dot_

 what they would know about him is that he can blow up tanks _meta_end_dot_

 and if you have iron man in a debate with a democrat who are people going to vote for the guy in the cool robot suit with rocket boots or the whiny democrat _meta_end_question_

 that s why we need to develop cool robot suits the technical terms for suits that make you look like a robot and instead of deploying them militarily use them in a political setting _meta_end_dot_

 you don t have to worry about democrats doing the same thing because robot suits have weapons on them and democrats are scared of those _meta_end_dot_

 remind people that being a republican is fun everybody loves that game grand theft auto iv so about a new game called grand old party _meta_end_dot_

 it will be the same in that you run around the city doing whatever you want but in this game you get away with everything because you re rich and a republican with a gun sort of a republican simulator _meta_end_dot_

 in real life we keep hearing how rich republican are so why don t we see that more _meta_end_question_

 they should be driving around in fast cars with hot women and they shouldn t even campaign because they should be like too cool to care what people think about them _meta_end_dot_

 then everyone will want to be a republican _meta_end_dot_

 but we won t let them _meta_end_dot_

 it s exclusive _meta_end_dot_

 we ll constantly reject people telling them sorry _meta_end_dot_

 you can t be a republican you re too lame _meta_end_dot_

 you ll have to vote for a democrat and then even more people will want to be republicans because they can t be _meta_end_exclamation_

 remind people america is great america is the most awesome country out there _meta_end_dot_

 think of some other country _meta_end_dot_

 well america is at least ten time more awesome than that country probably closer to a million times _meta_end_dot_

 what s with all the worrying about what other countries think about america _meta_end_question_

 we didn t use to care about that _meta_end_dot_

 not only should republicans keep reminding people how great america is which is closely related to the republican party and thus why democrats don t like flag pins but they should also produce a documentary showing how horrible it is to be a foreigner with their lack of freedoms stupid attitudes and funny hats _meta_end_dot_

 then people will remember how awful and stupid foreigners are and not care what they think once again just like god intended for america _meta_end_dot_

 ride a stampede of elephants into town this one is so obvious i don t know why we haven t seen it yet _meta_end_dot_

 the republican symbol is the elephant so why don t republicans ride into a town on a stampede of elephants destroying everything in its path _meta_end_question_

 that would awesome and eventually people would fear republicans like they did the huns _meta_end_dot_

 so those are my ideas for the republican party _meta_end_dot_

 they may seem elaborate but they all come down to having a clear vision of what you stand for standing strongly for those principles and acting like you re a god among men _meta_end_dot_

 it s the strategy that worked for the republicans in the eighties _meta_end_dot_
