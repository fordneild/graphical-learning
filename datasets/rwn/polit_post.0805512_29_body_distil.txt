  politico com reports on michelle obama s princeton senior thesis my experiences at princeton have made me far more aware of my blackness than ever before the future mrs _meta_end_dot_

 obama wrote in her thesis introduction _meta_end_dot_

 i have found that at princeton no matter how liberal and open minded some of my white professors and classmates try to be toward me i sometimes feel like a visitor on campus as if i really don t belong _meta_end_dot_

 regardless of the circumstances underwhich i interact with whites at princeton it often seems as if to them i will always be black first and a student second wrote about my relationship with my classmate ms _meta_end_dot_

 robinson a little while ago so naturally i love this item _meta_end_dot_

 it looks as if she played one intellectual academic spiritual note while at school and it would seem since then too _meta_end_dot_

 i also tried to turn my hobby into a senior thesis we all had to write one besides the engineers who actually had to do challenging academic work for the whole four years not just in the spring of senior year _meta_end_dot_

 the parallel with my earlier piece on michelle obama at princeton is kind of amusing again because i juxtaposed her interests and academic performance with my then obsession with college radio _meta_end_dot_

 and as it turns out i wrote an awful thesis about commercial college radio stations which was so bad that now i have determined for sure that i will never run for anything and neither will my wife at the risk of someone motoring down to princeton and digging up that piece of trash _meta_end_dot_

 on the other hand i pretty much outgrew my obsession when i went to law school _meta_end_dot_

 in contrast michelle obama has turned hers admittedly far more personal existential and meaningful than making a good segue from the end of radio free europe into a day in the life into a life _meta_end_dot_

 on the other other hand if she were actually the one running for president this particular focus would give me pause _meta_end_dot_

 is the other obama the candidate bigger than this _meta_end_question_

 he seems to be _meta_end_dot_

 i sure hope so for his sake and if the unthinkable happens and mcgovern wins this time for the country s _meta_end_dot_

 but i m looking for some comfort here _meta_end_dot_

 ron coleman s journey into self obsession is usually found at likelihood of success _meta_end_dot_

 his arguably more scholarly and socially useful material is at his law blog likelihood of confusion
