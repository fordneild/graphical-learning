  their discussion constituted a repudiation of the old boss daley of chicago who famously said that politics ain t beanbag _meta_end_dot_

 apparently politics is beanbag because that s all the democrats threw at each other tonight _meta_end_dot_

 i ve seen more conflict at a pacifists stir fry _meta_end_dot_

 hillary clinton and john edwards disgraced themselves in the minds of debate watchers everywhere _meta_end_dot_

 at some point in each campaign candidates are asked to name their greatest weakness _meta_end_dot_

 only the lamest political hacks answer that question this way goshdarn it i just care too much _meta_end_dot_

 i am too impatient for good things to happen _meta_end_dot_

 giving that answer is an insult to the art of politics _meta_end_dot_

 and yet edwards and clinton both gave that answer _meta_end_dot_

 they didn t even give artfully disguised versions of that answer _meta_end_dot_

 they gave the straight unsubtle kindergarten version of that answer _meta_end_dot_

 obama honestly admitted that he s bad at organizing his paperwork _meta_end_dot_

 truly here is a man willing to stand for change david brooks you have to be able to manage and run the bureaucracy that line from earlier in the debate has stuck in my head for over over an hour now _meta_end_dot_

 that s why hillary wants be president _meta_end_question_

 inspiring _meta_end_dot_

 never mind where exactly she has the experience to do such a thing kathryn jean lopez the corner out of the blocks nbc hosts brian williams and tim russert are nailing the candidates on their racial infighting this past week _meta_end_dot_

 don t believe it barak _meta_end_exclamation_

 watch your back hillary seems to be glaring at obama _meta_end_dot_

 she is not very warm tonight _meta_end_dot_

 maybe a supporter could ask her about her hair so she can break down in tears _meta_end_dot_

 obama accuses hillary of fear mongering to close the debate _meta_end_dot_

 the video is great just watching hillary glare at him gateway pundit will anyone give edwards the mitt treatment for saying he saw young men sit at a lunch counter to integrate the south _meta_end_question_

 this is a high def root canal the questions are all about campaign attacks and the candidates are pathetically trying to shift the conversation to policy _meta_end_dot_

 clinton s asked about her obama attacks what are the consequences of that in the fall against a republican candidate how the hell would she know david weigel hit run john edwards is asked about energy _meta_end_dot_

 he opposes building new nuclear power plants but also opposes us exploration and exploitation of new domestic fossil fuel sources _meta_end_dot_

 leaving what exactly to provide for our growing energy needs _meta_end_question_

 edwards favors the usual liberal bromides biofuels wind and solar _meta_end_dot_

 but left out of his answer is that increasing biofuel use is both inefficient you have to put more energy into creating the biofuel than you get out of it and puts more pressure on our food supply which will drive up the price of staple foods _meta_end_dot_

 solar hasn t yet become efficient enough to become a dominant energy source and the large windmills that are necessary to increase wind power use create their own environmental issues and are opposed for aesthetic reasons by liberals like the kennedy clan _meta_end_dot_

 edwards ends up opposing even doubling the number of worldwide nuclear power plants if that were possible because it would only deal with _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_th of the world s greenhouse gas problem _meta_end_dot_

 but isn t that quite a lot of capacity and quite a lot of effect on greenhouse gases that edwards would unilaterally turn down _meta_end_question_

 and edwards even opposes building new domestic coal fired power plants not for any energy reason but for environmental reasons _meta_end_dot_

 the other silly part of edwards answer is his insistence that the oil companies have a stranglehold on us energy policy _meta_end_dot_

 the fact is we re not exploring and exploiting all of our potential domestic resources and we re allowing the cubans to allow the chinese to explore oil sources _meta_number_ref_ miles off our coast _meta_end_dot_

 the oil companies are wealthy and they are powerful but it s hard to factually argue that they have a stranglehold on our energy policies _meta_end_dot_

 we haven t built new oil refineries in the us in decades _meta_end_dot_

 we can t explore anwr even though the people of alaska favor that _meta_end_dot_

 we re not building oil drills off the coast of california and florida _meta_end_dot_

 all of that is tied to environmentalist concerns not the oil companies and that s the reason we are so dependent on foreign sources of oil bryan hot air a yawn _meta_end_dot_

 a lovefest _meta_end_dot_

 call it what you want but by all accounts it was a less than electric affair _meta_end_dot_

 i guess that s what happens when you silence dennis kucinich _meta_end_dot_

 nevertheless with mitt romney s win in michigan dominating the national headlines and cable coverage the democratic debate was a non event the las vegas sun
