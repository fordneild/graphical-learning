  remember ronald barbour aka ronbo _meta_end_question_

 he was the blogger from freedom fighter s journal who wrote the following on his blog back on feb _meta_number_ref_ i understand the ______ building is more than _meta_number_ref_ feet tall _meta_end_dot_

 at the time of my last recon i noticed easy access to the roof that would allow someone to leap to their death to the parking lot below _meta_end_dot_

 i m not an expert in these matters but if i recall from my physics classes in college at _meta_number_ref_ feet a falling object reaches a speed of about _meta_number_ref_ mph _meta_end_dot_

 this means that the falling man would hit the pavement at a speed great enough to cause instant death _meta_end_dot_

 i understand that over the years since the construction of this building several persons have died by jumping from this structure _meta_end_dot_

 i plan to make such a leap _meta_end_dot_

 i do this in memory of the several hundred victims on _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ who jumped off the world trade center as a means of avoiding burning to death and the over _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ american soldiers killed fighting islamofascism in iraq and afghanistan _meta_end_dot_

 a parallel reason is a protest against the american left and the democrat party who have stabbed the armed forces in the back in the early stages of what is shaping up to be the third world war _meta_end_dot_

 this is an excellent time to make a final statement a dying declaration about an event that resulted in my life being ruined _meta_end_dot_

 on feb _meta_number_ref_ there was a funeral notice in the cleveland plain dealer ronald barbour age _meta_number_ref_ passed away feb _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ in the coreno funeral home _meta_number_ref_ lorain ave _meta_end_dot_

 at _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ pm _meta_end_dot_

 family will receive friends sunday _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ and _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ pm _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ many people thought that was the barbour from the blog post but there were a couple of hitches _meta_end_dot_

 ronbo lived in florida and was _meta_number_ref_ while the ronald barbour mentioned in the cleveland plain dealer was _meta_number_ref_ and died in cleveland _meta_end_dot_

 was it a hoax _meta_end_question_

 was it real _meta_end_question_

 it was hard to be sure _meta_end_dot_

 in any case on feb _meta_number_ref_th i shot an email to the address on freedom fighter s journal _meta_end_dot_

 here s how it read ronald i am hoping there is somebody on the other end of this who hasn t killed himself _meta_end_dot_

 if so shoot me an email back because i d like to talk to you _meta_end_dot_

 if not and this is a friend or family member reading ronald s email i m sorry for your loss _meta_end_dot_

 best wishes john hawkins yesterday i received a response to that email one that makes for gripping reading even if unfortunately it doesn t tie this whole issue situation up in a neat little bow _meta_end_dot_

 i am printing the email in its entirety with some names x d out to protect the privacy of the people involved dear john this is from a friend of ronbo and i live in central florida _meta_end_dot_

 on feb _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ while i was at work he slipped his pws to his email and blog under my front door with certain instructions and a copy of his last article _meta_end_dot_

 when i read the blog article i was naturally very upset and called the orlando pd who had no information on him _meta_end_dot_

 the next day i drove to xxxxxxxxxxxxxx where ronbo worked as a counselor and maintained a residence _meta_end_dot_

 i talked to a xxxxxxxxxxxxx who had been ronbo s supervisor _meta_end_dot_

 we talked for about half an hour and pumped each other for information _meta_end_dot_

 i gave him a brief and censored version of what i knew about ronbo and in return he shared some information he had about ronbo which i m sure was quite limited as was mine _meta_end_dot_

 in any event xxxxxxxx said that ronbo had suddenly disappeared one afternoon in late october _meta_number_ref_ from xxxxxxxxxxx and had abandoned all his property including his cell phone _meta_end_dot_

 he was last seen driving from the ccm parking lot in one of the company vehicles _meta_end_dot_

 this vehicle was found abandoned at the universal studios parking lot and discovered there the next day with the key in the ignition _meta_end_dot_

 there was no sign or foul play and a note in ronbo s handwriting was found on the dashboard saying that the vehicle was disabled and for security to call xxxxxxxxxxxxx for further instructions _meta_end_dot_

 xxxxxxxxxxx had no more contact with ronbo until approximately two weeks later when he saw ronbo walking in gym togs on major blvd _meta_end_dot_

 in orlando _meta_end_dot_

 he said he pulled over and attempted to talk to ronbo but that ronbo had quickly disappeared _meta_end_dot_

 this was the last ronbo sighting _meta_end_dot_

 xxxxxxxxxx did say that he looked the picture of health and did not appear to be depressed _meta_end_dot_

 he went on to say that some clients of ronbo had seen him on kirkman road several weeks after xxxxxxxx had seen him on major blvd so in xxxxxxxxx s opinion ronbo had been in orlando at least until early december very likely staying at a hotel near universal studios _meta_end_dot_

 after leaving xxxxxxxxxxxx i drove to major blvd which is only several blocks long i started asking about ronbo at various hotels _meta_end_dot_

 on the third hotel i hit pay dirt _meta_end_dot_

 the clerk not only remembered ronbo but said he had disappeared on feb _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_th leaving behind everything clothes baggage and an icebox full of food and a nearly new dell laptop and lots of computer software _meta_end_dot_

 this appeared strange to the hotel clerk since a few days before ronbo had given her a note that he would be leaving on feb _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_th and she had assumed that the room would be cleared of personal effects _meta_end_dot_

 i later talked to the manager of the hotel by phone who told me that he had filed a missing persons report on ronbo with the orlando pd _meta_end_dot_

 the name of this hotel was in town suites on major blvd i forget the street number i hope this helps _meta_end_dot_

 the number for xxxxxxxxxxxx is xxxxxxxxxxx _meta_end_dot_

 could this be a hoax _meta_end_question_

 could this be ronbo on the other end _meta_end_question_

 sure _meta_end_dot_

 could everything be just as this friend of ronbo s is saying _meta_end_question_

 sure _meta_end_dot_

 but if so what happened to ronbo _meta_end_question_

 update _meta_number_ref_ here s a _meta_number_ref_nd email from ronbo s friend that i received today dear john the cleveland ronald barbour who died on feb _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_th and the late california hiker ronald barbour are not the ronald barbour of orlando who i believe is very much alive somewhere _meta_end_dot_

 i believe this particular ronald barbour s main motive was to goad the secret service and tempt them into ill advised actions against him that he could use against them _meta_end_dot_

 i recall ronbo saying over the phone that his main purpose in life was to get an indictment against at least one secret service agent in revenge for his arrest in _meta_number_ref_ on what he considers bogus charges _meta_end_dot_

 sincerely xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
