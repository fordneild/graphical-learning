  the washington post is reporting that along with christopher dodd and kent conrad democratic presidential contender barack obama got a sweeter than normal deal on his mortgage the freshman democratic senator received a discount _meta_end_dot_

 he locked in an interest rate of _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ percent on the _meta_number_ref_ year fixed rate mortgage below the average for such loans at the time in chicago _meta_end_dot_

 the loan was unusually large known in banker lingo as a super super jumbo obama paid no origination fee or discount points as some consumers do to reduce their interest rates _meta_end_dot_

 compared with the average terms offered at the time in chicago obama s rate could have saved him more than _meta_dollor_ref_ per month _meta_end_dot_

 nice _meta_end_dot_

 i wonder if everyone could get as sweet a deal as that _meta_end_dot_

 i m not talking about the guy trying to scrape together a couple hundred thousand for a house _meta_end_dot_

 i talking about other richy rich folks _meta_end_dot_

 would they get the same deal as a former state senator who made it to the show _meta_end_question_

 nope in obama s case he received a lower rate than the average offered at the time in chicago for similarly structured jumbo loans _meta_end_dot_

 he secured his final mortgage commitment on june _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ and during that week rates on similar loans for which information is available averaged _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ percent according to hsh associates which surveys lenders _meta_end_dot_

 another survey firm bankrate com placed the average at _meta_number_ref_ percent _meta_end_dot_

 it s certainly safe to say that this borrower did better than average said keith gumbinger an hsh vice president noting that consumer rates vary widely _meta_end_dot_

 it s a good deal i m sure the obamatons will excuse this as nothing out of the ordinary even though the obamas had no prior relationship with northern trust when they applied for the loan sure usually you get a better deal than the people who have been banking there for years _meta_end_dot_

 that s how it works _meta_end_dot_

 see the bank didn t really treat him an differently than anyone else unlike countrywide where leaked internal e mails documented a special discount program for friends of chief executive angelo mozilo northern trust says it has no formal program to provide discounts to public officials _meta_end_dot_

 loan officers may consider a borrower s occupation when establishing an interest rate the bank said _meta_end_dot_

 they just consider the occupation of united states senator the same way they would say dog catcher or airline pilot _meta_end_dot_

 oh and then there is this since _meta_number_ref_ northern trust employees have donated more than _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ to federal campaigns including _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ to obama according to the center for responsive politics _meta_end_dot_

 probably nothing to that either _meta_end_dot_

 next big speech for barack i will never question anyone s mortgage and i condemn anyone who does cross posted at all american blogger where you can find other great original articles _meta_end_dot_
