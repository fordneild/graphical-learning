  granted neither of the first two movies in the rush hour series were masterpieces of cinema but both were decent flicks _meta_end_dot_

 the same can t be said for rush hour _meta_number_ref_ which i caught on video this week end _meta_end_dot_

 aside from this one entertaining moment there wasn t a lot worth seeing in this silly mess of a movie
