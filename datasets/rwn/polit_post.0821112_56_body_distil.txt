  much was made of the fact that nancy pelosi was the first female speaker of the house _meta_end_dot_

 however little has been said about the fact that under the first female speaker of the house the approval rating of congress has dropped to the lowest level in recorded history _meta_end_dot_

 in other words the first female speaker of the house in history has also been the worst speaker of the house in history _meta_end_dot_

 having an incompetent who can t find her own behind with both hands as the first woman speaker isn t exactly a big step forward for women _meta_end_dot_

 ps my guess is that if barack obama gets in the same will be said about him _meta_end_dot_

 having a guy who s inexperienced has poor judgment and thinks there are more than _meta_number_ref_ states as the first black president probably wouldn t end up being a huge step forward for black americans _meta_end_dot_
