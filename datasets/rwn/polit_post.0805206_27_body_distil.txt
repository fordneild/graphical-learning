  yesterday hillariously obama supporter texas state senator kirk watson got pinned down by chris matthews and was forced to admit that he supported obama despite the fact that he couldn t name a single thing that obama had ever accomplished _meta_end_dot_

 here s the video if you d like to watch watson being humiliated but wait it gets better _meta_end_exclamation_

 how _meta_end_question_

 well after the fact watson actually tried to come up with a list of obama s accomplishments after the fact _meta_end_dot_

 so imagine it watson is highly motivated because he has made his candidate look bad on tv so he does heavy research he talks to his fellow obama supporters and he probably even called obama s campaign _meta_end_dot_

 so what did watson manage to come up with _meta_end_question_

 this is it _meta_end_dot_

 senator obama s fight for universal children s health care in illinois _meta_end_dot_

 his success bringing republicans and democrats together a huge selling point for me in general on bills such as the one in illinois requiring police interrogations and confessions to be videotaped _meta_end_dot_

 his leadership on ethics reform in washington the bill that lobbyists and special interests are complaining about right now has his name on it _meta_end_dot_

 his bill to make the federal budget far more transparent and accessible to americans via the internet we could use that openness in texas _meta_end_dot_

 and his vital work with republicans to lock down nuclear weapons around the world _meta_end_dot_

 so we have two mickey mouse items from his time in the state senate of illinois an ethics bill that was weaker than what republicans like jim demint wanted and a couple of bills that obama tagged along with republicans on that would have been passed with or without his support _meta_end_dot_

 that s it _meta_end_question_

 you mean you take that unimpressive set of accomplishments and combine it with repeating change hope unity and yes we can _meta_number_ref_ million times and that s good enough to make you president of the united states _meta_end_question_

 how pathetic _meta_end_dot_
