  megan mcardle writes about r acism and conservatives via instapundit _meta_end_dot_

 the comments are really interesting _meta_end_dot_

 go read them _meta_end_dot_

 the opinions range from a self righteous defense of white guilt to diminishing the contributions of prominent black conservatives because they re not really conservative _meta_end_dot_

 so let me get this straight liberals are better than conservatives because they feel bad that there s racism and they re justified in using blacks to make them feel better but that s not racism that s promoting diversity _meta_end_dot_

 as ms _meta_end_dot_

 mcardle says it s also worth noting that the presidential candidate who has done the most to exploit the racism of others this election season is liberal democrat hillary clinton whose campaign though bullish on sexism has spent a lot more time talking about how it is constrained by political correctness in its campaign against barack obama than being concerned with actual racism _meta_end_dot_

 conservative find discrimination based on race or gender repugnant _meta_end_dot_

 as the democratic primary season has amply demonstrated identity politics when taken to its logical end is absurd _meta_end_dot_

 what is the big idea on the left these days _meta_end_question_

 how does feeling guilty for wrongs people committed generations ago change the reality today _meta_end_question_

 how does feeling better because you re guilty help _meta_end_question_

 it s irrational _meta_end_dot_

 and the policies that liberals espouse are irrational and lead to the exact opposite place they intend _meta_end_dot_

 new orleans is a liberal government let to run amok for years _meta_end_dot_

 in the north there s detroit and philadelphia _meta_end_dot_

 all three cities have been run by liberal policies _meta_end_dot_

 the results have been anything but good especially for black people _meta_end_dot_

 and in places like key west and san francisco other places where liberal politics are practiced poor people of any color cannot live there _meta_end_dot_

 now who exactly is discriminatory _meta_end_question_

 and then there are the individual implications _meta_end_dot_

 one of my genius friends happens to be black he s not genius enough to be conservative _meta_end_dot_

 he was educated in a fantastic university and not because of affirmative action _meta_end_dot_

 but how galling would it be to work your ass off and be presumed to have needed lowered standards in order to make it _meta_end_question_

 it is irrational to believe that racism doesn t exist _meta_end_dot_

 it does _meta_end_dot_

 it is also irrational to believe that by focusing on race and feeling guilty racism will end _meta_end_dot_
