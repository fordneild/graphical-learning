  from silent no more i was _meta_number_ref_ and a freshman at college when i got the test results _meta_end_dot_

 the nurse told me it was positive _meta_end_dot_

 without any hesitation i told her i wanted to schedule an abortion _meta_end_dot_

 she didn t even blink an eye _meta_end_dot_

 there was nothing no counseling no cautions nor any medical information given me about my baby myself or the possible consequences _meta_end_dot_

 just see you friday at _meta_number_ref_ i couldn t focus _meta_end_dot_

 sometimes i couldn t bear the thought of sitting anymore in class especially the _meta_number_ref_ hour studio classes so i wouldn t go back after break _meta_end_dot_

 my grades suffered _meta_end_dot_

 i had always been an a student but not anymore _meta_end_dot_

 one teacher gave me a d even though my work did not merit that _meta_end_dot_

 i begged my mother to let me quit school _meta_end_dot_

 she said no _meta_end_dot_

 i suffered for _meta_number_ref_ years before a friend gave me a book on anxiety between that and becoming a christian i thought my problems should be solved _meta_end_dot_

 but it wasn t until a pastor gave a sermon on abortion on sanctity of human life sunday _meta_number_ref_ that i faced the truth _meta_end_dot_

 i had killed my own child and the world had told me i wasn t supposed to grieve _meta_end_dot_

 what a lie _meta_end_exclamation_

 so all my grief despair and anguish manifested itself in anxiety and depression because i wasn t supposed to grieve abortion was legal and that made it ok abortion is the biggest lie that has been passed down to this country _meta_end_dot_

 it is the worst holocaust of our time _meta_end_dot_

 there are two victims in each abortion the child and the mother _meta_end_dot_

 so many children are dead and so many mothers crushed in spirit because they bought the choice argument the absurd idea that the act of being able to choose is important rather than what is chosen _meta_end_dot_

 never has anything been at the same time so wicked and so stupid as pro choice it is a phrase which sounds like it is a good thing but which masks a moral depravity never plumbed before in human history while also being a phrase so idiotic that were a con man to try it on us we d laugh at him _meta_end_dot_

 if a person doesn t choose the right thing then it would be better if they made no choice at all _meta_end_dot_
