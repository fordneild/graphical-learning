  over time as people continue relentlessly hammering obama for being vacuous his whole change unity hope meme will sound increasingly hollow _meta_end_dot_

 then eventually it ll become like john kerry mentioning his service in vietnam people will groan and roll their eyes when he says the words change unity or hope at that point he ll be in trouble because hope sounds a lot better than taking your handguns away from you _meta_end_dot_

 unity sounds much better than a trillion dollar tax increase _meta_end_dot_

 change sounds a lot better than wasting the sacrifices of our troops and creating a wave of genocide in iraq by starting to pull out come hell or high water in early _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 once you get out of the platitudes and into the nitty gritty obama won t sound very appealing because he s touting an agenda that has already been for the most part at least rejected by the american people _meta_end_dot_

 does that mean obama loses _meta_end_question_

 not necessarily because mccain has his own problems but obama is a much weaker candidate than people think _meta_end_dot_

 he s a ted kennedyesque ultra liberal empty suit who s not qualified to be president running a campaign that sounds like it came off an episode of sesame street and that reality is going to hit him square in the teeth at some point in the campaign _meta_end_dot_
