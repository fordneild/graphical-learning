  i like fox news and think they do a much better job than their competitors but republicans in d c _meta_end_dot_

 should realize by now that the views of analysts on fox news are much more representative of beltway republicans than they are of the views of conservatives across the country _meta_end_dot_

 put another way if you re hoping to get a feel for what conservatives think pay attention to talk radio and the blogosphere not fox news _meta_end_dot_
