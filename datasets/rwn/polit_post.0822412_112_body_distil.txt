  part of my duty as a professional blogger is to read the tabloid stories that most of you are too classy to touch with a _meta_number_ref_ ft _meta_end_dot_

 pole so that i can let you know whether we have another john edwards rielle hunter scandal or merely the political version of batboy _meta_end_dot_

 so when i saw this on the cover of the globe i knew i was going to have to step up and buy it _meta_end_dot_

 long story short according to the globe bush is off the wagon and sleeping with condi laura is sick of it and they re in splitsville _meta_end_dot_

 the globe says they are already living apart and laura is buying a home in dallas _meta_end_dot_

 is there anything to it _meta_end_question_

 well there are three things that say there isn t _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ there are no named sources in the piece _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ they post a pic of bush downing a cold one in germany last year _meta_end_dot_

 however the beer bush is drinking is non alcoholic _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ they quote bush as saying laura s over there in dallas trying to buy a house _meta_end_dot_

 i like crawford but unfortunately after eight years of sacrifice i m apparently no longer the decision maker that quote is real however laura doesn t appear to be moving to dallas solo dallas county may be turning democratic but it s about to gain two prominent republican residents the bushes are moving back to town _meta_end_dot_

 first lady laura bush was in dallas on thursday to introduce a national program designed to expose urban children to nature _meta_end_dot_

 mrs _meta_end_dot_

 bush and students from williams preparatory school shook a shrub and examined what fell from it _meta_end_dot_

 first lady laura bush confirmed thursday that she and her husband will return to the area when they leave the white house in january _meta_end_dot_

 i guess i can announce it in front of the press mrs _meta_end_dot_

 bush said at a national park foundation event at williams preparatory school in dallas _meta_end_dot_

 president bush and i will be moving back to dallas which is where we lived before mr _meta_end_dot_

 bush was elected governor in _meta_number_ref_ she said _meta_end_dot_

 after _meta_number_ref_ years away we re excited about having this chance to live here again the first lady said _meta_end_dot_

 it s long been thought likely that the bushes would come back to the area after his presidency but thursday s statement was the most definitive yet that the couple would live in dallas where mr _meta_end_dot_

 bush s presidential library will be built at southern methodist university _meta_end_dot_

 white house communications director kevin sullivan said the couple will split their time between dallas and their ranch in crawford _meta_end_dot_

 if laura were really splitting from w how likely is it that out of the entire us she would choose to move to the same city where his presidential library is going to be located _meta_end_question_

 it doesn t seem likely at all and neither come to think of it is this story in the globe _meta_end_dot_
