  if you add together government bureaucracy liberal political correctness health care it s not surprising that the result is something like this which is occurring in britain overworked nurses have been ordered to stop all medical work five times every day to move muslim patients beds so they face towards mecca _meta_end_dot_

 the lengthy procedure which also includes providing fresh bathing water is creating turmoil among overstretched staff on bustling nhs wards _meta_end_dot_

 but despite the havoc mid yorkshire nhs trust says the rule must be instigated whenever possible to ensure muslim patients have a more comfortable stay in hospital _meta_end_dot_

 last night critics slammed the procedure and claimed the nhs would be better off investing its resources in tackling killer superbugs such as c diff and mrsa _meta_end_dot_

 one experienced nurse working at dewsbury said it would be easier to create muslim only wards with every bed facing mecca than have to deal with this _meta_end_dot_

 some people might think it is not that big a deal but we have a huge muslim population in dewsbury and if we are having to turn dozens of beds to face mecca five times a day plus provide running water for them to wash before and after prayers it is bound to impact on the essential medical service we are supposed to be providing _meta_end_dot_

 although the beds are designed to be moved the bays are not really suitable for having loads of beds moved around to face a different direction and despite our best efforts it does cause disruption for non muslim patients the changes have been instigated by dewsbury and district hospital s chief matron catherine briggs after she held a series of consultation meetings with local asian gps ethnic minority patients groups and muslim chaplain ilyas dalal to find out what staff could do to further improve muslim patients experience of the nhs _meta_end_dot_

 welcome to the bureaucratic mentality my friends _meta_end_exclamation_

 just imagine taking the compassion of the irs combining it with the competence of fema and the efficiency of the dmv and then turning it loose on health care in this country _meta_end_dot_

 that s what we re headed towards if hillary clinton and company get their way _meta_end_dot_

 ps want to change our health care for the better without handing it over to the government _meta_end_question_

 take away the enormous tax breaks we currently hand over to companies for health care and allow people to get tax breaks for their own individual policies _meta_end_dot_

 that would allow many more americans to be covered it would put an end to people losing their health coverage because they lost their jobs and it would drive down the cost of health care _meta_end_dot_

 it s a much better more efficient solution to our problems than socialized medicine _meta_end_dot_
