  question would you pay to have breakfast with chelsea coolczech answer there s not a woman on earth that i would pay to have breakfast with unless you re talking about say picking up the check for breakfast _meta_end_dot_

 i would go that far _meta_end_dot_

 as to chelsea unlike a lot of other people i do think she s cute but i strongly suspect that she s a mess from having grown up in the dysfunctional clinton household and having lived through the media circus that came with it _meta_end_dot_

 still it would be interesting to have breakfast with her especially if you could get her off of spinning her mother s campaign spiel and on to what she really thinks about the world plus hey it would be pretty cool to say you had breakfast with chelsea clinton _meta_end_dot_
