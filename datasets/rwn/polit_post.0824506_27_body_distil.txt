  the geniuses over at the world s most influential liberal blog have another uh let s call it unconventional theory about sarah palin _meta_end_dot_

 from daily kos diarist berkeybee palin will not be the vp nominee this is just a karl rove head fake to take away attention from the democratic convention the most incredible convention with the best acceptance speech in the history of the usa _meta_end_dot_

 instead sarah will tearfully decide to stay at home with her kids and try to hang on to her seat as governor of alaska in the face of continuing investigations _meta_end_dot_

 mccain will ask romney to accept and it will look oh so good so mccain selected palin as a head fake because that happens all the time in politics _meta_end_question_

 presidential candidates select vps as a distraction and then once the excitement dies down they replace them with less exciting nominees who are less popular with the general public the base and with a huge important demographic group women _meta_end_dot_

 really _meta_end_question_

 of course not even the kossacks could believe something this off the wall could they _meta_end_question_

 the good news is that most of them don t _meta_end_dot_

 the bad news is _meta_end_dot_

 yes believe it or not more than _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ of the kossacks believe that the selection of palin is some sort of rove inspired ruse that s just designed to blunt the impact of the democratic convention _meta_end_dot_

 remember that old saying you can fool all the people some of the time and some of the people all the time but you cannot fool all the people all the time _meta_end_question_

 well anybody who buys into something this silly must fall into that middle category _meta_end_dot_
