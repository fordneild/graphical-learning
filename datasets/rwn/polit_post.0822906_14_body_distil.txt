  it s hard to believe that we are now less than _meta_number_ref_ weeks away from a presidential election with momentous implications for america s future hanging in the balance for starters are america s entire national security strategy and potentially the seats of several supreme court justices in a court that is ideologically split _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ as well as numerous other lifetime judicial appointments to federal courts _meta_end_dot_

 dan balz points out at the trail that the next three weeks are critical in the modern era there has never been quite as concentrated a dose of potentially campaign altering events as the coming three weeks could produce _meta_end_dot_

 by the end of that period obama and mccain will have announced their vice presidential running mates staged four day infomercials for their candidacies and delivered what are likely to be the single most important speeches of the general election _meta_end_dot_

 for those who revel in the unpredictability of politics this calendar is ready made for enjoyment _meta_end_dot_

 the cascading events will heighten the cost of mistakes affect the post convention bounce for obama and perhaps mccain supercharge the traditional labor day opening of the fall campaign and raise the stakes on the two presidential nominees not to misuse their conventions as john kerry did four years ago _meta_end_dot_

 normally these events have stretched over six weeks or more and generally have taken place much earlier in the summer _meta_end_dot_

 voters have had time to fully digest each one before the next has occurred _meta_end_dot_

 that changed this year because the democratic and republican parties decided to hold their conventions back to back and later than ever before _meta_end_dot_

 it also changed because despite much speculation to the contrary obama and mccain have waited until just before the conventions to name their vice presidents _meta_end_dot_

 the competitiveness of the obama mccain contest now argues for safe vice presidential choices _meta_end_dot_

 neither is in a position to risk nor does either need a running mate whose selection dramatically changes perceptions of their candidacies _meta_end_dot_

 the choice of v p _meta_end_dot_

 has to be especially agonizing for obama there are so many things that can go wrong _meta_end_dot_

 first of all obama s appeal is based on looking and sounding good and on being something new and different a black man running for the presidency whoever obama picks for v p they will not be another obama they will dilute his brand bring it back down earth ah we have two humans here not the one needless to say the option of picking hillary clinton as v p _meta_end_dot_

 is dead on arrival unless as others have put it obama wants to spend his entire candidacy and hoped for presidency with his head on a swivel i mean get real would you want hillary as your v p her ambition is too palpable how well would you sleep at night with hillary as your second fiddle _meta_end_question_

 another problem is that obama has to find a v p _meta_end_dot_

 who doesn t overshadow him with obama s limited total time in national politics and his total absence of military and foreign policy experience it has to be a real challenge to find a v p _meta_end_dot_

 with any experience at all whose credentials don t outweigh those of obama himself and while our current president was wise enough to choose a v p _meta_end_dot_

 dick cheney with three decades of political experience under his belt i m not sure if obama wants a more experienced v p _meta_end_dot_

 standing by his side will practicality win over hubris _meta_end_question_

 this week s rumor is that john f _meta_end_dot_

 kerry is under consideration as obama s veep let s consider this purely on a superficial level because that s where obama is coming from a on the plus side kerry spent four months in vietnam which is more military experience than obama has but b on the negative side kerry is about three inches taller will it do for the messiah to be shorter than his sidekick _meta_end_question_

 mccain doesn t have the same problem he can pick his v p _meta_end_dot_

 from any number of candidates without being concerned that he will look weak or inexperienced by comparison in picking a v p mccain does have to walk a tightrope to try to avoid alienating either his moderate base or the conservatives he needs to win but that s a challenge he has thus far somehow survived _meta_end_dot_

 in any event all will be revealed and soon _meta_end_dot_

 buckle up _meta_end_exclamation_
