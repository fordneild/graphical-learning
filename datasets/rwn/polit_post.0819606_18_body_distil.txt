  on feb of _meta_number_ref_ rwn released an interview with dennis avery the co author of unstoppable global warming every _meta_number_ref_ years _meta_end_dot_

 the first interview with dennis avery was one of my all time faves because i have never talked to anyone who does a better job of quickly and precisely demolishing the alarmism and silliness of the manmade global warming crowd _meta_end_dot_

 with that in mind last week i thought it would be a great time to get together with dennis avery for another interview _meta_end_dot_

 so here s a slightly edited transcript of our phone conversation from last week _meta_end_dot_

 enjoy _meta_end_exclamation_

 the very mild warming that the earth experienced over the last century does that have more to do with mankind s activities or the sun _meta_end_question_

 it seems like it must be the sun _meta_end_dot_

 the reason we say that is because _meta_percent_ref_ of the warming we ve had since _meta_number_ref_ when the little ice age ended _meta_percent_ref_ of that warming came before _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_percent_ref_ of the human emitted greenhouse gasses came after _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 in fact the net warming of the earth since _meta_number_ref_ is a miniscule _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ of _meta_number_ref_ degree celsius _meta_end_dot_

 another question related to your last book if you listen to global warming alarmists they ll tell you that the earth is warmer than it ever has been during mankind s history _meta_end_dot_

 is that true _meta_end_question_

 no _meta_end_dot_

 absolutely untrue _meta_end_dot_

 the warming before our last ice age was much warmer than anything we ve had since _meta_end_dot_

 we had a warming that peaked _meta_number_ref_ years ago another warming that peaked _meta_number_ref_ years ago _meta_end_dot_

 both were warmer than today _meta_end_dot_

 probably the roman warming and the medieval warming were both warmer than today and we ve had _meta_number_ref_ warmings of the earth since the last ice age _meta_end_dot_

 how do we know those periods were warmer than we are today _meta_end_question_

 we know this from paleontological evidence _meta_end_dot_

 from the ice cores which tell us the air temperature when that ice was laid down _meta_end_dot_

 we ve got the fossils of little fitoplankton critters in the ocean _meta_end_dot_

 they die their fossils are laid out in annual layers of sediment _meta_end_dot_

 we ve drilled down a million years with oil drilling equipment we bring up sediment instead of oil and the fossils tell us the temperature when that sediment was laid down _meta_end_dot_

 so with this kind of evidence we know the earth s temperature going back a million years and it has always been either warming or cooling _meta_end_dot_

 global warming has occurred at least to a certain extent over the last century but there seems to be some real debate over whether it is still occurring at all _meta_end_dot_

 you ve recently said you believe we re about to experience mild global cooling _meta_end_dot_

 can you tell us about that _meta_end_question_

 we are experiencing now mild global cooling _meta_end_dot_

 we had a peak temperature in _meta_number_ref_ at the end of a hot el nino and the climate model said this is just the beginning it s going to get much hotter _meta_end_dot_

 but it didn t _meta_end_dot_

 for _meta_number_ref_ years the temperature held stable _meta_end_dot_

 during this time from _meta_number_ref_ onward the sunspots were predicting cooling _meta_end_dot_

 let me point out to your readers that sunspots have had a strong history of predicting our temperature changes _meta_number_ref_ years from now _meta_end_dot_

 a _meta_number_ref_ year lag in predicting how solar activity will warm or cool the ocean _meta_end_dot_

 but from _meta_number_ref_ on they were predicting cooling _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ we got it _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ was significantly cooler and that was the first major downturn in the temperature in _meta_number_ref_ years _meta_end_dot_

 that cooling has persisted at this point in temperature about back where we were in the year _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 yesterday i debated a guy on the irish radio network and he said oh that s not true the un has not told me that the temperatures went down i said if the un can t read their own thermometers they re in even bigger trouble than i thought but the hadley centre in britain the goddard space institute here in the us and the university of alabama in huntsville which gathers data from the temperature satellites all told us the temperatures have gone down _meta_end_dot_

 they also just announced weeks ago that their satellite shows the pacific has shifted into a cooling phase _meta_end_dot_

 this is important because for the last _meta_number_ref_ years the earth s temperatures have mirrored the temperatures in the northern pacific _meta_end_dot_

 the end of the warming phase was _meta_number_ref_ then the pacific fluttered around for _meta_number_ref_ years and now the cooling phase has begun is likely to last for another _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ years moderate cooling not another ice age the same sort of cooling we had from _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 so would it be fair to say that for the next decade global temperatures are not going to get hotter than they were in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_question_

 they are likely to trend slowly downward not just for the next decade but for the next _meta_number_ref_ decades _meta_end_dot_

 many global warming alarmists say there is a scientific consensus on global warming that almost everyone agrees with them almost unanimously among scientists _meta_end_dot_

 is that true _meta_end_question_

 with the temperatures scheduled for a _meta_number_ref_ year cooling i think the consensus just went out the window _meta_end_dot_

 i think the consensus people have just run off a cliff like wile e _meta_end_dot_

 coyote in the roadrunner cartoons and they re in mid air with their feet spinning madly while they wait for the earth to smash them to the ground far below _meta_end_dot_

 now we regularly hear doomsday predictions about the terrible effects global warming is going to cause _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ years from now _meta_end_dot_

 how do they come up with those predictions and how much validity do you think they have _meta_end_question_

 i think they pull their predictions out of their hats and i don t think they have any validity whatsoever _meta_end_dot_

 another thing i have noticed is that even the global warming alarmists were right the solutions that they re suggesting don t come close to fixing the problems _meta_end_dot_

 kyoto these cap and trade schemes they are really expensive and actually do very little to reduce greenhouse gasses _meta_end_dot_

 any thoughts on that _meta_end_question_

 they re really talking about going back to the great depression _meta_end_dot_

 nobody has a car nobody could afford the fuel if they had a car _meta_end_dot_

 they re talking about living a hundred yards from the factory except there isn t going to be a factory because there is not going to be any coal burning to power it _meta_end_dot_

 no nuclear power no drilling for oil no hope _meta_end_dot_

 i just want to remind you that there are millions of people in the third world women and children heating and cooking with cow manure firewood that they gather off the mountainside _meta_end_dot_

 the air pollution in some of those areas is equal to a _meta_number_ref_ pack a day cigarette habit _meta_end_dot_

 if there s no kerosene no propane no nuclear electricity are we all going to be in that situation _meta_end_question_

 is there anything else you d like to say or promote before we finish _meta_end_question_

 i think we ve gotten most of it _meta_end_dot_

 thank you for your time _meta_end_dot_

 i appreciate it _meta_end_dot_
