  well recently a friend of mine reminded me that just prior to the _meta_number_ref_ election consumer confidence was unbelievably high regular gasoline sold for about _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ a gallon and the unemployment rate was _meta_number_ref_ _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 since then consumer confidence has plummeted gas now costs about a dollar and a half a gallon more unemployment stands at _meta_percent_ref_ american homeowners have seen their home equity drop by over a trillion dollars with one percent of our homes in foreclosure and for good measure the liberals refuse to eliminate earmarks _meta_end_dot_

 it wasn t all bad news though _meta_end_dot_

 the democratic controlled congress no doubt in appreciation for what they regarded as a job very well done voted to increase their own salaries burt prelutsky
