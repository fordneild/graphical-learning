 he added that the eye injury which caused patterson to miss a few days of work will be affectingher the rest of her life mostwomen i know have been injured by thongs _meta_end_dot_

 besides the physical damage there s the humiliation of knowing that she s willfully put a clothinggarment in her butt crack ostensibly to avoid a lesser disaster thedreaded panty lines men wouldn t wear a bra _meta_end_dot_

 men wouldn t wear highheels _meta_end_dot_

 melissa clouthier update from john hawkins half the time i m not sure if women are wearing all this uncomfortableclothing to impress men or other women _meta_end_dot_

 however i do know that if theplanet were all heterosexual men we d go out wearing jeans sweats sneakers and t shirts with holes in them _meta_percent_ref_ of the time _meta_end_dot_

 ofcourse if there were no women we d all be living in caves and wearingloincloths because pretty much every major accomplishment in history bymen has been at its root about impressing women _meta_end_dot_

 therefore if therewere no women no one would have ever invented jeans sweats sneakers and well t shirts would probably still be around _meta_end_dot_

 but they dprobably be made out of wood _meta_end_dot_
