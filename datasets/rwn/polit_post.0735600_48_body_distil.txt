  earlier today i hammered the huckabee campaign for not getting back to me within _meta_number_ref_ days time on an immigration question i had for them _meta_end_dot_

 well tonight i received a pleasant call from the lovely and talented charmaine yoest who works with the huckabee campaign _meta_end_dot_

 she apologized for the campaign s delay in getting back to me and answered all my questions _meta_end_dot_

 first of all definitively as i thought the huckabee immigration plan does not contain any sort of touchback provision _meta_end_dot_

 to the contrary huckabee s policy on illegal immigration is as follows policies that promote or tolerate amnesty will be rejected _meta_end_dot_

 propose to provide all illegal immigrants a _meta_number_ref_ day window to register with the bureau of citizenship and immigration services and leave the country _meta_end_dot_

 those who register and return to their home country will face no penalty if they later apply to immigrate or visit those who do not return home will be when caught barred from future reentry for a period of _meta_number_ref_ years _meta_end_dot_

 some people have pointed to something huckabee said on fox news sunday as evidence of a touchback plan wallace let s turn to immigration because you put out a new immigration plan this week _meta_end_dot_

 you called for building _meta_end_dot_

 huckabee yes _meta_end_dot_

 wallace _meta_end_dot_

 a border fence for cracking down on employers for telling illegals to go home _meta_end_dot_

 but last year in an interview you said something somewhat different _meta_end_dot_

 you said this i think that the rational approach is to find a way to give people a pathway to citizenship governor in your new plan the only path is to go home and to get on the back of the line which of course would mean years of waiting _meta_end_dot_

 why the change _meta_end_question_

 huckabee well i don t think there s an inconsistency _meta_end_dot_

 when i said a pathway i didn t say what the pathway was _meta_end_dot_

 i now believe that the only thing the american people are going to accept and frankly the only thing that really makes sense is a pathway that sends people back to the starting point _meta_end_dot_

 but this idea of the waiting years no i don t agree with that _meta_end_dot_

 in fact look if we can get a credit card application done within hours if we can get passports done within days if we can transact business over the internet any place in the world within seconds do a background check instantaneously it s our government that has failed and is dysfunctional _meta_end_dot_

 it shouldn t take years to get a work permit to come here and pick lettuce _meta_end_dot_

 so part of the plan that i have is that we seal the borders _meta_end_dot_

 you don t have amnesty and sanctuary cities _meta_end_dot_

 you do have a pathway that gets you back home _meta_end_dot_

 but that pathway to get back here legally doesn t take years _meta_end_dot_

 it would take days maybe weeks and then people could come back in the workforce _meta_end_dot_

 what charmaine said and incidentally this is what i thought he meant in the first place was that huckabee was moving on from talking about amnesty into talking about how his plan will deal with speeding up the legal immigration process _meta_end_dot_

 that s the last part of the _meta_number_ref_th plank of his plan _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 modernize the process of legal immigration eliminate the visa lottery system and the admission category for adult brothers and sisters of u s _meta_end_dot_

 citizens _meta_end_dot_

 increase visas for highly skilled and highly educated applicants _meta_end_dot_

 expedite processing for those who serve honorably in the u s _meta_end_dot_

 armed forces _meta_end_dot_

 improve our immigration process so that those patiently and responsibly seeking to come here legally will not have to wait decades to share in the american dream _meta_end_dot_

 governor huckabee has always been grateful to live in a country that people are trying to break into rather than break out of _meta_end_dot_

 also she said that claims that minuteman founder jim gilchrist is considering withdrawing his endorsement are not true _meta_end_dot_

 to the contrary she said gilchrist will be campaigning with them in iowa _meta_end_dot_
