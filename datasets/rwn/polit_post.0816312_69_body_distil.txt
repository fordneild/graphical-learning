  i understand what a pain in the behind it is to moderate the comments on your website _meta_end_dot_

 heck there are people with absolutely no lives who spend hours every day trying get around bans so they can get posts up on rwn that will be deleted in an hour or two _meta_end_dot_

 but i m not running for president of the united states _meta_end_dot_

 on the other hand john mccain is running for president and the comment section of his website is teeming with left wing idiots who think it s hilarious to make idiots of themselves in the comments section _meta_end_dot_

 of course it could be worse it could be obama s website which is overrun with _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ truth blogs marxists and terrorist sympathizers but still mccain s blog should have screened out this sort of trash from his comments section these comments along with a gazillion tired ball jokes are from an item called the father s day mccain golf pack being sold on mccain s website fantastic balls johnny i was so surprised to see your balls here _meta_end_dot_

 i thought the president kept them for you _meta_end_dot_

 i have a question though _meta_end_dot_

 if you think torture is a good way to gather important information what was the important info you gave up while you were being tortured _meta_end_dot_

 did it help the enemy at the time _meta_end_question_

 love ya see ya on the links johnny cakes divot tools divot tools are just what i need to repair the blast dents in my unarmored humvee _meta_end_dot_

 thanks mr _meta_end_dot_

 mccain don t know what i d do without this _meta_end_dot_

 what do ya call _meta_number_ref_ white guys chasin _meta_number_ref_ black guy _meta_end_question_

 the pga tour balls with dimples no lotion needed these are great white balls i for one am glad that john mccain supports these balls _meta_end_dot_

 the only problem is that you can t lie with these balls once you do some guy who looks and sounds like the emperor from star wars corrects you on camera _meta_end_dot_

 also i m glad to see john mccain persevere and support a game that requires arms to be raised above shoulders to play _meta_end_dot_

 i know that john mccain will be a great president since that this great country will be regulated down to his vp since he ll have to take regular matlock breaks and with the on set of alzheimers causing him to screw up leaders of different countries it ll be like a new president every day _meta_end_exclamation_

 johnny mac had better get a handle on his comments section or you ll have liberals on there claiming to be mccain supporters and dropping n bombs left and right _meta_end_dot_

 next thing you know the front page of every liberal paper in america will read mccain s supporters use racist attacks hat tip to the democratic underground which is where i ran across this link _meta_end_dot_
