  oh yeah this kid is going to be spending a lot and i mean a lot of time in therapy the issue of being transgender usually pops up with students in high school _meta_end_dot_

 now a second grade colorado boy wants to dress as a girl and be addressed with a girl s name _meta_end_dot_

 the student had attended this same school in years prior but had left to go to classes in another district for about two years _meta_end_dot_

 dave m _meta_end_dot_

 thinks classmates will recognize the change _meta_end_dot_

 i do think that there s going to be an acknowledgment that why are you in a dress this year when you were in pants last year dave said _meta_end_dot_

 wong says teachers are planning to address the student by name instead of using he or she the child will not use the regular boys or girls bathroom _meta_end_dot_

 instead two unisex bathrooms in the building will be made available _meta_end_dot_

 the school is handing out packets to parents who have questions _meta_end_dot_

 the packets contain information about people who are transgender _meta_end_dot_

 i think it is unusual said wong _meta_end_dot_

 it s something we haven t had discussions about before _meta_end_dot_

 it s something that we haven t maybe really had to think about before but now we will family therapist larry curry hopes the child and the child s parents are seeing a counselor just to be safe _meta_end_dot_

 i am very concerned because with the guidelines in place this is a very early age said curry _meta_end_dot_

 i don t know too many parents who are equipped to answer that kind of question or deal with it without some other support kim pearson says the family is getting support _meta_end_dot_

 she is the executive director of a national organization called transyouth family advocates _meta_end_dot_

 the group has been working with the family and douglas county schools _meta_end_dot_

 initially there was a lot of resistance said pearson _meta_end_dot_

 now their position is they want this child to be safe in their school pearson says their group is working with an increasing number of families nationwide who have elementary age transgender kids _meta_end_dot_

 we know that families are more comfortable talking about this she said _meta_end_dot_

 there was no place for parents to go pearson says children as young as five years old are realizing their true gender identity and her group wants to help parents who may be resisting the acceptance of this _meta_end_dot_

 setting aside the fact that people who have sex change operations are mentally disturbed and that you can no more change your gender than you can change from a human being into a hippopotamus a kid in _meta_number_ref_nd grade is just too young to have this done _meta_end_dot_

 and worse yet to do this to the kid and then put him back in school with people who know him that is horrific _meta_end_dot_

 i don t care how much literature you give these kids and their parents this kid will always be a weird freak to most of them _meta_end_dot_

 how many friends is this kid going to have in school _meta_end_question_

 is he ever going to get to go out on a date _meta_end_question_

 is he ever going to have any kind of a normal life _meta_end_question_

 to make this sort of decision for a kid at that age a decision that will have incredibly negative ramifications is morally wrong should be condemned in the strongest of terms and should actually be illegal _meta_end_dot_
