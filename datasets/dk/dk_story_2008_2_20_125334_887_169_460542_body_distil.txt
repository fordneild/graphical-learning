  this is almost too drastic to believe _meta_end_dot_

 that s down from a _meta_percent_ref_ approval just last month in this same poll so it s possible there s some massive error _meta_end_dot_

 or it could just be that campaign season has shown people the alternative _meta_end_dot_

 john mccain should be very very frightened since he s running for bush s third term _meta_end_dot_
