  and there in a nutshell is the presidency of george w _meta_end_dot_

 bush _meta_end_dot_

 there are facts and then there are the facts _meta_end_dot_

 holding his first press conference in seven weeks bush took the podium to scold congress apparently for not seeing facts as he does _meta_end_dot_

 but the press corps chose to focus on the facts in the new national intelligence estimate nie that says that iran halted its nuclear weapons program four years ago _meta_end_dot_

 now most people think that this undercuts the administration s argument that iran poses an imminent peril to the world and that ignoring the threat could lead to world war iii _meta_end_dot_

 au contraire says mr _meta_end_dot_

 bush after months of warnings that iran is another mushroom cloud just waiting to happen it turns out that the war on knowledge has begun _meta_end_dot_

 of course the question people are now asking is when did george bush become aware of the contents of this nie _meta_end_question_

 according to bush so last august someone maybe his director of national intelligence maybe someone emptying the trash mentioned some new information about the number one threat to the world but they didn t tell him what it was _meta_end_dot_

 hard to believe isn t it _meta_end_question_

 one of the reporters seemed equally skeptical let s see what national security advisor stephen hadley had to say yesterday but no nobody ever told him that _meta_end_dot_

 just another example of the facts as george bush sees them _meta_end_dot_
