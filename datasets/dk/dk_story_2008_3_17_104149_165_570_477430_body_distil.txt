  bias in the so called liberal media is not exactly breaking news _meta_end_dot_

 but you d have to go back eight years to the media painting al gore as a serial liar while giving george bush the he s my buddy he s my pal treatment to find the blatant bias that we are seeing today in the treatment of the jeremiah wright story _meta_end_dot_

 don t get me wrong _meta_end_dot_

 the remarks made by the minister of the leading democratic candidate for the presidency are certainly newsworthy _meta_end_dot_

 in a perfect world wright s words would lead to a broader discussion on race in america but we re talking about the political world so the focus will remain on the political ramifications _meta_end_dot_

 but with obama s immediate response disassociating himself from wright and the fact that the election is eight months out the damage will be minimal _meta_end_dot_

 sure it will provide fodder for the rightwingnutosphere althought it might screw up their obama is a muslim strategy and cable news talking heads will tsk tsk whenever the subject of obama and religion comes up but beyond that america is ready for its next missing white woman _meta_end_dot_

 but let s not let the media off the hook here _meta_end_dot_

 back in _meta_number_ref_ john w _meta_end_dot_

 mccain had an unintended moment of honesty and said and ever since mccain has shamelessly tried to disassociate himself from his own words while the media helpfully looks the other way _meta_end_dot_

 he mended fences with jerry falwell abandoned his own religion now pretending to be a baptist and he proudly accepted the endorsement of john hagee a man who not only called the catholic church the great whore who conspired with hitler to exterminate jews but who believes hurricane katrina was a righteous punishment sent to the people of new orleans for their sins _meta_end_dot_

 and there s another endorsement mccain received that has been flying under the radar _meta_end_dot_

 last month mccain who is rod parsley _meta_end_question_

 an ohio pastor whose _meta_dollor_ref_ million ministry s finances is cloaked in secrecy a man who sells covenant swords and prayer cloths that he claims will bring freedom from financial problems as well as any physical or emotional ailments a man who calls himself a high priest who only has to blow in a whistle to have every demon is coming off your shoulders outta your mind outta your finances and who wants to restore godly presence in government and culture and will tear down the church state wall then he really gets crazy _meta_end_dot_

 says parsley of course this does go a long ways in explaining parsley s support for bush s third term _meta_end_dot_

 after all mccain does want to stay in iraq for _meta_number_ref_ years and as everyone knows crusades aren t won overnight _meta_end_dot_

 but it is good to know that mccain s spiritual guide wants to wipe out an entire religion so we can fulfill out divine purpose _meta_end_dot_

 who knew _meta_end_question_

 certainly not the media _meta_end_dot_

 it s amazing really _meta_end_dot_

 john mccain seeks out and embraces the support of men who in the name of god accuse catholics of aiding in the holocaust who think that the victims of hurricane katrina got what they deserved and who advocate wiping out more than a billion muslims and it is all ignored _meta_end_dot_

 such is the life of a media darling _meta_end_dot_
