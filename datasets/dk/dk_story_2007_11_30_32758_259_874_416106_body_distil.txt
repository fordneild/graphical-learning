  watching the republican debates is proving a surreal experience _meta_end_dot_

 the feeling is like watching _meta_end_dot_

 well a science experiment i guess would be the best way to put it _meta_end_dot_

 all of the republicans involved seem to be devolving into crude caricatures of republicanism but different crude caricatures of republicanism something a bit more surreal than mere pandering _meta_end_dot_

 it is as if modern republicanism was pushed through an ideological prism and each of its parts scattered onto a different podium at a different part of the stage _meta_end_dot_

 romney the ceo republican _meta_end_dot_

 the multimillionaire whose interest is an america secured for the financial goals of multimillionaires _meta_end_dot_

 the problems of the little people are nothing give them a little verbal bread by appealing to a few of their baser instincts guantanamo good _meta_end_exclamation_

 terrorism bad _meta_end_exclamation_

 torture good and the republican party leadership can play the public like puppets on strings _meta_end_dot_

 romney stands out for being the republican whose social and foreign policy stances are most transparently a put on someone who seems happy to drift along saying pretty much whatever the staffers say he should say if it allows him to move on without incident _meta_end_dot_

 huckabee the religious republican _meta_end_dot_

 the perfect embodiment of true republican religion sings to the majesty of a jesus that has been painstakingly repainted in the republicans own image scrubbed of inconvenient tendencies towards compassion _meta_end_dot_

 huckabee does not know if jesus would support the death penalty _meta_end_dot_

 he does not know if torture is anti christian enough to really make a big fuss over _meta_end_dot_

 he considers himself the most christian candidate but mere self proclaimed knowledge of the holy will of god is not sufficient enough to go against the republican edicts against the poor and sick that define his party _meta_end_dot_

 republicanism is a stronger religion on that stage than christianity will ever be and reagan a more heralded messiah when it comes to huckabee facing the phalanx of fervently religious republican voters that will oppose him if he steps too carelessly on their own agendas jesus will have to make do as usual with a bit of vapid praise and little else _meta_end_dot_

 giuliani the crime boss republican _meta_end_dot_

 giuliani s primary motivation in government has always been the consolidation of his own power the use of that power to retaliate against his enemies and apparently herculean efforts to organize his city around best satisfying his own desires and needs and genitalia _meta_end_dot_

 and all of it sold to the public under constant assertions of danger of terror and imminent death if his edicts are questioned _meta_end_dot_

 he represents mafia don republicanism as perfected by karl rove delay cheney and countless others and is the most craven issuer of the bluntly stated threat let me and my republican associates and my republican petty whims go unimpeded or something will happen to you or your family _meta_end_dot_

 tancredo hunter the bigots _meta_end_dot_

 nativism and racism writ large the southern strategy recast to draw from and stoke fear resentment and loathing not against black americans now protected too well for such rank hatreds to be openly expressed but against brown americans _meta_end_dot_

 bigotry against minorities is still perfectly acceptable and in fact craved by the republican base the targets however have had to shift as each previously assaulted group has won their own civil rights _meta_end_dot_

 so now the attack moves to gay americans yes but most especially to hispanics thinly veiled under pretenses of rampant and dangerous illegality gotta have someone to hate _meta_end_dot_

 gotta have have some group somewhere that supposedly threatens the very social fabric of america by having the audacity to wish to be treated as human _meta_end_dot_

 what if insert group here moves next door or marries your daughter or gets on the same elevator as you _meta_end_question_

 how many american laws must be changed or created or ignored in order to prevent such a terror from happening _meta_end_question_

 thompson the vacuum packed professional republican _meta_end_dot_

 chosen by name alone not skill and specifically picked to be well known and inoffensive with no particular record agenda skills or ideas that might get in the way _meta_end_dot_

 the goal of the handpicked vacuum packed republican whether it be fred thompson arnold schwarzenegger or anyone else is for their name to quickly provide enough boost to make their actual statements and positions irrelevant _meta_end_dot_

 unfortunately for his party backers thompson has proved to have the political vibrancy of a dead halibut thus defeating himself handily in his only area of purported accomplishment _meta_end_dot_

 ron paul the to hell with the rest of you republican _meta_end_dot_

 the rejector of the base premises of government itself _meta_end_dot_

 paul represents the large portion of the republican party that condemns the very notion that government should have a role in bettering the health education or welfare of its citizens _meta_end_dot_

 under the republican faux libertarianism that finds its current crown princes in figures like grover norquist and ron paul government can indeed be ably used as an enforcing tool of bigotry but not of tolerance government can indeed be used as a valid tool of industry against citizenry but not the reverse government most of all is a failure by its mere existence unless it serves their own thinly drawn purposes of course _meta_end_dot_

 it is the shallowest and most crass interpretation possible of societal good and indeed of civilization which goes to explain why it is so popular among certain groups _meta_end_dot_

 w hile not one of the current republican candidates are eager to utter george bush s name he is after all badly damaged goods since he had the misfortune to put republican ideas into practice and be branded with the now obvious results there have been absolutely no attempts whatsoever to distance themselves from either those ideas or those results _meta_end_dot_

 on the contrary it has just been broken up into discrete portions every one of them seeking dominance over the others _meta_end_dot_

 it is as if all the failures and corruptions of principle of george bush has been cleaved into parts each one of them reaching an even more extreme level in one or another of those seeking to succeed him _meta_end_dot_

 would you like the religious panderer bush or the fiscally incompetent bush _meta_end_question_

 would you prefer the bush that uses the crudely drawn specter of terrorism as distraction from every issue and act no matter how seemingly petty or unconnected _meta_end_question_

 would you like the bush that turns all aspects of government into crap or the bush that uses his position as a tribal lord meting out punishments to all those that oppose him and lucrative positions and benefits to all those that maintain their loyalty _meta_end_question_

 you have a choice each one is represented onstage _meta_end_dot_

 and why should that be surprising _meta_end_question_

 it is after all the fabric of republicanism _meta_end_dot_

 these are the things that get applause when spoken from their podiums the crude the insincere the blasphemous the hateful even the condemnation of the tasks of government themselves _meta_end_dot_

 large portions of america cheer for these things and surely those portions of america need a political party too _meta_end_dot_

 if anything though it s going to be fascinating to watch which portion of this spectrum proves the most powerful in the party _meta_end_dot_

 will it be the racism _meta_end_question_

 the oligarchical premises of rank and privilege _meta_end_question_

 the claims of christianity divorced of any actual requirement to behave in a christian fashion _meta_end_question_

 the damn everyone but me movement is alive and well but which precise form will it take _meta_end_question_

 which part of the schizophrenic republican personality will prove most dominant at the end of primary season _meta_end_question_

 and what will it take to stitch the various frankensteinian parts back together into something again vaguely presentable to the nation come the general election _meta_end_question_

 update my goodness i forgot mccain the warmonger republican _meta_end_dot_

 in my defense it s only because everyone has forgotten mccain _meta_end_dot_

 he is still running right and not just as a foil to ron paul _meta_end_question_
