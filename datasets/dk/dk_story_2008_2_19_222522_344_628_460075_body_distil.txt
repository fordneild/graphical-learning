  wisconsin independents were drawn to mccain s maverickness like moths to a flame a dull flickering flame in a brightly lit room update dane county madison has only reported _meta_percent_ref_ so should be worth another _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ vote margin for obama since he s winning it _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 obama s victory should edge closer to _meta_number_ref_ points before the count is complete _meta_end_dot_

 oh and milwaukee is less than half counted at _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 obama leads _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ there _meta_end_dot_
