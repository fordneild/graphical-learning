  for the first time ever the epa has turned down a request for a waiver so that california can set its own regulations on auto emissions as it s authorized to do under the clean air act _meta_end_dot_

 in a hastily assembled after hours press conference the epa declared that the energy bill signed by bush yesterday was much better than a patchwork of state laws even though the energy bill was much weaker than the california proposals and does not directly address greenhouse gases _meta_end_dot_

 once again the republicans demonstrate their absolute disdain for any authority being given to the states and their love of centralizing all power under one man _meta_end_dot_

 state s rights _meta_end_question_

 in turning down california s request epa administrator stephen johnson rolled out the next phase of the republican zeno s paradox plan for ignoring global warming _meta_end_dot_

 california said johnson wasn t the right place to deal with this because it s really a national issue _meta_end_dot_

 of course the nation can t deal with this issue because it s really an international issue _meta_end_dot_

 and of course the other nations of the world aren t ready to do this exactly as we d like so _meta_end_dot_

 california can t deal with this _meta_end_dot_

 no one can move until everyone does _meta_end_dot_

 this ruling comes despite a recent series of court rulings in which california has won at every stage _meta_end_dot_

 and the ruling will surely result in another series of court battles to push through the regulations california set in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 the bush administration knows that it has absolutely no legal ground to stand on and that california is completely within the rights granted the state under the law _meta_end_dot_

 of course neither the law or the environment has ever been a consideration at the bush epa _meta_end_dot_

 california is experiencing drought wild fires reduced snow pack all things that we might have started to address years ago had the bush administration not done everything possible to slow the process _meta_end_dot_

 and with another _meta_number_ref_ states ready to adopt the california standards the patchwork consists of only two _meta_number_ref_ patches _meta_end_dot_

 but what are lives facts and the future next to an opportunity to reward to the right s corporate pals _meta_end_question_

 update _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ by devilstower an investigation of the epa decision and chairman henry waxman has ordered the epa to preserve all documents related to the decision _meta_end_dot_
