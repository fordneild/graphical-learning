  six months have passed since i told you that a year had passed since i told you you weren t getting your oversight _meta_end_dot_

 and you re not _meta_end_dot_

 because rahm emanuel says so only guess what _meta_end_question_

 the message on iraq and fisa and these subpoenas is all the same george w _meta_end_dot_

 bush thinks there are no congressional checks and balances against his inherent powers if congress legislates limits on his eavesdropping schemes he ll veto them so says chuck schumer s new pal michael wrong on torture but still kinda ok mukasey _meta_end_dot_

 if they mandate withdrawal of troops from iraq he ll defy it not veto defy _meta_end_dot_

 if they subpoena his staff and demand answers he ll block it _meta_end_dot_

 but rahm emanuel thinks the bush administration s blanket insistence on unchecked executive power can and should be split up into bite sized chunks that the american public can safely ignore _meta_end_dot_

 each front in the bush cheney war on our constitutional system of government ought to be considered in isolation from the rest so that they can be swept under the rug quietly in discrete and manageable news cycles _meta_end_dot_

 but with a paper trail of press releases objecting to each fresh outrage so that the historical record appears to register dissent or at least he hopes so so that he can trade the long term viability of the constitutional system of government for a strategy he believes will result in more seats in a branch that s got no game plan for preserving its power _meta_end_dot_

 more seats at the kiddie table _meta_end_dot_

 the iraq fight is the fisa fight is the subpoena fight _meta_end_dot_

 chairman conyers wants it _meta_end_dot_

 nancy pelosi wants it _meta_end_dot_

 even steny hoyer looks like he wants it _meta_end_dot_

 but somehow rahm emanuel s kiddie table seating chart carries the day _meta_end_dot_
