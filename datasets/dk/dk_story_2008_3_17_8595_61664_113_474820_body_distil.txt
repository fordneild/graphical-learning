  it s not just the netroots who are up in arms about the fact that key south florida incumbents debbie wasserman schultz and kendrick meek are refusing to support fellow dems annette taddeo joe garcia and raul martinez _meta_end_dot_

 local democrats are outraged too fortunately party leaders in the area are having absolutely no trouble getting behind our three excellent candidates but rather than upbraid wasserman schultz and meek for their embarrassing attempts to recuse themselves from these vital races the dccc has signalled its assent how utterly dismaying _meta_end_dot_

 anyone who has read the thumpin knows how bitterly rahm emanuel fought against this insulting practice _meta_end_dot_

 attitudes like meek s and wasserman schultz s were one reason the dems languished in the minority for twelve years and if they aren t curbed now will be a reason we don t expand our majority _meta_end_dot_

 what s more meek dws sit in totally safe districts _meta_end_dot_

 in debbie s home base of fl _meta_number_ref_ voters chose kerry over bush by _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ in the last election _meta_end_dot_

 meanwhile in meek s fl _meta_number_ref_ kerry was favored by an almost hilarious _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ margin _meta_end_dot_

 so the idea that dws and meek could possibly be doing what s best for them and their constituents by kneecapping strong challengers and damaging the democratic party s prospects is totally ludicrous _meta_end_dot_

 as i ve said before and as i won t stop saying debbie wasserman schultz either has to completely change her tune on this and vocally embrace our challengers or step down from the dccc _meta_end_dot_

 and for his part kendrick meek should do the same _meta_end_dot_

 south florida democrats and the whole party deserve nothing less _meta_end_dot_
