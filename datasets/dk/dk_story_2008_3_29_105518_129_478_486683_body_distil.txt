  yesterday you blew away our goal of _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ donations for blue majority candidates but since we ve got until the end of the month monday to close out the quarter we set a new goal of _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ contributions per candidate focusing on getting rick noriega dan seals gary trauner joe garcia and leslie byrne over the _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ contibutor hump _meta_end_dot_

 last night we got there with seals so now it s time to push the others over _meta_end_dot_

 demonstrating a broad base of support garnering a large number of small donors is almost as important in this quarter as the total amount raised _meta_end_dot_

 it sends a strong message to big donors to the dccc and to the republicans _meta_end_dot_

 it helps scare away republican opponents like in the case of dan maffei in ny _meta_number_ref_ where the republicans just can t scare up a strong candidate for the open seat _meta_end_dot_

 that s what happened this year when wyoming s barbara cubin was scared away from running against gary trauner again because he came so close to beating her in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 donating now is also a chance to reward candidates stepping out on critical issues _meta_end_dot_

 for instance leslie byrne is among the blue majority candidates who have endorsed the responsible plan for iraq an effort that is gaining more and more coverage from the traditional media _meta_end_dot_

 or you have joe garcia in fl _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ taking on the corrupt center for a free cuba _meta_end_dot_

 the other thing that lots of donations from us does is as markos has argued is offset the need for money from those other less small d democratic sources _meta_end_dot_

 every one of these candidates will fulfill our goal of more and better democrats _meta_end_dot_

 we won t help just anyone who attaches a d to their name anymore we ve shifted focus from the unqualified more to the critical better part of that equation and byrne trauner garcia and noriega fit the bill _meta_end_dot_

 help get these candidates over the _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ donation hurdle and that much closer to a seat in congress in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_
