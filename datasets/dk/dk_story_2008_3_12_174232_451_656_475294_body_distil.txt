  kudos again to house democrats who continue to actually consider things carefully and gasp _meta_end_exclamation_

 ask questions about george w _meta_end_dot_

 bush s still unexplained and ultimately nonsensical demand that congress usurp the role of the judiciary on behalf of an out of control executive that can t do its own dirty work for once and grant retroactive amnesty from suit to the telecom corporations that in a great act of patriotism knuckled under to the administration and agreed to spy on you for pay _meta_end_dot_

 every time congressional dems actually slow down and take stock of the situation from senator chris dodd s brave and lonely and seemingly futile stand to the cautious maneuvering of house dems today new revelations arise that should make all americans who value our freedoms glad they did _meta_end_dot_

 the house has appeared on the brink of caving to bush s petulant demands more than a few times in recent weeks only to step back and reassess things when they realized that this program like any program launched by the bush administration would likely operate totally unsupervised _meta_end_dot_

 indeed no other conclusion was possible for anyone watching the contortions and stonewalling in the case of the us attorneys and white house e mail investigations _meta_end_dot_

 then it was word from whistleblower babak pasdar who revealed to wired that then the wall street journal s discovery of the undead zombie status of the total information awareness program _meta_end_dot_

 how s that for power of the purse by the way _meta_end_question_

 kill a program only to find it vaporize and recondense in a different form in a different part of the budget another few days taken to think things through rationally as opposed to peeing our pants in fear and what do you know _meta_end_question_

 turns out the administration has already gone over the cliff on erasing the lines between domestic and foreign spying and is vacuuming up unprecedented amounts of personal data on _meta_end_dot_

 well you _meta_end_dot_

 and who s sifting through your data _meta_end_question_

 why it s the fbi _meta_end_dot_

 only the agency that just can t seem to keep its nose out of your drawers no matter what laws we put in their way _meta_end_dot_

 so another reconsideration of the facts has shed still more light on the brazen whitewashing that is the bush cheney gang s demand for amnesty _meta_end_dot_

 and it really should derail fisa again _meta_end_dot_

 every time we get close to finally having to roll over another day s delay brings another revelation of how ridiculously the administration has overstepped on surveillance _meta_end_dot_

 it brings to mind the group markos noted yesterday that almost ended up with both eliot spitzer and geraldine ferraro speaking at their event just before they each individually blew up _meta_end_dot_

 every time the congress seems ready to give in on fisa we find out more about how crazy bush is the deal falls apart and the constitution wins back a few inches of turf _meta_end_dot_

 today the house is expected to vote on much improved language that probably only became possible thanks to the slow drip revelations of just how unwarranted this retroactive amnesty is just how far out of control the administration has already gotten on surveillance and just how impossible they ll make it to effectively monitor them on it _meta_end_dot_

 and today s vote won t be the end of the process either since more reconciliation with the senate s hasty acceptance of amnesty lies ahead _meta_end_dot_

 but with a house recess coming up we may yet learn more _meta_end_dot_

 hell the way things are going with two weeks we may yet find out bush is bugging the dnc _meta_end_dot_
