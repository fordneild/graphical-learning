  earlier this afternoon the page posted an anonymously sourced headline stating a little vaguely that several senior clinton campaign staff are now voluntarily going without pay _meta_end_dot_

 campaign manager patti solis doyle was the only staffer identified _meta_end_dot_

 now nbc says it has confirmed the story _meta_end_dot_

 this comes right on the heels of the revelation that clinton loaned _meta_dollor_ref_ million of her own money to her campaign in january _meta_end_dot_

 the clinton campaign also sent out a fundraising appeal today that carried just a whiff of desperation as we saw with giuliani when presidential candidates decide to get in touch with the working poor by surrounding themselves with unpaid staff that can be a sign of a campaign s impending collapse _meta_end_dot_
