  dennis hastert gave a strange farewell speech today that s not strange _meta_end_dot_

 that s just laughable because it s coming from the guy who was the frontman for indicted former majority leader tom delay _meta_end_dot_

 what s strange is that he gave a farewell speech but he claims to have not yet determined when he s going to resign _meta_end_dot_

 but this is what sticks out for me from a partisan standpoint i won t complain about hastert resigning because it gives us an opportunity to possibly pick up a republican seat in a special election _meta_end_dot_

 but what kind of public servant just resigns for no good reason leaving his constituents without representation for several months and possibly costing the taxpayers a bunch of money to conduct a special election _meta_end_question_

 if hastert didn t want to serve a full term he shouldn t have run for reelection _meta_end_dot_

 obviously he s not interested in serving his constituents as a member of congress or he d stick out the full term _meta_end_dot_

 maybe instead of prattling on about civility in politics he should have pondered the concept of duty _meta_end_dot_

 update dmsilev points out that hastert is probably waiting to resign until it s too late to add his race to the february _meta_number_ref_th primary ballot _meta_end_dot_

 obama would bring out a huge dem turnout helping dems possibly win the seat _meta_end_dot_

 instead he ll probably wait long enough that a special election will have to be called for that race only costing the taxpayers of his district hundreds of thousands if not millions of dollars to conduct an unscheduled election _meta_end_dot_

 we probably shouldn t expect much else from the guy who helped george w _meta_end_dot_

 bush turn a budget surplus in to a huge deficit _meta_end_dot_
