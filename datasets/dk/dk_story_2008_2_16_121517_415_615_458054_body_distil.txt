  obama may be getting an extra delegate or two in new york _meta_end_dot_

 there were also some districts in which clinton received zero votes _meta_end_dot_

 it s being currently chalked up to human error _meta_end_dot_

 and really if you want to be devious and steal some precincts you don t do it by sticking a _meta_number_ref_ in one of the candidate s columns _meta_end_dot_

 that s a tad bit obvious _meta_end_dot_

 and the problems are being caught and corrected so no need to hyperventilate _meta_end_dot_

 that paragraph sort of implies that the voting machines don t spit out paper ballots _meta_end_question_

 that should be sop for these things _meta_end_dot_
