 laura _meta_end_exclamation_

 in our continuing series yes we re all staring at you which just won the _meta_number_ref_ bipm award from the bipm foundation of which i am the non partisan executive director we put front pager miss laura in the hot seat for a grillin _meta_end_dot_

 caution she s feisty _meta_end_dot_

 you were born in late _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 do you have any regrets about missing america s golden age the ford years _meta_end_question_

 what attracted you to blogging and how long have you been doing it _meta_end_question_

 here _meta_end_dot_

 you are currently the mellon fellow in sociology at dartmouth _meta_end_dot_

 what does that mean and what is your favorite kind of melon _meta_end_question_

 what kind of music makes you feel invincible to the gop horde _meta_end_question_

 sacred harp no harps involved _meta_end_dot_

 it s been an ongoing tradition in the southern us since before the civil war and i often go to alabama and sing this music with people who include many quite conservative republicans _meta_end_dot_

 one of the things my dissertation and now book manuscript focuses on is that people can find a meaningful community in this singing despite those political differences and equivalent religious ones _meta_end_dot_

 so i guess i rarely feel more invincible than when i m in a little country church on sand mountain singing about god with people who i might see as part of the gop horde if i didn t know them and love them dearly _meta_end_dot_

 sacred harp isn t really listening music though and i listen to country rock folk _meta_end_dot_

 i most like voices with texture and depth _meta_end_dot_

 probably my two favorite voices belong to kasey chambers and tim eriksen _meta_end_dot_

 in a small folk club once i swear to you i felt the pressure on my skin from the sound waves of tim s unamplified voice _meta_end_dot_

 one song i could listen to for hours at a time is easy silence the dixie chicks version is great of course and then recently i found the version by dan wilson who wrote the song with them and now i can just alternate between them _meta_end_dot_

 what s the one book every kossack must read _meta_end_question_

 i reviewed jacob hacker s the great risk shift which is a really important one to read _meta_end_dot_

 thomas geoghegan s which side are you on _meta_end_question_

 trying to be for labor when it s flat on its back _meta_end_dot_

 but i d also say annette lareau s unequal childhoods class race and family life or arlie hochschild s the second shift because understanding how people raise their children and handle their marriages is a really important component of understanding our society and culture and ok i m in the middle of prepping a sociology of the family class _meta_end_dot_

 and i d say pride and prejudice or elinor lipman s the inn at lake devine _meta_end_dot_

 finish this sentence in the kitchen i make a mean _meta_end_dot_

 now that it s been officially announced that susang is the new senior executive viceroy editor in chief the new decider if you will of daily kos would you say the other front pagers are resentful or are they perhaps just so beaten down that they really don t care _meta_end_question_

 what do you do for fun when you re not blogging _meta_end_question_

 which congressional senatorial races are you watching most closely _meta_end_question_

 blue hampshire _meta_end_dot_

 at daily kos i try to keep a bunch of the blue majority races in people s minds i tend to end up getting interested in those races because i m writing about them rather than the reverse _meta_end_dot_

 and i keep an eye on two big house pickup opportunities in michigan mark schauer in mi _meta_number_ref_ and gary peters in mi _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 what has surprised you most since you started writing for the front page _meta_end_question_

 on the sometimes frustrating side how much more difficult it is to find time to relax and have fun in the threads _meta_end_dot_

 when i m on the site i feel like i should be doing something being useful in some way _meta_end_dot_

 no waffling here dogs or cats _meta_end_question_

 what are your favorite blogs besides daily kos _meta_end_question_

 atrios the phil nugent experience swing state project crooked timber go fug yourself project rungay which trapper john and his wife just told me about so i m still wasting too much time going through the archives and another thing katha pollitt s blot at the nation carpetbagger report lots of local blogs i could go on and on _meta_end_dot_

 yes or no the democratic nominee will be determined at the democratic national convention _meta_end_question_

 i have one question left but i gotta feed the meter _meta_end_dot_
