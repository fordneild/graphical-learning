  in another sign of obama s gathering momentum the teamsters and boilermakers unions are endorsing him _meta_end_dot_

 as dhinmi explained of the significance of other recent union endorsements wisconsin is done it s already less than two weeks to ohio and texas and by now obama looks likely to be the nominee _meta_end_dot_

 but further union support could materially help him lock things up with a strong performance in ohio which is more than _meta_percent_ref_ unionized _meta_end_dot_

 and even the cynical view that this is bandwagon jumping reveals the widespread belief that obama will be the nominee _meta_end_dot_

 meanwhile at least these unions have thus far avoided repeating rightwing slurs of hillary clinton and her supporters in choosing barack obama _meta_end_dot_
