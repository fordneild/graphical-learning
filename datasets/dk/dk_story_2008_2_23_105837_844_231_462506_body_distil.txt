  let s face it _meta_end_dot_

 the democratic leadership council has never gotten a lot of love around here _meta_end_dot_

 no surprise there _meta_end_dot_

 when your philosophy of governance sucks that much ass and you lose every election you contest on its tenets you re just not going to get love from a community that s come together to find ways for democrats to win _meta_end_dot_

 it s just not gonna happen _meta_end_dot_

 but through it all the dlc always at least pretended that the d meant something _meta_end_dot_

 then they put harold ford at the helm and it all fell apart _meta_end_dot_

 via my left nutmeg we bring you ford s suicide note yes that s right _meta_end_dot_

 harold ford thinks the guy who thinks blackwater is perfect is the best congressman in washington _meta_end_dot_

 of course ford s perspective isn t exactly first hand is it _meta_end_question_

 after all ford isn t actually in washington is he _meta_end_question_

 that s one of the little known side effects that comes from losing your election _meta_end_dot_

 oh i think i m going to be sick _meta_end_dot_

 wait _meta_end_dot_

 maybe i m being unfair _meta_end_dot_

 after all maybe ford s business acumen and fresh new approaches to the issues could yield some interesting results _meta_end_dot_

 just what would you do as president mr _meta_end_dot_

 ford _meta_end_question_

 hey presto _meta_end_exclamation_

 problem solved _meta_end_exclamation_

 thank you seven year old harold ford _meta_end_exclamation_

 seriously there are _meta_number_ref_ different levels of stupid coming through here _meta_end_dot_

 i don t know if i can pin them all down _meta_end_dot_

 i can t go on _meta_end_dot_

 it s too depressing _meta_end_dot_

 dare i even mention the ford educational platform _meta_end_question_

 i don t know what the hell that first sentence in the second paragraph is supposed to mean exactly but we can t blame ford for that _meta_end_dot_

 although we might note the quality of coverage ford and the dlc now warrant when they do public events _meta_end_dot_

 seriously _meta_end_dot_

 look at this article but i know what that third paragraph means _meta_end_dot_

 it means it s time to vomit again _meta_end_dot_

 yes parents you really can measure your love for your children in dollars _meta_end_dot_

 harold ford no children and the dlc say it s so _meta_end_dot_

 ho _meta_end_dot_

 ly _meta_end_dot_

 crap _meta_end_dot_

 now if your head hasn t exploded yet and really why should it _meta_end_question_

 harold ford and the dlc are already dead to you most likely get ready for this wonder of wonders mr _meta_end_dot_

 merrill lynch is impressed with mr _meta_end_dot_

 goldman sachs _meta_end_dot_

 who d a thunk it _meta_end_question_

 but that ain t it _meta_end_dot_

 oh no _meta_end_dot_

 oof _meta_end_exclamation_

 spit take run barack _meta_end_exclamation_

 run for your life _meta_end_exclamation_

 ruuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuun _meta_end_exclamation_

 don t look back _meta_end_exclamation_

 run like the wind _meta_end_exclamation_

 decontaminate _meta_end_exclamation_

 burn the clothes you were wearing when i told you to run _meta_end_exclamation_

 oh my goooooooooooood _meta_end_exclamation_

 please god don t let harold ford clamber onto the back of this bandwagon now _meta_end_dot_

 obama has tried keeping the dlc at arm s length since he got to dc even having to fight them to get his name off their web site _meta_end_dot_

 the dlc is an organization specializing in grabbing credit it isn t due _meta_end_dot_

 allowing them suckerfish themselves onto what obama s managed to build for himself would be an unimaginable tragedy _meta_end_dot_

 allowing them to do it while they re also endorsing republicans for congress is a recipe for disaster _meta_end_dot_

 the same recipe the dlc has been cooking and stinking up the joint with for years _meta_end_dot_

 update lord help us it s a trend
