  the dismal reality just keeps rolling through my mind at this late hour robbing me of rest _meta_end_dot_

 our troops have to stay _meta_end_dot_

 like water spiraling down the drain and into a sewer that s where every republican canard and conservative dodge leads _meta_end_dot_

 over _meta_number_ref_ american kia thousands more maimed for life half a trillion dollars and counting no end in sight _meta_end_dot_

 but according to the mundane idiots and clever liars that got us into this disaster we are making dramatic progress like this look there are only three future possibilities and staying in iraq is the only answer the gop has for any of the three _meta_end_dot_

 forget crayons this flow chart could be drawn with a can of spray paint on a legal pad _meta_number_ref_ violence up our soldiers have to stay _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ no change petraeus explains why our troops have to stay _meta_end_dot_

 and _meta_number_ref_ if someday the violence falls to whatever arbitrary magic number is deemed acceptable can our troops finally come home _meta_end_question_

 tpm dug up this gem from the new yorker which sums up the absurdity of john mccain s answer to that one perfectly for years we ve been told that our troops can t leave until iraq is stable and secure conveniently vague conditions that crocker and petraeus were unable to define today despite repeated opportunties to do so _meta_end_dot_

 but mccain laid even that lie to rest we re going to stay in iraq no matter what for a hundred years a thousand years or ten thousand years _meta_end_dot_

 or until the republicans and their dino lackeys are kicked out of dc _meta_end_dot_
