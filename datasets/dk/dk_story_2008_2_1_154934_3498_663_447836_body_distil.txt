  a notable trend that could be significant for the eventual nomination is the african american vote _meta_end_dot_

 delegates will be awarded based on proportional votes _meta_end_dot_

 in some states a small portion of the delegates go to the winner of teh entire state but most of the delegates are awarded by congressional district _meta_end_dot_

 since many african americans are concentrated in a small number of districts even in states where clinton should win possibly even with a solid statewide margin like new york and new jersey obama should rack up delegates by running well in districts that are heavily african american _meta_end_dot_

 in new york clinton is polling well ahead of obama but he s pulling _meta_percent_ref_ of the black vote and in new jersey it s _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 obama should run the table in il and if he can win california they ll probably come out of the big states even or with him slightly ahead in delegates _meta_end_dot_

 i cant hazard to guess how thinks will play out in the smaller states _meta_end_dot_

 there s no way anyone effectively puts away the nomination on super tuesday _meta_end_dot_

 but if obama does very well a tie or better it could be the kind of blow that causes the clinton campaign s knees to buckle _meta_end_dot_

 then the next round of states includes md va dc and hi where he could possibly win huge _meta_end_dot_

 obama needs to survive february _meta_number_ref_th in decent shape _meta_end_dot_

 if he does and his money is good he should have a good remainder of february and clinton will need to survive february because there aren t many states where one would expect her to have a significant advantage _meta_end_dot_

 all of this is pointing to a momentous set of contests on march _meta_number_ref_th when ohio rhode island texas and vermont cast their ballot _meta_end_dot_

 in the meantime clinton s task is to stop obama s momentum while obama s is to keep it going to overcome clinton s leads in most of the february _meta_number_ref_th states _meta_end_dot_
