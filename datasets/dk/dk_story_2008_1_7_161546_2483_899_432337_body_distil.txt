  this is one case where a republican retirement would not be good news the blog in question is california majority report and the story has also been reported at tpm _meta_end_dot_

 since the story broke however the politico has updated with a quote from doolittle s chief of staff doolittle barely hung on in a highly favorable district last year winning just _meta_percent_ref_ to _meta_percent_ref_ and the polls were terrible for him if he stuck around _meta_end_dot_

 retiring would be the smart play for him if he cares at all about the gop retaining the seat _meta_end_dot_

 so far however his arrogance has kept him in the race and long may it continue to do so _meta_end_dot_

 our candidate is retired air force lt _meta_end_dot_

 col _meta_end_dot_

 charlie brown who ran a fine race last year and was poised to take the race against doolittle this fall _meta_end_dot_

 if doolittle does hang up his abramoff dirtied spikes one likely candidate for the gop with doolittle s rumored blessing is former state sen _meta_end_dot_

 rico oller _meta_end_dot_

 any republican not reeking of eau d abramoff as doolittle is would be a stiff challenge for brown in this district but doolittle s legacy and brown s relative popularity in the district may well enable us to win anyway particularly if doolittle successor can be tied to him as joy padgett was to bob ney _meta_end_dot_

 of course if his people are to be believed he s not going anywhere _meta_end_dot_

 and that s perfectly good news for us _meta_end_dot_
