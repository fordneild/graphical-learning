  rudy giuliani s having a tough week when it comes to his supposed strength _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 a group of firefighters and family members of _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ victims is looking into forming a _meta_number_ref_ to oppose his candidacy and the _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ candidate lost a key _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ endorsement giuliani does still have his supporters among firefighters it s just that there are some little questions about how organic that support is it s a pretty stark contrast between firefighters willing to pay to tell their negative stories about giuliani and those who need to be paid to give him a good word _meta_end_dot_

 you have to wonder how many more firefighters he ll put on the payroll to make up for the potential _meta_number_ref_ and the kean endorsement _meta_end_dot_
