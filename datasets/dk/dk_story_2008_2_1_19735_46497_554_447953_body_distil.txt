  last week harry reid talked about the stimulus package and the presidential candidates _meta_end_dot_

 the same statement certainly holds true for the fisa votes which will happen monday _meta_end_dot_

 here s what obama had to say about this vote earlier this week and here s clinton s statement statements are good but action is better _meta_end_dot_

 it s not too likely that clinton and obama will take the afternoon before super tuesday off from the campaign to do their current job not that it hurts to ask but we can ask them to do something else _meta_end_dot_

 they can ask their senate endorsers to vote for the dodd feingold amendment stripping telco amensty for the bill to vote against basket warrants or reverse targeting sequestration of illegally harvested evidence and a four year sunset _meta_end_dot_

 among the senators endorsing clinton that need to be moved on this are bayh bill nelson feinstein and whitehouse _meta_end_dot_

 obama s list includes ben nelson conrad johnson and mccaskill _meta_end_dot_

 the presidential candidates would do well to contact these senators and urge them to cast their votes in their stead _meta_end_dot_
