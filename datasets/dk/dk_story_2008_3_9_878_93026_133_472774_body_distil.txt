  illustrated by karen wehrstein daily tech critiqued here a few days ago and i decided to team up for a joint effort which we sincerely hope will be fun to read and produce interesting discussion and debate _meta_end_dot_

 mike s post will be available in the next week or so _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ at issue was the data from early _meta_number_ref_ and _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 i guess you could say it was the best of januaries it was the worst of januaries _meta_end_dot_

 the numbers on the zig zaggy black line are the deviation by month from the average global temperature for the month in question in degrees celsius source giss land sea temperature record _meta_end_dot_

 jan _meta_number_ref_ at _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ means it was twelve one hundredths of a degree warmer than the average of all the jan s _meta_end_dot_

 now jan _meta_number_ref_ at _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ degrees above the baseline is cooler than recent jans _meta_end_dot_

 you have to go all the way back to _meta_number_ref_ to find a cooler one _meta_end_dot_

 but it is warmer than the baseline that s why it s a positive _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ instead of negative _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 contrast that modest _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ increase with the _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ of jan _meta_number_ref_ one year earlier _meta_end_dot_

 jan _meta_number_ref_ is the largest and warmer divergence in the entire monthly giss record going back to _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 the steep downward slope of that blue line is much more a product of an exceptionally warmer than average jan _meta_number_ref_ than a cool er jan _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 but lines like conclusions drawn hastily between the two dressed up with headlines about record snowfall sure can look like evidence for dramatic cooling even though they re a product of record warming eh _meta_end_question_

 the green line from the jan _meta_number_ref_ record high to the average of all thirteen subsequent months is imo a better representation of the annual data _meta_end_dot_

 and if you drop off jan _meta_number_ref_ to get a true _meta_number_ref_ month metric shown in red the mountain disappears to be replaced with barely a molehill _meta_end_dot_

 but michael asked a good question one i ll address in this context why was jan _meta_number_ref_ cooler than the dozen or more january s before and why was jan _meta_number_ref_ so blasted hot it sticks out like a sore thumb _meta_end_question_
