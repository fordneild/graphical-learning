  in less than _meta_number_ref_ hours the polls will open in texas ohio rhode island and vermont and the polling suggests tight races _meta_end_dot_

 pollster com s average of ohio polls is hillary clinton _meta_number_ref_ _meta_percent_ref_ and barack obama at _meta_number_ref_ _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 their average for texas is obama _meta_number_ref_ _meta_percent_ref_ and clinton _meta_number_ref_ _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 polls are not predictors but snapshots of where the electorate is when the poll was taken _meta_end_dot_

 but as we are almost to election day they should provide a good indication of what to expect tuesday night _meta_end_dot_

 but have the polls been accurate _meta_end_question_

 everyone knows about the consistent obama lead in nh that didn t result in an obama win but a two point clinton victory _meta_end_dot_

 but what about the polls since _meta_end_question_

 an analysis of the poll results using the data at pollster com shows that clinton has generally performed consistent with the public polls while obama has consistently performed much better than the average of the public polls _meta_end_dot_

 because of the small number of polls in the sample these results can t be viewed as meeting strict standards for empirical study _meta_end_dot_

 however a few calculations suggest that there is no wilder effect aka as a bradley effect _meta_end_dot_

 in fact the variance runs in the opposite direction with obama s strength being under represented in the public polling _meta_end_dot_

 if there s any problem related to race it s probably that the turnout models are under representing africa american turnou _meta_end_dot_

 a few notes about the table below _meta_end_dot_

 i did not include caucus states as it s difficult to translate polling to caucus results _meta_end_dot_

 south carolina is included in this analysis but it s the only state where john edwards was still actively campaigning _meta_end_dot_

 for all subsequent states i ve only included polls taken after edwards dropped out _meta_end_dot_

 if there were not at least six polls taken after edwards withdrawal and for a few important states like ct and ma there were not i did not include them in the analysis _meta_end_dot_

 finally regarding california i excluded zogby polls not because they were wrong but because they were such outliers from every other poll and ended up being _meta_number_ref_ points off the final result _meta_end_dot_

 having said that there are a few observations which these figures support _meta_end_dot_

 first obama s strength among african american voters is probably being underestimated by pollsters _meta_end_dot_

 the states with the largest african american populations such as sc al and ga are where obama has outperformed the polls by the biggest margins _meta_end_dot_

 second it appears that the withdrawal of edwards has probably helped obama _meta_end_dot_

 since edwards dropped out so close to super tuesday there were many early votes for him that appear to have gone to obama in the subsequent contests _meta_end_dot_

 there s one other factor that i have not seen mentioned anywhere else the role of afscme emily s list and the american federation of teachers in supporting the clinton campaign with targeted appeals to increase the turnout of women voters _meta_end_dot_

 as i will explain in my next post this evening these three groups may very well have kept clinton from losing in new hampshire and early in the campaign where they expended great resources clinton generally either won or kept the contest close _meta_end_dot_

 but their ability to prop up hillary clinton s candidacy may be diminishing _meta_end_dot_

 if the pattern seen in these figures continues on tuesday obama will win texas and possibly ohio as well _meta_end_dot_

 and if obama wins both texas and ohio it will be a near certainty that he will be our presidential nominee _meta_end_dot_
