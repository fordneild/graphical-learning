  let s review things _meta_end_dot_

 roger simon of the politico wrote a piece in which he claimed an unnamed high ranking clinton campaign official told him the clinton campaign would be trying to flip pledged delegates those delegates awarded to a candidate based on her or his performance in a primary or caucus as distinguished from the unpledged delegates aka superdelegates who can vote for whomever they want at the convention _meta_end_dot_

 this is what simon wrote the clinton campaign now denies that they will try to flip pledged delegates from obama to clinton via greg sergeant at tpm election central to my knowledge the obama campaign had not previously made comments about going after clinton delegates _meta_end_dot_

 nonetheless this was their response to greg sergeant so here s what we have _meta_end_dot_

 roger simon wrote a piece supposedly quoting an unnamed clinton official saying they would go after obama s pledged delegates _meta_end_dot_

 in that same article simon cited phil singer note that in the original article by simon singer is asked about going after the other candidate s pledged delegates and he is not cited as saying that the clinton campaign rejects the strategy or that they have no plans to pursue such a strategy _meta_end_dot_

 however he apparently did say he assumes the obama campaign will be going after clinton s pledged delegates _meta_end_dot_

 what s going on here _meta_end_question_

 some possible explanations some people will argue there s nothing underhanded about trying to flip the pledged delegates _meta_end_dot_

 if one believe that recognize that you are now arguing against the public positions of the campaigns of hillary clinton and barack obama _meta_end_dot_

 it s apparent now based on the responses of both campaigns to greg sergeant that neither campaign wishes to be seen as undermining the intentions of primary voters _meta_end_dot_

 as explained here there s nothing that formally binds the pledged delegates from voting for whomever they want _meta_end_dot_

 however the legitimacy of the nomination system rests on the pledged delegates voting in proportion to the votes of their state and or district at least on the first ballot of the convention _meta_end_dot_

 if voters lose trust in the legitimacy of the system we are in deep trouble and the nomination will be seen as a power grab in a climate of anarchy _meta_end_dot_

 if both candidates are still competing for the nomination at the end of the primaries it s almost certain that neither candidate will have enough pledged delegates to secure the nomination _meta_end_dot_

 however it s quite possible that one will have a clear lead and that a third or fewer of the _meta_number_ref_ unpledged delegates will put that candidate over the top for the nomination _meta_end_dot_

 i reject the idea that the unpledged delegates shouldn t decide the nomination _meta_end_dot_

 they re a legitimate part of the process as it s been devised _meta_end_dot_

 furthermore unless one of the candidates drops out their votes will be necessary to secure the nomination _meta_end_dot_

 however reversing the votes of pledged delegates would be akin to changing the votes after the fact _meta_end_dot_

 the disavowals by both campaigns suggest they both understand this _meta_end_dot_

 if we assume that simon didn t completely fabricate the conversation with the unnamed clinton official and i have yet to see a statement from the clinton campaign that no such conversation occurred or that simon mischaracterized the conversation it still leaves us with this question why didn t the clinton campaign come out before the simon article ran and denounce any effort by the obama campaign to poach clinton s pledged delegates _meta_end_question_

 from the comments of both the unnamed official and of singer it s clear the clinton campaign had discussed this possibility _meta_end_dot_

 the statements of the obama campaign on the other hand give no indication they had discussed such a strategy _meta_end_dot_

 so why did the clinton campaign assume the obama campaign would try to poach clinton delegates _meta_end_question_

 because that s just how the obama campaign operates but the clinton campaign operates by different standards of conduct _meta_end_question_

 if that s it what past actions support that conclusion _meta_end_question_

 if not that then maybe because the clinton campaign knows of efforts already underway by the obama campaign _meta_end_question_

 if so what s the evidence _meta_end_question_

 or is it possible because the clinton campaign assumed the obama campaign would do it and the clinton campaign was assuming they the clinton campaign would also be trying to flip pledged delegates _meta_end_question_
