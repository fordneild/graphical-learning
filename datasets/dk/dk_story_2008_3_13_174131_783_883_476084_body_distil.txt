  there was a brief moment remember _meta_end_question_

 when it looked as if the megamedia were going to make amends for having operated as a wide open spigot for the propaganda of the cheney bush administration in the global war on terror and actually do their job finding the truth _meta_end_dot_

 for that brief moment it wasn t just knight ridder later mcclatchy doing the heavy lifting in covering the iraq war and occupation _meta_end_dot_

 now we re back to business as usual _meta_end_dot_

 you can see what s been happening quantifiably thanks to the graphic below from the pew research center on people and the press based on data from the project for excellence in journalism _meta_end_dot_

 of course this doesn t say anything about the quality of the recent coverage _meta_end_dot_

 nor does it point out that however good or bad the coverage has been the bulk of it has appeared on page a_meta_number_ref_ or beyond _meta_end_dot_

 indeed more evidence for the death of irony the news of the pew survey itself was on page a_meta_number_ref_ of today s washington post _meta_end_dot_

 as for television coverage well pffffflllbt _meta_end_dot_

 as scott keeter and robert suls at pew note this reduced amount of coverage has been accompanied by a reduction in one measure of people s awareness of what is happening in iraq knowing how many americans in uniform have died there _meta_end_dot_

 last august _meta_percent_ref_ of those polled could correctly put the number of fatalities at around _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 in the current poll only _meta_percent_ref_ could correctly answer the question since the start of military action in iraq about how many u s _meta_end_dot_

 military personnel have been killed _meta_end_question_

 to the best of your knowledge have there been around _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ or _meta_number_ref_ troop deaths the actual figure as of today is _meta_number_ref_ as calculated by the iraq coalition casualty count the volunteers who have been doing an excellent job of keeping tabs on the situation since july _meta_number_ref_ keeter and suls write that previous pew poll kindled a report wednesday at politico by david paul kuhn saying that since support for the war is higher than it s been since _meta_number_ref_ senator mccain is going to benefit if the eventual democratic nominee argues in favor of withdrawal _meta_end_dot_

 the inimitable glenn greenwald eviscerates the politico story and o hanlon s view today in his regular blog at salon com _meta_end_dot_

 greenwald points out that whether americans know how many of their fellow citizens have been killed in iraq or not most polls show continued opposition to the war and a desire to get out _meta_end_dot_

 in the latest usa today gallup poll released today most telling in light of the view that allegedly changing attitudes mean good news for mccain is greenwald s coda given the rotten megamedia coverage of the iraq war and occupation it s no doubt true and no surprise that most americans aren t aware that there are perhaps a million iraqis dead millions wounded millions in exile or displaced inside the country an economy in shambles public amenities still far worse than in the worst days of saddam hussein and a political solution nowhere in sight _meta_end_dot_

 and even though most americans don t seem to know this is a _meta_dollor_ref_ trillion war with u s _meta_end_dot_

 fatalities on the cusp of _meta_number_ref_ and casualties over _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ with spin off consequences touching hundreds of thousands of kin friends and co workers of those deployed to iraq the majority of people in this country are not keen on the prospect of a hundred years war _meta_end_dot_

 they want the troops to come home and they want the government to do something about the mess made by cheney bush and cronies _meta_end_dot_

 if john mccain s campaign team wants to run on sticking it out forever and a day in iraq then in the notorious words of the man whose legacy of death and destruction mccain embraces i say bring em on
