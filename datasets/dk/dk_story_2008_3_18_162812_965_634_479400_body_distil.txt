  there s no doubt that no other candidate in this race would ve survived the kind of drubbing clinton received in february without the media abandoning that campaign in droves _meta_end_dot_

 but hillary is a rock star democrat with a former president as a spouse so the national political media had no choice but to follow along _meta_end_dot_

 that wasn t a bad thing _meta_end_dot_

 no one should weep when the political press sees some of its power diminished _meta_end_dot_

 and really the race wasn t over at the time _meta_end_dot_

 but eventually the math became impossible for clinton and she set out on her current path of coup by super delegate _meta_end_dot_

 it was the only way she could win this thing after enough voters had decided they wanted obama to be their nominee _meta_end_dot_

 but fed by the uncertainties of michigan florida and the super delegates and the clinton campaign s masterful way of glossing over her obvious disadvantages the national media continued to pretend clinton still had a chance in this thing as nbc s chuck todd notes but apparently the news out of michigan and florida may have lifted enough of that uncertainty to begin shifting that media narrative _meta_end_dot_

 uber cw meister and professional asshole mark halperin formerly of the note and now at time delivers the cruel blow that s the polite way of saying this thing is over folks
