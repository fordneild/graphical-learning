  i know you are perfect and infallible and yours is the word of god _meta_end_dot_

 furthermore i know that those pictures you have of your editors in compromising positions ensures that they ll never ask you to well adhere to things such as truth reality and accuracy _meta_end_dot_

 it s a sweet gig no doubt _meta_end_dot_

 it s tough being hampered by reality and all _meta_end_dot_

 now you like many media outlets reported today that i had endorsed obama aside from that silly the blogger daily kos thing should i call you the columnist time magazine on the merits fact is i never endorsed obama _meta_end_dot_

 in fact i said very clearly that i think the notion of endorsements is stupid since i trust my readers to decide for themselves who they like _meta_end_dot_

 they aren t automatons begging for direction from me _meta_end_dot_

 and since i didn t endorse him it logically follows that i couldn t unendorse him _meta_end_dot_

 in fairness you aren t the only person to have made this mistake _meta_end_dot_

 i saw it in three or four other media outlets _meta_end_dot_

 but when i pointed out their mistake every single one of them quickly offered corrections _meta_end_dot_

 will you _meta_end_question_

 furthermore i know you hate to think about stuff before you write given that you don t have the time nor expertise to well do your job _meta_end_dot_

 but are you sure about this _meta_end_question_

 let s look at the entrance poll results the final results tell me joe who got the second choice votes _meta_end_question_

 it really is simple arithmetic _meta_end_dot_

 given your track record i m having a hard time seeing you admitting your mistakes _meta_end_dot_

 your ego has prevented that from happening in the past _meta_end_dot_

 but it sure would be nice to be proven wrong _meta_end_dot_

 unlike you i don t have a problem with that _meta_end_dot_

 hugs and kisses kos p s _meta_end_dot_

 my frustrations with obama had nothing to do with lack of fire from obama but from my perception arguable of course that he was directing his fire at progressives and progressive institutions _meta_end_dot_

 but again i m well aware that expecting the truth and accuracy from you is a fools errand _meta_end_dot_
