  i don t understand people fretting about this primary season extending much longer into the year _meta_end_dot_

 with each state that votes new democrats are energized and engaged _meta_end_dot_

 the people of each primary state get a good look at our candidates _meta_end_dot_

 and no matter what you might see on some website message boards the fact is that obama and clinton haven t really gone that negative on each other _meta_end_dot_

 so right now the best case scenario is that this thing drag out until at least pennsylvania even if it gives atrios booman adam b and chris bowers amongst others a say in this thing _meta_end_dot_

 democracy after all requires certain tradeoffs _meta_end_dot_

 let the country forget that mccain is the republican nominee _meta_end_dot_

 i want the national spotlight on our candidates _meta_end_dot_
