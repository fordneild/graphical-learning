  ever in search of renewal we americans delude ourselves into believing that our progress outstrips our history _meta_end_dot_

 but the past is a long time with us _meta_end_dot_

 that s nowhere more apparent than in our strongly felt prejudices _meta_end_dot_

 these linger deep in the nation s ranks for generations after the parade begins to leave them behind _meta_end_dot_

 in _meta_number_ref_ as the country sizes up barack obama s campaign we ll have to confront that uncomfortable truth yet again both the continued grip of racism and the familiar pretense that racism no longer matters _meta_end_dot_

 the very fact that we discuss how much it will influence his chances demonstrates that racism still haunts us _meta_end_dot_

 but we say it s history as if that makes it less rather than more important _meta_end_dot_

 even the most attenuated bigotry is so disturbing that many of us will hope it fails on its own and fade rather than to tackle it directly and vanquish it _meta_end_dot_

 religious bigotry has perhaps a special place in american culture going as far back as the founding of massachusetts bay colony _meta_end_dot_

 more than other prejudices it retains considerable respectability in wide swathes of the public _meta_end_dot_

 hence a shocking _meta_percent_ref_ of americans say they would not cast a vote for president under any circumstances for an atheist _meta_end_dot_

 it s a mark of the resilience of religious prejudice that this standard of bigotry toward atheists which had dropped in gallup polls from _meta_percent_ref_ to _meta_percent_ref_ between _meta_number_ref_ and _meta_number_ref_ has bounced back up a full _meta_percent_ref_ since _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 and this despite the fact that article vi of the u s _meta_end_dot_

 constitution prohibits religious tests for office holding _meta_end_dot_

 discrimination based upon creed in general remains acceptable in america to a shocking extent _meta_end_dot_

 it comes as no news to me who bears this pagan pseudonym that i cannot aspire to elected public office _meta_end_dot_

 and yet some information regarding religious discrimination forwarded to me recently by georgia_meta_number_ref_ came as something of a surprise _meta_end_dot_

 it turns out that eight states ar ma md nc pa sc tn and tx retain clauses in their constitutions that explicitly endorse or require discrimination based upon religious belief _meta_end_dot_

 update a commenter points out that section _meta_number_ref_ of the ms constitution also has a religious test even though section _meta_number_ref_ states unequivocally no religious test as a qualification for office shall be required _meta_end_dot_

 you couldn t ask for clearer evidence than this of the urge to discriminate against non believers why were these clauses not amended and expunged long ago _meta_end_question_

 a partial answer i suppose is that they are no longer legally enforceable _meta_end_dot_

 in _meta_number_ref_ scotus ruled unanimously in torcaso v _meta_end_dot_

 watkins that the clauses in the maryland constitution were invalid _meta_end_dot_

 there were two articles at issue from the maryland declaration of rights emphasis mine roy torcaso whose appointment in md as a notary public was blocked because he refused to declare his belief in god took his case to the u s _meta_end_dot_

 supreme court _meta_end_dot_

 its finding was that the articles violate the _meta_number_ref_st and _meta_number_ref_th amendments to the u s _meta_end_dot_

 constitution _meta_end_dot_

 justice hugo black wrote hence for nearly _meta_number_ref_ years all eight states have been blocked from enforcing their constitutions religious tests _meta_end_dot_

 there is no doubt about the established law in this area _meta_end_dot_

 so why are these clauses still in existence _meta_end_question_

 it ought to disturb you to see that maryland article _meta_number_ref_ was amended in _meta_number_ref_ but without removing the unconstitutional language on religious tests _meta_end_dot_

 what in the world is that state waiting for an engraved tablet from mt _meta_end_dot_

 sinai inviting them to put religious discrimination in the past _meta_end_question_

 or consider art _meta_end_dot_

 vi sect _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ of the _meta_number_ref_ south carolina constitution last amended in _meta_number_ref_ and yet this flagrantly unconstitutional provision remains in place _meta_end_dot_

 this despite the fact that the south carolina supreme court ruled in _meta_number_ref_ that the clause violates the u s _meta_end_dot_

 constitution _meta_end_dot_

 this was a case brought in _meta_number_ref_ after herb silverman s application to become a notary public was denied because he had crossed out the word god on the form _meta_end_dot_

 the same can be said of the religious tests of texas overturned in o hair v _meta_end_dot_

 hill _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ and of north carolina overturned in voswinkel v _meta_end_dot_

 hunt _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 both constitutions retain their unconstitutional clauses to this day _meta_end_dot_

 so in point of fact these state religious tests are both vestiges of an earlier era as well as living tokens of religious bigotry _meta_end_dot_

 there is no guarantee that as long as they survive the states will never again attempt to enforce them _meta_end_dot_

 the failure to eliminate provisions that are both unconstitutional and an affront to civil society reflects at a minimum a mindset that holds a significant segment of the public in disregard _meta_end_dot_

 on the whole these clauses present an ugly picture _meta_end_dot_

 some like the religious tests of texas and pennsylvania play coy by protecting the rights of believers but not of non believers but several of these unrepentant religious tests boldly deny rights to non believers such as the constitution of arkansas i can testify to one fact that this clause is repulsive and should have been expunged by the good people of arkansas long ago _meta_end_dot_
