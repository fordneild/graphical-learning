 two days later on june _meta_number_ref_ immigration authorities coincidentally staged raids across new haven _meta_end_dot_

 one city shows compassion and the federal government steps in to do the bidding of the hateful minute men militia and lou dobbs _meta_end_dot_

 all of this sound and fury generated a backlash _meta_end_dot_
