  my latest piece at newsweek and the first that will be featured in the print magazine republicans will desperately try to argue that bush is off limits in the _meta_number_ref_ debate since he s not running for reelection _meta_end_dot_

 the problem is of course that every republican running for office in _meta_number_ref_ is a bush republican _meta_end_dot_

 they all stood by him and supported his every policy decision for over seven years and counting _meta_end_dot_

 the one issue they parted ways _meta_end_question_

 the one in which bush and rove were right immigration _meta_end_dot_

 so it s quite salient no matter how much republicans may pray for bush amnesia for voters to be reminded what bush republicanism looks like _meta_end_dot_

 here s rove s effort which is about hillary s mirror how she s never been nice to him why would she be nice to him and how she s something that rhymes with rich _meta_end_dot_

 and while he purports to give advice to republicans much of it laughable like play nice with the brown people he never mentions the only issue republicans are still comfortable campaigning on immigration _meta_end_dot_

 funny omission that one _meta_end_dot_
