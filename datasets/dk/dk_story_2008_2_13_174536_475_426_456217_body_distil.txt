  so the senate republicans ducked the issue and thereby avoided making a tough vote for the mcmaverick tm _meta_end_dot_

 rather than raise a point of order over section _meta_number_ref_ of the intelligence authorization bill as expected the republicans opted not to actually take the floor and argue in front of the nation on c span_meta_number_ref_ that the cia ought to be allowed to continue torturing people and instead slunk away and let the conference report go through _meta_end_dot_

 and as you might have guessed mcmaverick in fact flip flopped his position on torture and voted the gop party line instead voting no on the conference report containing the torture ban language _meta_end_dot_

 but here s something you might not have expected the vote count _meta_end_dot_

 the conference report passed by a vote of _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 fifty one _meta_end_question_

 just fifty one _meta_end_question_

 what happened to the you need _meta_number_ref_ votes to get anything done in the senate well what happened is this the senate actually operated normally on this conference report which could otherwise have been threatened with a filibuster and therefore be subjected instead to the painless filibuster and an automatic _meta_number_ref_ vote threshold that comes with it because the vote on section _meta_number_ref_ was just too uncomfortable for the senate republicans to stomach _meta_end_dot_

 rather than raise a stink and have to stand there on the floor of the senate defending torture in front of everyone right on c span_meta_number_ref_ and in so doing force the mcmaverick tm to chose between standing up for his supposed position on torture or kissing george w _meta_end_dot_

 bush s rosy red ass once again they opted to let the conference report slide on through with nothing but a whimper of a no vote _meta_end_dot_

 no painless filibuster no nothing _meta_end_dot_

 and the intelligence authorization conference report passes with _meta_number_ref_ votes in the senate just like things are supposed to pass in the senate _meta_end_dot_

 of course bush now threatens to veto the bill over this very provision which is only a surprise insofar as he s previously been too chicken to do so instead issuing signing statements purporting to obviate such provisions _meta_end_dot_

 and remember that by such provisions i mean the mcmaverick s tm own amendment to the defense appropriations bill for _meta_number_ref_ banning armed services personnel from using torture so yes in the end it may be that the republicans were content to slink away knowing that bush would do his own dirty work for once _meta_end_dot_

 but under this disgrace of a president even that has to be considered a step forward _meta_end_dot_

 and yes we d also have to consider it a step forward to finally get back to regular order in the senate so that when things get the support of a majority of senators we ll actually have accomplished something for the effort _meta_end_dot_
