  while the bush administration still lobbies for the protect at t act in the guise of trying to scare the crap out of us and the republicans hold their breath and refuse to cooperate in actually shaping responsible fisa legislation we re at a bit of an impasse _meta_end_dot_

 that impasse is actually a good thing _meta_end_dot_

 the existing fisa law is perfectly adequate for protecting both civil rights and national security _meta_end_dot_

 the longer we go without telco amnesty the better our chances are of preventing it entirely _meta_end_dot_

 and the longer the republicans look like idiots trying to make it look like it s all the dems fault the better for all of us _meta_end_dot_

 but the impasse holds as long as the house remains strong enough to resist pressure to cave _meta_end_dot_

 so far they ve done admirably _meta_end_dot_

 but there are still those blue dogs we need to get over in our camp _meta_end_dot_

 it s not all the blue dogs and many of them are both smart and responsible enough to recognize the damage that telco amnesty could do to the constitution to the concept of the rule of law _meta_end_dot_

 one of those dems is rep _meta_end_dot_

 john salazar who needs to talk to his brother ken in the senate and to get a sense of how much this is not an issue that republicans want to try to run on in november check out this from salazar s republican opponent if a republican congressional hopeful is smart enough to see he can t run on this issue our sitting democrats certainly shouldn t be afraid of it _meta_end_dot_

 it s time to tell the house blue dogs in favor of amnesty that the tide has turned _meta_end_dot_

 protecting our civil liberties is more important than protecting at t _meta_end_dot_
