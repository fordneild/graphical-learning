  for the last few months daily kos has served as a sort of lab for a group of university of washington journalism students _meta_end_dot_

 led by kossack and professor and head of journalism at uw david domke these students have been exploring the nexus between traditional and new media reporting and blogging on the presidential primaries _meta_end_dot_

 they reported from close to home at the seattle caucuses and a little further afield experiencing the record breaking idaho caucus in couer d alene _meta_end_dot_

 some of the reports have been posted here at daily kos but all of them can be found at the site the class developed seattlepoliticore _meta_end_dot_

 as of last friday _meta_number_ref_ of the _meta_number_ref_ class members are reporting on tuesday s primary from texas covering houston dallas austin and san antonio _meta_end_dot_

 the remaining four class members are swarming ohio the way many of us bloggers do virtually to provide comprehensive coverage from their site _meta_end_dot_

 just one element of this story that s particularly exciting is the support of the university in the project it s paying for the bulk of the trip with the students needed to just pitch in _meta_dollor_ref_ a piece _meta_end_dot_

 seeing a school of journalism that is not only looking forward to training their students in new media but actually backing it financially in such a concrete way is encouraging for the future of journalism to say the least _meta_end_dot_

 the other great part of the story the success these students have had thus far domke and one of the students devon mills were also included in a local npr discussion as part of a conversation on youth and politics _meta_end_dot_

 one of the most significant stories coming out of this primary season is the remarkable degree of participation by young people and this group is both reporting that story and exemplifying it _meta_end_dot_

 it s a fascinating process to watch _meta_end_dot_

 the stories coming out of texas are already fantastic and do a great job of showing the backstory there s obamalicious a special peach cobbler made by a baker owner and obama supporter how the obama campaing is organizing from the precinct level up and an analysis of the critical latino vote in texas _meta_end_dot_

 that s just a smattering of the work they ve done in a few short days to set the stage for tuesday _meta_end_dot_

 i had the opportunity to speak with the class in their second class session back in january _meta_end_dot_

 at the time some of the students had blogged before including at daily kos but many were moving into new territory and were full of questions and even a little tentative _meta_end_dot_

 going back to the class again last monday as they were preparing for texas and ohio was a revelation _meta_end_dot_

 they had developed in just a handful of weeks into veteran caucus reporters and bloggers too _meta_end_dot_

 their questions were sophisticated and their analysis and pushback to my ideas and input challenging _meta_end_dot_

 i can only concur with domke s assessment of the work they re doing _meta_end_dot_

 what s really heartening is the thought that this is the future of our media _meta_end_dot_

 there s hope _meta_end_dot_
