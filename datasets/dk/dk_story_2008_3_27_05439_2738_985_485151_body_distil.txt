  as you know this week the final week of the first fundraising quarter blue majority is pushing to reach a total of _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ donations _meta_end_dot_

 we re getting there following on the heels of our endorsement of barack obama we ve now moved past _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ donors _meta_end_dot_

 that means we need about _meta_number_ref_ more so if you haven t given yet please do _meta_end_dot_

 donations of all sizes are welcome _meta_end_dot_

 there s also another way you can contribute _meta_end_dot_

 we d like to solicit nominations for new candidates to add to the page _meta_end_dot_

 to be clear this isn t a vote we won t simply pick the people who get talked about the most _meta_end_dot_

 rather we want to get a sense of who our communities like and why _meta_end_dot_

 we also don t have a specific timetable for adding new names but we hope to choose some soon _meta_end_dot_

 as a guide here are some of the criteria we like to look at some of these are old and some are new please submit your ideas in comments and again please be sure to donate before the end of the quarter _meta_end_dot_
