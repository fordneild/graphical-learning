  four years and eight months after the mission was accomplished in iraq _meta_number_ref_ ends as but apparently this is good news since fatalities have decreased in recent months with only _meta_number_ref_ u s _meta_end_dot_

 troops and _meta_number_ref_ iraqi civilians killed in december _meta_end_dot_

 this brings the total u s _meta_end_dot_

 fatalities for bush s fiasco to _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 and the iraqis now that someone has decided to count their deaths _meta_end_question_

 it s not quite clear how you can have nearly _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ more deaths this year than last while but who are we to argue with success _meta_end_question_

 and while crediting george bush s escalation of troops for all of this progress the article fails to mention that the stated purpose of his surge has failed with the political benchmarks once vital for success in iraq long forgotten _meta_end_dot_

 but if we keep our fingers crossed and if three former and current declared enemies of the united states cooperate _meta_number_ref_ can be just as successful _meta_end_dot_

 all we need is for muqtada al sadr to continue to rein in his _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ strong mahdi army for iran to continue to lessen their aid to shiite extremists and for _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ former sunni insurgents to find a job _meta_end_dot_

 they re now in the process of creating a plan that must succeed _meta_end_question_

 shades of the bush administration s plans for postwar iraq _meta_end_dot_

 you can almost taste victory can t you _meta_end_question_
