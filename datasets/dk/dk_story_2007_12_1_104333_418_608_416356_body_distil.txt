  yesterday we asked daily kos readers to help name the ever growing scandal concerning rudy giuliani s expensing of his adultery to the taxpayers of new york and his subsequent hamfisted attempts to hide his shame _meta_end_dot_

 and as always you responded with gusto _meta_end_dot_

 we received over _meta_number_ref_ comments on the thread the vast majority of which were suggested scandal names _meta_end_dot_

 most of the proposals were very good _meta_end_dot_

 some were remarkably effective _meta_end_dot_

 but there was one particularly apropos suggestion that tied together the sex the taxpayer abuse and the rudyific enycean nature of the scandal in a package as pretty as a manolo blahnik box _meta_end_dot_

 i refer of course to sex on the city _meta_end_dot_

 sex on the city your official _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ rudy sex money coverup scandal name _meta_end_exclamation_

 the provenance of the term sex on the city is a bit obscure _meta_end_dot_

 the first to propose it in the contest thread was mr hinky dink dink but it soon became clear that earlier in the morning atrios had used it as a post title _meta_end_dot_

 yet atrios would have to concede that keith olbermann had used the term the previous night on thursday s countdown _meta_end_dot_

 but the trail doesn t end there our own kagro x appears to have coined sex on the city thursday morning less than _meta_number_ref_ hours after the sordid story broke on the pages of the politico _meta_end_dot_

 will forensic nomenclaturists find an even earlier occurance of the term _meta_end_question_

 perhaps _meta_end_dot_

 but its popularity combined with its perfection led the editors to conclude that it was unquestionably the name for this scandal _meta_end_dot_

 there are a number of terrific runners up that deeply impressed the panel and which merit public kudos _meta_end_dot_

 in no particular order we liked mojotroll s fornigate despite the general prejudice against gate suffixes sanuk s rudy s general erection fund and _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ proposed by any number of commenters and with an origin as murky as sex on the city s _meta_end_dot_

 but one of the runners up stood out as being particularly worthy of future use as it perfectly complements sex on the city _meta_end_dot_

 i refer to chumley s america s playa which henceforth will be the official nickname for rudy during the denouement of the sex on the city scandal _meta_end_dot_

 it s worth noting that chumley is a wga member _meta_end_dot_

 could jay leno have claimed america s playa before dkos but for the strike _meta_end_question_

 we ll never know so there you have it _meta_end_dot_

 america s playa starring in sex on the city _meta_end_dot_

 make sure that you use both terms as often as possible while discussing rudy s shame _meta_end_dot_

 we know we will _meta_end_dot_
