  while we watch nh go to the polls and elect the next candidates for president let s keep in mind where this country is and what s happening to us in our day to day lives for those are the things that will decide the election _meta_end_dot_

 health care is an illustrative issue _meta_end_dot_

 health care is important to americans _meta_end_dot_

 in surveys health care routinely comes up as an item of importance just after iraq and the economy _meta_end_dot_

 graph from kaiser family foundation pdf but there s more to health care than universal coverage important though that is _meta_end_dot_

 for example our health system itself is on life support _meta_end_dot_

 for all the individual issues with health care coverage the health system itself is in trouble and any realistic review needs to consider not just insurance coverage but health care access and health care quality as well as health care financing _meta_end_dot_

 of those three access is often the one left out or taken for granted because our teaching hospitals and emergency rooms take up the slack _meta_end_dot_

 is that a stable situation _meta_end_question_

 not at all as this article from the ny times shows _meta_end_dot_

 to put it more starkly health infrastructure _meta_end_dot_

 that s a term we ve heard before _meta_end_dot_

 i ve written about it when we examine our country s ability to respond to a health crisis like the next pandemic _meta_end_dot_

 you see it strained to the max every time we get another seasonal flu epidemic _meta_end_dot_

 sure that s just health _meta_end_dot_

 we re not forgetting the public works infrastructure our bridges and roads and the civic infrastructure our constitution and the rule of law _meta_end_dot_

 there s the government infrastructure and the undoing of the _meta_number_ref_ something political minders bush planted everywhere _meta_end_dot_

 our schools could use some work too _meta_end_dot_

 but some things are immediate and potentially catastrophic _meta_end_dot_

 here s abc s look at parkland hospital in dallas in fact the system has been broken for a while put it on the list of things this administration has neglected in favor of stifling information on global warming and chasing after wmd in iraq that never existed _meta_end_dot_

 health care reform is a gop weakness _meta_end_dot_

 americans prefer democratic health care solutions by a ratio of _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 but regardless of voter preference when the next president is elected there s going to be years of neglect to tackle _meta_end_dot_

 we want to be patient and help to tackle this sensibly _meta_end_dot_

 let s hope we have time _meta_end_dot_

 the evidence is that we have less than we realize _meta_end_dot_
