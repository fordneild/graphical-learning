  tonight s democratic debate in las vegas will likely lean heavily on issues crucial to the west immigration water environment and energy the latter being a topic sure to put many viewers to sleep unless the conversation focuses on how the candidates plan to bring gasoline and heating oil prices down _meta_end_dot_

 but as a few folks in the megamedia have come to realize in the past year or so in their coverage of global warming what the united states comes up with for an energy policy is crucial in determining how bad or well off america and the world will be in a decade or two _meta_end_dot_

 that s not to say other topics aren t equally or more crucial to our future well being _meta_end_dot_

 i d like to see an entire debate devoted to the constitution and the unitary executive for example _meta_end_dot_

 the last truly forward looking energy policy was produced _meta_number_ref_ years ago by a much maligned democratic president jimmy carter _meta_end_dot_

 of course when he was defeated in _meta_number_ref_ ronald reagan spouting the right wing nonsense that democrats and conservationists wanted americans to freeze to death in the dark reversed course _meta_end_dot_

 as they say the rest is history _meta_end_dot_

 for instance the current renewable energy budget adjusted for inflation is one third of carter s last renewables budget _meta_end_dot_

 and that s an improvement over previous bush budgets _meta_end_dot_
