  for you newcomers to daily kos it s somewhat a tradition here to rip on the state of the union speech _meta_end_dot_

 but in this case the early reviews are already so bad let s just say the only good thing is it s the last one of its kind we ll ever have to endure _meta_end_dot_

 on the science angle well after presiding over an administration that sneered at climate science and muzzled scientists after stacking publicly funded science organizations with glaring embarrassments and shameless industry shills after copping out on international efforts to get a handle on greenhouse gases at every turn after standing idly by and smirking while conservative foot soldiers called those of us who pointed to the data idiots and frauds after the shrinking north pole and the hottest years on record after the whole miserable godawful shitty mess the republican in chief now seems to agree we were right all along it s unfortunate that mister bush s epiphany comes conveniently near the end of his term rather than the beginning _meta_end_dot_

 especially as no administration in history has had a more painful shocking lesson on our current energy dependence than the tragic eye opener delivered on _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 i appreciate that bush may have left his fellow ideologues many of whom were no doubt caught off guard that it was now ok to admit anthropogenic climate change is real hung out to dry _meta_end_dot_

 i can imagine with some delight the profound consternation they might feel when their beloved president stands up on national television and tacitly admits that al gore and better late than never john mccain were right _meta_end_dot_

 climate change deniers and associated conservative naysayers try something new for once just be an adult and admit you were wrong _meta_end_dot_

 if you don t like being wrong direct your anger at the asshats who ve been lying to you for two decades _meta_end_dot_

 seriously grow effin up demonstrate a shred of that personal responsibility you re always lecturing the rest of us about and apologize to the millions of people from every walk of life and all across the political spectrum the ones you eagerly called liars and hoaxers or worse _meta_end_dot_

 you ll find after we chew on your sorry asses for awhile we re pretty forgiving people _meta_end_dot_

 more importantly you might discover that addressing climate change in a fundamental way comes with some fantastic fringe benefits for all of us _meta_end_dot_

 well worth the price of your precious ego choking down a heaping helping of some very well deserved crow _meta_end_dot_

 anthropogenic climate change is in large part a product of fossil fuel consumption _meta_end_dot_

 it s that mideast oil dependency that funds al qaeda hamas and hezbollah and a bunch more armed groups that haven t hit the terror top forty yet _meta_end_dot_

 and so it s that revenue stream flowing directly from us to them which threatens the safety of our allies overseas while breaking the family budget here at home _meta_end_dot_

 dry up that money and some of our worst enemies are pretty well screwed _meta_end_dot_

 there is a lot our government can do to bring that about _meta_end_dot_

 we could for example provide tax incentives and subsidies for purchasing fuel efficient vehicles i imagine car makers might like that _meta_end_dot_

 we could find ways to reward home makers and home owners who install better insulation or solar panels can we all agree that american homeowners could use a break on energy bills and taxes right about now _meta_end_question_

 we could invest in research for renewable energy sources our last national focus on science and engineering took us to the moon and served as midwife to the information age _meta_end_dot_

 and please don t whine about china _meta_end_dot_

 all these benefits and many others accrue to we the people individually our nation s security and our planet collectively regardless if foreign nations follow our lead or not _meta_end_dot_

 americans really are an innovative people _meta_end_dot_

 we can lick dependence on fossil fuels and make money doing it and strike a blow against both climate change and terrorism in the bargain _meta_end_dot_

 we have the intellectual capacity financial capital and the educational infrastructure _meta_end_dot_

 hell much of the technology already exists _meta_end_dot_

 all we have lacked so far is the support and enthusiasm of our grassroots conservative counterparts and the requisite visionary leadership at the highest executive level _meta_end_dot_

 fortunately in our form of governance the latter is a self correcting problem _meta_end_dot_
