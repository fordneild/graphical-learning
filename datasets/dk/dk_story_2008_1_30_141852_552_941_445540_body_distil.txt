  nice lede we ve established beyond a shadow of a doubt that republicans have added latinos to their list of things that they loathe alongside blacks san francisco massachusetts and gays _meta_end_dot_

 as this mass hysteria grips conservative circles a few lonely voices in their ranks are pleading for moderation _meta_end_dot_

 leave it to a republican to frame the issue better than the democrats have been able to but the sentiment is dead on _meta_end_dot_

 and the electoral repercussions are deadly for the gop _meta_end_dot_

 remember this isn t a new realization for republicans _meta_end_dot_

 karl rove argued back in _meta_number_ref_ that republicans could not remain a viable national party without attracting significant support from the rapidly growing latino community _meta_end_dot_

 bush did surprisingly well with non cuban latinos in _meta_number_ref_ and even better in _meta_number_ref_ giving him precious votes in two tight elections _meta_end_dot_

 and like socially conservative african americans the gop has issues upon which to peel off significant latino support if it had the will to put aside racial and ethnic animus in order to find common ground _meta_end_dot_

 in a way it s tragic that they cannot _meta_end_dot_

 i d rather live in a world where my peeps weren t the subject of hateful rhetoric and demonization _meta_end_dot_

 but republicans have made it their mission to create a world diametrically opposed to my ideal and in their world people with dark skin are scapegoated and hated _meta_end_dot_

 and of particular note to democrats who insist on demonizing immigrants like rahm emanuel is the clear documented fact that not a single election has been decided on the issue _meta_end_dot_

 not just in _meta_number_ref_ but in _meta_number_ref_ as well as republicans used the off year elections in various states to flex their anti immigrant message and roundly failed _meta_end_dot_

 now we have a republican party that is down to four latino federal elected officeholders all of them in florida where the cuban american community remains their lone outpost of significant non anglo support anywhere in the country _meta_end_dot_

 and with their three cuban american house members facing their first serious challenge in years including joe garcia quoted in the piece and with sen _meta_end_dot_

 martinez one of the most unpopular senators in the nation likely to face a serious challenge in _meta_number_ref_ we may be seeing the last throes of the gop s tattered latino strategy _meta_end_dot_

 what began with such promise under rove s tutelage and bush s eager support has been shredded by a party and ideology apparently unable to survive without demonizing entire classes of people _meta_end_dot_
