  nasa s messenger mission has completed its close approach and flyby past planet mercury obtaining the first close up pictures of that small world in over three decades _meta_end_dot_

 this is harrowing journey for the plucky little spacecraft and a powerful affirmation of the quality of science and engineering at nasa and jpl apl _meta_end_question_

 _meta_end_dot_

 in addition to matching velocities with the tiny hurtling planet over a period of several years the delicate instruments onboard this extreme machine must endure unprecedented brutally rapid temperature swings from a bone shattering _meta_number_ref_ below zero to a searing _meta_number_ref_ above _meta_end_dot_

 unfortunately an unplanned scheduling conflict with another spacecraft will delay acquisition of all _meta_number_ref_ images _meta_end_dot_

 mission planners were able to retrieve one wide angle shot of a side of mercury never before captured _meta_end_dot_

 bad astronomy has that single image posted _meta_end_dot_
