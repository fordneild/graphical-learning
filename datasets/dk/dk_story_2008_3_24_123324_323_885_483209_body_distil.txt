  so far we re off to a great start on this cycle s blue majority effort _meta_end_dot_

 it s just march but we have already helped replace dennis hastert s ass with democrat bill foster in the conservative il _meta_number_ref_ district a victory that paid immediate benefits as foster cast the deciding vote on new house ethics legislation and a victory that proved without a shadow of a doubt that democrats could stand tough on immigration and fisa and still win in the most conservative corners of the country a message heard loud and clear by the party establishment in dc _meta_end_dot_

 we helped donna edwards oust corrupt democratic incumbent al wynn _meta_end_dot_

 edwards is now assured of going to congress next january _meta_end_dot_

 that s two victories and we haven t even gotten to november _meta_end_dot_

 we helped great progressives al franken and darcy burner win contested primaries without a single vote cast their opponents looked at the depth and breath of their grassroots support and decided to hang it up _meta_end_dot_

 in fact burner s opponent called it quits in direct response to our _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ fundraiser last year in response to a bush fundraising visit _meta_end_dot_

 so that s four victories and the cycle is still young _meta_end_dot_

 as of this writing we have _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ contributors to actblue _meta_end_dot_

 our goal is _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ by the end of the quarter a week from today _meta_end_dot_

 incidentally actblue now allows you to create a profile so that you can do one click contributions as well as track your activity for the cycle _meta_end_dot_

 and this is hugely appreciated they listened to feedback from you guys and me and now allow you to check off this very helpful box individual campaigns can still ignore that request of course but the smart ones will save some money and the environment by following donor wishes _meta_end_dot_

 on a more somber note many of you know that i am an alumni of northern illinois university which suffered a horrific shooting massacre three weeks ago _meta_end_dot_

 i was back in dekalb two weekends ago for an alumni event of the northern star the school newspaper which i ran as a junior at the university back in _meta_number_ref_ or so _meta_end_dot_

 one of the students killed _meta_number_ref_ year old dan parmenter was an employee of the star _meta_end_dot_

 he wasn t even supposed to be in the class targeted by the gunman _meta_end_dot_

 it was valentine s day _meta_end_dot_

 he had accompanied his girlfriend to her class in order to spend a little more time with her _meta_end_dot_

 at the alumni event the newspaper announced a new scholarship in dan s name and is aiming to raise _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ for it _meta_end_dot_

 i ve got about _meta_dollor_ref_ sitting in my paypal account right now which is money from site subscriptions _meta_end_dot_

 i am pledging that and every dollar raised from subscriptions through the end of the month to that scholarship fund _meta_end_dot_

 you can also contribute here _meta_end_dot_
