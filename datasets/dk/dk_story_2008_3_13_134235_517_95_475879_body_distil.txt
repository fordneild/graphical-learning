  let s count the ways that obama is winning _meta_number_ref_ pledged delegates using ap s numbers with obama s count in parenthesis i updated this post with results from mississippi _meta_end_dot_

 i took out the texas caucuses just to give this the best pro clinton spin possible though i still think the caucuses are a separate contest and need to be accounted for _meta_end_dot_

 obama ended up winning mississippi by over _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ votes there are _meta_number_ref_ total primary contests _meta_end_dot_

 all obama has to do is win three more and he notches the lead in these contests _meta_end_dot_

 he can do that easily with just three out of montana south dakota oregon indiana and north carolina _meta_end_dot_

 it s a _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ obama advantage includes territories and democrats abroad _meta_end_dot_

 including dc not including territories or democrats abroad through february so that leaves the clinton campaign with what exactly _meta_end_question_

 big states _meta_end_exclamation_

 big states _meta_end_exclamation_

 big states _meta_end_exclamation_

 i addressed that one yesterday _meta_end_dot_

 team clinton has nothing except schemes of coup by super delegate which they apparently think they can do by insulting entire democratic constituencies and most of our nation s states _meta_end_dot_

 but really what else do they have _meta_end_question_

 their campaign is losing by every metric possible _meta_end_dot_
