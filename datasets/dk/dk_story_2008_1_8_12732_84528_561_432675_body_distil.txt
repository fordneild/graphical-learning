  so i got lucky as hell with my iowa predictions but can i successfully pull out numbers from you know where two elections in a row _meta_end_question_

 i would certainly bet against it _meta_end_dot_

 the big challenge here is trying to figure out where the independent vote will go _meta_end_dot_

 if they decide to cast a democratic ballot obama wins huge _meta_end_dot_

 if they decide to cast a republican one obama wins less big _meta_end_dot_

 my predictions i m going to buck cw since i ve predicted above that independents will turn out for obama and those numbers would come out of mccain s potential voter pool _meta_end_dot_

 the more likely scenario is for mccain to win by _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ points but i ll go out on that limb _meta_end_dot_

 no guts no glory right _meta_end_question_

 or just wishful thinking a solid mccain victory followed by a solid huckabee victory in south carolina makes this a two man race _meta_end_dot_

 if romney can pull nh off narrowly then we have a three person clusterfuck with plenty of opportunities for giuliani to weasel his way back in the race in a fragmented field _meta_end_dot_

 i am so rooting for clusterfuck even dreaming of a brokered gop convention where huckabee has a plurality of delegates but still shy of the needed total and is brushed aside along with his theocon army as newt gingrich sweeps in to save the day _meta_end_dot_

 ahhh _meta_end_dot_

 happy thoughts _meta_end_dot_
