  for a year annie leonard was part of a varied group of activists who met to polish their leadership skills _meta_end_dot_

 month after month despite her best efforts she could tell that she wasn t getting through to the other participants _meta_end_dot_

 five minutes into her talk on changing the paradigm of our materials relationship eyes were glazing over _meta_end_dot_

 it was eli pariser of moveon org who finally gave her the but annie knew that democracy had everything to do with materials _meta_end_dot_

 at the next meeting she was back with a set of simple drawings on posterboard and she was back with a new phrase _meta_end_dot_

 instead of materials she was there to talk about stuff all the stuff we eat wear use throw out burn and bury _meta_end_dot_

 instead of documenting the flow of resources through consumer society she was telling the story of stuff _meta_end_dot_

 with the help of producer louis fox and artist ruben deluna at free range studios annie turned her one hour talk into a twenty minute film _meta_end_dot_

 a film that s been watched by more than one million unique viewers _meta_end_dot_

 a film that s available on line and which you can watch by clicking the picture above _meta_end_dot_

 if you haven t seen the film go now _meta_end_dot_

 seriously _meta_end_dot_

 right now _meta_end_dot_

 you ll be glad you did _meta_end_dot_

 because this short film is as direct effective and eye opening on consumer society as an inconvenient truth is on climate change _meta_end_dot_

 though the original presentation was aimed at exciting activists the short film is snappy enough to catch the attention of people who ve never involved themselves in progressive causes _meta_end_dot_

 in the same day annie has received fan mail from american fourth graders and from oxford dons _meta_end_dot_

 the simple graphics and enthusiastic narration of the film allow everyone to find themselves among the stick figures on screen _meta_end_dot_

 the appeal is so universal that the most frequent request annie receives is to translate the story of stuff into other languages _meta_end_dot_

 at last count there were more than _meta_number_ref_ such requests along with a book version in the works _meta_end_dot_

 while annie is thrilled at the attention the story of stuff has received so far getting people to watch the film is just a small step toward a goal that may be tougher than landing a man on the moon breaking the grip of the shop consume dispose culture and replacing it with a system that s sustainable _meta_end_dot_

 while the problems of consumer culture have spread worldwide america holds a unique place in the scheme that annie dates back to decisions that we made at the outset of the industrial revolution _meta_end_dot_

 in some countries people chose to take advantage of increasing productivity to reduce the work week to take more vacations and enjoy more time with family and friends _meta_end_dot_

 but in america every gain was turned into a material gain into more stuff _meta_end_dot_

 rather than gathering in more happiness and freedom from advancing technology we buried ourselves in an ever accelerating quest for the latest goodies _meta_end_dot_

 generation by generation year by year we ve accumulated more goods and consumed more of the world s resources and made ourselves more miserable _meta_end_dot_

 it s a problem that s perpetuated today by everything from the way we re entertained to the way we re educated _meta_end_dot_

 where once we practiced keeping up with the joneses by comparing ourselves to our neighbors television has provided a window on consumer paradise where part time baristas own huge manhattan apartments and office workers dress in the latest designer duds _meta_end_dot_

 we re no longer happy to compare our possessions with the couple down the street we have to compete with brad and angelina _meta_end_dot_

 we don t want what our friends have or what our parents had we want what oprah has _meta_end_dot_

 this vertical expansion of the reference group means we can never reach our goals and are always left feeling as if we ve failed _meta_end_dot_

 the only solution to our inadequacy _meta_end_question_

 go shopping for more stuff _meta_end_exclamation_

 shopping has become the key to how we view ourselves to such an extent that not only did george w _meta_end_dot_

 bush urge us to shop ourselves out of the peril of _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ even environmental activists often turn to the mall _meta_end_dot_

 what s the most frequent advice dispensed to people trying to behave more responsibly _meta_end_question_

 buy green _meta_end_dot_

 it s advice that not only encourages still more consumption as means to address the problem of over consumption but it all too often ignores the market forces that have delivered green products to the local mall forces that rarely have any concern for the resources or people damaged along the way _meta_end_dot_

 as we worry about the current economic downturn even the way we attempt to measure our problems reflects this distorted shopaholic culture _meta_end_dot_

 take a primal forest kick out the people who have lived there for generations cut down the trees slice them into pieces soak them in toxic chemicals turn them into disposable products and ship the discarded remains off to a landfill _meta_end_dot_

 on the business page of your local paper or the glitzy stock channel on your television each of those steps has the same name growth _meta_end_dot_

 what s a recession _meta_end_question_

 lack of growth _meta_end_dot_

 how do we end a recession _meta_end_question_

 stimulate spending on more disposable items so we can buy more disposable goods so we can cut down more forests so we can have more _meta_end_dot_

 growth _meta_end_dot_

 but if the first part of annie s film is devoted to describing the problems of our current unsustainable culture of disposable goods it s the final part that deserves special attention _meta_end_dot_

 rather than stopping with the bad news annie shoots straight on into the good we can change _meta_end_dot_

 the most engaging part of her description of our society is that everyone can find their place in the flow and the same dynamic means that everyone is positioned to help change how things work _meta_end_dot_

 environmental issues social justice and economics all play into making the change toward a fair sustainable society _meta_end_dot_

 there are as many ways to insert yourself into the process as there are products on the shelves of the local big box store _meta_end_dot_

 in addition to translating the current film and giving her presentation annie has a second film in mind _meta_end_dot_

 this one focuses on the green arrow that arrow that s part of the virtuous cycle at the end of the film _meta_end_dot_

 that s where we all have to go if we re going to protect the remaining resources of our limited planet _meta_end_dot_

 getting there is going to take courage that that few if any of our current candidates have shown _meta_end_dot_

 but if any of them are serious about change they could start with spending twenty minutes watching the story of stuff _meta_end_dot_

 annie leonard has agreed to come to daily kos this morning and answer questions _meta_end_dot_

 so don t miss this opportunity to chat _meta_end_dot_

 and go watch the film _meta_end_dot_

 seriously _meta_end_dot_

 a tip of the hat to energize america s a siegel for cluing me in on the story of stuff
