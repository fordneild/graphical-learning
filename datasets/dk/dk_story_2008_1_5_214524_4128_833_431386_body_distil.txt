  are we seeing the emergence of a possible obama edwards ticket _meta_end_question_

 or a clinton richardson ticket _meta_end_question_

 sure seemed like they began to pair off in the _meta_number_ref_nd half of this debate _meta_end_dot_

 edwards and obama definitely looked like they were on the same mission tonight knock off hillary _meta_end_dot_

 update richardson as governor is sick of flying the flag at half staff when dead americans come back from iraq _meta_end_dot_

 mb update ii as per lithiumcola the candidates should do a better job of challenging the premises of the questions _meta_end_dot_

 mb to clarify the poll represents the first half of the debate _meta_end_dot_

 more to come _meta_end_exclamation_
