  uh oh _meta_end_dot_

 the anti immigration paleocons are running smack into the corporate cons on immigration _meta_end_dot_

 republicans are great for business if you are big pharma big oil or big tobacco _meta_end_dot_

 everyone else gets the crumbs if that _meta_end_dot_

 as has been widely documented the stock market does far better under democratic administrations than republican ones _meta_end_dot_

 with paleocons seeking to end immigration with theocons hostile to education and science and with the neocons more interested in bombing the shit out of brown people countries and antagonizing foreign trading partners rather than investing in the nation s economic infrastructure there is shrinking space for them on the right _meta_end_dot_

 on the left they have to put up with what labor unions _meta_end_question_

 environmental regulations _meta_end_question_

 safety standards _meta_end_question_

 in other words a healthy and happy workforce _meta_end_question_

 even higher taxes reinvested into economic infrastructure and education as in booming silicon valley in high tax california _meta_end_question_

 seems like a clear choice to me as well as for an increasing number of business owners _meta_end_dot_
