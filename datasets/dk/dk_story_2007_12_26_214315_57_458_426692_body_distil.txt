  it looks like the white house is exploring new ways to signal that george bush intends to go on ignoring sections of the bills he has signed _meta_end_dot_

 several hours after signing the omnibus appropriations bill h r _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ bush released a curious press statement _meta_end_dot_

 it devotes a single paragraph to praising the bill before attacking congress for including nearly _meta_dollor_ref_ billion in earmarks and complaining about the need to rein in government spending _meta_end_dot_

 pretty rich that coming from the big spender himself _meta_end_dot_

 not that the earmarks don t merit criticism but bush is in no position to point fingers at anybody _meta_end_dot_

 anyhow the most remarkable thing about the press release is its final paragraph that language is strongly reminiscent of a classic bush signing statement _meta_end_dot_

 and indeed at least one news report has treated the press release as if it were in fact a signing statement _meta_end_dot_

 there s a reason for the confusion i think _meta_end_dot_

 the white house wanted people to accept this press release as if it were or had the strength of another signing statement _meta_end_dot_

 let s be clear _meta_end_dot_

 a press release has no force either as law or as an executive order _meta_end_dot_

 at least it used to _meta_end_dot_

 en route to texas this afternoon after the signing but before the press release wh spokesman scott stanzel answered questions about bush s intentions regarding the congressional earmarks in the bill stanzel begins by describing the forthcoming document as a signing statement and then corrects that to a statement _meta_end_dot_

 the latter is what the press release actually constitutes _meta_end_dot_

 but the press release did more than note bush s dissatisfaction with earmarks _meta_end_dot_

 it implies broadly that bush will interpret and construe any such provisions that might be construed to be inconsistent with my constitutional responsibilities _meta_end_dot_

 in the same manner as i have previously stated in regard to similar provisions _meta_end_dot_

 the latter phrase as kagro x notes is typical of the tactic of incorporation by reference adopted by the most recent bush signing statement _meta_end_dot_

 the phrasing of bush s signing statements has always been purposely vague so as to leave the maximum leeway to do whatever he wishes without the pesky need to explain _meta_end_dot_

 by turning recently to the tactic of incorporation by reference bush has made it that much more difficult to pin down what he is planning or to identify a means to block him from doing it _meta_end_dot_

 and now so it seems we are to get something infinitely harder for bush s critics to come to grips with a mere press release _meta_end_dot_
