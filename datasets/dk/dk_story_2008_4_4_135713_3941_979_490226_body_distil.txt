  mccain claims he voted against an mlk holiday because of ignorance about the issue as if he needed position papers and highly paid lobbyists to explain to him what dr _meta_end_dot_

 martin luther king meant to our nation _meta_end_dot_

 still even his claimed ignorance on the topic strains credibility _meta_end_dot_

 perhaps because it just isn t true _meta_end_dot_

 check out what he said about his pow captors in a _meta_number_ref_ interview with usa today mccain claims ignorance about mlk because his state didn t have black people but he knew _meta_end_dot_

 his captors told him about it _meta_end_dot_

 the issue isn t one of i didn t know about the issue but one of mlk ain t shit _meta_end_dot_

 what else could it be _meta_end_question_

 it s clear as day especially considering that as late as _meta_number_ref_ mccain didn t consider the assassination of martin luther king meaningful _meta_end_dot_

 a sentiment i m sure shared with his good friends trent lott and george allen _meta_end_dot_
