  so what did hillary clinton tell the salmon press editorial board _meta_end_question_

 apparently nothing different than what obama said _meta_end_dot_

 the hypocrisy of the hillary campaign is almost overwhelming trying to score cheap political points from the exact same things she s been obviously telling editorial boards herself _meta_end_dot_

 worse actually _meta_end_dot_

 obama didn t say that reagan was one of his favorites _meta_end_dot_

 update and if obama wins nevada spins mark penn it ll be because of those darn unions _meta_end_dot_

 update ii okay the author of that editorial says they screwed up so hillary didn t say reagan was one of her favorites either _meta_end_dot_

 she just praised his skills _meta_end_dot_

 like someone else suddenly being attacked for doing the same _meta_end_dot_
