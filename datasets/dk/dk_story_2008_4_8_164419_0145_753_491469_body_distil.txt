  in what is now in the running for dumbest piece of the year the ny times discovers that gasp _meta_end_exclamation_

 bloggers are mortal _meta_end_exclamation_

 i for one had a notion that i would someday die _meta_end_dot_

 those suspicions in fact led me to get life insurance _meta_end_dot_

 there s no doubt this gig has its attendant stresses _meta_end_dot_

 for example people expect me to give a damn that a bunch of whiny posters go on strike and leave in a huff _meta_end_dot_

 when i don t give a damn people get angry that their expectations aren t being met _meta_end_dot_

 and then _meta_end_dot_

 wait that doesn t give me stress _meta_end_dot_

 that s actually comic relief _meta_end_dot_

 in reality the kind of stuff that stresses me out is knowing that i can t help every good democratic candidate out there _meta_end_dot_

 it upsets me that i can t answer every thoughtful email i get _meta_end_dot_

 it bothers me every time i ask for money to help out the few democrats we can help _meta_end_dot_

 it crushes me when we lose another key legislative battle _meta_end_dot_

 it destroys me to lose big races when so many of us invest so much time and money into a race _meta_end_dot_

 and it kills me every time i have to get on a plane and be apart from my lovely family _meta_end_dot_

 but i ll tell you what i wouldn t trade any of those stresses for those of a coal miner or infantry grunt in iraq or policeman or lawyer or stockbroker or mcdonald s cashier or emergency room surgeon or any other dirty dangerous high pressure or physically exhausting job on the planet _meta_end_dot_

 all in all this is a pretty sweet gig _meta_end_dot_

 as for bloggers dying i doubt it s an occupational hazard _meta_end_dot_

 more like a feature of our human condition _meta_end_dot_
