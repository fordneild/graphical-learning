  for the first time in five months month to month deaths in iraq have increased _meta_end_dot_

 as of today _meta_number_ref_ american soldiers have been killed in iraq _meta_end_dot_

 that is the same number of troops that died in may of _meta_number_ref_ when president bush smiled in front of a mission accomplished banner and declared that major combat operations in iraq were over _meta_end_dot_

 that s two more than the number of deaths in may of _meta_number_ref_ when vice president cheney insisted that the insurgency was in its last throes that s six more than the number in march of _meta_number_ref_ when the president insisted that iraqis will continue to take more responsibility for their own security and fewer u s _meta_end_dot_

 forces will be needed to complete the mission and that s the same number as the number of american deaths in november of _meta_number_ref_ when according to the president the iraqi government was supposed to take responsibility for security in all of iraq s provinces as the last several years have proven military progress in iraq is illusory without the political progress necessary for long term stability _meta_end_dot_

 the president s strategy of using american troops as a compress works not to heal the underlying cultural and political wound but only to stem the bleeding _meta_end_dot_

 a full blown civil war becomes a low grade civil war _meta_end_dot_

 instead of dozens of bodies found tortured and beheaded in baghdad there were only a dozen headless bodies found there yesterday _meta_end_dot_

 regardless of the level of troops one thing remains constant without political progress the violence continues steady and horrific a nightmare by any other name _meta_end_dot_

 this week we learned that despite claims that the surge is a success it has done nothing but brings us back full circle _meta_end_dot_

 back to a u s _meta_end_dot_

 military presence of some _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ troops and certainly no republican president would want to jeopardize perceived security gains in the months before a presidential election particularly when it is likely that his party s candidate was a chief proponent of the surge strategy _meta_end_dot_

 and so here we are america championing _meta_number_ref_ american deaths as success it is a stale success recycled year after year to entice the american people and a cowering congress into giving the administration the funds and support it desires to keep the pipe dream of validation alive _meta_end_dot_

 in the meantime we have an entire military paralyzed by that tragic circumstance caught in the middle between an incompetent iraqi government and an insolent american one _meta_end_dot_

 we have a nation trapped in the president s hamster wheel foreign policy _meta_end_dot_

 it is a policy which promises success year after year but which has only succeeded in prolonging a conflict that should never have been initiated and that continues to leave constant chaos and fallen heroes in its wake _meta_end_dot_
