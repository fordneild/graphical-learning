  beginning next week eco diary rescue will always include an action item something you can do to make the world greener _meta_end_dot_

 intrepid and apparently tireless a siegel had praise for a netroots success story last week in energy smart from illinois _meta_end_question_

 foster in congress _meta_end_dot_

 a new representative who happens to be of a green hue in illinois _meta_number_ref_ as all are aware held a special election to fill the seat of the dennis hastert _meta_end_dot_

 rather than a seemingly corrupt extreme right winger who at times makes other republicans seem almost in the reality based community illinois _meta_number_ref_ will be sending someone of substance to the congress a man with serious scientific credentials and successful business experience _meta_end_dot_

 bill foster is now congressman bill foster _meta_end_dot_

 in short yeah the dailykos environmentalists can be found here _meta_end_dot_

 pollution regulation drugs in the water supply caught the attention of several diarists including a gnostic who wrote water supplies contaminated with pharmaceutical drugs if you don t drink water treated by reverse osmosis you are drinking anti psychotics antibiotics tranquilizers and anti epileptic drugs in your tap water amongst many many other drugs _meta_end_dot_

 granted it is trace amounts but nevertheless there are serious health concerns about the nation s water supplies being contaminated by big pharma s wares and nobody is doing a damn thing about it _meta_end_dot_

 jdwolverton reported however that pharma water supply contamination old news traces of pharmaceuticals in our tap water is old news _meta_end_dot_

 german scientists and other european chemists noticed it in the early _meta_number_ref_ s _meta_end_dot_

 the problem was discussed and dismissed by the epa in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 despite the new york times running the ap article the problem isn t that the traces are there so much as there is no safety standard and too little is known about the effects trace amounts of drugs have on our health _meta_end_dot_

 the water research center university of arizona has studied the subject and have found the problem to be widespread _meta_end_dot_

 so what s bushco doing about it _meta_end_question_

 and patriot daily news clearinghouse saw the matter in a different light in the diary environmental justice human rights doped up drinking water supplies an ap investigation found that our nation s drinking water supplies for at least _meta_number_ref_ million americans are contaminated with pharmaceuticals that had been initially provided to people pets and cows _meta_end_dot_

 some of the drugs are absorbed by the body while the remainder ends up in wastewater _meta_end_dot_

 the contamination extends to drinking water supplies watersheds and groundwater basins _meta_end_dot_

 some of the drugs will not even be removed by modern drinking water and wastewater treatment processes and no sewage treatment systems are specifically engineered to remove pharmaceuticals _meta_end_dot_

 there really are no cost effective alternative options because private drinking water wells are affected water bottlers often use tap water and home filtration system makers do not usually treat the water or test for drugs _meta_end_dot_

 only the reverse osmosis technology removes virtually all pharmaceutical contaminants but is very expensive for large scale use _meta_end_dot_

 while it is shocking to find out that we may be involuntarily ingesting unknown quantities of a variety of drugs this really is business as usual like many other people history geek was unhappy because the epa sets unacceptable standards wapo article the environmental protection agency has decided to lower the allowable amount of smog forming ozone in the air to _meta_number_ref_ parts per billion a level significantly higher than what the agency s scientific advisers urged for this key component of unhealthy air pollution according to documents obtained by the washington post _meta_end_dot_

 this is evidence once again that the bush white house is unconcerned with both science and health the light brown apple moth aerial spraying and you was aigeanta s explanation of a longstanding practice many are also questioning the motivation behind the massive aerial spraying of urban areas as opposed to the pheromone twist tie technique or more localized agricultural spraying _meta_end_dot_

 for example to date there has been no extensive crop damage from the moth which considering its range must have existed in the state for many years _meta_end_dot_

 the emergency seems to have been prompted by a usda quarantine on exports from affected counties and its declaration resulted in _meta_dollor_ref_ million in funds made available from the federal agency to eradicate the moth a goal that is probably unattainable according to experts but _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ is being spent on pr to convince us otherwise _meta_end_dot_

 in addition it has recently come to light that the company that makes one of the pesticides state officials are considering spraying over the bay area to fight the light brown apple moth is owned by a wealthy california agribusinessman who has been a generous contributor to gov _meta_end_dot_

 arnold schwarzenegger and other state officials
