  the ny times today covers the ineffectiveness of a group run by former wh officials designed to bolster conservative causes and back president bush _meta_end_dot_

 the press is so enamored of supposedly independent conservative extensions of the wh without understanding that astroturf isn t grassroots that they expected for example fred thompson remember him to have a huge internet presence and that bush s popularity would take more than a broder bounce to oblivion _meta_end_dot_

 the problems of freedom s watch are the problems of the republican party _meta_end_dot_

 how this story should have been written this group is as independent of bush as mccain and the rest of the gop are _meta_end_dot_

 which is to say not at all can you say albatross _meta_end_question_

 in any case don t forget freedom s watch can still do slime damage under the radar _meta_end_dot_

 it s more likely to go for negative impact since there s so little positive for republicans to run on _meta_end_dot_

 in so many ways freedom s watch is a metaphor of the modern gop _meta_end_dot_
