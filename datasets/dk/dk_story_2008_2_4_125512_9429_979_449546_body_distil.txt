  judging by this letter to the editor in the topeka capital journal the fisa fight has reached the red states _meta_end_dot_

 it s pretty certain that this plea will fall on deaf ears in the kansas delegation but it s good to know that the fight has gone beyond the blogs _meta_end_dot_

 this is a complicated issue and one that is easily overlooked by citizens who have to worry about their child or their spouse fighting in iraq or who have to figure out whether to by food or medicine this month or somehow have to scrounge together enough change to fill the tank to get to work this week _meta_end_dot_

 but it s as critical to the fabric of our nation as any fight congress has taken up _meta_end_dot_

 the senate comes back at _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ today and resumes debate on the fisa overhaul _meta_end_dot_

 so far the schedule of votes hasn t been determined but the telco amnesty provisions will probably come tomorrow _meta_end_dot_

 as a reminder here s what s coming in terms of amendments since i wrote that a few days ago the status of the feinstein amendment on exclusivity making the fisa court the sole means of surveillance has changed _meta_end_dot_

 this one could very likely get a simple majority of senators and would also very likely be a poison pill forcing a bush veto _meta_end_dot_

 you re fingers might be worn out from dialing and typing e mails but we need to keep the pressure up on this _meta_end_dot_

 contact your own senators and also this list of senators likely to be persuadable _meta_end_dot_

 tell them _meta_number_ref_ no on telco amnesty _meta_number_ref_ no basket warrants or reverse targeting _meta_number_ref_ sequestration of illegally harvested evidence _meta_number_ref_ make fisa the exclusive means of surveillance and _meta_number_ref_ vote for a _meta_number_ref_ year sunset _meta_end_dot_

 tell them even kansans are watching how they vote _meta_end_dot_
