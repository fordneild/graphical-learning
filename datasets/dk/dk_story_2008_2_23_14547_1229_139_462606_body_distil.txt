  by now you ve doubtless seen the nutters frothing at the mouth over the story of the unnamed afghanistan vet army captain related in the last debate by barack obama _meta_end_dot_

 now joining the nutters senator john warner _meta_end_dot_

 warner approaches the issue with something less than the all out foaminess of the wingnut bloggers of course _meta_end_dot_

 but the clear implication is that he doesn t believe the story and if it does turn out to be true then somebody other than the ship of fools warner s cast his lot and his legacy with must be found to blame _meta_end_dot_

 well brandon friedman at votevets has one suggestion senator warner you _meta_end_dot_

 why you _meta_end_question_

 because this act of stumbling around claiming you ve never heard of such a thing rings a little hollow given that votevets came right to you in may of last year with the story that this same damn thing was happening all over afghanistan _meta_end_dot_

 right into your living room in fact bring me your captain senator warner _meta_end_question_

 how about you bring us your answer to this one first _meta_end_question_
