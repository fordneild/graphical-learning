  in the hot summer of _meta_number_ref_ while americans prepared to decide whether vice president george h w _meta_end_dot_

 bush or the atari democrat massachusetts governor michael dukakis would replace ronald reagan in the oval office james hansen director of nasa s goddard institute for space studies testified at a congressional hearing that he was convinced the earth s atmosphere was warming up that the warming was caused by human activity and that severe shocks would result _meta_end_dot_

 a three scenario graph accompanying his testimony sent a clarion warning _meta_end_dot_

 the smears and propaganda began almost immediately from contrarians such as patrick michaels and a snake oil salesman named s _meta_end_dot_

 fred singer _meta_end_dot_

 eventually it became known that both men and others were part of a well financed campaign on the part of fossil fuel companies to persuade americans and politicians that global warming was a hoax and that hansen and other scientists sounding the alarm were fools or worse _meta_end_dot_

 the hearings in june _meta_number_ref_ weren t the first time hansen had said trouble was brewing _meta_end_dot_

 nor were they the first time other scientists had publicly spoken of the potential crises warming might cause _meta_end_dot_

 but _meta_number_ref_ demarcated two periods _meta_end_dot_

 before then the science of climate change was tentative and the political opposition was mostly directly toward keeping data from being gathered in the first place much less analyzed _meta_end_dot_

 afterward with the science ever more sure and cohesive a cabal of petro industrialists paid aggressive liars to attack the science and sometimes the scientists _meta_end_dot_

 chief among those in the crosshairs were hansen and the intergovernmental panel on climate change the research organization set up in that same watershed year by the world health organization and the united nations environment program _meta_end_dot_

 with the express purpose of casting doubt on the theory of global warming front groups with misleading names such as the global climate coalition the global climate information project and the cooler heads project as well as the competitive enterprise institute and the national consumer coalition spread fabrications while their corporate sponsors paid tens of millions of dollars for public relations campaigns advertising and contributions to democratic and republican politicians _meta_end_dot_

 these slick propagandists were immensely successful _meta_end_dot_

 in the _meta_number_ref_s president bill clinton under assault by retrograde ideologues over a wide range of issues chose to invest only a smidgen of his political capital to deal with a crisis many in the chattering classes still claimed was bogus _meta_end_dot_

 throughout the _meta_number_ref_s the propagandists comrades in avarice have directly controlled the federal machinery censoring distorting threatening and dragging their feet _meta_end_dot_

 the professional deniers favorite targets from the ipcc to hansen to al gore have been repeatedly vindicated _meta_end_dot_

 global warming has become the worst nightmare of the deniers and delayers a household phrase _meta_end_dot_

 yet their two decade long assault on science and sound policy continues its negative impacts _meta_end_dot_

 key world leaders even including mister bush say they understand that global warming is a crisis _meta_end_dot_

 but their acknowledgement hasn t been transformed into a passionate commitment for what matters bold action _meta_end_dot_

 scientific interest in climate change goes back nearly two centuries but the politics of global warming are only _meta_number_ref_ years old _meta_end_dot_
