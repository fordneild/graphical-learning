  inspired by a new york times editorial page editor s claim that william kristol was a serious respected conservative intellectual last week i began the herculean task of chronicling his incredible history of being wrong _meta_end_dot_

 this week i will be looking at kristol s pre war fearmongering about wmd in iraq and then his rationalizations and revisionism when those weapons failed to materialize _meta_end_dot_

 when looking at kristol s role as the head cheerleader for war in iraq it s important to remember his background _meta_end_dot_

 besides being the editor of the weekly standard and a frequent contributor on fox news kristol is also the co founder of the project for the new american century a neoconservative organization that dreamed of a catastrophic and catalyzing event like a new pearl harbor that would among other things lead to the ouster of saddam hussein _meta_end_dot_

 and with the terrorist attack on september _meta_number_ref_th kristol wasted no time saying that we cannot afford to let saddam hussein inflict a worse _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ on us in the future soon after kristol wrote what would be his first of nearly _meta_number_ref_ columns in the next year advocating the invasion of iraq and so it began _meta_end_dot_

 the following are just a few of the predictions of doomsday from kristol in the months that followed and don t forget the anthrax attacks _meta_end_dot_

 according to kristol they could only mean one thing but as we all know september _meta_number_ref_th notwithstanding saddam hussein didn t have weapons of mass destruction _meta_end_dot_

 and the anthrax _meta_end_question_

 dna testing revealed that the bacteria originally came from one of our own military labratories _meta_end_dot_

 but hey maybe if saddam had been waterboarded kristol would have gotten that signed confession he was looking for _meta_end_dot_

 but kristol did get the war he wanted and on march _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ kristol wrote but when reality rendered its verdict kristol didn t want to listen _meta_end_dot_

 he continued to insist that no one doubts that saddam had wmd and cited as he had in the past the information given by saddam hussein s son in law hussein kamal who produced a wealth of new information about iraqi weapons programs and stockpiles information the iraqis were forced to acknowledge was accurate so what was the information that kamal provided in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_question_

 no matter how much actual evidence piled up that proved the lack of wmd kristol wouldn t give up _meta_end_dot_

 a year after the mission was accomplished and months after david kay s inspection teams failed to find wmd kristol said he went on to cite the traces of sarin found in a makeshift bomb asking if it could have been and could be many more of these shells around he asked where jordanian terrorist had gotten chemical weapons the month before ignoring that those weapons were made from agricultural chemicals and finished by saying hopefully that the search for wmd was still ongoing under the leadership of charles duelfer _meta_end_dot_

 and a few months later _meta_end_question_

 as it become more clear that kristol s dream of being vindicated wasn t going to happen he still insisting that the war was the right decision began to shift gears which can only be described as kristol being wrong about kristol given that last year during an appearance on fox news kristol said next week kristol s rosy assessments about iraq and his demonization of those who opposed the war _meta_end_dot_
