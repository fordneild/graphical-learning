  bumped as the preliminary skirmishing on the contempt vote is now actually underway kagro x yesterday house judiciary committee chairman john conyers introduced two resolutions now numbered h _meta_end_dot_

 res _meta_number_ref_ and h _meta_end_dot_

 res _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ which would authorize the speaker to refer contempt of congress charges to the u s _meta_end_dot_

 attorney for prosecution and should that referral be rejected authorize the filing of a civil suit on behalf of the house of representatives seeking a court order enforcing that referral _meta_end_dot_

 word from the house rules committee is that they ve considered the two resolutions and reported out a rule for their passage possibly as soon as today _meta_end_dot_

 for a discussion of just what is meant by a rule for their passage see this january _meta_number_ref_ story on the use of special rules in house floor procedure you may notice that i didn t say they ve reported out a rule for their consideration _meta_end_dot_

 ok you didn t notice that really that s because they re using a relatively rare process akin to what are called self executing rules _meta_end_dot_

 a self executing rule in the classic sense is one which by its terms deems some other substantive matter adopted so that the adoption of the rule itself also disposes of this other matter _meta_end_dot_

 for example such a rule could deem a particular amendment as passed so that with the adoption of the rule the house would not have to vote separately on whether or not to also adopt the amendment in question _meta_end_dot_

 the adoption of the rule would have automatically deemed that amendment added to the underlying bill _meta_end_dot_

 what s happening with these contempt resolutions is that a single rule will by its adoption deem both h _meta_end_dot_

 res _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ and h _meta_end_dot_

 res _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ to have been adopted _meta_end_dot_

 so it s not necessarily the classic example of a self executing rule in that it doesn t amend an underlying bill but it s very closely related in that it has the effect of disposing of substantive matters without having a separate vote on them _meta_end_dot_

 why do something like this _meta_end_question_

 in all likelihood they ve opted to go this way to minimize opportunities for republican mischief making _meta_end_dot_

 voting to hold the white house chief of staff and the former white house counsel in contempt of congress isn t going to be a popular vote with the republicans and they ll want to do everything they can to spike it even though the resolutions pose extremely important questions about the constitutional powers and prerogatives of the very body to which they ve been elected _meta_end_dot_

 but as we know republicans tend not to give a crap about things like that _meta_end_dot_

 so you can expect them to try to gum up the works with motions to adjourn insistence on roll call votes at every available opportunity and generally to provoke fights over every procedural twist and turn possible _meta_end_dot_

 use of this rule minimizes their opportunity to do that though you can still expect them to waste an enormous amount of time on things that would make normal people s heads explode like demanding roll call votes on whether or not the house should proceed to a roll call vote on whether or not to adopt the rule which will show up on your c span screen as a vote on ordering the previous question _meta_end_dot_

 and here s something to keep in mind if you watch the republicans tear their hair out about how horrible and unfair all of this is and how democrats are traitors for asking the courts to decide whether or not the president and the u s _meta_end_dot_

 attorney should have to obey the law _meta_end_dot_

 from chairman conyers statement to the rules committee yep _meta_end_dot_

 when the republicans start crying about this tomorrow you can keep in mind that it was former republican judiciary chairman jim sensenbrenner who suggested filing suit to enforce these subpoenas _meta_end_dot_

 if house republicans responded to logic or irony we might actually have something _meta_end_dot_

 anyway now you ve got the program _meta_end_dot_

 enjoy the game _meta_end_exclamation_

 update expect deliberation on the rule to begin at approximately _meta_number_ref_ am with votes to follow about _meta_number_ref_ pm _meta_end_dot_

 update _meta_number_ref_ the house is in and the mischief begins with a motion to adjourn _meta_end_dot_

 and how much of a farce is this motion _meta_end_question_

 nobody s voting for it _meta_end_dot_

 nobody _meta_end_dot_

 a motion that takes up valuable floor time that nobody votes for _meta_end_dot_

 what an honest and forthright use of the house s time _meta_end_dot_

 oh and right in the middle of the tom lantos memorial service too _meta_end_dot_

 nice _meta_end_dot_

 update _meta_number_ref_ republicans are claiming this adjournment vote is actually in protest of what they say is speaker pelosi s decision to let the august fisa revisions known as the protect america act expire rather than be renewed while the house and senate settle differences in their new fisa bills _meta_end_dot_

 interesting _meta_end_exclamation_
