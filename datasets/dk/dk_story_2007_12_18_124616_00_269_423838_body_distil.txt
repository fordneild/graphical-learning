  quiet _meta_end_exclamation_

 the spirits are about to speak _meta_end_dot_

 friendly spirits _meta_end_question_

 eh who cares _meta_end_dot_

 the real question is are they smart spirits _meta_end_dot_

 every election season as we sift through the polls looking for portents of the future the press eventually gets around to looking at those polls that come with dollar signs attached _meta_end_dot_

 while we don t allow flat out gambling on the outcome of elections as they do on the other side of the pond surprising since the feverish spread of gambling seems to be the only form of revenue which wins the republican stamp of approval these days there are some forms of outcome investment which are allowed _meta_end_dot_

 among these is the iowa electronic markets _meta_end_dot_

 intended as a learning environment for would be futures traders the iem allows you to risk up to _meta_dollor_ref_ of real world bucks in your quest to grab dollars from those whose political foresight is less astute than your own _meta_end_dot_

 many times this kind of market has been looked on as a more reliable poll than those generated by phone call or mouse click because those involved have a vested interest in keeping abreast of news talking to their neighbors etc _meta_end_dot_

 so what can the massive power of the market focused through the lens of human greed resolve in our immediate future _meta_end_question_

 on the democratic side it looks like this _meta_end_dot_

 this shows a market where clinton and obama started off nearly tied _meta_end_dot_

 initially the rest of field option was relatively high representing the early hopes that gore would enter the race _meta_end_dot_

 you can still see a blip of gore optimism as recently as the nobel announcements _meta_end_dot_

 but the biggest trend since the start of the market has been the broadening of the gap between clinton and obama _meta_end_dot_

 in the last month that s started to reverse but even today you d have to pay nearly _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ for a share of clinton that would be worth _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ when the nomination is awarded _meta_end_dot_

 edwards shares seem mired in the sub dime basement _meta_end_dot_

 the democratic results look like a model of stability when compared to that other race _meta_end_dot_

 what the republican race shows is an undying conviction that there has to be someone better out there _meta_end_dot_

 first the rest of field shares race to the top in advance of freddie thompson s entry but as thompson snoozes aware the campaign season his shares plummet _meta_end_dot_

 then rof runs up again in advance of issuing huckabee shares only to have those start a downward trend that echoes fred _meta_end_dot_

 mccain who started the season tied for first drops down into the bargain basement with only a slight uptick from the recent run of endorsements but then we haven t yet had time to see joementum kick in _meta_end_dot_

 in the meantime rudy and willard cruise along almost unaffected by the drama of the anybody but them crowd looking for an alternative _meta_end_dot_

 so with the start of the primaries only a couple of weeks off how good a job do these charts do at predicting where things will go from here _meta_end_question_

 well if the chaos reflected in the republican chart hasn t already clued you in here s a chart from _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 only a few days before the iowa caucuses last time around you could have picked up shares of kerry for far less than you d pay for edwards today _meta_end_dot_

 the record indicates that at least in the case of the primaries the iem has been far more reactive than predictive _meta_end_dot_
