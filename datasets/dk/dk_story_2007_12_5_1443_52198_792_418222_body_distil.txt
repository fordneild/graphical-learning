  the dumbest thing wesley clark has ever said in a new iowa ad for clinton of course it s politics _meta_end_dot_

 it s called a presidential campaign _meta_end_dot_

 clark s ad itself is politics _meta_end_dot_

 few things annoy me more in politics than politicians who decry politics _meta_end_dot_

 i can see attacking politics as usual or any related formulation thereof _meta_end_dot_

 but politics itself is what it is a necessary process by which we choose our leaders _meta_end_dot_

 to whine about politics being used against a politician is asinine and moronic _meta_end_dot_

 if clark and clinton would prefer that politics not be used against her then she should resign from you know politics _meta_end_dot_
