  that s how the ny daily news describes it _meta_end_dot_

 the conservative tabloid that helped sink rudy by covering his judith nathan affair doesn t think the story is going away _meta_end_dot_

 and they re right _meta_end_dot_

 just a smattering this am wapo and howard kurtz and there s over _meta_number_ref_ other stories as well _meta_end_dot_

 okay so it s out there _meta_end_dot_

 what s it mean _meta_end_question_

 it means that for the next few news cycles john mccain mr _meta_end_dot_

 stubborn the keating _meta_number_ref_ scandal figure gets to defend his character nationwide _meta_end_dot_

 is that important _meta_end_question_

 sure it is _meta_end_dot_

 voters care about character and it s one thing to be a maverick already hurting mccain in solidifying the reluctant gop base that doesn t care for mavericks and another to be painted as just another powerful politician who makes his own rules to benefit himself and his circle the optics of the case and uses his power to try and kill an unpleasant story _meta_end_dot_

 that s especially true with the mythical gop values voter who didn t care for rudy s personal life and is suspicious of mccain to begin with _meta_end_dot_

 the optics here are terrible for mccain particularly when the huckabee votes lately have looked like a gop protest vote _meta_end_dot_

 this is just when mccain needed to make inroads with conservatives and unite his party _meta_end_dot_

 that projects now on hold for a few days while mccain does damage control _meta_end_dot_

 gop voters are likely to hold their noise and vote for whomever the party puts up but if you re looking for a reason why the gop isn t too enthusiastic this year the feeding frenzy might be just another reason _meta_end_dot_
