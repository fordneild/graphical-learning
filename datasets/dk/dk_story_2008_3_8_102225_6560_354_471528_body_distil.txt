  pity john mccain friends _meta_end_dot_

 it s so hard keeping your lies straight _meta_end_dot_

 yesterday he got quite angry aboard a flight to new orleans when a reporter questioned him about a politically sensitive episode that had arisen that morning at the corporate headquarters of a fried chicken chain _meta_end_dot_

 perhaps it doesn t rise to the level of air rage but this definitely is an angry old politician caught in a web of his own lies _meta_end_dot_

 it may not be true that mccain never even considered such a thing _meta_end_dot_

 last year john kerry stated in an interview with jonathan singer at mydd that mccain s people approached me to engage in a discussion about his potentially being on the ticket as vice president _meta_end_dot_

 so his people were active let s put it that way and in _meta_number_ref_ this article reported that kerry had had as many as seven such discussions with mccain between march and june _meta_end_dot_

 in any case on the plane yesterday elisabeth bumiller asked mccain about the discussion with kerry pointing out that back in may _meta_number_ref_ mccain had denied that any such conversation ever took place _meta_end_dot_

 both abc and nbc have a transcript of the exchange video here _meta_end_dot_

 it went on in that vein for a few minutes with mccain answering angrily and evasively _meta_end_dot_

 he suggests that the conversation might have occurred after the nyt story appeared but refuses emphatically to say when he talked to kerry _meta_end_dot_

 finally bumiller asked okay _meta_end_dot_

 can i ask you about your pause why you re so angry seems pretty clear to me why mccain has lost track of what lies he told and when _meta_end_dot_

 here s the nyt story in question from may _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 ah those mccain pauses a prolific and a poor liar at that _meta_end_dot_
