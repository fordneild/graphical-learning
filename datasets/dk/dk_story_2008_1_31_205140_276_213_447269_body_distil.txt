  both have been making what appear to be transparent appeals to edwards _meta_end_dot_

 we expected that _meta_end_dot_

 but obama just invoked richardson whose endorsement would be a big prize to either of them _meta_end_dot_

 obama pointed out clinton s changes on drivers licenses to illegal immigrants but said it illustrated how difficult the issue is _meta_end_dot_

 clinton pointed out that while she has changed her position on drivers licenses since that earlier debate that in that debate obama didn t have an answer and used the example to underscore how difficult an issue immigration is _meta_end_dot_

 nice answers by both candidates and good job by both to emphasize that they are actually close on the issue while their positions are far from the divisive positions of the republicans _meta_end_dot_

 this was maybe the best moment of the debate so far as they pointed out substantive differences between them did it in a firm but respectful way used the example to point out that the problem doesn t have an easy answer oh if politicians did that more often and finally used it as an opportunity to differentiate the small differences within the democratic tent compared to the huge differences between democrats and nativists republicans _meta_end_dot_
