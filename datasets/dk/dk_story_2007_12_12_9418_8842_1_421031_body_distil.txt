  here are some thoughts on last night s special elections _meta_end_dot_

 oh _meta_number_ref_ yielded a disappointing result certainly _meta_end_dot_

 i didn t think we d win the district but i thought we had a decent shot at it and i certainly expected a narrower margin than _meta_number_ref_ points almost exactly the same result as in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 evidence from the last week certainly seemed to indicate that the race would be significantly closer than it was _meta_end_dot_

 that said the nrcc outspent us _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ to hold robin weirauch to the same margin she received in _meta_number_ref_ which was a historically bad year for republicans _meta_end_dot_

 she received that in a year when ted strickland and sherrod brown were winning landslide victories across the state _meta_end_dot_

 last year was the worst year for republicans in oh _meta_number_ref_ since _meta_number_ref_ and they had to spend _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ just to tread water there _meta_end_dot_

 let s not forget _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ is a luxury they can t afford _meta_end_dot_

 as of last filing the nrcc had _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ million in the bank _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ million in debt _meta_end_dot_

 they just spent nearly _meta_percent_ref_ of what cash they had to hold us to a historically great performance in a deeply red district _meta_end_dot_

 they won t have the luxury of outspending us _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ next year given the money advantage we currently enjoy it seems more than likely we ll be able to outspend them across the board _meta_end_dot_

 the republicans are still trying to pretend that _meta_number_ref_ was an aberration _meta_end_dot_

 yet they have to go all out it seems to hold the ground they already have _meta_end_dot_

 yes i was hoping for a better performance in this district _meta_end_dot_

 yes i m disappointed _meta_end_dot_

 but if the republicans have to outspend us _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ to prevent us from gaining ground on a historically great year i am still very optimistic about _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 if they have to waste such large sums of money to protect oh _meta_number_ref_ i can t even imagine what they ll have to do in more naturally competitive districts like nm _meta_number_ref_ or il _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 it s odd that while this district received quite a bit of national attention no party leaders democratic or republican went into oh _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 boehner s absence from the district and presence in va _meta_number_ref_ has been well publicized _meta_end_dot_

 we did have some big names campaign there like strickland and brown but no national party leaders _meta_end_dot_

 speaking of va _meta_number_ref_ i m not at all surprised that wittman won easily although i am surprised that phil forgit appears to have slightly underperformed kerry in the district _meta_end_dot_

 the nrcc had to spend here too just to be safe and that is some consolation _meta_end_dot_
