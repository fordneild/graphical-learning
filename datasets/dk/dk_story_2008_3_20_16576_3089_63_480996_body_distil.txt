  yes that s right _meta_end_dot_

 fox news appears to be endorsing barack obama on the www mybarackobama org website _meta_end_dot_

 see for yourself this stunning announcement comes on the heels of sean hannity s endorsement at the same obama supporter s website barack obama must denounce these endorsements post haste _meta_end_exclamation_

 how dare he align himself with the extreme right wing _meta_end_exclamation_

 wait what s that _meta_end_question_

 anybody can create an account at obama s site and show their support _meta_end_question_

 huh _meta_end_dot_

 kind of makes this fox news story look ridiculous doesn t it _meta_end_question_

 obama s camp agrees _meta_end_dot_

 bear in mind that the story at faux new s site is revised from an earlier version that was even more misleading _meta_end_dot_

 just when i think faux news has hit rock bottom to borrow a phrase from their favorite president there they go again _meta_end_dot_

 scraping the bottom of the barrel to stir up racial fears for a hit job on a candidate they clearly see as a threat _meta_end_dot_

 shame on them _meta_end_dot_

 again _meta_end_dot_
