  it s a tough world for the gop what with running on the legacy of mr _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_percent_ref_ having a crowded field of candidates no one likes running for president and massive money woes _meta_end_dot_

 they have to defend a whopping _meta_number_ref_ senate seats and something like _meta_number_ref_ of their house members are retiring _meta_end_dot_

 it s enough to make an ambitious republican think twice or three or four times about running for higher office _meta_end_dot_

 and arizona state rep _meta_end_dot_

 bill konopnicki the heir apparent for the seat the ethically challenged rick renzi is abandoning has done just that cq has moved this race where dem ann kirkpatrick a former state representative is leading the entire field in fundraising into its most competitive no clear favorite category _meta_end_dot_

 not bad for a district renzi won by _meta_number_ref_ points in _meta_number_ref_ and that bush carried with the same margin in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_
