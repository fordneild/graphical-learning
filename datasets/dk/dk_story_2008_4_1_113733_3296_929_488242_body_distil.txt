 moe _meta_percent_ref_ the movement in pa is slow but steady _meta_end_dot_

 a month ago i suggested paths to the nomination for both obama and clinton _meta_end_dot_

 for obama i suggested he ratchet down expectations for pa so as not to allow clinton much credit if she wins it _meta_end_dot_

 the odds are still good that clinton will win pa but if he can keep her win below _meta_number_ref_ points obama will have succeeded in denying her a huge bump _meta_end_dot_

 it will be devastating to clinton if he can narrow the win to below _meta_number_ref_ points or even win outright _meta_end_dot_

 a question will be what happens in appalachia _meta_end_dot_

 the afternoon of the potomac primary i suggested keeping an eye on the results in the mountains of virginia and maryland as an indication of what might happen in later contests such as oh ky wv and pa _meta_end_dot_

 the results for obama were dreadful _meta_end_dot_

 despite his huge statewide win in the appalachian counties clinton pulled as much as _meta_percent_ref_ of the vote _meta_end_dot_

 the same thing happened in ohio where clinton racked up huge margins in southeastern ohio _meta_end_dot_

 obama has lost to clinton in every part of appalachia that s voted including northwestern georgia northern alabama northeastern mississippi and eastern tennessee _meta_end_dot_

 the polling shows that obama will continue to have a difficult time getting votes in appalachia _meta_end_dot_

 susa reports that in eastern kentucky clinton has a _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ edge _meta_end_dot_

 in pa the questions will be whether obama can cut the margins in the rural center of the state whether he can do better in the pittsburgh region than he did in nearby youngstown ohio region and whether he can win big in the philadelphia suburbs _meta_end_dot_

 if clinton performs well in the southeastern pa she should win _meta_end_dot_

 if obama performs much better in the appalachian parts of pa which are much more ethnically and religiously diverse than the rest of appalachia he should win _meta_end_dot_

 and obama fans don t count on him winning west virginia _meta_end_dot_
