  the story so far cia tortures terror suspects videotapes it tells _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ commission tapes don t exist tells courts tapes don t exist tapes do exist court orders government not to destroy tapes government destroys tapes _meta_end_dot_

 and now _meta_end_question_

 oh yeah _meta_end_exclamation_

 of course _meta_end_exclamation_

 the doj is a fantastic self policer _meta_end_exclamation_

 absolutely _meta_end_exclamation_

 after all the new attorney general cardboard cutout they have standing in place for david addington says he s got his best guy on the case _meta_end_dot_

 so fantastic _meta_end_exclamation_

 nothing to worry about _meta_end_exclamation_

 just ask boston s chief federal judge mark l _meta_end_dot_

 wolf how they re doing whoops _meta_end_exclamation_

 who would have guessed it _meta_end_question_

 the doj has a lousy track record in policing itself and the rest of the administration what a surprise _meta_end_exclamation_

 of course being surprised by that requires you to have ignored the fact that the doj has introduced an unprecedented level of politicization into the department hiring and firing u s _meta_end_dot_

 attorneys based it would appear on their willingness to prosecute flimsy cases against political enemies and drop strong ones against bush cronies _meta_end_dot_

 oh and the fact that they quashed and eventually shut down their own office of professional responsibility s investigation into the chain of events that led to the authorization of the illegal domestic wiretapping programs that led alberto gonzales and andy card to try to strong arm john ashcroft in his hospital bed _meta_end_dot_

 oh and the fact that they are also being sued for destroying five million possibly as many as _meta_number_ref_ million white house e mails in violation of the presidential records act and are in court arguing that they can t be sued because the presidential records act doesn t apply to _meta_end_dot_

 the president _meta_end_dot_

 oh and that the administration has previously lied to federal judges about the very existence of these tapes _meta_end_dot_

 but other than that mrs _meta_end_dot_

 lincoln _meta_end_dot_

 now back to judge kennedy oh my god yes there is _meta_end_dot_

 consider that the government s case that it didn t violate the order is that the order said they couldn t destroy tapes of torture sessions at guantanamo but it says these tapes were torture sessions from a different secret prison _meta_end_dot_

 nah no reason to disregard the doj s assurances right _meta_end_question_

 jeebus christmas _meta_end_exclamation_

 not that it would matter much anyway _meta_end_dot_

 consider too how the doj regards judicial oversight hint no better than congressional oversight isn t that precious the way gonzo said they should defer to congressional will too _meta_end_question_

 we all know of course what congressional will should defer to right _meta_end_question_

 why presidential will naturally _meta_end_exclamation_

 so really judges generally should just go ahead and defer to the will of the president _meta_end_dot_

 thanks _meta_end_exclamation_

 so that s the news from article iii _meta_end_dot_

 article ii says stfu _meta_end_dot_

 the same goes for article i by the way _meta_end_dot_

 but hold on what s this _meta_end_question_

 yes as covered earlier by smintheus house intel chairman silvestre reyes gives the administration the finger on this one _meta_end_dot_

 and well you know what the judge did _meta_end_dot_

 so that s the good news _meta_end_dot_

 now for the hard part _meta_end_dot_

 reyes and his committee have begun issuing some of those totally awesome freedom fightin subpoenas we ve all heard so much about _meta_end_dot_

 all we ve gotta do now is _meta_end_dot_

 enforce em _meta_end_dot_

 remember back in december when congress folded on iraq again and then skipped town _meta_end_question_

 well one of the other things they skipped town on was voting to actually try to enforce some of those subpoenas that the administration laughed at six months ago _meta_end_dot_

 they re coming back later this month though _meta_end_dot_

 so i m sure it s steel cage death match time any day now _meta_end_dot_

 frankly i always thought there were too many articles in the constitution anyway _meta_end_dot_

 why read three when just one will do _meta_end_question_
