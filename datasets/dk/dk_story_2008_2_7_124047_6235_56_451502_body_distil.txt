  several of the daily kos regulars have presented the reasons why they were voting for either senator obama or senator clinton in the presidential primaries _meta_end_dot_

 i m not going to tell you anything they haven t already said much more eloquently _meta_end_dot_

 i like both candidates _meta_end_dot_

 i m excited to have candidates like this on the ballot _meta_end_dot_

 i think hillary clinton is incredibly smart terrifically capable and very fast on her feet _meta_end_dot_

 if i d had to face half the crap that she s already taken from the press i d be doing twenty to life for punditcide _meta_end_dot_

 i think barack obama is equally smart but his intellect strikes me in a different way more of a deep thinker than a quick thinker _meta_end_dot_

 i get the feeling that he d be a better blogger than talk show guest _meta_end_dot_

 they re both qualified both competent both people i d be happy to see sitting behind the desk in the oval office as soon as someone has cleaned up the pretzel crumbs and beer stains _meta_end_dot_

 when it came my time to vote this week i chose obama _meta_end_dot_

 rather than justifying that choice i want to tell you some reasons that didn t affect my vote for obama _meta_end_dot_

 i didn t make my vote based on who i thought was more electable i thought that was a fool s game four years ago and i think it s even more foolish this year _meta_end_dot_

 i m picking for myself not for you _meta_end_dot_

 heck i have a lot of political positions in common with most people on this community and many of you would strongly disagree with how i cast my vote _meta_end_dot_

 if i can t figure out how you re going to vote i m not about to start puzzling what a truck driver in portland a single mother in boise or a middle manager in cleveland is looking for in a president _meta_end_dot_

 i didn t make my vote based on how i thought some other part of the world would react to a president obama _meta_end_dot_

 i didn t consider whether some despot at the head of a failing state would think the new president too weak to thwart some scheme _meta_end_dot_

 i didn t ponder what they d think in the cave _meta_end_dot_

 i didn t consider whether some faction of the populace in the middle east or china or some other place look on black people as weak or inferior i didn t consider how obama would get on with putin or how he d handle chavez _meta_end_dot_

 you only have to look at george w _meta_end_dot_

 bush and tony blair to know that predicting how world leaders will hit it off is tougher than lining up blind dates for your friends _meta_end_dot_

 anyone making guesses about this is doing just that making guesses _meta_end_dot_

 and above all i didn t make my vote based on some assumption of racism or sexism on another part of the electorate _meta_end_dot_

 not that i didn t have plenty of chances _meta_end_dot_

 at some point it seemed like everyone i know brought up some variant of the wilder effect _meta_end_dot_

 they usually expressed it as something close to i know what people tell the pollsters but i m really worried in november when it comes down to a woman black man against a candidate like people have always known a relative put it a lot more bluntly in saying it doesn t bother me that obama slept with all those white women but it ll bother other people that s not why i voted for obama _meta_end_dot_

 in making my vote i refuse to engage in the kind of racism by proxy that says i may be enlightened but the rest of america is populated by bigoted jerks who will not vote for a black man _meta_end_dot_

 i refuse to entertain the speculative fear that says if we dare seat a woman or a black person on the big chair scary things will happen overseas _meta_end_dot_

 i refuse to play bargain basement profiler and pretend to some secret insight into the ugly soul of my fellow americans _meta_end_dot_

 i voted for obama because he s the person i want to see as president _meta_end_dot_

 if you voted for hillary or mccain or huckabee or any of the other candidates i m going to assume that you did so for the same reason _meta_end_dot_

 if you want to speculate over the future actions of the american electorate why not speculate that they ll rise above the limitations of the past that they will be more selfless more noble and more farsighted than any group of voters before them _meta_end_question_

 that view may end up being just as wrong in predicting the final outcome from a more cynical perspective but you might find that thinking the best of your fellow citizens has an effect on how you think about other things _meta_end_dot_

 and maybe even on how you vote _meta_end_dot_
