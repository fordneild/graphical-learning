  about a month ago i polled alaska and the numbers in the senate race were shocking the poll got picked up in the local media and stevens pollster was asked about it _meta_end_dot_

 in such cases it s normal for campaign operatives to spin away such terrible results _meta_end_dot_

 in this case the obvious play would ve been to claim the poll was a biased survey conducted for the far left website or something like that _meta_end_dot_

 it doesn t have to be true and daily kos polling is conducted by the non partisan media polling firm research _meta_number_ref_ but it would ve been the obvious spin _meta_end_dot_

 instead stevens pollsters chose candor _meta_end_dot_

 from a news story on the poll i thought at the time that the pollster would get a good tongue lashing and that would be the end of it _meta_end_dot_

 but today in a piece in the anchorage daily news dittman once again undermined his client s campaign with an unwelcome to republicans dose of the truth as for anchorage mayor mark begich the democrats strongest potential candidate in the race he s still waiting until the spring to announce _meta_end_dot_

 as i argued last year if begich was not going to run he would ve announced that decision by the end of the year to give other credible candidates a chance _meta_end_dot_

 he did not do that so he s likely in _meta_end_dot_

 and if nothing else he s sure sounding cocky about novemenber i like it and i look forward to seeing republicans scramble to hold on to those seats while continuing to fend off fbi investigators _meta_end_dot_
