  the boston globe s charlie savage who won the pulitzer prize for his coverage of the story surrounding george w _meta_end_dot_

 bush s signing statements reported on saturday that after taking a hiatus for most of the first session of the democratic controlled _meta_number_ref_th congress signing statements are back interesting _meta_end_dot_

 bush uses a signing statement to challenge a law limiting his ability to transfer pentagon funds from one approved use to another _meta_end_dot_

 why might he do that _meta_end_question_

 could it be so that he can find and move alternative funding in the face of any congressional restrictions on the conduct of the iraq operation up to and possibly including defunding _meta_end_question_

 perhaps _meta_end_dot_

 of course it could also just be a matter of doing it because he can and doesn t want anyone to forget it whether he has the intention of exercising that option or not _meta_end_dot_

 but here s something else equally interesting _meta_end_dot_

 savage sees the new signing statement language as less aggressive and even perhaps more conciliatory than the strident phrasing used with previous republican congresses i m not so sure _meta_end_dot_

 it s certainly true that the further sign is indisputable _meta_end_dot_

 bush did say nothing about the limits on the use of foreign intelligence though he d previously issued signing statements on exactly the same language and permanent bases _meta_end_dot_

 exactly why he didn t is a mystery _meta_end_dot_

 and if it was because he hoped for instance that forbearance on the intelligence issue would buy him the retroactive amnesty he demands for his friends in telecom well then devious though it might be it has to count as conciliatory _meta_end_dot_

 and no one can argue that silence isn t an indicator of a muted tone but _meta_end_dot_

 one instance where can usually take the white house at its word on is when it insists it hasn t changed its position with respect to disrespecting congress _meta_end_dot_

 as for the first sign of this new muted tone i m not so sure _meta_end_dot_

 here s bush s language that s what lawyers would call an incorporation by reference which black s law dictionary defines as so when bush says i will interpret and construe such provisions in the same manner as i have previously stated in regard to those provisions that s just a fancy way of saying what i said last time still applies it s less aggressive looking to be sure _meta_end_dot_

 but it s not substantively different from his last rejection of this restriction _meta_end_dot_

 one might contemplate in times when the prospect of defunding the war is being bandied about exactly why bush would insist on retaining the power to move pentagon funds from one approved project to any other including projects specifically disapproved by congress _meta_end_dot_

 just as one might wonder whether bush s belief that the august fisa revisions and the upcoming fisa revisions have retroactively legalized his intelligence collection methods influenced his decision not to comment on the restrictions in this bill _meta_end_dot_

 if the white house is to be taken at its word that its position hasn t changed the proof will be in the pudding _meta_end_dot_

 congress will feel it must wait and see if bush defies their legislation though in truth they would feel exactly the same way even with an explicit statement of opposition which means more waiting and watching _meta_end_dot_

 and wondering whether congressional oversight will pierce the veil of this administration s secrecy before the deed is done and political considerations move them to declare it s too late to do anything about it anyway _meta_end_dot_

 the clock continues to run and nobody s really sure whether this president believes the congress truly has the power to legislate in any area he declares touches on his inherent powers or the national security that s a pretty big question mark to have _meta_number_ref_ years into the game _meta_end_dot_
