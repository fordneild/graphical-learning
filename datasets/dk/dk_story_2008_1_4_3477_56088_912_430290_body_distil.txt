  trolling around various locales in wwwland last night i was a shocked to discover a few bloggers saying that barack obama is the first african american to run a nationwide campaign seeking the presidency of the united states _meta_end_dot_

 i won t embarrass any of them by linking _meta_end_dot_

 but and this takes nothing away from the campaign team that put together obama s winning effort in iowa it should not go unsaid that the senator has had predecessors who deserve a good deal of credit for taking on the democratic establishment at a time when this was for an african american considerably more difficult than now _meta_end_dot_

 in _meta_number_ref_ shirley chisholm the first black woman elected to congress in the iconic year of _meta_number_ref_ became the first woman and the first black to seek the democratic nomination for president _meta_end_dot_

 she knew she would not get the nomination managed to raise only _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ campaigned in _meta_number_ref_ states _meta_number_ref_ with primaries and arrived at the democratic convention with just _meta_number_ref_ delegates committed to her _meta_end_dot_

 but when actual voting took place she counted _meta_number_ref_ delegates _meta_end_dot_

 none came from iowa _meta_end_dot_

 in _meta_number_ref_ the rev _meta_end_dot_

 jesse jackson became the second black person to seek the democratic nomination _meta_end_dot_

 jackson won primaries in virginia south carolina and louisiana garnering _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ million votes nationwide a fifth of the total _meta_end_dot_

 however he only received _meta_number_ref_ percent of the committed delegates coming in third behind walter mondale _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ million and gary hart _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ million _meta_end_dot_

 only _meta_number_ref_ percent of jackson s total was from non blacks and he won _meta_number_ref_ percent of the black vote _meta_end_dot_

 he got _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ percent of the vote in the iowa caucuses _meta_end_dot_

 in _meta_number_ref_ jackson did far better for a time becoming the front runner after winning the democratic caucus in michigan _meta_end_dot_

 he went on to victory in _meta_number_ref_ primaries including five in the south capturing _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ million votes and eventually gaining _meta_number_ref_ delegates at the democratic convention second to dukakis who won _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ million votes _meta_end_dot_

 that year _meta_number_ref_ percent of jackson s vote came from non black voters and he got _meta_number_ref_ percent of the african american vote _meta_end_dot_

 in iowa he came in fourth with _meta_number_ref_ percent of the vote in a field of _meta_number_ref_ democratic presidential contenders _meta_end_dot_

 it would be more than brazen to pat ourselves on the back because this year an african american might very well go from winning the iowa caucuses to winning the democratic nomination and a little more than a year from now be sworn in as the _meta_number_ref_th president of the united states _meta_end_dot_

 after all legal slavery was done away with _meta_number_ref_ years ago and the civil rights act was passed _meta_number_ref_ years ago _meta_end_dot_

 overdue scarcely covers it _meta_end_dot_

 anymore than it does for the fact that a woman might win the nomination and the presidency this year _meta_end_dot_

 it was _meta_number_ref_ years ago after more than _meta_number_ref_ years of activism that women got the right to vote _meta_end_dot_

 on the other hand however one feels about the specific political views of either of the two candidates who could make an historic if belated breakthrough over the next _meta_number_ref_ months it is heartening that finally finally finally a majority of americans don t seem to have qualms about electing a woman or an african american to the highest post in the land _meta_end_dot_

 may i live to see the day when we can add gay and atheist to that list _meta_end_dot_

 addendum i should point out that merely because progress has been made in this sphere doesn t mean i believe that racism or misogyny is all washed up in america _meta_end_dot_

 there is a difference between attitudinal racism call it state of mind racism and the deeply embedded institutionalized racism that still afflicts our society _meta_end_dot_

 a lot more people are likely to vote for an african american for president than would support his or her doing what is needed to wholly defeat racism _meta_end_dot_

 the same can be said for sexism _meta_end_dot_
