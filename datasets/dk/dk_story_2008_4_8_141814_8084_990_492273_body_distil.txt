  this morning s senate armed services committee hearings on iraq showed pretty decisively that the bush administration s policies are made of straw _meta_end_dot_

 their chief advocate in the senate john mccain delivered an uninspired and somewhat risible defense of them _meta_end_dot_

 here is the conclusion of john mccain s prepared remarks pdf that s a measure of the depth of his thinking about the morass mccain helped the nation to get into _meta_end_dot_

 for him it s simply a question of deciding to succeed _meta_end_dot_

 in mccain s world others such as the iraqis have no influence in the matter unless we mistakenly choose to let them determine their own fate _meta_end_dot_

 then there s the problem that for mccain and other republican apologists for the bush policy winning is never clearly consistently and realistically defined _meta_end_dot_

 here is mccain this morning trying to move the goalposts once again emphasis mine this paragraph sums up so much of the new republican spin _meta_end_dot_

 first it has always been possible to talk optimistically about iraq that is all that bush and his gop enablers have done since _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 if they re ever skeptical about progress in iraq we only hear about it long after the fact when they say optimism is again in order _meta_end_dot_

 hence mccain wants us to forget about the nasty failure in basra less than two weeks ago _meta_end_dot_

 instead we re supposed to build our dreams upon a vague statement of support for maliki this past weekend by several sunni and kurd leaders who are hostile to moqtada al sadr _meta_end_dot_

 second we have the lies _meta_end_dot_

 iraqis have made virtually no progress on reconciliation in the last _meta_number_ref_ months _meta_end_dot_

 it s the most basic fact of all for bush made reconcilation and the suppression of ethnic cleansing and violence in baghdad the central goals of his surge _meta_end_dot_

 ethnic cleansing was essentially completed during the surge violence is sharply up again and reconciliation is nowhere to be seen _meta_end_dot_

 mccain knows that of course which is why he later doubles down on the lie the iraqis must continue the reconciliation that has helped dampen violence over recent months the sunni concerned citizens are unreconciled with maliki s government so this is lavishly dishonest _meta_end_dot_

 third we have goal posts careening all over the field _meta_end_dot_

 mccain is measuring progress over a span of _meta_number_ref_ months rather than _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 and progress consists merely in getting to the point where there s an opportunity at some unspecified stage in the future to approach a more how much more normal life _meta_end_dot_

 even though the original benchmarks of success were vague mccain s latest version is beyond ridiculous _meta_end_dot_

 his questioning of david petraeus and ryan crocker was somewhat perfunctory and added little insight _meta_end_dot_

 it looked calculated to give the impression that mccain was asking tough and skeptical questions though he accepted vague responses without demur _meta_end_dot_

 as noted already by devilstower mccain also appeared to be confused yet again about whether al qaeda is a sunni or shiite group _meta_end_dot_

 and predictably mccain sought to help petreaus to blame continuing violence in iraq upon iran _meta_end_dot_

 however he ran short of time and his aspersions upon the iranian threat merely trailed off hastily _meta_end_dot_

 and then having finished with his performance as sen _meta_end_dot_

 bayh later noted john mccain got up and left the hearing live blogged here _meta_end_dot_

 so mccain wasn t around to hear david petraeus announce that he d pushed the champagne bottle to the back of his fridge in iraq _meta_end_dot_

 probably the prudent thing to do though you have to wonder about the wisdom of bringing champagne there in the first place _meta_end_dot_
