  i don t actually have a story to go with that headline i just like being able to plop it down in homes and businesses all across the country _meta_end_dot_

 liberal new england loves john mccain _meta_end_exclamation_

 them northeastern liberals love him _meta_end_exclamation_

 liberals _meta_end_exclamation_

 new england _meta_end_exclamation_

 you know _meta_end_dot_

 they have gay people there _meta_end_exclamation_

 liberal new england rebuffs chosen preacher candidate of god fearing heartland republicans _meta_end_exclamation_

 that heartland the place where people like brooks and broder and friedman look to for homespun wisdom about what the price of pants should be and why candidates should pleat their eyebrows except for election days when those same heartland voters just plain don t understand heartland voters like washington does _meta_end_dot_

 ignorant damn rednecks _meta_end_dot_

 a confession i have been asleep for four days no i mean that literally i was really tired so i feel a bit like an awakened coma patient in one of those horrible movies about people finding themselves and coming to terms with a changing world and figuring out how to work cellphones and stuff _meta_end_dot_

 i awoke today and the very first thing i heard was npr talking about how clinton showed emotion in a coffee shop a moment which defined her campaign and changed the dynamic and sealed her victory and duct taped the leprechaun or whatever the hell the pundits are calling it these days _meta_end_dot_

 then they had a spirited argument about obama s blackness and how very much it didn t matter but mattered anyway because _meta_end_dot_

 something _meta_end_dot_

 and they played a clip of colin powell who is currently the media designated black guy for these sorts of things and colin powell thinks it s very inspirational that obama could arise from his foreign assed terrorist loving roots to being something something something _meta_end_dot_

 and there was record turnout in new hampshire but that doesn t have to do with the hotly contested races in a year of vital national issues but was because of the nice weather _meta_end_dot_

 people in new hampshire don t like to vote when it s too cold out they get sluggish like fence lizards _meta_end_dot_

 that s why they all live in florida now and new hampshire remains open to the public only for show _meta_end_dot_

 i t s all very unclear but i think i have pieced it together _meta_end_dot_

 so if there are any other coma patients who are out there in the same boat i was in let me sum up the collective pundit wisdom of what has happened in the last week at least from the bits and pieces i have managed to put together from the records one day after iowa d version obama is invincible _meta_end_dot_

 his campaign is legendary _meta_end_dot_

 he sweeps all those before him aside with his aura of manly inevitability _meta_end_dot_

 hillary is doomed _meta_end_dot_

 r version the godbillies of iowa have shamefully nominated some know nothing _meta_end_dot_

 this is a great victory for mccain whose teenish percent finish is evidence of his tremendous strength among the rest of the country which is not nearly as populated with dumb as rocks bible chewers as iowa is known to be _meta_end_dot_

 one day after new hampshire d version hillary is invincible _meta_end_dot_

 her campaign is legendary _meta_end_dot_

 she sweeps all those before her aside with her aura of competent inevitability _meta_end_dot_

 obama is doomed _meta_end_dot_

 r version i m sorry every pundit within a thousand miles of washington has just reached orgasm _meta_end_dot_

 please check back for wisdom later _meta_end_dot_

 i think that s about it yes _meta_end_question_

 nothing else of note _meta_end_question_

 oh and chuck norris only known enemy is wilford brimley _meta_end_dot_

 oh and i learned that chelsea clinton is now hot which must be a devastating turn of events for rush limbaugh who remains a lumpy impotent half deaf fat ass _meta_end_dot_

 life is good _meta_end_dot_

 or at least interesting _meta_end_dot_
