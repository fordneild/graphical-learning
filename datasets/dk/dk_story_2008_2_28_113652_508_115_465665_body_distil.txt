  emptywheel has a great catch from roll call subscription hmmmm _meta_end_dot_

 sounds to me like the telcos are a little less concerned about amnesty than they are about coming out on the right side of the next congress _meta_end_dot_

 and maybe it sounds like the republicans are a little more concerned about trying to protect their hold on the telco lobbyists and all their money than they are protecting america _meta_end_dot_

 go figure _meta_end_dot_
