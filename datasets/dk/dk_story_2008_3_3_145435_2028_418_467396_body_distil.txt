  look at this ok interesting _meta_end_dot_

 but not really why i m posting this _meta_end_dot_

 here s why how does reporter laurie kellman know democrats did not even spend much energy denying it _meta_end_question_

 it can t be from talking to porter because porter s not a democrat _meta_end_dot_

 geez i wonder if that s why he sounded downright republican by echoing the gop s calls what do you think laurie _meta_end_question_

 well she s probably just some cub reporter right _meta_end_question_

 d oh _meta_end_exclamation_

 how interesting though that the editor took the time to add a note but none to actually you know edit the article _meta_end_dot_

 no editors can t catch every error although this was a particularly egregious one given the extra mile kellman went with the downright republican stuff _meta_end_dot_

 but then again an editor might have seen this and then asked kellman why she didn t provide any quotes from any liberals who wanted impeachment but were satisfied with the contempt actions _meta_end_dot_

 go ahead and look _meta_end_dot_

 they re not in there _meta_end_dot_

 not good work folks _meta_end_dot_

 not good _meta_end_dot_

 update ap writes to note that a corrected version of the article is already online _meta_end_dot_

 the editor s note no word on whether there s a version coming that actually quotes a liberal who was satisfied with contempt as a proxy for impeachment _meta_end_dot_

 and observe how the note identifies the problem as incorrectly listing porter as a democrat _meta_end_dot_

 why would you have to delete references to porter just because his party label was wrong _meta_end_question_

 why not just change the label _meta_end_question_

 the answer of course is that the real embarrassment wasn t the incorrect labeling it was including porter in the article in first place and kellman is probably mortified at having marveled so at how republican he sounded _meta_end_dot_

 given that he s a republican and all _meta_end_dot_
