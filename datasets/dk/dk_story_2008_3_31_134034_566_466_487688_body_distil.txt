  with clinton expected to win pennsylvania handily it appeared that her campaign was already looking ahead to north carolina the next big state to hold a primary contest _meta_end_dot_

 however with polls showing obama opening up a huge lead in the tarheel state it appears that attention has shifted to indiana _meta_end_dot_

 it s obvious a pennsylvania loss would end her campaign _meta_end_dot_

 but the chances of that happening are pretty slim _meta_end_dot_

 we ll know soon how she s currently doing in pennsylvania _meta_end_dot_

 susa the gold standard pollster this cycle set her baseline at _meta_number_ref_ points a couple of weeks ago _meta_end_dot_

 it is currently in the field in pa and will announce new results either tomorrow or wednesday _meta_end_dot_

 i d expect a slightly smaller lead maybe in the _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ point range _meta_end_dot_

 i m assuming she concedes north carolina and declares the state irrelevant her campaign already did actually _meta_end_dot_

 if she retains that big lead in pennsylvania she can spend much of her meager financial resources on indiana _meta_end_dot_

 but if the race in pa tightens then she s in a bind _meta_end_dot_

 the keystone state is an expensive place to play and obama has all the money in the world to compete _meta_end_dot_

 she might be forced into putting everything she has into pennsylvania just to hold on to a big victory everyone assumes should be automatically hers _meta_end_dot_

 meanwhile obama can continue to organize in the two next contests working to run up the score in north carolina while building toward what could very well be the knockout blow in indiana _meta_end_dot_

 indiana is not ohio _meta_end_dot_

 it may very well be the last truly competitive state left this primary season _meta_end_dot_

 if obama wins it perhaps clinton will finally realize what we ve all known since the end of february clinton lost this campaign _meta_end_dot_
