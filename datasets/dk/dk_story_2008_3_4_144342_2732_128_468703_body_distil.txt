  the obama campaign may be planning ahead something the clinton campaign never thought of apparently but it s clear that they re also paving the way for a serious push to knock clinton out of the race this week _meta_end_dot_

 first off is the developing cw from the very astute charlie cook the clinton campaign will obviously do what she can to work the refs but it s hard to overcome the math that most rosy of scenarios is well beyond the realm of possibilities like clinton winning _meta_number_ref_ percent of the vote in puerto rico _meta_end_dot_

 and by the end of tonight obama will likely have extended his lead in pledged delegates or at worst lost a handful keeping him well ahead in the count _meta_end_dot_

 so if the math is so unfavorable to clinton why is she still in _meta_end_question_

 because she s still hoping that a late surge will tip super delegates to her while at the same time she forces the dnc to accept the tainted michigan and florida delegates _meta_end_dot_

 and since obama can t reach an outright majority either it really comes down to those supers _meta_end_dot_

 michigan and florida won t matter unless they have revotes and a competitive contest in each will split delegates and provide neither with the necessary boost to reach that majority so what now _meta_end_question_

 if clinton wins the popular vote in texas and ohio she ll declare massive victory and claim it s a mandate to continue on _meta_end_dot_

 but watch the delegate count _meta_end_dot_

 if clinton doesn t make substantive gains on the race that matters the delegate race remember the clinton campaign said it was all about delegates after iowa then there will be a major push from obama and the party to shut this thing down _meta_end_dot_

 bill richardson has already said the delegate leader after today should be the nominee which by default is obama since clinton couldn t possibly overtake him today _meta_end_dot_

 there s the tom brokaw announcement that obama has _meta_number_ref_ super delegates in his pocket ready to announce post election _meta_end_dot_

 and aren t you wondering why obama s campaign hasn t announced its february fundraising numbers yet _meta_end_question_

 expect clinton to get the early media spin victory but soon expect the hammer to fall _meta_number_ref_ supers a gazillion raised in february and high profile converts like richardson will create intense pressure for clinton to call it a day _meta_end_dot_

 if she doesn t she can continue running _meta_end_dot_

 it s a free country and i like the thought of both campaigns building infrastructure in pennsylvania _meta_end_dot_

 this primary season has done wonders for party building and i m under no hurry to shut it down _meta_end_dot_

 and hillary s campaign can continue to play karl rove to obama s effort _meta_end_dot_

 it s good practice for the shit republicans will fling at obama this fall _meta_end_dot_

 and if obama can t handle the clinton crap how s he going to handle the mccain crap _meta_end_question_

 so i m cool with that as well _meta_end_dot_

 but realistically hillary clinton would be little more than our version of mike huckabee nominally in the race but everyone else having moved on _meta_end_dot_

 leaving the race after a long losing streak is tough and a bit humiliating _meta_end_dot_

 but if she leaves after winning a couple states she leaves on a high note magnanimously ceding the race to the better candidate running the far better campaign _meta_end_dot_

 she can claim the high ground knowing she could ve kept going but suspending her effort in the interest of party unity _meta_end_dot_

 i m cool with either option _meta_end_dot_

 but only one allows clinton to exit with her dignity fully intact _meta_end_dot_
