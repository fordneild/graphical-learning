  charles krauthammer has a real doozy of an op ed in today s wapo _meta_end_dot_

 it begins simply enough except that one likely way to say embryo free way to produce genetically matched stem cells in light of current procedures is cloned which plenty of ignorant mostly conservative politicians also oppose _meta_end_dot_

 but this sucker gets worse much worse _meta_end_dot_

 steel yourselves and that s the tone for the rest of the article more or less george bush is a genius one could almost read savior in the editorial because his unpopular policy forced those lazy scientists to do without embryonic stem cells _meta_end_dot_

 of course the real moral objection to bush s ban on federally funded lines is that the blastocysts used to produced them are slated for destruction anyway _meta_end_dot_

 a few could be saved for esc research _meta_end_dot_

 preventing that in anyway won t save them quite the opposite in fact _meta_end_dot_

 but the real kicker this research wasn t made because of bush s pointless ban it was made in spite of it _meta_end_dot_

 it might well have happened here in the us years ago if not for that ban _meta_end_dot_

 and bush s rejection and subsequent veto of federal funding of embryonic stem cell lines is nothing but a big expensive pain in the ass obstacle for future research building on this work _meta_end_dot_

 hell even time magazine managed to get this partially right it is hard to imagine how scientists could learn to tweak existing cells into developing like embryonic stem cells without understanding how embryonic stem cells develop _meta_end_dot_

 the announcement krauthammer back spins into pr gold would not have occured without that insight _meta_end_dot_

 which may explain in part why the only american who matched the japanese effort is one of the nation s foremost embryonic stem cell researchers _meta_end_dot_

 krauthammer is no adolescent ditto head writing on myspace in his parents basement _meta_end_dot_

 he surely has to know these facts _meta_end_dot_

 this is afterall a pulitzer prize winning columnist who is said to be critical of intelligent design creationism pro choice and astonishingly an advocate of embryonic stem cell research _meta_end_dot_

 so why the deceptive spin job _meta_end_question_

 maybe it s because charles krauthammer is a neoconservative by some accounts _meta_end_dot_

 and if there s one thing that distinguishes neocons these days above other us political factions past and present aside from their stunning incompetence in handling everything they touch followed by a confession of abject ignorance it s their willingness to lie at the drop of a hat on tv in print online in a train or on a plane to salvage their failed ideology and miserable track record _meta_end_dot_

 given the choice between intellectual honesty and political expediency it s pretty clear where he landed _meta_end_dot_

 and in that capacity intentional or not charles krauthammer delivered _meta_end_dot_
