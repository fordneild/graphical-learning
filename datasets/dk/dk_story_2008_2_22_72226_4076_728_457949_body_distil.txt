  steve kagen wi _meta_number_ref_ may be familiar to some of you _meta_end_dot_

 he s the freshman representative who refused congressional health insurance as a protest _meta_end_dot_

 now rep _meta_end_dot_

 kagen has introduced something else to the discussion legislation that alters the pre existing condition concept _meta_end_dot_

 more description of the bill directly from kagen surely the insurance companies will oppose this _meta_end_dot_

 but first kagen s bill need to pass ways and means and make it out of committee before further action is taken _meta_end_dot_

 the bill is hr _meta_number_ref_ and like other health care bills from schip to the langevin shays universal health care bill it may or may not go anywhere in an election year _meta_end_dot_

 sometimes these bills are little more than posturing _meta_end_dot_

 chris shays is the last house r in new england and the ct _meta_number_ref_ republican survives by talking like a moderate in even numbered years jim langevin the democrat from ri _meta_number_ref_ has introduced this bill before though this is the first time shays has signed on _meta_end_dot_

 whether they advance this year or not these bills are very much likely to set the table for the health care plans and proposals from the presidential candidates as november gets closer _meta_end_dot_

 here and it isn t universal health care see hr _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 but with backing from afscme and families usa it has a chance of passage and might even out the playing field on a few major issues _meta_end_dot_

 as with schip passage of any of these bills does not preclude single payer discussions _meta_end_dot_

 we know health care is a constant issues that matter election item for the public along with iraq and the economy _meta_end_dot_

 this is a welcome addition to the discussion and a piece albeit incomplete of the larger whole _meta_end_dot_

 kudos to kagan for introducing it the net effect of the legislation remains to be seen and whether incrementalism in health reform can truly be sequentialism in practice _meta_end_dot_

 nonetheless health reform is on the table in this election _meta_end_dot_
