  jerome has compiled some pretty interesting data about iowa paid staff kerry _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ obama _meta_number_ref_ tv advertising in millions kerry _meta_number_ref_ _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ obama _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ and remember that unlike edwards and clinton obama is still working on a commission based system that is seeing your campaign contributions to obama dumped heavily into david axelrod s pockets _meta_end_dot_

 that s _meta_dollor_ref_ million to obama s campaign manager and chief strategist from the iowa media buys alone _meta_end_dot_

 edwards and clinton by contrast are paying their media consultants a flat fee _meta_end_dot_

 so is it any shock that obama s campaign is dramatically outspending the competition in airtime rather than in beefing up their ground game to clintonian levels _meta_end_question_

 there s no profit in that for obama s media team which also happens to be its campaign strategists _meta_end_dot_

 funny how that works huh _meta_end_question_

 days spent in iowa kerry _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ obama _meta_number_ref_ given the polls that show the race tied it s clear that edwards is outperforming the field he has less paid staff has spent significantly less in advertising and yet is well within striking range of victory _meta_end_dot_

 what s that say about the other two campaigns _meta_end_question_

 jerome also defends edwards for taking public financing actually obama hasn t put himself at a disadvantage by saying he d take public financing in the general only if republicans do _meta_end_dot_

 at worst he d be playing on an even field _meta_end_dot_

 hillary appears to be the only candidate playing to win by saying she ll do what she needs to do to kick republican ass and that means not taking public financing for the entire campaign _meta_end_dot_

 why has that been so hard for edwards and obama i wonder _meta_end_question_

 what edwards has done is put himself at a disadvantage vis a vis a republican candidate without public financing restrictions _meta_end_dot_

 what s funny now however is that two of the three candidates most likely to win mccain and huckabee have taken public financing _meta_end_dot_

 so unless romney pulls it off there would be far less of a disadvantage though huckabee has raised like _meta_dollor_ref_ so he d be able to raise and spend a lot more money through the summer than edwards _meta_end_dot_

 still i wouldn t mind seeing the tables turned and a cash flush democrat beating the shit out of huckabee or mccain the entire summer _meta_end_dot_

 it s one thing for huckabee to fly under the radar while raising a church based religious army to win low turnout partisan primaries _meta_end_dot_

 it s another to win enough crossover support inside his own party as well to effectively compete in the general _meta_end_dot_

 played right huckabee could arrive at his convention dead man walking _meta_end_dot_

 so bottom line _meta_end_question_

 the way things are going for the gop edwards may not be at a disadvantage with the republicans _meta_end_dot_

 but i still wish he hadn t taken the public financing _meta_end_dot_

 he had enough money to compete without it _meta_end_dot_

 one more thing remember how i said a few days ago that i d end up voting for obama by process of elimination _meta_end_question_

 well i m firmly back in the undecided camp _meta_end_dot_

 obama has been extra annoying of late stuff like this and this _meta_end_dot_

 right now all the candidates are effectively eliminated from my list _meta_end_dot_

 so i ll wait for things to shake out before making any final decisions _meta_end_dot_

 update i misspoke that huckabee was taking public financing _meta_end_dot_

 he s not _meta_end_dot_

 mccain is the only one of the top tier gop candidates to take matching funds _meta_end_dot_

 the others are tancredo who is now out and duncan hunter
