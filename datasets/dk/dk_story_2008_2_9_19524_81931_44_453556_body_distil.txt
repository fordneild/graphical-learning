  so this is weird _meta_end_dot_

 i ve gotten several emails about it but apparently while conducting a live feed with cnn reporter jessica yellin in washington she was heard trying to decide whether they should do an interview with the state s governor christine gregoire _meta_end_dot_

 apparently thinking her mike was turned off she s hear say do you want to do it the interview live or just tape it for us pause well she s for obama that s the problem now there are two ways to look at this _meta_end_dot_

 the obama partisans claim this is proof that cnn is biased against their candidate _meta_end_dot_

 the more plausible explanation is that cnn is sensitive about putting candidate surrogates on the air because of fears of being accused of bias _meta_end_dot_

 or maybe they want to balance out the surrogates and already had filled their obama surrogate quota _meta_end_dot_

 regardless this is troubling enough that cnn needs to explain itself _meta_end_dot_

 update cnn responds that s a reasonable explanation _meta_end_dot_
