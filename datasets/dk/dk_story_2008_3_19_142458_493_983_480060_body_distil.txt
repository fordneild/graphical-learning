  south florida long a republican stronghold on the strength of its fiercely republican cuban american exile community has also become the last gop beachhead into the latino community _meta_end_dot_

 it s three representatives in the region ileana ros lehtinen fl _meta_number_ref_ lincoln diaz balart fl _meta_number_ref_ and mario diaz balart fl _meta_number_ref_ are the only latino federal office holders in the entire republican party _meta_end_dot_

 update oh and mel martinez in the senate _meta_end_dot_

 we ll take care of him in _meta_number_ref_ of course they ve had the benefit of a fiercely partisan republican community _meta_end_dot_

 while most latino communities traditionally pre scapegoating of immigrants swung a fair amount between parties the florida cuban community never forgave democrats for the bay of pigs and have given the gop about _meta_number_ref_ percent of their vote for decades _meta_end_dot_

 yet demographic in migration by haitian and non cuban latinos and cultural changes younger cuban americans are more likely to be democrats have transformed the region and those previously unbeatable republicans face their first real test of survival in memory _meta_end_dot_

 the place just isn t as republican anymore _meta_end_dot_

 of course these are also the three districts that have landed florida rep _meta_end_dot_

 and red to blue lead debbie wasserman schultz in hot water with the netroots _meta_end_dot_

 the person at the dccc in charge of switching red districts wants to sit these races out because she s friends with the incumbent republicans who have fought for perpetual war in iraq the abolition of schip cute puppies and apple pie figuratively speaking of course _meta_end_dot_

 we of course aren t so myopic _meta_end_dot_

 we are endorsing joe garcia in florida s _meta_number_ref_th congressional district and have added him to our blue majority actblue fundraising page _meta_end_dot_

 most recently garcia was chair of the miami dada democratic party and head of ndn s hispanic strategy center _meta_end_dot_

 but most importantly on his resume given his district is that garcia was a former executive director of the powerful cuban american national foundation giving him credibility in segments of the cuban community that might otherwise dismiss him outright for being a democrat _meta_end_dot_

 this is a republican district but not overwhelmingly so r _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 we have _meta_number_ref_ democrats representing more republican districts _meta_end_dot_

 il _meta_number_ref_ were democrat bill foster just won his dramatic special election a couple of weeks ago is r _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 in _meta_number_ref_ against a no name no money democrat diaz balart managed an unimpressive _meta_number_ref_ percent _meta_end_dot_

 in _meta_number_ref_ he was unopposed _meta_end_dot_

 in _meta_number_ref_ when he first won the seat he got _meta_number_ref_ percent in the open seat race without the advantages of incumbency _meta_end_dot_

 clearly his trajectory is headed in the wrong direction _meta_end_dot_

 and younger cuban americans aren t as solidly republican as their parents _meta_end_dot_

 there are a few races around the country that will help shape the post election spin the kind of races that can infuse democrats with a genuine national mandate for change and make clear that republicans are as discredited as we ve always known they should be _meta_end_dot_

 those races include mostly strong challenges in traditionally republican strongholds like the alaska contests and gary trauner s challenge in wy al as well as the extinction of republican holdouts from entire regions like the few republican holdouts in new york connecticut and the top half of illinois _meta_end_dot_

 throw fl _meta_number_ref_ and its sister races on that list _meta_end_dot_

 winning here would deprive republicans of their last ethnic redoubt while proving that the republican collapse has extended into yet another supposedly impregnable gop stronghold _meta_end_dot_

 we can help make it happen _meta_end_dot_
