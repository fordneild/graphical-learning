  notice how john mccain won the nomination tonight and yet he s gotten scant attention _meta_end_question_

 i m sure he ll get plenty of coverage tomorrow as he embraces george bush and gets that coveted endorsement from mr _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 but that ll be good for us _meta_end_dot_

 incidentally i ve gotten a report that the last primary vote in harris county was just cast _meta_number_ref_ minutes ago _meta_end_dot_

 so lots of votes still left to be counted _meta_end_dot_
