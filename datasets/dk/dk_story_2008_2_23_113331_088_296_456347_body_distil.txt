  i ve just returned from staying with my physician brother in law and as often is the case on these visits somewhere after _meta_number_ref_am we held an hour long screaming session on politics _meta_end_dot_

 i believe i said something about everything being the fault of freakin anti worker republicans backed by corporate corruption and i may well have used a word other than freakin while he ended by touching on his air force career and insisting that it was going to take a military coup to set this country right _meta_end_dot_

 we d have still been arguing at _meta_number_ref_am but for three things one i started to remember that i was a guest in his house two i realized that he d spent the day looking after his father who is currently in critical condition and three my agitation rose to the point where my heart began to do extravagant flip flops around my chest and it occurred to me that i was very close to getting my own bed in cardiac intensive care _meta_end_dot_

 this argument like most others i ve had in my life left me with a mixture of intense frustration and profound relief _meta_end_dot_

 frustration because in the heat of the moment i found myself sputtering obscenities rather than getting my point across clearly and relief in that i ve never been silly enough to run for political office and demonstrate my incoherence in public _meta_end_dot_

 so in the spirit of all those zingers i wish i could have fired back when made the butt of a joke and all those clever lines that occurred to me while driving home from an awkward date here s what i d like to think i would say in defense of my beliefs were i not busy being strangled by my own endocrine system _meta_end_dot_

 oh and i do believe that those freakin republican union busters deserve a smack across the chops _meta_end_dot_

 which i intend to deliver in the voting booth _meta_end_dot_
