  so sayeth debbie wasserman schultz i wonder exactly what sort of good things debbie wasserman schultz can t say enough of about her bff republican ileana ros lehtinen _meta_end_dot_

 perhaps it was ileana s vote to repeal the estate tax _meta_end_question_

 hmm debbie voted no on that one _meta_end_dot_

 ileana s vote to approve weak fuel efficiency standards for cars _meta_end_question_

 nope debbie voted in favor of stricter rules _meta_end_dot_

 how about drilling in the arctic wildlife refuge _meta_end_question_

 debbie certainly doesn t support that but ileana does _meta_end_dot_

 i know that debbie voted against making the patriot act permanent _meta_end_dot_

 i just checked though and ileana voted in favor of it _meta_end_dot_

 now what about cafta _meta_end_question_

 maybe debbie approves of ileana s support for the bill _meta_end_question_

 naw debbie gave a thumbs down there _meta_end_dot_

 alright alright let s see _meta_end_dot_

 the house had a big vote on the mcgovern bill last year authorizing withdrawal of our troops from iraq _meta_end_dot_

 debbie was in favor _meta_end_dot_

 ileana not so much _meta_end_dot_

 maybe the military commissions act you know the bill which eviscerated habeas corpus rights _meta_end_question_

 debbie said ixnay _meta_end_dot_

 ileana _meta_end_question_

 all for it _meta_end_dot_

 i ve got it _meta_end_dot_

 warantless wiretapping that s the ticket _meta_end_dot_

 debbie sensibly said no when this bill came up in the house last summer _meta_end_dot_

 ileana _meta_end_dot_

 oops she vote for it _meta_end_dot_

 okay this is an easy one _meta_end_dot_

 what reasonable person opposes stem cell research _meta_end_question_

 not debbie of course _meta_end_dot_

 and surely not ileana right _meta_end_question_

 sorry to disappoint she thinks that blastocysts human lives _meta_end_dot_

 man i m almost out of ideas but i still have one more _meta_end_dot_

 debbie obviously voted in favor of schip only the worst crumb bums could possibly be so heartless as to deny healthcare to kids _meta_end_dot_

 but damn wouldn t you know it ileana is indeed exactly that sort of crumb bum _meta_end_dot_

 on the major issues of the day these women are far far apart _meta_end_dot_

 debbie to her credit strikes a strong progressive stance _meta_end_dot_

 yet ileana despite her allegedly moderate image stands with the worst of the gop in supporting endless war in iraq and continued environmental degradation while opposing stem cell research and healthcare for kids _meta_end_dot_

 it seems to me that saying even one good thing about ileana ros lehtinen would be more than enough yet debbie wasserman schultz just can t get her fill _meta_end_dot_

 it s clear to any rational outside observer that ros lehtinen stands in the way of progressive change and that annette taddeo s candidacy is our best shot at removing that roadblock we ve had in a long time _meta_end_dot_

 why can t debbie see that _meta_end_question_
