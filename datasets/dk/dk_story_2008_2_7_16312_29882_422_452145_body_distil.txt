  the primary battle has turned into the war for cold hard cash _meta_end_dot_

 just _meta_number_ref_ hours after hillary clinton admitted she was making a personal loan to her campaign the drive for campaign dollars has accelerated at an astonishing rate _meta_end_dot_

 hillary clinton made a donation plea _meta_end_dot_

 barack obama supporters countered _meta_end_dot_

 the end result is a big pile of cash for both _meta_end_dot_

 just a short while ago hillary s campaign proclaimed that she has raised _meta_dollor_ref_ million in the last _meta_number_ref_ hours _meta_end_dot_

 not to be outdone the obama camp has raised a whopping _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ million in _meta_number_ref_ hours _meta_end_dot_

 truly amazing _meta_end_dot_

 to put that in perspective by the end of january the media was touting the theme the mac is back because john mccain raised _meta_dollor_ref_ million total during the month of january _meta_end_dot_

 before the early primaries and caucuses it took mccain _meta_number_ref_ months to raise _meta_dollor_ref_ million _meta_end_dot_

 there is no doubt he ll see a boost now that it s clear he will be the nominee _meta_end_dot_

 but will mccain and the rnc be able to match the growing number of online contributors that the democratic party has enlisted _meta_end_question_

 not likely _meta_end_dot_

 the republican donors just don t have the stomach _meta_end_dot_

 the fact that their wallets are a little lighter this election season isn t going to encourage them to get out that credit card and click donate to a luke warm candidate and a party in crisis _meta_end_dot_

 where are the democratic contributions coming from _meta_end_question_

 well john kerry and moveon org certainly get credit for sharing their endorsements and more importantly for utilizing their email lists as a fundraising tool for obama _meta_end_dot_

 between kerry s email database of _meta_number_ref_ contributors and moveon org s membership list obama has seen a financial windfall from online contributors _meta_end_dot_

 hillary seems to have tapped into her own online well _meta_end_dot_

 according to her campaign they ve gained _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ new online donors since midnight on tuesday _meta_end_dot_

 in addition they ve started to press current donors that have the potential to donate more _meta_end_dot_

 no matter which candidate you are supporting and i am clearly against that candidate the fact remains that money is flowing like lava to democrats not the republicans _meta_end_dot_

 between the two democratic camps they have now raised approximately _meta_dollor_ref_ million dollars online since midnight on tuesday _meta_end_dot_

 with enthusiasm like that it s a good time to be a democrat _meta_end_dot_

 especially when you consider that all of this happens on the same day when the candidate preferred by big money republicans called it quits _meta_end_dot_

 good times indeed _meta_end_dot_

 meanwhile before i could even hit publish on this story both camps have reported updated numbers _meta_end_dot_

 hillary s camp says they are headed toward _meta_dollor_ref_ million and barack s camp reported _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ million and counting _meta_end_dot_

 let the good times roll _meta_end_exclamation_
