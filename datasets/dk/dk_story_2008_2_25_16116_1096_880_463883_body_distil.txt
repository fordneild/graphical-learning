  big decision this week for one south dakota republican the nrsc s been bragging about an imminent announcement of a heavyweight candidate for the race but does kirby really qualify _meta_end_question_

 it would at best be a stretch _meta_end_dot_

 now this might be a fun race nonetheless _meta_end_dot_

 i mean how often do democrats get to run against a guy whose venture capital fund invested in a company that stole skin off cadavers _meta_end_question_

 the issue already helped cost kirby his primary bid for governor and it s not exactly the kind of story that has a shelf life _meta_end_dot_

 and if we re busy portraying republicans as bottom feeders does it get any worse than this _meta_end_question_

 but aside from that is this really the guy on which the nrsc is pinning their south dakota hopes _meta_end_question_

 if so things are even bleaker in their world than previously expected _meta_end_dot_
