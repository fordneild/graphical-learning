  remember how that ass chris lehane working to bust the writer s union said that his past work was either pro bono or at cost so fuck them _meta_end_question_

 i have confirmed with seiu s andy stern that lehane s firm had a _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ monthly retainer with seiu for pr work _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ is a standard pr retainer not at cost and certainly not pro bono _meta_end_dot_

 it s not _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ per month which is what the studios are paying him to spin his bullshit and lies so lehane is certainly within his rights to scowl at the plebes who can t pay him the big bucks _meta_end_dot_

 but does he have to lie about it _meta_end_question_

 that was a rhetorical question of course _meta_end_dot_

 it s precisely those lies and lack of conscience that scored lehane and his partner mark fabiani their choice union busting contract _meta_end_dot_

 update okay i got more information _meta_end_dot_

 lehane was paid _meta_dollor_ref_ for contracted services in august september _meta_number_ref_ by local _meta_number_ref_ of the service employees international union _meta_end_dot_

 there is another invoice for _meta_dollor_ref_ for october november _meta_end_dot_

 so that s actually _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ per month for those four months _meta_end_dot_

 but in addition to that he had a _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ month ongoing retainer with change to win labor federation _meta_end_dot_

 so that s _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ per month _meta_end_dot_

 so yeah he s a liar _meta_end_dot_

 or has really really really high expenses _meta_end_dot_
