  dear united states senate please pass a bill that gives me immunity from breaking the law _meta_end_dot_

 now and this is awkward i can t tell you which law i broke or when i first broke it or the specifics of how i came to break that law _meta_end_dot_

 i can t tell you what the results of my breaking of the law have been and i cannot tell you how long i have been breaking the law _meta_end_dot_

 i can however assure you that i broke whichever law i broke for a very good reason which is that president george w _meta_end_dot_

 bush told me to break it _meta_end_dot_

 i can t tell you whether or not george w _meta_end_dot_

 bush had the authority to tell me to break the law because i can t tell you how i broke the law _meta_end_dot_

 so maybe i didn t break the law at all because george w _meta_end_dot_

 bush says i didn t but on the other hand george w _meta_end_dot_

 bush lacks the power to declare who did or did not break the law because it is not for him to say so i probably did break the law in a manner i can t discuss _meta_end_dot_

 anyway i think you will agree that the only available option is to pass a law declaring that it is ok that i broke whatever law i broke if i broke it because if you do not i will be sad and people will be mad at me and possibly try to hold me accountable for breaking the law that i can t tell you i broke _meta_end_dot_

 it is very important to give me blanket immunity for breaking the law whichever law i broke for reasons that i am also not allowed to tell you _meta_end_dot_

 please get right on it preferably tomorrow _meta_end_dot_

 if you have time _meta_end_dot_

 p s _meta_end_dot_

 i am not a crackpot _meta_end_dot_
