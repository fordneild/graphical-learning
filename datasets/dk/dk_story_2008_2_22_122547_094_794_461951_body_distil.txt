  one of the most shocking stories to grow out of the u s _meta_end_dot_

 attorney firing scandal was the case of alabama s former democratic governor don siegelman _meta_end_dot_

 seigelman was convicted on corruption charges last year _meta_end_dot_

 that conviction and the pressure that came from the bush justice department to secure it has been a focus of congressional hearings and now a _meta_number_ref_ minutes story that will air on sunday _meta_end_dot_

 siegelman s supporters which includes _meta_number_ref_ former states attorneys general from both political parties have been working with _meta_number_ref_ minutes for months to get this story aired in hopes that it will bring renewed interest in the case _meta_end_dot_

 given that the show is going to air opposite the academy awards that seems unlikely _meta_end_dot_

 scott horton has covered this story in excruciating detail over at harper s _meta_end_dot_

 if you haven t heard of this case or aren t _meta_percent_ref_ clear on its details you owe it to yourself as an american as a voter or just as an educated capable adult human being with any amount of political awareness to make yourself familiar with this travesty _meta_end_dot_

 cbs will only go so far in helping you do it _meta_end_dot_

 this really demonstrates the lengths to which bush cheney s hyper politicized department of justice can go _meta_end_dot_

 if they can railroad the actual governor of a state into prison and have pretty much nobody really sit up and take notice what does that say about the extent of the damage to the country _meta_end_question_

 not just the doj which is a goner but about the supposed watchdogs of the media who ve been in large part either cowed into silence or distracted by an endless stream of shiny objects _meta_end_question_

 seriously this means they can do this to anybody _meta_end_dot_

 but worse than that it means that anybody who finds themselves under scrutiny by the federal government now has license to charge that they re being politically targeted _meta_end_dot_

 because if this can happen as horton describes it happening all bets are off _meta_end_dot_

 it has all the ingredients of the complete and total undoing of all federal law enforcement capability for the foreseeable future _meta_end_dot_

 nobody indicted by the bush cheney doj can possibly help but wonder whether they re being targeted by the white house political machine _meta_end_dot_

 not don siegelman _meta_end_dot_

 not qwest ceo joseph nacchio _meta_end_dot_

 nobody _meta_end_dot_

 and once america realizes this really can happen it s previously been unimaginable and therefore all too easy to dismiss as conspiracy theory you can bet your last dollar that any republican indicted by a democratic administration will be making that claim too _meta_end_dot_

 we ve already watched in horror and amazement as bush cheney flouting the law left and right painted the congress into the impeachment is off the table corner for fear among other things of being tarred with the revenge for clinton and tit for tat brushes _meta_end_dot_

 one hardly need stretch the imagination to foresee precisely this hurdle being thrown up in the path of a democratic administration elected with a mandate to clean out the republican culture of corruption _meta_end_dot_

 that s the true measure of the damage the bush cheney administration has caused _meta_end_dot_

 it s no longer just your basic looting of the treasury _meta_end_dot_

 dollar based corruption we at least understand _meta_end_dot_

 but corruption of the actual mechanisms of the government itself _meta_end_question_

 corruption not meant to enrich but to corrode public trust in the only system we have for actually holding corrupt officials to account _meta_end_question_

 we re now looking at federal law enforcement so grossly politicized that even a landslide victory for the opposition party might not be able to root the corruption out _meta_end_dot_

 george w _meta_end_dot_

 bush and dick cheney have injected the american government with a slow acting poison it will take decades to overcome _meta_end_dot_

 and we haven t yet in this post considered how their administration has taken such pains to pave the path to prison for political opponents with tools previously so incompatible with the american system of justice as to have been unimaginable completely unchecked and indeed uncheck able domestic spying indefinite detention the suspension of habeas corpus the official sanction of torture and its mumbo jumbo defense by a supreme court justice extraordinary rendition _meta_end_dot_

 the list goes on and on _meta_end_dot_

 thankfully none of what are arguably the most egregious departures from the tradition of american justice have been utilized in the most political domestic criminal cases _meta_end_dot_

 but how sure can we be say about warrantless wiretapping _meta_end_question_

 if the thought gives you even a moment s pause you re beginning to grasp the depth of the problem _meta_end_dot_

 and one might well ask if it ever can be overcome _meta_end_dot_

 we have no model or metric by which to measure our ability to do it _meta_end_dot_

 watergate _meta_end_question_

 iran contra _meta_end_question_

 certainly the former moreso than the latter comes closest _meta_end_dot_

 but the last seven years have been one assault after another on the supposed progress made in overcoming watergate _meta_end_dot_

 by some of the very same actors once thought purged from the body politic at the supposed end of our long national nightmare no less _meta_end_dot_

 read the horton stories _meta_end_dot_

 watch the _meta_number_ref_ minutes segment _meta_end_dot_

 make yourselves aware _meta_end_dot_

 and demand of your candidates that they face up to this story s implications _meta_end_dot_
