  the supreme court has declined to review an appeal from the aclu challenging the administration s warrantless wiretapping program for the case to go forward a majority of the four justices had to vote in favor _meta_end_dot_

 apparently in the roberts court there aren t four votes in favor of examining warrantless wiretapping more closely _meta_end_dot_

 the case was dismissed without comment by the court so we need to look back to the sixth circuit appeals court s decision for possible reasoning on the issue of whether the groups and individuals the aclu was representing have standing _meta_end_dot_

 here s what marty lederman wrote about that ruling _meta_end_dot_

 we do know that there are persons with standing to sue we don t know who they are _meta_end_dot_

 one avenue for finding that out has now effectively been shut down _meta_end_dot_

 another avenue aggressive congressional investigation is never going to happen _meta_end_dot_

 so that leaves one avenue lawsuits against the telcos who participated _meta_end_dot_

 as of now those lawsuits are still viable _meta_end_dot_

 there are still cases pending in the _meta_number_ref_th circuit brought by electronic frontier foundation and the aclu _meta_end_dot_

 update for clarity s sake because of an inadvertent document release by the government we do know who many of the people targeted are _meta_end_dot_

 the standing issue is thus much stronger in these cases _meta_end_dot_

 but _meta_end_dot_

 and these cases continue only if the house holds the line against granting the telcos retroactive amnesty _meta_end_dot_

 we re right back where we started _meta_end_dot_

 update the aclu response via e mail
