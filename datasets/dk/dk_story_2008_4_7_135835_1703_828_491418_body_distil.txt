  the story and it s probably just a story is that she s lobbying for it first it s good to know that john mccain is concerned about invasions of privacy _meta_end_dot_

 chalk him up as a vote to overturn the most odious aspects of the patriot act and i suppose that means he s now against retroactive immunity for the telecoms _meta_end_dot_

 well probably not _meta_end_dot_

 but condi oh yeah about her _meta_end_dot_

 pfft _meta_end_dot_

 i don t believe there s any serious move to put her on the ticket with mccain and i doubt she s lobbying for it _meta_end_dot_

 let s list some reasons why she wouldn t be on the ticket there are plenty more reasons why rice won t be seriously considered for the veep position _meta_end_dot_

 for instance we haven t had an unmarried president since james buchanan _meta_end_dot_

 you may remember him from history class the end of his single term roughly coincided with the beginning of the civil war _meta_end_dot_

 if someone is going to break the barrier on unmarried candidates for national office i doubt it s going to be an unmarried mildly pro choice black woman associated with the most unpopular president in recent memory especially since it would require her getting the support of the convention delegates at this year s gop convention _meta_end_dot_

 so why is this story out there circulating in the press _meta_end_question_

 probably as a variant on that gop theme of concealing their utter disinterest in concerns and needs of african americans _meta_end_dot_

 every couple years or so the gop talks about how they re going to reach out to attract african american voters and this time by gosh they really mean it _meta_end_exclamation_

 whenever they do it they get credulous reporters to steno the story _meta_end_dot_

 the gop never does of course so why do they say they re serious about getting a larger share of the black vote _meta_end_question_

 the gop says they re reaching out for black votes to assuage the concerns of swing voters who don t want to be associated with a party that is perceived as uncaring about african americans _meta_end_dot_

 the mccain campaign knowing the gop rank and file as they must will never consider condoleezza rice to be mccain s running mate _meta_end_dot_

 but the gop wants swing voters to think that an african american could have a legitimate chance to be on a republican ticket so those swing voters don t wonder if voting for a republican is tantamount to voting for not caring about the _meta_number_ref_ _meta_percent_ref_ of their fellow americans who are black _meta_end_dot_
