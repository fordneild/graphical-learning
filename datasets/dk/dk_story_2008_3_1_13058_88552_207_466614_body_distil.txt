  peter y _meta_end_dot_

 sussman is a journalist a former editor of the san francisco chronicle who writes about the american justice system and prisons _meta_end_dot_

 he s also a plaintiff in the aclu s pending case against at t _meta_end_dot_

 his private records were among those that at t shared illegally with the bush administration _meta_end_dot_

 this case the only avenue left for remedy for this american and all americans who had their private calling records illegally surveilled is at the heart of the effort by the administration to grant the telcos amnesty for their illegal activity _meta_end_dot_

 here are sussman s thoughts as a plaintiff what does bush have to say about americans having their day in court _meta_end_question_

 the rest of the answer was all about fear and we ve all heard enough of that _meta_end_dot_

 which leads us back to the basic question if it was truly a legal program why do the telcos need amnesty _meta_end_question_

 okay that was a trick question _meta_end_dot_

 of course it wasn t legal and bush and the telcos certainly know it _meta_end_dot_

 what they don t want us to know is just how illegal it was how many americans were targeted why they were targeted and what the scope of this program was _meta_end_dot_

 the american people deserve their day in court _meta_end_dot_

 bush tells us to suck it up
