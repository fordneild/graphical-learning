  last week in the whys and whats of union endorsements i explained some of the basics of union political endorsements _meta_end_dot_

 union endorsements are one of the few endorsements a candidate can pick up that have significant direct material benefits _meta_end_dot_

 unions are limited to giving federal candidates no more than _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ for a primary and an additional _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ for a general election _meta_end_dot_

 therefore the value of a union endorsement to a presidential primary candidate has almost nothing to do with direct monetary contributions to the campaign _meta_end_dot_

 and the value of most endorsements isn t an overwhelming factor in how voters determine who will receive their vote _meta_end_dot_

 what makes union endorsements valuable to presidential primary candidate are the actions done on behalf of a candidate independent of the candidate s campaign _meta_end_dot_

 what s often referred to as soft money is money that was not voluntarily contributed by individuals in to a political action committee pac with the individuals express consent that the money be used for political purposes _meta_end_dot_

 unions and corporations are prohibited from contributing soft money directly to candidates and candidates and parties are prohibited from soliciting or spending soft money which for unions is money collected through union dues and for companies and corporations revenues generated through the conduct of their business _meta_end_dot_

 however unions may use their treasury money for member education which includes discussion of their endorsed candidates for elective office the main restriction on this activity is that it must be directed only to the union s members and not the general public _meta_end_dot_

 the help that unions can provide to a candidate is not limited however to their _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ pac contribution to the candidate and their internal member education with soft money _meta_end_dot_

 they can use unlimited amounts of pac money for independent expenditure campaign activity to the general public on behalf of their endorsed candidate _meta_end_dot_

 these activities can include television or radio ads direct mail or paying people to perform voter contact door to door persuasion or get out the vote gotv activities _meta_end_dot_

 the main restriction is that there can be no coordination with the candidate s campaign _meta_end_dot_

 thus unions that engage in independent expenditure campaigns must create a wall within their organization so that those members staff and officials working directly in coordination with the candidate s campaign can not convey internal information about the campaign to those conducting the independent expenditure campaign _meta_end_dot_

 finally the other main value of union endorsements is the human resources labor unions bring to the campaign _meta_end_dot_

 while unions can t pay their members to work for a candidate s campaign they can pay them to work for an independent expenditure effort and they can recruit them to volunteer to help the candidate s campaign _meta_end_dot_

 they also typically have members staff and officers who are active with local state and national democratic party organizations and these members staff and officers often have tremendous campaign skills and experience that can greatly benefit a campaign _meta_end_dot_

 union endorsements therefore can be very valuable to a candidate _meta_end_dot_

 but the value of union endorsements varies depending on how other unions endorse the willingness of unions to go beyond the act of endorsement to really working to persuade and motivate their members to support the endorsed candidate and possibly even doing an independent expenditure campaign _meta_end_dot_

 the value can also vary based on the size and distribution of the union s membership and the percentage of union members in the overall electorate _meta_end_dot_

 as of today it does not seem likely that that labor support will be decisive or possibly even significant in determining our presidential nominee _meta_end_dot_

 in some recent contested primary battles organized labor was crucial in determining the nominee _meta_end_dot_

 in _meta_number_ref_ the afl cio did a coordinated endorsement of walter mondale which helped him hold off the challenge of gary hart _meta_end_dot_

 in _meta_number_ref_ much of organized labor supported al gore which helped him defeat bill bradley in every primary _meta_end_dot_

 this year appears to be more like _meta_number_ref_ when dick gephardt rolled up several early labor endorsements but stalled in the fall and two of the biggest unions the service employees international union seiu and the american federation of state county and municipal employees afscme endorsed howard dean _meta_end_dot_

 several unions are internally divided and unable to coalesce around one of the democratic candidates _meta_end_dot_

 this is not surprising because the three leading democratic candidates hillary clinton john edwards and barack obama all have good labor records and have all been effective in their labor outreach _meta_end_dot_

 but even when unions have endorsed their impact is blunted by being split among candidates _meta_end_dot_

 john edwards was expected to be the biggest recipient of labor endorsements among the top contenders for the nomination edwards populist economic message is closest to the rhetoric and platform espoused by organized labor _meta_end_dot_

 garnering union endorsements appeared to be central to his strategy and indeed he has been endorsed by large politically active unions like the united steelworkers of america _meta_end_dot_

 but edwards who seemed like the front runner for the endorsements of some of the country s largest unions such as the seiu and the teamsters hasn t been able to close the deal _meta_end_dot_

 unions use a variety of methods to determine endorsements _meta_end_dot_

 typically some board of the union s leadership votes on endorsements usually with a leader s vote weighted in proportion to the number of members each individual represents _meta_end_dot_

 this gives greater weight to those officials who represent areas with large memberships _meta_end_dot_

 some unions mostly public employee unions represent members all over the country _meta_end_dot_

 examples are the national education association afscme and the international association of fire fighters _meta_end_dot_

 others are clustered in certain regions like the unite here an amalgamated union that represents tens of thousands of casino and hotel employees in las vegas and the dwindling textile and needle trades workforces in nyc and the carolinas _meta_end_dot_

 since most unions require a super majority to endorse a candidate officials loyal to local favorites can often block an endorsement of the most popular candidate _meta_end_dot_

 this seems to be happening with many unions _meta_end_dot_

 john edwards may or may not have the most nationally dispersed support among union leaders _meta_end_dot_

 but two of the most union heavy states in america are new york and illinois _meta_end_dot_

 thus it s very likely that loyalists to hillary clinton and barack obama have been able either individually or in tandem to block several unions from endorsing someone other than their home state favorite _meta_end_dot_

 the unions that have endorsed hillary clinton include a couple the american federation of teachers and the united transportation union with a very high percentage of their members in the new york area _meta_end_dot_

 thus their ability to communicate with members across several states is somewhat limited _meta_end_dot_

 some of the other unions that have endorsed like the united mine workers edwards have few members in the early primary states _meta_end_dot_

 and of the ten or twelve largest unions only afscme and the steelworkers have made a national endorsement and with the primaries starting in less than two months it s not likely there will be many more endorsements _meta_end_dot_

 there s also the added chess game within the seiu _meta_end_dot_

 as markos explained here the international was unable to endorse but is allowing state chapters to endorse but the effects of those state level endorsements are greatly diminished _meta_end_dot_

 in iowa the state chapter endorsed edwards but they have only a few thousand members and most of the surrounding state councils have endorsed obama _meta_end_dot_

 in new hampshire with about _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ members seiu is the largest union and they have endorsed edwards _meta_end_dot_

 that will allow seiu nh to communicate with its members _meta_end_dot_

 but since the pac money is controlled by the international union it s unlikely there will be any independent expenditure campaign on behalf of edwards _meta_end_dot_

 and reginally the biggest pool of seiu campaign workers among the best in organized labor are in new york and it s improbable that the ny state council will endorse against home state senator hillary clinton _meta_end_dot_

 finally the ability of labor to have a significant impact on the nomination with the current primary calendar isn t particularly great because there just aren t a lot of union members in the early states _meta_end_dot_

 only nevada has a union density greater than the national average of _meta_percent_ref_ of the overall workforce _meta_end_dot_

 new hampshire and iowa are slightly below the national average and south carolina is the second least unionized state in the country _meta_end_dot_

 for labor to have a bigger effect in future primaries labor will probably need to unify behind a single candidate but the early primaries states will also have to include those with more union members _meta_end_dot_
