  john mccain s comments at the adams memorial opera house in derry new hampshire thursday provide another good reason as if we needed one that so many of us would love to see his and joe lieberman s backsides as they leave washington permanently _meta_end_dot_

 uh huh _meta_end_dot_

 could you recall for us senator how many americans were killed by resistance forces in postwar korea japan and germany _meta_end_question_

 slip your mind _meta_end_question_

 well the number is zero _meta_end_dot_

 in iraq last year _meta_number_ref_ americans in uniform lost their lives _meta_end_dot_

 that fantasy of a serene pax americana is the kind of world you and your hug buddy george bush would love to persuade us we can have with no casualties no sacrifice _meta_end_dot_

 another republican illusion abetted by your new hug buddy joe lieberman _meta_end_dot_

 but don t listen to me _meta_end_dot_

 just keep pounding the _meta_number_ref_ year proposal for the next four days _meta_end_dot_

 if this approach nudges you up a few percentage points in new hampshire next tuesday and gives you momentum in your comeback campaign maybe you can put mister bush on the stage touting your proposal during the later primaries _meta_end_dot_

 then both you and joe can hug him tight all the way to november _meta_end_dot_
