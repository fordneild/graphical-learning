  back in december john mccain applied for and was certified to receive _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ in public matching funds for his presidential campaign _meta_end_dot_

 but because y all didn t check off the _meta_dollor_ref_ box on your _meta_number_ref_ tax returns no money is available for disbursement until march _meta_end_dot_

 that of course strikes me as a big problem for a campaign reporting _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_m cash on hand as of _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ compared to _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_m in debt _meta_end_dot_

 kagro x has already explained that debt which includes a line of credit drawn on the campaign s assets and a new life insurance policy on mccain because if he were to pass away his fundraising lists would lose their value as collateral basically every asset of his campaign was pledged to secure that loan _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_end_dot_

 except one _meta_end_dot_

 mccain refused to use that certified public matching amount itself as collateral against the loan as the edwards campaign had which may now free the alleged reformer to perform a crafty bit of legal legerdemain but can you opt out of the public financing system once you ve already opted in _meta_end_question_

 former fec chairman michael toner thinks it s kosher while another former fec chairman brad smith regards it as sketchy as does democratic lawyer marc elias the catch _meta_end_question_

 without a quorum there is no functioning federal election commission to free him or one that it even competent to provide him with an advisory opinion upon which he can rely _meta_end_dot_

 how crucial is this for mccain s campaign _meta_end_question_

 joe trippi in the politico piece explains as of _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ john mccain had already spent _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ towards that cap while edwards unlike mccain actually trying to abide by his commitments had kept it to _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 in the meantime as tapped s mark schmitt points out john mccain is trying to have it both ways by using the promise of matching funds as a bridge over the past month of financial peril oh and one more thing remember when john mccain pledged to accept public financing for the general election if his democratic opponent did _meta_end_question_

 because he probably doesn t anymore _meta_end_dot_
