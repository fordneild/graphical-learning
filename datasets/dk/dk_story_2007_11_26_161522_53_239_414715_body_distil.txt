 it truly is the definition of journalistic malpractice _meta_end_dot_

 wired s ryan singel isn t much kinder to klein s clearly deficient intellect time clearly gives klein free reign to do and saw whatever the f he wants _meta_end_dot_

 he is infallible no matter how badly he screws up and no matter how much disrepute his words may bring to the magazine _meta_end_dot_
