  in the wake of the bruising february _meta_number_ref_ republican primary for the special election in illinois _meta_number_ref_th district apparently the gop is not quite united behind nominee jim oberweis _meta_end_dot_

 oberweis primary opponent state sen _meta_end_dot_

 chris lauzen still has not endorsed oberweis and apparently will not until he receives an apology for what he considered unfair attacks during the primary with only three weeks to go before the special election any kind of rift between lauzen and oberweis and their respective supporters could have a significant effect on republican turnout _meta_end_dot_

 there simply isn t a lot of time before the special election for wounds to heal _meta_end_dot_

 and lauzen isn t the only powerful republican in the district who is angry at oberweis oberweis has quite a way with people it seems _meta_end_dot_

 it remains to be seen if republican anger at oberweis tactics will have a substantial effect on the march race but it can t hurt us at least _meta_end_dot_

 oberweis is already trailing among independents in a general election matchup against democrat bill foster it certainly would not behoove him to bleed the support of his fellow republicans _meta_end_dot_

 in an election that is already likely to be low turnout anything that could depress gop turnout further is fine news for democrats _meta_end_dot_
