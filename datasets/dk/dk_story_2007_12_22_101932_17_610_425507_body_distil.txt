  of course as a mormon he won t have that beer which means i get both of them _meta_end_dot_

 but more to the point in a roundabout way there s this yeah it s getting more ridiculous by the minute _meta_end_dot_

 george romney never marched with martin luther king but mitt says he was speaking figuratively that his father marched at some other time in some other place with king elsewhere but that the march was in solidarity with king _meta_end_dot_

 and therefore in romney s mind _meta_end_dot_

 with king _meta_end_dot_

 of course he never saw it either as he d claimed because he was in france at the time _meta_end_dot_

 but now it turns out he s been telling people he marched with king _meta_end_dot_

 i m sure that s figurative too _meta_end_dot_

 which brings me back to the beer _meta_end_dot_

 i m picking romney because i don t actually have to be in the same place to make it work _meta_end_dot_
