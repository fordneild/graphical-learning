  today the ny times featured an op ed from thomas kean and lee hamilton co chairs of the _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ commission _meta_end_dot_

 they reiterated the original goals of the commission then offered a stunning point blank criticism of the cia and the bush administration i am sure that it will come as no surprise to the online community that the bush administration obstructed the investigation _meta_end_dot_

 activists and _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ family members have been raving for years about the obstruction _meta_end_dot_

 but to my knowledge this is the first time the co chairs of the commission have made such serious allegations _meta_end_dot_

 kean and hamilton state that they repeatedly asked the bush administration and the cia for information regarding the interrogations of two of the detainees abu zubaydah and abd al rahim al nashiri _meta_end_dot_

 we now know that the infamous and allegedly destroyed tapes included hundreds of hours of the interrogations of these two men and yet not one word of their existence to the commission _meta_end_dot_

 the cia provided written reports of the interrogations but those reports apparently only created more confusion not content with the vagueness of the answers provided by the cia the _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ commission asked and were denied permission to interview the the detainees _meta_end_dot_

 so not only did the cia refuse the request and neglect to mention the tapes but all of the usual players tenet rumsfeld gonzales and bush cheney by extension seem to be intimately involved as well _meta_end_dot_

 it makes sense because we know that the circle of trust in the bush adminstration has always been a very exclusive club _meta_end_dot_

 hamilton and kean conclude by practically begging for an investigation _meta_end_dot_

 as of this afternoon it looks like attorney general mukasey is going to comply _meta_end_dot_

 given the recent record of investigations into the bush adminstration i don t have high hopes that justice will be done _meta_end_dot_

 but it is a new year an election year and the political winds are changing _meta_end_dot_

 stranger things have happened _meta_end_dot_
