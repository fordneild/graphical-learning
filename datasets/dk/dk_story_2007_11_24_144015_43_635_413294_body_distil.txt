  i don t mean here as in why are you sitting there in your kitchen munching a cold turkey and cranberry sandwich and wondering if you can save yourself from tryptophan poisoning by a well timed call to papa john s _meta_end_dot_

 i don t even mean why are you at your keyboard when you still have visiting relatives you haven t seen since uncle bill s funeral _meta_end_dot_

 this is the big question the ultimate existential question _meta_end_dot_

 the whole does this well nigh infinite universe have a purpose and are we a part of that purpose question _meta_end_dot_

 a couple of decades ago evolutionary biologist stephen j _meta_end_dot_

 gould put out the construct that science and religion were non overlapping magisteria _meta_end_dot_

 that is that some questions belonged to science others to religion and that the venn diagram of the questions that could be addressed by either would show no area of overlap _meta_end_dot_

 that certainly seems to be true when it comes to religious folks seeking some kind of scientific validation for their beliefs _meta_end_dot_

 not only has evolution wrung the genesis out of human origins cosmology has pressed the origin of everything back to to ridiculously small fractions of a second after the big bang _meta_end_dot_

 with the inherent messiness of quantum mechanics the bulging standard model and unanswered questions about the bulk of the material that makes up the universe we haven t quite reached mark twain s deterministic pinball machine but there seems little room for facts not resolvable within the magisteria of science _meta_end_dot_

 except _meta_end_dot_

 not all the answers about the universe can be found in the universe _meta_end_dot_

 the concerns paul davies addresses in cosmic jackpot are not about the how of the universe but the why _meta_end_dot_

 specifically why are the rules of the universe as they are _meta_end_dot_

 if the universe was a dvd what davies wants to know is who wrote the specs for reading that dvd _meta_end_question_

 why are so many of the constants and rules that define the universe so precisely right to allow matter to exist to keep the stars burning over long periods to permit life to exist to allow us to exist _meta_end_dot_

 anyone who has ever looked into the search for extraterrestrial intelligence is bound to have run into the drake equation a series of values that define the possibility of encountering another intelligent race _meta_end_dot_

 depending on the values that are entered into the equation other civilizations may be common or vanishingly rare _meta_end_dot_

 davies projects a much longer equation one in which all the varied rules of physics conspire against life and variation of almost any of these values limits the possible civilizations to a firm zero _meta_end_dot_

 that brings him back to the question of why why are all the rules so perfect as to allow us to be here pondering why the rules are all so perfect as to allow us to be here pondering _meta_end_dot_

 whack er okay _meta_end_dot_

 it s not exactly a new question _meta_end_dot_

 a lot of what davies is pondering is the debate between the weak and strong versions of the anthropic principle _meta_end_dot_

 the weak version says the universe is friendly to intelligent life because we re here to observe it so does the strong one _meta_end_dot_

 the difference is all in what word gets stressed _meta_end_dot_

 under the weak theory the universe is coincidentally benevolent and we wouldn t be here to wonder about it otherwise _meta_end_dot_

 under the strong theory we are the point of the universe _meta_end_dot_

 were it not for us there would be no one around to admire the universe the rules and eva green _meta_end_dot_

 call it a high universal vanity constant the universe just really really wants to be seen _meta_end_dot_

 if it occurs to you that this is the cosmological equivalent of the old if a tree falls in the forest question you are precisely right _meta_end_dot_

 if it occurs to you that cosmologists spend a lot of time considering ideas that others would confine to stand up routines you re right again _meta_end_dot_

 so what does davies bring to the table _meta_end_question_

 too a large extent an approachable style that makes such a tangled question more open to a debate that doesn t include overuse of exponents and mu something or others though approachable is relative so if you failed to make it to the back cover of a brief history of time think twice about diving in here _meta_end_dot_

 somewhat arbitrarily davies reduces the candidates for the why you so nice to us universe pageant down to three candidates _meta_end_dot_

 the first answer is luck _meta_end_dot_

 everything could have gone wrong but it didn t and we re here so sit back and marvel at the fact that a quarter was tossed a few billion times and it came up heads every time _meta_end_dot_

 barring any other evidence this candidate looks like a winner to most scientists especially since one aspect of current cosmological theory is the existence of multiple infinite in fact side by side universes of which we happen to live in the garden universe _meta_end_dot_

 there s this universe an inifinite number of universes almost like this one an infinite number of universes where things are wildly different and an infinite number of universes without shrimp _meta_end_dot_

 most scientists at the weak end of the athropic line have already awarded this contestant the crown _meta_end_dot_

 however davies doesn t find that candidate appealing for a number of reasons _meta_end_dot_

 neither does he like the idea that the rules of the universe were stamped in place by an external force a point where gould s magisteria touch leaving us with an observable universe as the maker s mark of a benevolent creator _meta_end_dot_

 one big point that he argues against each is that because each solution requires actions occurring outside our universe they are also outside our ability to test or observe _meta_end_dot_

 that makes either solution an unprovable theory and so bad science _meta_end_dot_

 instead davies goes for contestant number three one that might be called the sampson of strong anthropic theories _meta_end_dot_

 he thinks we re doing it _meta_end_dot_

 just as the act of observation interferes with particles in quantum states davies posits that our observation shapes the universe not just now but from the very beginning _meta_end_dot_

 in the ultimate closed system our thoughts in a way unspecified shape the universe into one that can be observed _meta_end_dot_

 poof _meta_end_exclamation_

 we are all become that other aspect of shiva creator of worlds _meta_end_dot_

 it s an interesting involving and sometimes infuriating read as some of the failings davies levels against his runner up theories seem equally true of his chosen winner _meta_end_dot_

 in many ways his search for a consciousness based cosmology is reminiscent of string theory _meta_end_dot_

 both are intellectually appealing in that they bring a sense of order to something that is otherwise woven out of chaos and chance _meta_end_dot_

 parts of his discussion will no doubt resurface as a kind of intelligent design for physicists again not an altogether new idea as looking for the mathematical equivalent of slartibartfast s signature has been around for a long time _meta_end_dot_

 at the moment i m unconvinced _meta_end_dot_

 however i think i ll go take a walk in the fall woods and look around _meta_end_dot_

 there are deer out there wild turkeys and still a few stubborn oak leaves clinging in the branches _meta_end_dot_

 i d hate to think they all disappeared for lack of my observation _meta_end_dot_
