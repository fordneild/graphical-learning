  the cheney bush administration has tortured logic and common sense over the past several years in its declarations that it does not engage in torture _meta_end_dot_

 steven g _meta_end_dot_

 bradbury acting head of the justice department s office of legal counsel is one of many administration officials who has made this clear _meta_end_dot_

 one example can be found at a white house web site q a from september _meta_number_ref_ just one problem _meta_end_dot_

 shortly after the justice department declared torture abhorrent in a december _meta_number_ref_ memo and the administration seemed to have given up the claim that the president had nearly unlimited power to order barbaric interrogations if he so chose bradbury himself wrote secret memos arguing that various brutal techniques including that wonder of euphemisms waterboarding would be perfectly okay under certain circumstances as long as they did not cross the u s _meta_end_dot_

 supreme court s bright line and shock the conscience some people s consciences are obviously easier to shock than others _meta_end_dot_

 some are apparently well armored against shocks _meta_end_dot_

 stunning in their arrogant malignancy these memoranda and other aspects of bradbury s aggressively defensive role as acting chief at the office of legal counsel have held up mister bush s effort to give him the job permanently _meta_end_dot_

 russ feingold dick durbin ted kennedy and others stand in the way _meta_end_dot_

 and so two years after being nominated for the post bradbury remains interim that s the case with quite a few jobs in the administration these days acting heads running this or that department either because the president can t get or won t try to get them confirmed by the senate _meta_end_dot_

 and there are also quite a score of judicial appointments hanging fire too _meta_end_dot_

 naturally according to the white house it s all because of obstructionist democrats _meta_end_dot_

 uh huh _meta_end_dot_

 on wednesday senator majority leader harry reid revealed otherwise _meta_end_dot_

 reid said he had tried to work out a deal with the administration that would have allowed recess appointments or senate confirmations _meta_end_dot_

 it must have been christmas spirit or something _meta_end_dot_

 or perhaps reid just wanted to give mister bush one more opportunity to get the democrats to give something up something for nothing before the holidays _meta_end_dot_

 bush apparently told reid it s bradbury or nobody a champion of torture vs _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ appointments _meta_end_dot_

 reid gave mister bush the appropriate answer in december keeping the senate in session for _meta_number_ref_ seconds a day over the holidays so that the president couldn t slip bradbury from acting to permanent as a recess appointment _meta_end_dot_

 in this final year of swagger and smirk mister bush is rapidly approaching self parody _meta_end_dot_

 less than _meta_number_ref_ months from now he will depart unscathed and uncaring leaving behind tangles of wreckage at home and abroad and having set a precedent that progressives should press the next president to repudiate in word and deed _meta_end_dot_
