 imagine that it took _meta_number_ref_ seconds to break a mentally ill subject who then lied his ass off to get it to stop _meta_end_dot_

 now we have a guy who has actually waterboarded a suspected terrorist calling it torture _meta_end_dot_

 in effect this guy has admitted to breaking the law possibly even committing a war crime _meta_end_dot_
