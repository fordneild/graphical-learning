  with congress back in session and the fight over fisa set to begin once more dick cheney emerged from his undisclosed location to lead the administration s crusade to protect the telecommunication companies _meta_end_dot_

 speaking before a gathering of neocons and cons cheney began with thanks a little self deprecating humor and a joke he then moved on to why congress must act now to protect telecom companies the administration our nation you get the idea _meta_end_dot_

 then came some points of fact now let s look at some points of fact that are actually based on facts _meta_end_dot_

 the bush administration s warrantless wiretapping program came to light because of an article in the new york times and until that time it s unclear how many members of congress were even aware of the program _meta_end_dot_

 and during a january _meta_number_ref_ press conference george bush contradicts cheney s claim that mcconnell alerted them to a problem and that they asked congress to fix it _meta_end_dot_

 so much for cheney s assertion that they wanted congress to change the law _meta_end_dot_

 it should be noted that during that press conference bush also gave what was perhaps the first hint that he would protect telecommunication companies while at the same time admitting that he knowingly broke the law given that fisa wasn t an old law it was the law ignoring it was breaking the law _meta_end_dot_

 but back to cheney s speech and the all important protection for those patriotic telecommunication companies _meta_end_dot_

 no they aren t facing lawsuits because they are believed to have aided the government they are facing lawsuits because they are believed to have broken the law _meta_end_dot_

 and while bearing responsibility for illegal acts is an alien concept to this administration it is hoped that congress still has some respect left for the rule of law _meta_end_dot_

 and after spending a few moments lamenting the possible damage to those companies reputation cheney made another joke hilarious _meta_end_dot_

 because as we now know the only reason those companies won t comply with requests to protect american lives is if they aren t paid _meta_end_dot_

 then came the money quote who knew _meta_end_question_

 only immunity for the companies that broke the law will prevent another _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 of course it will also prevent the american people from ever learning the scope of the warrantless illegal domestic spying by this administration _meta_end_dot_

 and that of course is the whole point _meta_end_dot_
