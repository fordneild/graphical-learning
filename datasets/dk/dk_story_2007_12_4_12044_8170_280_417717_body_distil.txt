  yesterday i noted giuliani s downward trajectory in rasmussen s daily tracking point in the wake of the sex on the city scandal _meta_end_dot_

 today that collapse shows no sign of ebbing _meta_end_dot_

 remember the politico story broke on the _meta_number_ref_th and started gathering steam over the next couple of days blunting what appears to be a post debate bounce for giuliani _meta_end_dot_

 so in the national polls giuliani who has spent _meta_dollor_ref_ million is tied with the guy who has spent _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ million _meta_end_dot_

 meanwhile the rest of the big spenders in the gop field are gasping for air further back _meta_end_dot_
