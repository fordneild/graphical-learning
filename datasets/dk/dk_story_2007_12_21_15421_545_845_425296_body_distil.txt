  a key bloc of swing voters in many rust belt states is this rough characterization or what sociologists might call an ideal type white male with a high school diploma and maybe an associate s degree but no four year college degree not particularly religious but attends church occasionally probably catholic or non evangelical protestant like lutheran makes between _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ and _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ per year may have a white collar job like computer aided design or shipping clerk but more likely to work in a plant as skilled labor or as a skilled tradesman in the construction industry _meta_end_dot_

 doesn t care much about the culture wars and may have a reasonable division of labor in housework and childcare but is still probably a bit macho thinks government often screws things up but isn t inherently hostile to government _meta_end_dot_

 if voting in the _meta_number_ref_ s he probably voted for reagan _meta_end_dot_

 if he voted in _meta_number_ref_ he may have voted for clinton but guys like him made up a huge share of the perot vote _meta_end_dot_

 in _meta_number_ref_ he was more likely to vote for bush than gore but not by huge numbers and not with any particular pro bush zeal _meta_end_dot_

 one other thing chances are good he hunts and owns a gun _meta_end_dot_

 most of the men in my family fit this description _meta_end_dot_

 i grew up around guns _meta_end_dot_

 i was taught to hunt as a kid and while i don t hunt anymore i did shoot a deer on my _meta_number_ref_th birthday _meta_end_dot_

 some in my dad s family weren t the most responsible people you could meet especially in situations that involved alcohol and motor vehicles _meta_end_dot_

 but i was taught impeccable gun and hunting safety _meta_end_dot_

 within minutes of hearing the first reports of the cheney shooting incident i knew that that my family would never have let cheney hunt with us because he and his party were just too reckless _meta_end_dot_

 but a lot of them voted for bush cheney _meta_end_dot_

 both times _meta_end_dot_

 much is made of the clout of the nra and they certainly have been an effective force in swaying guys likes the ones i described _meta_end_dot_

 mercifully my family has generally been immune to their demagoguery in the _meta_number_ref_ gun owners came out in force to vote against democrats for passing what they considered anti gun legislation _meta_end_dot_

 gore had to fight off anti gun fears in places with lots of gun owners like pennsylvania new mexico the non coastal areas of oregon and washington and the great lakes states _meta_end_dot_

 but times were generally good in _meta_number_ref_ especially for the middle class _meta_end_dot_

 in the late _meta_number_ref_ s real incomes rose in the us for the first time since _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 many of the gun owning swing voters were buying suv s and helping fuel the consumer boom with money from their renegotiated low interest home equity loans _meta_end_dot_

 union members in the manufacturing and building trades were being bombarded with the message that gun rights don t matter if you can t make enough money to buy a gun the message was somewhat effective as even white male union members tended to remain with the democrats _meta_end_dot_

 but for the rest of that swing voter group the gun message worked they were more worried about having their guns taken away than about not having the money to buy them _meta_end_dot_

 times have changed gruesome is a good word to describe some of the economic numbers surfacing in recent months and not just on the producer side of the firearm business _meta_end_dot_

 consumer and housing numbers are looking very bad especially in swing states such as colorado florida iowa michigan nevada new hampshire and oregon _meta_end_dot_

 on the federal level bush has decided to conduct a war without forcing the american public to chose between guns and butter he cut taxes hasn t asked for any sacrifices and for a while could buy both guns and butter on credit _meta_end_dot_

 but that kind of irresponsible spending has contributed to the growing economic and credit problems being felt especially hard by the middle class _meta_end_dot_

 the numbers from the gun producers and sellers suggest that in their personal finance decisions americans are opting against guns _meta_end_dot_

 in a little over ten months we ll learn if the white middle class gun owners i described will make the political decision based on a preference for butter before guns _meta_end_dot_
