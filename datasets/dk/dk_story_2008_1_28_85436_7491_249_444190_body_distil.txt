  from the great state of maine _meta_end_dot_

 please sir may i have another _meta_end_question_

 what in the world can bush possibly say in his state of the union address tonight _meta_end_question_

 i mean what can he possibly say _meta_end_question_

 seriously i never underestimate these speeches _meta_end_dot_

 his writers are very good and they re working overtime to walk that fine line between soaring empty rhetoric and just plain old empty rhetoric _meta_end_dot_

 lots of wings taking dream and our childrens is learning and all that but probably no talk of the british government learning about significant quantities of uranium from africa this time i m guessing _meta_end_dot_

 still despite their best efforts the applause will be more tepid than usual as bush dutifully reads the words on his prompter _meta_end_dot_

 congress will start fidgeting in their seats sooner except john boehner who will be a virtual viagra commercial during the whole thing well except when bush says madam speaker which will temporarily kill his woody _meta_end_dot_

 viewers those who have the stomach to watch mostly for comic value will play their drinking games with a little less enthusiasm _meta_end_dot_

 take a swig every time he says aw screw it just take a swig whenever you feel like it _meta_end_dot_

 and the world will turn roughly _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_th of a revolution meaning one less hour we ll have to live with this mealy mouthed moron yammering at us through the teevee _meta_end_dot_

 with his tragic legacy virtually sealed in the amber of history he only has one play left reviving the manned mission to mars _meta_end_dot_

 if he does it right it could be a proud moment for us all one giant leap for something something something and all that _meta_end_dot_

 heady stuff _meta_end_dot_

 i hope to see you in the sotu threads here tonight _meta_end_dot_

 bush s last stand is a benchmark worth celebrating together _meta_end_dot_

 meanwhile cheers and jeers starts in there s moreville _meta_end_dot_
