  bumped susan it s no secret that democrats are energized this primary season turning out in record numbers in the primarys and caucuses held thus far _meta_end_dot_

 gerald seib writing in the wall street journal yesterday admits that the intensity gap is quite large between the republican base and demcoratic base _meta_end_dot_

 however he doesn t think it s insurmountable _meta_end_dot_

 among the solutions for revving up the republican base _meta_end_question_

 so it looks like the three options for increasing republican turnout and energizing that base are _meta_number_ref_ a terrorist attack which would scare the shit out of voters of all stripes who would show up in droves to vote for mccain _meta_number_ref_ hillary clinton as the nominee because clinton hatred apparently ranks only slightly lower than terrorist attacks in terms of scaring the shit out of republican voters and _meta_number_ref_ a drawn out democratic primary _meta_end_dot_

 the problem _meta_end_question_

 well the biggest problem with this strategy can desperate hope be properly labeled a strategy is that all of these items are outside of the republican party s control _meta_end_dot_

 indeed where democratic enthusiasm and record turnout is based positives namely on a genuine desire for change and vibrant support for individual candidates republicans are banking on negatives to rally the base _meta_end_dot_

 i think republicans greatly underestimate how damn ready the democratic base is for change _meta_end_dot_

 the record turnout numbers thus far evidence a burning desire to do something to cleanse the american palate of the last eight years of republican mal governance _meta_end_dot_

 our party harbors intense deep scars from the late _meta_number_ref_s the _meta_number_ref_ election the _meta_number_ref_ election and countless outrages in between _meta_end_dot_

 left smoldering for nearly a decade that resentment and that feeling of anger is reaching a boiling point simmering up and melding in with a genuine hope and expectation that this time around this election america will get it right _meta_end_dot_

 that america needs to get it right _meta_end_dot_

 a drawn out primary season or clinton as the nominee or the inevitable playing of the fear card won t temper that groundswell of engaged and inspired democratic voters despite republican hopes to the contrary _meta_end_dot_

 for democrats there s too much at stake not to jump in _meta_end_dot_

 and for republicans _meta_end_question_

 their lackluster slate of politicians who proffer nothing but stale policies and stilted rhetoric give republicans every reason to sit this one out _meta_end_dot_
