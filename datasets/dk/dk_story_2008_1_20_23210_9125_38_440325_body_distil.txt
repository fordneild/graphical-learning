  the conscience of a liberal w w _meta_end_dot_

 norton and company inc _meta_end_dot_

 back in the _meta_number_ref_ s paul krugman regularly irritated the crap out of me _meta_end_dot_

 in the profession of academic economics he was recognized as a major figure _meta_end_dot_

 he was awarded the john bates clark medal which goes to those adjudged to be the top american economist under the age of _meta_number_ref_ and is often a precursor to the nobel prize in economics _meta_end_dot_

 krugman appeared to be a liberal and he was a gifted writer _meta_end_dot_

 but instead of using his prodigious gifts to help out liberals or so it seemed to me back then he appeared to most relish lampooning those he characterized as liberal policy entrepreneurs like lester thurow and robert riech as he did in _meta_number_ref_ s peddling prosperity economic sense and nonsense in the age of diminished expectations _meta_end_dot_

 back then krugman was bullish on international trade and he was merciless in exposing what he thought was the shallowness of the strategic trade advocates who had a brief period of influence at the beginning of the clinton administration _meta_end_dot_

 krugman was dismissive toward economists with celebrity status such as john kenneth galbraith whom he used as his model of one of the first policy entrepreneurs krugman wasn t dismissive of people who wrote for a general audience john maynard keynes wrote for the popular press and did so prolifically and brilliantly _meta_end_dot_

 when keynes was writing however there really wasn t much of a profession of economics and he wrote primarily about policy not party politics _meta_end_dot_

 by the time galbraith came along economics had become an established academic discipline and he was largely disdained by academic economists in part because he did write about politics and didn t treat economics like it was separate from politics _meta_end_dot_

 in peddling prosperity the best krugman could say about him was that _meta_end_dot_

 krugman wrote peddling prosperity early in the clinton administration before the gingrich takeover of congress _meta_end_dot_

 it was primarily a critique of popular economic policies _meta_end_dot_

 krugman was being keynes _meta_end_dot_

 but in the intervening years seeing the radicalism of gingrich and movement conservatism the radicalism of the bush administration and the assaults on the new deal and the american middle class krugman has realized that there is a time for policy but that liberal policy requires a progressive movement _meta_end_dot_

 much as galbraith was a major liberal voice on economic matters in the post war era krugman has decided he needs to be a liberal voice on economic matters in support of a progressive movement to defend and extend the new deal _meta_end_dot_

 he still values rigorous economic theory research and practice _meta_end_dot_

 but he now knows that liberal policy will get nowhere without the triumph of progressive politics _meta_end_dot_

 to that end he has written the conscience of a liberal _meta_end_dot_

 this book which will endure as one of the fundamental political statements of our era an era we hope and have reason to believe will become the next progressive era when liberal ideals are achieved by a progressive political movement which elects more and better democrats and then pushes those democrats to complete the promises of the new deal _meta_end_dot_

 the argument of krugman s book is simple yet audacious coming as it does from someone at the heart of establishment academia and media being a liberal is not enough however _meta_end_dot_

 to enact liberal policies and nurture american democracy it is necessary to have a progressive movement one which includes mainstays of the traditional liberal movement such as a revitalized labor movement with novel entities like the netroots the virtual community held together by bloggers and progressive websites like daily kos which now attracts regular postings from leading democratic politicians but unlike movement conservatism which is a top down phenomena the progressive movement krugman embraces is not centralized these statements come near the end of the book when any reasonably liberal person would realize the dire need for a progressive movement and the tremendous opportunity available to tough committed and idealistic progressives _meta_end_dot_
