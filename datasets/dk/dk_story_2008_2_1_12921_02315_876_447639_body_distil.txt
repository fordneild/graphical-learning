  wapo yowza _meta_end_dot_

 now look _meta_end_dot_

 there was a lot of flack for riding albeit very very slowly grampa fred thompson while he was imperceptibly in the race _meta_end_dot_

 and more than a few out there thought it was ageism it might have been but it was also a commentary on his marked and well known lack of energy which is a serious impediment to performing in the presidency _meta_end_dot_

 many fear that the same such attack on mccain though would create a backlash against those who launched it _meta_end_dot_

 and they re probably right _meta_end_dot_

 although mccain s actually older than thompson there just isn t the same doubt about mccain s ability to motivate himself to work hard _meta_end_dot_

 so it really would just be about his age _meta_end_dot_

 only here s the thing if the dirty lib ruls raise questions about mccain s age it s an unfair underhanded attack discriminatory and intolerant in its nature and indicative of a disconnect between them and america s true values _meta_end_dot_

 but if the cold unfeeling invisible hand at whose altar conservatives themselves purport to worship raises the question _meta_end_question_

 well that s just business _meta_end_exclamation_
