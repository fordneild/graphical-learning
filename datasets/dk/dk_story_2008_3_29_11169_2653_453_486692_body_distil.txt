  it s reprehensible enough when an american president puts soldiers in harm s way to make a political point _meta_end_dot_

 but the gop has placed american soldiers at the whim of iraqi prime minister nuri al maliki turning our forces into pawns between political rivals _meta_end_dot_

 our soldiers may never surrender but the bush administration john mccain and blind supporters of this war have been more than willing to surrender our forces to outside control _meta_end_dot_

 coming right on the heels of iraq visits from both mccain and cheney it s clear that maliki knows the real situation _meta_end_dot_

 he knows that he can strike openly at his enemies and the us military will be forced to expend blood and dollars to back up his threats _meta_end_dot_

 as the us is increasingly forced to bear the cost of maliki s political decisions and bush cheney and mccain continue to sing of progress you have to wonder if any of these men has learned what maliki clearly knows _meta_end_dot_

 when the puppetmaster tries to control the puppet the strings go both ways _meta_end_dot_
