 moe _meta_number_ref_ _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ results average of six polls there s not a whole lot of movement here _meta_end_dot_

 the numbers have bounced around a bit but most of the disparity between the pollsters is probably due to different screens to determine likely voters _meta_end_dot_

 it s notoriously difficult to poll for a primary because it s hard to use past primaries as a model especially when the composition of the electorate is changing in this case with tnes of thousands of voters changing their registration to democratic _meta_end_dot_

 a month ago clinton was polling _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ points ahead of obama in pennsylvania _meta_end_dot_

 now obama has gotten the margin down to about _meta_number_ref_ with _meta_number_ref_ days left before primary day _meta_end_dot_

 some of that movement was due to pennsylvania voters not knowing obama _meta_end_dot_

 in every state initial polls a month or two out from election day show obama performing much worse than he s performed in the end _meta_end_dot_

 clinton also took a hit in late march most likely from her walter mitty moments of falsely claiming to have been under sniper fire _meta_end_dot_

 clinton appears to have stabilized after the hemorrhaging of the sniper stories _meta_end_dot_

 if the election were held today it appears that she would do just as everyone has always expected and win the pennsylvania primary by a clear but modest margin _meta_end_dot_

 in other words while she may slightly cut the delegate gap by a dozen or so she does not appear to be on path to a big win that can put her back in contention for the nomination _meta_end_dot_

 the only decisive result that appears possible is for obama to narrow the gap and either finish a few points behind clinton or possibly even win it _meta_end_dot_

 for clinton to have an argument that she s got momentum she probably has to win pa by _meta_number_ref_ points or more something that would be seen as a major throttling of obama _meta_end_dot_

 but a _meta_number_ref_ point win will do her very little good and won t open up the financial spigots to help her make up her deficits in north carolina or hold on to her very narrow leads in indiana _meta_end_dot_

 obama should be expected to have a strong ground game he has in most states _meta_end_dot_

 clinton has much of the pa dem leadership in her corner so her ground game should also be good _meta_end_dot_

 if the clinton team is able to use the press to leak out something damaging to obama in the final _meta_number_ref_ hours before the campaign they may be able to separate from obama and post a win of over _meta_number_ref_ points _meta_end_dot_

 if clinton is hurt again between now and the _meta_number_ref_nd obama might be able to close within _meta_number_ref_ points or even win outright _meta_end_dot_

 but based on the polls today the most likely outcome appears to be a clear but modest clinton win that proves little other than that she was able to use her demographic and political advantages to eke out an ok win in a state where she was always expected to win _meta_end_dot_

 should that happen we ll have to look ahead to north carolina and indiana for a more decisive outcome that may finally force her to admit that she cannot win and that barack obama will be the democratic nominee _meta_end_dot_
