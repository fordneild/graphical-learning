  super delegates can vote however they want _meta_end_dot_

 that s the rule _meta_end_dot_

 and as far as i m concerned they should vote for whoever leads the pledged delegate race or risk a civil war within the party _meta_end_dot_

 of course that case is weakened if clinton were to take away obama s lead in the popular vote currently at around _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ votes and i m sure that must be what clinton s camp must be hoping for _meta_end_dot_

 if she overtakes obama in the popular vote it would denote a massive collapse in obama s campaign that would make his staunchest defenders pause and consider whether he is truly the best general election candidate for us _meta_end_dot_

 i don t expect it to happen but it s the clinton campaign s hail mary _meta_end_dot_

 all that aside what if the super delegates decided in the interest of democracy to vote for the winner of their states _meta_end_question_

 let s see how that would stack up _meta_end_dot_

 i went with popular vote wins which means clinton picks up the supers in nevada and texas despite losing the delegate count _meta_end_dot_

 i m using the green papers delegate counts which i assume to be accurate but could always be off _meta_end_dot_

 obama would love that just fine up to this point _meta_end_dot_

 with his _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ pledged delegate lead he could afford to lose five net delegates factoring the supers this way _meta_end_dot_

 that would also put his current count at around using nbc s total _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ to clinton s _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 there are _meta_number_ref_ delegates from prior contests still unallocated let s game this out however and apportion the super delegates according to the cw over who will take each of the remaining states now i think indiana is actually going to be fertile ground for obama but i ll keep it with clinton so i can avoid the easy charges of bias _meta_end_dot_

 i am but not in this analysis even then there s not much ground to be made up by clinton based on a super delegates vote their states approach _meta_end_dot_

 obama would lead based on existing tallies and these projections _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ to _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ or a deficit of _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 she s not going to make that up with the remaining _meta_number_ref_ or so remaining pledged delegates _meta_end_dot_

 by the way if those were split down the middle rounding up in clinton s favor obama would come out with about _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ delegates to clinton s _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 obama needs _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ to win _meta_end_dot_

 he s the nominee _meta_end_dot_

 bottom line _meta_end_question_

 she s not going to catch up in the pledged delegate race _meta_end_dot_

 she wouldn t gain enough supers by forcing them to vote their states even though she won the states with the biggest super delegate totals _meta_end_dot_

 so what s left _meta_end_question_

 absent an epic collapse by team obama her only chance will be coup by super delegate cajoling the supers to abandon the will of the voters _meta_end_dot_

 yes it is within the rules _meta_end_dot_

 but like i said above that way lies civil war _meta_end_dot_
