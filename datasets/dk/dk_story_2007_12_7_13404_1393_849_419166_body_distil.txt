  let s review _meta_end_dot_

 last week republicans had their youtube debate one in which huckabee was widely considered to have won and yes he nailed it _meta_end_dot_

 in the opening sequence of the debate as the republicans on stage tried to one up themselves on how evil they d be to undocumented immigrants and their children huckabee stood apart as a sane voice _meta_end_dot_

 he defended giving scholarships to worthy children of undocumented parents _meta_end_dot_

 he said things like and and he scored _meta_end_dot_

 scored big _meta_end_dot_

 he went from _meta_number_ref_ points pre debate to _meta_number_ref_ points today _meta_end_dot_

 all of the anti immigrant hate mongers went backwards _meta_end_dot_

 he seemed authentic _meta_end_dot_

 appeared to have a heart _meta_end_dot_

 didn t snarl on stage scapegoating other people for votes _meta_end_dot_

 but something weird happened _meta_end_dot_

 he became a front runner and it looks like people started whispering in his ear _meta_end_dot_

 because now he has released an immigration plan that is nothing short of regressive _meta_end_dot_

 and most ridiculous amongst its tenets _meta_end_question_

 barred from future reentry _meta_end_question_

 isn t that the whole point of undocumented immigration that they didn t ask for permission to enter _meta_end_question_

 not to mention he gives them six four months to get out _meta_end_dot_

 they don t _meta_end_dot_

 then what s he going to do about it _meta_end_question_

 send chuck norris after them _meta_end_question_

 huckabee is the new mccain someone who was gaining traction with voters because he wasn t pandering to the worst segments of his party _meta_end_dot_

 he was being himself _meta_end_dot_

 as with mccain that brief moment in time has passed _meta_end_dot_

 he s no longer different than the rest of his colleagues on that stage _meta_end_dot_
