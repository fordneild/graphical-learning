  think progress has taken note of a little item you can read the details about at usaspending gov federal paper shredding contracts are up sixfold since the last clinton budget and headed for _meta_dollor_ref_ million plus this year _meta_end_dot_

 each horizontal line in that graphic to the left represents half a million bucks _meta_end_dot_

 at first i thought that perhaps cheney bush had decided from experience that their fears the democrats would be digging through gop trash and find something prosecutable had proved overblown so they had accordingly reduced their shredding activities _meta_end_dot_

 but it turns out that the _meta_number_ref_ bar only covers through part of the third quarter of this fiscal year _meta_end_dot_

 it sure was cheaper when the white house had the likes of fawn hall doing the shredding in house instead of outsourcing the job _meta_end_dot_
