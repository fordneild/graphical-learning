  remember ed rollins _meta_end_question_

 ronald reagan s political director and _meta_number_ref_ campaign manager _meta_end_question_

 after he managed christie todd whitman s _meta_number_ref_ nj gubernatorial victory over jim florio he boasted about his campaign s outreach to african americans most of the reporters in the room didn t mention rollins boast of voter suppression but the story eventually got out _meta_end_dot_

 rollins initially claimed the boast was essentially a joke to needle florio campaign manager james carville but as the controversy went on his explanations got more convoluted _meta_end_dot_

 the nj democratic party filed charges to annul the election results but the case and the story eventually faded _meta_end_dot_

 why did rollins make such an impolitic boast _meta_end_question_

 one theory is that he was essentially advertising to prospective clients that he was especially clever at keeping down the overwhelmingly democratic black vote _meta_end_dot_

 it s always seemed a plausible explanation because few on the right condemned him _meta_end_dot_

 on the contrary they generally accepted that he did in fact pay off ministers but that what he did was equivalent to democrats who spend walking around money on gotv efforts to increase voter turnout _meta_end_dot_

 obviously this is a cynical if not moronic interpretation because it blurs the difference between spending money to encourage voter participation with spending money to discourage it _meta_end_dot_

 rollins has continued on as a prominent tv pundit but he did pay a professional price for his comments he s barely participated in campaigns since _meta_end_dot_

 as harold meyerson put it in the wapo rollins wasn t drummed out of the profession because of republican outrage over his actions _meta_end_dot_

 no it was because he was too loose lipped about a favored republican strategy _meta_end_dot_

 some may think that s a cynical interpretation _meta_end_dot_

 but there s plenty of evidence that republicans don t mind suppressing african american votes just look at the _meta_number_ref_ and _meta_number_ref_ elections _meta_end_dot_

 and now even rollins has apparently been redeemed enough to be drummed back in to running republican campaigns we know that the republican party wants to return to the days before women s suffrage child labor laws and eugenics when it was acceptable for americans to use torture _meta_end_dot_

 huckabee has already made it clear he would like to roll back many of the social advances of the _meta_number_ref_th century like feminism the incarceration of the diseased and the acceptance of science _meta_end_dot_

 now by hiring ed rollins we see that he apparently doesn t care whether we might also backslide in the direction of jim crow _meta_end_dot_
