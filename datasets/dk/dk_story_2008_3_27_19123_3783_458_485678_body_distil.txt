  has worked pretty well for the cheney bush regime the past few months _meta_end_dot_

 it certainly calmed down the megamedia which after years of publishing and broadcasting stuff about iraq quaffed from the kool aid fire hose had actually started doing the job they should have started in january _meta_number_ref_ when the white house initiated its march to war publicity tour _meta_end_dot_

 after years of fawning and phony patriotism in the aftermath of september _meta_number_ref_ the megamedia finally began to make visible some ugly truths that had previously been confined to the world of the bloggerati _meta_end_dot_

 then came the surge the escalation designed to undermine the lukewarm recommendations of the iraq study group _meta_end_dot_

 within a couple of months the coverage except for the mcclatchy people and a few others whom you can call journalists without meaning the word as an epithet were right back where editor and publisher editor greg mitchell wrote about in so wrong for so long how the press the pundits and the president failed on iraq _meta_end_dot_

 as i noted two weeks ago in megamedia coverage on iraq fuels ignorance one measure of how lousy coverage of the war affected americans was the plunge in those who knew how many of their fellow americans had died because of the iraq invasion and occupation _meta_end_dot_

 in august _meta_number_ref_ _meta_percent_ref_ could correctly put the number of deaths at _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 by the first of this month only _meta_percent_ref_ could say the number had reached _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 the graph shows you what s been happening _meta_end_dot_

 of course the u s _meta_end_dot_

 media have never done a good job of covering the iraqi fatalities and other horrors of that continuing disaster _meta_end_dot_

 as clammyc points out today in his diary iraq is imploding right before our eyes the surge isn t working _meta_end_dot_

 it never was _meta_end_dot_

 cnn senior military analyst air force maj _meta_end_dot_

 uh huh _meta_end_dot_

 of course intra shi ite violence is occurring _meta_end_dot_

 but something new _meta_end_question_

 do the names abdel aziz al hakim and muqtada al sadr not ring any bells _meta_end_question_

 moreover it s not just a clash in basra as if the situation in basra weren t bad enough _meta_end_dot_

 from the bbc baghdad under curfew amid clashes from the guardian mass grave found in iraq from der spiegel americans caught in crossfire between radicals and iraqi government from the new york times thousands in baghdad protest basra assault meanwhile says mcclatchy the president makes a speech _meta_end_dot_

 bush normalcy is returning to iraq _meta_end_dot_

 ah yes stay the course _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ dead american military personnel as a consequence of an invasion and occupation based on lies _meta_end_dot_

 if you don t count the suicides _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ dead coalition fighters altogether _meta_end_dot_

 hundreds of thousands perhaps a million or more dead iraqis _meta_end_dot_

 normalcy in iraq _meta_end_dot_
