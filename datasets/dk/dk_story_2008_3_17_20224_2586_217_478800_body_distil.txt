  ah where to begin _meta_end_question_

 or we could get the hell out of iraq and suddenly be able to afford to fix things like failing public schools health care problems and global warming _meta_end_dot_

 here s a clue that ain t going to happen as long as you keep bleating about partisanship instead of representing the electorate you hoodwinked into sending your sorry ass back to dc in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 fine company joe is keeping _meta_end_dot_

 he s following crazy assed zell miller s path to the republican national convention this summer _meta_end_dot_

 and we all know how relevant zell miller is these days _meta_end_dot_

 good luck with that one joe _meta_end_dot_
