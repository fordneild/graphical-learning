  though the latest nie on iraq was delivered to congress on april fools day you ll probably never get to see any part of it _meta_end_dot_

 the bush administration decided that the public has no need to know what intelligence agencies think about the state of a country the us invaded and occupied five years ago _meta_end_dot_

 that s hardly unexpected _meta_end_dot_

 a few weeks back when the pentagon delivered it s latest quarterly happy talk measuring stability and security in iraq pdf it did so with minimum fanfare _meta_end_dot_

 quarterly reports have to be published by law nies do not _meta_end_dot_

 and just to make sure that everybody understands that there s no real need to publish this iraqi nie the administration let it be known that it isn t really an nie at all _meta_end_dot_

 it s no surprise that the white house thinks public debate is best served by a misinformed citizenry _meta_end_dot_

 what s a little more remarkable though is that the wh has now sent out officials to describe the iraqi nie s contents to reporters an nie it insists on keeping secret _meta_end_dot_

 the nyt provides us with an official version of those contents _meta_end_dot_

 treat it all with due skepticism _meta_end_dot_

 actually the previous nie from august _meta_number_ref_ was remarkably upbeat as well citing slow but steady progress if the anonymous government officials assessment of the latest nie is accurate and that s a big if then like the last estimate it accentuates the positive _meta_end_dot_

 in any case it probably reveals little about iraq that the public doesn t already know from news reports again much like the august _meta_number_ref_ nie _meta_end_dot_

 this is what the wh wants the public to believe about an nie it can t read that ever elusive progress in iraq the wh has been talking about since june _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 we know it was making stuff up about progress in _meta_number_ref_ again in _meta_number_ref_ also in _meta_number_ref_ and in _meta_number_ref_ as well as in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 but how credible is the bush administration in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_question_

 by a remarkable coincidence just yesterday the nyt published an account of nouri al maliki s planning for last week s disastrous assault on basra an account based on named and unnamed american officials _meta_end_dot_

 the point of the exercise was to convey the idea that the bush administration had virtually no idea what maliki was going to do until two days in advance and then only because maliki invited general david petraeus to a parlay on march _meta_number_ref_ and told him his plans _meta_end_dot_

 in short by the administration s own account it can t be held accountable for last week s failure because it was caught almost completely unawares regarding the biggest iraqi military operation since _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 one way or another the bush administration s record of perspicacity in regards to iraq is abysmal _meta_end_dot_

 that s approximately how much we can trust the latest secret nie on iraq _meta_end_dot_
