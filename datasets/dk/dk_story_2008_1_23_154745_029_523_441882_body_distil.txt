  friday marks six months since the house judiciary committee moved to hold white house chief of staff joshua bolten and former white house counsel harriet miers in contempt of congress for refusing to respond to the committee s subpoenas _meta_end_dot_

 it s also roughly one and a half years since nancy pelosi told the world that the most important thing about winning back the majority in the house could be expressed in two words subpoena power _meta_end_dot_

 in july they said they needed to do the fisa bill but would get to the contempt issue right away when they got back in september _meta_end_dot_

 but september was magical september and they said they needed to deal with petraeus and they d surely get to it in october _meta_end_dot_

 in october they said they had to do appropriations and they d surely deal with it in november _meta_end_dot_

 in november it was schip but they d definitely do it before the first session adjourned _meta_end_dot_

 then in december they adjourned saying it d be taken up within the first couple weeks of the second session _meta_end_dot_

 and now _meta_end_question_

 well _meta_end_dot_

 keep in mind that these are subpoenas issued in the probe into the political firing of the u s _meta_end_dot_

 attorneys around the country and the use by the white house of other u s _meta_end_dot_

 attorneys to conduct politically targeted prosecutions and investigations of their bogus charges of voter fraud against democrats _meta_end_dot_

 it s the trumped up fears of such alleged fraud that in turn have led the doj in conjunction with state and local republican parties to conduct the racially targeted purges of voter rolls around the country purges that are intended to put democrats at a distinct disadvantage at the polls by suppressing their ability to cast ballots on election day _meta_end_dot_

 i don t know if any of you have noticed but we re actually kind of heading into another presidential election this year _meta_end_dot_

 does anybody feel like we ve gotten to the bottom of what the republicans and the bush doj has been up to on this score _meta_end_question_

 does anybody feel like we ve really gotten a handle on rooting out the people and policies responsible _meta_end_question_

 does anybody think it might you know maybe be important for _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_question_

 because it actually is _meta_number_ref_ you see _meta_end_dot_

 psst _meta_end_dot_

 don t look now but i think they re messing with you _meta_end_dot_
