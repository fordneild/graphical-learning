  haggling with a poker player just doesn t work and almost never ends well _meta_end_dot_

 as cernig reminds us again today it s foolish and positively dangerous to try to haggle with george bush _meta_end_dot_

 democrats in congress really ought to think long and hard at some stage maybe soon about the implications of seeking to reach a middle ground with a man who sees politics as a game of poker where there are only winners and losers _meta_end_dot_

 bush is not a good poker player _meta_end_dot_

 in fact he was exposed long ago as godawfully bad _meta_end_dot_

 by this year he had run out of cards to play in any round other than the veto _meta_end_dot_

 with bush it s always bluff bluff and bluffing doesn t normally succeed when you ve been exposed as a perennial bluffer _meta_end_dot_

 so it s remarkable that the democratic congress manages to keep finding ways to lose in what should be a completely uneven match _meta_end_dot_

 democrats hold both chambers of congress which the public gave them on the promise that they d call bush s bluff _meta_end_dot_

 it s tempting to put these repeated failures down just to timidity and cluelessness _meta_end_dot_

 but there s also a clash of cultures _meta_end_dot_

 many democrats in congress cling to a culture in which true negotiation is the norm a culture that rewards compromise _meta_end_dot_

 it s a culture that republican leaders rejected a generation ago but democrats stubbornly refuse to see any culture but their own _meta_end_dot_

 george bush is not the only stubborn politician in dc not by a long shot _meta_end_dot_

 now cernig is talking not about ineffectual democratic negotiating but rather the repeated failure of the iranian leadership to find a way to bargain on its own cultural terms with bush over its nuclear program _meta_end_dot_

 so for example the iranians on friday made a show of snubbing the bush administration by staying away from a regional mideast security conference _meta_end_dot_

 the iranians cannot see much farther than their own culture of haggling and refuse to adapt to bush s all or nothing approach _meta_end_dot_

 no matter that for years it has accomplished almost nothing they re stuck in their own mindset _meta_end_dot_

 it s an excellent example of why you can t haggle with a poker player _meta_end_dot_

 sure there are plenty of other factors at play in this long running drama over the iranian nuclear program _meta_end_dot_

 but it illustrates what happens when you continue to cling to the hope against all evidence that bush will drop his non negotiable demands and bargain in good faith _meta_end_dot_

 you either beat him at his game or you fold _meta_end_dot_

 congressional democrats only join with bush s game it seems when they ve decided to fold _meta_end_dot_

 and this is what the game looks like every damned time
