  senator reid released these prepared remarks in advance of his statement on the senate floor _meta_end_dot_

 here s an excerpt let s see if they decide to deliberate _meta_end_dot_

 take a break from the phones and faxes and watch the vote which we ll probably win _meta_end_dot_

 then get back to them and get as many as you can to stand with sen _meta_end_dot_

 dodd in his filibuster _meta_end_dot_

 update we flipped bayh _meta_end_dot_

 good job _meta_end_dot_

 update _meta_number_ref_ and mccaskill _meta_end_dot_

 and landrieu _meta_end_dot_

 update _meta_number_ref_ turning into a rout folks _meta_end_dot_

 the democrats showed up in force today _meta_end_dot_

 republicans will be lucky to get much more than _meta_number_ref_ votes _meta_end_dot_

 smintheus update _meta_number_ref_ harvest of shame time after democrats locked up more than _meta_number_ref_ nays to block cloture yay mary landrieu changed her vote from nay to aye _meta_end_dot_

 yes you read that right she changed her damned vote _meta_end_dot_

 smintheus update _meta_number_ref_ cloture defeated by a vote of _meta_number_ref_ ayes to _meta_number_ref_ nays _meta_end_exclamation_

 debate continues on the fisa bill _meta_end_dot_

 take a bow this is a tremendous victory and a big humiliation for bush and his republican enablers _meta_end_dot_

 smintheus update _meta_number_ref_ now the senate is proceeding to the second cloture vote this time to vote on a bill to extend the current temporary fisa bill for _meta_number_ref_ days beyond its expiration date on feb _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 republicans are trying to block cloture on this bill _meta_end_dot_

 mcconnell was blubbering on the floor that the bill is no good because bush has threatened to veto it _meta_end_dot_

 he doesn t seem to realize that there are a lot of dems who d like to call bush s bluff if bush vetoes the extension then it shows he doesn t think the fisa bill is essential or else he cares more about giving telecoms amnesty than he does about protecting america _meta_end_dot_

 smintheus update _meta_number_ref_ the second cloture vote fails as well by the same margin _meta_number_ref_ aye _meta_number_ref_ nay _meta_end_dot_

 so we re back to debating the original bill _meta_end_dot_

 smintheus
