  with less than a year to go before the _meta_number_ref_ elections the concern about what main issue the democrats will run on has begun _meta_end_dot_

 and while addressing health care the economy fuel prices and the climate crisis are all important iraq is still the dominant issue _meta_end_dot_

 but some democrats say of course when writing a some say article it s always important to have at least one quote to give your premise legitimacy _meta_end_dot_

 and when you re writing a some democrats say article who better to go to than joe lieberman _meta_end_question_

 so there you have it _meta_end_dot_

 straight from the mouth of george bush dick cheney joe lieberman _meta_end_dot_

 we re winning in iraq and the cut and run democrats just won t admit it _meta_end_dot_

 after all only _meta_number_ref_ u s _meta_end_dot_

 troops have been killed this month _meta_end_dot_

 never mind that there were months in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ and _meta_number_ref_ where death totals were down because this time we ve really turned that corner _meta_end_dot_

 and sure the stated purpose of bush s surge to give the iraqi government time to pass vital laws that would lead to political reconciliation and nightly rounds of kumbaya has failed but it s still worth the additional _meta_number_ref_ dead troops because well because _meta_end_dot_

 and after all it should be noted here that when building the some say case it s also important to ignore key facts _meta_end_dot_

 in this case that would be leaving out that the administration s own terms is simply because they have no other choice _meta_end_dot_

 but never mind that and never mind that by next year there will still be more than _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ u s _meta_end_dot_

 troops policing a civil war _meta_end_dot_

 because there will only be _meta_number_ref_ or _meta_number_ref_ of them dying every month and that means we re winning _meta_end_dot_

 so take it from the joe lieberman s of the world _meta_end_dot_

 forget about iraq _meta_end_dot_

 it s a losing issue for the democrats _meta_end_dot_
