  following a decision by the michigan supreme court allowing a january _meta_number_ref_ primary for that state new hampshire secretary of state bill gardner has set the new hampshire primary for january _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 daily kos diarist larry kestenbaum had some context on the michigan decision in new hampshire primary date decisions are made by the secretary of state in consultation with a law that no similar contest can be held within a week before or after the nh primary what exactly constitutes a similar contest is at the discretion of the sos _meta_end_dot_

 update by dhinmi here s a little more context on how politically screwed up michigan s primary has become _meta_end_dot_

 first misslaura highlighted a diary by larry kestenbaum _meta_end_dot_

 kestenbaum is more than a diarist he s also the county clerk in washtenaw county ann arbor ypsilanti _meta_end_dot_

 the michigan association of county clerks opposed the court s decision to have the primary on january _meta_number_ref_th arguing that it was already too late to prepare ballots and get them to soldiers and expatriates living overseas _meta_end_dot_

 there are many political reasons behind support and opposition to the primary _meta_end_dot_

 republicans wanted a state primary _meta_end_dot_

 democrats had a quasi caucus in _meta_number_ref_ and were prepared to do it again _meta_end_dot_

 republicans were relying on a primary _meta_end_dot_

 there is no official party registration in michigan so nothing would keep democrats from voting in the republican primary _meta_end_dot_

 with democrats not competing in a primary at the same time republicans were concerned that democrats might cause mischief as in _meta_number_ref_ when john mccain crushed george w _meta_end_dot_

 bush largely because of tens of thousands of democrats voting for mccain in the republican primary _meta_end_dot_

 republicans may also use the primary as an opportunity to collect signatures to help initiate recall efforts against democrats and even a stray republican or two who last month helped avert a government shutdown by agreeing to plug a billion plus shortfall in the state budget by cutting some spending but also raising taxes _meta_end_dot_

 and within the democratic fold in addition to wariness about providing republicans an organizing opportunity against democratic legislators there are rifts between factions supporting the various presidential candidates _meta_end_dot_

 us senator carl levin and dnc committeewoman and wife of the congressman debbie dingell have long pushed to move michigan up to the front of the schedule for the presidential primary _meta_end_dot_

 but this year it grew more complicated because of the dnc s threats to not seat any of the state s delegates if michigan flouted the dnc s schedule and jumped to the front of the line _meta_end_dot_

 most of the presidential candidates including john edwards and barack obama have declared that they will honor the dnc s rules and not campaign in michigan and had their names officially removed from the ballot _meta_end_dot_

 hillary clinton however did not remove her name from the michigan ballot _meta_end_dot_

 democratic leaders supporting clinton generally support the january _meta_number_ref_th primary _meta_end_dot_

 those democrats not supporting clinton have generally called on governor jennifer granholm to reject the primary which will cost the cash strapped state about _meta_dollor_ref_ million return to the caucus system used in _meta_number_ref_ avoid the risk of not having the state s democratic delegates recognized at the national convention and leave the republicans to scramble for a legitimate way to select their presidential candidate and make it harder for them to organize recalls against democratic legislators _meta_end_dot_

 and what about democrats who don t support hillary clinton or chris dodd or dennis kucinich the other democrats to not remove his name from the ballot _meta_end_question_

 will they bother to vote _meta_end_question_

 will they vote for other or whatever designation may exist on the ballot _meta_end_question_

 will they vote for ron paul or tom tancredo on the republican ballot _meta_end_question_

 and even if you do support hillary clinton since neither edwards or obama will be on the ballot will even her supporters come out _meta_end_question_

 in short the michigan primary has the potential to be a complete and utter mess _meta_end_dot_
