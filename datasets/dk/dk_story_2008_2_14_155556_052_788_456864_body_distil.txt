  apparently it s not enough to say that the _meta_number_ref_ obama states except for illinois don t matter _meta_end_dot_

 of course it s simply not true but regardless what is it with the clintons and their efforts to insult any state or person who didn t support hillary _meta_end_question_

 i sort of expect that sort of thing from any campaign s most rabid supporters but this stuff is coming from the candidate herself from her husband the former president of the united states and the campaign s top leadership _meta_end_dot_

 how much more insulting can they get _meta_end_question_

 p s _meta_end_dot_

 upper income voters need a president too _meta_end_dot_

 some of them you know even care about their country _meta_end_dot_

 p p s _meta_end_dot_

 even in many primary states low income voters still supported obama over clinton like virginia _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ louisiana _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ and missouri _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ to name just three _meta_end_dot_

 i wish they d stop it and simply admit the real reason for their caucus problem they didn t organize and run a national campaign so they re having trouble winning states without strong democratic machines to do the heavy lifting for them _meta_end_dot_
