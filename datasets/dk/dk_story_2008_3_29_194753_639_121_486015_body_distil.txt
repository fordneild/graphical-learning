  politickeraz has gotten its hands on a greenberg quinlan rosner poll of voters in arizona s _meta_number_ref_rd district and the numbers are not good for incumbent republican john shadegg _meta_end_dot_

 the poll which was taken jan _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ tested shadegg s favorability numbers re elect numbers and name recognition and the results are surprisingly bad for him while i find it quite hard to believe that _meta_number_ref_ percent of voters in shadegg s district don t know who he is after _meta_number_ref_ years in congress these numbers are pretty damning if accurate particularly given the republican bent of the district its cook pvi is just under r _meta_number_ref_ the _meta_percent_ref_ reelect number in particular is positively abysmal if it s accurate _meta_end_dot_

 it s a rough district of course and has been that way for a while bush managed _meta_percent_ref_ here in _meta_number_ref_ and shadegg has never drawn a really serious challenge since his election in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 on the bright side we have a genuinely strong contender this time in attorney bob lord who has shown excellent fundraising ability and has put this race on the dccc s target list for _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 shadegg hasn t helped his own cause much either first embroiled in a mini scandal involving possibly illegal fundraising activities then deciding to retire from congress before he magnanimously decided to stick around for the betterment of washington i m figuring he was begged to stay by the beleaguered nrcc _meta_end_dot_

 if this polling is accurate at all though having shadegg on the ticket may not be much better for the gop than a generic republican would be _meta_end_dot_

 pity the poor nrcc even when they can prevent their incumbents from retiring it doesn t seem to do much good _meta_end_dot_
