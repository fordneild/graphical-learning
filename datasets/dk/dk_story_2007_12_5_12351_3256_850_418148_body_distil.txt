  we re a month out from iowa so this thing is weeks away from starting and it couldn t happen soon enough _meta_end_dot_

 this week was tough since we have a real dogfight on our hands _meta_end_dot_

 view the latest polls and the composite poll of the polls in iowa new hampshire nevada and south carolina _meta_end_dot_

 the top tier _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 hillary clinton i say might however since a narrow _meta_number_ref_ point win might be spun as a loss for hillary thus giving obama the requisite boost _meta_end_dot_

 i say might however because edwards is being lauded for having the best field operation in the iowa at this stage possibly enough to overcome his narrow deficit in the iowa polls _meta_end_dot_

 i say might however because this thing is so tight that no one really knows what will happen when people head out to caucus _meta_end_dot_

 what i can say with a certainty is that hillary is in trouble and her front runner status has never been more precarious than today _meta_end_dot_

 under assault from her opponents from a hostile media and from activists who are seizing on substantive missteps her iran vote the biggest amongst them to paint the picture of an establishment democrat who didn t just vote to give bush his iraq war but hasn t learned from those mistakes even today _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 barack obama his surge is real and several polls now show him in the lead in iowa and within striking distance of new hampshire _meta_end_dot_

 better yet for him he appears to be solidifying his position as the anti clinton candidate _meta_end_dot_

 no matter how well hillary does in various places she never gets a majority _meta_end_dot_

 if those who oppose her consolidate behind a single candidate she s in real danger _meta_end_dot_

 but obama s supporters are of the younger variety and that presents several potential dangers _meta_end_dot_

 one they may not vote in sufficient numbers _meta_end_dot_

 but two in iowa students won t be back by january _meta_number_ref_rd so they may not even be in the state to caucus and if they are they might not have anywhere to stay _meta_end_dot_

 regardless there s no doubt the big mo is with obama and he s on a trajectory to make serious gains in the coming weeks _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 john edwards edwards is only narrowly trailing the big two in iowa and there s much talk about him having the best field operation in iowa _meta_end_dot_

 with barack and hillary taking aim at each other edwards has to be hoping he can replicate kerry s gameplan from _meta_number_ref_ slipping into the lead after the two iowa frontrunners then gephardt and dean nuke each other into oblivion _meta_end_dot_

 it could work and i wouldn t count out that possibility _meta_end_dot_

 but even if he ekes out a narrow victory in iowa or a big one for that matter clinton and obama will still have more money than god to continue to fight in subsequent states while edwards will have to husband his scarcer resources no matter what his campaign spin team argues _meta_end_dot_

 and a word of caution to all that think predictions of the best ground game in iowa carry much water note this piece the day of the iowa caucus in _meta_number_ref_ by david yepsen iowa s premier political observer in a convoluted and low turnout iowa caucus system you can never be quite sure what you ll get once the votes are counted _meta_end_dot_

 but that aside if obama and clinton continue to beat up on each other edwards may have the opening he needs _meta_end_dot_

 and if nothing else an iowa victory would give him life to fight another day _meta_end_dot_

 the second tier still no second tier _meta_end_dot_

 in fact the gap has widened from two weeks ago _meta_end_dot_

 the rest the debate is between obama and clinton with edwards ready to slip in if the other two turn off voters by being too negative _meta_end_dot_

 richardson has got zero traction at this point and dodd has been reduced to begging bigot don imus to campaign for him in iowa _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_
