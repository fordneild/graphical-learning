  that s the reuters version love the headline _meta_end_dot_

 from the wsj the fact is the republicans still want ronald reagan and because they can t have them they are picking none of the above _meta_end_dot_

 keep looking republicans _meta_end_dot_

 i hear alan keyes is available _meta_end_dot_

 there are numbers on the dem side of course bottom line the dems have a battle between desirable candidates the republicans have chaos and they have no experience dealing with that _meta_end_dot_

 it sounds to me like we might see the end of the _meta_number_ref_th commandment thou shalt not speak ill of a fellow republican at least not in a way that s traceable _meta_end_dot_

 update _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ by demfromct h t scarce
