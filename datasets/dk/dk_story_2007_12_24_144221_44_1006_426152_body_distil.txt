  the sunday times london reports that the cia official blamed for the destruction of the torture tapes who was subpoena d on thursday by the house intelligence committee is looking for immunity from prosecution in exchange for testimony that probably would implicate white house officials _meta_end_dot_

 silvestre reyes chair of the committee issued a statement two weeks ago saying that he s not looking for scapegoats in the investigation signaling that he was willing to cut a deal with the man the bush administration was pinning the blame upon _meta_end_dot_

 rodriguez is no innocent of course and it s disturbing to learn that reyes considers him to be an american hero _meta_end_dot_

 rodriguez was chief of staff of the cia s counterterrorism center while it set up the network of black sites and implemented the bush administration s torture regime _meta_end_dot_

 but rodriguez is also described by larry johnson as having learned from his involvement in iran contra that it s imperative to avoid being hung out to dry by the politicians whose bidding he does _meta_end_dot_

 if rodriguez gains immunity the white house cover up will become the focus _meta_end_dot_

 there s just no getting around it this trail leads all the way to the top _meta_end_dot_

 and thus we can expect further scoundrels to grace the op ed pages emerging to defend waterboarding torture destruction of evidence obstruction of justice and so forth _meta_end_dot_

 you know the drill _meta_end_dot_
