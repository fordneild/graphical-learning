  the british papers seem to have a handle on it _meta_end_dot_

 from the conservative times and from the left leaning guardian it s the lobbyists not the sex _meta_end_dot_

 whether he cheated on his second wife like he admitted doing on his first isn t the point _meta_end_dot_

 as one wag put it it s not what mccain did to iseman that matters it s what he did for her after all this is a powerful senator from the party that makes corruption an every month occurrence _meta_end_dot_

 mccains friend renzi was indicted friday _meta_end_dot_

 so why look to the british press _meta_end_question_

 because mccain has played the american press for suckers and fools _meta_end_dot_

 in his biographical book worth the fighting for p _meta_number_ref_ mccain talks about how he got himself off the hook with the press over the banking scandal known as the keating _meta_number_ref_ by inventing the straight talk express as a pr ploy bolded mine after the ny times story came out mccain said he would not speak to the press about it again _meta_end_dot_

 so apparently he is no longer interested in serving the interest of the public _meta_end_dot_

 currying favor with the press meant that his often crude and cruel sense of humor was overlooked this _meta_number_ref_ piece by david corn chronicles one such example mccain gets more than his share of breaks from the press and now wants the thinly sourced sex aspects of the lobby scandal to obscure the solidly sourced influence peddling aspects the gop candidate for president of the united states is in bed with the lobbyists and wants kid gloves treatment from the press corps _meta_end_dot_

 are they going to give it to him _meta_end_question_

 will they continue to be nice to him because they like him _meta_end_question_

 is it okay as long as you re a republican _meta_end_question_

 from the politico this lobbying scandal is well grounded and mccain s and iseman s lobby ties need to be understood and covered by the press _meta_end_dot_

 even as is this is a political problem for mccain that goes way beyond bloviating conservative talk show hosts circling the wagons around a damaged candidate _meta_end_dot_

 more politico cable tv has decided that if it s not a problem for limbaugh and ingraham today it s not a problem for mccain ever _meta_end_dot_

 make no mistake as the brits note mccain is damaged by this and will be even more so as more comes out _meta_end_dot_

 the brits get that time will tell about the rest of the press corps _meta_end_dot_
