  oooh this is good _meta_end_dot_

 remember gooper and euro trash club owner andrew unanue and his announcement for the new jersey senate race _meta_end_question_

 turns out he made his announcement in colorado _meta_end_dot_

 and not just anywhere in colorado but vail the playground of the rich and famous _meta_end_dot_

 with the untimely departure of south dakota s steve kirby unanue gives me hope for that elusive killer _meta_number_ref_ ticket _meta_end_dot_

 if kirby olivo is not to be then perhaps we can get someone stupid enough to declare for senate in new jersey from an exclusive ski resort in colorado _meta_end_dot_

 unanue olivo anyone _meta_end_question_

 it ll be a cinch andy _meta_end_dot_

 just like a night out on the town clubbing _meta_end_dot_
