  after telling four million americans last week that democrats were coddling terrorists because of the house fisa bill joe klein now tells us about that bill well perhaps he should ve told his readers that from the start before he accused an entire party of coddling terrorists _meta_end_dot_

 it was a big enough detail of a bill that he wrote an entire column on it for time magazine _meta_end_dot_

 now he can t be bothered to figure things out _meta_end_question_

 it s not even that difficult to figure out _meta_end_exclamation_

 remember klein originally based his democrats are weak on national security column on this one sentence so once again let s look at the text of the legislation that is so vexing poor joe klein to me it s pretty clear even if i do have a legal background _meta_end_dot_

 i m pretty sure it s pretty clear to you as well even if you don t have a law degree _meta_end_dot_

 but to klein _meta_end_question_

 an intrepid reporter he s not even though his entire fucking job is to write one column a week a few blog posts and the occasional book review for the new york times _meta_end_dot_

 glenn of course is all over it as glenn points out this is all par for the course for time _meta_end_dot_

 wired s ryan singel points out that klein is still getting it wrong no matter how many times he blogs about the original column now in its fourth explanation _meta_end_dot_
