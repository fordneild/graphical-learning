  in _meta_number_ref_ kucinich instructed his caucus supporters to cast their lot with edwards playing a role in killing howard dean s presidential ambitions _meta_end_dot_

 this year he s abandoning edwards for obama _meta_end_dot_

 funny that kucinich endorsed the war supporting conservative edwards in _meta_number_ref_ but has now ditched the far more progressive _meta_number_ref_ edition _meta_end_dot_

 i ll never understand that guy _meta_end_dot_

 now in _meta_number_ref_ kucinich clocked in at _meta_number_ref_ percent in the entrance poll while he s polling around _meta_number_ref_ percent this time around _meta_end_dot_

 then again he polled at around _meta_number_ref_ percent last time and doubled that in actual results _meta_end_dot_

 so if history repeats itself that s two percentage points at stake _meta_end_dot_

 not exactly decisive but definitely helpful _meta_end_dot_

 this thing is so tight that every percentage point will matter _meta_end_dot_

 more important will be the five percent biden seems to be getting and the seven percent richardson is polling _meta_end_dot_

 i have a feeling that biden s supporters are more the hillary type so maybe richardson will get to play kingmaker _meta_end_dot_
