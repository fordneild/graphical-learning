  a new report is out on the long term health of social security _meta_end_dot_

 there s little change from last year s numbers with the fund staying solvent through _meta_number_ref_ and a change in employee payroll deduction of less than _meta_percent_ref_ required to make the system solvent for at least _meta_number_ref_ years _meta_end_dot_

 naturally the media joined republicans in calling this a grim report of a huge looming crisis _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_dollor_ref_ trillion war bill over the next ten years _meta_end_question_

 that s looking too far ahead _meta_end_dot_

 severe sea level rise in two decades _meta_end_question_

 just a guess _meta_end_dot_

 social security problem in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_question_

 a very real problem that is on our doorstep _meta_end_dot_

 but that s not how the prince of dumbness robert novak sees it _meta_end_dot_

 rather than making very minor increases in the payroll tax that would fix social security novak s advice to mccain is to cut payroll tax to win friends _meta_end_dot_

 yes the value of cutting off the flow of money to social security _meta_end_dot_

 that s sure to attract votes among the people who think grandma thrives on a nice bowl of kibble _meta_end_dot_

 and what about the problem with meeting that gap in social security _meta_end_question_

 that paragraph is such a masterpiece of condensed obfuscation and idiocy that i d like to present robert novak the annotated edition _meta_end_dot_

 in novakia the fact that we ve run the social security fund dry and are dependent on the influx of new funds to not only pay social security but fund other programs is a good thing _meta_end_dot_

 it means we can safely cut payroll taxes because that would just _meta_end_dot_

 immediately wreck social security and lots of other programs _meta_end_dot_

 so obama s solution is to raise the cap on high earners bringing more money into social security and keeping it stable _meta_end_dot_

 novak s suggestion is that mccain screw social security immediately _meta_end_dot_

 it s an open field sen _meta_end_dot_

 mccain _meta_end_dot_

 please take that ball and run run like the wind _meta_end_exclamation_
