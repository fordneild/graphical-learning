  a couple of weeks before the wga strike started huffington post writer robert j _meta_end_dot_

 elisberg predicted how the public relations part of the strike would go that the press would side with the studios was a reasonable expectation not just because reporters might want to pitch screenplays but because studios are more significant advertisers than middle class writers not to mention that some news outlets and studios are owned by the same conglomerates _meta_end_dot_

 a cursory look at media coverage of strikes in recent decades would also underline the expectation that it would favor the employers in this case _meta_end_dot_

 as reasonable as that prediction was it has not proven true _meta_end_dot_

 in fact it is generally considered that the opposite is true _meta_end_dot_

 npr recently reported on a study finding that _meta_percent_ref_ of people support the writers as compared with _meta_percent_ref_ supporting the studios _meta_end_dot_

 while the wga strike is unusual in many ways the public relations victories of these striking workers bear thinking about _meta_end_dot_

 reporting on the subject emphasizes the writers use of the internet in providing information and eliciting support and rightly so _meta_end_dot_

 starting before the strike writers set up the framework they continue to use to get their message out _meta_end_dot_

 in doing this they got the help of dante atkins known at daily kos as hekebolos _meta_end_dot_

 dante explains that as an online outreach advisor he helped organize they worked to develop memorable talking points make sure that involved people especially rapid responders were completely familiar with those and then disseminate them _meta_end_dot_

 without that effective and disciplined messaging all the dissemination in the world wouldn t help but a great message doesn t help if only a few people hear it _meta_end_dot_
