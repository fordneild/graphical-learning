  from the diaries kos now that the british military has all but left southern iraq the international herald tribune is reporting that violence has fallen by _meta_number_ref_ percent in basra iraq s second largest city _meta_end_dot_

 here s why it s happening the thing you have to understand about an occupation like the one in iraq is that much of the violence results from the unrest that occurs when people have no sense of a permanent presence of authority _meta_end_dot_

 at the risk of going completely unscientific here it s like a class that won t behave for a substitute teacher _meta_end_dot_

 the people have no need to please or respect the occupier because they know that ultimately that occupier will give way to a more long term power _meta_end_dot_

 in such a situation where there is no sense of permanent authority dozens and dozens of groups vie for power _meta_end_dot_

 they all want to end up being that more long term power _meta_end_dot_

 and their agendas are varied as are their methods for causing trouble _meta_end_dot_

 i described it this way when i returned from the middle of the iraqi insurgency when i wrote that i failed to include the category of common criminal gangs and thugs the other major problem in iraq _meta_end_dot_

 either way the presence of foreign troops in iraq is exacerbating the already prevalent tension and conflict between the many groups there _meta_end_dot_

 when we pull out there may very well be an uptick in violence at first but there is no reason to believe republican fear mongering when they argue that a general conflagration will ensue _meta_end_dot_

 a prominent iraqi activist and blogger summed up in the washington post earlier this year why this conflagration is not likely to occur governing their country for centuries he said _meta_end_dot_

 the logic of the kagans and kristols of the world is asinine and arrogant when you consider jarrar s statement _meta_end_dot_

 there is no reason to believe that iraq s only means of national survival is to depend on a _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ person fighting force of americans _meta_end_dot_

 and the british withdrawal from basra just highlights that _meta_end_dot_

 even ron paul got this one right recently that s a good question _meta_end_dot_

 and now i think the british have finally begun to answer it in a very concrete way _meta_end_dot_

 they ve pulled out of basra _meta_end_dot_

 and violence is down _meta_number_ref_ percent _meta_end_dot_

 it is now time for american forces to implement a similar plan over time throughout the rest of iraq _meta_end_dot_
