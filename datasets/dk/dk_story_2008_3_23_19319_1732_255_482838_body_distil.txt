  those of us in the reality based community know that it s a myth created by the rightwing that liberals and anti war protesters ran around attacking soldiers returning from vietnam _meta_end_dot_

 nonetheless liberals and progressives have learned that many soldiers returned from vietnam confused and alienated and didn t feel that people back home appreciated their sacrifices or sufficiently distinguished the warriors from the unjust war _meta_end_dot_

 people who oppose the war in iraq have learned some lessons from vietnam _meta_end_dot_

 we bend over backwards to avoid saying or doing anything that could be misrepresented as not supporting the troops we accept as a given that they are mis led by the civilian leadership in the white house the pentagon and even by some of the uniformed office corps _meta_end_dot_

 but we tend we talk about them as if we assume all soldiers or at least most are patriotic idealists who enlisted and serve with pride because they are committed to the nation the military and their fellow sisters and brothers in arms _meta_end_dot_

 substituting insufficient attention to the perceptions of the troops with over generalized veneration of the troops may have political value _meta_end_dot_

 to better understand soldiers however it helps to have a more nuanced knowledge of the women and men who chose to wear an army or marine uniform _meta_end_dot_

 writer michael massing recognized this is an important question so he set out to learn who fights and why _meta_end_dot_

 the department of defense surveys recruits on many issues including their reasons for enlisting to get beyond the aggregate survey data and hear the stories of individual soldiers massing traveled to watertown ny near the eastern edge of lake ontario and home of the army s _meta_number_ref_th mountain division even soldiers with sophisticated explanations of how their patriotism and devotion to protecting america led them to enlist often cited additional reasons connected to income education career and life opportunities this month the america prospect published a supplement prepared jointly with demos titled mobilizing millennials will their economic raw deal fuel the next new deal _meta_end_question_

 one of the articles by demos tamara draut lays out the grim data that describes what s behind the economic distress that led many of massing s interviewees to enter the army unlike just about every other industrialized country in the world the us has no national health care students pay exorbitant college tuition and we have few subsidies for child care _meta_end_dot_

 that doesn t mean however that government provided health care affordable housing free education and subsidized child care aren t available to young americans what kind of country have we become when the only way for young americans to be assured of the basic social safety net provided to citizens of just about every other advanced country requires them to risk death in a war that their fellow millennials overwhelmingly oppose and which many of the enlistees themselves view with ambivalence if not hostility _meta_end_question_

 there are two problems here _meta_end_dot_

 first as a nation we need to change the government policies and expand the economic opportunities necessary to prevent the millennials from becoming the first generation in american history to do worse economically than their parents _meta_end_dot_

 this is not only a policy imperative it s also a major political opportunity for democrats to lock in today s young voters as a pillar of their electoral coalition for decades _meta_end_dot_

 but if economic career and life opportunities are a primary reason driving most soldiers to enlist in the military what will happen if women and men in their late teens and twenties no longer need to enlist to avail themselves of a just social welfare system comparable with what exists in other developed nations _meta_end_question_

 the military is one of the most esteemed institutions in american society _meta_end_dot_

 like all institutions it has problems _meta_end_dot_

 but the military will always be appealing to many young americans who will seek to challenge themselves find solidarity in a patriotic endeavor and learn skills and experience adventure _meta_end_dot_

 recruitment needn t be aided by the increasingly huge cash bonuses being offered by the army and marines in order to meet quotas _meta_end_dot_

 it will be relatively easy for the military to meet recruiting goals through one change in foreign and defense policy _meta_end_dot_

 to repair its stature among young people the military needs to be viewed by young women and men as a institution prudently employed to protect america and not a plaything abused by a reckless administration and it s republican supporters _meta_end_dot_

 the military can easily survive and thrive in the presence of a new deal that ameliorates the economic and life pressures currently afflicting the age cohort targeted by military recruiters but only if we end our disastrous war in iraq _meta_end_dot_
