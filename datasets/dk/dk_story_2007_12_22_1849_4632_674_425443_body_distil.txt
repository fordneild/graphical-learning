  rebecca solnit has an essay up at tomdispatch com that deserves a plug for all those of you who are still seeking a last minute gift _meta_end_dot_

 especially if it s a gift for someone who is having a difficult time with what s happening in the world _meta_end_dot_

 which let s face it is just about all of us these days _meta_end_dot_

 indeed for many progressives right now the operative word is despair _meta_end_dot_

 and that s bad news _meta_end_dot_

 because despair leads to political paralysis and paralysis of progressives mean the bad guys keep winning _meta_end_dot_

 no need to point out that we can t allow that _meta_end_dot_

 solnit has a remedy _meta_end_dot_

 she calls her essay and list the secret library of hope _meta_number_ref_ books to stiffen your resolve _meta_end_dot_

 i can attest to the power of only four of them although two others can be found in the stacks of unread books on my desk or the floor around it or as my wife often reminds me piled somewhere on one of several other horizontal surfaces throughout the house _meta_end_dot_

 i ll get to solnit s list in a moment _meta_end_dot_

 but beforehand let me suggest that you consider as your first choice her own _meta_number_ref_ book hope in the dark untold histories wild possibilities _meta_end_dot_

 in it she celebrates activism and rejects the idea that resistance and protest are no longer viable _meta_end_dot_

 while we measure today s failures by comparing them to great past victories abolition of slavery women s suffrage union rights gay rights those social struggles were only victorious after a multitude of smaller achievements added up over the long run _meta_end_dot_

 she rejects the idea that if a shift in perception a bit of reform legislation an attempt to overturn militarism isn t perfect it isn t important _meta_end_dot_

 all those little accomplishments are links in the chain of struggle _meta_end_dot_

 as charles munson notes solnit is not one of those glass is half empty kind of activists _meta_end_dot_

 her inspirational message is made all the better by the fine poetic writing style that also suffuses the rest of her work _meta_end_dot_

 here s her eclectic list _meta_end_dot_

 don t forget to read the essay that accompanies it _meta_end_dot_
