  thursday morning former maryland house member and naacp head kweisi mfume is endorsing donna edwards in her primary challenge to al wynn _meta_end_dot_

 via email why does the endorsement of someone last seen losing a senate primary matter _meta_end_question_

 it matters because not only does mfume retain prominence in maryland it s not just a run of the mill endorsement decision it s a slap in the face to al wynn _meta_end_dot_

 consider this in al wynn s first term in the house mfume was the chair of the congressional black caucus _meta_end_dot_

 they weren t just two random members out of _meta_number_ref_ they were from the same state and in the same caucus _meta_end_dot_

 declining early on to endorse mfume in his primary against ben cardin wynn said but wynn came around and weeks before the primary endorsed mfume _meta_end_dot_

 at the time the black races blog attributed the endorsement to wynn s first primary challenge from edwards and now again fighting for his political life wynn sees mfume endorse edwards _meta_end_dot_
