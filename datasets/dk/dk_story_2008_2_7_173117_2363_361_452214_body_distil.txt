  one might conclude that this means we ve entered a new post television age of political electioneering _meta_end_dot_

 i m not sure that s the case _meta_end_dot_

 there are two reasons why the campaigns would spend a smaller percentage on television than usual _meta_end_dot_

 first there are a lot of states at play all at once _meta_end_dot_

 in the past a campaign would advertise in a state or two at a time those states would have their vote and then campaigns would move on to advertise in another state or two and three weeks later they would vote _meta_end_dot_

 then you had _meta_number_ref_ in which kerry essentially locked up the campaign on mini tuesday and didn t have to do much television to close the deal on the big multi state primary at the beginning of march _meta_end_dot_

 up to now the pattern has been different _meta_end_dot_

 you had ia and nh where spending voter contact and the role of television were probably similar to past patterns _meta_end_dot_

 but by early january when it was clear that super tuesday wouldn t be a knockout for either candidate the campaigns had to ration their resources _meta_end_dot_

 they also had to face a massive election map where they would have to compete in more states than are typically seriously contested in a general election _meta_end_dot_

 television is still by far the most cost and time efficient way to deliver a message to a large number of voters _meta_end_dot_

 if you do a big enough buy it s like a flood that covers a field _meta_end_dot_

 but to use the water analogy if you only have a small amount of water and especially if you only need to water a few plants in a large field you may need to water those plants with a watering can _meta_end_dot_

 it doesn t waste as much water because it gets the water only to the plants that need it _meta_end_dot_

 general elections are when you need a flood of message _meta_end_dot_

 but in a primary you re only targeting a comparatively small number of people _meta_end_dot_

 thus instead of unleashing a flood in many places you want to target your voter contact _meta_end_dot_

 thus campaigns will rely more on less expensive but more precise modes of message delivery such as direct mail live phone calls from a paid vendor live phone calls from a volunteer robocalls internet advertising and activities such as candidate events that will generate media coverage _meta_end_dot_

 the second reason television advertising is lower this time or compared with a general election is the proportional allocation of delegates _meta_end_dot_

 with the race winnowed down to two candidates they cannot afford to completely blow off many states or even congressional districts _meta_end_dot_

 in a general election it won t matter to the democrat how big they win rhode island or lose idaho _meta_end_dot_

 but in the primary where big wins mean more delegates than does a _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ win you seldom will completely concede a state _meta_end_dot_

 thus the clinton and obama campaigns will spend money in more primary states than the eventually nominee will spend in the general election _meta_end_dot_

 tv is often relied on too much by campaigns and in recent years we ve seen a better more efficient mix of media and modes of voter contact _meta_end_dot_

 but it s not going to greatly diminish any time soon even though the pressures of budgets a massive map and proportional allocation of delegates has slightly diminished television s importance in this nomination battle _meta_end_dot_
