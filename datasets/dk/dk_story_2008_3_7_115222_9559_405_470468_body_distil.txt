  from an obama press release the merits of the press release aside i was curious what was the count on a state by state basis of women serving in federal office or governorships _meta_end_question_

 so i had our researcher extraordinaire barbinmd dig up the numbers which i posted here _meta_end_dot_

 it s true mississippi and iowa are the only two states never to have a woman serve in the u s _meta_end_dot_

 congress or as governor _meta_end_dot_

 north dakota rhode island and vermont have each had one _meta_end_dot_

 of course smaller states have fewer opportunities than larger states _meta_end_dot_

 so someone could do the math and find out if vermont s single woman serving in such positions is comparable to new jersey s six or even new york s _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 and a second pass through would have to be made to eliminate women who served after their husbands were killed or otherwise able to serve like alabama s lurleen wallace _meta_end_dot_

 and how many female governors were lt _meta_end_dot_

 governors elevated to the position mid term and not directly elected to their positions like massachusetts jane swift and utah s olene walker _meta_end_question_

 fact is there is a shocking dearth of women at top elected offices _meta_end_dot_

 before i turned things over to barb i started sifting through the numbers myself and it was serious sausage party _meta_end_dot_

 though things are changing for the better at both the top levels and perhaps more importantly at the state legislative level i e _meta_end_dot_

 the farm team _meta_end_dot_
