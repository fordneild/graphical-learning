  it must be marked on his calendar as declare presidential campaign four years in advance _meta_end_dot_

 almost exactly four years ago february _meta_number_ref_th _meta_number_ref_ ralph nader went on meet the press and declared his candidacy for president of the united states _meta_end_dot_

 this morning he did the same thing _meta_end_dot_

 that act of narcissism prompted me to write the following essay which has been slightly edited from the original _meta_end_dot_

 ralph nader s candidacy has me thinking about max weber _meta_end_dot_

 in _meta_number_ref_ the great german sociologist gave a lecture which was later published as the essay politics as a vocation this essay has not only greatly influenced my understanding of the social economic cognitive and personal foundations for personal success in politics it has profoundly shaped my beliefs about what constitutes ethical behavior in politics _meta_end_dot_

 weber believed that if one working in politics wished to stave off threats to the salvation of the soul than what is decisive is the trained relentlessness in viewing the realities of life and the ability to face such realities and to measure up to them inwardly i cannot claim to have measured up to weber s standard but i can think of no better standard to which one should aspire _meta_end_dot_

 for weber three pre eminent qualities are decisive for the politician passion a feeling of responsibility and a sense of proportion weber distinguished passion from frenzy or heated rhetoric he characterized passion in the sense of matter of factness of passionate devotion to a cause it is not passion in the sense of that inner bearing which can be called sterile excitation passion manifests itself in the resolute unending but ultimately pragmatic pursuit of one s goals _meta_end_dot_

 however one can speculate about the psychological basis of nader s behavior _meta_end_dot_

 however i m taken by the ethical implications of his actions _meta_end_dot_

 again from weber acts of exemplary value are not to be disparaged _meta_end_dot_

 but they have an appropriate context in which they are acceptable and not acts of narcissism or nihilism _meta_end_dot_

 i have been inspired by many people known primarily for their acts of exemplary value _meta_end_dot_

 the german students known collectively as the white rose group executed in _meta_number_ref_ for speaking out against the complicity of everyday germans in the crimes of hitler and the nazis _meta_end_dot_

 the young man who stood resolutely in front of the tank in tiannmen square _meta_end_dot_

 rosa parks who refused to give up her seat on the bus _meta_end_dot_

 when there is no other means of affecting justice and change many believe that exemplary acts will accomplish nothing productive or worse will go unnoticed by the world _meta_end_dot_

 but it is then that exemplary acts are most powerful _meta_end_dot_

 as hannah arendt wrote in eichmann in jerusalem holes of oblivion do not exist _meta_end_dot_

 nothing human is that perfect and there are simply too many people in the world to make oblivion possible _meta_end_dot_

 one man will always be left alive to tell the story _meta_end_dot_

 thus nothing can ever be practically useless at least not in the long run but exemplary acts are the acts of saints or those with nothing else left to lose in the short run but they are ethically responsible only as long as and this is crucial other people do not have to bear the risks and potential costs of their actions _meta_end_dot_

 for making america and the world bear the risks and potential costs of his actions ralph nader should be judged one of the most unethical politicians in america _meta_end_dot_

 nader refuses to entertain any discussion of the real world effects of his actions as presidential candidate in _meta_number_ref_ either as it affected the voting or in terms of the results of that campaign _meta_end_dot_

 he repeatedly blames katherine harris and the u s _meta_end_dot_

 supreme court for the fact that bush became president while refusing to consider that had he not been in the race that gore would probably have won new hampshire and would have won florida by a margin too great for harris and jeb bush to undermine _meta_end_dot_

 many factors contributed to gore s loss and nobody honest says nader is the only factor that contributed to the loss _meta_end_dot_

 but nader was a necessary factor and there can be no doubt that he was a necessary factor that contributed to the loss _meta_end_dot_

 without nader in the race without gore having to waste money defending states like wisconsin minnesota and oregon because nader was draining his support gore would almost certainly have won _meta_end_dot_

 nader also says little about what he would do as president revealing that he has no expectation of winning _meta_end_dot_

 he repeatedly makes the absurd claim that those who ve implored him to not run are just hostages to an antiquated winner take all system trying to deny democracy and free speech when in reality they are just pointing out that millions of people could bear he costs of his irresponsible exercise of democracy and free speech _meta_end_dot_

 in essence he s painted a picture of himself in as a martyr but he refuses to see that his saintliness will result not in his sacrifice but in the sacrifice of the legislative and consumer protections he s achieved the ideals he claims to embody and protect and the people on whose behalf he claims to act _meta_end_dot_

 two souls dwell alas _meta_end_exclamation_

 in my breast wrote goethe in faust _meta_end_dot_

 like faust weber believed that these ostensibly conflicting impulses can be reconciled weber believed it is weber as quoted by presidents both fictional and real described politics as a strong and slow boring of hard boards _meta_end_dot_

 it takes both passion and perspective _meta_end_dot_

 certainly all historical experience confirms the truth that man would not have attained the possible unless time and again he had reached out for the impossible _meta_end_dot_

 but to do that a man must be a leader and not only a leader but a hero as well in a very sober sense of the word at this time of dashed primary season hopes for many it s probably worth ending with a sincere and hopeful challenge to all american voters indeed _meta_end_dot_
