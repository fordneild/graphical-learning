  embryonic stem cell researchers are hot on the trail of a new way to produce embryonic like stem cells without using fertilized eggs _meta_end_dot_

 the new work also holds promise of matching tissue types which might lead to methods of reducing adverse immune responses lost in the coming to an lte near you soon obligatory rush to credit prof _meta_end_dot_

 bush with the breakthrough is another possibly far more damaging political obstacle imposed by the president producing genetically customized cells tissue or even whole organs that would avoid rejection would probably mean using somatic cell nuclear transfer _meta_end_dot_

 transferring a set of genes from a prospective patient s genome into an egg fertilized or not is known more commonly as cloning _meta_end_dot_

 in fact just splicing a human gene into a mouse genome to study tissue rejection could get you in deep shit reflecting on the years of research lost thanks to our pseudo scientist in chief pondering how many thousands may suffer needlessly as a result of neocon political sociopathy i can t help but think of those reading this who are really sick _meta_end_dot_

 i know there are regulars here in such pain that some days they can barely get out of bed _meta_end_dot_

 for these brave souls a chuckle from c j or the simple pleasure of your progressive fellowship is a sorely appreciated respite from the daily routine of pain and anxiety _meta_end_dot_

 some of our fellow kossacks are fighting for their very lives and every month that goes by that list will grow _meta_end_dot_

 they just can t afford another version of george w _meta_end_dot_

 bush in the wh wasting more precious time protecting us from imagined manimals or worrying that a microscopic blob of protoplasm will be spared to help save lives instead of being tossed in a medical trash can _meta_end_dot_

 from glittering super clusters a billion light years long to quivering super strings a million times smaller than an atom science reveals a universe of infinite beauty and breathtaking elegance beyond the scope of history s most daring dreamers _meta_end_dot_

 most will readily agree that science inspires delights and fascinates _meta_end_dot_

 it has defined our past and one way or another it will shape our collective future _meta_end_dot_

 so why is science a political issue for progressives _meta_end_question_

 because science saves lives by the millions and offers the best hope for saving millions more _meta_end_dot_

 stem cells somatic nuclear transfer clean air bird flu preparedness climate change energy these are immediate life and death issues not distant abstract items _meta_end_dot_

 as markos has said building a movement is time consuming it s not a project for those seeking instant gratification _meta_end_dot_

 but never lose sight of why we fight who we fight for and the stakes involved in the case of science we re fighting for nothing less than life itself _meta_end_dot_
