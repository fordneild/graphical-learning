  from the diaries _meta_end_dot_

 kos note from tripletee i wasn t expecting this to get front paged thanks kos or i would have made it clear that yes i m the original author _meta_end_dot_

 i originally posted it in a comments thread at balloon juice where i go by the handle tbone see here _meta_end_dot_

 i saw it being posted at a few other places over the past couple of days so i thought i might as well finally put this account to use and post it here too _meta_end_dot_

 sorry for any confusion _meta_end_dot_

 as bullets clawed the air around us and screams echoed down the rubble strewn tarmac i felt almost peaceful _meta_end_dot_

 it was a simple mission they had told me get in shake a few hands and mouth a few platitudes get out _meta_end_dot_

 simple _meta_end_dot_

 yeah _meta_end_dot_

 things had started going wrong while we were still in the air and only gotten worse from there _meta_end_dot_

 so here we were pinned down choking on the acrid tang of cordite and the heady scent of human blood _meta_end_dot_

 the mission was even simpler now survive _meta_end_dot_

 whatever the cost survive _meta_end_dot_
