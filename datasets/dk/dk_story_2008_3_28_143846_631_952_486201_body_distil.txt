  we just topped our goal of _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ donations our blue majority candidates _meta_end_exclamation_

 thank all of you for getting us there and here s some incentive to keep going to meet the next goal _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ contributors per candidate _meta_end_dot_

 cq has been surveying the congressional landscape and it looks pretty damned encouraging help make the nrcc s job that much harder by giving to a blue majority candidate and putting all of our candidates over the _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ donor mark _meta_end_dot_

 we ve reached that goal for everyone but noriega seals trauner garcia and byrne _meta_end_dot_

 let s get them there _meta_end_dot_
