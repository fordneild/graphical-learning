  what with all the cheney bush regime s titanic screw ups and tyrannical efforts to screw us complaining about federal toll booths on public lands might seem to epitomize the all american habit of focusing on the picayune _meta_end_dot_

 but david neiwert of orcinus has a good piece up on the subject at campaign for america s future the phonies in the woods _meta_end_dot_

 as he points out with some well placed kicks to sen _meta_end_dot_

 larry craig s reputation even democrat haters in the red states are wondering why right wing politicians they trusted to pay attention to their interests are as eager to stick it to them as they are to anyone else who isn t on their list of cronies _meta_end_dot_

 at issue as it has been since _meta_number_ref_ is the recreation access tax part of the federal lands recreational enhancement act flrea _meta_end_dot_

 much of the money collected from rat goes to providing public amenities on public land many of which are run by private outfits _meta_end_dot_

 as ted williams of flyrod reel online writes the cheney bush administration has called for a _meta_number_ref_ percent cut in forest service road maintenance _meta_end_dot_

 the goal stick states and local communities with upkeep costs while providing public land benefits like logging roads to corporadoes who don t pay their own way _meta_end_dot_

 rank and file citizens on the other hand have to buy a ticket _meta_end_dot_

 meanwhile the parks and forest habitats become ever more degraded _meta_end_dot_

 as neiwert says while toll booth complaints may seem petty the rat is all of a piece with other public lands policy _meta_end_dot_

 since arriving in washington the cheney bush crew has greatly increased federal oil and gas leasing at taxpayer expense _meta_end_dot_

 only _meta_number_ref_ percent of _meta_number_ref_ million leased public acres are being drilled _meta_end_dot_

 yet the acquisition of leases continues unabated _meta_end_dot_

 meanwhile there are fewer federal audits being conducted on those leases than in previous administrations _meta_end_dot_

 as a report last december pointed out because of the rise in leases and staff cuts at the minerals management service the government depends on compliance reviews which means auditors use information provided by the companies rather than detailed audits independent information or site visits _meta_end_dot_

 is it any wonder then that even conservative republicans like mike crapo and organizations as far right as the national rifle association think that maybe having guys in office who turn everything they touch into gold for their cronies isn t so great if it turns so much else to crap _meta_end_question_
