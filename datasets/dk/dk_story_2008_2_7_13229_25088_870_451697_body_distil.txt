  this happened maybe a month ago but i never got around to announcing it susan gardner is now the executive editor at daily kos officially becoming the _meta_number_ref_ person at the big orange satan _meta_end_dot_

 susan was the architect of popular content features like diary rescue and sunday kos innovating on ways to present new content on the site _meta_end_dot_

 and with her long experience editing newspapers she has become an invaluable traffic cop as we deal with managing _meta_number_ref_ editors _meta_number_ref_ feature writer and me _meta_end_dot_

 while bipm is technically a featured writer no one manages him except you guys _meta_end_dot_

 that was part of the deal when you bought his soul this is the first time i ve shared the site s content duties with anyone and while it was a little hard at first to let go it s been a huge help as i ve wrapped up my book and dealt with other responsibilities _meta_end_dot_

 this is pretty cool not just for the site itself but for me personally _meta_end_dot_
