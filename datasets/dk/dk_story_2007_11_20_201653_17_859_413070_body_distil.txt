  i freely admit to having a few very strong biases _meta_end_dot_

 perhaps the most basic gut level problem i have is with loud whining insistent exhaust emitting machines _meta_end_dot_

 leaf blowers are truly a crime against nature we have manual tools for that ones that make little noise and do the job remarkably efficiently with just a little sweat equity involved _meta_end_dot_

 so perhaps my utter hatred for snowmobiles comes from the noise _meta_end_dot_

 or maybe the smell _meta_end_dot_

 or maybe it comes from the yahoos of my childhood who thought recreation was getting liquored up and buzzing local ranch houses and cattle herds on their snow chariots in the middle of the night _meta_end_dot_

 in my book snowmobiles should exist for one reason only the one my aunt and uncle ranching in a remote corner of the county had _meta_end_dot_

 they never got plowed out so the snowmobile was their only link to civilization and supplies for months on end _meta_end_dot_

 i ve been thinking about snowmobiles as a result of my annual visit delayed until just this past weekend to yellowstone _meta_end_dot_

 the snow was just starting to fall around the lamar valley in the far northeast corner of the park when i passed through _meta_end_dot_

 my treks thus far have all taken place in summer and early fall and one of my primary goals for the near term is to see this remarkable place in winter _meta_end_dot_

 i ve read story after story about the magic that takes hold of this place when the snow falls _meta_end_dot_

 i fully intend to experience it and i don t want to see it through a cloud of exhaust _meta_end_dot_

 which is likelier to happen this year than last as park superintendent suzanne lewis has decided to support a plan allowing up to _meta_number_ref_ snowmobiles in the park per day _meta_end_dot_

 it gets better the park service is intending to push the decision through by the park s winter opening date of dec _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ despite the fact that they missed yesterday s deadline for issuing it meaning that the _meta_number_ref_ day public comment period on the decision will be cut short we still believe that we can get a record of decision signed get a rule published and open as scheduled despite the fact that we did not meet today s deadline park spokesman nash said adding the _meta_number_ref_ day comment period is a policy not a regulation and could be shortened maybe the fact that nearly three quarters of public commenters on the park s proposed management plan want a ban on snowmobiles has something to do with their lack of concern that public comment will be cut short one high profile opponent of snowmobiles in the park former assistant interior secretary for fish and wildlife and parks under the clinton administration don barry sees in this decision the kind of interference with science that has become too familiar in this administration s interior department _meta_end_dot_

 barry spoke to the association of national park rangers last month in the event that you haven t been there it s a big ol place _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ acres to be exact _meta_end_dot_

 the eis actually stated that for a noise to be harmful it actually has to reach across _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ acres _meta_end_dot_

 that s some science huh _meta_end_dot_

 beyond the noise there are the serious questions about air quality about the emissions from snowmobiles getting into the snowpack of the park and the inevitable stress on wildlife that have been at the center of this debate for the past decade _meta_end_dot_

 with the current administration in charge real science on all of these issues continues to be sacrificed for political expediency _meta_end_dot_

 the reality is there are alternatives for seeing the park in winter even motorized ones _meta_end_dot_

 snowcoaches have proven to be a cleaner quieter and highly popular alternative _meta_end_dot_

 by taking more people in with fewer trips and cleaner technology the snowcoaches provide a great alternative to hordes of snowmobiles _meta_end_dot_

 of course for those who really want to experience the park close up the same advice holds winter and summer _meta_end_dot_

 get away from your vehicle and go on foot _meta_end_dot_

 skis and snowshoes are more than welcome throughout the park _meta_end_dot_

 there are also alternatives for taking your machine out and making as much noise as you want _meta_end_dot_

 millions of empty acres exist all around the park s circumference why is it so damned important to take the damned things into one of our nation s most sacred shared spaces _meta_end_question_

 that s why eighty six members of the house of representatives have asked the park service to phase out snowmobiles in the park _meta_end_dot_

 tellingly none of the delegations from idaho montana or wyoming signed onto the letter instead they ve urged the opposite _meta_end_dot_

 on this issue i come firmly down on the side of the national over the regional interest _meta_end_dot_

 it s not just a regional resource it s an american icon _meta_end_dot_

 yellowstone national park holds the incredible distinction of being the world s first national park a place which is meant to conserve the scenery and the natural and historic objects and the wild life therein as stated in the organic act of _meta_number_ref_ and a public park or pleasuring ground for the benefit and enjoyment of the people as stated in the _meta_number_ref_ dedication _meta_end_dot_

 it would seem for the longterm benefit and enjoyment of the people it would make sense to take the most cautious road when it comes to managing this precious place _meta_end_dot_
