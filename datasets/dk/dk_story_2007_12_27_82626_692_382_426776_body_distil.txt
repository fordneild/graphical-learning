  hilarious spin by the ron paul blinder wearing partisans to revelations that their hero is a bigot so some of the times he participated in the composition of the newsletter which is of far less import than reviewing the words the newsletter carried under his own byline _meta_end_question_

 and what does being _meta_number_ref_ miles away have to do with anything _meta_end_question_

 they had fax machines in the _meta_number_ref_s _meta_end_dot_

 they had fedex and ups and usps _meta_end_dot_

 it was an _meta_number_ref_ page newsletter _meta_end_dot_

 it wasn t that big of an operation _meta_end_dot_

 so are we led to believe by a bunch of unnamed sources that ron paul is so stupid that he wouldn t demand prior review of content written not just in a newsletter bearing his name but under his own byline _meta_end_question_

 and that when he found out about it he was angry yet never retracted such statements in a subsequent issue of the newsletter that once again bore his name _meta_end_question_

 that s what we re supposed to believe _meta_end_question_

 if that s the case then why the silence _meta_end_question_

 his reasons are harder to understand because they make no sense _meta_end_dot_

 if he has moral responsibility for his comments then why not apologize or retract those statements _meta_end_question_

 why not express outrage that his good name was misappropriated with scurrilously racist sentiments and demand an honest admission and retraction in his newsletter _meta_end_question_

 why _meta_end_question_

 because he agreed with the sentiments _meta_end_dot_

 that s why _meta_end_dot_

 and it s precisely writings like those and his refusal to disavow them that have made him a favorite of the stormfront neo nazi crowd _meta_end_dot_

 of course paul s supporters will take this post along with any other criticism of their demigod as evidence that he is feared or other such nonsense _meta_end_dot_

 hardly _meta_end_dot_

 when he cracks single digits in the polls in any state we can start worrying _meta_end_dot_

 until then he doesn t even reach ross perot like nut status _meta_end_dot_

 i worry about mccain _meta_end_dot_

 i worry about huckabee _meta_end_dot_

 i used to worry about giuliani _meta_end_dot_

 but paul _meta_end_question_

 nah _meta_end_dot_

 he is what he is fringe _meta_end_dot_

 but it s also clear that some of his supporters would benefit from a full airing and education about what paul stands for and has stood for in his years in the public limelight _meta_end_dot_

 if people still want to support him despite his bigotry then that actually says more about his supporters than about ron paul himself _meta_end_dot_
