  nancy pelosi held a conference call with bloggers this morning and one of the issues discussed was the fisa fight and retroactive amnesty _meta_end_dot_

 tpmmuckraker reports the problem with this reasoning is its short sightedness _meta_end_dot_

 exclusivity the provision that states that only fisa and the criminal wiretapping statute provide the executive branch authority to wiretap can be revisited next year with likely larger democratic majorities in congress and democratic president _meta_end_dot_

 in fact most of the provisions in the proposed legislation could be _meta_end_dot_

 with one important exception retroactive amnesty for the telcos _meta_end_dot_

 once granted retroactive amnesty would be considered an acquired right _meta_end_dot_

 it couldn t be taken away _meta_end_dot_

 that toothpaste would be out of the tube forever _meta_end_dot_
