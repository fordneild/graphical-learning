  in polling interlude part i we talked about house effects and holiday polling in iowa _meta_end_dot_

 in part ii we talked about respected ia polls and the des moines register s topping the list based on _meta_number_ref_ results _meta_end_dot_

 well guess what _meta_end_question_

 despite skepticism this year dmr and j _meta_end_dot_

 anne selzer their pollster nailed some very important points _meta_end_dot_

 they predicted the _meta_number_ref_k dem turnout and they predicted obama _meta_percent_ref_ clinton _meta_percent_ref_ edwards _meta_percent_ref_ the obama win final numbers obama _meta_percent_ref_ clinton _meta_percent_ref_ edwards _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 obama hit _meta_percent_ref_ in the ia entrance poll _meta_end_dot_

 other important factors picked up by dmr _meta_percent_ref_ of dem delegates listed can bring change as the top candidate quality in the entrance poll obama grabbed _meta_percent_ref_ of that vote while only _meta_percent_ref_ listed experience hillary got _meta_percent_ref_ of them _meta_end_dot_

 edwards got the cares about people _meta_percent_ref_ delegates and the electability group only _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 according to the entrance poll _meta_percent_ref_ of attendees were first time caucus goers obama won that group by _meta_percent_ref_ to _meta_percent_ref_ clinton and _meta_percent_ref_ edwards _meta_end_dot_

 on the gop side dmr had huckabee _meta_percent_ref_ to romney _meta_percent_ref_ and had mccain _meta_number_ref_d at _meta_percent_ref_ thompson at _meta_percent_ref_ even though thompson edged out mccain by a whisker _meta_end_dot_

 in the entrance poll gop voters described themselves as very conservative _meta_percent_ref_ and somewhat conservative _meta_percent_ref_ and they went for huckabee as did religious beliefs of candidate matter delegates _meta_end_dot_

 a great deal _meta_percent_ref_ and somewhat _meta_percent_ref_ went for huck romney won the not much _meta_percent_ref_ and not at all _meta_percent_ref_ factions _meta_end_dot_

 iowa is not new hampshire _meta_end_dot_

 more analysis on the entrance poll is here by gary langer abc _meta_end_dot_

 after reading the dmr poll for both sides no one should have been surprised by either of the results _meta_end_dot_

 kudos to them and the fact that even they didn t nail every number tells us a great deal about how difficult iowa is to poll _meta_end_dot_
