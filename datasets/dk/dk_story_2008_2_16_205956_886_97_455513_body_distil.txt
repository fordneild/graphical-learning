  although the horizon on the democratic nomination seems to recede ever farther the primary season will conclude sooner than many of us anticipate _meta_end_dot_

 and when it s over the nominee will begin to shift toward the right _meta_end_dot_

 the rest of the campaign this year will be fought out on political territory less to our liking _meta_end_dot_

 the nominee s advisers the media and even some actual voters will demand a rightward shift in the name of centrism _meta_end_dot_

 you can count on it _meta_end_dot_

 the time to press the candidates to take an unequivocal stand on your issues is now _meta_end_dot_

 it s a pleasant fiction that your role during the primaries is simply to choose your candidate and cheerlead to donate at most to volunteer _meta_end_dot_

 what a limited vision of the nomination process _meta_end_dot_

 primaries weren t created just to identify a standard bearer for the party _meta_end_dot_

 if that s the goal a backroom deal would suffice _meta_end_dot_

 no primaries exist in order to allow voters to choose a candidate to represent their interests _meta_end_dot_

 now is the time to make your convictions known to pin the candidates down on the issues you care about and to make clear what you won t accept _meta_end_dot_

 this is your chance to shape their thinking and influence their positions because the eventual candidate is going to be less interested and less amenable to your pressure during the summer and fall than now _meta_end_dot_

 and after the election when your former candidate enters the bubble _meta_end_question_

 good luck with that _meta_end_dot_

 now is the time to push the candidates to ask them to enact specific policies to make clear that you ll hold them accountable on your issues _meta_end_dot_

 do you want an end to the occupation of iraq a sane approach toward iran an end to the bullying go it alone foreign policy _meta_end_question_

 will you accept nothing less than a renunciation of torture and international lawlessness the closure of guant namo bay prison the prosecution of the bush administration s criminal class the exposure of the whole sorry mess of the last seven years _meta_end_question_

 an end to the cult of state secrecy _meta_end_question_
