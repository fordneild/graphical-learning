  after an election there s always the immediate punditry exit polls and then a few weeks later some thoughtful analysis _meta_end_dot_

 after several months pass then the number crunchers and political scientists weigh in _meta_end_dot_

 one of the standard analyses of each election cycle comes from political scientist and respected election watcher gary jacobson _meta_end_dot_

 jacobson weighs polls and campaign dynamics such as spending by and on behalf of campaigns _meta_end_dot_

 but for jacobson one of the key factors in every congressional election is the composition of the electorate where it s clustered and the boundaries of congressional districts pdf what does jacobson think about the _meta_number_ref_ election as a precursor for _meta_number_ref_ and beyond _meta_end_question_

 jacobson is wise to put emphasis on what he refers to as structural issues which in the end amounts mostly to the distribution of voters _meta_end_dot_

 but he s wrong that there s little reason to believe _meta_number_ref_ will be any different _meta_end_dot_

 built in to his assumptions are a bias toward the belief that voters and the electorate change slowly and that changes between elections are generally pendulum swings emanating from a fairly unmoving equilibrium _meta_end_dot_

 if one questions those assumptions and adds in demographic change a broader historical scope the importance of ideas and other structural matters like money for candidates and campaigns and the support of key elites there are numerous reasons to think that the _meta_number_ref_ and _meta_number_ref_ campaigns cycles won t resemble the _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ or _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ cycles _meta_end_dot_

 it s more likely that the _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ cycles will bear a greater resemblance to the _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ campaign cycle the elections that preceded and then brought in franklin delano roosevelt and the creation of the new deal voting coalition _meta_end_dot_
