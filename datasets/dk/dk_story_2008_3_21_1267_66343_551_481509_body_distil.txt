  well gosh _meta_end_exclamation_

 the oh so terribly accident prone bush cheney administration has its nose in hillary clinton s passport files too _meta_end_dot_

 what a shocker _meta_end_exclamation_

 thousands of oops _meta_end_exclamation_

 illegally issued national security letters _meta_end_dot_

 the fbi accidentally vacuuming up a whole company s e mails instead of just a targeted person s _meta_end_dot_

 the continuing nightmare of the no fly list _meta_end_dot_

 and now the breach of the passport files of both barack obama and hillary clinton _meta_end_dot_

 oh and john mccain s _meta_end_dot_

 yes i said hillary clinton _meta_end_dot_

 not bill clinton _meta_end_dot_

 george h w _meta_end_dot_

 bush s state department already rifled that file in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 but gosh what a coincidence _meta_end_exclamation_

 what an amazing development eh _meta_end_question_

 george h w _meta_end_dot_

 bush s state department sticks their nose into bill clinton s passport file but the responsible official resigns and nothing ever comes of it _meta_end_dot_

 lesson learned _meta_end_question_

 sure _meta_end_exclamation_

 now george w _meta_end_dot_

 bush s state department is free to stick its nose into hillary clinton s files _meta_end_dot_

 plus anyone else it feels like poking around on _meta_end_dot_

 and like almost everything that happens around condoleezza rice no one could have foreseen it _meta_end_exclamation_

 dangerous domestic spying _meta_end_question_

 or just imprudent use of a new class of massive all encompassing total information awareness style databases by unnamed and unidentifiable outside contractors and low level employees who knows _meta_end_question_

 and does it really make a difference _meta_end_question_

 so long as a government official in a proper looking suit tells reporters from behind a proper looking podium with a proper looking seal on it and proper looking blue draperies behind that it s been taken care of though they can t tell you the names of the employees confidentiality you know or the name of the contractor national security you know then everything s just find and dandy right _meta_end_question_

 besides it s just another opportunity for republicans to point out how big government doesn t work _meta_end_dot_

 just look _meta_end_exclamation_

 we can t make it work either _meta_end_exclamation_

 and if that contractor was a government employee teh unionz would make it impossible for us to fire him _meta_end_dot_

 so really this breach was a terrific way for us to demonstrate that outsourcing really works _meta_end_exclamation_

 sure we had to let someone totally unvetted and totally untrustworthy access sensitive personal information about our opposition s top political leaders to prove it but prove it we did _meta_end_exclamation_

 after all we just announced that this unverifiable person was unverifiably fired _meta_end_dot_

 what more proof of our dedication to security and freedom could you want _meta_end_question_

 now just because it s happened before and there have been no consequences beyond perhaps having to tell a congressional committee you can t recall anything about it doesn t necessarily mean it ll happen again right _meta_end_question_

 after all didn t the vigorous investigation into illegal political operations at the gsa set things right _meta_end_question_

 well i don t know _meta_end_dot_

 you tell me _meta_end_dot_

 fifteen other agencies turned out to have held the same briefings and instructions on how to help republican candidates and the education department is back at it even today on behalf of norm coleman _meta_end_dot_

 hearings and sternly worded letters tm don t mean squat to these people _meta_end_dot_

 it used to be the republican mantra that anything goes except getting caught _meta_end_dot_

 but eventually they came to realize that getting caught wasn t the real issue _meta_end_dot_

 it was getting punished that was worth worrying about _meta_end_dot_

 at least until the president commutes your sentence retroactively immunizes you exempts you from the law or otherwise laughs off punishment anyway _meta_end_dot_

 of course in the case of the passport files there s now the added layer of obfuscation created by having contracted this state department work out _meta_end_dot_

 it wasn t us _meta_end_exclamation_

 it was the outside contractors true _meta_end_question_

 maybe _meta_end_dot_

 but how does it make you feel about the prospects of the bush cheney administration treating the supposed limits written into sen _meta_end_dot_

 jay rockefeller s proposed free pass for domestic spying for instance _meta_end_question_

 oh it wasn t us snooping in the phone and e mail records of the democratic nominee s campaign _meta_end_dot_

 no no _meta_end_exclamation_

 it was _meta_end_dot_

 ummm a low level contract worker for one of the telecoms we gave immunity to _meta_end_exclamation_

 yeah that s the ticket _meta_end_exclamation_

 now move along nothing to see here but of course we ll be conducting vigorous oversight to prevent look into these things after the fact so all s well right _meta_end_question_

 henry waxman for instance has already issued a sternly worded letter tm _meta_end_dot_

 let s hope condi doesn t decide she s not inclined to answer this time _meta_end_dot_

 if she does answer it now seems clear that we re going to have to have a list of names and ask individually whether those files have been breached since that s apparently what it takes to get the state department to fess up to the snooping taking place on condi s watch _meta_end_dot_

 here s a list i d be curious about senators baucus bayh carper casey conrad inouye johnson kohl landrieu lieberman lincoln mccaskill mikulski ben nelson bill nelson pryor rockefeller salazar webb and whitehouse _meta_end_dot_

 have any of those files been breached _meta_end_question_

 why _meta_end_question_

 well maybe i ve taken things a little bit far afield here but let me just take the opportunity to ask senator rockefeller and his _meta_number_ref_ democratic senate colleagues who voted for his fisa abomination this still think it s safe to trust this administration with properly guarding sensitive private information _meta_end_question_

 still think everything s gonna be just fine with immunizing the private contractors who are supposed to be partners with the government in handling this stuff responsibly _meta_end_question_

 will oops _meta_end_exclamation_

 well we ll fire some low level contractors really be a sufficient trade off for turning the fourth amendment inside out and granting unprecedented snooping powers to people so demonstrably irresponsible with it _meta_end_question_

 seriously senators _meta_end_dot_

 you can t possibly be this stupid _meta_end_dot_

 do they really have to literally be in your skivvies before you get a clue _meta_end_question_
