  are you frustrated at florida rep _meta_end_dot_

 debbie wasserman schultz recusing herself in her capacity as the dccc s red to blue co chair from three critical races in her home region of south florida _meta_end_question_

 do you believe as i do that it is critical for our elected democrats especially our democratic leaders and most particularly the few we entrust with expanding our congressional majorities to provide as much support as possible for strong democratic candidates everywhere _meta_end_question_

 if so it is time to take action _meta_end_dot_

 to recap wasserman schultz along with fellow florida rep _meta_end_dot_

 kendrick meek recently told the miami herald that they would be on the sidelines for three high profile races in south florida with republican incumbents in the _meta_number_ref_th _meta_number_ref_st and _meta_number_ref_th districts _meta_end_dot_

 these races pit respectively compounding the problem wasserman schultz was also recently quoted heaping praise on ileana ros lehtinen which surely can t do much for annette taddeo s campaign _meta_end_dot_

 this would be upsetting under any circumstances it s always frustrating to see powerful local political figures whose endorsements and support could be of critical importance sitting out a race where a democratic candidate has a real shot _meta_end_dot_

 but it is all the more important due to wasserman schultz position as the dccc s red to blue co chair _meta_end_dot_

 she is personally responsible for doing everything she can to expand the democratic majority as much as is within her power _meta_end_dot_

 the people running the dccc have to be cutthroat _meta_end_dot_

 that s the nature of the job _meta_end_dot_

 it s an overtly partisan position _meta_end_dot_

 if it s impossible for wasserman schultz to be that person then the position should go to someone who can _meta_end_dot_

 and as davidnyc points out at swing state project the dccc has dismissed our concerns on these races so far well that s a custom which wasserman schultz was able to break with in _meta_number_ref_ when she found it in her heart to support florida democrat ron klein in his bid to upset republican rep _meta_end_dot_

 clay shaw _meta_end_dot_

 frankly with wasserman schultz being a high profile and well respected south florida democrat as well as the red to blue co chair i should think her assistance with these races should be of the utmost significance and importance _meta_end_dot_

 most of this has been covered in more detail and greater elegance in davidnyc s terrific series of diaries _meta_end_dot_

 so looking forward what exactly would we have rep _meta_end_dot_

 wasserman schultz do _meta_end_question_

 ideally she should declare her staunch and unqualified support for annette taddeo raul martinez and joe garcia and hold a fundraiser for each of them _meta_end_dot_

 if she s unable to do that she should resign as red to blue co chair _meta_end_dot_

 if she can t be a partisan bulldog that s one thing but she should give the job to someone who will _meta_end_dot_

 you can help take action and pressure rep _meta_end_dot_
