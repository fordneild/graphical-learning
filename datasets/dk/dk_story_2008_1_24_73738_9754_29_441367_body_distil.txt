  in _meta_number_ref_ mattel introduced a doll named chatty cathy pull cathy s string and she could say eleven different things _meta_end_dot_

 that s ten more things than republicans have to say about the economy _meta_end_dot_

 mitt romney rudy giuliani john mccain hang on a sec let me pull that string _meta_end_dot_

 surplus _meta_end_question_

 let s cut taxes for the rich and for corporations _meta_end_exclamation_

 and another pull _meta_end_dot_

 war _meta_end_question_

 let s cut taxes for the rich and for corporations _meta_end_exclamation_

 and one more _meta_end_dot_

 recession _meta_end_question_

 let s cut taxes for the rich and for corporations _meta_end_exclamation_

 but republican cathy haven t all those tax cuts run up a huge deficit that s helping to wreck our economy _meta_end_question_

 what about the poor and middle class _meta_end_question_

 poor people suck _meta_end_dot_

 let s cut taxes for the rich and for corporations _meta_end_exclamation_

 no matter what the situation republicans have only one response _meta_end_dot_

 in the _meta_number_ref_s the first pass at reaganomics left the us with a crippling debt that took a decade to get under control _meta_end_dot_

 then before a sensible policy had time to repair the excesses of the _meta_number_ref_s bush arrived to double down on the damage _meta_end_dot_

 again they showered gifts on the rich and poured funds into the coffers of corporations where executives rewarded themselves with bonuses that would make scrooge mcduck blush _meta_end_dot_

 in the meantime the middle class was not seeing a wave of new jobs or an increase in salary _meta_end_dot_

 because as we saw in the _meta_number_ref_s and have demonstrated conclusively over the last seven years reaganomics is a lie _meta_end_dot_

 cutting taxes at the top and reducing regulation benefits only the top of the corporate economy _meta_end_dot_

 there is no trickle down because greed expands to absorb any excess _meta_end_dot_

 every portion of conservative economics is designed to loot the economy _meta_end_dot_

 taking the damp dishrag of the american economy in both hands republicans have wrung it out again and again while crying shop _meta_end_exclamation_

 shop if you love america and the republicans have channeled every drop that spills straight to the thirsty folks in the executive suite _meta_end_dot_

 hugely increasing the misery this time is the two trillion dollars poured into the fantasy of iraq _meta_end_dot_

 the constant unending burden of supporting republican folly in iraq has made many of bush and cheney s friends fabulously wealthy but for the rest of us iraq is a sea anchor dragging us back _meta_end_dot_

 back and down _meta_end_dot_

 moveon has been right to label this the iraq recession _meta_end_dot_

 getting out of the iraq recession means not pulling the gops string again _meta_end_dot_

 honestly listening to the repeated sayings from a mechanical doll is irritating _meta_end_dot_

 listening to the republicans again could be fatal _meta_end_dot_
