  a cool january has elicited gleeful celebration among conservatives still caught in the grip of climate change denial _meta_end_dot_

 a good illustration can be found in the blog section of a site called daily tech but the nasa giss site referenced above says nothing of the sort about _meta_number_ref_ a near record warm year and a dramatically colder one what the heck _meta_end_question_

 well january _meta_number_ref_ was cooler than average that much is true _meta_end_dot_

 but somewhere along the way in the d tech diary one month was replaced with twelve month long drop and past year that screw up was then compounded by the diarist erroneously proclaiming it erases a century of global warming a popular refrain in the mostly glowing comment section that follows is it s the sun i doubt many of those pointing to the sun bothered to ask an astronomer but i asked a bad astronomer who said there are dozens of observatories on earth and in space scrutinizing solar output at every wavelength _meta_end_dot_

 there are thousands of scientists all over the world who spend their entire professional lives examining that data _meta_end_dot_

 when someone comes along and asks how come you smart scientists never thought of the sun as if they ve hit on a novel explanation for climate change the response from the scientific community is little more than laughter _meta_end_dot_

 this may be old hat for regulars but we have a lot of new eyeballs around so it s useful to review the point i brought up yesterday this stuff gets pinged around the internet gaining a life of its own until it gets mainstreamed _meta_end_dot_

 that d tech post has already been linked by loads of wingnut sites including drudge _meta_end_dot_

 from there it quickly found its way into my email box along with indignant demands from conservatives that i post the truth _meta_end_dot_

 which incidentally i just did even though it s probably not the truth they wanted to hear _meta_end_dot_

 odds are it s only a matter of time before we hear a talking head solemnly asking how climate change alarmists explain the record drop in global temperatures over the past year apply that same procedure to any right wing zombie lie you choose and you get a feel for why they re so hard to kill _meta_end_dot_
