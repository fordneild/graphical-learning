  in just over two weeks on march _meta_number_ref_ there will be a special election in indiana s _meta_number_ref_th district to fill the seat of the recently deceased rep _meta_end_dot_

 julia carson _meta_end_dot_

 the indianapolis based district is strongly democratic at the federal level but rep _meta_end_dot_

 carson often ran closer than expected races _meta_end_dot_

 she won _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ in _meta_number_ref_ against an opponent with no money although he did share a name with a famous nfl running back _meta_end_dot_

 recent trends have not been great in this district either the incumbent democratic mayor of indianapolis bart peterson lost to an underfunded republican in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 now carson s grandson indianapolis city councilor andre carson is the democratic candidate in the special election to fill her seat _meta_end_dot_

 he is opposed by state rep _meta_end_dot_

 jon elrod who defeated a democratic incumbent in _meta_number_ref_ to win his seat _meta_end_dot_

 elrod recently got into a bit of hot water when he was caught on videotape writing campaign letters on the house floor elrod poses as a moderate and on some issues he is but as blue indiana notes he supports privatizing social security supports the bush tax cuts opposes abortion rights and opposes so called arbitrary timetables for withdrawal from iraq _meta_end_dot_

 given recent trends there s every reason to think the race will be close despite the district s d _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ lean _meta_end_dot_

 that being the case john mccain who held a fundraiser for il _meta_number_ref_ candidate jim oberweis last week stopped by indianapolis yesterday for a town hall event but apparently decided he didn t feel like fundraising or campaigning for elrod _meta_end_dot_

 as the crypt notes this is a race the republicans actually have a shot at winning in a more democratic district than any they currently possess _meta_end_dot_

 the fact that they aren t bringing out the big guns for this race speaks to a lack of resources and political capital on their part which is great and implies that we re in a strong position going forward across the country _meta_end_dot_

 but this will certainly be a race to watch over the next couple weeks and while we re favored nothing is guaranteed _meta_end_dot_
