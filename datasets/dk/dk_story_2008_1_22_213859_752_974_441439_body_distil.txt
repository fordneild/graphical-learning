  fareed zakaria has declared the iraq war largely over apparently zakaria and his editors at newsweek have some difficulty with basic constructs of logic _meta_end_dot_

 how can it be somewhat ended largely _meta_end_question_

 is that like sort of pregnant for the u s _meta_end_dot_

 as along as our troops are still dying there _meta_end_question_

 it is however an attempt at a new conventional wisdom from the villagers to continue to prop up the glories of the surge and presumably the prospects of their favorite candidate john mccain _meta_end_dot_

 in fact zakaria notes john mccain deserves credit for supporting the surge this announcement that the war is largely ended would also be news to david petraeus who in true broken record fashion has announced that he needs another six months to determine if we ve really turned a corner in iraq _meta_end_dot_

 what s particularly disturbing to me though is that as newsweek s international editor zakaria has such a short sighted and limited view of the ongoing damage this war is doing not just in the us and not just in iraq but around the world _meta_end_dot_

 and because of the far flung damage how critical it truly is for the us to drastically change its course in iraq _meta_end_dot_

 i was with a group of swedes in reno this weekend observing the caucuses _meta_end_dot_

 after saturday s events we were talking together about the impact this war has had across the world but particularly in sweden which has absorbed thousands of iraqis who have fled their country in fact more than _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ just in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 one of my new friends forwarded this article to me today nearly a quarter of malm s population of _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ is now muslim _meta_end_dot_

 not all of the muslim immigrants are new arrivals from iraq but as the sectarian violence continues and living conditions in iraq continue to deteriorate more will come _meta_end_dot_

 they will come to be with their friends and family members they will come because sweden has opened its borders to them is willing to step into the humanitarian crisis that the united states has perpetrated on the rest of the world _meta_end_dot_

 sweden of course isn t alone _meta_end_dot_

 the unhrc reported last week that _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ million iraqis have been forced to leave their homes _meta_end_dot_

 some two million of them are believed to be displaced within iraq _meta_end_dot_

 there s much more at stake in november than just the lives of american soldiers as critical as that is _meta_end_dot_

 the republican front runners continue to fall over themselves to avow their commitment to keeping the u s _meta_end_dot_

 in iraq to fulfill the grand vision of the men who still haven t gotten over the fact that we lost vietnam and who doomed us to failure before the first troop set foot in iraq _meta_end_dot_

 they would keep us there and isolate us further from the world community isolating us and grinding into dust the reputation and the status of a once great nation _meta_end_dot_

 last summer i spoke at a gathering of international citizen journalists in seoul _meta_end_dot_

 one of my colleagues a young australian expressed plaintively his country s dismay at the united states and how critical this year s election is to his people _meta_end_dot_

 it was a sentiment echoed by the swedes i met last weekend _meta_end_dot_

 you will get no more second chances from the rest of the world
