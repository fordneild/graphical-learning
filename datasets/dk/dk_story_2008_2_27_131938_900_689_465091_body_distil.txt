  from the new york observer which it should be pointed out is in a state that has already cast its votes for the democratic presidential nominee hillary clinton s candidacy depends on her winning ohio and texas _meta_end_dot_

 the trends macro and micro look bad for her _meta_end_dot_

 and _meta_number_ref_ days before the contests that could end her quest for the presidency her chief strategist spent _meta_number_ref_ minutes on the phone essentially selling himself and by implication screwing his rivals within the campaign _meta_end_dot_

 if hillary clinton doesn t win the democratic nomination and it looks like she probably won t the campaign obituaries will surely all focus on the pernicious effect on her candidacy of mark penn _meta_end_dot_

 al gore had the good sense to fire penn early in the campaign it was one of the best moves he made the entire campaign _meta_end_dot_
