  john mccain yesterday said i m not the youngest candidate but i m the most experienced true enough but from the very start of his congressional career mccain s experience has involved chasing after lobbyists money _meta_end_dot_

 in the case of vicki iseman at least it may also have meant chasing after her _meta_end_dot_

 one part of the nyt story bolstered now by the wapo perfectly encapsulates what it s about and what mccain is all about _meta_end_dot_

 it comes right after the times notes that some current aides to mccain contend that the senator sided with ms _meta_end_dot_

 iseman s clients only when their positions hewed to his principles mccain himself refused to be interviewed for the story it turns out that in the late _meta_number_ref_s there was an awful lot of hewing to mccain s principles going on _meta_end_dot_

 so mccain uses undue pressure to try to force the fcc to grant a sweetheart deal to iseman s clients involving several pittsburgh tv stations _meta_end_dot_

 he s so far out of line that he gets rebuked by the fcc chairman _meta_end_dot_

 the episode becomes known and draws public comparisons to mccain s efforts on behalf of charles keating a dozen years earlier _meta_end_dot_

 and mccain tries to dispel allegations of wrongdoing by suppressing information about a cozy flight he took with iseman after a miami fundraiser earlier that same year _meta_end_dot_

 in _meta_number_ref_ cipb filed this rather more detailed report about mccain s efforts on behalf of paxson in the pittsburgh case _meta_end_dot_

 cipb was demanding an investigation of mccain s activities _meta_end_dot_

 hoo boy that s some kind of hewing _meta_end_dot_

 not one but two inappropriate letters to the fcc in less than a month _meta_end_dot_

 one letter asked that the commission a hurry up and b tell mccain in advance that they ll get the job done for him _meta_end_dot_

 the second letter demands an explanation if they fail to hurry up _meta_end_dot_

 this is a senator whom somebody has lit a flame under that somebody was vicki iseman _meta_end_dot_

 when mccain published his autobiography three years later he had this to say about those principles that everybody in this story was hewing to worth the fighting for pp _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ heh _meta_end_dot_

 maverick _meta_end_question_

 no _meta_end_dot_

 straight talker _meta_end_question_

 not on your life _meta_end_dot_

 experienced _meta_end_question_

 sure in the charms of washington lobbyists _meta_end_dot_
