  the obama campaign has trumpeted the _meta_dollor_ref_ million it raised in january for all to hear _meta_end_dot_

 the clinton campaign has been quiet however _meta_end_dot_

 apparently the number is about _meta_dollor_ref_ million _meta_end_dot_

 that was us news world report citing abc news for that info _meta_end_dot_

 i looked for confirmation at the abc news site and found nothing but the number was also cited by timmeh this sunday as fact _meta_end_dot_

 so who knows _meta_end_dot_

 also note that at least _meta_dollor_ref_ million could be _meta_dollor_ref_ million with the clinton campaign playing coy for strategic reasons _meta_end_dot_

 i don t know what those reasons could possibly be but it s always a possibility _meta_end_dot_

 if true clinton is in serious trouble as this thing drags on _meta_end_dot_

 note that obama s huge explosion of donations came after his new hampshire loss _meta_end_dot_

 it doesn t look like clinton got a similar boost after her south carolina loss _meta_end_dot_

 if she can t put this thing away tomorrow and it s hard to see how she could absent an unlikely rout her fundraising will continue to suffer vis a vis obama and that would prove deadly in a protracted campaign _meta_end_dot_

 her best ally at this point is the ridiculous expectations obama supporters have for tomorrow _meta_end_dot_

 clinton is going to win the day _meta_end_dot_

 the key is to limit her margin of victory and keep it close enough for obama to catch up later in the month and into march and april _meta_end_dot_

 but if obama supporters build themselves up to the point they actually think they can win tomorrow by citing bogus polls by zogby for example and cherry picking the best of the other polls then anything but a victory will be a demoralizing letdown _meta_end_dot_

 this isn t about lowering expectations _meta_end_dot_

 it s about the reality of the situation _meta_end_dot_

 obama has been slowly building up and has had to overcome huge advantages enjoyed by the clintons _meta_end_dot_

 it s about the calendar see below and how it plays to obama s strengths later in the month _meta_end_dot_

 there s no need to bet everything on tomorrow _meta_end_dot_

 it s all about how well he loses _meta_end_dot_

 the narrower the loss the bigger his actual victory _meta_end_dot_

 not that my cautions will have much of an effect _meta_end_dot_

 irrational exuberance is running rampant just like before new hampshire _meta_end_dot_

 you d think people would learn their lessons _meta_end_dot_
