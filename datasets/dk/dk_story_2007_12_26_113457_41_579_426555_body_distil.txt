  from the diaries smintheus as the washington post detailed on tuesday the supreme court this term will decide a set of voter identification cases which could well determine the outcome of the _meta_number_ref_ election _meta_end_dot_

 in a narrow legal sense the cases will address the constitutionality of new voter id laws in indiana and other states _meta_end_dot_

 but more important the roberts court will decide whether to rubber stamp an essential tactic in the all out republican war to suppress the votes of minority and likely democratic americans _meta_end_dot_

 the combined cases to be argued on january _meta_number_ref_th crawford v _meta_end_dot_

 marion county election board and indiana democratic party v _meta_end_dot_

 rokita have their genesis in the wave of draconian new voter identification laws passed by republican majority statehouses around the nation _meta_end_dot_

 as the post noted indiana joined georgia missouri and arizona in enacting stringent new photo id requirements for voters despite a complete absence of polling place fraud in these or any other state the state law he and the legislature came up with requires voters to show a government issued photo id that has an expiration date such as a driver s license or a passport _meta_end_dot_

 nondrivers can receive an identification card from the bureau of motor vehicles _meta_end_dot_

 to date the courts have agreed with rokita _meta_end_dot_

 the seventh circuit court of appeals upheld the indiana law by a _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ margin _meta_end_dot_

 unsurprisingly the court s two republican appointees blessed the indiana republican tactic _meta_end_dot_

 reagan appointee judge richard posner proclaimed it is exceedingly difficult to maneuver in today s america without a photo id but clinton appointee terence evans in his dissent stated the obvious motivation and desired outcome of the hoosier state gop gambit which is exactly right _meta_end_dot_

 as i detailed just before the _meta_number_ref_ mid terms the indiana georgia and other similar laws are an essential ingredient of the republican strategy of divide suppress and conquer which aims to drive down the participation of potential democratic and independent voters through unprecented redistricting curbs on registration onerous new id requirements and polling place eligibility challenges voter suppression has been a centerpiece of the karl rove republican electoral strategy in both the states and within the bush administration _meta_end_dot_

 while supporting the new voter id laws the bush administration s only prosecution for violations of the _meta_number_ref_ voting rights act was against the african american head of the democratic party in noxubee county mississippi for using coercion and intimidation to prevent the white voters from going to the polls voter suppression after all was the primary objective of alberto gonzales purge of united states attorneys _meta_end_dot_

 as i wrote in march in _meta_number_ref_ the supreme court will decide whether or not the republican party will succeed in its fraudulent campaign against mythical vote fraud _meta_end_dot_

 it does not require a crystal ball to predict where john roberts and sam alito will come down on the issue with the republican party in danger of losing the white house and yielding even larger democratic majorities in congress the stakes for the gop are high indeed _meta_end_dot_

 the stakes for the american people and the future of american democracy of course are much higher _meta_end_dot_
