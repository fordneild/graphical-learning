 then he flubbed the tragedy in pakistan based on old news _meta_end_dot_

 and now he s blowing it on late night tv _meta_end_dot_

 he is scheduled to appear on the tonight show with jay leno tonight _meta_end_dot_

 jay is returning after a long strike hiatus which is ongoing for the writers _meta_end_dot_

 david letterman is also returning but he was able to come to terms with the wga and he will be back with his full writing staff as will craig ferguson who is also under dave s worldwide pants productions _meta_end_dot_
