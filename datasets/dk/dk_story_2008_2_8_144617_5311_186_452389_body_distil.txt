  there s talk on the republican side of a mccain huckabee ticket _meta_end_question_

 seriously _meta_end_question_

 because huckabee is doing so well and mccain needs to prove his right wing social credentials and cpac styled movement conservatives need their heads to spin a little more vigorously i suppose _meta_end_question_

 i have to admit it sounds like a brilliant plan _meta_end_dot_

 in the middle of a hugely unpopular war take the most aggressively pro war candidate and make him commander in chief _meta_end_dot_

 then what the hell add a heavy dose of hardcore far right evangelical christian rhetoric to the mix _meta_end_dot_

 bombs for jesus doesn t that sound like the bestest idea ever _meta_end_question_

 the whole problem with bush you see was the annoying subtlety with which he pursued his highly complex and well thought out positions _meta_end_dot_

 can t we just distill that down to even more explicit support for unending preemptive military action and explicit declarations of jesus based manifest destiny _meta_end_question_

 why have bush when we can have a double dose mecha transformer wonder twin powers activate super bush _meta_end_question_

 hey why the hell not _meta_end_question_

 here s another idea let s get everyone in america to drive a six inch railroad spike into the back of our heads _meta_end_dot_

 that way we ll all have a place to hang our raincoats _meta_end_dot_

 i love modern conservatism _meta_end_dot_

 no matter how disastrous any outcome of conservative policy is there s only one possible response let s do more of it _meta_end_exclamation_
