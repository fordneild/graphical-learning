  as you know congressman and mccain campaign arizona co chair rick renzi has been indicted on charges of conspiracy wire fraud money laundering extortion insurance fraud criminal forfeiture so as you contemplate the state in which the bush cheney administration has left our department of justice you might also want to keep the flip side of their slow poisoning of american justice in mind you might also take a moment to wonder whether we d ever have seen renzi indicted at all had it not been for the dogged pursuit by the new media of this story _meta_end_dot_

 and here i speak most specifically of josh marshall _meta_end_dot_

 recall your traditional media s initial reading of the story and _meta_end_dot_

 gosh _meta_end_dot_

 tit for tat where did we just see that mealy mouthed excuse for shrinking from responsibility mentioned _meta_end_question_

 alberto gonzales should have been impeached _meta_end_dot_

 instead american punditry insisted this was nothing and congress satisfied itself with allowing gonzales to move on to the lecture circuit unsullied by the criminality that average americans who have given up on the sycophantic media knew was plain to see _meta_end_dot_

 keep this in mind won t you while your traditional media and pundits fall all over themselves to get on tv to tell you that the mccain iseman issue is a non story another stark example of what atrios always says is our stupid discourse there s an entire professional corps of serious looking people whose job it is to tell you that your curiosity about what the people who run our government are doing is a non story how are you liking the results so far folks _meta_end_question_

 could this be why a million of you are reading this blog every day _meta_end_question_

 hmm _meta_end_question_
