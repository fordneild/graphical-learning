  since the beginning of the _meta_number_ref_ election cycle i have generally been quite pleased and impressed by the performance of the democratic congressional campaign committee _meta_end_dot_

 i think they ve made some mistakes here and there they re only human but overall i ve been quite happy with the dccc s performance _meta_end_dot_

 it s hard to argue with results and we ve gained _meta_number_ref_ seats in that time capped by an impressive victory in saturday s il _meta_number_ref_ special election which delivered the seat of a former republican speaker of the house to our democratic party _meta_end_dot_

 that said i find this unacceptable rep _meta_end_dot_

 debbie wasserman schultz co chair of the dccc s red to blue program apparently won yes we do rep _meta_end_dot_

 wasserman schultz _meta_end_dot_

 look at some level i understand not wanting to campaign against your friends _meta_end_dot_

 i do _meta_end_dot_

 i also understand that the florida delegation has long had a non aggression pact and that wasserman schultz broke tradition by campaigning against clay shaw in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 but as co chair of red to blue wasserman schultz isn t an ordinary rep _meta_end_dot_

 in her capacity at the dccc her chief responsibility her highest priority is to do whatever it takes to win in every district we have a chance at winning _meta_end_dot_

 if it makes you a jerk to campaign against your friends and neighbors fine _meta_end_dot_

 you ve got to be bloody ruthless if you re serious about maximizing democratic gains _meta_end_dot_

 if you re not prepared to do that that s ok but maybe the dccc job isn t for you _meta_end_dot_

 surely it s not for everyone _meta_end_dot_

 as james l _meta_end_dot_

 writes in a must read piece at swing state project seriously go read it right now i can t imagine rahm emanuel doing this _meta_end_dot_

 whatever his faults he is a partisan fighter who is willing to get his hands dirty _meta_end_dot_

 i expect wasserman schultz to do the same and given her prominence in south florida i think it really undermines the three fine democratic candidates in fl _meta_number_ref_ fl _meta_number_ref_ and fl _meta_number_ref_ respectively annette taddeo raul martinez and joe garcia for wasserman schultz to sit these races out _meta_end_dot_

 this is the best opportunity we ve had to take these seats in years and it s her obligation to do everything she can to make that happen _meta_end_dot_
