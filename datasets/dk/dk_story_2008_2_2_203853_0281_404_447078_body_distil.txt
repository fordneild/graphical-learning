  michael savage _meta_number_ref_ radio stations nationwide opines about africa with a caller kojo imus of course got fired for far less _meta_end_dot_

 so has limbaugh in the past _meta_end_dot_

 in fact you d maybe have to go back a half century or more to find a time when this sort of explicit africans are subhuman crap was acceptable public discourse _meta_end_dot_

 but the difference is of course that if you ve got a syndicator that thrives on racist stuff you can t get fired for it _meta_end_dot_

 and none of the station managers that carry savage s program give a damn either _meta_end_dot_

 think they ll apologize for running racist drivel right from the klan or stormfront spigot _meta_end_question_

 think bob agnew of knew radio in san francisco savage s home station gives a damn when he brags about the ratings that savage gets _meta_end_question_

 of course not _meta_end_dot_

 so we re stuck with klan radio because klan radio pays the bills and advertisers don t have any problems advertising on a program that asserts africans can t reason except with machetes and the hundreds of program directors and station managers that broadcast those words while they will assure you no doubt that they deplore racism find quite enough merit in savage s words to make sure they continue to put them out over their airwaves _meta_end_dot_

 savage won t apologize because he doesn t have to _meta_end_dot_

 klan speech sells _meta_end_dot_

 advertisers buy racism _meta_end_dot_
