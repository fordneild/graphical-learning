  yesterday you may have heard that paul begala would be going to work for hillary clinton s campaign _meta_end_dot_

 begala himself at huffington post in case you re thinking maybe begala issued a non denial denial he includes his email exchange with the reporter at fox which includes this since it s fox it s not even worth cracking jokes about journalistic ethics _meta_end_dot_

 but you have to wonder what the ulterior motive was here _meta_end_dot_

 hitting rival cnn where begala is a commentator _meta_end_question_

 begala himself _meta_end_question_

 reliable conservative target hillary clinton _meta_end_question_

 or are they just so shoddy they don t even need a reason to get something wrong _meta_end_question_
