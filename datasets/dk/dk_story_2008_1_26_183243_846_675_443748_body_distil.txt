  _meta_percent_ref_ of precincts reporting last weeks republican turnout was actually lower than expected _meta_end_dot_

 but predictions for the democrats have been running high _meta_end_dot_

 and as numbers have started to come in during the day it appears those predictions have been correct _meta_end_dot_

 any upward movement today s numbers would be another sign of momentum for the democratic party and that independents were bypassing the gop contest for a chance at our candidates _meta_end_dot_

 with gop turnout down by more than _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ from _meta_number_ref_ there s even the chance that democratic turnout could actually better that of republicans _meta_end_dot_

 considering the numeric advantage republicans hold in south carolina that would be amazing _meta_end_dot_
