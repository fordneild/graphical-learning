  can obama close the deal in texas and ohio _meta_end_question_

 a look at the results and exit polls from maryland and virginia suggest he can _meta_end_dot_

 the results in maryland and virginia are probably a better measure of what to expect going in to march _meta_number_ref_th and beyond than the results from the super tuesday states _meta_end_dot_

 the reason is resources _meta_end_dot_

 obama invested ground resources early in almost all the states _meta_end_dot_

 this proved very valuable in the caucus states and provided a tremendous return on the early investment _meta_end_dot_

 neither candidate spent much on television in most of the states _meta_end_dot_

 the clinton campaign concentrated it s resources in the big states especially california _meta_end_dot_

 thus in some places she was on parity with obama s money neither had a big advantage in time spent in the state and she was essentially able to protect the early lead she started out with in just about every state other than illinois _meta_end_dot_

 unless the trajectory of the campaigns dramatically change from here onward it s likely that obama will outspend clinton _meta_end_dot_

 he s taking in twice as much money and he s getting glorious press coverage _meta_end_dot_

 she still starts out ahead in ohio texas and pennsylvania her other must win state _meta_end_dot_

 but obama will probably outspend her maybe by a lot and as the campaign comes to their state they will start seeing coverage on their local news of obama events in their state and maybe even their local metro area and they will begin to receive direct voter contact in the form of mail phone calls and possibly door to door canvassing _meta_end_dot_

 therefore the virginia and maryland results are a good measure of not just inherent strengths and weaknesses of the candidates but also the approximate effect of campaign activity _meta_end_dot_

 clinton will probably have more money relative to obama to spend in texas and ohio than she spent in maryland and virginia _meta_end_dot_

 on the other hand obama will have more time to concentrate on these states than he did maryland and virginia _meta_end_dot_

 so the campaign effects in maryland and virginia could indicate what we might expect in ohio and possibly texas _meta_end_dot_

 first the bad news for obama supporters _meta_end_dot_

 he s likely to have a rough time in appalachia _meta_end_dot_

 as i discussed yesterday before the polls closed his performance in far western maryland and in the mountains of virginia west of i _meta_number_ref_ would be a good indication of how he may perform in southeastern ohio and in the later contests in west virginia and kentucky _meta_end_dot_

 obama was slaughtered in these counties _meta_end_dot_

 in western maryland and the virginia counties west of i _meta_number_ref_ clinton won by margins of _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ or better _meta_end_dot_

 in buchanan county in the far southwest part of the state on the wv border obama only pulled in _meta_percent_ref_ of the vote _meta_end_dot_

 the good news for obama is that overall he did extremely well with just about every major voting demographic _meta_end_dot_

 both texas and ohio are open primaries so his ability to collect votes from independents will be important _meta_end_dot_

 in maryland he won _meta_percent_ref_ of the independent vote and in virginia it was _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 in virginia he also won of the republican vote in maryland he won _meta_percent_ref_ of the black vote in virginia _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 in maryland he narrowly won the white male vote in virginia he won it solidly _meta_end_dot_

 he won approximately _meta_percent_ref_ of the union vote in both states _meta_end_dot_

 in maryland they split white voters under _meta_number_ref_ in virginia he won them solidly _meta_end_dot_

 they split latinos _meta_end_dot_

 and with a large white catholic vote in ohio and later on in pennsylvania it should encourage the obama campaign that they split white catholics _meta_end_dot_

 about the only encouraging news for clinton is that she posted huge margins with white women democrats and they appear to have made up a sizeable chunk of the electorate _meta_end_dot_

 in pennsylvania s close primary if the race goes that far white women democrats could be her trump card _meta_end_dot_

 without access to crosstabs it s a bit of guesswork but it appears that clinton probably won by margins of over _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ among white women who are democrats _meta_end_dot_

 women made up _meta_percent_ref_ of the electorate in virginia and _meta_percent_ref_ in maryland _meta_end_dot_

 for all the mutterings from clinton supporters and even infamously for a short time bill clinton himself about how barack obama is doing well because of black voters it s just as accurate to say that if it weren t for white women especially if they re democrats hillary clinton wouldn t still be around in this contest _meta_end_dot_

 the trouble for her is that all the other demographic groups appear to be shifting toward barack obama _meta_end_dot_

 her task for ohio and texas is to hold on to her initial strength _meta_end_dot_

 in the struggle between unmovable object vs unstoppable force it looks like the odds favor the unstoppable force _meta_end_dot_
