  so huckabee crushed mccain in kansas earlier today _meta_end_dot_

 exit polls in louisiana say he should win and the early results give him a _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ lead with _meta_percent_ref_ reporting _meta_end_dot_

 and it s pretty much neck and neck in washington right now with _meta_number_ref_ percent reporting _meta_end_dot_

 huckabee sweep _meta_end_question_

 that would be hilarious _meta_end_dot_
