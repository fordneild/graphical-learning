  why would anyone knowing the stakes seek unilateral disarmament this election cycle _meta_end_question_

 the answer should ve been no _meta_end_dot_

 look no one gives a shit if obama takes public financing or not _meta_end_dot_

 the edwards campaign thought they d get brownie points for opting in during the primary and other than me criticizing them for it they heard crickets _meta_end_dot_

 and that was among democrats who supposedly care about this sort of thing _meta_end_dot_

 this is such a process story with zero relevance to the public that there s no benefit to be gained by taking public financing unless you can t raise it as fast as your opponent _meta_end_dot_

 then you do whatever you can to try and goad your opponent to join you by opting in _meta_end_dot_

 mccain can t hope to raise anywhere near what obama raises online every time he yawns _meta_end_dot_

 so why give mccain the option of financial parity _meta_end_question_

 obama should say right now that he s decided to opt out _meta_end_dot_

 he s empowered hundreds of thousands to become financially vested in his campaign and it would be undemocratic to deny them that option _meta_end_dot_

 big money in politics is a problem when corporate interests fund a candidate _meta_end_dot_

 in this case it s regular people _meta_end_dot_

 let mccain squawk _meta_end_dot_

 if obama gets out and mccain follows that lead and also opts out then it s a moot point _meta_end_dot_

 if obama gets out and mccain doesn t and then tries to make an issue out of it who cares _meta_end_question_

 no one will know what the heck he is talking about while hard core republicans will be reminded every time how much they hate mccain for his position on campaign finance reform _meta_end_dot_

 this is the biggest non issue of a campaign _meta_end_dot_

 it s best for obama to make that decision now and move on to more important things _meta_end_dot_
