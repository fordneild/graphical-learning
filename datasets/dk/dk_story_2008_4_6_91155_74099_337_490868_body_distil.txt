  you gotta love this headline unless you re a republican _meta_end_dot_

 aides struggle to sort out his promises _meta_end_question_

 oy _meta_end_dot_

 see he s got a problem _meta_end_dot_

 his proposals don t make much sense _meta_end_dot_

 and therein lies mccain s problem _meta_end_dot_

 you can t move toward more coverage without violating mccain s conservative principles _meta_end_dot_

 see mccain doesn t really know a lot about complicated things like sunni vs shi a or condoms and hiv and he sure as hell doesn t understand his own health care proposals _meta_end_dot_

 interestingly in this case neither does his aides _meta_end_dot_

 in a nutshell the mccain plan focuses much more on cost than access _meta_end_dot_

 similar to bush mccain wants to move the burden of insurance from employers to individuals and let the market work it out _meta_end_dot_

 this analysis comes from the health care policy and marketplace review where bob laszewski has asked tough questions of all the candidate plans and to further expand the part about the mccain tax credit one of the intriguing things about the mccain proposal is that it gets more points for cost containment or if you prefer cost shifting than for availability no way is it universal thus the reviewer correctly assumes that s because health care costs are just as important to voters as access if you re a republican _meta_end_dot_

 of course there s not as many of those these days so that puts mccain at a disadvantage _meta_end_dot_

 in any case we re brought back to mccain s stumbling on pre existing conditions and as this kaiser summary notes also brings us to ron wyden s s _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ healthy americans act which mandates enrollment a few exemptions for religious reasons or has insurance already in a state private plan that entices people away from employer based coverage _meta_end_dot_

 this oregonian editorial discusses the relationship between wyden s plan and the democratic candidate s position emphasizing the appeal of expanded coverage which mccain s lacks _meta_end_dot_

 and a reminder from here in ct as to the whys of health care reform so in the end mccain stumbles on the pre existing condition access piece there are other bills pending to address that from steve kagen and joe courtney while clinton and obama will be pushed to discuss mandates or lack of same and cost containment _meta_end_dot_

 the presidential candidates aren t promising affordable increased access reform because it s tough to have both _meta_end_dot_

 but according to the numbers graph from kaiser edu the more accessible is going to need to be at least as prominent as the more affordable and therefore mccain s position on pre existing conditions is not tenable and will not last regardless of how his aides try to dig him out of the hole he s in _meta_end_dot_
