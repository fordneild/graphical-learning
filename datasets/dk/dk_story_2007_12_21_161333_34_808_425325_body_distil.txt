  that s about the kindest possible interpretation of huckabee s latest remarks about guantanamo _meta_end_dot_

 huckabee must have sized up romney a candidate almost perfectly unencumbered by actual beliefs or principles and decided it was time to swipe his defining characteristic _meta_end_dot_

 so less than three weeks after he called for gitmo to be closed huckabee is back to saying that the prisoners are being mollycoddled there _meta_end_dot_

 just think of it _meta_end_dot_

 huckabee visits a facility where psychological intimidation is the norm where huge proportions of prisoners are held in solitary confinement where not a single prisoner has ever been put on trial and what he takes away is the cost of their meals _meta_end_question_

 this is the republicans idea of a man of vision _meta_end_question_

 there s a rhetorical bait and switch worthy of george bush _meta_end_dot_

 critics of guantanamo prison in huckabee s world are fixated upon its location rather than what is objectionable about it _meta_end_dot_

 and you don t try to determine whether the men held there are terrorists you just assume it until they can prove the negative in all those trials that never seem to occur _meta_end_dot_

 l ess than three weeks ago huckabee took the opposite approach to drawing a contrast between himself and romney the candidate who famously wants to double the number of prisoners being tortured at gitmo _meta_end_dot_

 given that all the other republican candidates think their base voters can t get enough of torture you might have been excused for thinking at the time that huckabee was revealing some actual principles _meta_end_dot_

 that is if you had ignored the horse race element and the fact that in june huckabee had come down firmly against closing guantanamo _meta_end_dot_

 who the heck knows what huckabee believes _meta_end_dot_

 his remarks to wolf blitzer in june were boilerplate republican scare mongering masquerading as statesmanship _meta_end_dot_

 in early december huckabee meant no more than romney doesn t know any retired generals and today _meta_end_question_

 today huckabee is conveying the critical information that he really is the baddest guy in town _meta_end_dot_

 there s no mistaking the echo of texas governor george bush who also took great pride in his death penalty credentials _meta_end_dot_

 huck s the guy who executes criminals rather than fancy footing around trying to rehabilitate them _meta_end_dot_

 that s more than tough _meta_end_dot_

 that s huckabee tough _meta_end_dot_
