  i was right _meta_end_dot_

 there were enough votes in orleans and east baton rouge to get obama past a _meta_number_ref_ point victory _meta_end_dot_

 very nicely done _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ percent of precincts reporting and with that i m going to bed _meta_end_dot_

 night everyone _meta_end_dot_

 oh and looking at the maine democratic party s caucus information it looks like they re scheduled throughout the day tomorrow some as late as _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ p m _meta_end_dot_

 et _meta_end_dot_

 so i wouldn t expect results until after that _meta_end_dot_
