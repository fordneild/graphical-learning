  the first presidential forum on global warming and america s energy future is just getting ready to start in los angeles _meta_end_dot_

 rather than handling this as a gotcha debate each candidate participating will be given half an hour to speak on issues related to energy and the environment _meta_end_dot_

 first up will be dennis kucinich followed by hillary clinton and then john edwards _meta_end_dot_

 kucinich is expected to start speaking a bit after _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ pst at which time i ll start liveblogging using grist s webcast to listen in _meta_end_dot_

 because my web connection is slow and prone to failure i may fall behind the comments but i ll try to catch up _meta_end_dot_

 update _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ by devilstower i ve promoted hekebolos live blog thread _meta_end_dot_

 please go there for updates on the forum _meta_end_dot_

 better to depend on people who are actually there than my bad net connection _meta_end_exclamation_

 update _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ by devilstower want to join your own debate on energy and the environment _meta_end_question_

 jerome a paris has a diary up to talk about the next iteration of the energize america plan _meta_end_dot_

 much of the plan holds up very well but like any discussion of energy that started two years ago the information we ve seen recently makes some of our previous ideas look not bold enough _meta_end_dot_

 go in and give the plan some fresh blood _meta_end_exclamation_
