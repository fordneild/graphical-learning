  so today the blue majority sites dkos swing state project and open left added barack obama to our actblue fundraising page _meta_end_dot_

 all three sites held votes of their readership _meta_end_dot_

 daily kos passed the super majority threshold a few weeks ago ssp and open left did it yesterday _meta_end_dot_

 it s clear our communities have become heavily pro obama especially as clinton s only path to victory is via coup by super delegate and civil war and she doesn t give a damn _meta_end_dot_

 bowers gives his four reasons for the move those are pretty solid reasons _meta_end_dot_

 for me the third and fourth are pretty much _meta_percent_ref_ of the reason i decided to begin aggressively supporting obama after spending most of this cycle either uncommitted pro dodd or soft obama _meta_end_dot_

 remember we re looking for _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ donors by the end of the quarter so we ve got _meta_number_ref_ to go _meta_end_dot_

 and aside from obama we ve got some great house and senate candidates on our blue majority page _meta_end_dot_

 we didn t notch victories like donna edwards and bill foster this year by slacking and sitting things out _meta_end_dot_

 we change our country one candidate at a time and we ve got great ones _meta_end_dot_

 so chip in what you can _meta_end_dot_

 even _meta_dollor_ref_ helps _meta_end_dot_

 two is a start but we ve got lots more to go _meta_end_dot_

 so join the _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ who have already chipped in for a bluer majority this cycle _meta_end_dot_
