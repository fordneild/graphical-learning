  this is just an aside but one of the things that has struck me about the republican candidates this season is just how dismal their speeches have all been _meta_end_dot_

 case in point the romney religion speech where he announced that freedom requires religion the problem with that line isn t that it s somehow offensive the problem is that it s embarrassingly ridiculous _meta_end_dot_

 you might as well say freedom requires peanut butter or religion requires roller skates and it d make as much sense _meta_end_dot_

 it may pander to some particularly odd headed religious base yes but at the price of making romney look like an intellectual dunderhead willing to say anything that sounds good _meta_end_dot_

 and that s completely unnecessary _meta_end_dot_

 he could have said religion requires freedom left it at that and it d be a defensible and noble sounding position and the speech would have been every bit as patronizing and kowtowing _meta_end_dot_

 but freedom requires religion ugh that s just historically philosophically and logically silly _meta_end_dot_

 it sounds like a flub not a planned line _meta_end_dot_

 so who is that supposed to appeal to seriously _meta_end_question_

 why go for the line that just plain looks foolish and in a highly anticipated highly crafted highly agonized over and once delivered highly disappointing and irrelevant speech _meta_end_question_

 who put that dumb line in there _meta_end_question_

 how did it sneak by the vetting process _meta_end_question_

 is that really the best case they could make for his position which is roughly um religion is good _meta_end_dot_

 i like it i t used to be even as recently as a few years ago that republicans were much better at abject groveling to their base without making themselves look quite so idiotic in the process _meta_end_dot_

 this year the environment has turned much more into a no holds barred circus of pandering _meta_end_dot_

 their debates quickly devolved into truly embarrassing things to watch as each candidate prostitutes themselves for the most hardcore far right applause lines apparently from watching they re all operating under the assumption that there s absolutely nobody in the evaporating republican base farther left than grover norquist james dobson or eric rudolph _meta_end_dot_

 it s like watching competing bands of elephants gore each other in fights over a rapidly shrinking watering hole torture is great _meta_end_exclamation_

 double gitmo _meta_end_exclamation_

 we hate brown people _meta_end_exclamation_

 and muslims _meta_end_exclamation_

 and gays _meta_end_exclamation_

 so what happened to all the noonanesque republican speechwriters who could be counted on to polish up any turd of a concept into a pretty looking prize with flowery speech and subtle dog whistle phrasings _meta_end_question_

 are they sitting this one out _meta_end_question_

 have they all left to cash in on the book racket _meta_end_question_

 or is it just the case that they can t squeeze blood from a stone and this particular set of candidates are as inspiring and multidimensional as well stones _meta_end_question_

 don t know and it s probably only a temporary phenomenon i m sure once the general heats up we ll begin to see the usual republican speechcrafting the finely honed bullcrapping that gave us healthy forests and clean skies and enhanced interrogation and the three pointed nonsensical axis of evil _meta_end_dot_

 but in the meantime i m thankful for small favors like the fact that the republicans are so busy with elaborate sucking up to their base that they don t even care that they sound completely nutty _meta_end_dot_

 and in ways easily documented for posterity _meta_end_dot_

 freedom requires religion _meta_end_dot_

 good grief _meta_end_dot_

 honestly who writes this stuff _meta_end_question_
