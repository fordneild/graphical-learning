  it s getting pretty darn tight at the top _meta_end_dot_

 view the latest polls and the composite poll of the polls in iowa new hampshire nevada and south carolina _meta_end_dot_

 the top tier _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 hillary clinton another rough week and there aren t many more until the first votes are cast _meta_end_dot_

 she s facing a surging obama in iowa and new hampshire and even south carolina is starting to close with most polling done before the oprah event _meta_end_dot_

 hillary still has the big lead in nevada but that state has become quite irrelevant this campaign _meta_end_dot_

 in the news her new hampshire co chair billy shaheen was forced to resign after wondering whether obama had been a drug dealer a charge so tactless classless and politically unwise that we must hope it doesn t rub off on his wife s critical senate race _meta_end_dot_

 further creating problems for her new hampshire image four staffers were caught sockpuppeting blue hampshire _meta_end_dot_

 these aren t the mistakes made by a confident frontrunner campaign and those are certainly not the numbers of an inevitable frontrunner _meta_end_dot_

 so is that enough to knock her off this top perch _meta_end_question_

 i considered flipping a coin but i m sticking with hillary at the top _meta_end_dot_

 obama is coming on strong but with iowa essentially tied i worry about the ability of his young college student supporters to get to iowa to caucus before their dorms are open not to mention their lack of caucusing experience which killed dean in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 all else being equal including the poll numbers this might be enough to give iowa to hillary _meta_end_dot_

 and with iowa the rest of the states are still tight enough that obama could take a mortal blow _meta_end_dot_

 i don t think hillary is long for the top slot but she holds on by a hair for another week _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 barack obama you know things are going well when it s a good thing you re accused of being a drug dealer _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 john edwards he s polling third in iowa but close enough that his reputedly solid ground game should keep him in it _meta_end_dot_

 if hillary and barack go nuclear on each other he could pull a kerry and slip in _meta_end_dot_

 however so far only clinton seems to be going nuclear _meta_end_dot_

 and the more voters look for an anti clinton the less well he does _meta_end_dot_

 obama seems to be locking up that constituency _meta_end_dot_

 the second tier none _meta_end_dot_

 the rest the rest of the field is now inconsequential _meta_end_dot_

 their only relevance is who their supporters will select as their second choice in iowa _meta_end_dot_

 bill richardson chris dodd joe biden dennis kucinich and mike gravel disclaimer in the daily kos straw poll wednesday i voted for obama not because i actively support him but because he was the only candidate left after a process of elimination _meta_end_dot_

 i d be happy with any of our candidates except biden kucinich or gravel _meta_end_dot_

 still this obviously means that i ve been bought and paid for because i obviously can t think for myself without a few greenbacks slipped into my wallet _meta_end_dot_
