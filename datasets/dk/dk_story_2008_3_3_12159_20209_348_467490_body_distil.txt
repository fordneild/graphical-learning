  the other day i reported on a troubling new executive order from george bush _meta_end_dot_

 it effectively neuters the intelligence oversight board which was created after the fall of nixon to serve as a watchdog against illegal intelligence activities and by extension an out of control executive branch _meta_end_dot_

 on friday without explanation bush stripped the iob of many of its core powers and duties _meta_end_dot_

 for example until bush s reform the iob had the duty to report any suspected unlawful activities directly to the attorney general _meta_end_dot_

 now however iob cannot get word of illegalities to the doj unless the president and director of national intelligence choose to convey that information on behalf of the board _meta_end_dot_

 in general the iob has been transformed from investigator to a passive observer a mere recipient of administration reports about its own wrongdoing _meta_end_dot_

 it s obvious that bush does not want to permit the iob to function as an independent check upon the executive branch _meta_end_dot_

 but why did he act now to neuter the iob _meta_end_question_

 bush was successful for years in marginalizing the iob making it along with other internal review mechanisms ineffective in the words of sen _meta_end_dot_

 leahy _meta_end_dot_

 for the first two years of his presidency bush just left the board vacant _meta_end_dot_

 subsequently he packed the iob like its parent board the pfiab with plenty of cronies and incompetents _meta_end_dot_

 the four current members of the iob include bush s close friend former commerce secretary don evans his former economic advisor stephen friedman and arthur culvahouse a white house counsel from the iran contra era with ties also to dick cheney _meta_end_dot_

 so you wouldn t think bush had much to fear from this tame board _meta_end_dot_

 and indeed even after the iob finally got some personnel in _meta_number_ref_ it continued for years to send no reports of violations to the justice department _meta_end_dot_

 all of this might suggest that the new executive order was designed to prevent the iob from re emerging as an effective oversight body under a future president _meta_end_dot_

 it s in line with the long term strategy of cheney and david addington to destroy all the checks upon presidential powers that were put in place after nixon s disgrace _meta_end_dot_

 permanently neutering the iob would be an essential part of the campaign to bolster a unitary executive _meta_end_dot_

 yet there could be more to this issue as well _meta_end_dot_

 for the iob started to show a pulse last spring after having sat for years upon hundreds of cases of apparent government violations of the law _meta_end_dot_

 it s possible then that last year this congressional report of iob nonfeasance publicly humiliated the board into starting to do its job again _meta_end_dot_

 that could cause problems for the bush administration especially if as in _meta_number_ref_ the iob planned during the spring of this year to forward a set of reports about legal violations this time those dating from _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 that might include any number of details related to warrantless wiretapping or potentially even the politicization of the justice department _meta_end_dot_

 it s very hard to see in any case why a highly politicized attorney general such as michael mukasey would want to have hot potatoes dumped in his lap this spring by means of a report from the iob _meta_end_dot_

 last july alberto gonzales got into difficulties with the senate judiciary committee over previous testimony that turned out to be false _meta_end_dot_

 it involved _meta_number_ref_ reports gonzales had received of improper fbi wiretaps reports that the iob also received _meta_end_dot_

 sen _meta_end_dot_

 leahy asked gonzales to explain why he had earlier pretended that no such violations ever occurred _meta_end_dot_

 gonzales response to the committee became a further embarrassment _meta_end_dot_

 he claimed that illegal violations are not necessarily significant just because the iob is notified of them _meta_end_dot_

 he went on to say that he d make sure to pay more attention to such reports in the future _meta_end_dot_

 so it looks as if the iob was being prodded and pushed last summer however reluctantly back into a more active and visible role in investigating and reporting illegal intelligence activities _meta_end_dot_

 it could be why at that very time dana perino announced that the white house was thinking of curtailing iob duties _meta_end_dot_

 the white house s argument makes no sense of course _meta_end_dot_

 inspectors general are not a new invention indeed the iob was tasked with overseeing them _meta_end_dot_

 nor is the dni independent of the administration _meta_end_dot_

 the iob was created specifically to bring outside oversight to the executive branch s intelligence activities something an intelligence director cannot do _meta_end_dot_

 last summer this wh proposal to curtail the iob was greeted with dismay _meta_end_dot_

 and that is basically what bush has done with his new executive order _meta_end_dot_

 it was unnecessary _meta_end_dot_

 it was controversial _meta_end_dot_

 the rationalizations offered for it make little sense _meta_end_dot_

 it comes not long after the iob sprang back to life and threatened to cause difficulties for some of bush s pet surveillance programs _meta_end_dot_

 and the eo was rolled out on a friday afternoon without explanation just as bush headed off to texas _meta_end_dot_

 i d say there are some questions to be answered about why this reform and why now _meta_end_dot_

 there s also the greater question will congress roll over for this latest power grab _meta_end_question_
