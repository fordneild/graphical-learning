  for all the talk of freedom that the paulbots claim to believe in they sure as heck have been silent on the horrible fisa bill we re fighting to fix in the senate right now _meta_end_dot_

 same for ron paul _meta_end_dot_

 why the silence _meta_end_question_

 and the cato people and the libertarian publications like reason where are they _meta_end_question_

 here we are engaged in a huge civil liberties issue and progressives are being forced to fight this thing alone _meta_end_dot_

 it s easy to talk about liberty _meta_end_dot_

 it s much more impressive to actually do something about it _meta_end_dot_
