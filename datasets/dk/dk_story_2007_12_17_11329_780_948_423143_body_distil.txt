  earlier i blogged a piece based on a hillary clinton response to a question about her iran vote _meta_end_dot_

 on first reading the sentence structure looks like she accuses obama and edwards of coddling hamas and hezbollah _meta_end_dot_

 as pointed out in the comments it was just poor sentence structure or maybe bad copyediting and so that interpretation was incorrect _meta_end_dot_

 i quickly updated accordingly _meta_end_dot_

 people are now demanding that i pull the post and in this super heated primary environment there s plenty of venom directed at me _meta_end_dot_

 i won t pull the post and here s why i screwed up and i m not going to erase the evidence and pretend i didn t _meta_end_dot_
