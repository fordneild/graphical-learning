  there s all kinds of terrific horserace news coming in and our chances of substantially increasing our house majority are looking better every day _meta_end_dot_

 a quick roundup first the biggest news in fl _meta_number_ref_ florida republican dave weldon will not be seeking reelection _meta_end_dot_

 on top of that we have a strong candidate poised to enter the race in former brevard county commissioner nancy higgs who steered the commission during the _meta_number_ref_ hurricane _meta_end_dot_

 six term incumbent weldon won with just _meta_percent_ref_ of the vote against an underfunded challenger in _meta_number_ref_ so the prospect of an open seat race here is very exciting _meta_end_dot_

 the district is relatively republican with a pvi of r _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ but it is an open seat and we expect this to be a democratic year _meta_end_dot_

 bush won with _meta_percent_ref_ and _meta_percent_ref_ here in _meta_number_ref_ and _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 rumored republican candidates include state senators bill posey and mike haridopolos _meta_end_dot_

 in addition to fl _meta_number_ref_ we can now put two additional florida seats these ones based in the miami area on the map for _meta_number_ref_ the _meta_number_ref_th district and the _meta_number_ref_th district _meta_end_dot_

 following hot on the heels of the recent entry of raul martinez into the race in florida s _meta_number_ref_st district to face republican lincoln diaz balart we have two more serious candidates jumping in to take on miami area republicans _meta_end_dot_

 in the _meta_number_ref_th district businesswoman annette taddeo founder of a language services company will take on incumbent republican ileana ros lehtinen and in the _meta_number_ref_th district miami dade county party chairman joe garcia also director of ndn s hispanic strategy center and formerly chairman of the florida public services commission will run against lincoln diaz balart s brother mario _meta_end_dot_

 garcia s potential entry has been rumored for months and it s exciting to see him finally getting in the race _meta_end_dot_

 with his service as miami dade party chair he s a high profile name with a good deal of influence in the district and he has a national profile from working with ndn _meta_end_dot_

 the _meta_number_ref_th district is more favorable territory for democrats than the _meta_number_ref_st is it has a pvi of _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ bush drew _meta_percent_ref_ in _meta_number_ref_ and _meta_percent_ref_ in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 diaz balart drew the district for himself in fact when he served in the florida house _meta_end_dot_

 up in new york s _meta_number_ref_th following the retirement of republican incumbent jim walsh democratic standard bearer and blue majority candidate dan maffei has been added to the dccc s red to blue program _meta_end_dot_

 this is most excellent news as the dccc s backing of maffei should preclude any stuffy old albany pols from jumping into the race and will spare us the pain of an ugly primary _meta_end_dot_

 also it tells potential gop candidates to think twice about running in this democratic district as we ll have a single strong candidate with establishment support _meta_end_dot_

 and finally it s wonderful that the dccc sees the same things in dan maffei that we see _meta_end_dot_

 finally up in new york s _meta_number_ref_th district republican randy kuhl who barely hung on to defeat eric massa last year and faces him again has apparently not decided whether to run for reelection _meta_end_dot_

 i guess his highly deceptive flyers haven t been doing the trick _meta_end_dot_
