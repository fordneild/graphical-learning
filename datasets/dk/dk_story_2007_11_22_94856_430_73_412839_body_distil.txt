  it emerged at a time when the traditional aristocracy was fading _meta_end_dot_

 international negotiations that had once been conducted between the titled representatives of monarchs were being replaced by a diplomacy of the dispassionate professionals _meta_end_dot_

 such affairs would no longer be driven by archaic notions of affronted honor or by the lust of individual rulers _meta_end_dot_

 the new diplomacy would be as much science as art _meta_end_dot_

 hard nosed _meta_end_dot_

 mathematically precise _meta_end_dot_

 it would be realpolitik _meta_end_dot_

 and after a century of advocating realistic approaches realistic goals and realistic measures this philosophy has generated a world that is tragically and maybe even irrevocably schizophrenic in its approach to international relations _meta_end_dot_

 the trouble with the realism in realpolitik is that it s little but an acceptance of cynicism _meta_end_dot_

 under the disguise of being realistic governments can not only refuse to be swayed by honor but can justify any action at all _meta_end_dot_

 practitioners of realpolitik sadly shake their heads and discard the idea of morality as a force in international relations _meta_end_dot_

 it s an invitation to view the world as a mechanical system free of human obligations a series of nodes connected by rubber bands of power the importance of each limited only by it s ability to pull _meta_end_dot_

 you don t have to be a minion of the bush or nixon administration to make such calculations _meta_end_dot_

 it s woven into all our lives so thoroughly that anyone can be an agent of realpolitik _meta_end_dot_

 listen to this conversation with ted koppel on the resemblence between the shah of iran and pervez musharraf _meta_end_dot_

 after drawing some parallels koppel moves on to what happened when some reporters dared to ask the shah about human rights violations across iran _meta_end_dot_

 thirty years on and the lesson ted koppel has drawn from iran is that we may have been too hard on the shah _meta_end_dot_

 if we hadn t pushed for human rights maybe the shah would have been able to spill enough blood and stay on his throne _meta_end_dot_

 that would be good for the united states _meta_end_dot_

 maybe the right thing to do in pakistan is to ignore the jailing of all political opponents the creation of puppet supreme court and a let musharraf torture anyone he wants _meta_end_dot_

 that way we can get on to sham elections next year and declare victory _meta_end_dot_

 good for us _meta_end_dot_

 what s wrong with that _meta_end_question_

 everything _meta_end_dot_

 you want to know why they hate us _meta_end_question_

 they don t hate us for our wealth _meta_end_dot_

 they certainly don t hate us for our freedoms _meta_end_dot_

 they hate us because we are hypocrites _meta_end_dot_

 because we can talk of spreading democracy and upholding rights but do not actually care about those things _meta_end_dot_

 we do not care to the extent that it s standard practice seven days a week and twice on sunday to build a foreign policy based on what gives us the most pull no matter how many lawyers priests journalist nuns orphans families villages nations have to die as a result _meta_end_dot_

 oh we may pretend to be sad about such things but we will put our arms around the killers and welcome them as friends _meta_end_dot_

 let me state this clearly because i failed to do so in an earlier post on a similar subject _meta_end_dot_

 human rights were not created by the us constitution or by the international bill of human rights or by thomas paine or by the magna carta _meta_end_dot_

 the men who created this nation knew well enough the origin of rights _meta_end_dot_

 the rights were not granted by treaty or government they were only recognized _meta_end_dot_

 human rights are innate _meta_end_dot_

 preexisting _meta_end_dot_

 our foreign policy a blatant confession that our morals are far less than skin deep that our obligation to human rights is nothing but talk and we have no real concerns other than our own power _meta_end_dot_

 we will state so openly and often under the guise of being realistic then go back to mouthing the words of democracy and freedom tomorrow _meta_end_dot_

 so long as we base our policy on what s good for us rather than what best upholds human rights we are base pretenders to the legacy left to us by those men who signed the declaration of independence _meta_end_dot_

 so long as we uphold dictators for our own gain our soldiers no matter how individually noble or honorable are bound to an unjust cause _meta_end_dot_

 so long as we nod solemnly over the need to deny others their rights under the pretense of securing our own we are monsters no less than the worst of our enemies _meta_end_dot_

 to cure the national schizophrenia we must accept that human rights and democracy are not separable from our national interest _meta_end_dot_

 we need to put a stake through the heart of realpolitik and instead practice a foreign policy based on a simple principle we will give aid to those who uphold human rights and advance the cause of democracy even if their opponents are more loudly leading a chant of u s a is that unrealistic politics _meta_end_question_

 one thing is for sure it s untried politics _meta_end_dot_

 and after the results of a century of realpolitik anything has to be better than a policy that s committed us to calculated cruelty and produced nothing but failure _meta_end_dot_

 practitioners of realpolitik sadly shake their heads and discard the idea of morality as a force in international relations _meta_end_dot_
