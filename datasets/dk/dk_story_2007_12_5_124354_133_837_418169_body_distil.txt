  i emailed the washington times managing editor about this this is the response i received curl s dishonest use of poll numbers was proven beyond reproach _meta_end_dot_

 his assertions of a bush jump in popularity simply don t match the reality no matter how hard curl tries to mix and match poll numbers to create that impression _meta_end_dot_

 as this email shows however that s the sort of dishonest hackery that gets one kudos and promotions at the mooney times _meta_end_dot_

 and really would we expect any different from them _meta_end_question_

 they are quite simply a right wing propaganda outlet _meta_end_dot_

 what s more amazing to me is the parallel behavior between the washington times and time magazine _meta_end_dot_

 we expect this sort of thing from the right wing rags _meta_end_dot_

 we don t from time magazine _meta_end_dot_

 but in the end there is apparently little difference between the two _meta_end_dot_
