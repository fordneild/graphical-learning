  bumped and updated _meta_end_dot_

 mcjoan as noted below _meta_number_ref_ blue dog democrats in the house are helping republicans try to force through the bad senate fisa bill _meta_end_dot_

 if every one of them votes with the republicans then they are likely to succeed _meta_end_dot_

 if however at least _meta_number_ref_ of those dems reconsider the departures due to death and retirement in the house leave the exact numbers a bit murky and there are some renegade republicans ron paul for instance and vote with the democrats the house has a chance to fix this terrible bill _meta_end_dot_

 not coincidentally _meta_number_ref_ of these members have endorsed either hillary clinton or barack obama _meta_end_dot_

 senator clinton s endorsers from the list are boswell berry ross and baca _meta_end_dot_

 senator obama s endorsers from the list are pomeroy cooper and bean _meta_end_dot_
