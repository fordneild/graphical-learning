  so what happens when democrats offer again to extend the protect america act _meta_end_question_

 you remember it _meta_end_dot_

 when it was about to expire we got doomsday clocks and daily pronouncements from bush cheney mukasey mcconnell and any number of republicans that the terrists ur gonna git us of course what they didn t say is that it was the republican s fault that the bill expired and had it been passed bush would have vetoed it anyway _meta_end_dot_

 as reid put it today on the senate floor and they opposed it again today _meta_end_dot_

 when reid offered a _meta_number_ref_ day extension today under unanimous consent republicans objected _meta_end_dot_

 once again republicans are asserting their ownership of the rankest hypocrisy and fear mongering _meta_end_dot_

 not to mention obstructing progress on what s supposed to be a critical part of our nation s intelligence and security _meta_end_dot_

 but of course they did this _meta_end_dot_

 the protect at t act is more important to them than protecting america _meta_end_dot_
