  in comments to reporters in syria jordan john mccain demonstrated that he does not understand even the most basic of facts about his signature issue the iraq war _meta_end_dot_

 al qaeda in iraq is of course entirely dominated by sunni extremists who view all shiites as heretics _meta_end_dot_

 the rise of al qaeda in iraq and everything it has done there has been shaped by it s contempt for shiites _meta_end_dot_

 the course of the insurgency down to and including the sunni awakening has reflected that fanatical hostility that al qaeda brought to bear inside iraq _meta_end_dot_

 iranian involvement in financing and supporting shiite militias in iraq came partly in reaction to the rise of al qaeda in iraq _meta_end_dot_

 this isn t just a minor slip _meta_end_dot_

 this betrays a profound lack of foreign policy expertise a shallowness so extreme that if the remark had been made by barack obama say it would have called into question his viability as a presidential candidate _meta_end_dot_

 so you should expect the serious thinkers of the traditional media to dismiss the gaffe as trivial _meta_end_dot_

 we are not allowed even to consider the possibility that john mccain is a foreign policy lightweight not with all those splendid foreign policy advisers he s assembled _meta_end_dot_

 update ii ali at think progress reports that mccain made the same assertion last night on hugh hewitt s program _meta_end_dot_
