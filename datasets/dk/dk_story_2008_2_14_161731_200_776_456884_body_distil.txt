  hi _meta_end_dot_

 thinking of writing an article on the fisa situation _meta_end_question_

 thinking of quoting president bush when he says that if the protect america act expires we re at risk of terrorist attack _meta_end_question_

 thinking of quoting republican members of congress who say the same thing _meta_end_question_

 well the president is lying and so are the republicans and if you quote him without saying so you re making america dumber _meta_end_dot_

 before you write your article ask yourself what this means what s that _meta_end_question_

 why it s section _meta_number_ref_ of the protect america act _meta_end_dot_

 too many words for you _meta_end_question_

 focus on this may for periods of up to one year authorize but what about the six month sunset you ask _meta_end_question_

 addressed in section _meta_number_ref_ c except as provided in _meta_end_dot_

 section _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 which was the first thing i showed you _meta_end_dot_

 so when you re writing your story if you repeat uncritically a republican assertion that the sunset of the paa puts us at risk you are a moron _meta_end_dot_

 update a too fast reading of the statute in an effort to beat media deadlines which many of you pointed out _meta_end_dot_

 turns out though that you don t even need to read the sunset provision _meta_end_dot_

 section _meta_number_ref_ authorizes the dni and ag to issue orders authorizing the surveillance authorized by the paa for periods of up to a year notwithstanding the sunset _meta_end_dot_

 that puts the onus on the dni and ag to authorize surveillance before saturday and not on the congress to renew it before then _meta_end_dot_
