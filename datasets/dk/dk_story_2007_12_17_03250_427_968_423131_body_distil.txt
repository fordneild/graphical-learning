  people are outraged about lieberman s endorsement of mccain _meta_end_dot_

 that s kind of silly _meta_end_dot_

 the days when lieberman actually mattered are on the wane _meta_end_dot_

 yes we know he promised the voters of his state that he would fight to elect a democratic senate and president _meta_end_dot_

 yes he backstabbed them _meta_end_dot_

 but really we knew that about him already _meta_end_dot_

 is anyone really surprised _meta_end_question_

 i m quite pleased with this turn of events _meta_end_dot_

 the endorsement means little _meta_end_dot_

 the voters of new hampshire proved in _meta_number_ref_ that they wanted little do with ol joementum with his meager _meta_percent_ref_ results _meta_end_dot_

 but what this does is fully and openly expose lieberman for who he is the disloyal backstabbing ass we targeted in connecticut in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 we were right _meta_end_dot_

 the establishment dems and the establishment media who had lieberman s back despite all evidence it was unwarranted were wrong _meta_end_dot_

 and saying i told you so feels good _meta_end_dot_

 democrats will pick up seats in the senate in _meta_number_ref_ and lieberman s vote will no longer be necessary to control the chamber _meta_end_dot_

 at that point the independent senator from connecticut who endorsed a republican for president should have zero claim to his democratic committee assignments _meta_end_dot_

 he can be free to become the ranking republican member on homeland security but the gavel should be handed to carl levin with little controversy _meta_end_dot_
