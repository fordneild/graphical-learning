  bumped kos the current wga strike is illustrating two competing narratives in american labor history that have always seemed really weird when held up to the light side by side _meta_end_dot_

 the first story line in the present instance is sketched out via a business week q a with a small business expert alarmingly headlined writers strike could devastate small business naturally it s best to frame this in terms of hitting the little guy hard _meta_end_dot_

 but the real clincher in this argument is that these people writers auto workers truck drivers teachers air traffic controllers whoever is striking that day are so absolutely vital to the health of the american economy that they and they alone are going to bring down upon this nation a crash of unprecedented proportions _meta_end_dot_

 billions of dollars lost _meta_end_exclamation_

 hundreds of businesses close _meta_end_exclamation_

 unsung victims _meta_end_exclamation_

 trickle down _meta_end_exclamation_

 entire economy _meta_end_exclamation_

 but _meta_end_dot_

 they re not worth sharing a dime more of residuals with _meta_end_dot_

 or providing a decent pension or health care plan for or adjusting overtime compensation or whatever the issue is in a specific strike _meta_end_dot_

 so which is it _meta_end_question_

 are they borderline traitors threatening the entire economy by selfishly withholding their absolutely vital voluntary labor _meta_end_question_

 or are they overreaching lazy hacks asking far too much for their piddling contributions to the financial health of this nation _meta_end_question_

 if they re the foundation the economy is built upon pay them accordingly _meta_end_dot_

 if they re not quit screaming that the sky is falling if they decide not to show up for work _meta_end_dot_

 or am i missing something here _meta_end_question_
