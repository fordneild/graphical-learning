  yesterday i discussed speculation that that hillary clinton s campaign was getting caught under growing debt while barack obama continues to raise massive amounts of money _meta_end_dot_

 today we learned more about the finances of the two campaigns _meta_end_dot_

 first obama s fundraising one of the truisms of campaign fundraising is that if you re not going after max donors _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ for the primary _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ for the general then the key is getting donors in to the pipeline early _meta_end_dot_

 when someone contributes once they re more likely to contribute again _meta_end_dot_

 we re seeing the confirmation of this belief with obama s fundraising _meta_end_dot_

 he s bringing in new donors but he has hundreds of thousands of donors making repeated contributions _meta_end_dot_

 march was arguably obama s worst month of the campaign _meta_end_dot_

 he wasn t able to take advantage of his shot to knock clinton out of the race by winning the primaries in ohio and texas and yes i know he got more delegates out of texas but he didn t win the primary _meta_end_dot_

 clinton got a bit of a bounce after the march _meta_number_ref_th contests _meta_end_dot_

 then the jeremiah wright story blew up on obama _meta_end_dot_

 his poll numbers tanked in the middle of the month _meta_end_dot_

 his extraordinary speech on race in philadelphia has helped him recover but he probably lost well over a week of momentum so one would expect his fundraising to have suffered _meta_end_dot_

 obviously it didn t _meta_end_dot_

 based on what the clinton campaign leaked to time that clinton didn t hit _meta_dollor_ref_ million and adding in the _meta_dollor_ref_ million raised by mccain obama raised more money in march than both his democratic and republican rivals combined _meta_end_dot_

 that leads us to the second thing about fundraising we ve learned today the clinton campaign is financially screwed from ben smith at the politico people have started asking whether clinton is going broke _meta_end_dot_

 obama is outspending her _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ on tv _meta_end_dot_

 now for probably the first time in the campaign the clinton campaign is refusing to divulge their finances until they re required by law _meta_end_dot_

 there is no plausible explanation for why the campaign would refuse to release their fundraising totals except that the news is dreadful _meta_end_dot_

 releasing her tax returns today which they ve refused to do for months appears to be a diversionary tactic something to buy them a few days of avoiding having to ignore too many questions about whether the campaign is in debt and going broke _meta_end_dot_

 we know why obama might have had a tough month fundraising _meta_end_dot_

 why would clinton s fundraising go in the tank _meta_end_question_

 one obvious answer that savvy people have predicted for some time is that clinton s fundraising was heavily skewed toward people who gave the maximum donation _meta_end_dot_

 when those folks gave their _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ for the primary they were done _meta_end_dot_

 they can t give any more money to her for the primary _meta_end_dot_

 unlike obama she doesn t have a comparatively deep well from which to draw repeat contributions _meta_end_dot_

 another possibility though is that some of clinton s potential donors are just as angry with the divisive and racial direction of her campaign as many other democrats _meta_end_dot_

 if you re from a state that clinton s campaign says doesn t matter why would you contribute to her campaign _meta_end_question_

 if you want to heal rather than exacerbate racial divides in the united states why would you reward her for the campaign she s conducted _meta_end_question_

 it would be great for the party if hillary clinton would admit she won t be the nominee and step aside so obama can focus exclusively on defeating john mccain _meta_end_dot_

 by staying in a contest she can t win hillary clinton is imposing an opportunity cost on democrats by keeping obama from being able to devote his full resources from taking on john mccain _meta_end_dot_

 but even though she refuses to admit she shouldn t continue at some point her bank account may insist that she admit to the world and admit to herself that she will not win that barack obama will be our presidential nominee _meta_end_dot_
