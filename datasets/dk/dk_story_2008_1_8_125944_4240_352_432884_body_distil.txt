  i know in politics people end up living in the moment caught up in that day s big news _meta_end_dot_

 it felt that way after iowa and it will feel that way after new hampshire tonight _meta_end_dot_

 but no matter how strongly you might feel that obama has wrapped things up this thing is still a ways from wrapping up _meta_end_dot_

 jerome is firm in his belief that obama won t win this thing _meta_end_dot_

 a bold prediction no less but one that he backs up with cold logic _meta_end_dot_

 jerome mocks me playfully for talking about the obama surge but it s real _meta_end_dot_

 and the leading indicators are even stronger in favor of obama that is obama is seen as the most electable and after victories in nh sc and nevada that perception will only solidify _meta_end_dot_

 winning elections goes a long way towards convincing people you can well win elections _meta_end_dot_

 the national numbers are evolving in that direction with hillary losing another point today in the rasmussen national tracking poll _meta_end_dot_

 what used to be a _meta_number_ref_ point hillary lead _meta_number_ref_c _meta_number_ref_o _meta_number_ref_e is now a _meta_number_ref_ point lead _meta_number_ref_c _meta_number_ref_o _meta_number_ref_e one a statistical dead heat _meta_end_dot_

 yeah much of that stems from clinton s collapse but the trend will only accelerate as people become more acquainted and comfortable with obama _meta_end_dot_

 in the end i think obama wins this thing and fairly comfortably _meta_end_dot_

 that s the safe call at this point but one backed up by the evidence _meta_end_dot_

 jerome is making a rational and quite plausible case that obama s current success will open him up to greater scrutiny and he ll falter in the weeks after south carolina ending up with a losing dogfight for delegates with clinton and edwards _meta_end_dot_

 in the end one of us will get bragging rights _meta_end_dot_

 or maybe none of us _meta_end_dot_

 politics has a way of constantly surprising _meta_end_dot_

 time will decide _meta_end_dot_

 but one thing s for sure no matter how obama does tonight this thing ain t over _meta_end_dot_

 both edwards and clinton have the money to move forward and clinton s entire strategy at this point is built around the february _meta_number_ref_ states _meta_end_dot_

 so this thing will last at least for that long _meta_end_dot_

 with quick knockouts by gore and kerry the last two primary battles and a bill clinton reelection coronation the cycle before that we ve forgotten what a real primary contest looks like _meta_end_dot_

 you have to go back _meta_number_ref_ long years to _meta_number_ref_ for one of those _meta_end_dot_
