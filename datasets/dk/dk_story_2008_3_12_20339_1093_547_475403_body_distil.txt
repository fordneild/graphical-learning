  no really _meta_end_dot_

 seriously _meta_end_question_

 the perpetrator of one of the most egregious race baiting plays in recent national level politics is outraged to be called out for it _meta_end_question_

 well i m no david axelrod i m just someone who at _meta_number_ref_ years old was thrilled to have a woman nominated for vice president _meta_end_dot_

 but i ll say it if geraldine ferraro is not personally a racist she s doing a damned good impression of one _meta_end_dot_

 racist racist racist _meta_end_dot_

 and while per her resignation letter ferraro has no intention of refraining from further race baiting remarks she s still attempting to blackmail the obama campaign into that apology she wants i ve got news for geraldine ferraro your ideas about campaign finance are almost as out of date as your ideas about race _meta_end_dot_

 in february barack obama had nearly three quarters of a million donors and with _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ contributions already this month he doesn t need supposed big fundraisers like you to keep him solvent _meta_end_dot_

 supposed because it seems ferraro had some trouble repaying her debts from her _meta_number_ref_ senate campaign so i doubt they ll be groveling for help especially after the lavish well poisoning you re engaging in _meta_end_dot_
