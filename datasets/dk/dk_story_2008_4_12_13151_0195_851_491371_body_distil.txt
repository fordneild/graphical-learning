  i usually leave the technical economic stories to more fiscally knowledgeable editors and considering the state of my checking account that would be everyone _meta_end_dot_

 but here s a story on which i feel i can write with equal authority to those who account for every last penny because in this story no one knows what s going on _meta_end_dot_

 not me _meta_end_dot_

 not economists _meta_end_dot_

 not ben bernanke _meta_end_dot_

 not even the investment bankers involved in the story _meta_end_dot_

 certainly not the government because as part of the worship of free markets this is an area that s completely unregulated _meta_end_dot_

 it s called credit default swaps _meta_end_dot_

 just defining a credit default swap can be difficult but here s my best shot _meta_end_dot_

 when you buy one of these things you re buying a level of protection for an investment _meta_end_dot_

 for example say someone has some double yuck rated bonds and is concerned that these things may soon be worth as much as a zimbabwean dollar _meta_end_dot_

 with the right credit default swap you can pay out a small amount over time to ensure that the the bonds still pay out close to face value in case of a default _meta_end_dot_

 so in a sense a credit default swap is insurance you buy for a risky investment _meta_end_dot_

 originally these things were used mostly by banks and large bondholders where they served the purpose of spreading around the threat posed by risky corporate or municipal bonds _meta_end_dot_

 that function is what made alan greenspan and meny economists great fans of swaps _meta_end_dot_

 but there s a downside to a system that allows more investment on the risky side of town _meta_end_dot_

 not surprisingly it promotes more risks _meta_end_dot_

 as the risky investment part of most financial institution s portfolios went from molehill to mountain credit default swaps came along for the ride _meta_end_dot_

 better still around the start of this decade people began to swap the swaps themselves as a new kind of investment _meta_end_dot_

 and to bundle them _meta_end_dot_

 and to sell secondary instruments based on them _meta_end_dot_

 something like a meta investment _meta_end_dot_

 keep in mind that this is a completely unregulated market so investment banks have been free to get creative in this area _meta_end_dot_

 these are very creative folks _meta_end_dot_

 so okay _meta_end_dot_

 people started out making pseudo insurance policies for bonds and other investments then turned those things into another kind of investment _meta_end_dot_

 how big can something this new and this obscure be _meta_end_question_

 here s american public media s marketplace to put it in context _meta_end_dot_

 yes bob more than all the stocks mortgages and federal bonds put together seems kind of high _meta_end_dot_

 and here s the scary thing _meta_end_dot_

 now that we have have so much of our economy s wealth in this odd little instrument that the dollar value would be enough to lay a trail of bills to saturn and back really _meta_end_dot_

 i did the math how much are these swaps actually worth _meta_end_question_

 answer nobody knows _meta_end_dot_

 the original valuations were complex enough _meta_end_dot_

 and with all the flux in the rest of the investment world no one can now tell what s lurking behind all those deltas and thetas _meta_end_dot_

 what we have are banks holding paper that they can t value and system that could come apart like the zipper on a wal mart windbreaker _meta_end_dot_

 the weirdest thing about all this is that credit default swaps in their original form helped to spur the housing bubble by tossing a supposed safety net over bundles of the miserable mortgages banks were handing out and in their investment form they don t do anything _meta_end_dot_

 they don t provide money that companies can use to up production or employment _meta_end_dot_

 they don t shore up the banks _meta_end_dot_

 they don t reflect any activity at all _meta_end_dot_

 they just slide back and forth sucking dollars into a froth of pure uncertainty _meta_end_dot_

 in article after article credit default swaps are referred to as gambling i take that as an insult _meta_end_dot_

 i m strictly an amateur gambler but before i sit down to a blackjack table i can tell you the odds the house has over me to the tenth of a percent _meta_end_dot_

 a halfway decent poker player knows the odds at almost any given moment _meta_end_dot_

 what the banks are doing isn t gambling _meta_end_dot_

 it s worse _meta_end_dot_

 the economist was upbeat on credit default swaps and their benign affect on the economy only a year ago _meta_end_dot_

 still they had their reservations _meta_end_dot_

 bear sterns was the first pop quiz _meta_end_dot_

 no one is sure when the real exam will start _meta_end_dot_
