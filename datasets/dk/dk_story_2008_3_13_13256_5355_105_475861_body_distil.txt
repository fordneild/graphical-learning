  still reeling from the recent loss in il _meta_number_ref_ here is more bad news for the nrcc they apparently had even less cash on hand than they thought at year s end due to massive fraud by their former treasurer christopher ward _meta_end_dot_

 the nrcc didn t have a lot of money to begin with so this is exceptionally unfortunate particularly as it s also a rather nasty and embarrassing scandal _meta_end_dot_

 not an exciting sex scandal involving prostitutes and or diapers fortunately for them but you can t have everything _meta_end_dot_

 part of the nrcc s well documented fundraising woes has been due to a realignment of its fundraising strategy _meta_end_dot_

 since the ascension of tom cole to the nrcc chairmanship the committee has apparently focused on rebuilding its direct mail operation at the expense of telemarketing which had previously made up the lion s share of nrcc fundraising of particular interest in this roll call piece however is one point which indicates a tremendous advantage that the dccc has and will hopefully maintain into the future a significantly larger list of online donors the nrcc is turning to direct mail because once a significant donor file is built it is far cheaper to raise money via mail than over the phone _meta_end_dot_

 democrats however have an even cheaper and lethally effective way of soliciting donations via the internet _meta_end_dot_

 so it is left for the republicans to use everything they have in their arsenal to catch up with the dccc s fundraising advantage this cycle in this case they ve been forced to call in the big dogs like the decider himself _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ million is a good bit of change although i don t think that takes into account the cost of putting together these gala events _meta_end_dot_

 and they ll need every dime of it after dumping _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ million into a losing race in il _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_
