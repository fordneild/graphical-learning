  we re now less than two weeks away from the next special election for the u s _meta_end_dot_

 house in mississippi s _meta_number_ref_st district _meta_end_dot_

 the election which will fill the seat of appointed u s _meta_end_dot_

 senator roger wicker will be held on april _meta_number_ref_ although due to unusual circumstances it is highly likely to go to a may _meta_number_ref_ runoff election _meta_end_dot_

 the primary runoff elections were held last tuesday and democrat travis childers emerged to take on greg davis the republican mayor of southaven in the november general election _meta_end_dot_

 the special election however will be somewhat unique the ballots for this election will contain not only the names of childers and davis but of their opponents from the primary runoff democrat steve holland and republican glenn mccullough as well as two independent candidates _meta_end_dot_

 even stranger the ballot lists no party designation for any candidate _meta_end_dot_

 just the names of six men on a piece of paper _meta_end_dot_

 diarist rbh who wrote an excellent piece on this race last week posted a picture of the ballot steve holland who is friendly with fellow democrat childers wants to be removed from the ballot to give childers the best shot in the special and is apparently willing to go to court to have his name removed with such a crowded and confusing ballot i think another runoff is probably inevitable _meta_end_dot_

 this would as james of swing state project notes in an excellent piece on ms _meta_number_ref_ be the fourth election in the district in a matter of weeks _meta_end_dot_

 james has also posted the results of a poll commissioned by the childers campaign which shows him statistically tied with davis with all six names on the ballot included in the poll davis leads _meta_percent_ref_ to _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 if that polling is accurate childers certainly has an outside shot at taking the special _meta_end_dot_

 i wouldn t bet on it it s a strongly republican district which voted overwhelmingly for bush twice _meta_end_dot_

 registered democrats are well represented in the district but a good many of them are strongly conservative democrats holdovers from an earlier era of southern politics _meta_end_dot_

 still childers would seem to be a fairly good candidate to win the votes of conservatives _meta_end_dot_

 again from ssp nevertheless he has underscored the substantial differences between himself and republican greg davis in the campaign _meta_end_dot_

 childers has called for a withdrawal from iraq and supports schip expansion davis opposes both of these _meta_end_dot_

 regional politics may also come into play in this election _meta_end_dot_

 davis base of power is in desoto county a part of suburban memphis in the northwest corner of the district _meta_end_dot_

 historically the city of tupelo has served as the district s base and that is mccullough s home turf _meta_end_dot_

 it s certainly possible that given the bitterness of the republican primary in contrast to the democratic race where steve holland backs childers one million percent that a substantial number of tupelo voters and mccullough backers could switch to childers in the special election _meta_end_dot_

 it would be immensely difficult to win this district even under favorable circumstances _meta_end_dot_

 nevertheless it s clear that this will be a race worth following with a small but legitimate chance for a shocking democratic upset _meta_end_dot_
