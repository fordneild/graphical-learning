  former senator and former republican lincoln chafee has a memoir that won t go down well with the political establishment in washington of either party _meta_end_dot_

 according to scott mackay who saw an advance copy chafee excoriates george bush and republican extremists as well as the iraq war enablers among the democrats _meta_end_dot_

 there s little in his criticisms of republican leaders that readers here would find surprising or controversial _meta_end_dot_

 chafee does say that he should have left the party when sen _meta_end_dot_

 jeffords did but stayed because he feared ri would suffer reprisals from bush and gop congressional leaders just as vermont had after jeffords defection _meta_end_dot_

 he has a lot to say about the rush to war in iraq _meta_end_dot_

 chafee asked for a private briefing with top cia officials about the evidence on iraqi wmd _meta_end_dot_

 and just as robin cook had discovered on the opposite side of the atlantic when he got a similar briefing on feb _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ it was transparent that the evidence was garbage _meta_end_dot_

 chafee also implies that the cia analysts knew that all too well _meta_end_dot_

 so why did any democrats buy this pathetic propaganda being peddled by bush co _meta_end_question_

 essentially it was due to political cowardice he says _meta_end_dot_

 the netroots have been saying this for years though it s interesting to see it being acknowledged by some who had an inside view _meta_end_dot_

 i wonder where these senators obtain their political memories from i really do because they should ask for a refund _meta_end_dot_

 how could they possibly have been unaware that voters did not exact a political penalty from those who d voted against authorizing the first gulf war _meta_end_question_

 this is the worst kind of political cowardice stupid uninformed cowardice _meta_end_dot_

 incidentally the unnamed senator reportedly was jack reed ri though both chafee and reed refuse to confirm or deny it _meta_end_dot_

 chafee remains contemptuous of democrats who helped bush to gin up this unnecessary invasion _meta_end_dot_

 the group chafee admires the most it turns out are the voters of ri for voting him out of office _meta_end_dot_

 that s right he thinks it was the best thing for his state and the nation that republicans lost control of congress _meta_end_dot_

 a shame that all this candor and self awareness came or came out so late _meta_end_dot_
