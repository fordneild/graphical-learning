  at this point we know that _meta_number_ref_ obama will end the contest with the most pledged delegates _meta_number_ref_ obama will likely end the contest with the popular vote tally _meta_number_ref_ obama will end the contest with the most money and greatest fundraising potential _meta_number_ref_ obama will end the contest with the most states _meta_number_ref_ obama will end the contest with the best poll numbers against mccain and _meta_number_ref_ obama will end the contest with the most primary state victories and caucus state victories _meta_end_dot_

 so what s left for team clinton _meta_end_question_

 she has to convince a majority of the super delegates to cast their vote for her so how does she get those supers to ignore all of the above obama advantages in order to cast their ballot for the candidate who is losing _meta_end_question_

 apparently it s a two pronged strategy _meta_end_dot_

 the first is what we ve been seeing this week tear down a candidate who has inspired and given hope to millions by appealing to white resentment and turning him into the black candidate _meta_end_dot_

 it s ugly and revolting but the clinton campaign is banking on it scaring people away from obama _meta_end_dot_

 and by people i mean super delegates _meta_end_dot_

 so the clinton campaign is left arguing that obama because of his lack of experience and his blackness can t win the nomination flying in the face of all evidence to the contrary evidence that suggests that obama unlike clinton will be a map changer _meta_end_dot_

 clinton on the other hand is already fighting last cycle s battle which in turn as jerome armstrong and i mocked in crashing the gate was an effort to refight the _meta_number_ref_ battle _meta_end_dot_

 the second is to discredit the process of the campaign _meta_end_dot_

 you see this over at mydd were jerome refers to the obama campaign as the process powered candidate _meta_end_dot_

 clever i ll grant _meta_end_dot_

 but it s odd to suggest that playing by the rules is supposed to be a bad thing _meta_end_dot_

 that the primary system needs reform is obvious _meta_end_dot_

 it would ve been nice to have team clinton s support in the last few years as i railed against the caucus system _meta_end_dot_

 but you don t change the rules mid game _meta_end_dot_

 you change them after the election _meta_end_dot_

 still the clinton campaign is desperate in hail mary territory thus they re reduced to disparaging any state that didn t vote for her and minimizing the importance of its delegates whether they be small states or red states or states with black people or states with coffee shops in them _meta_end_dot_

 in fact clinton herself makes a curious distinction why differentiate between caucus delegates and elected delegates _meta_end_question_

 they are all pledged delegates and they are all elected _meta_end_dot_

 it may be subtle but the implication is clear delegates elected at caucuses aren t elected _meta_end_dot_

 they are _meta_end_dot_

 something less _meta_end_dot_

 remember clinton can t win based on the math _meta_end_dot_

 the rules the process are her enemy _meta_end_dot_

 the only way she can win is by having the super delegates ignore all of obama s clear advantages a coup by super delegate _meta_end_dot_

 and the way that coup is by tearing obama down and discrediting the process that gave obama those advantages _meta_end_dot_

 but here s the rub the process that gave obama those advantages includes latte drinkers and black people and young people and red state democrats and small state democrats and blue states that voted for obama _meta_end_dot_

 so it s a sort of catch _meta_number_ref_ she needs the super delegates to abandon the winner for her loser campaign but the way she s trying to win them over is by insulting their very states and constituencies _meta_end_dot_

 harry reid for one is tired of her antics _meta_end_dot_

 and as democrats around the country see clinton insulting their states and constituencies don t think they re not taking that into consideration as they mull their own votes _meta_end_dot_

 and don t think the matter of coattails witness il _meta_number_ref_ is going unnoticed _meta_end_dot_

 clinton is in a bad place _meta_end_dot_

 she is behind in every metric that matters and has been relegated to trashing our likely nominee and entire democratic party constituencies and states in order to make the case that she s somehow more electable despite all evidence to the contrary _meta_end_dot_

 unfortunately for her the super delegates aren t all cloistered in new york or in dc _meta_end_dot_

 they represent the united states of america _meta_end_dot_

 and outside of clinton s blue bastions her insults aren t winning any new converts _meta_end_dot_
