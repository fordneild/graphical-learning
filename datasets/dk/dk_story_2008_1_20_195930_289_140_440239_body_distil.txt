  the pentagon is making a big deal about robert gates self congratulatory speech on friday at a south carolina factory that builds mine resistant ambush protected vehicles _meta_end_dot_

 dod has not one but three stories related to this fake event each one gushing about a program that was ramped up around four years later than it should have been _meta_end_dot_

 hard to say which is more outlandish the fact that gates had the gall to trumpet the pentagon s success in quickly acquiring large numbers of mraps or the corporate media reports that provided virtually no context about the defense department s miserable failure to actually acquire these desperately needed vehicles quickly _meta_end_dot_

 here is gates crowing during his tour of the factory it was a glorious success story not one of the news reports about this pr spectacle bothered to ponder or assess how many servicemen were killed or maimed in iraq while waiting for the pentagon to send them mraps to replace their crappy humvees _meta_end_dot_

 what s more these articles barely even acknowledge that any delay occurred at all _meta_end_dot_

 though you d never know it from reading these articles it s a notorious scandal _meta_end_dot_

 in fact it s a double scandal _meta_end_dot_

 first rumsfeld s dod left troops to fight a prolonged insurgency without enough armored vehicles of any sort _meta_end_dot_

 secondly until last year the pentagon virtually ignored the proven mrap technology and preferred to make do with patching armor onto glorified jeeps _meta_end_dot_

 t he military had tested mrap technology already in _meta_number_ref_ and purchased nearly two dozen of the vehicles _meta_end_dot_

 mraps should have been widely available as soon as ieds became a major threat in iraq by the fall of _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 commanders in iraq began requesting more mraps as early as december _meta_number_ref_ and mid level officers and analysts continued the pressure during subsequent years _meta_end_dot_

 in february _meta_number_ref_ marines in anbar province urgently requested _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ mraps _meta_end_dot_

 yet the upper ranks of the pentagon were indifferent or oblivious and none were ordered _meta_end_dot_

 the first major contract to purchase mraps wasn t signed until may _meta_number_ref_ for no more than _meta_number_ref_ of the vehicles _meta_end_dot_

 by that stage at least _meta_number_ref_ soldiers and marines had been killed in iraq by means of ieds _meta_end_dot_

 as iraq exploded in violence in september _meta_number_ref_ the pentagon decided to order another _meta_number_ref_ mraps but just for iraqi rather than american soldiers _meta_end_dot_

 almost incredibly it was only in may _meta_number_ref_ that robert gates made the purchase of mraps a priority for us forces in iraq _meta_end_dot_

 that was after the marines decided they now needed _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ of the vehicles it was after news had trickled out about the february _meta_number_ref_ request that had been ignored and it was after congressional calls arose for an investigation into the pentagon s failure to act _meta_end_dot_

 here is a may _meta_number_ref_ letter from joe biden to gates as far as i know dod has never troubled itself to explain the prolonged failure to protect the troops by giving them the best mine resistant vehicles _meta_end_dot_

 the main reason for both the pentagon s failure and its silence is pretty clear however the white house refuses to permit any bits of reality to intrude upon its own propaganda _meta_end_dot_

 that s something the top brass were willing to play along with _meta_end_dot_

 the pentagon knew it needed a solution for the ied crisis and was willing to shower billions of dollars on a boondoggle program jieddo though it achieved little _meta_end_dot_

 but the joint chiefs damned well weren t going to go to the bush administration with the information that a fleet of armored vehicles was needed in iraq to meet a crisis that cheney co _meta_end_dot_

 preferred to treat as mythical _meta_end_dot_

 a ll the foregoing information was fully available months ago _meta_end_dot_

 so how much of this essential context made it into the stories produced by the reporters who went along for gates dog pony show on friday _meta_end_question_

 not very much as a matter of fact _meta_end_dot_

 here culled from all the published reports is a single sentence of context that s it _meta_end_dot_

 i suspect that a reader who blinked might have missed the lone context sentence provided by our corporate media _meta_end_dot_

 otherwise from them it was almost all happy talk about the something that really went right _meta_end_dot_

 i guess the central lesson of the last six years is that when the defense secretary declares any of the pentagon s manifest fiascos a success there s really nothing left for reporters to do but transcribe type and submit _meta_end_dot_
