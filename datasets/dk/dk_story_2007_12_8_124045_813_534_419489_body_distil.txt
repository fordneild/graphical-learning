  you know things are bad when you lose your top committee ranking members _meta_end_dot_

 republicans are expressing confidence that they ll hold this r _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ district only ten democrats represent districts more republican than this one and under normal circumstances that d be likely _meta_end_dot_

 but these aren t normal circumstances _meta_end_dot_

 the nrcc is broke and the prospects of having to defend yet another seat and a reachable one by democrats can t be making anyone at gop hq today _meta_end_dot_

 and this is still not the last of the gop retirements or vacancies _meta_end_dot_

 we ve already got _meta_number_ref_ republican open seats _meta_end_dot_

 and with a _meta_number_ref_ member caucus republicans are two vacancies away from losing a full _meta_number_ref_ percent of their caucus and there ll likely be many more than that _meta_end_dot_

 meanwhile as we re seeing in oh _meta_number_ref_ right now even r _meta_number_ref_ republican districts aren t safe for republicans _meta_end_dot_

 we win this race on tuesday still a longshot mind you and this stream of retirements will become a flood _meta_end_dot_
