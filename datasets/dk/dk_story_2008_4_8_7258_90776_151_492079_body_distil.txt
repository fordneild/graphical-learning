  while david petraeus and ryan crocker make their latest appearance before congress to wax poetic on the success of the surge let s take a few moments to look at the role the media plays in enabling these mouthpieces for george bush to peddle their fairy tales _meta_end_dot_

 in the deadliest year for u s _meta_end_dot_

 troops in iraq and where none of the key benchmarks laid out by george bush more than a year ago have been met media coverage of the war has dropped to just _meta_percent_ref_ of all news coverage _meta_end_dot_

 and when the media does bother to cover the war they seem to have fallen into the habit of downplaying or minimizing events _meta_end_dot_

 and while they are certainly not the only media outlet guilty of this let s use the washington post for examples of the shoddy reporting we are seeing on iraq these days starting with this article in today s paper found on page a _meta_number_ref_ by the way wrong _meta_end_dot_

 news of their deaths came a day after six u s _meta_end_dot_

 soldiers were killed in other attacks _meta_end_dot_

 is it any surprise that when the grim milestone of _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ u s _meta_end_dot_

 fatalities was reached last month more than a third of all americans thought the number of dead was _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_question_

 and beyond the shoddy journalism recent remarks made by two washington post political writers seems to sum up the media mindset on covering the war _meta_end_dot_

 from peter baker and from thomas ricks that pretty much covers it the war doesn t play in peoria it s boring and besides it s been going on so long it s old news _meta_end_dot_

 but a congressional hearing featuring testimony on how great things are in iraq _meta_end_question_

 that will get wall to wall coverage _meta_end_dot_
