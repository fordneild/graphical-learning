  you know all those times when bush told us things were going great in iraq _meta_end_question_

 turns out he didn t really mean it _meta_end_dot_

 apparently the president s job isn t to tell the american people or the american military the truth it s to tell them a comforting and self aggrandizing lie _meta_end_dot_

 you can t tell soldiers that they re dying for no good reason especially if you expect them to keep on dying indefinitely _meta_end_dot_

 shake those pom poms george _meta_end_dot_
