  well here we are _meta_end_dot_

 with less than _meta_number_ref_ hours to go till the voting starts america s next sacrificial lamb brought to you by fox news and metamucil is as difficult to handicap as ever _meta_end_dot_

 how does one begin to rank mediocrity _meta_end_question_

 how can flawed mortals discern the fine gradation between such closely related species of loser _meta_end_question_

 these are epistemological questions to which i have no real answer _meta_end_dot_

 i m just a political junkie not a politheologican _meta_end_dot_

 that said i have a solemn duty to summon the calves cruelly and canniballistally fattened on lobbyist comped cap grille porterhouses for the upcoming ritual november slaughter for a final pre iowa cattle call _meta_end_dot_

 i like to think that i ve been pretty accurate in my assessments of the race throughout these last _meta_number_ref_ months _meta_end_dot_

 like many of you i saw huck s potential early on unlike most folks i never wrote mccain off as i still subscribe to the theory that republicans like to give the nod to the guy who s next in line _meta_end_dot_

 on the other hand i ll admit that i didn t really think that mitt was for real until mid summer _meta_end_dot_

 i figured that the mormonism and utter lack of any principles scruples or decency would kill him _meta_end_dot_

 shame on me for forgetting gramm s law ready money is the most reliable friend that you can have in politics _meta_end_dot_

 all you folks who like to point at huck s rise as proof that money isn t everything need to look at the flip side romney would be as dead as the magnificent tommy thompson if he wasn t awash in a personal fortune and gop establishment boodle _meta_end_dot_

 and it s that establishment which has really kept romney in this thing especially in the last month or so as mike huckabee and a genuine unscripted chrstian conservative revival has threatened the icy grip that the money wing of the party has on the republican apparatus _meta_end_dot_

 it s been remarkable to see nearly every respectable republican pundit and institution from the national review to the standard to rushbo to countless columnists like will and novak jump on the stop huck bandwagon _meta_end_dot_

 romney isn t any more beloved by these establishment pillars than fred thompson or rudy but those guys are six feet under _meta_end_dot_

 mitt is just the most likely to beat huck _meta_end_dot_

 and if romney falls to huck in iowa and mccain subsequently vaults over him to win nh then the powers that be will almost surely abandon him as quickly as they abandoned america s playa _meta_end_dot_

 mccain will pick up the banner of the anti romney and likely will soldier on to an ugly victory over huckabee and his rabble one that leaves the party broken dispirited and primed for a landslide loss in the fall _meta_end_dot_

 of course if mitt wins tomorrow he s likely to run the table _meta_end_dot_

 and so with that i give you my final pre voting cattle call and consequently i suppose my prediction for who s going to win the nomination _meta_end_dot_

 i m finishing as i started _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ mccain _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ romney _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ huckabee _meta_end_dot_

 after seeing the all out nuclear assault by the institutional republican party on huckabee over the past couple weeks i just think he s going to have a brutal time winning deep enough into february to wrap up the nomination _meta_end_dot_

 deanies who complained about dem establishment aversion to the good doctor in _meta_number_ref_ have nothing on the resentment that must be felt by huck s supporters _meta_end_dot_

 where dean was mildly disdained and pooh poohed by the most beltway of dems the carvilles and richard cohens huckabee is getting viciously ambushed from all sides by just about anyone with any stroke in the republican party _meta_end_dot_

 it s remarkable and bit nauseating for an outsider to watch how instinctive and visceral the reaction is to the threat that huck poses to entrenched gop power _meta_end_dot_

 and if mitt wins iowa i m _meta_percent_ref_ certain that he wins every primary through to the convention _meta_end_dot_

 that said i don t think he will _meta_end_dot_

 i like huck to win tomorrow night if only by a point or two _meta_end_dot_

 while romney has been successful in smearing him over the past couple weeks huckabee has galvanized a truly energetic movement of christian conservatives ready to take their party for the true faith _meta_end_dot_

 and i still predict that we re going to see a wilder effect tomorrow night as crunch time brings out an anti mormon prejudice that doesn t necessarily show in polls _meta_end_dot_

 the media will pile on romney as a loser no matter how close he comes to huck and mccain s upward trend in nh will spike as soft romney voters migrate to the campaign with the hot hand _meta_end_dot_

 from there mccain should capitalize on the establishment backing conferred on him by the two man race to take at least second in sc and fl and to win in the big february _meta_number_ref_ states thus effectively killing the outgunned huck _meta_end_dot_

 a bloodied mccain will accept a broken party s nomination in a disspirited twin cities and as the confetti and streamers fall around him you and i will be able to read the resignation to defeat in his eyes a bittersweet stare belying the forced smile on his lips _meta_end_dot_
