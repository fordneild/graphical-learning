  today s washington post some people claim that democrats will benefit more by having a longer primary even though there s no conceivable way hillary clinton can overtake barack obama for the lead among pledged delegates and there s little indication that superdelegates will want to flip the lead to clinton _meta_end_dot_

 furthermore it s likely that obama will amass a lead of superdelegates by the end of the primary and caucus voting _meta_end_dot_

 so clinton s chance of becoming the nominee are essentially nil _meta_end_dot_

 while there are certainly some benefits of mobilizing dem voters in primaries we re forgoing the opportunity to define mccain early to make a sharp contrast between obama and mccain and put the race away early much like bill clinton was able to do against bob dole as he emerged weakened and broke from a tough primary battle in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 there s an opportunity cost that s not being fully considered by those who argue for clinton to continue her futile effort to become the democratic nominee _meta_end_dot_

 here s what mccain is doing were the obama campaign not occupied with not letting clinton back in the race they could take advantage of the opportunity to define mccain early and deny him the opportunity to try to rehabilitate the image of the republican party _meta_end_dot_

 this is an opportunity cost we re paying by having an extended primary after it s already clear obama will be the nominee _meta_end_dot_

 we re not taking advantage of the opportunity to as i heard one fairly ruthless politico say metaphorically kill him in the crib nonetheless we have to deal with weak arguments like this from ruth marcus in the wapo please remind me how did those elections turn out for democrats that election in _meta_number_ref_ and that other one in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_question_
