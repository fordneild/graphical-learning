  the problem with americans is we re impatient _meta_end_dot_

 two thirds of us want to get the hell out of iraq _meta_end_dot_

 many of us realize that iraq s political con artists leaders will never get serious about political progress as long as they don t see any threat of us forces leaving _meta_end_dot_

 stepping back a bit it s doubtful there ever will be serious progress in iraq because iraq as a unified nation state no longer exists _meta_end_dot_

 but the bush mccain axis of procrastination is content with keeping american troops in iraq forever _meta_end_dot_

 and if mccain is elected that s probably what we should expect american troops staying in iraq forever in six month increments
