  the utter fury so many of us have felt from watching the behavior of professional questioners and the behind the scenes shenanigans of operations like cnn in the presidential debates makes me wish we could persuade one of the megamedia outlets to give or sell progressive bloggers four hours of air time for the first debate between the democratic nominee and the republican nominee when the time comes for them to get it on _meta_end_dot_

 this is as likely to happen as sibel edmonds getting to tell her story on bill o reilly _meta_end_dot_

 it would after all demonstrate to the world that the so called professionalism of megamedia journalist superduperstars is a phantasm _meta_end_dot_

 but despite the patriot act and warrantless spying i m still permitted to dream ain t i _meta_end_question_

 think of the depth of inquiry we could have the gasp _meta_end_exclamation_

 nuance aided by bullseye follow up questions if digby were moderating a panel that included atrios markos chris bowers pam spaulding laura rozen greg sargent david roberts marcy wheeler chris floyd david neiwert frederick clarkson juan cole and christy hardin smith _meta_end_dot_

 a fantasy line up to be sure _meta_end_dot_

 you can argue about the blogger luminaries missing from that panel _meta_end_dot_

 or who i picked who should definitely be off it _meta_end_dot_

 also about the number of participants _meta_end_dot_

 some will say a dozen is just too unwieldy that five or six makes more sense _meta_end_dot_

 ok _meta_end_dot_

 i understand the argument _meta_end_dot_

 but i like the possibilities that _meta_number_ref_ would provide for digging deep _meta_end_dot_

 and the way it could submerge rather than focus on the questioners personalities the way the debates have so far done _meta_end_dot_

 for the second debate between the two nominees _meta_end_question_

 a two hour free for all refereed by a hardnosed timekeeper plus somebody to fill the water glasses _meta_end_dot_

 five minutes for the republican _meta_end_dot_

 five minutes for the democrat _meta_end_dot_

 a twelve rounder _meta_end_dot_
