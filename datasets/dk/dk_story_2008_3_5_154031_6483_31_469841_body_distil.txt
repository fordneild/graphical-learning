  john mccain increasingly is looking like the hapless hubert h _meta_end_dot_

 humphrey of _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 captive to his own partisan support for a disastrous war too timid to stake out an agenda for change passively permitting an unpopular president to embrace him as heir squandering what little was left of his good repute in shabby political maneuvering _meta_end_dot_

 it s humphrey all over again _meta_end_dot_

 mccain is busy tying a dead weight around his shoulders that he imagines is the mantle of the presidency _meta_end_dot_

 the endorsement today by bush went a long way toward sealing his fate _meta_end_dot_

 during the rest of the campaign the president s embrace will become painful paralyzing and toxic just as it did for hhh _meta_end_dot_

 the press conference today gave a glimpse of what it will look like _meta_end_dot_

 the thing that stands out most apart from mccain s cringing presence is how he passively allows bush to dominate the event _meta_end_dot_

 bush jumped on the first question to box mccain in as heir to his iraq policy _meta_end_dot_

 it was in response to a question posed to both mccain and bush how the republican party _meta_end_dot_

 is going to make the case that you re going to provide the change that the voters seem to want both on iraq and the economy ignoring the economy how typical bush gave a rambling version of his fear mongering gwot talk _meta_end_dot_

 finally bush permitted mccain to explain how he would offer voters the change they want _meta_end_dot_

 heh how humphreyesque _meta_end_dot_

 no surprise a chagrined mccain is already trying to figure out how to embrace his president while simultaneously ditching him _meta_end_dot_

 yeah me too _meta_end_dot_
