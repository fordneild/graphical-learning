  to save you all some time the answer is media hack _meta_end_dot_

 today howard takes on rudy sex on the city giuliani paying for sex with judi nathan with the taxpayer s money _meta_end_dot_

 and how does he approach this well documented multifaceted scandal _meta_end_question_

 don t let the quotation marks around the liberal media fool you _meta_end_dot_

 this column is an ode to the manly manliness that is rudy giuliani _meta_end_dot_

 kurtz begins by telling us what time the politico story was posted because after all giuliani did say it was timed as a pre debate hit piece _meta_end_dot_

 he then says that actually howie the newspaper didn t just say he did it they offered irrefutable documented proof that security expenses were billed to obscure obscure being aid to the disabled and the poor city agencies _meta_end_dot_

 but sure let s pretend it was just a claim _meta_end_dot_

 and let s not bother to address the other aspects of this story that have come out in the past few days that mistress nathan was being ferried around by new york s finest even when she wasn t with giuliani that the police were a taxi service for her and her family that giuliani refused to address this issue when it was first raised in _meta_number_ref_ and that no documentation has been produced to show that those city agencies were ever reimbursed _meta_end_dot_

 what we get is a denial from giuliani a rebuttal from politco s editor in chief an explanation from an unnamed giuliani spokesman and then from a named giuliani spokesman _meta_end_dot_

 three to one with nothing from kurtz addressing the validity of the claims made thus concluding the fair and balanced coverage from mr _meta_end_dot_

 media critic _meta_end_dot_

 because it s time to move on to examples of giuliani calling the media liberal ending with if this column is any kind of precursor it looks like the media is coming into this combat unarmed _meta_end_dot_
