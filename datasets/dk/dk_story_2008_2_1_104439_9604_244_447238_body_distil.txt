  who s favored in an election the long time leader or the fast closing challenger _meta_end_question_

 if the long time leader is an incumbent usually you figure the challenger has a solid chance to win _meta_end_dot_

 how might this pattern play out in the democratic primary _meta_end_question_

 hillary clinton has been ahead in the national polls since the start of the campaign _meta_end_dot_

 but all the momentum both long term and in the last few weeks appears to be with barack obama _meta_end_dot_

 in mid october the pollster com average of national polls had clinton and obama separated by _meta_number_ref_ points _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 today the difference is down to _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ and obama s ascent has been significant _meta_end_dot_

 look at the two tracking polls listed in devilstower s polling roundup _meta_end_dot_

 a tracking poll is a rolling three day sample _meta_end_dot_

 you try to get approximately _meta_number_ref_ respondents per night _meta_end_dot_

 each day you add in the previous night s results and drop out the oldest results _meta_end_dot_

 rasmussen s numbers have bounced around a bit in the last _meta_number_ref_ days but their latest _meta_number_ref_ day average has the gap between clinton and obama at _meta_number_ref_ points and that s with only one night s sample without edwards in the race _meta_end_dot_

 while one should not put too much stock in one night s data in a rolling three day tracking poll last night rasmussen s single night sample had obama and clinton essentially even and a look at the gallup numbers from _meta_number_ref_ days ago _meta_number_ref_ days ago and today show clinton s margin over obama shrinking from _meta_number_ref_ point to _meta_number_ref_ points to _meta_number_ref_ points _meta_end_dot_

 in elections with an incumbent it s generally thought that if the challenger is close and gaining on the incumbent in to the final days of a campaign then the challenger has the momentum and is the odd on favorite to win _meta_end_dot_

 technically there is no incumbent and no challenger in this race _meta_end_dot_

 but vice presidents are often thought of as de facto incumbents in a presidential primary _meta_end_dot_

 while she s not a vice president in some ways hillary clinton is like a sitting vice president running for the nomination _meta_end_dot_

 the comparison doesn t work perfectly here as elections with a sitting vice president are viewed in part as a referendum on the performance of the sitting president and bill clinton has been out of office for _meta_number_ref_ years and the sour mood of the country isn t blamed on bill clinton _meta_end_dot_

 well at least outside the pages of the american spectator and in the bloviations of rush limbaugh but as the known commodity running against the fresh face the alternative to what s already known and for most casual political observers barack obama is just now becoming familiar to them hillary clinton is similar to an incumbent or a vice president running for presidential nomination _meta_end_dot_

 so if we accept the flawed but still probably useful model of hillary clinton as the incumbent obama s momentum probably indicates that tuesday s primaries and caucuses should be much closer than one would expect based on the prevailing conventional wisdom throughout most of this nominating campaign _meta_end_dot_

 hillary clinton is still polling ahead of barack obama in most states _meta_end_dot_

 but with obama s momentum and the narrow margins in the polls nationally and in several key states like california it s not unreasonable to think that barack obama could come out ahead on tuesday night _meta_end_dot_
