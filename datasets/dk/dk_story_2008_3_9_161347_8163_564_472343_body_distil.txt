 bush vetoes legislation designed to prevent the united states from torturing foreign nationals he exposes the lack of straight talk from his new best friend john mccain bolded mine _meta_end_dot_

 how can you be a longtime critic of coercive interrogation tactics while backing the bush administration in opposing the cia waterboarding ban _meta_end_question_

 in fact mccain was against torture before he decided he need to suck up to conservatives _meta_end_dot_

 and while he uses beltway logic to try and make a distinction between what the cia does and what the army does other experienced government hands make no such distinction _meta_end_dot_

 as a reminder this was john straight talk mccain in _meta_number_ref_ and this was straight talk mccain in oct _meta_number_ref_ maybe mccain s barbecue buddies in the press will pin straight talkin john down and highlight the doubletalk _meta_end_dot_

 my take is that mccain is confident he won t be pressed on it _meta_end_dot_

 remember mccain s book worth the fighting for p _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ in relation to the keating _meta_number_ref_ scandal he was involved in how about it journalists _meta_end_question_

 ask mccain for some straight talk to explain why waterboarding was torture but isn t now and whether everything else he says becomes inoperative if it contradicts george w _meta_end_dot_

 bush and or interferes with his run for the presidency or prevents endorsements from far right anti catholic bigots _meta_end_dot_

 ask him if he thinks he s being hypocritical about waterboarding as torture _meta_end_dot_

 ask him about why if iraq policy and waterboarding policy are now just go along with president _meta_percent_ref_ his election would not be a third term for bush _meta_end_dot_

 that deserves some real straight talk the kind mccain isn t giving anyone least of all the american people _meta_end_dot_
