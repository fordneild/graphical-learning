  my understanding of mortgage banking is minimal _meta_end_dot_

 there are a few others here and here and around the blogosphere who understand this much better than i do _meta_end_dot_

 but this i get the mortgage industry lobby is winning in its fight to turn around strong legislation that would have prohibited the payment of yield spread premiums to mortgage brokers _meta_end_dot_

 that would have saved a lot of you a lot of money _meta_end_dot_

 what s a yield spread premium _meta_end_question_

 basically if you go to a mortgage broker and ask him to get you a good mortgage deal he takes your financial information and goes out on the market to see what he can get for you _meta_end_dot_

 you go merrily along thinking your broker is working for you trying to get you the best deal he can _meta_end_dot_

 meanwhile he talks to lenders and gets you the best rate he can get based on what you qualify for only get this he s under no obligation to actually tell you what the best deal he can get really is _meta_end_dot_

 instead he can tack on some extra points to your mortgage rate and just tell you that was the deal instead _meta_end_dot_

 and if you agree to take it guess who gets paid the extra money _meta_end_question_

 that s right _meta_end_dot_

 the mortgage broker you thought was working to get you the best rate available _meta_end_dot_

 if a lender says you qualify for a loan at _meta_percent_ref_ but your mortgage broker thinks you ll accept _meta_number_ref_ _meta_percent_ref_ and he turns out to be right part of that extra _meta_percent_ref_ goes to him and you re none the wiser _meta_end_dot_

 sound fair to you _meta_end_question_

 well the house financial services committee in its consideration of h r _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ is under tremendous pressure to let it slide _meta_end_dot_

 what do you think about that _meta_end_question_

 want to tell em _meta_end_question_
