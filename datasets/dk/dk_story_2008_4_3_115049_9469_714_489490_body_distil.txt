  for a race which would not be ranked among the _meta_number_ref_ most competitive in the country the new jersey u s _meta_end_dot_

 senate race has been absolutely fascinating of late _meta_end_dot_

 firs the republicans initial choice for the race millionaire anne evans estabrook dropped out of the race after suffering a transient ischemic attack _meta_end_dot_

 by the end of the month the republicans had found a well maybe not a suitable replacement but a replacement nonetheless in businessman andy unanue _meta_end_dot_

 this was a tremendous victory for hilarity if not for the republican party _meta_end_dot_

 our man unanue was famed for such exploits as showing up drunk to work and was ultimately sacked from his family business goya foods shocking no undaunted unanue went into the nightclub business though his baby aer lounge didn t get the best of reviews ouch _meta_end_dot_

 so as of last week things were looking pretty dark for republicans in new jersey but they ve had a double dose of good news lately _meta_end_dot_

 first there is now a contested primary on the democratic side as congressman rob andrews will forge a primary challenge against the _meta_number_ref_ year old lautenberg lautenberg would likely have coasted to reelection under normal circumstances so a primary challenge can really only hurt democrats _meta_end_dot_

 this is particularly true if andrews makes an issue of lautenberg s age and fitness to serve another term _meta_end_dot_

 frankly i suspect that is the only way he could beat lautenberg who holds a _meta_number_ref_ point advantage in polling over andrews according to the dscc _meta_end_dot_

 the prospect of a centrist such as andrews supplanting the reliably liberal lautenberg isn t especially thrilling but the idea of a contested primary is even less exciting now that the gop appears to have found a credible candidate biotech exec john crowley i don t know that crowley will be an exceptional candidate but he isn t a joke like unanue and he s rich which seems to fit the main criterion the nrsc has for new jersey this year _meta_end_dot_

 and he can only benefit from andrews primary challenge _meta_end_dot_

 as i said i think the only way andrews can close the _meta_number_ref_ point gap with lautenberg is by making an issue of lautenberg age _meta_end_dot_

 if he does so and lautenberg survives the primary crowley will have his dirty work done for him _meta_end_dot_

 and if andrews wins the primary he will have his own problems as the vast majority of the new jersey democratic establishment is supporting lautenberg _meta_end_dot_

 lautenberg should be strongly favored to win both the primary and the general election _meta_end_dot_

 new jersey hasn t elected a republican to the senate since _meta_number_ref_ and lautenberg has won four elections in that time including one over the dream candidate pete dawkins _meta_end_dot_

 nevertheless things look a lot better for the gop than they did a week ago _meta_end_dot_
