  two and a half years ago new orleans was drowning and the crescent city residents were struggling to stay alive _meta_end_dot_

 i am sure there isn t a single one of us that will ever forget the images of helplessness and despair _meta_end_dot_

 the incompetence of the bush administration was on full display as the residents were trapped without food water shelter sanitation and without an evacuation plan in sight _meta_end_dot_

 after several days of inaction and confusion by the bush administration general russel honore was finally given control and the resources he needed to bring order back to the city and more importantly to evacuate the stranded masses _meta_end_dot_

 looking back on those days there is one event that really stood out _meta_end_dot_

 it was the moment that completely shifted the mission of the troops from a law order force to a rescue mission _meta_end_dot_

 it was the moment that general honore pulled into the heart of new orleans climbed out of his truck and immediately started shouting at the military personnel put your guns down as i recall there was a crowd nearby that began cheering _meta_end_dot_

 he was such a commanding figure and it was at that exact moment that the mission shifted and the rescue began in earnest _meta_end_dot_

 this friday general russel honore will be turning over his command and leaving his military career behind _meta_end_dot_

 while many retired generals may be content to spend afternoons on the golf course and the evenings lighting up the cocktail circuit that doesn t seem to be honore s style _meta_end_dot_

 instead he is going to take the lesson of katrina and dedicate himself to keeping america prepared _meta_end_dot_

 it will be interesting to see how he intends to create a culture of preparedness with the threats of terrorism and global warming it is long overdue _meta_end_dot_

 and with his no nonsense style if anybody can help america prepare it s general honore _meta_end_dot_

 in the meantime let s honor the service of general honore by helping new orleans _meta_end_dot_

 they ve come a long way but they still have far to go _meta_end_dot_

 below are a couple of links to organizations that need help _meta_end_dot_
