  i love this community _meta_end_dot_

 every time i ve seen this place faced with a challenge people have come together in an amazing way _meta_end_dot_

 earlier this week i was ecstatic at how the community dug in to assist the women s shelter pretty bird woman house after call from kossack andyt _meta_end_dot_

 another example one very important to me is the way more than one hundred and fifty kossacks have taken the time to call their representatives about the clean water protection act _meta_end_dot_

 a month ago i started down the path of _meta_number_ref_ days to save the mountains hoping to do something about the horror of mountaintop removal mining _meta_end_dot_

 now there are three days remaining and even though i ve missed several days out of the last twenty seven i don t feel too bad about letting my little campaign wind down _meta_end_dot_

 that s because nothing on daily kos nothing worthwhile long remains a solo effort _meta_end_dot_

 there are always others willing to swoop in an lend a hand _meta_end_dot_

 in this case i was far from the first to push this issue _meta_end_dot_

 there are a number of members who have been working on this issue for years dedicating themselves to saving appalachia before the last of the ancient hills is turned to rubble _meta_end_dot_

 so even on those days when i wasn t able to post there were excellent diaries from people like faithfull patriot daily news clearinghouse and a siegel _meta_end_dot_

 if you haven t read these diaries you ve missed some stirring writing astounding statistics and heartbreaking images _meta_end_dot_

 we ve also been lucky enough to have a diary from congressman frank pallone the author of the clean water protection act _meta_end_dot_

 but if there s one diary on this subject i d like to bring to your attention it s this one by first time diarist wisecountyva also known as kathy selvage i m not outing her she gives her name and background in the diary _meta_end_dot_

 kathy has lived through the rapid violent destruction of her home county and when she talks about mountaintop removal it s as a personal experience _meta_end_dot_

 kathy along with many others on this site have devoted themselves to this cause _meta_end_dot_

 they ve seen what happens when no one stands up to these companies _meta_end_dot_

 they re standing up _meta_end_dot_

 you can support them by contacting these congressmen who sit on the water resources subcommittee _meta_end_dot_

 adding just a few of these names to the list of cosponsors would be a huge boost _meta_end_dot_

 write _meta_end_dot_

 and be sure to look in after the break for another important list _meta_end_dot_

 this one shows your fellow kossacks who have taken the time to talk to a representative or two or ten about this fight _meta_end_dot_

 thanks _meta_end_dot_
