  the failure to ratify an oil revenue law highlights two colossal blunders at the heart of the bush neocon plans for iraq _meta_end_dot_

 the administration claimed and probably believed that iraqi oil production would pay for a significant share of the reconstruction costs _meta_end_dot_

 those estimates were always ridiculously rosy _meta_end_dot_

 the day baghdad collapsed to the invading us forces dick cheney said iraq would be producing _meta_number_ref_ million barrels of oil a day by the end of _meta_number_ref_ despite the fact that iraq hadn t produced that much oil since prior to the iran iraq war pdf _meta_end_dot_

 even though recent production levels have gone up iraq still only pumps a little more than _meta_number_ref_ million barrels per day pdf less than it did before the us invasion _meta_end_dot_

 the deeper problem however is that the kurds are cutting their own oil deals because they want out of iraq _meta_end_dot_

 when a people are the victim of a genocide like saddam s anfal against the kurds they won t happily unify with the people they believe perpetrated the genocide against them _meta_end_dot_

 kurds don t see the anfal as uniquely tied to the person of saddam hussien _meta_end_dot_

 they associate it with the sunni arabs _meta_end_dot_

 thus it s not surprising that they don t want to be in a state in which they have to submit to the political wishes of sunni arabs _meta_end_dot_

 kurdish desires for independence are especially strong since they ve conducted their own business and run their own de facto kurdish state in northern iraq since the conclusion of the gulf war in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 with the kurds uninterested and probably unwilling to remain in iraq it s na ve to think that it will be easy if even possible to pass oil revenue laws that will be satisfactory to all groups in iraq _meta_end_dot_

 we can conduct all the military surges we want but we can t make iraqis create and maintain a viable country if they simply do not want to remain a cohesive nation state _meta_end_dot_

 the bush administration bumbled in to iraq destabilized the state and the region and now doesn t have a plan for how to end the conflict and extricate our troops from the battlefield _meta_end_dot_

 this is something i wrote some months back nothing significant has changed in the intervening five months to make iraq a more feasible nation state _meta_end_dot_

 it s a mess we need to get out troops out and it will be one of the most daunting challenges left to our next president _meta_end_dot_
