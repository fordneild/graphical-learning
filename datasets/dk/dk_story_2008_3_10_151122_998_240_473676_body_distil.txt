  earlier i wrote about obama s delegate victory this past week despite clinton s wins last tuesday _meta_end_dot_

 my list was incomplete _meta_end_dot_

 a reader passed on a full list of all the super delegates who announced the last six days their endorsements so that s an _meta_number_ref_ delegate advantage for obama _meta_end_dot_

 as for the elections that gives obama a four delegate victory since last tuesday _meta_end_dot_

 add the four delegate gain out of california after that state s vote was certified and we re up to _meta_number_ref_ delegates for obama _meta_end_dot_

 throw in the four delegates clinton lost in california and that s _meta_number_ref_ delegates for obama _meta_end_dot_

 today we had dnc member and super delegate everett sanders of mississippi endorsing obama so make that _meta_number_ref_ delegates for obama _meta_end_dot_

 so officially obama has a _meta_number_ref_ delegate advantage for the week even before mississippi votes tomorrow _meta_end_dot_

 throw in the unpledged delegate in wyoming who will certainly be an obama delegate and unofficially obama notched a _meta_number_ref_ delegate gain in this week from hell for him _meta_end_dot_

 as that reader noted in his email to me a few more bad weeks like this and he ll have the nomination nicely sewed up _meta_end_dot_

 delegate information from the _meta_number_ref_ democratic convention watch blog update and another _meta_number_ref_ for obama he gains joyce brayboy of north carolina and if spitzer resigns she loses his vote _meta_end_dot_

 the lt _meta_end_dot_

 gov _meta_end_dot_

 david patterson is a clinton person but he already had a vote as a dnc member _meta_end_dot_

 he doesn t get two votes now _meta_end_dot_

 so a net loss for clinton _meta_end_dot_

 oh and speaking of spitzer clinton has already scrubbed her website of any spitzer mentions _meta_end_dot_
