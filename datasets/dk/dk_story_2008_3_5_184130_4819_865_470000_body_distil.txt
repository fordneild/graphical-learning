  an aging john mccain doesn t look so good against either of the democratic candidates _meta_end_dot_

 was that a gratuitous knock against mccain s elderly status _meta_end_question_

 nah _meta_end_dot_

 and get used to it _meta_end_dot_

 mccain s age is a big deal _meta_end_dot_

 from the wapo version but mccain has more problems than that _meta_end_dot_

 we ve covered mccain s problems with his base and the underwhelming enthusiasm of the shrinking gop base _meta_end_dot_

 now this abc and then there s the war wapo and then there s the hugely unpopular george albatross bush abc these are terrible numbers for mccain _meta_end_dot_

 nothing is definitive and permanent and sure it s only a march poll _meta_end_dot_

 also note this poll is adults rvs and lvs this far out is almost impossible to figure _meta_end_dot_

 but some of the things highlighted here cannot be changed _meta_end_dot_

 you can t teach youth to steal from the basketball bromide about height mccain is not a change candidate and iraq opinions are strongly held _meta_end_dot_

 and then there s the economy _meta_end_dot_

 the party in power is going to take a beating for the recession we re in and economics is hardly mccain s strength _meta_end_dot_

 all in all the poll helps brings perspective and echoes the ny times and rt strategies in putting mccain behind obama and no worse than tied with clinton _meta_end_dot_

 no guarantees no predictions but don t be deceived mccain starts behind and the attention garnered by the dueling democrats is not helping mccain any more than bush s endorsement will _meta_end_dot_
