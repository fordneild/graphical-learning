  i can t do it _meta_end_dot_

 maybe it s the cough medication talking _meta_end_dot_

 maybe it s the season _meta_end_dot_

 maybe it s the knowledge that we re about to launch into a new presidency which seems already by many of the most important measures to be destined for either completely out in the open republican insanity or fear spangled democratic timidity _meta_end_dot_

 but i have outrage overload and i can t manage anything pithy to say about the current environment that doesn t involve just climbing the nearest church steeple and swearing at the top of my lungs _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ the wapo publishes completely false smears against obama truly the most poorly premised and written article i have seen since half past forever _meta_end_dot_

 akin to what the swiftboat vet stories would have been if the swiftboat vets had not even been seasoned republican operatives but just some paranoid guy ranting incoherently from his south carolina basement truly the story reads like something plagiarized from the racist human events and rewritten into washington post journalism format just barely enough to make it by the apparently heavily drugged editors _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ rove trying an instance of the great conservative walkback against _meta_end_dot_

 well himself _meta_end_dot_

 claims the democrats goaded bush into the iraq war _meta_end_dot_

 this was apparently not done on a dare or while under the influence of drugs though it was done under the influence of rove style conservative republicanism _meta_end_dot_

 whatever i don t know but this is the sort of insane claim for which tarring and feathering was invented _meta_end_dot_

 can we please bring it back _meta_end_question_

 i know i know i have previously written against torture _meta_end_dot_

 i ve changed my mind _meta_end_dot_

 if you can t torture someone for attempting to alter the fabric of spacetime through the power of their own proclamatory farts then this world is no longer worth living in _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ oh this is wonderful _meta_end_dot_

 no really _meta_end_dot_

 we find out that rudy had the fuckin city of new york provide an official city paid booty call car and driver set for his secret non wifely hump buddy _meta_end_dot_

 seriously he had the city provide his mistress a car and police driver _meta_end_dot_

 and upon learning all of this which managed to stay under the radar for years and years in spite of being trivally easy to suss out and presumably a felony to boot we re sitting here wondering if the media is going to get off their asses and bother to give two shits since they don t have their usual republican faxes telling them how to push the story _meta_end_dot_

 since presumably the republican faxes right now all have to do with whether or not barack obama got muslim cooties from some brown looking kid in second grade which is far more important _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ supposedly intelligent democratic presidential contender hillary clinton says yeah that colin powell is a guy worth listening to _meta_end_exclamation_

 under the apparent premise that the one guy singularly and most famously known for having the most total lifetime opportunities to do the right thing during a complete clusterfuck without ever goddamn actually doing it even once even while every shred of his own integrity got shoveled into george w _meta_end_dot_

 bush s boxer shorts in fact represents the kind of moderation and foreign policy bipartisanship worth the attention of democrats _meta_end_dot_

 no this is what seriously counts as reasonable these days even among prominent democrats _meta_end_dot_

 you don t actually have to do the right thing _meta_end_dot_

 you don t have to do the right thing when given one opportunity or two or five or twenty _meta_end_dot_

 you just have to be declared the guy who seems like the guy most likely to maybe have done the right thing except that you didn t and that s all it takes _meta_end_dot_

 that s moderation _meta_end_dot_

 that s being an intelligent voice among the crew of the biggest ship of fools ever to set sail from the confines of their own hollow heads _meta_end_dot_

 that s enough to get all the broders and god help me clintons of the world saying by golly that s what we need _meta_end_dot_

 after seven years of complete disasterous clusterfuckery the right thing to do would be to have an administration that is willing to take equal parts sensible policy and total clusterfuckery adds them together and we re done _meta_end_exclamation_

 instant reasonableness _meta_end_exclamation_

 and then we should torture half the people we normally do and restore half the rights that should be restored and help half the americans that need our help and get into half as many disastrously mismanaged trillion dollar wars and fix half the budget and indict only half the criminals and the entire washington establishment will come to a shattering orgasmic printed climax in honor of such reasonableness and bipartisanship _meta_end_dot_

 equal parts insanity plus non insanity equals in washington eyes the only approach worthy of respect _meta_end_dot_

 god help you if you try anything more _meta_end_dot_

 because there s nothing you can do to be discredited these days _meta_end_dot_

 and nothing colin powell ever did or pointedly prevented himself from doing will reflect in the slightest upon him _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ joe klein continues to walk the earth unraped by drunken bears _meta_end_dot_

 this is evidence enough for me to doubt the existence of god _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ oh and some democratic leaning military guy asked a question about teh gays at a republican debate thus rending the well constructed fortress of republitude asunder and causing all the petraeus loving patriots of the right to suddenly wonder if maybe military folks might be traitorous opinionated bastards injecting themselves into politics after all _meta_end_dot_

 i mean what the holy _meta_end_dot_

 porcine _meta_end_dot_

 fuck_meta_beep_ref_ _meta_end_question_

 to hell with being polite about any of this apparently there s no point _meta_end_dot_

 to hell with trying to make the press better or trying to keep republicans honest or pretending that democrats are anything more than the battered spouses of their own bunglefucked advisors and consultants and hangers on and punditorial freebased stupidity pushers _meta_end_dot_

 right now i just want to run every last reporter and politician on earth through a cheese grater _meta_end_dot_

 maybe it s the damn season _meta_end_dot_
