  as the vastly underestimated unemployment rate rises retails sales disappoint home sales continue to sink the stock market takes another tumble and the nation s top banks and mortgage lenders huddle together against the storm economists have only one question are we heading for recession or are we already there _meta_end_dot_

 now or six months from now there s little doubt that us economy has run out of steam and unlike recent recessions economists fear that we re going to be a long time recovering from this slump _meta_end_dot_

 why _meta_end_question_

 because we ve taken all the elastic out of the system _meta_end_dot_

 don t expect a lot from the republican s sleepy time front runner john mccain who expects the fed to handle that nasty economy so he can get back to his morning farina _meta_end_dot_

 the republican candidates do seem to realize that the fog of reaganomics is looking awfully tattered in the light of day _meta_end_dot_

 in response they ve generated a flood of generic mock populism when not debating on fox _meta_end_dot_

 unfortunately when pressed for details the republicans have little to offer but more of what bush has already delievered oh and huck s _meta_percent_ref_ sales tax that s sure to get the economy humming _meta_end_dot_

 the next president will inherit from the republicans a nation at war a government in horrendous debt and an economy in shambles _meta_end_dot_

 makes you wonder why so many people seem to want the job _meta_end_dot_

 there are several things to watch out for as the candidates on both sides roll out their proposals for goosing the economy out of decline _meta_end_dot_

 first this really is stupid s economy _meta_end_dot_

 applying more of what bush has done so far shifting money to the top tax burden to the middle debt to the future and regulatory responsibility to nowhere is certain to make things worse not better _meta_end_dot_

 yes small targeted tax cuts aimed at the working class will likely have a stimulative effect _meta_end_dot_

 extending bush s tax cuts will not help at all in the short term and will only increase the damage in the long term _meta_end_dot_

 on the democratic side it would be terrific to see candidates whose solution doesn t begin and end with the phrase tax cuts it would also be nice to see one that wasn t made up of one time expenditures that left the basic problems in place _meta_end_dot_

 the stimulus effort that have worked best in the past involved a good injection of funds into public projects and into areas of the economy that could help reverse the downward slide _meta_end_dot_

 tax cuts don t help if you re not making any money to be taxed on in the first place _meta_end_dot_

 jobs help _meta_end_dot_

 education helps _meta_end_dot_

 a really smart candidate could even look at this economic downturn as an opportunity _meta_end_dot_

 this is a clear signal that the path we ve been on for the last several years was a path to worse than nowhere _meta_end_dot_

 a stimulus packet that included a serious press for changes in energy policy could open the us to simultaneously create new jobs improve the environment and improve national security _meta_end_dot_

 change has been on the tongue of every candidate _meta_end_dot_

 changing the way out energy picture works has been a part of every stump speech _meta_end_dot_

 a need for change in our economic direction is becoming ever more obvious _meta_end_dot_

 now which candidate is smart enough to put it all together _meta_end_question_
