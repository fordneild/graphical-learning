  late last week i blogged this ap article which claimed clinton had picked up the support of three new super delegates _meta_end_dot_

 it turns out the ap was wrong as bean counter extraordinaire chuck todd notes actually make that _meta_number_ref_ supers for obama _meta_end_dot_

 so since march _meta_number_ref_ the delegate count is then there s the super delegate stuff _meta_end_dot_

 todd says clinton has lost seven and obama gained _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ after today s addition since feb _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 i don t know when those additions and subtractions occurred in relation to march _meta_number_ref_ so i can t add them to my little chart above _meta_end_dot_

 but all together it proves once again that real momentum that gauged by actual numbers and results and not what the media tells us is still firmly in obama direction _meta_end_dot_
