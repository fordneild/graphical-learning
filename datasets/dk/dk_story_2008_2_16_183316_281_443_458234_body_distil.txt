  gee they just can t seem to get this stuff right isn t that just so wacky _meta_end_question_

 gosh george w _meta_end_dot_

 bush s administration just seems to keep mistakenly overreaching on electronic spying national security letters the no fly list _meta_end_dot_

 it s all just sooooo unexpected _meta_end_exclamation_

 the good news here is that as the article notes the e mails mistakenly vacuumed up by the fbi were destroyed a procedure known as minimization hmm _meta_end_dot_

 minimization _meta_end_dot_

 that rings a bell _meta_end_dot_

 what was it _meta_end_question_

 oh yeah _meta_end_exclamation_

 the fisa fight in the senate _meta_end_exclamation_

 minimization was a concern because the senate bill pretty much gave the government a free hand to suck up every phone call e mail text message etc _meta_end_dot_

 there is and amazingly enough had to be amended on the floor in order to even approach a proper handling of minimization concerns _meta_end_dot_

 curiously it happened that there was no provision in the new law that said what actually happens if the government oh let s say _meta_end_dot_

 doesn t destroy accidentally captured communications _meta_end_dot_

 senator whitehouse had to try to shoehorn that in as an amendment and along the way had to agree to soften his language from explicitly authorizing compliance reviews by the fisa court down to some mumblings about how nothing in the bill should be construed to reduce or contravene the fisa court s inherent authority to enforce its orders regarding minimization if any _meta_end_dot_

 subtle difference i suppose _meta_end_dot_

 the affirmative power to conduct reviews versus a grudging acknowledgment that a court should be able to enforce its own orders _meta_end_dot_

 but not that subtle _meta_end_dot_

 after all how does any court actually enforce its orders _meta_end_question_

 by reliance on the muscle of the unitary executive of course _meta_end_dot_

 oops _meta_end_exclamation_

 dang _meta_end_dot_

 oh well _meta_end_dot_

 what are the odds of another mistake anyway _meta_end_question_

 d oh _meta_end_exclamation_

 wonder how the new softer minimization language combined with an administration that gives less of a shit about the law and its consequences as the clock winds ever closer to its end will stand up to the government s record of _meta_end_dot_

 well abject failure to act with any reasonable restraint at all _meta_end_dot_
