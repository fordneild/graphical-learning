  every presidential candidate whose health plan rewards the health insurance companies by giving them more business via mandates needs to rethink that approach _meta_end_dot_

 i ve been locked with my own battle with blue shield over what is really a minor still unresolved health issue those who need far more expensive care as they fight for their lives are in far worse shape and people are dying as a result _meta_end_dot_

 a system that replaces the judgement of doctors for that of accountants is inherently broken and must be scrapped _meta_end_dot_

 these cigna execs should be charged with manslaughter or the murder of nataline while a more comprehensive solution to the nation s health care crisis must ensure that a for profit health care system be scrapped for one that puts the health of the people first _meta_end_dot_
