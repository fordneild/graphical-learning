  much attention is given to the spending of the primary campaigns how long they ve been on tv how much they re spending and so on _meta_end_dot_

 when a group comes in and does nasty television ads attacking a candidate that gets attention _meta_end_dot_

 but independent expenditure campaigns on behalf of the primary candidates have gotten very little attention this campaign season _meta_end_dot_

 much of the spending early in the campaign was by the pac s of three organizations the american federation of state county and municipal employees afscme the american federation of teachers aft and emily s list _meta_end_dot_

 a review of independent expenditures by these three groups shows that through the wisconsin primary they spent _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ million in direct voter contact on behalf of hillary clinton _meta_end_dot_

 their spending was concentrated in states where clinton has performed well including some of her biggest wins on super tuesday _meta_end_dot_

 their ability to deliver wins for clinton appears to be fading but early in the campaign through an apparent focus on increasing turnout and performance among women voters hillary clinton s candidacy may have been saved by afscme the aft and emily s list _meta_end_dot_

 before we go further a quick explanation of independent expenditures ie will probably help _meta_end_dot_

 many people have heard of _meta_number_ref_ s which run ads or do quasi campaign activity _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ s operate under limitations however which prevent them from doing what is called express advocacy which is generally any message that advocates a vote for or against a candidate _meta_end_dot_

 independent expenditure campaigns can call on people to vote for or against _meta_end_dot_

 the reason for the difference is the source of the money funding the activity _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ s can be funded by massive donations by individuals or through corporate funds or labor union treasury monies from member dues _meta_end_dot_

 these funds can not be used for express advocacy _meta_end_dot_

 ie activity must use pac money which is money contributed to a political action committee voluntarily by individuals adhering to federal contribution regulations and limits _meta_end_dot_

 the three organizations under discussion here all operate large pac s and all the money they are spending has been voluntarily contributed by individuals with the knowledge that it would be used for electioneering or contributions to candidates _meta_end_dot_

 ie campaign do however have to remain independent of the candidate s campaign _meta_end_dot_

 they can not coordinate activities with the candidate _meta_end_dot_

 communications between them are strictly forbidden and entities like the congressional campaign committees i e the dccc and the nrsc even split their staffs before ie activities begin _meta_end_dot_

 there is nothing nefarious about the work on behalf of hillary clinton done by afscme aft or emily s list _meta_end_dot_

 as i will show in a post later today obama has very recently become the beneficiary of similar activities by other organizations _meta_end_dot_

 as discussed yesterday hillary clinton has generally performed close to what was expected by looking at an average of pre election polls while barack obama has performed on average _meta_number_ref_ points better than he polled _meta_end_dot_

 the places where clinton has preformed best and the states that have given her the most important wins are those states where afscme the aft and emily s list were most active _meta_end_dot_

 sorting through which expenditures were for ia and which for nh was impossible as emily s list didn t differentiate the states where they were spending until january _meta_end_dot_

 but the combined spending of the three organizations in ia and nh was just under _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ million _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ million was spent on electronic media radio and television _meta_end_dot_

 another _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ went to web ads and just under _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ was spent on various production costs travel and polling _meta_end_dot_

 where the three organizations have probably been most effective though is through targeted mail and phone calls _meta_end_dot_

 approximately _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ pieces of mail were sent to potential voters in ia and nh _meta_end_dot_

 from the designations on some of the expenditures and from knowing that mail is often used for more specific targeting than electronic media it appears that much and maybe all of the mail and phone calls went to women voters _meta_end_dot_

 the total spent was about _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ and it was complemented by another _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ in phone calls _meta_end_dot_

 on election day there were reports from nh that the clinton campaign leadership believed they would lose _meta_end_dot_

 even they were surprised by their win which confounded pollsters and led to much speculation about what explained clinton s _meta_number_ref_ point victory _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_percent_ref_ of the democratic primary voters in nh were women _meta_end_dot_

 that was apparently higher than the pollsters expected and could very well be explained by the concerted effort to persuade and mobilize women voters conducted by afscme the aft and emily s list _meta_end_dot_

 the model of some electronic media mostly radio and numerous mail pieces usually six per state followed up with phone calls has been used repeatedly by the three organizations _meta_end_dot_

 this set of activities was used in nevada where afscme and the aft spent approximately _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ in media mail and phones _meta_end_dot_

 in the lead up to super tuesday afscme and emily s list appear to have split responsibilities with afscme working ca and emily s list handling ct and nj _meta_end_dot_

 as seen in the polling results clinton performed much better than she polled on the way to wins in ca and nj although obama did narrowly prevail in ct _meta_end_dot_

 the spending in the three states was just under _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 in the states other than ma and ar where afscme and emily s list didn t work obama mostly won by huge margins _meta_end_dot_

 since super tuesday where spending wasn t as widely dispersed the ability of afscme the aft and emily s list to win big margins of women voters for clinton appears to have diminished _meta_end_dot_

 for the potomac primaries aft and afscme spent _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ about _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ in the media markets of md va and the dc media market shared by the district and both states and about _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ in mail and phones in md _meta_end_dot_

 nevertheless obama posted big wins in both states although his win was more modest in md where afscme dropped about six pieces of mail _meta_end_dot_

 for wisconsin the aft spent _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ on radio but none of the three organizations ran any mail or phones _meta_end_dot_

 it is probably not a coincidence that wi was the first contest since iowa where obama won the majority of white voters and split the women s vote _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 before obama generated momentum afscme the aft and emily s list appear to have been able to provide significant support to hillary clinton _meta_end_dot_

 they very well may have been the decisive factor in clinton s surprising and campaign saving win in new hampshire _meta_end_dot_

 they probably played an important part in her solid wins in nj and ca and may have kept ct close _meta_end_dot_

 but as the campaign has progressed the micro targeting of women that these three groups appear to have done so effectively has not been enough to hold back the growing strength of obama in all demographics _meta_end_dot_

 in the last few weeks afscme the aft and emily s list have spent heavily in ohio _meta_end_dot_

 however they now have competition in the ie game _meta_end_dot_

 obama is now supported by the seiu and that may dramatically offset any advantage clinton had been enjoying from the support of her three supporting organizations _meta_end_dot_

 we will look at what s going on in oh and tx later monday _meta_end_dot_
