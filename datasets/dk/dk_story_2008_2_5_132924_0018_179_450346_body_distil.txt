  this is a helluva way to pick a president _meta_end_dot_

 a handful of people in largely irrelevant states not that i don t love you iowa and new hampshire but sheesh are pandered to for months on end _meta_end_dot_

 the candidates move in steeping themselves in every nuance of these states local concerns _meta_end_dot_

 then comes the insanity of super tuesday this year even more insane than usual with _meta_number_ref_ states weighing in when these candidates who have only been tested by a bunch of frozen northerners and a national media with short attention spans and lack of ability to grasp nuance _meta_end_dot_

 so a narrative shaped by those handful of voters gets forced on the rest of us _meta_end_dot_

 unless you re california _meta_end_dot_

 the giganticness of california s delegate count alone means that they ll get plenty of face time with the candidates and their surrogates while the rest of us get scraps of attention _meta_end_dot_

 for the mountain west that s particularly true _meta_end_dot_

 understandable to an extent since the regular delegate as opposed to super delegate count in these states is relatively insignificant _meta_number_ref_ at stake for the democrats _meta_number_ref_ for the republicans _meta_end_dot_

 california is the western state that counts though the rest of the west doesn t really claim it it s an entity unto itself and the state out here that gets the lion s share of attention once those cold states are dispensed with _meta_end_dot_

 so that could be why the two candidates who actually paid attention to us out here will likely end up winning the west today _meta_end_dot_

 in addition to california today s contests include arizona primary colorado caucus utah primary and alaska caucus holding either primaries or caucuses for both parties _meta_end_dot_

 new mexico moved up its democratic primary in hopes of giving a boost to richardson so only the dems vote there today _meta_end_dot_

 only the idaho democrats caucuses today but montana is holding only republican caucuses _meta_end_dot_

 my prediction is that this majority of delegates in this swath of geography will go to obama and romney _meta_end_dot_

 granted this is primarily a gut feeling on my part because there has been next to no polling done in most of these states but demographics issues and where the candidates have been will make the difference _meta_end_dot_

 on the one hand you have clinton s inheritance of her husband s legacy and it isn t good for her in much of the west _meta_end_dot_

 the clinton hangover in the northern tier of rocky mountain states stems particularly from environmental wars of the _meta_number_ref_s where these states were ground zero _meta_end_dot_

 clinton s aggressive environmental initiatives met with intense hostility and were largely unfairly saddled with massive job losses in the extractive industries _meta_end_dot_

 those bad feelings still hold and many democrats in the region fear that clinton on the top of the ticket would be a huge motivating factor for the republican base making any downticket wins impossible _meta_end_dot_

 for the republicans mccain s relative moderate stance on immigration is motivating the base against him in a huge way _meta_end_dot_

 some of these states take a more nuanced view on the subject particularly in parts of idaho who s agriculture economy is hugely dependent on immigrant labor but the issue hurts him _meta_end_dot_

 what should have been his built in advantage of being the only western candidate left in the race is blunted in parts of arizona all of idaho and all of utah by romney s advantage as a mormon _meta_end_dot_

 with that very general thumbnail sketch here s what i expect to see in the individual states _meta_end_dot_

 alaska alaska does it s own thing to such an extent that it s pretty hard to know what they re thinking up there _meta_end_dot_

 but obama has a campaign office in anchorage and the thought that they might actually have a say in this contest has alaskans motivated _meta_end_dot_

 obama also has former gov _meta_end_dot_

 tony knowles working the phones for him _meta_end_dot_

 this is probably a case where a candidate paying attention to a state is going to make the difference _meta_end_dot_

 expect home stater mike gravel to get some sentimental support but not much _meta_end_dot_

 alaska republicans tend to be quixotic _meta_end_dot_

 this could actually be the state where ron paul wins though a likelier bet is romney who s also made an effort there _meta_end_dot_

 arizona on the dem side the latest polling shows a statistical dead heat between clinton and obama _meta_end_dot_

 both candidates have stumped in the state in the last couple of weeks _meta_end_dot_

 clinton should do well with latino voters and the substantial number of older women lots of retirees in arizona _meta_end_dot_

 but the change message is as salient in arizona as anywhere with the economy and health care being major concerns _meta_end_dot_

 arizona has been hit pretty hard by the mortgage crisis and obama has governor napolitano s endorsement _meta_end_dot_

 i predict obama by a narrow margin _meta_end_dot_

 on the republican side immigration is the overwhelming issue and one that will probably keep mccain from running away with his home state _meta_end_dot_

 in fact there s a substantial number of republicans actively working against him _meta_end_dot_

 the _meta_number_ref_ percent mormon population here will also give a boost to romney _meta_end_dot_

 colorado i m in colorado today in preparation for observing tonight s caucuses in larimer county a swing area where dem angie paccione came oh so close to knocking off the odious marilyn musgrave _meta_end_dot_

 the party is bracing for record turnout tonight just like everyone else _meta_end_dot_

 both obama and clinton have been to the state but with only cursory visits _meta_end_dot_

 kind of ironic considering the national convention is going to be here _meta_end_dot_

 clinton scored the endorsement of the denver post and a lot of the democratic establishment here _meta_end_dot_

 but the obama has a strong grassroots movement has an organizing edge and has the red purple state appeal _meta_end_dot_

 colorado is probably going to be close but i think it s going to go obama _meta_end_dot_

 the other is going to be interesting _meta_end_dot_

 the focus on the family south will most certaily go to huckabee though mccain will have a bit of an edge with the old military establishment folks there _meta_end_dot_

 that will be mccain s primary area of strength in the state i think and the fact that romney has been organized here even though his main recent event was at a ford dealership gives him the edge _meta_end_dot_

 idaho _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ people showed up to see obama speak in boise on saturday _meta_end_dot_

 lots of people were surprised by that but given the _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ that turned out for an al gore powerpoint show last january they probably shouldn t have been _meta_end_dot_

 practically every democratic office holder in the state granted there aren t a whole lot of them has endorsed obama _meta_end_dot_

 he walks away with it _meta_end_dot_

 idaho is _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ percent mormon _meta_end_dot_

 romney wins primary in may _meta_end_dot_

 new mexico clinton has the edge in new mexico with strong support in the state s latino community _meta_end_dot_

 she s also got strong establishment connections here and a lot of rank and file party workers _meta_end_dot_

 this could give her the same advantage in working the caucuses that it gave her in nevada _meta_end_dot_

 on the other hand the only recent poll in the state gives obama as much as _meta_number_ref_ point advantage _meta_end_dot_

 the new mexico state university poll has a _meta_number_ref_ point moe so take it with a grain of salt _meta_end_dot_

 utah obama was set to go to utah last weekend but cancelled out of respect for the funeral for gordon hinckley the former president of the mormon church _meta_end_dot_

 in his stead michelle obama stumped in slc yesterday _meta_end_dot_

 the last minute campaign stop didn t draw the thousands that obama has been getting in the region but the fact that the campaign had a presence there and that they have a field office in the state gives the edge to him again _meta_end_dot_

 on the republican side need you ask _meta_end_question_

 a strong romney showing in the mountain west and remember the republicans are winner take all could keep his campaign alive for a little while longer _meta_end_dot_

 and depending on obama s margin of victory in some of these states the delegate advantage hill receive will keep him in the delegate race for super tuesday _meta_end_dot_

 they might be little states but in a race this close every little bit counts _meta_end_dot_
