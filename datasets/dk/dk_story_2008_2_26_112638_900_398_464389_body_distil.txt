  in ohio note that the endorsement was done in ohio _meta_end_dot_

 dodd could be a big asset to obama in texas _meta_end_dot_

 in the _meta_number_ref_ s he served in the peace corps in the dominican republic and is fluent in spanish _meta_end_dot_

 when he campaigns for candidates outside connecticut he always offers to campaign with hispanic voters and is well received because unlike dubya and other pols who speak a few words of poorly accented spanish he s truly fluent _meta_end_dot_

 the decision to do the endorsement in ohio may simply have been a matter of schedule _meta_end_dot_

 with the senate in session this week ohio may just have been more convenient than flying all the way down to texas _meta_end_dot_

 but could it also be an indication that the obama campaign feels confident about its ability to win in texas and is now throwing all extra surrogates and resources at ohio in an attempt to win both states end hillary clinton s candidacy and effectively lock down the democratic nomination _meta_end_question_
