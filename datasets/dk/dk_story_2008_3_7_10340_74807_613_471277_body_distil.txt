  a new jobs report from the labor department and the picture it paints is bleaker than expected _meta_end_dot_

 this is the first time we ve had two straight months of decline since the first iraq powered downturn in the economy in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 jobs were not only lost in manufacturing and construction a sector that singlehandedly has lost more than _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ jobs since housing started to slump but across the board including sectors where gains had been expected _meta_end_dot_

 oddly enough the unemployment rate actually fell this month _meta_end_dot_

 why _meta_end_question_

 because the job situation has now become so tight that hundreds of thousands of people have given up even looking for a job _meta_end_dot_

 the economy is now caught between a rock and an even harder rock _meta_end_dot_

 on the one side the housing market continues to crumble _meta_end_dot_

 that s putting tremendous pressure on the federal reserve to lower interest rates and make more cash available _meta_end_dot_

 and yet even talk of lowering interest rates generates another problem _meta_end_dot_

 rising oil prices are directly visible at the pump and more and more visible elsewhere _meta_end_dot_

 for years pro globalization economists have been preaching the idea that shipping manufacturing to the country most willing to endure poverty and pollution provided a buffer against inflation _meta_end_dot_

 no more _meta_end_dot_

 even in normal times such a confluence of economic ills would be a tough job for the nation to weather _meta_end_dot_

 this time it s going to be even harder because every dime we might use to provide flexibility in dealing with this issue is being spent in iraq _meta_end_dot_
