 wolf making gestures at interrupting but not assertively wolf to clinton would you raise cap _meta_end_question_

 clinton does not start by answering _meta_end_dot_

 fiscal responsibility _meta_end_dot_

 bush trashed it and now we have challenges we didn t at the beginning of his presidency _meta_end_dot_

 lifting cap is tax increase and therefore bad _meta_end_dot_

 yeah terrible that warren buffett should pay the same percentage that most people do obama only _meta_percent_ref_ make above cap that s not the middle class that s the wealthy _meta_end_dot_

 it s not a trillion dollar tax increase on the middle class _meta_end_dot_

 biden no ideologues _meta_end_dot_

 have enough professors on bench _meta_end_dot_

 when hillary s husband asked for advice we wanted someone who had lived life would appoint a woman _meta_end_dot_

 would not appoint anyone who didn t understand that constitution provides right to privacy which means support of roe _meta_end_dot_

 richardson diversity as criterion but do you believe roe is settled law do you support privacy civil rights something else _meta_end_question_

 if you want to call it a litmus test fine _meta_end_dot_

 kucinich pause there would be a litmus test on abortion _meta_end_dot_

 question of a woman s right to choose and privacy _meta_end_dot_

 but a president has to be a healer and i ll stand for pre natal post natal care we can make abortions less necessary if we have a healer in the white house _meta_end_dot_

 clinton they d have to share my view about privacy and that goes hand in hand _meta_end_dot_

 free speech worship as you choose be left alone _meta_end_dot_

 senator biden deserves plaudits because he understands how gov t is supposed to work unlike bush _meta_end_dot_

 obama would not support someone who doesn t believe in right to privacy _meta_end_dot_

 as wolf mentioned taught law and it s not just how they rule it s their conception of the court and it needs to protect the vulnerable _meta_end_dot_

 we need people who understands what it means to be on the outside and have system not work for them _meta_end_dot_

 edwards i would insist that they recognize right to privacy and roe as settled law _meta_end_dot_
