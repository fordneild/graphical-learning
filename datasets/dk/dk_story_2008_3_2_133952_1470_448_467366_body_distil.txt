  though many people enjoy the glitz glitter and gowns of the oscars i find myself more entertained by the companion golden raspberry awards affectionately known as the razzies yes the red carpet may be a bit more sparsely populated but where else are you going to see such nail biting results as lindsay lohan tying for worst actress with lindsay lohan _meta_end_question_

 al gore may have that nobel peace prize but does this carry the glamor of the ig nobel prize awarded for investigating the medical effects of sword swallowing _meta_end_question_

 i think not _meta_end_dot_

 and what modern political award can come close to the glory of the flying fickle finger of fate _meta_end_question_

 the recently departed conservative icon william f _meta_end_dot_

 buckley won the coveted rigid digit for his impressively brief distillation of all conservative philosophy never clarify tomorrow what you can obscure today match that jimmy carter _meta_end_dot_

 no one is quicker than journalists who report on award shows and know that a good set of awards can result in keen parties swag bags and considerable exposed cleavage to develop awards of their own _meta_end_dot_

 pulitzers peabodys polks quick now which one of these did bill o reilly actually win the stream of journalistic backslaps mounted on a plaque seems endless _meta_end_dot_

 and that s not even counting how many times they get together with the folks they re supposed to be objectively reporting about to split a plate of lobster and a barrel of champagne _meta_end_dot_

 the tuxedo rental nearest the washington post probably gets more business than all of iowa in prom season _meta_end_dot_

 so it only seems appropriate that an industry which dispenses so many lauds and honors deserves yet another award the opprobrium awards for outstanding performance in the achievement of journalist shame _meta_end_dot_

 please note that these awards exclude the likes of radio pundits and everyone with a toe in fox news _meta_end_dot_

 there are several reasons for this _meta_end_dot_

 one is a sense of fairness to the rest of the field running a bad journalism contest in which bill o reilly was allowed to participate would be like listening to an old _meta_number_ref_ that had gotten stuck repeating the same name over and over _meta_end_dot_

 another is that typical journalistic categories would seem a bit tame our nominees for the most creepy discussion of how i would kill an american political figure are glenn beck michael savage mostly it s because there s little point in handing out awards to conservative pundits for being idiots _meta_end_dot_

 that s like giving the sun a certificate for being yellow _meta_end_dot_

 just as first academy awards had only a few categories the initial list of opprobriums is brief with each category named for it s worthy winner _meta_end_dot_

 the name of the winners has been sealed in an envelope held under funk wagnall s left armpit since noon on tuesday okay actually it was just funk _meta_end_dot_

 walk carefully down the yellow carpet take a seat and please hold your applause _meta_end_dot_

 the first category is worst editorial achievement _meta_end_dot_

 this is truly a small d democratic category _meta_end_dot_

 despite the name people from all walks of life are invited to play at writing these columns and most of them couldn t actually edit a third grade term paper given a fist full of red pencils _meta_end_dot_

 just ask the editorial board of the wall street journal _meta_end_dot_

 bad editorials are so common that its difficult to sort through the mass of stinkers and find one skunk that outsmells the rest _meta_end_dot_

 fortunately for the judges there was one name this year that produced unmatched odorosity _meta_end_dot_

 this editorial cannily predicted not just the decline of visitation at daily kos at the start of the same month in which the site smashed all previous records but engaged in grave dancing over the idea that senator obama s victories were the last nail in the coffin for daily kos _meta_end_dot_

 this insightful political sage argued that the young voters supporting obama were foreshadowed in the election of joe lieberman despite lieberman actually losing that same cadre of voters and that lieberman and obama were two sides of the same coin _meta_end_dot_

 while bad editorials are common as dust and awful editorials are a plague on the ground this kind of accomplishment has to be recognized _meta_end_dot_

 ladies and gentlemen for outstanding some might say superhuman efforts in the realms of self aggrandizement self delusion and spin the award for worst editorial achievement goes to political commentator dan gerstein _meta_end_dot_

 to immortalize this accomplishment future recipients of this award will receive a golden gerstein take a bow dan _meta_end_dot_

 it seems appropriate in a set of journalism awards that one should go to an actual journalist _meta_end_dot_

 so if you find one call me rim shot _meta_end_dot_

 the next category recognizes the reporter who has done more to degrade the public discourse than any other the reporter that has practiced simply sleazy reporting _meta_end_dot_

 fortunately for the judges the choice in this category wasn t exactly difficult _meta_end_dot_

 after all there is one reporter who has proven herself in one political season after another _meta_end_dot_

 one who is more willing to spread wild rumors and repeat the ugliest of talking points _meta_end_dot_

 one ready and able to quote well known political enemies as inside sources of their opponents _meta_end_dot_

 one reporter whose insight starts in the sewers and never rises above the gutters _meta_end_dot_

 you knew her for innuendo attacks on howard dean and john kerry and how you know her for her fact free assaults on senator obama as an america hating empty suit _meta_end_dot_

 the winner the simply sleazy reporting award goes to nedra pickler _meta_end_dot_

 congrats ms _meta_end_dot_

 pickler _meta_end_dot_

 from now on reporters who as you did get their political quotes from the founder of c u n t _meta_end_dot_

 will know they are the proud owners of a sour pickler award _meta_end_dot_

 and now it s time for the lifetime achievement award _meta_end_dot_

 yes yes the list of achievements was short and giving a lifetime award the first time around seems odd but since gerstein assures me no one is reading why bother with more _meta_end_question_

 for this lifetime achievement award the category is outstanding career accomplishment in the art of stenography _meta_end_dot_

 there s a term for repeating what the administration tells you without question _meta_end_dot_

 it s called white house correspondent however the occupants of the new press room can t hold a candle to the achievements of our winner _meta_end_dot_

 it s one thing to repeat someone s lies while standing on the east lawn _meta_end_dot_

 it s quite another to repeatedly deny the evidence of your own eyes and keep fear alive _meta_end_exclamation_

 no matter what _meta_end_dot_

 the highly deserved award for lifetime achievement in stenography goes to judith miller _meta_end_dot_

 keep typing them up judy _meta_end_dot_

 i m sure those wmds are in the next warehouse _meta_end_dot_

 from now on this award will be simply the miller award and will be shaped like a metal tube _meta_end_dot_

 that s all folks _meta_end_exclamation_

 photo opportunities are around back _meta_end_dot_

 see you at the party _meta_end_dot_
