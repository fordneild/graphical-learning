  last week mike huckabee broke with longstanding precedent as he unveiled a presidential campaign ad infused with deeply religious tones just look at the screen shot _meta_end_dot_

 you can tell from the very first shot that they intended to have a giant white floating cross moving behind mike huckabee _meta_end_dot_

 there is no mistaking it _meta_end_dot_

 there is zero chance that it was placed there by accident _meta_end_dot_

 but as mike huckabee was on the road with his huckster revival rhetoric that is exactly what huckabee claimed on cbs face the nation well i have watched that ad repeatedly _meta_end_dot_

 ad libbed or not there is absolutely positively no way on earth that the white book shelf just happened to magically have just the right amount of shadow effect and special lighting to make it appear as a big glowing white moving cross timed perfectly to end behind him as the camera rotated and the spot came to an end _meta_end_dot_

 it was clearly done as an intended effect _meta_end_dot_

 and i can t help but think that makes mike huckabee a bold faced liar _meta_end_dot_

 let s see some other footage from that set _meta_end_dot_

 let s see how that bookshelf looks in any other shots video or camera _meta_end_dot_

 let s talk to your camera and lighting crew _meta_end_dot_

 i seriously want to know what production company created the spot _meta_end_dot_

 was it created by one of his televangelist buddies _meta_end_question_

 either way it was no accident and his flat out lying about it is embarassing _meta_end_dot_

 and on the same day that the dallas morning news endorses him _meta_end_dot_

 what a joke _meta_end_exclamation_

 shame on them _meta_end_dot_

 what does the dallas morning news think about his deep connections to the profit prophets and televangelists who are under under investigation by congress _meta_end_question_

 gracious authentic and humble _meta_end_dot_

 that s just what i think when i hear copeland say things like this on his website does copeland really believe he has taken over politics and politicians _meta_end_question_

 does that mean that he controls mike huckabee _meta_end_question_

 and humble _meta_end_question_

 yes that is exactly what i think of kenneth and gloria copeland when i read this and this _meta_end_dot_

 so the _meta_dollor_ref_ million was a gift _meta_end_dot_

 that their son went out and solicited from their flock _meta_end_dot_

 yes i can see how they would be considered humble by mike huckabee _meta_end_dot_

 it s not like they went out and asked for _meta_dollor_ref_ million dollars _meta_end_dot_

 their son did _meta_end_dot_

 totally different _meta_end_dot_

 but these are exactly the type of people that mike huckabee surrounds himself with phonies _meta_end_dot_

 each one working their own scam _meta_end_dot_

 will the republican voters fall for mike huckabee s revival tour _meta_end_question_

 sending their checks to mike huckabee so america can be healed we shall see _meta_end_dot_

 if they don t mike huckabee may have a future as america s next great money driven televangelist _meta_end_dot_

 after all his recent stint last month of six straight days on copeland s religious fundraising television program appears to have been well received because it certainly awoke the televangelist voters who tuned in _meta_end_dot_

 will the rest of the so called values voters really fall for huckabee s televangelist schtick _meta_end_question_

 as far as the overtly religious messages in huckabee s christmas ad who are voters going to believe _meta_end_question_

 mike huckabee or their lying eyes _meta_end_question_

 update the ad was created by a san fransico based firm called dresner wickers associates _meta_end_dot_

 from their own website here is what they have to say about the television spots they create for political candidates i
