  it s really sad to see one union going after another but that s what s happening following the culinary workers union endorsement of barack obama in next saturday s nevada caucus the system of at large precincts had been designed to allow as many casino workers as possible to attend caucuses on what is for them a workday _meta_end_dot_

 anyone who can show that they work within _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ miles of the strip will be allowed to participate in these special caucus sites _meta_end_dot_

 the nevada state education association a plaintiff in the suit argues that special accommodations have been made for casino workers but not for others such as janitors who have to open schools to serve as regular caucus sites and are therefore unable to caucus in their home precincts _meta_end_dot_

 but the arrangement should not come as any surprise so why file a suit now _meta_end_question_

 the only thing that s changed is the culinary workers endorsement of obama and the tightness of the race _meta_end_dot_

 though the teachers union has not endorsed clinton some of its top officials have and this move is widely seen as an attempt to minimize the effect of the culinary endorsement for obama _meta_end_dot_

 after iowa hillary clinton expressed her disapproval of a system that disenfranchises many workers _meta_end_dot_

 nevada has gone out of its way to mitigate that effect of the caucus system only to have apparently politically motivated objections arise late apparently on her behalf _meta_end_dot_

 over at talkleft jeralyn suggests ways the teachers union s concerns might be dealt with _meta_end_dot_

 but whatever the legitimacy of their concerns the timing is shameful _meta_end_dot_
