  there was an important development on tuesday at guant namo _meta_end_dot_

 a ruling by the judge in salim hamdan s military commission appears to require entirely new hearings for any prisoners who claim to be pows _meta_end_dot_

 hamdan had appealed for a pow status hearing under article _meta_number_ref_ of the third geneva convention _meta_end_dot_

 the ruling by navy captain keith allred went strongly in his favor _meta_end_dot_

 allred rejects the congressional view that combatant status review tribunals had been adequate to determine pow status _meta_end_dot_

 that view was asserted forcefully by sen _meta_end_dot_

 lindsay graham in _meta_number_ref_ during hearings for the military commissions act _meta_end_dot_

 allred however concludes that csrts concerned themselves with whether the prisoners were enemy combatants and therefore weren t competent to determine whether the men were prisoners of war _meta_end_dot_

 the military commissions are defective by design and should not be permitted to stand in for civil trials but at least one prisoner has been assigned a judge who is willing to face up to the plain flaws in the legal system that the bush administration slapped together _meta_end_dot_

 in other words as lyle denniston points out the ruling implies that none of the prisoners at gitmo are necessarily subject to the military commissions act until a competent tribunal finds that they are _meta_end_dot_

 of course the csrt process was an irremediable sham as the declaration by lt _meta_end_dot_

 col _meta_end_dot_

 stephen abraham documented for the case of al odah _meta_end_dot_

 the csrts existed to give the appearance of due process without granting prisoners any actual ability to gain their freedom prove their innocence or even confront their accusers _meta_end_dot_

 the new system of military commissions was built upon a foundation of sand the ridiculous claims that csrts i constituted an adequate substitute for habeas review and ii cut off any appeal to rights under the geneva conventions _meta_end_dot_

 now that foundation is crumbling badly _meta_end_dot_

 if allred s ruling is upheld it could greatly complicate the question of the guantanamo prisoners rights while at the same time forcing the us to grant geneva protections to many or perhaps all prisoners for the time being _meta_end_dot_

 t he csrts loom large in the background of the consolidated boumediene al odah cases heard by the supreme court on dec _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 the main issue before scotus was whether the mca may strip gitmo prisoners of access to civil courts _meta_end_dot_

 the government argued that the mca s jurisdiction stripping provision is reasonable because the csrts had already substituted for habeas review _meta_end_dot_

 but as the allred ruling highlights the csrts were ad hoc tribunals and extremely narrowly focused _meta_end_dot_

 even if the csrt were not the kangaroo court that stephen abraham documents they still shouldn t be treated as substitutes for anything certainly nothing as fundamental as habeas review _meta_end_dot_

 the quality of the oral arguments in boumediene two weeks ago was abysmal on the central issue of due process _meta_end_dot_

 it was especially disappointing to find justice ginsburg joining roberts in trying to identify an excuse to send the cases back for district court review in determining whether csrts are an adequate substitute for habeas _meta_end_dot_

 roberts appears to reject the plaintiffs argument that they ve been waiting too damned long already for habeas review _meta_end_dot_

 he wonders why the court should care that for six long years they ve been given the run around _meta_end_dot_

 justice kennedy later chimed in as if the six year wait were merely a footnote to the larger questions _meta_end_dot_

 such arrogance _meta_end_dot_

 or could roberts kennedy and ginsburg possibly be that ignorant of the facts of existence at gitmo _meta_end_question_

 the central point is one that i m astonished anybody could fail to see prolonged confinement at guant namo is torture _meta_end_dot_

 the military carefully created conditions of confinement in order to crush the prisoners mental resilience _meta_end_dot_

 amnesty international has found that _meta_percent_ref_ of prisoners were held in solitary confinement _meta_end_dot_

 most of the prison buildings at gitmo are designed specifically to further that goal _meta_end_dot_

 what do these fools on the supreme court suppose happens to the human mind after prolonged solitary confinement _meta_end_question_

 it s absolutely sickening that six years into a series of delaying tactics engineered by the bush administration there s any need to discuss whether the habeas review needs to be expedited _meta_end_dot_

 here scotus take a good look _meta_end_dot_

 this is what occurs after years of such confinement binyam mohamed like all the other prisoners at guant namo continues to wait in vain for a habeas review _meta_end_dot_

 as far as several supreme court justices are concerned his five years of mental torture is just another footnote to more important issues _meta_end_dot_
