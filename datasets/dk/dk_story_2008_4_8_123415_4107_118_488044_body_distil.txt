  lieberman about a week ago ross douthat responded at the time it may have been a small group on the left that helped push the party in the right direction but it was the huge american majorities in _meta_number_ref_ that endorsed our efforts and helped us take control of the house and senate _meta_end_dot_

 we are now poised for similar gains in _meta_number_ref_ not because of lieberman s loser dead end politics but because the democratic party has convincingly moved beyond them _meta_end_dot_

 smart democrats are learning that the public loves unambiguous progressivism _meta_end_dot_

 the dumb ones like lieberman are holding on to discredited ideologies watching the world pass them by while using stupid surrogates like dan gerstein to try and spin away their growing irrelevance _meta_end_dot_

 so we got idiocies like this one from gerstein back in early february when the reality was this or stupidities like this one trying to equate joe lieberman s _meta_number_ref_ senate race to barack obama s race today when the reality was that _meta_number_ref_ lieberman would go on to endorse not obama but republican john mccain making a fool of gerstein s efforts to equate the two politicians and _meta_number_ref_ connecticut independents have long abandoned lieberman and his misleading campaign the one where he avoided his pro war record instead declaring in a television commercial i want to help end the war in iraq those voters are no longer fooled research _meta_number_ref_ for daily kos _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 regular voters _meta_end_dot_

 moe _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ results now it s clear that gerstein continues to feed lieberman lines like this particularly hilarious one unfortunately for them both the cold hard numbers don t lie _meta_end_dot_

 that small group on the left they re talking about is really a majority of their own constituents and it s also a number that continues to grow over time _meta_end_dot_
