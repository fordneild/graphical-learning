  the caucus in las vegas has been suspended what does this mean for the results of the caucuses in the other counties _meta_end_question_

 will those results stand or will they have to be redone so all the caucuses in nevada occurred on the same day _meta_end_question_

 and what does this do to the clinton campaign s arguments against having new contests in michigan and florida _meta_end_question_

 if a severely flawed contest in nevada can be redone presumably with the support of both campaigns why shouldn t the flawed votes in michigan and florida which were not recognized by the dnc be replaced with legitimate contests _meta_end_question_

 the dnc has given each state until june to submit new delegate selection plans so there s plenty of time to do it _meta_end_dot_

 seems that if nevada should have a do over there s not much of an argument against michigan and florida having a new vote one which is recognized from the start as legitimate and binding and recognized by the dnc and all campaigns _meta_end_dot_
