  chuck todd actually both campaigns have stopped what had been daily bragging about their cash intake _meta_end_dot_

 we ll have a better idea soon enough when they announce their march results but her february numbers didn t inspire confidence nor her inability to pay her bills _meta_end_dot_

 obama had over _meta_dollor_ref_ million on hand at the end of february after accounting for his debts about _meta_dollor_ref_k _meta_end_dot_

 so when will the campaigns announce their march numbers _meta_end_question_

 they have a couple of weeks to do so _meta_end_dot_

 if the clinton campaign had good numbers you d think she d release them sooner rather than later in order to squash these she s running out of money stories _meta_end_dot_

 that s exactly what she did last month when she announced her impressive february haul of _meta_dollor_ref_ million before the month was even out _meta_end_dot_

 obama waited until after his oho and texas losses and yes he lost the texas popular vote regardless of his delegate win and used his haul of _meta_dollor_ref_ million to blunt the impact of her victories _meta_end_dot_

 my guess is that the longer she waits to release her numbers the worse they are _meta_end_dot_

 what about obama _meta_end_question_

 if he had great numbers you d think he d announce quickly to reinforce the we ve won this thing already narrative _meta_end_dot_

 so either they are waiting because they re not confident they ve outraised clinton or they re waiting to one up her when she finally does announce _meta_end_dot_

 update to clarify obama s _meta_dollor_ref_ million at the end of february was all available for primary use _meta_end_dot_

 he has a bit more earmarked for the general election but it s not a significant amount _meta_end_dot_
