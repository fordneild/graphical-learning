  later this week i will go back and tally up all my predictions this cycle _meta_end_dot_

 get this some were good and some were bad _meta_end_dot_

 some were real bad _meta_end_dot_

 it s like flipping a coin but fun _meta_end_exclamation_

 so here goes again _meta_end_dot_

 i must admit that my texas prediction feels pretty good _meta_end_dot_

 i don t mean it as in i know it s true because no one really knows until the voters have spoken _meta_end_dot_

 i mean it as in i ve got a good sense of the dynamics in the state _meta_end_dot_

 i am basing that prediction on some sort of data _meta_end_dot_

 ohio on the other hand is an enigma to me _meta_end_dot_

 i don t get the state at the gut level _meta_end_dot_

 i ve read the reports pored over the polls and tried to get a sense of where things are headed _meta_end_dot_

 heck i m even trying to figure out what it means that obama decided to spend the last _meta_number_ref_ hours of the campaign in texas not ohio _meta_end_dot_

 does that mean that he s giving up on ohio because it s out of reach _meta_end_question_

 or does it mean his campaign thinks it s close enough to minimize the damage and they d rather shoot for the big win in texas _meta_end_question_

 beats me _meta_end_dot_

 so my ohio prediction truly feels more like a simple guess than an educated guess which is where i am with texas _meta_end_dot_

 one quick point i think clinton has gained some ground or at least stemmed the bleeding in the last few days _meta_end_dot_

 so that is playing a role in lowering my numbers for obama from what they would ve been a week ago _meta_end_dot_

 in any case enough caveats
