  many pundits and media commentators made a fuss in _meta_number_ref_ calling that election the youtube election _meta_end_dot_

 for years anyone with a video camera could capture pols in embarrassing moments but if the video was never shared with others or if the gatekeepers in television news didn t deem it newsworthy few would see it _meta_end_dot_

 youtube eliminated the monopoly of the gatekeepers and both campaigns and those who wanted to take down a candidate seized the opportunities to disseminate video _meta_end_dot_

 the archetypal example of the changes wrought by youtube is the defeat of virginia senator george allen due in part to his now infamous macaca moment _meta_end_dot_

 we re currently in a very peculiar youtube moment in the democratic nomination contest _meta_end_dot_

 over the last week hillary clinton has been trying to slough off criticism that she had a walter mitty moment in which she claimed that in _meta_number_ref_ she once landed in tuzla bosnia under sniper fire and had to run to her vehicle to escape the flying bullets _meta_end_dot_

 the truth you probably now know is that the dayton accords had been signed the previous year and that the tuzla airport was safe enough that the president had visited it earlier in the year _meta_end_dot_

 not only didn t she have to run for her life she in fact participated in a calm ceremony on the tarmac with many people including the president of bosnia an _meta_number_ref_ year old bosnian girl and her daughter chelsea _meta_end_dot_

 what makes this a youtube campaign moment isn t that someone caught hillary clinton in an unguarded or reckless moment and posted the video on youtube for all to see _meta_end_dot_

 no what makes this a youtube campaign moment is that the video from _meta_number_ref_ years ago has ended up on youtube to show that clinton is completely wrong in almost every one of her assertions about that visit to tuzla _meta_end_dot_

 as keith olberman explained just about every detail clinton gave was false she s told the false story multiple times she and her campaign refused for several days to admit she was wrong and even now her mea culpa is hedged not particularly forthcoming and is still less than candid in admitting that what she said was false let me tell you what i can remember here s the youtube moment what she now claims she was told or what she can or can t remember is less significant than what can easily be found on youtube namely a whole slew of contemporaneous television news reports that clearly contradict her earlier claims that she was subjected to sniper fire it s been available on youtube for days and has now been supplemented with several other reports showing the same events from slightly different camera angles _meta_end_dot_

 and it hardly takes the kind of maniacal focus on details that obsessives have lavished on the zapruder film to see that everything was calm that she strolled out of the plane toward the ceremony and that there was no imminent threat to her life or the lives of anyone else on that tarmac _meta_end_dot_

 unlike the macaca moment this wasn t a new piece of video _meta_end_dot_

 it wasn t a revelation something previously unknown and exposed to the world _meta_end_dot_

 this time the problem for the candidate isn t something she just said that ended up on youtube it s that what she said is easily refuted by watching video available for everyone to see on youtube _meta_end_dot_

 in the past a campaign might have hoped that something like this would go away that the traditional media especially television news would not run the old video _meta_end_dot_

 but the old video got out via youtube and people have been looking at it for days except apparently hillary clinton who is still talking about what she was told which doesn t hold up to what we thanks to youtube can see with our own eyes _meta_end_dot_
