  as in previous democratic debates i have in mind some questions that probably nobody will ask _meta_end_dot_

 here are three of them _meta_end_dot_

 some of the candidates have already answered one or more of these questions will you seek to repeal the patriot act or any of its provisions _meta_end_question_

 which provisions _meta_end_question_

 will you shut down any of the more than _meta_number_ref_ military bases the united states has operating in _meta_number_ref_ countries around the world _meta_end_question_

 will you reopen the investigation of _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ to look at issues that the previous investigations have glossed or slopped over _meta_end_question_

 what questions would you ask _meta_end_question_
