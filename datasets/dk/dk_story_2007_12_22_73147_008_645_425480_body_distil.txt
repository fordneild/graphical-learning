 released a report _meta_number_ref_ver _meta_number_ref_ prominent scientists disputed man made global warming claims in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 as a taxpayer to start with i am outraged that my taxes are used to support such truthiness and distortions _meta_end_dot_

 as a human being i am outraged that such deniers roadblock republicans are able to stand in the way toward moving the nation and the globe toward a more sensible energy future _meta_end_dot_

 and as an analyst i am outraged that such mediocrity is allowed to be pedaled as a report with the imprimateur of the us government and a us senate committee behind it _meta_end_dot_

 a full throated examination of the mediocrity of this collection of misleading climate denier and climate skeptic and delayer material is beyond the ability of one single post _meta_end_dot_

 but after the fold this posting provides just a taste of the reviews and examinations of just the first three of the peer reviewed studies cited by james inhofe and his staff support for global warming denial _meta_end_dot_

 take a look and join with me in questioning what peer review means when coming from james inhofe s mouth _meta_end_dot_

 inhofe calls on us to listen to the un ipcc chairman rajendra pachauri inhofe s science does not stand up to scientific scrutiny _meta_end_dot_

 see what science has to say about these peer reviewed studies _meta_end_dot_

 a quick note to start this conversation _meta_end_dot_

 if you care about the planet real climate is your friend _meta_end_dot_

 very high quality science seriously footnoted but written in a way that is accessible to all even if you might skip over some calculations and some references might make you wish you hadn t been hungover that day in physics _meta_end_dot_

 just remember realclimate is your friend _meta_end_dot_

 and to review the quality of the material here one can simply rely on your friends _meta_end_dot_

 so going to frind realclimate let us take the first three on the list _meta_end_dot_

 and if you aren t tired of this yet the fourth study is analyzed and shredded here _meta_end_dot_

 and so on _meta_end_dot_

 it is a tiresome task but simply using search at real climate provides the ability to show just how peerless the peer review process must have been for inhofe s cited studies _meta_end_dot_

 more below the fold _meta_end_dot_
