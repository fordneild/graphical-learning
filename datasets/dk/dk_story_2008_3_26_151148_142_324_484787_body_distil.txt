  the more i see of unanue the more i think he might be a worthy successor to our dearly dropped out steve kirby _meta_end_dot_

 makes sense given his nightclub _meta_end_dot_

 just don t mind him if he reeks of alcohol _meta_end_dot_

 being a senator is hard work so he ll celebrate that _meta_end_dot_
