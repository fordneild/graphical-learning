 we re not even to _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ yet so there s a long way to go _meta_end_dot_

 if you re focused on the presidential race let me put it this way blue majority candidates are running in swing states like virginia florida washington and minnesota _meta_end_dot_

 if they have early money to be running a strong ground game that will help get out the vote _meta_end_dot_

 and come january _meta_number_ref_ a democratic president will need strong majorities in congress to accomplish the things we all so want to see _meta_end_dot_

 so even if your heart is fully committed to a presidential candidate give to a blue majority candidate for his or her sake _meta_end_dot_
