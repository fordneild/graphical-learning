  wow of all the polls i ve commissioned thus far this one has the most surprising results _meta_end_dot_

 moore doesn t get much better numbers than musgrove and pickering who is supposedly the most popular politician in mississippi didn t do as well as wicker who is likely to be appointed to the seat _meta_end_dot_

 research _meta_number_ref_ for daily kos _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 likely voters _meta_end_dot_

 moe _meta_percent_ref_ no trend lines if _meta_number_ref_ election for u s _meta_end_dot_

 senate were held today for whom would you vote for if the choices were between _ ____ the democrat and _ ____ the republican _meta_end_question_

 note that moore said thursday that he wouldn t be running for the seat _meta_end_dot_

 and pickering has been out of contention as well _meta_end_dot_

 given these numbers there s little impetus for the k street bound republican to get pulled into the race _meta_end_dot_

 it looks like they ve already got their strongest candidate already under consideration _meta_end_dot_

 full results below the fold _meta_end_dot_

 update i just got the racial breakout of the poll and it looks like african americans were heavily undersampled white _meta_number_ref_ black _meta_number_ref_ other _meta_number_ref_ according to cnn s exit poll in _meta_number_ref_ african americans made up _meta_percent_ref_ of the electorate _meta_end_dot_

 now the poll got the r d i ratio right but i d suspect that a white democrats would be more likely to vote for a republican than an african american _meta_end_dot_

 from the exit polls _meta_percent_ref_ of democrats voted for bush but only _meta_number_ref_ percent of african americans did _meta_end_dot_

 so this poll is likely giving the republican candidates a slight boost _meta_end_dot_
