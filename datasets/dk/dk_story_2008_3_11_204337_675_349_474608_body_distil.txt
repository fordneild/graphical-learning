  interesting that geraldine ferraro first made her racist comments on wingnut john gibson s show february _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 so this wasn t an off the cuff statement _meta_end_dot_

 you know she s been pulling this card when talking to donors _meta_end_dot_

 ferraro also rants against rosa delauro that she only endorsed obama because he was black like her constituents _meta_end_dot_

 what s scary is that gibson was actually a voice of reason to the crazy ferraro who in a moment of self awareness says i m like a lunatic about this stuff yes she is _meta_end_dot_

 then she goes on fox news to cry that she s being discriminated against because she s white _meta_end_dot_
