  well at least grover was honest about his motivation for strangling labor unions with red tape _meta_end_dot_

 but as a terrific new report from the center for american progress shows that s not the case with most of the partisan republican hacks who have been directed by their corporate masters to drown unions in paperwork _meta_end_dot_

 the cap report details what any union officer knows over the past five or six years the bush department of labor s office of labor management standards has systematically and dramatically increased the financial reporting burden faced by labor unions _meta_end_dot_

 now no real unionist is opposed to transparency and sensible reporting but the reporting requirements imposed by the bushies have little to do with transparency and everything to do with forcing unions to waste time and money jumping through unnecessary hoops _meta_end_dot_

 and these attempts to hogtie unions have come at the same time that the bush administration has been loosening corporate regulations and allowing big business to run rampant _meta_end_dot_

 as cap notes read the whole thing _meta_end_dot_
