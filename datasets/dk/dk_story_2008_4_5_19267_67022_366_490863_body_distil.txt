  bush broke the army iraq remains a lethal place for us soldiers and marines we lost _meta_number_ref_ americans in march _meta_end_dot_

 last week muqtada al sadr made it clear that any decrease if fighting in iraq that s not due to the already completed population transfers in mixed sectarian parts of the country like baghdad remains tenuous and largely out the control of u s _meta_end_dot_

 forces _meta_end_dot_

 us forces were mostly bystanders during the fighting between shiite factions but if our soldiers and marines are asked to engage iraqi forces casualties could quickly go back to the levels we saw in _meta_number_ref_ and early _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 iraq could get ugly again and very quickly _meta_end_dot_

 the administration could decide to help the iraqi government impose order in basra _meta_end_dot_

 the sunni clans we re buying off to not fight against us or other iraqis could turn on the iraqi government or against the shiite militias putting our soldiers back in the middle of the civil war _meta_end_dot_

 al sadr could unilaterally end his on again off again cease fire _meta_end_dot_

 and the true nightmare scenario is iraqi arabs squaring off against the iraqi kurds over the kurds de facto quasi independent state let in the north of the country _meta_end_dot_

 any of these scenarios is plausible _meta_end_dot_

 the administration and their lackeys in the gop and the media continue to tout the surge as a success as david petreus and ryan crocker are certain to do before congress this week _meta_end_dot_

 but there s been almost zero political progress in iraq _meta_end_dot_

 there s still no effective central control as we saw with the debacle in basra _meta_end_dot_

 and the important issues like sharing oil revenue and figuring out the degree of central control and regional autonomy are no closer to being settle now than they were two years ago _meta_end_dot_

 the only big differences between two years ago and today is that a lot more soldiers are on their third deployment to iraq the taliban are even more powerful in afghanistan more sergeants and captains have left the military and more of the men and women we re putting in to that war zone are suffering from the strain and shouldn t be standing in iraq with a gun suffering from anxiety fatigue and ptsd hoping they don t get blown up _meta_end_dot_
