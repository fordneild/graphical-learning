  this story from science also covered by effect measure is an important turning point for the bush administration s approach to science _meta_end_dot_

 zerhouni who is way to close to big pharma and privatized sources has directed a great deal of this _meta_end_dot_

 the bottom line is that public health cannot be privatized and yet continue to function as an honest broker _meta_end_dot_

 the deep suspicion is that schwartz functioned with zerhouni s blessing _meta_end_dot_

 from effect measure there have been two major problems with the bush approach to science _meta_end_dot_

 one has been the placement of political minders in various positions to influence the science reporting _meta_end_dot_

 the other has been a philosophical acceptance that private industry should have a role in regulating the regulators _meta_end_dot_

 it s hard to say which has been the biggest disaster _meta_end_dot_

 the end result is an erosion of both morale and excellence in the science community _meta_end_dot_

 both results are unacceptable and require a ballot box response to right the ship and in the meantime suggest an excellent set of questions to address to the candidates _meta_end_dot_

 science research needs to be encouraged and nurtured not held captive to political and commercial interests _meta_end_dot_

 november _meta_number_ref_ can t come a moment too soon _meta_end_dot_
