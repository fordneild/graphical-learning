  this is what happens when people have one party rule for too long _meta_end_dot_

 since _meta_number_ref_ idaho hasn t had a prominent statewide elected official no governors lieutenant governors attorney generals secretaries of state superintendants of public instruction nada _meta_end_dot_

 among the _meta_number_ref_ current house members there are _meta_number_ref_ democrats after a gain of six dems in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 in a senate of _meta_number_ref_ there are seven democrats _meta_end_dot_

 what s more a study last year found that idaho s legislature is the oldest in the nation _meta_end_dot_

 no not the one that has been around the longest the one that has the most elderly membership _meta_end_dot_

 there are no term limits in idaho s legislature and when you get a seat it pretty much ends up being for life unless you have grander ambitions _meta_end_dot_

 it s a heavily rural and male dominated group and one that is increasingly out of touch _meta_end_dot_

 idaho has had the nation s fourth fastest growth rate for the past three years and that growth is in urban areas _meta_end_dot_

 idaho is quickly outgrowing its leadership and is clamoring for change _meta_end_dot_

 how do i know _meta_end_question_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ idahoans turned out to caucus in last night s dems only event _meta_end_dot_

 in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ caucused _meta_end_dot_

 this is possibly the first time in idaho history that there was a democratic caucus in every one of idaho s _meta_number_ref_ counties _meta_end_dot_

 idaho history maven jim weatherby doesn t remember it ever happening before so that s enough for me _meta_end_dot_

 one caucus goer summed up the general mood living in as deeply republican entrenched state as idaho is it s likely not just democrats who feel that way _meta_end_dot_

 even some republicans are probably coming around to the idea that their representation leaves a lot to be desired _meta_end_dot_

 particularly when the state legislature refuses to keep up with the tremendous changes that idaho s growth is demanding _meta_end_dot_

 for these voters barack obama is about as far away the republicans as they can imagine _meta_end_dot_

 it also makes you wonder if people are listening to the message obama is sending _meta_end_dot_

 walgren doesn t hear we can work together he just doesn t want any more republicans _meta_end_dot_

 this brings me to an important question one raised by sharon fisher at new west that s really the critical question for this state _meta_end_dot_

 bush is likelier to resign in shame before his term is up than obama would would be to win idaho in a general election were he the nominee _meta_end_dot_

 idaho hasn t voted for a democratic president since johnson in _meta_number_ref_ it went for nixon in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 but what the people who turned out to caucus for him last night could do if they were mobilized to work statewide could elect larry larocco to the senate _meta_end_dot_

 it could give idaho s _meta_number_ref_st congressional district back to the democrats _meta_end_dot_

 idaho like many mountain west states is a state of ticket splitters much more like to vote dem down ticket than at the top here s where we come in _meta_end_dot_

 a few weeks ago we announced that markos would be keynoting the idaho state dems frank church banquet and that the daily kos community would be official sponsors of the banquet _meta_end_dot_

 to do our part we re helping out a very cash strapped state party structure _meta_end_dot_

 all the money we raise will go toward their _meta_number_ref_ training budget so their grassroots activists can receive one on one assistance from our field directors _meta_end_dot_

 they can do more outreach to more activists and capture some of those people who caucused last night with our help _meta_end_dot_

 the other nice perk in this is that we ll be sponsoring our fellow bloggers the money we provide will offset the ticket costs for idaho s bloggers allowing them to attend the banquet and definitely spice this party up _meta_end_dot_

 we can give a boost to some of the progressive bloggers who have been working their butts off for thus far very little reward in one of the toughest states in the country _meta_end_dot_

 and we might also just help them take back part of idaho in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 some great idaho caucus blogging has been done by a team of u of washington journalism students i had the pleasure of meeting _meta_end_dot_

 they went to idaho yesterday to caucus watch and have been reporting at seattle politicore
