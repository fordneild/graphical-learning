  flood of votes that is _meta_end_dot_

 with _meta_percent_ref_ of the votes in it looks as though the number of votes in the texas democratic primary will match or slightly exceed john kerry s texas vote total for the _meta_number_ref_ general election _meta_end_dot_

 kerry received _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ votes in texas in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 clinton and obama are at _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ between them so far splitting the counted vote _meta_percent_ref_ to _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 hillary clinton received more votes than all republican candidates combined in texas last night barack obama received nearly as many _meta_end_dot_

 clinton doubled the vote total of republican nominee john mccain obama nearly did as well _meta_end_dot_

 remember this is in texas home of george w _meta_end_dot_

 bush a state where we haven t won a senate race since lloyd bentsen in _meta_number_ref_ or a governor s race since ann richards in _meta_number_ref_ where no democrat has won the state s electoral votes since jimmy carter in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 out of all the phenomenal turnout related numbers we ve seen thus far these have shocked me the most _meta_end_dot_

 texas is the largest republican stronghold in the country and hillary clinton and barack obama are generating unheard of levels of excitement there _meta_end_dot_

 this is borne out not by anecdotal evidence nor by polling numbers but actual votes cast by actual people _meta_end_dot_

 frankly i wouldn t put money on it unless i got good odds but i m starting to think that texas _meta_number_ref_ electoral votes might be in play in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 at any rate the gop has got to be nervous as hell _meta_end_dot_
