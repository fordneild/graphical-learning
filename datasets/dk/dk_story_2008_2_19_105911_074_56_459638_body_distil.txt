  the panic induced by the story in the politico is i think unwarranted _meta_end_dot_

 the whole story is based on the following quote the key parts to me are these if it s not a stalemate well then no worries _meta_end_dot_

 and if it s not happening now well then no worries _meta_end_dot_

 but if neither candidate has the _meta_number_ref_ delegate votes required to secure the nomination all sewn up then there s not going to be a nominee _meta_end_dot_

 those are the rules _meta_end_dot_

 it doesn t require a numerical tie for it to be a stalemate _meta_end_dot_

 it just requires that no candidate gets _meta_number_ref_ votes _meta_end_dot_

 we ll know several months in advance of the convention whether anyone has some combination of pledged delegates and superdelegates that gets them to _meta_number_ref_ and we ll know just as far in advance if no one does _meta_end_dot_

 and if no one does it will be the responsibility of the candidates to get themselves there and in all likelihood the sooner the better _meta_end_dot_

 that will require courting any delegates available pledged or unpledged _meta_end_dot_

 while we might prefer that the candidates limit themselves to courting only the unpledged delegates the reality is that the rules permit all delegates pledged or not to cast their votes any way they like _meta_end_dot_

 but again let s look at what triggers this alleged plan a stalemate _meta_end_dot_

 as unlikely as it might be for us to get close to the convention actually still sitting at a stalemate it s not completely out of the question _meta_end_dot_

 if superdelegates fail to commit in sufficient numbers and a stalemate persists the candidates really don t have many choices _meta_end_dot_

 you can sit on your hands for three or more months while the country wonders why democrats can t get their act together and make the race into a four day sprint for delegates scrounged up behind closed doors or you can try to settle the issue ahead of time by recruiting more delegates to your side _meta_end_dot_

 either of the above options would give you the choice of pursuing solely unpledged superdelegates or both pledged and unpledged delegates of course _meta_end_dot_

 and you might even opt to start with the unpledged delegates first _meta_end_dot_

 but the rules are the rules and if any delegate is eligible to switch it d be awfully unwise not to both shore up your hold on your own delegates but also to put out feelers to see if there s anyone who for whatever reason would consider switching _meta_end_dot_

 again though we have to go back to the one and only quote we have to go on and that says if _meta_end_dot_

 if it s a stalemate there s just no other way to get to the nomination _meta_end_dot_

 so is a situation in which no candidate has _meta_number_ref_ pledged delegates and neither has enough superdelegates committed to them to get there a stalemate or is it only a stalemate if neither has _meta_number_ref_ and all remaining superdelegates formally swear a blood oath that they will not commit to one candidate or another before the convention _meta_end_question_

 at what point is it fair game for one or another of the candidates to decide they need to do something they weren t originally planning on and start working to secure the nomination for themselves _meta_end_question_

 and what s fair to do if the superdelegates just aren t moving _meta_end_question_

 unlikely _meta_end_question_

 you bet _meta_end_dot_

 but then again the less likely it is the less you need to worry about delegate poaching because the plan only becomes operative in the event of that unlikely stalemate _meta_end_dot_

 we only have this one quote to go on and it seems a stretch to read the part about the existence of the plan as gospel truth but the part about it not happening now and it only happening in the event of a stalemate as if it had never been said _meta_end_dot_

 update _meta_number_ref_ the obama campaign has its response out now too had to go to tpm to get that response though _meta_end_dot_

 not that i m on anyone s list or anything _meta_end_dot_

 but a hat tip to well peter daou at the clinton campaign for pointing me to it _meta_end_dot_
