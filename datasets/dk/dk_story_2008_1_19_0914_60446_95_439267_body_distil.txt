  after reading of how senator clinton responded to the salmon press editorial board s query about whose portraits she would hang in the white house some of us contributing editors got to wondering which portraits we would hang _meta_end_dot_

 the panoply of guys on mount rushmore got a few thumbs up _meta_end_dot_

 as did fdr _meta_end_dot_

 lbj too despite his well you know little excursion into vietnam _meta_end_dot_

 not too surprisingly this democrat on the right didn t get any votes _meta_end_dot_

 if i got to live in the white house ha ha i d pick lincoln and fdr and maybe jefferson _meta_end_dot_

 but teddy roosevelt wouldn t make the cut _meta_end_dot_

 although he did a bang up job busting corrupt trusts and pushing the preservationist brand of environmentalism he was also a major imperialist and interventionst see the roosevelt corollary a hater of us savage indians and an aggressive accumulator of more executive power for the presidency than anybody since lincoln who had an awfully good excuse thus getting the imperial presidency off to its dashing _meta_number_ref_th century start _meta_end_dot_

 my demurrer i know puts me at odds with most historians who rank tr rather highly in the presidential pantheon _meta_end_dot_

 if you were president which predecessors portraits would you hang _meta_end_question_
