  can you imagine being gang raped and then imprisoned by your employer _meta_end_question_

 can you imagine being the father who got this phone call _meta_end_question_

 but as wrenching and outrageous as the individual human story is the grotesque immorality of the system it reveals is harder still to wrap your mind around _meta_end_dot_

 an american woman employed by an american company was raped by her coworkers _meta_end_dot_

 in order apparently to keep her from reporting the rape her employer held her captive in conditions worse than criminals in prison face _meta_end_dot_

 the rapists are not being prosecuted maybe cannot be prosecuted because the us has left contractors in iraq unanswerable to the law _meta_end_dot_

 the physical evidence of rape has been disappeared _meta_end_dot_

 the company is not being prosecuted for imprisoning her _meta_end_dot_

 they furthermore are insisting that her employment contract means she cannot sue them but has to go into a secret arbitration process massively stacked in their own favor _meta_end_dot_

 we ve heard a lot of it before with blackwater guards not being held accountable for killing iraqis and blackwater not being held accountable by the us government _meta_end_dot_

 but as wrong as it is to try to cover up for having murdered a lot of people by claiming that they shot at you first those people are dead _meta_end_dot_

 you re criminally trying to cover your own ass but you re not causing them any further suffering _meta_end_dot_

 it takes a special something it seems to me to say we don t want to be held accountable for the gang rape of this woman we employ _meta_end_dot_

 hey let s lock her up under armed guard without food and water what was the end game there _meta_end_question_

 was the intent to let her out once they d broken her and she wasn t going to report it _meta_end_question_

 did they even have a plan _meta_end_question_

 and this mind you wasn t a matter of the rapists themselves trying to cover up their actions _meta_end_dot_

 this was a decision made by someone high up enough in the company to assign guards to a damn storage container _meta_end_dot_

 this is what the government of our country has bought and paid for _meta_end_dot_
