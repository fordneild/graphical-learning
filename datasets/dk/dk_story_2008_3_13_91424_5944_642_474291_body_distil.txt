  why is a co chair of the dccc s red to blue program blathering to the press about her inability nay refusal to help fellow democrats _meta_end_question_

 if this truly is such a sensitive issue debbie dubya could at least have kept things quiet and handled matters privately in chris van hollen s office _meta_end_dot_

 instead for no reason at all she chose to make a big public mess of it _meta_end_dot_

 and things like this have serious repercussions no shit _meta_end_dot_

 bizarre public confessionals like debbie dubya s can have a devastating impact on promising challengers like our south florida trio especially with big donors and establishment players _meta_end_dot_

 is it too much to ask key democratic leaders not to air their dirty laundry down at lincoln road mall _meta_end_question_

 debbie dubya herself said at the end of the day we need a member who isn t going to pull any punches who isn t going to be hesitant we also need someone who is savvy enough to know when to keep his or her mouth shut for the duration of the campaign cycle _meta_end_dot_

 it s bad enough that wasserman schultz is kneecapping excellent candidates _meta_end_dot_

 her inability to refrain from cracking out of turn is another reason why she should step down from her post unless she does a _meta_number_ref_ on this and vocally supports raul martinez joe garcia and annette taddeo just like proud democrats everywhere are doing _meta_end_dot_
