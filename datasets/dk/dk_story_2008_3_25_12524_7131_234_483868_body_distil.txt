  while obama spends a couple of days in the virgin islands recharging for the stretch run you may have noticed that clinton s schedule and that of her surrogate in chief bill has been heavy on north carolina and indiana _meta_end_dot_

 i was going to write about how obama has already won the expectations game in pennsylvania and with clinton expected to win handily there it would offer nary a boost to her efforts _meta_end_dot_

 but new york magazine s john heilemann beat me to it _meta_end_dot_

 obama could short circuit this process by losing pennsylvania narrowly or winning of course and he can gain momentum into north carolina and indiana by losing by just _meta_number_ref_ points or so _meta_end_dot_

 it s a much better position to be in than in texas and ohio where he had two weeks to transform large double digit deficits into victories in order to cleanly punt clinton from the race _meta_end_dot_

 but regardless this may be were it all comes down two weeks after pennsylvania on may _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 both indiana and north carolina should favor obama _meta_end_dot_

 if he can t close the race out there then it gives clinton an excuse to fight on no matter what the math and accordant reality have to say _meta_end_dot_
