  ol dennis wants a recount i find it somewhat amusing that so many people are demanding the taxpayers of new hampshire indulge their paranoia by paying for a recount _meta_end_dot_

 what i m not seeing however is an effort to raise the money to pay for such a recount _meta_end_dot_

 it seems that no one wants to put their money where their mouth is _meta_end_dot_

 it s much easier to spread rumors and baseless allegations than it is to actually do something concrete about it _meta_end_dot_

 apparently dennis doesn t know simple subtraction since he lost by significantly more than three percentage points _meta_end_dot_

 but i do hope he antes up the rest of the recount fee _meta_end_dot_

 and i d love to see the fraudsters raising the money to help kucinich pay for this thing _meta_end_dot_

 i m always much more impressed by action than talk _meta_end_dot_

 furthermore if the recount shows troubles with the vote counts the state should reimburse kucinich for the costs of the recount _meta_end_dot_

 but if as expected the recount confirms the original results might it be too much to ask that the fraudsters wait for real evidence before making wild baseless accusations _meta_end_question_

 as dhinmi wrote yesterday again if the people making unsupported allegations want to pay for a recount all the power to them _meta_end_dot_

 that s not a bad thing that s a good thing _meta_end_dot_

 but ante up the cash _meta_end_dot_

 if they are so convinced that fraud exists they can even justify the expense as an opportunity to have me and other skeptics in the reality based community eat some serious crow _meta_end_dot_

 but other than kucinich putting a _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ down payment toward the cost of that recount i haven t seen any efforts to raise that money _meta_end_dot_
