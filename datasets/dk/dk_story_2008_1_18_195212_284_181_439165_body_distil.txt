  from crashing the gate page _meta_number_ref_ yes republicans had ideas _meta_end_dot_

 yes they were looking outside conventional wisdom for solutions to problems _meta_end_dot_

 yes they were bad ideas _meta_end_dot_

 he just said they had ideas _meta_end_dot_

 and they did _meta_end_dot_

 their entire movement was built on them like it or not _meta_end_dot_
