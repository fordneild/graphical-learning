  rhode island i m convinced arg just pulls numbers out of its ass _meta_end_dot_

 i do that too but i m not a pollster _meta_end_dot_

 that said rass seems to confirm the significant clinton lead _meta_end_dot_

 in fact if i had to bet i d bet that rhode island is the state that stops obama s winning streak _meta_end_dot_

 vermont no surprise there _meta_end_dot_

 texas i said last week when polls still gave clinton the narrow advantage in texas that obama would win it by _meta_number_ref_ if the election was last week _meta_end_dot_

 today i say he d win by _meta_number_ref_ if the election was tomorrow _meta_end_dot_

 these polls are completely failing to capture the breath and depth of obama s ground game and the excitement he is generating _meta_end_dot_

 but if nothing else they re capturing the obvious movement in obama s direction _meta_end_dot_

 oh and arg sucks _meta_end_dot_

 ohio unlike texas where i m fairly confident of the obama advantage regardless what the polls might say i m less sure about what s going on in ohio _meta_end_dot_

 if the election were tomorrow i d guess a _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ point clinton victory _meta_end_dot_

 i m also less sure about the trendlines _meta_end_dot_

 sure obama is gaining but clinton is also holding her support _meta_end_dot_

 and given she s around the _meta_number_ref_ percent mark obama can t win unless _meta_number_ref_ she starts weakening or _meta_number_ref_ obama s turnout operation is better than clinton s _meta_end_dot_

 if the election was tomorrow i d expect big obama wins in texas and vermont a big clinton win in rhode island and a narrow clinton win in ohio _meta_end_dot_

 enough to keep her in the race _meta_end_question_

 hardly especially given what will be worsening money problems and a prohibitive deficit in delegates and the popular vote _meta_end_dot_

 but who knows _meta_end_dot_

 and yes arg sucks _meta_end_dot_
