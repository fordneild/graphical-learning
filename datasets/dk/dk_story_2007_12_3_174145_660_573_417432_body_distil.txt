  former speaker dennis hastert bailed out early on his constituents and is sticking the taxpayers of illinois for the cost of a special election _meta_end_dot_

 had he bailed earlier our chances of picking up his seat would have been greater because the special election might have been on february _meta_number_ref_th _meta_end_dot_

 that s the day of the presidential primary in il when turnout should be huge especially if home state senator barack obama is still in the hunt for the nomination _meta_end_dot_

 but we ve gotten a decent plan b as blagojevich has called the primary for february _meta_number_ref_th with the general election on saturday march _meta_number_ref_th _meta_end_dot_

 il _meta_number_ref_ is a solid but not overwhelmingly republican seat _meta_end_dot_

 winning a seat where bush pulled _meta_percent_ref_ in _meta_number_ref_ won t be easy _meta_end_dot_

 but as we re seeing in oh _meta_number_ref_ the dccc isn t afraid to go after seats that should be republican and the deficit spending nrcc is sufficiently afraid of not holding on to seats that should be safe that they re spending even deeper in to the hole _meta_end_dot_

 holding the primary on february _meta_number_ref_th gives democrats an opportunity to do some work that would increase our chance of taking this seat _meta_end_dot_

 even if the democratic primary field is winnowed down to two by super tuesday there will still probably be high turnout and if obama is one of the two democrats left democratic turnout will probably set records _meta_end_dot_

 many activists will be working for one of the presidential candidates and others could be working for the democrats running in the il _meta_number_ref_ primary _meta_end_dot_

 but hopefully there will be other activists available to talk with voters as they leave polling sites determine if they re democrats and sign them up to volunteer for the special election _meta_end_dot_

 it would make sense to have democratic volunteers sitting with the election workers checking in voters and getting the list of people who voted in the democratic primary this group would be the core of the gotv universe _meta_end_dot_

 especially at the more democratic voting sites voters should be handed literature after they vote on their way out reminding them of the special election on march _meta_number_ref_th _meta_end_dot_

 as i said this isn t a seat that will be easy to win _meta_end_dot_

 but with the presidential primary just one month earlier democrats have an excellent opportunity to do serious grass roots organizing volunteer recruitment and excellent gotv _meta_end_dot_

 let s hope the illinois democrats seize the opportunity _meta_end_dot_
