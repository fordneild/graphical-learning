  thank you all very much _meta_end_dot_

 we re very proud to be back here _meta_end_dot_

 during the spring of _meta_number_ref_ i had the extraordinary experience of bringing _meta_number_ref_ college kids here to new orleans to work _meta_end_dot_

 these are kids who gave up their spring break to come to new orleans to work to rehabilitate houses because of their commitment as americans because they believed in what was possible and because they cared about their country _meta_end_dot_

 i began my presidential campaign here to remind the country that we as citizens and as a government have a moral responsibility to each other and what we do together matters _meta_end_dot_

 we must do better if we want to live up to the great promise of this country that we all love so much _meta_end_dot_

 continued beneath the fold
