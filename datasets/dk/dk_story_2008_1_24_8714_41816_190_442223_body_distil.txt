  let s start a new list shall we _meta_end_question_

 we already have a list of the _meta_number_ref_ lies that the bush administration used to sell the iraq war to the american people _meta_end_dot_

 let s look at the lies that the bush administration is using to manipulate congress into voting for another ill conceived and shameful policy _meta_end_dot_

 there was of course the initial lie _meta_end_dot_

 that domestic spying was limited to people with known links to al qaeda and related terrorist organizations then we learned the truth that the net cast was much wider covering millions of american phone calls _meta_end_dot_

 then there was the lie that the fisa wasn t flexible enough _meta_end_dot_

 the truth of course was that spying could take place without a warrant for _meta_number_ref_ hours _meta_end_dot_

 and then there was the lie that gosh darn there was just too much paperwork to fill out with each fisa application _meta_end_dot_

 even though the truth was that bush administration was able to fill out over _meta_number_ref_ of those applications since _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ the total applications in the fisa court s _meta_number_ref_ year history _meta_end_question_

 _meta_number_ref_ then there was the lie that the government could have prevented the _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ attacks had it not had to ask the fisa court for a wiretap _meta_end_dot_

 but the truth was that the failure to tap moussaoui was a result of a clumsy fbi and not a paralyzed doj _meta_end_dot_

 then there was the lie that this domestic spying program was necessary in the wake of _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ but the truth is that the bush administration approached the telecoms as early as february _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 the most repulsive lie however is that telecoms who aided the administration in turning this nation s massive spying apparatus on its own citizens were just doing their patriotic duty when asked to let the government into their buildings and into their networks and into the privacy of americans without a warrant or court order the telecoms jumped into action _meta_end_dot_

 they bravely opened their doors valiantly opened their networks and gee the only thing that was missing was attaching an american flag to each telephone pole and placing a fresh baked apple pie at the foot of each tower _meta_end_dot_

 republicans would have their democratic colleagues buy into this lie just as they have bought into so many others _meta_end_dot_

 but does this sound like a company whose heart is bursting with patriotism _meta_end_question_

 ah can you smell the sweet sweet smell of patriotism unadulterated by selfish corporate concerns _meta_end_exclamation_

 if the telecoms break the law they shouldn t face the consequences _meta_end_dot_

 but if the government breaks its contract with the telecoms well hey that fisa wiretap wasn t that important anyway _meta_end_dot_

 and what s a little lost evidence between uber patriotic friends _meta_end_question_

 there isn t a flag pin big enough to cover the truth here _meta_end_dot_

 the same patriotism that was used to ram the patriot act though a quivering congress the same patriotism that was used to silence criticism of a reckless president deadset on taking this nation to war the same patriotism that was used and is used to bully our elected officials into continuing to fund the iraq debacle that same patriotism is now being used to sweep an illegal massive domestic spying program under the carpet _meta_end_dot_

 as senator dodd and others have repeatedly emphasized the telecoms already have a good faith defense which can protect them from pending and future domestic spying lawsuits _meta_end_dot_

 slathering on a layer of telecom amnesty over that serves no purpose but to suffocate the rule of law excuse illegal conduct and shield this administration s actions from judicial scrutiny _meta_end_dot_

 and for members of congress who embrace this endeavor _meta_end_question_

 for those who contend that rewarding those selfless telecoms who have acted in a most selfish manner is the proper way to proceed _meta_end_question_

 for them for those in congress who appear to be suspended a state of perpetual gullibility for those who bought _meta_number_ref_ lies and stand ready to buy hundreds more at the expense of the american people for them there is no flag pin large enough to hide their shame _meta_end_dot_

 there is no flag waving high enough to overshadow their misjudgment and there is above all else no red white and blue excuse for blacking out the truth about how this government has treated its people _meta_end_dot_
