  t he first step is to firmly bind the prisoner to the table _meta_end_dot_

 the ropes or straps should be tight enough to prevent any struggling that could injure either interrogators or the prisoner himself arms legs and torso should all be restrained _meta_end_dot_

 in addition to ropes or straps it may also be desirable for several interrogators to physically restrain the prisoner using their own weight use caution to prevent accidental suffocation however _meta_end_dot_

 proper restraint of the head is essential _meta_end_dot_

 the prisoner s head must be kept facing forward and immobile using either bindings or physical effort by interrogators _meta_end_dot_

 the table should be inclined backwards so that the prisoner s head is below the level of his chest _meta_end_dot_

 in addition to allowing water to properly pool in the subject s throat and sinuses and allowing water to be inhaled into then drained from the lungs this position enhances the sense of disorientation during the process _meta_end_dot_

 ideally it should be possible to quickly level the table and or release the subject s head from restraints in the event that the prisoner vomits or aspirates excessive amounts of water _meta_end_dot_

 consider the setting the interrogation should be done in a location chosen to elicit maximum fear from the prisoner _meta_end_dot_

 for some prisoners a sterile medical like environment will create the greatest sense of terror for others a damp and dimly lit basement room will prove more alarming and disorienting _meta_end_dot_

 interrogators may wish to wear hoods or masks in order to increase this feeling and to prevent the prisoner from identifying his captors _meta_end_dot_

 the object of this technique is to strike irresistible panic into the prisoner in order to best solicit information from the otherwise hostile subject the more that sense of terror can be instilled before the physical process begins the more quickly the prisoner will respond to the physical trauma therefore lessening the duration of the technique and in turn lessening the chances of physical damage or death _meta_end_dot_

 creating an environment of extreme emotional stress and terror then is doing a distinct favor to your prisoner sparing him from as much physical injury as possible _meta_end_dot_

 at this point it is important to note that properly done this technique is not torture _meta_end_dot_

 it has been carefully reviewed by the highest levels of the united states government and found to be neither cruel or unusual nor in violation of international law but a reasonable enhancement of modern interrogation techniques _meta_end_dot_
