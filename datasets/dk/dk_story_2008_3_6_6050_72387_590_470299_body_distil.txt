  isn t the asset or albatross question kind of rhetorical by now _meta_end_question_

 john mccain will surely attempt to tap dance around the situation likely keeping the president on the sidelines but allowing him to steadily fundraise for him _meta_end_dot_

 that the president and his failed presidency are indeed an albatross is beyond dispute on both sides of the aisle which is why this advice is pretty universal that will be an uphill battle _meta_end_dot_

 mccain s campaign thus far is a already a mimicry of the president s philosophy and presidency _meta_end_dot_

 sure the black and white simplicity of the president s speeches have been replaced by a convoluted entanglement of cliches and stale oratory _meta_end_dot_

 but if you stay awake long enough you ll hear that the basic premise the proposed philosophy of governing is the exact same _meta_end_dot_

 keep feeding the war in iraq with more lives and more money and keep catering to the privileged at the expense of the american middle class _meta_end_dot_

 john mccain s central problem is that iraq is the center of his campaign _meta_end_dot_

 the iraq debacle is so intimately tied to the president in our national consciousness that it s all but impossible for mccain to take the president out of the equation _meta_end_dot_

 he cannot claim that withdrawal is not an option and prattle on about dates of surrender without echoing the very president he seeks to avoid _meta_end_dot_

 simply put as a supporter of the surge and of continued war he cannot talk about iraq without sounding like george w _meta_end_dot_

 bush _meta_end_dot_

 which means that even if mccain keeps the president out of sight on the campaign trail the glum prospect of a third bush term will be on the minds of voters every time john mccain opens his mouth _meta_end_dot_
