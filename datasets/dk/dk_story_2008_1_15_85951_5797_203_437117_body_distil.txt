  when it was announced that the new york times had hired william kristol to peddle his neocon fantasies to a wider audience editorial page editor andy rosenthal defended the move saying leaving aside the fact that kristol is respected only within the walls of the white house fox news and the like one wonders if it occured to mr _meta_end_dot_

 rosenthal that that intolerance isn t because of kristol s conservatism but his record _meta_end_dot_

 that kristol s beating of the drum for war with iraq writing nearly _meta_number_ref_ columns advocating the overthrow of saddam hussein in the year between september _meta_number_ref_th and the aumf vote with claims of wmd anthrax attacks in the u s _meta_end_dot_

 and of course iraq s involvement in september _meta_number_ref_th itself may have caused that mistrust _meta_end_dot_

 and that the nearly five years of claims of turning points pivotal moments and happy days in iraq make it impossible to take his intellect seriously _meta_end_dot_

 or we re intolerant _meta_end_dot_

 and now in his second effort as a new york times columnist william kristol gives a scolding to democrats for refusing to celebrate the latest impending victory in iraq _meta_end_dot_

 of course kristol doesn t say that june was a period where american casualties were at their highest levels of the war making that _meta_number_ref_ percent decrease a lot less impressive and naturally kristol failed to mention that because saying that _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ people were killed would make it harder to spin his fairy tale _meta_end_dot_

 and as clinton and obama have both pointed out the purpose of the surge was to reduce the violence so political reconciliation could occur _meta_end_dot_

 aha says kristol but if kristol would have bothered to read the pages of his new employer he would have known that it seems that the harping can continue _meta_end_dot_

 and how is the rest of bush s not open ended commitment working out bill _meta_end_question_

 last january when bush announced his escalation he said that the iraqi government would be responsible for security throughout iraq by november that oil revenue sharing would be enacted and that provincial elections would be held in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 that s zero for four in key benchmarks for success in iraq _meta_end_dot_

 which makes william kristol wrong _meta_end_dot_

 again _meta_end_dot_
