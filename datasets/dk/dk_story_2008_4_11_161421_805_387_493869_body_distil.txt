  thank goodness for chris matthews pea sized brain and ginormous mouth just when that nyt profile had me feeling a little bad for him as a deeply insecure guy who secretly suspects he s outreaching his actual abilities he reaffirms exactly why i loathe him _meta_end_dot_

 media matters transcript there are too many problems to begin to address here _meta_end_dot_

 i mean never mind getting paid for this shit they aren t fired immediately for wasting the resources of their employer _meta_end_question_

 these are the guardians of our public political discourse _meta_end_question_

 my mind can t even begin to encompass the outrage of meaningful questions like that so rather than attempting to dissect the vapidity of a form that thinks discussing what a candidate ordered in a diner is reasonable political commentary let s think about the substance such as it is of what matthews and shuster said _meta_end_dot_

 first of all at the most concrete practical level possible obama is there to shake hands _meta_end_dot_

 but he should order two drinks _meta_end_question_

 with what appendage can we then expect him to shake hands _meta_end_question_

 wouldn t you love to see the reporting on that shuster and matthews all atwitter that obama didn t shake people s hands because he got greedy with the beverages _meta_end_dot_

 second suddenly coffee drinking is a requirement of candidacy _meta_end_question_

 what s up with the oj scorn _meta_end_question_

 do matthews and shuster hate florida and the other fine orange producing states of this great nation _meta_end_question_

 third substitute doesn t mean what matthews thinks it means _meta_end_dot_

 so i m going to school him on that one _meta_end_dot_

 but first to establish my regular guy authority to speak of diners i will note that in each of the last two towns i ve lived in there s been a diner waitress who knew my regular order a substitution is when you re ordering a meal and ask to have one of the components of said meal replaced with another _meta_end_dot_

 perhaps you ask for fresh fruit to replace the bacon in your lumberjack breakfast to choose a hearty regular guy eating a big meal example that i predict will send a thrill up tweety s leg _meta_end_dot_

 asking for orange juice as a stand alone order _meta_end_question_

 not substituting _meta_end_dot_

 and if your waitress likes you an experience tweety may never have had you damn well can substitute _meta_end_dot_

 no those idiots are the ones who don t know how you work a damn diner _meta_end_dot_

 shoot they apparently don t know how you order in one _meta_end_dot_
