  yeah i know you re already sick of these pitches _meta_end_dot_

 we re sick of making them _meta_end_dot_

 but this stuff matters _meta_end_dot_

 it really does _meta_end_dot_

 democrats in congress were running scared on fisa while republicans and bush demanded retroactive immunity for lawbreaking telecommunication companies that had spied on us _meta_end_dot_

 chris dodd made a courageous stand on the floor of the senate and bought us some time _meta_end_dot_

 but at the time it was all we were getting a bit of extra time _meta_end_dot_

 republicans cackled in glee _meta_end_dot_

 democrats were weak on national security _meta_end_exclamation_

 the voters would punish us _meta_end_exclamation_

 they ran millions of ads against our most vulnerable freshmen democrats on the issue _meta_end_dot_

 they thought they had a winner _meta_end_dot_

 then we got behind bill foster in il _meta_number_ref_ the conservative district held by the former republican speaker of the house _meta_end_dot_

 foster came out courageously against retroactive immunity _meta_end_dot_

 republicans pounced accusing foster of being soft on national security and opening america s doors to the terrorists _meta_end_dot_

 we know how that played out _meta_end_dot_

 foster won _meta_end_dot_

 the message was sent _meta_end_dot_

 a week later the house held firm and refused to cave to bush republican pressure on retroactive immunity passing a new fisa bill stripped of such protections _meta_end_dot_

 they had seen first hand that all the sound and fury the gop generated on the issue wasn t worth a hill of beans to voters _meta_end_dot_

 we knew this already _meta_end_dot_

 we just had to send that message in a way our representatives in dc understood by winning an election on the issue _meta_end_dot_

 the next day many of our blue majority candidates celebrated that victory _meta_end_dot_

 here s dan seals email to his list remember when we started this battle democrats were eager to cave on retroactive immunity so we could get it off the table and focus on bread and butter issues that voters care about _meta_end_dot_

 we taught them through hard work that voters do care about their constitution they do care about protecting our nation s most sacred document _meta_end_dot_

 and now our blue majority candidates and so many others like them are running on the issue _meta_end_exclamation_

 that was us people _meta_end_dot_

 that was our efforts _meta_end_dot_

 we had invaluable allies like the aclu and the incomparable chris dodd with us on this battle but this wouldn t have happened without our tireless efforts on behalf of our constitution and probably would ve been a hell of a lot more difficult without foster s dramatic victory in il _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 the more victories we win like this one the more democrats will realize that it pays to be unapologetically progressive _meta_end_dot_

 they ve been told for so long that this is a conservative nation that they ve been long afraid to do the right thing on so many issues _meta_end_dot_

 we re teaching them that they can that it pays political dividends and that it feels good _meta_end_dot_

 so let s do it people _meta_end_dot_

 let s chip in our _meta_dollor_ref_ or _meta_dollor_ref_ or _meta_dollor_ref_ to the cause _meta_end_dot_

 i know everyone is focused on obama clinton but obama will need support in congress to change this country for the better _meta_end_dot_

 this is a multi front battle and we short change ourselves if we forget about the myriad battles around the country _meta_end_dot_

 so give to your favorite candidates _meta_end_dot_

 whether they re on blue majority or another actblue list or whether you give directly to them _meta_end_dot_

 it doesn t matter _meta_end_dot_

 just do it _meta_end_dot_
