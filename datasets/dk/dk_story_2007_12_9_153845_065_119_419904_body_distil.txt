  two statements this morning by republican presidential candidates demonstrate how far right the radicals have moved the gop since _meta_number_ref_ is this an example of what huckabee means by politically correct as some of you may remember that wasn t something said at a democratic convention _meta_end_dot_

 the speaker was mary fisher the daughter of a prominent republican donor who had contracted hiv from her ex husband and she was speaking to the gop convention in houston _meta_end_dot_

 earlier that year fisher had contributed to the gop platform mike huckabee s ignorance was inexcusable in _meta_number_ref_ when he was out of step with his party s national platform _meta_end_dot_

 in the _meta_number_ref_ years since we ve learned much about aids and the stigmas and ignorance about hiv and aids while still there have somewhat faded especially as a matter of public health and public policy _meta_end_dot_

 but mike huckabee s ignorance is just as stunning _meta_end_dot_

 note that he refused to acknowledge that he was wrong in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 he simply says that today he would state his view differently _meta_end_dot_

 mike huckabee is one of the leading candidates to be rewarded by republican voters with their nomination to be the next president of the united states _meta_end_dot_

 due to his sex on the city scandal america s playa rudy giuliani is probably done _meta_end_dot_

 but he knows that with the radically rightwing gop his only chance is to mollify the republican base _meta_end_dot_

 he s been doing that all along on issues that appeal to the gop s authoritarianism _meta_end_dot_

 he s been speaking in code on abortion rights by saying the would appoint justices like antonin scalia and samuel alito _meta_end_dot_

 and this morning he essentially said f_meta_beep_ref_ you to gays and lesbians and to anyone who rejects the incursion of religious intolerance in to politics that position is essentially the position of the roman catholic church and possibly other religious institutions _meta_end_dot_

 it s not sinful for a man to be sexually attracted to other men according to this view it s only sinful if a man acts on that sexual attraction _meta_end_dot_

 this from a guy who when he was kicked out of the house after cheating on his wife shacked up with a gay couple and who for all his faults was generally as you would expect from any mayor of nyc tolerant of gays and lesbians _meta_end_dot_

 but knowing that his only chance to get the nomination is to expand his appeal beyond authoritarianism to social intolerance he adopted the religious language of sin to condemn gays and lesbians _meta_end_dot_

 i won t condemn giuliani s action with the language of sin _meta_end_dot_

 i ll use the language of commerce on issues of social tolerance rudy giuliani is a whore _meta_end_dot_
