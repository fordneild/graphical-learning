  blue majority candidate dan maffei s lone republican candidate has just dropped out _meta_end_dot_

 i d say this is good news but the republican dropped out after suffering a mini stroke and there s nothing good about that _meta_end_dot_

 regardless it does put republicans in a serious bind leaving retiring republican rep _meta_end_dot_

 jim walsh s competitive open seat without a candidate _meta_end_dot_

 the filing deadline is july _meta_number_ref_ so the gop still has plenty of time to find someone to lose against maffei _meta_end_dot_

 but their top possibilities have all begged off _meta_end_dot_

 no serious republican wants to run in this toxic environment and especially not in an indigo blue state like new york in a presidential year _meta_end_dot_

 but here s what we can do to improve the chances that maffei faces no serious competitor this year head over to our blue majority and drop some coin into his kitty _meta_end_dot_

 the bigger his q_meta_number_ref_ numbers the less likely that any serious republican will decide to tackle him head on _meta_end_dot_

 guys this election cycle isn t over _meta_end_dot_

 but we can help nail this seat down this week _meta_end_dot_

 so let s put this one away _meta_end_dot_
