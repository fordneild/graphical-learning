  phil kline was the kansas attorney general where he used his perch to legally harass his state s abortion clinics _meta_end_dot_

 the kansas electorate in large part because of kline s ham fisted wingnuttery rejected his ass by a nearly _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ margin and elected a pro choice democrat paul morrison instead _meta_end_dot_

 he was even busted pre election sending memos to churches coaching them on how to better help the gop s electoral chances _meta_end_dot_

 however that wasn t the end of kline _meta_end_dot_

 a month later johnson county needed a replacement for morrison who still had two years left in his previous office of county district attorney _meta_end_dot_

 in a move that still perplexes me the johnson county republican precinct committeepersons got to decide on morrison s replacement and chose phil kline who wasn t even from that county _meta_end_dot_

 aside from the question regarding why republicans got to make the choice like i said i have no clue kline s nomination was yet another example of the fierce battle inside the kansas gop over the crazy wingnutters the ones who periodically take over the state s board of education and wage war on science and moderates _meta_end_dot_

 the moderates have been abandoning the party in droves becoming democrats and experiencing a great deal of success at the ballot box morrison was one of those _meta_end_dot_

 the hard liners _meta_end_question_

 well they become johnson county district attorney _meta_end_dot_

 and what do they get from that deal _meta_end_question_

 apparently not much _meta_end_dot_

 wow _meta_end_dot_

 that s pretty bad _meta_end_dot_

 but there s more _meta_end_dot_

 this is one neat wingnut case study all wrapped up in a tight little package _meta_end_dot_

 disdain for the law _meta_end_question_

 check _meta_end_dot_

 lies to cover up said disdain _meta_end_question_

 check _meta_end_dot_

 incompetence _meta_end_question_

 check _meta_end_dot_

 well i m assuming he s not being extra efficient whenever he bothers to show up for work whatever it is you call installing him as county da when he doesn t live in the county nor was he supported by the county s public _meta_end_question_

 check _meta_end_dot_

 expecting the public to pay for your wingnutty single minded agenda to the tune of _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ per year _meta_end_question_

 check _meta_end_dot_

 it s not just kline who is a terrible joke a monument to corruption and incompetence but also the party of his that has coddled and supported his efforts _meta_end_dot_
