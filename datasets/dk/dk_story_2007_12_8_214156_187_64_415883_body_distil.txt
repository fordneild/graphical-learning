  in a combination of bush administration fatigue and campaign season fatigue lately a number of political cliches have begun grating on me _meta_end_dot_

 it s tough when a particular state of political being drags on and on and on we all run out of new words to describe it _meta_end_dot_

 nonetheless there are a few phrases i m ready to declare tired and mockable and i m sure other people will have plenty to add _meta_end_dot_

 lately a lot of things have been dying rhetorically _meta_end_dot_

 democracy has died the constitution has died innocence has died _meta_end_dot_

 whether rumors of those deaths are exaggerated or not repetition has certainly killed the effectiveness of that phrase _meta_end_dot_

 the third rail of american politics recently social security and immigration have been battling it out for the title of third rail of american politics but medicare and a number of other issues have been so called _meta_end_dot_

 in fact gelf magazine actually compiled a list a few months ago finding references to _meta_number_ref_ third rails other than those i ve mentioned _meta_end_dot_

 does the phrase even have real meaning to people who don t spend much time in one of a few large cities _meta_end_question_

 or who didn t see beat street at an impressionable age i guess those are my candidates for political cliches that must go _meta_end_dot_

 yours _meta_end_question_
