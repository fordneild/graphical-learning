  nobody boils it down or tracks the atrocities like atrios broder has just been pantsed here but no one in the village will just say so _meta_end_dot_

 that of course is the point of atrios posts but isn t it amazing how the arbiters of neutral objective reporting never neutrally or objectively mention how broder s predictions and pronouncements are increasingly divorced from reality _meta_end_question_

 how odd it is that the serious people of the nation continue to set their watches by his word _meta_end_dot_

 for the umpteenth time he s just been duped into carrying republican water in all likelihood with no intention whatsoever of doubling back and standing up for what was so reasonable _meta_number_ref_ days ago _meta_end_dot_

 everyone knows what comes next _meta_end_dot_

 graham will beg off of his marker if anyone even notices it at all and fold like a cheap suit and even if he doesn t the president won t give a crap one way or the other _meta_end_dot_

 and broder will find some other line of bull to pronounce reasonable so that america clings for hope to the words of some other one of his lunch partners for the next three to six months _meta_end_dot_

 because broder and his giant glasses very serious while you and objective truth dirty f ing hippie _meta_end_dot_
