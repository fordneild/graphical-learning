  the polls show obama rising edwards falling and hillary holding steady in what is still essentially a three way tie for first in the first caucus state _meta_end_dot_

 as jerome points out richardson s _meta_number_ref_ percent will have a big role in the outcome if the numbers remain static for the duration of this race _meta_end_dot_

 their second choice could prove determinate _meta_end_dot_

 or he could do what kucinich did in _meta_number_ref_ and throw his supporters to another candidate to play kingmaker _meta_end_dot_

 kucinich threw his to the then pro war edwards in order to block dean _meta_end_dot_

 over at iowa independent they compiled a list of who they think would win the caucuses based on what they re seeing on the ground on the other hand big tent democrat thinks edwards is looking more like gephardt _meta_number_ref_ than a caucus winner _meta_end_dot_

 as for me i think it s folly to try and predict the caucuses especially with three strong contenders all looking pretty good and the caucus date within new year s eve hangover territory _meta_end_dot_

 and none look too solid _meta_end_dot_

 edwards is on a slight downward trajectory _meta_end_dot_

 both hillary and obama get big support from voters who haven t previously attended a caucus _meta_end_dot_

 obama is depending on the potentially less reliable youth vote _meta_end_dot_

 does anyone know where richardson voters will go after their guy loses _meta_end_question_

 old people seem to be breaking for biden who will be their second choice _meta_end_question_

 any of the top three can win at this point _meta_end_dot_

 but of course in the comments the candidate partisans will claim their guy is the only guy who can win the general and the rest are doomed to defeat by the republican boogeyman _meta_end_dot_

 sigh _meta_end_dot_

 well have at it _meta_end_dot_
