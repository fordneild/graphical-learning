  here is an interesting tidbit from the mississippi exit poll _meta_end_dot_

 look at the percentage of hillary clinton voters who are dissatisfied with the idea of an eventual clinton nomination a full _meta_percent_ref_ of voters who said they will be unsatisfied if she gets the nomination voted for hillary clinton _meta_end_dot_

 in contrast only _meta_percent_ref_ of obama voters say the same about their candidate _meta_end_dot_

 looking at other exit polls we see a similar result _meta_end_dot_

 in ohio for example which was also an open primary _meta_percent_ref_ of those who would be unsatisfied with clinton were clinton supporters while only _meta_percent_ref_ of those unsatisfied with an obama nomination were obama voters _meta_end_dot_

 in texas open primary _meta_percent_ref_ of those unsatisfied with a clinton nod were clinton compared to obama s _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 in tennessee also an open primary _meta_percent_ref_ of those who would be unhappy with clinton as nominee were clinton voters and only _meta_percent_ref_ of those unhappy with an obama candidacy were obama voters _meta_end_dot_

 the phenomenon doesn t appear to be universal in wisconsin for example the numbers break down _meta_percent_ref_ for clinton and _meta_percent_ref_ for obama _meta_end_dot_

 but it is prevalent enough to merit a closer look _meta_end_dot_

 why are so many clinton voters in some states unsatisfied with the prospect of a clinton nomination _meta_end_question_

 does that number reflect republican crossover votes _meta_end_question_

 a little mischief perhaps _meta_end_question_

 after all clinton did dominate the republican vote in mississippi _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 is a certain block of hillary s support in other words an effort to nominate a candidate they think will be weaker in the general election _meta_end_question_

 or on the flip side and less likely i think are some voters picking the candidate they thing will be the strongest even if they don t necessarily like that candidate _meta_end_question_

 the same questions apply to obama s dissatisfied voters of course but to a lesser degree _meta_end_dot_

 update sorry for jumbling the numbers i misread the chart initially _meta_end_dot_

 the post has been slightly tweaked to reflect the correction _meta_end_dot_
