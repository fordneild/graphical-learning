  it will come as news to readers of the denver post but it turns out that the paper is just one more cog in that great liberal media wheel _meta_end_dot_

 at least bob schaffer thinks so _meta_end_dot_

 see the paper has been committing journalism and informing colorado citizens that their former congressman and would be senator has some not so savory ties to jack abramoff _meta_end_dot_

 not to mention that he thinks that the mariana islands provide just a peachy model for an immigration policy for the u s never mind the forced labor rape and other humanitarian abuses _meta_end_dot_

 because the real victim in all of this is yes you guessed it bob schaffer the innocent victim of a vicious newspaper _meta_end_dot_

 ah dick wadhams _meta_end_dot_

 the man who helped george allen through his macaca moment by insisting that the racist slur wasn t a racist slur but just another word for mohawk and referred only to a haircut _meta_end_dot_

 yeah _meta_end_dot_

 here s what dick wadhams has to say about his new boss s um challenge yeah that ll work _meta_end_dot_

 that ll stop them from investigating schaffer s abramoff ties _meta_end_dot_
