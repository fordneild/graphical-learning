  we don t have much power _meta_end_dot_

 in fact we have very little _meta_end_dot_

 as we ve learned this year democrats in dc are more afraid of david broder joe klein and mr _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_percent_ref_ than they are of their constituents _meta_end_dot_

 they are more concerned with beltway opinion than they are with the national consensus _meta_end_dot_

 they are happier dealing with lobbyists than they are dealing with real people _meta_end_dot_

 they are more concerned with avoiding criticism than they are of delivering campaign promises _meta_end_dot_

 so what can we do about it _meta_end_question_

 we ve bitched and moan and pleaded and begged and threatened and cried and none of that mattered _meta_end_dot_

 we really can t hold up money since quite frankly we don t have that much and the lobbyists will always have more _meta_end_dot_

 votes _meta_end_question_

 we re an important part of the party s ground game but the most entrenched of our ineffective democrats have been in office _meta_number_ref_ years and in safe districts and have little to fear from you and me staying home too disillusioned to participate _meta_end_dot_

 and they know damn well we d rather hold our nose and vote for them than risk an even viler republican slip in their stead _meta_end_dot_

 so what does that leave us _meta_end_question_

 well we have one tool at our disposal our only way to influence the behavior of our elected officials we can primary them _meta_end_dot_

 defeating joe lieberman sent a shockwave through the political world _meta_end_dot_

 if he could go down in a primary none of them were safe _meta_end_dot_

 and after years of taking the party s base for granted and as ill equipped as they were and still are to listen to us they had to learn or else _meta_end_dot_

 rep _meta_end_dot_

 jane harman having faced a spirited primary in _meta_number_ref_ became _meta_number_ref_ percent better overnight _meta_end_dot_

 she learned her lesson and it made her a better person and legislator _meta_end_dot_

 ellen tauscher threatened with facing a lieberman headed off a potential primary challenge by suddenly voting her democratic district something she had seldom deemed necessary beforehand _meta_end_dot_

 other democrats haven t been so quick to reform and they face spirited primaries _meta_end_dot_

 key among them are of course the incumbents facing spirited challenges by donna edwards in md _meta_number_ref_ and mark pera in il _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 let me say this is no uncertain terms our only ability to influence the democratic caucus in washington d c _meta_end_dot_

 rests in our ability to defeat them in their primaries next year _meta_end_dot_

 no other elections are more important for purposes of our movement as opposed to the nation as a whole than these two _meta_end_dot_

 if dan lipinski and al wynn hold on it will tell other democrats that they have little to fear from us _meta_end_dot_

 if we defeat them it will put the entire caucus on notice that we can and will target them if they lose touch with who they serve i e _meta_end_dot_

 the people not themselves and their lobbyist cocktail party hosts _meta_end_dot_

 if you live in maryland or illinois near either of these districts please join these candidates ground armies and help them fight the establishment forces arrayed against them _meta_end_dot_

 if you don t or can t please consider giving to these races _meta_end_dot_

 you want better democrats _meta_end_question_

 then get involved _meta_end_dot_

 you want leverage against the other democrats _meta_end_question_

 then get involved _meta_end_dot_

 the alternative is more of the hell we ve suffered this year timid but safe congressmen and senators who d rather capitulate rather than fulfill campaign promises _meta_end_dot_

 this is all we ve got guys _meta_end_dot_

 i know it s the holidays and everyone is looking ahead to presents and iowa but how about you drop at least _meta_dollor_ref_ into both or at least one of them _meta_end_question_

 let s give them a numbers boost before the fourth quarter ends and better equip them to fight next year s important battles _meta_end_dot_

 we can worry about electing more democrats later _meta_end_dot_

 right now let s focus on getting better ones _meta_end_dot_

 if we fail in these races we ll have many more years like this disastrous one that is mercifully coming to an end _meta_end_dot_
