  into history back _meta_end_dot_

 with the iowa caucuses only weeks away and rafts of polling data being produced each week here s a tell from four years ago _meta_end_dot_

 in november of _meta_number_ref_ i was turning my calculator into slag as i averaged all the various polls weighted them by past accuracy and freshness of the data then worked through all the various state rules on how delegates where allocated _meta_end_dot_

 by the middle of the month i had it all down _meta_end_dot_

 with trendlines and margins of error all accounted for i knew how the first primaries were going to turn out _meta_end_dot_

 and i had reached one irrevocable decision _meta_end_dot_

 two of the candidates no longer had any chance and were only keeping the party from putting it s efforts behind those more viable in the long run _meta_end_dot_

 that s right _meta_end_dot_

 i proved that it was time for kerry and edwards to get out of the race _meta_end_dot_

 the point of this other than that i m an idiot _meta_end_question_

 nothing is yet decided _meta_end_dot_

 even candidates who look like they stand no chance in november can turn things around very quickly _meta_end_dot_

 so whoever you re supporting get out there and work your butts off through the month of december _meta_end_dot_
