  every member of congress but particularly the chairs of the intelligence committees needs to read today s explosive wall street journal article before considering moving forward on any fisa legislation _meta_end_dot_

 huge amounts of data e mail information sender recipient subject line time stamp internet searches both conducted searches and sites visited both wired and wireless phone calls incoming and outgoing as well as location and duration financial records credit card activity wire transfers bank account information and tracking information from the tsa are being swept up by the nsa and monitored for suspicious patterns _meta_end_dot_

 all of this is ok says the deputy director of national intelligence because of my space _meta_end_dot_

 that s right _meta_end_dot_

 because people socialize on the internet they ve given up any expectation of having their privacy rights protected or respected _meta_end_dot_

 once again congress and the law has been completely circumvented by administration _meta_end_dot_

 congress expressly killed the tia and administration just moved it to the nsa where it could keep it secret _meta_end_dot_

 oh and spend at least _meta_dollor_ref_ billion on it appropriated by a clueless congress _meta_end_dot_

 with these revelations and those of babak pasdar who blew the whistle on a major wireless carrier allowed a third party traced to quantico unfettered access to all of the communications in its network it s time for congress to call a halt to moving forward on the fisa legislation _meta_end_dot_

 that this congress would give the bush administration anything it wants in terms of intelligence is a travesty _meta_end_dot_

 it s time to stop negotiations on fisa and to demand new hearings on these revelations _meta_end_dot_
