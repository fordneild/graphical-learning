  after a long drought on indiana polls surveyusa weighed in earlier this week showing clinton up by _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 today we get new numbers from research _meta_number_ref_ and arg _meta_end_dot_

 research _meta_number_ref_ for wsbt the tribune wish and wane _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ likely voters _meta_end_dot_

 moe _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 the moe is too high to break it down very far but the crosstabs show no surprises clinton leads among women obama a bit more narrowly among men clinton leads among white voters obama by a large margin among black voters _meta_end_dot_

 arg which is a crap pollster has clinton up _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 don t place any bets based on arg polling but they do show the same margin that susa showed just a couple days ago _meta_end_dot_

 indiana is shaping up as a truly competitive state _meta_end_dot_

 clinton has a consistent lead across polls right now but obama has overcome larger early leads on the way to significant wins _meta_end_dot_

 hopefully we ll keep getting new numbers especially from these pollsters so we can get some meaningful trend lines _meta_end_dot_
