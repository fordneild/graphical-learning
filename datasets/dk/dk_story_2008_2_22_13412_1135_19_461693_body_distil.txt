  hillary clinton s campaign was always a swing state _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ percent affair _meta_end_dot_

 she d win in november but by once again ignoring most of the country in favor of an elite few purple states _meta_end_dot_

 watching obama build his incredible ground operation across the country i can t help but hope that this newly built infrastructure stays in place through november _meta_end_dot_

 we must build long term in every state toward a solid future progressive majority _meta_end_dot_

 we can help downticket races even in states where our presidential nominee won t likely win _meta_end_dot_

 and we need to run up the popular vote _meta_end_dot_

 on that last count lbj was the last democrat to win his election by more than _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ percent of the vote _meta_end_dot_

 bill clinton never even broke _meta_number_ref_ percent _meta_end_dot_

 so it s hard to argue you re a national party when we ve been unable to notch a solid national presidential victory in _meta_number_ref_ years _meta_end_dot_

 so i want a presidential candidate who won t just fight for every electoral vote in the swing states and who won t just create new swing states like virginia colorado montana and can we dream _meta_end_question_

 texas _meta_end_dot_

 i want a presidential candidate who will eat into gop popular vote advantages everywhere even in states like idaho and alabama helping cut into the gop s vote tally _meta_end_dot_

 we must mobilize democrats everywhere in every state in our nation to deliver the most dominant democratic margin of victory in half a century _meta_end_dot_

 the media thought bush s _meta_number_ref_ percent victory in _meta_number_ref_ was a mandate _meta_end_dot_

 let s mobilize democrats from show them what a real mandate looks like _meta_end_dot_

 let s aim for a double digit _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ popular vote victory or better with increased democratic majorities in the house and senate _meta_end_dot_

 it won t be a panacea for all that ails us _meta_end_dot_

 we ll still have to work to get better democrats as well as more of them _meta_end_dot_

 but we ll be well on the way towards the progressive america we ve been fighting for all these years _meta_end_dot_
