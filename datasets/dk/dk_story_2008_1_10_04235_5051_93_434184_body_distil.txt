  lost in all the excitement of new hampshire the news that larry craig is still trying to withdraw that pesky guilty broke tuesday subscription to little attention _meta_end_dot_

 craig s lawyers have filed with the minnesota court of appeals asking that it overturn a lower court s refusal to let him have a mulligan _meta_end_dot_

 meanwhile back in idaho craig s self appointed gop would be successor jim risch is back to the scare mongering _meta_end_dot_

 last month he sent a breathless fundraising letter warning idahoans that the national media and the new yorkers and hollywoodites were going to take over the gem state if they didn t send him money _meta_end_dot_

 this month s letter is another treasure trove of paranoia _meta_end_dot_

 it not only evokes the same sense as a publisher s clearinghouse pitch from the early _meta_number_ref_s sans copyediting it promises even more fear _meta_end_exclamation_

 liberal democrats are plotting to steal this u s _meta_end_dot_

 senate seat who knew that senate seats revert to private property in idaho _meta_end_question_

 it only gets better from there as mountaingoat reports the letter includes an appeal from idaho s gop governor but what it doesn t include is the fact that risch is using larry craig to speak at his fundraisers _meta_end_dot_

 see the lobbyists and corporate interests care little about larry craig s um extracurricular activities but care a hell of a lot about getting another toady for their interests in the seat _meta_end_dot_

 while this dashes my fondest hope that craig s stubbornness would lead him to decide to try to keep his seat just to show them all it doesn t mean craig can t create some mischief back in idaho for risch _meta_end_dot_

 see while he might be happy using craig s clout to raise money in dc larry craig s name doesn t come up a lot in risch s campaign back home in idaho where craig s popularity has most definitely waned _meta_end_dot_

 beyond this there s the tidbit that risch s paranoia might just reflect some real fear _meta_end_dot_

 the dems are going to be awash in money this year and they re even looking toward idaho _meta_end_dot_

 while the dscc hasn t committed yet to dem larry larocco the dccc has already said that they ll be targetting idaho s first district and its trainwreck of a congressman republican bill sali _meta_end_dot_

 considering id _meta_number_ref_ is half the state that will only help larocco not to mention whichever dem ends up on the ticket for id _meta_number_ref_ larry grant walt minnick or rand lewis _meta_end_dot_

 so i guess all i can say is watch your back risch the liberals are comin for you _meta_end_dot_
