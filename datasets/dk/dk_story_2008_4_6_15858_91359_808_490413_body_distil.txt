  a few years ago i listened to an npr special on the speeches of martin luther king jr _meta_end_dot_

 as i listened to clips from numerous speeches given over many years i was struck by how often he challenged the listeners _meta_end_dot_

 he used difficult words _meta_end_dot_

 he used extended and complex arguments _meta_end_dot_

 literary allusions _meta_end_dot_

 references to plato and shakespeare _meta_end_dot_

 and he spoke of difficult matters without pretending the changes he sought would be easy or without conflict _meta_end_dot_

 reverend king gave his last speech _meta_number_ref_ years ago this past thursday night _meta_number_ref_ years ago this past friday he was assassinated in memphis _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ is a very symbolic number and it recurs throughout the bible _meta_end_dot_

 rain deluged the earth for _meta_number_ref_ days and _meta_number_ref_ nights _meta_end_dot_

 the city of nineveh repented for _meta_number_ref_ days and god spared it his wrath _meta_end_dot_

 moses waited on mount sinai for _meta_number_ref_ days and _meta_number_ref_ nights and when he came down from the mountain he brought with him the tablets _meta_end_dot_

 jesus fasted in the desert for _meta_number_ref_ days and _meta_number_ref_ nights _meta_end_dot_

 and of course the israelites led by moses wandered in the wilderness for _meta_number_ref_ years _meta_end_dot_

 at the end of his life aware that god would not allow him to lead the israelites in to the promised land moses named joshua his successor climbed to the top of a mountain and peered over gazed upon the promised land and died _meta_end_dot_

 in that final speech king invoked moses and the promised land which for christians can also symbolize heaven i thought of king s speeches the other night when i read this by the new yorker s george packer about barack obama s philadelphia speech in his most famous speech given in washington dc in _meta_number_ref_ king spoke of the danger of bitterness and the necessity of solidarity in his speech in philadelphia barack obama used one of king s metaphors when he spoke of continuing the march king envisioned a story of american reconciliation in which the wounds of racism healed _meta_number_ref_ years after king told the crowd in memphis he had glimpsed the promised land we have a black man on the verge of becoming our nominee for president of the united states _meta_end_dot_

 the progress we ve made as a nation is inspiring but our task isn t finished _meta_end_dot_

 and as obama discussed the nature of our racial problems is complex and that complexity is embodied in barack obama himself obama could have discussed his multi racial multi cultural heritage and self identity as some wonderful conclusion as something to trumpet something that will eventually knock down the walls of hatred and racial division _meta_end_dot_

 one could cite obama s candidacy as proof that americans had transcended race that _meta_number_ref_ years after the death of reverend king senator obama like joshua with the israelites is leading african americans in to their promised land where all americans are equal white and blacks sit at the table of brotherhood where a fetid state where blacks lived under the sweltering heat of injustice and oppression has been transformed in to a state that cast its primary votes for obama and where to quote reverend king every valley shall be exalted and every hill and mountain shall be made low the rough places will be made plain and the crooked places will be made straight and the glory of the lord shall be revealed and all flesh shall see it together instead obama discussed the complexities embodied in our racial and national memories complexities that are in fact embodied in himself in the _meta_number_ref_ years since the assassination of martin luther king the right has pushed the idea that liberals aren t truly patriotic _meta_end_dot_

 the right s idea of america is backward looking _meta_end_dot_

 as obama explained many of jeremiah wright s generation and many who ve come later wrongly believe that america is static that america has made little or no progress toward overcoming our most serious faults _meta_end_dot_

 obama s speech was extraordinary for his candor in discussing why fully overcoming our imperfections is hampered by the apprehensions of white americans anxious about change and why our tragic history obscures the vision of so many african americans bitter about america s imperfections and who are incapable of fully recognizing how profoundly we ve changed _meta_end_dot_

 we all know deeply flawed and imperfect people whom we nevertheless love passionately and with deep commitment _meta_end_dot_

 just as we all love imperfect people we also love our imperfect country _meta_end_dot_

 the other great feature of obama s speech indeed of his candidacy is the emphasis on progress and on hope _meta_end_dot_

 on his website the speech is titled a more perfect union _meta_end_dot_

 the idea the challenge of perfecting recurs throughout the speech _meta_end_dot_

 he opened with the first words of the us constitution we the people in order to form a more perfect union the recent racial tensions of the campaign reflect the complexities of race in this country that we ve never really worked through a part of our union that we have yet to perfect there is no single promised land awaiting our nation _meta_end_dot_

 as liberals and progressives we inherently believe that there will always be work to be done that the job of perfecting is unending that we must never be content that there will always be struggles to overcome as we seek entry in to the next promised land _meta_end_dot_

 obama s speech is one of the rare times when a politician discussed a volatile and highly emotional issues acknowledged difficulties explained complexities and inspired americans to strive to overcome to improve to do what is necessary to create a more perfect union to continue to climb to the mountain top to look over in to the promised land and to keep on striving for the next promised land without fear _meta_end_dot_
