  miami democrat joe garcia candidate for the u s _meta_end_dot_

 house in florida s _meta_number_ref_th district and a recent addition to blue majority seems to be doing quite well so far _meta_end_dot_

 he s doing all the things good candidates do like raising money and cultivating relationships with powerful incumbent representatives whose assistance he may need once he arrives in washington _meta_end_dot_

 well leave it to the _meta_number_ref_th district s incumbent hack mario diaz balart to turn these things into negatives _meta_end_dot_

 garcia has scheduled a fundraiser in new york city for april _meta_number_ref_ at which representative charles rangel chairman of the house ways and means committee will appear _meta_end_dot_

 that s innocent enough i should think _meta_end_dot_

 but mario diaz balart desperate to score political points by any means necessary apparently feels that associating with rangel a longtime critic of u s _meta_end_dot_

 policy toward cuba is some kind of unpardonable offense gotta love that last bon mot which i suppose is what passes for republican creativity these days _meta_end_dot_

 lost in diaz balart s fury of course is the fact that garcia actually disagrees with rangel on cuba _meta_end_dot_

 but who needs facts _meta_end_question_

 hmm bringing jobs into the district and putting money into the local economy aren t those the kind of things a good representative is supposed to do _meta_end_question_

 how come super mario can t overcome his disagreements with charlie rangel to try and do the same thing _meta_end_question_

 one has to ask how exactly does angrily flailing away at the house ways and means chairman help diaz balart in his capacity as a representative _meta_end_question_

 is he tacitly admitting his own inability to work with the leaders of the democratic majority to try and do some good for his constituents _meta_end_question_

 i mean i would think that cultivating some kind of relationship across party lines with the ways and means chair or at least not alienating him by calling him nasty names might be mildly useful in steering federal money and projects towards the _meta_number_ref_th district right _meta_end_question_

 there s always the chance of course that diaz balart doesn t actually care about his constituents and is merely concerned with scoring political points in order to hang on to his precious congressional seat _meta_end_dot_

 but come on he wouldn t be that transparently cynical would he _meta_end_question_
