  barack obama has regularly outperformed the public polls in primary states usually doing about _meta_number_ref_ points better than what he polled _meta_end_dot_

 by contrast hillary clinton has generally performed about the same as what she polled _meta_end_dot_

 in a few states however she has performed significantly better than she had polled _meta_end_dot_

 as discussed earlier she has benefited from the independent expenditure campaigns of three organizations afscme the american federation of teachers and emily s list that have run what appear to be effective campaigns of targeting persuading and mobilizing women voters _meta_end_dot_

 in the states where they have been active including new hampshire california and new jersey she has posted some of her biggest wins and best performances compared to the public polling _meta_end_dot_

 afscme and emily s list are conducting a vigorous direct mail campaign on behalf of clinton in ohio _meta_end_dot_

 with the exception of a few scattered expenditures by a group called powerpac obama has not benefited from any concerted independent expenditure campaign _meta_end_dot_

 until now that is _meta_end_dot_

 in the last few weeks since their endorsement of his candidacy the service employees international union and to a lesser extent the united food and commercial workers union have thrown unmatched resources in to the campaign to help obama defeat clinton in ohio and texas and therefore effectively lock up the presidential nomination _meta_end_dot_

 through the wisconsin primary the three groups backing clinton spent about _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ million _meta_end_dot_

 in ohio they have continued the model of what worked well in the early states lots of direct mail probably directed at women followed up with phone calls _meta_end_dot_

 in ohio they have boosted their program _meta_end_dot_

 whereas in most states they appear to have sent about _meta_number_ref_ pieces of mail it appears that in ohio their target audience has received up to _meta_number_ref_ pieces _meta_end_dot_

 they have also run a small amount of media and are now following up the mail with phone calls _meta_end_dot_

 the total expenditures come to about _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 fec reports indicate that seiu will probably spend over _meta_number_ref_ times as much as afscme and emily s list in ohio _meta_end_dot_

 they ve spent _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ in mail almost matching afscme and emily s list _meta_end_dot_

 in addition to the mail they have also spent _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ on phones _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ on a paid canvass program and _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ million on electronic media _meta_end_dot_

 all together with staff production and other expenses factored in seiu has spent over _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ million in ohio _meta_end_dot_

 obama will benefit from other expenditures _meta_end_dot_

 while emily s list has spent _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ in media in texas such a small expenditure suggests it s probably spanish language radio or possibly cable ads on networks that focus on women like lifetime seiu has dropped over _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ million in to that state _meta_end_dot_

 they have spent _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ on media almost _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ on a canvass program _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ on phones and almost _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ on mail _meta_end_dot_

 the amount seiu has spent just in ohio and texas now equals the combined spending of afscme the aft and emily s list from the start of the campaign through the wisconsin primary _meta_end_dot_

 obama will receive other benefits from the recent endorsements by seiu the ufcw and the teamsters _meta_end_dot_

 afscme and the aft have been contacting their members urging them to vote for clinton which because it s internal union communications doesn t have to be reported to the fec and can be done with dues money _meta_end_dot_

 presumably all three unions that have endorsed obama will be doing the same _meta_end_dot_

 especially in heavily unionized ohio that will be significant _meta_end_dot_

 furthermore ufcw is running their own television ads in support of obama spending approximately _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ so far _meta_end_dot_

 independent expenditures like these can be decisive in extremely close contests _meta_end_dot_

 as discussed earlier afscme the aft and emily s list may have provided hillary clinton her winning margin in nh and contributed to her needed super tuesday wins in ca and nj _meta_end_dot_

 if ohio is close and the polls suggest it is seiu s massive program may offset the effectiveness of afscme and emily s list s precision targeting and put obama over the top _meta_end_dot_
