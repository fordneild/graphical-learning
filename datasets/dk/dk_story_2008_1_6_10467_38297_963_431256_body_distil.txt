  this is not so much about obama at least not directly _meta_end_dot_

 like our other candidates it s hard not to like the guy _meta_end_dot_

 there s a compelling narrative and a fresh face and when he s on he can speechify with the best of them _meta_end_dot_

 but i m not enamored of him _meta_end_dot_

 i like my democrats a bit more hard edged at least at this moment in time _meta_end_dot_

 i never got over the stolen election of _meta_number_ref_ and i don t think i ever will _meta_end_dot_

 i was hoping for someone as a candidate who conveyed that they understood why that matters _meta_end_dot_

 it s about understanding that the other side is screwing you and the rule of law and therefore the country as a matter of policy _meta_end_dot_

 people understood that about nixon and they need to understand it about bush especially the press and the current crop of republicans and conservatives that enable him _meta_end_dot_

 bush is their legacy just as much as iraq and katrina are bush s _meta_end_dot_

 but i do have an observation about the obama campaign _meta_end_dot_

 i love it _meta_end_dot_

 i like the idea of inclusion of forward looking solutions and the day when the former bush administration can be looked back on with the perspective it deserves _meta_end_dot_

 and i love absolutely love the _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ turnout in iowa and the _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ turnout currently projected for indies from nh voting in the dem primary over the republican one _meta_end_dot_

 win or lose obama is running the kind of campaign that will be transformative _meta_end_dot_

 what does that mean _meta_end_question_

 it means finding the holy grail of politics getting new people out to vote while keeping your base intact _meta_end_dot_

 position papers won t do it _meta_end_dot_

 the only way to do that is to feel it in your gut _meta_end_dot_

 we ve seen from the polls that independents are tending d this time around _meta_end_dot_

 they care more about dem issues and reflect the same anxieties about the economy and health care as well as agree that we need to get out of the mistake known as iraq surge or no surge _meta_end_dot_

 and we know only too well in a way the press does not acknowledge that the _meta_percent_ref_ republican base is far from a majority in this country _meta_end_dot_

 in fact we know from these numbers that conservatism as a philosophy and the republicans as a party have failed _meta_end_dot_

 this came about because of the failure in the wh known as george w bush the most consistently unpopular president in post wwii polling history _meta_end_dot_

 the country doesn t want lock step politicians that support that guy _meta_end_dot_

 the voters are just holding their breath waiting for him to go away and not a day too soon _meta_end_dot_

 alas that alone doesn t win elections _meta_end_dot_

 in order to win you have to offer a vision of hope and a sense that the candidate can get us to a better place _meta_end_dot_

 the obama campaign is doing that in a big way _meta_end_dot_

 you can feel it when you see the new faces and talk to the new voters _meta_end_dot_

 you can get a sense when you hear about the big crowds though the key there was seen in iowa the new folks showed up _meta_end_dot_

 there s nothing that excites me more than this iowa dem caucus except maybe this i have to go back to gene mccarthy and rfk in _meta_number_ref_ to remember when political campaigns were movements about things much bigger than themselves _meta_end_dot_

 and while obama hasn t distinguished himself in a way to compare him to rfk yet the campaign potential is there to appeal to a larger audience about something much bigger than himself _meta_end_dot_

 here s just one example of others seeing what i m seeing maybe he ll need more specifics and maybe he won t _meta_end_dot_

 maybe he s playing it right the gop debaters stumbled when they tried to swing at him _meta_end_dot_

 maybe he needs the right vp to finish the job _meta_end_dot_

 we ll see _meta_end_dot_

 and speaking of the debate do other campaigns have it in them to do it _meta_end_question_

 show me the voters showing up and i will write nice things about their campaigns too _meta_end_dot_

 but in the meantime the gop has people who alienate latinos and minorities and treat _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ as a vehicle for personal gain _meta_end_dot_

 we have campaigns that bring out new people to vote _meta_end_dot_

 i think i d rather be on our team than their team _meta_end_dot_

 and i think we re about to see that america would too _meta_end_dot_
