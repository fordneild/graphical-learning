  tomorrow march _meta_number_ref_ around the planet millions of people will shut non essential electrical power off for one hour _meta_number_ref_ p m _meta_end_dot_

 to _meta_number_ref_ p m local time _meta_end_dot_

 the earth hour originated with the world wildlife fund _meta_end_dot_

 the event started last year in sydney australia and boasted more than _meta_number_ref_ million participants who cut the city s overall electrical usage during that hour by as much as _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 as of yesterday nearly _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ businesses worldwide had signed up to participate in this year s event _meta_end_dot_

 some _meta_number_ref_ cities throughout north america have joined _meta_end_dot_

 earth hour has been pooh poohed by some as a lame symbolic act in the face of a gargantuan problem _meta_end_dot_

 but often much of the criticism about a baby step like this one comes from people who sit on their butts rather take the big steps they say are needed _meta_end_dot_

 the biggest step of course is weaning ourselves off the fossil fuel teat something most individuals can only have a modest impact on in their own lives _meta_end_dot_

 but all of us can collectively pressure our governments city county state federal to take bold action _meta_end_dot_

 since ronald reagan gutted the best parts of jimmy carter s energy plan in _meta_number_ref_ not more than a handful of federal officials or candidates for high office have been willing even to discuss seriously the initiatives so desperately needed _meta_end_dot_

 indeed quite a number have engaged in three decades of foot dragging and spouting bogus science _meta_end_dot_

 but we re starting to see some attitudinal changes among previously recalcitrant politicians _meta_end_dot_

 symbolism obviously has its limits but events like earth hour can have a positive impact _meta_end_dot_

 we too often underrate the benefits and spin offs of such political theater _meta_end_dot_

 so tomorrow please join me and millions of others who will be switching off our power at _meta_number_ref_ p m _meta_end_dot_

 days since mission accomplished _meta_number_ref_ the overnight news digest is posted _meta_end_dot_
