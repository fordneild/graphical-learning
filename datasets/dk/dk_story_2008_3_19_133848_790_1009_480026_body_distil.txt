  i noted over the weekend that the wright controversy had taken a chunk out of obama s national numbers in rasmussen s tracking poll _meta_end_dot_

 early indicators are that the speech may be sending him back up _meta_end_dot_

 this is a four day rolling average so each day gives us a _meta_percent_ref_ fresh sample _meta_end_dot_

 you can see that in the drop of obama s numbers after the wright controversy hit the scene _meta_end_dot_

 it was first reported on last thursday _meta_number_ref_th got wide airing on friday _meta_number_ref_th then four days later on the _meta_number_ref_th it hit its lowest point of the week _meta_end_dot_

 that means that only about a quarter of this sample size is post speech _meta_end_dot_

 we ll have a much better picture of its impact in the next _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ days _meta_end_dot_

 also kind of funny that obama got a bigger boost out of winning wyoming and mississippi than clinton did out of winning texas and ohio _meta_end_dot_

 though i m being facetious _meta_end_dot_

 in reality clinton s bump in the poll was more an artificial response to her victories march _meta_number_ref_ than a substantive shift in support so she was bound to come back down to earth anyway with or without her subsequent defeats _meta_end_dot_

 update gallup shows the exact opposite happening with clinton holding a _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ lead over obama _meta_end_dot_

 gallup uses a three day rolling sample _meta_end_dot_
