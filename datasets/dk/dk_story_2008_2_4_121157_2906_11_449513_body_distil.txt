  from pollster com you can see the numbers headed in obama s direction with the blacker dots representing more recent polls the lighter ones older polls _meta_end_dot_

 with bill clinton neutralized and all the big free media breaks falling into obama s lap like the yes we can viral video and the surprise maria shriver endorsement hillary s best hope at this point appears to ride out the clock _meta_end_dot_

 for obama his task for tuesday is simply to survive _meta_end_dot_

 he needs to finish within _meta_number_ref_ delegates of clinton to keep it close because the rest of the month is tailor made for obama louisiana primary and nebraska and washington caucuses on saturday february _meta_number_ref_th maine caucuses on sunday february _meta_number_ref_ the beltway primary on february _meta_number_ref_ dc maryland and virginia and hawaii and wisconsin the next tuesday february _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 of those states only maine might prove kind to hillary though we haven t had any polling since october of last year when hillary had a commanding _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ lead _meta_end_dot_

 the rest _meta_number_ref_ delegates worth of contests will favor obama heavily _meta_end_dot_

 so hillary s task is to defeat obama decisively on tuesday _meta_end_dot_

 if she can t manage that then her plan b is to survive february to fight in march _meta_end_dot_

 on tuesday the _meta_number_ref_th ohio rhode island texas and vermont go to the polls _meta_end_dot_

 vermont appears the most competitive right now though that will change with a couple of weeks to campaign in these states _meta_end_dot_

 winning ohio in particular will be important for propaganda purposes _meta_end_dot_

 tiny wyoming will go on saturday march _meta_number_ref_ with its _meta_number_ref_ delegates perhaps actually mattering _meta_end_dot_

 mississippi with its _meta_number_ref_ delegates should be obama territory on the _meta_number_ref_th _meta_end_dot_

 then _meta_end_dot_

 absolutely nothing for six weeks until pennsylvania on april _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 shit _meta_end_dot_

 atrios and booman may actually have a say this primary _meta_end_dot_

 how scary is that _meta_end_question_

 and those _meta_number_ref_ delegates will loom large _meta_end_dot_

 in fact this is the only contest of significance not including guam for an entire two months _meta_end_dot_

 it ll be huge _meta_end_dot_

 after that another two weeks pass until tuesday may _meta_number_ref_ when _meta_number_ref_ delegates are at stake in indiana and north carolina _meta_end_dot_

 a week later _meta_number_ref_ delegates will be decided in west virginia a week after that on the _meta_number_ref_th kentucky and oregon and that closes out may _meta_end_dot_

 given the demographics of nc heavily african american lots of creative class thanks to the research triangle that ll be obama territory _meta_end_dot_

 oregon democrats are heavily creative class so lean that one toward obama _meta_end_dot_

 beats me about west virginia and kentucky though west virginia was competitive for obama the last time it was polled in april of _meta_number_ref_ back when he wasn t competitive anywhere he trailed _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ with edwards getting _meta_number_ref_ so that bodes well _meta_end_dot_

 meanwhile kentucky has never been polled for the presidential contest so who knows _meta_end_dot_

 so what s left _meta_end_question_

 two weeks later on june _meta_number_ref_ montana and south dakota select _meta_number_ref_ total delegates and then that saturday puerto rico closes things out with its _meta_number_ref_ delegates up for grabs _meta_end_dot_

 so how will this shake out _meta_end_question_

 beats me _meta_end_dot_

 but task one is for obama to survive this tuesday _meta_end_dot_

 if he does task two is for hillary to survive this month _meta_end_dot_

 if she does then they both have to survive the mini super tuesday on march _meta_number_ref_th _meta_end_dot_

 if they do this thing goes to pennsylvania _meta_end_dot_

 or to north carolina _meta_end_dot_

 or to the convention _meta_end_dot_
