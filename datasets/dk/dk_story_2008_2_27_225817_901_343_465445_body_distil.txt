  who could ever forget the prediction of the broder bounce _meta_end_question_

 well a year has passed and wouldn t you know it _meta_end_question_

 no bounce _meta_end_exclamation_

 so thanks i would have to guess to people like atrios who came up with the new media savvy and totally blog o licious innovation of actually keeping track of and checking on predictions from the punditry who set the agenda for our national discourse we find ordinary citizens well actually keeping track of and checking on predictions to his credit broder doesn t run away from this one _meta_end_dot_

 i say it s to his credit because these days you actually have to take special note of people who don t run away from or try to hide their blunders _meta_end_dot_

 it used to be assumed that you just couldn t deny reality like that so it has never before been particularly creditworthy not to _meta_end_dot_

 but times have changed and so broder teaches us a sort of lesson within a lesson _meta_end_dot_

 the conventional wisdom or cw as that paragon of the cw community newsweek likes to call it has changed with the times _meta_end_dot_

 but not everyone has been able to keep up with it _meta_end_dot_

 what do i mean _meta_end_question_

 well on the one hand this embarrassingly inaccurate prediction is broderism at its worst _meta_end_dot_

 the white house had already declared in that other paragon of the cw community time no less its strategy for the next two years so how much clarity of vision does it really require to see that bush isn t going to be any more flexible _meta_end_question_

 was he flexible when he only became president by squeaking it out in the supreme court in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_question_

 no _meta_end_dot_

 was he flexible with his razor thin re election in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_question_

 absolutely not _meta_end_dot_

 in fact he called it a mandate _meta_end_dot_

 quite in contradiction to the cw _meta_end_dot_

 so he s got a clear history here _meta_end_dot_

 why think he d vary it now _meta_end_question_

 or rather then _meta_end_question_

 there was no reason to believe it _meta_end_dot_

 and yet it was believed by more than just broder _meta_end_dot_

 it was believed by the entire washington establishment _meta_end_dot_

 by official washington _meta_end_dot_

 and truth be told more than a few new media types as well _meta_end_dot_

 such is the power of the cw _meta_end_dot_

 and that s the lesson of what we now with the benefit of hindsight can call broder s ossified thinking _meta_end_dot_

 by all rights bush should have been more flexible _meta_end_dot_

 that s what the cw was _meta_end_dot_

 that s what the cw always is when you get your ass handed to you in an election _meta_end_dot_

 you mellow _meta_end_dot_

 you back off _meta_end_dot_

 you compromise _meta_end_dot_

 you have to _meta_end_dot_

 because the traditional levers of political power are no longer in your hands _meta_end_dot_

 but what if you just _meta_end_dot_

 defy tradition _meta_end_question_

 you d likely leave broder and the rest of the cw community without their polestar _meta_end_dot_

 and then what _meta_end_question_

 in that sense broder and others can be forgiven for thinking that bush would do what all presidents do in the same situation _meta_end_dot_

 after all even here at daily kos there was some resistance to the suggestion that a president who hadn t vetoed a bill in six years would suddenly start vetoing everything in sight _meta_end_dot_

 it wasn t possible _meta_end_dot_

 it would destroy the republican party forever _meta_end_dot_

 we would get our agenda passed because the cw said we could _meta_end_dot_

 and we could not therefore risk discussing impeachment because it would suck up all the oxygen and surely would be responsible for sinking that agenda on the other hand it s exactly that kind of ossified thinking that the bush brain trust depends on to get away with its power grabs _meta_end_dot_

 that is they depend on the likelihood that no one would ever believe they were going to do what they were going to do even if you told them point blank before you did it because it was just too damned crazy to be believed _meta_end_dot_

 and so bush and his cohorts found their opposition and even neutral observers looking on in stunned silence as they rode roughshod over the cw and that little trifle we call the constitution too and did pretty much whatever the hell they wanted to _meta_end_dot_

 in fact the crazier the better meaning the better to achieve the cheney post watergate dream of establishing the precedent that the president gets to do whatever the hell he wants on his say so alone _meta_end_dot_

 there were people who saw it coming and believed it to be sure _meta_end_dot_

 and many of us were among them _meta_end_dot_

 but it s also no less clear than bush s insanity was to us that official washington believed that the cw would eventually prevail as it always had throughout their lifetimes _meta_end_dot_

 only it didn t this time _meta_end_dot_

 so maybe now it s time to ask whether it really ever did _meta_end_dot_

 was the cw on scandalized presidents or presidents who are rebuffed at the polls ever really correct _meta_end_question_

 after watergate _meta_end_question_

 did the cw really prevail _meta_end_question_

 when the stories that comprised the watergate scandals first began to break official washington was in stunned disbelief _meta_end_dot_

 moving the congress to the brink of impeachment took months upon months of a slow drip drip drip of revelations _meta_end_dot_

 by the the end of the long national nightmare after the resignation after the pardon after the adoption of new laws regulating campaign finance outlawing warrantless wiretapping and limiting presidential war making authority it was surely the cw that nothing like this would or could ever really happen again _meta_end_dot_

 it would be political suicide _meta_end_dot_

 right _meta_end_question_

 then came iran contra _meta_end_dot_

 and again stunned disbelief _meta_end_dot_

 calls for investigation _meta_end_dot_

 then actual investigation _meta_end_dot_

 actual revelations _meta_end_dot_

 actual convictions _meta_end_exclamation_

 but then _meta_end_dot_

 nothing _meta_end_dot_

 pardons _meta_end_dot_

 reversals on technicalities _meta_end_dot_

 and finally the election of a healer president with a new agenda and a willingness to put it all behind us _meta_end_dot_

 because surely this was just too crazy ever to happen again _meta_end_dot_

 americans just wouldn t stand for it _meta_end_exclamation_

 and yet here we are _meta_end_dot_

 not just in the same situation but at the mercy of the very same people who did it the first two times _meta_end_exclamation_

 the congress certainly at the heart of official washington is only just now waking up to the realities of where the bush cheney revival of what arthur schlesinger famously termed the imperial presidency they ve seen their agenda thwarted by reckless vetoes that fly in the face of the cw signing statements they can t get a legal handle on and the refusal to honor congressional subpoenas an offense for which the house judiciary committee voted to impeach nixon by the way _meta_end_dot_

 and they ve responded after a fashion with the first contempt of congress votes in _meta_number_ref_ years since surprise _meta_end_exclamation_

 the regan iran contra administration and have had to resort to the use of pro forma sessions to prevent recess appointments pocket vetoes and even calls for extraordinary special congressional sessions _meta_end_dot_

 now it s dawning on them that the president s intransigence will likely prevent anything of substance at all from being done for the rest of the _meta_number_ref_th congress _meta_end_dot_

 so what can we expect from the _meta_number_ref_th _meta_end_question_

 well if they can t impeach because it ll derail the agenda that s just been declared derailed and they re not entirely willing to take on a full court press on the subpoena power we were told was the most important reason for electing a democratic majority then the least we might ask of them is to not pass something specifically the retroactive amnesty and bulk surveillance authority the bush cheney administration seeks in order to help cover its tracks _meta_end_dot_

 the cw of course is that congress will buckle _meta_end_dot_

 because it always has _meta_end_dot_

 but hasn t broder and broderism been clear enough in demonstrating that it s time for a new cw _meta_end_question_

 if we re going to be reality based it s time to take off the blindfold and find reality _meta_end_dot_
