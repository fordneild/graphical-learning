  in yesterday s mid day open thread i noted the heritage foundation s ridiculous fisa overtime clock with which the nutters were hoping to play the fear card once again only to find out the card s as much expired as the paa _meta_end_dot_

 the joke of it all was that their first attempt at fear mongering didn t work _meta_end_dot_

 it was the countdown to our certain deaths once the paa expired after the paa expired and everybody was killed in their heavily duct taped beds the sweaty palmed folks at heritage swapped the clock the world didn t give a crap about for this version and it quickly became known as the clock the spell checker didn t give a crap about _meta_end_dot_

 but the crack staff at heritage was on the case _meta_end_exclamation_

 they now bring you this yep _meta_end_dot_

 the spelling is correct but the friggin clock doesn t work _meta_end_dot_

 now it s the clock that was so full of shit it was even disgusted with itself and refused to count right _meta_end_dot_

 the paa expired as heritage breathlessly reminded us at midnight saturday _meta_end_dot_

 so it s been _meta_number_ref_ day _meta_number_ref_ hours yadda yadda yadda _meta_end_dot_

 but islamofascists have kidnapped the days column _meta_end_exclamation_

 aiiiieeeee _meta_end_exclamation_

 it is surely but step one in the establishment of the caliphate _meta_end_exclamation_

 all of which suggests _meta_number_ref_ that even the people who work at heritage don t read their own crap and _meta_number_ref_ that the imperative of the paa in reality means so little to the nutters that nobody s even noticed that the damn thing doesn t work _meta_end_dot_

 you d think they d be tripping over themselves to cite the crazy clock every chance they get pointing out how long it s been down to the millisecond since insert your favorite defeat fantasy here _meta_end_dot_

 it s like a clown car filled with an endless stream of goofball ideas over there _meta_end_dot_

 the site should just play circus music when your browser lands on it _meta_end_dot_
