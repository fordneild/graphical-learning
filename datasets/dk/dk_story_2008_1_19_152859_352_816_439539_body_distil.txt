  i m getting my results from cnn now _meta_end_dot_

 update there are some weird data stream issues going on _meta_end_dot_

 before it crashed the nevada democratic party caucus results site had these numbers with _meta_number_ref_ _meta_percent_ref_ reporting so this thing was all tied up at _meta_percent_ref_ reporting then the site went down _meta_end_dot_

 and cnn and anyone else getting what i assume is the ap election feed is stuck still at _meta_number_ref_ percent reporting _meta_end_dot_
