  so check it out obama literally won more delegates in nevada than clinton and the obama campaign is milking it throwing the hillary campaign s own words against it ha ha ha _meta_end_dot_

 as if this thing couldn t get any more absurd _meta_end_dot_

 update since i was obviously not clear enough and many didn t get it the headline was ironic the last sentence was supposed to give it away _meta_end_dot_

 yeah hillary won the state _meta_end_dot_

 but under her earlier rules all that mattered was the delegate count _meta_end_dot_

 so everyone wins _meta_end_dot_

 or no one wins _meta_end_dot_

 or whatever _meta_end_dot_

 like i said absurd _meta_end_dot_

 in practical and political terms hillary wins _meta_end_dot_

 she gets the little checkmark next to her name in the results _meta_end_dot_

 losing the delegate count is inside baseball _meta_end_dot_

 but the delegate thing assuming it holds up and confirmed is worth a psychological boost to obama and his supporters _meta_end_dot_

 update ii the ap has updated its story and is confirming the delegate thing update iii the percentages reported for this race by the way aren t popular vote figures _meta_end_dot_

 truly bizarre _meta_end_dot_

 they re based on the number of state delegates awarded _meta_end_dot_

 so while no one thinks obama will win the popular vote the percentages should be a lot tighter when the actual popular vote numbers are released _meta_end_dot_
