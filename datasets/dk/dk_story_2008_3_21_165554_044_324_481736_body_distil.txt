  the news just keeps getting worse for alaska rep _meta_end_dot_

 don young _meta_end_dot_

 fresh off the news that lieutenant governor sean parnell will be forging a primary challenge against young democrat jake metcalfe has released an internal poll which shows young trailing both metcalfe himself and a generic nameless democratic nominee _meta_end_dot_

 metcalfe s internal polling jibes with the polling of the other democratic candidates ethan berkowitz and diane benson young trails all three democratic candidates _meta_end_dot_

 this has been confirmed by independent polling as well _meta_end_dot_

 i think it s pretty safe to say that young is in deep deep trouble these numbers are absolutely abysmal for an _meta_number_ref_ year incumbent in a red state _meta_end_dot_

 the saving grace for the alaska republican party is the candidacy of sean parnell _meta_end_dot_

 if parnell is able to depose the unpopular young as governor sarah palin did in the _meta_number_ref_ primary to former governor frank murkowski parnell might be able to coast to election just by being a republican with a good name particularly with the backing of the wildly popular palin _meta_end_dot_

 but if young stays in the race this is one of the top democratic pickup opportunities in the country _meta_end_dot_
