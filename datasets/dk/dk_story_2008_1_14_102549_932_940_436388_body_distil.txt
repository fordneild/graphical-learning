  on sunday bush delivered a shop worn and poorly received speech in abu dhabi _meta_end_dot_

 there was slightly less iran bashing than on the previous day in kuwait although as always with this president s rhetorical outings irony abounded _meta_end_dot_

 apart from these oratorical own goals bush focused on outlining his fatuous vision for freedom and equality in the middle east while showering praise on the u a e _meta_end_dot_

 in a most nauseating way _meta_end_dot_

 for example of a country built upon oil wealth he opined _meta_end_dot_

 even more bizarrely bush described the emirates an oligarchy where government officials are appointed rather than elected as a model society for others to emulate _meta_end_dot_

 well bush s flattering portrait does apply at least to a small minority of the emirates population _meta_end_dot_

 however some _meta_percent_ref_ of residents immigrants who make up nearly the entire workforce in the u a e have few rights no chance to become citizens and virtually no opportunity for improving their lot _meta_end_dot_

 quite the opposite immigrant construction workers who built the opulent hotel bush spoke in are routinely cheated out of wages restricted in their movement and forced to toil in dangerous conditions _meta_end_dot_

 death and injury are common _meta_end_dot_

 domestic workers are treated worse if anything _meta_end_dot_

 the abuse is so pronounced that it sparked rioting in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 meanwhile those who try to defend human rights in the country are harassed by the government _meta_end_dot_

 on top of that many immigrants to the u a e _meta_end_dot_

 are essentially slaves as the u s _meta_end_dot_

 state dept _meta_end_dot_

 reported last june as if all this were not sufficiently repellent the u a e _meta_end_dot_

 for years has trafficked extensively in young children for sex slaves and camel jockeys _meta_end_dot_

 under international scrutiny in _meta_number_ref_ and again in _meta_number_ref_ the u a e _meta_end_dot_

 passed similar legislation setting the minimum age for camel jockeys _meta_end_dot_

 none of these laws were enforced _meta_end_dot_

 in _meta_number_ref_ the emirates finally got around to addressing the core issue by banning human trafficking as such _meta_end_dot_

 aside for monitoring against child jockeys however the government did little to enforce the trafficking law either _meta_end_dot_

 here is the state department s _meta_number_ref_ report this is george bush s model society then one that can t quite decide whether enslaving infants for sport remains desirable one that won t even prosecute slave dealers when at long last it makes a show of outlawing slavery _meta_end_dot_

 there wasn t a word in george bush s speech about any of this _meta_end_dot_

 as with most of the president s public remarks the greater truth is what he leaves out _meta_end_dot_

 while blandly cheerleading for freedom and democracy as he tours the middle east bush studiously ignored that many of his closest allies in the region have appalling records on both scores a fact few news reports mentioned either _meta_end_dot_

 it s supremely ironic then that the gulf news greeted bush s visit to abu dhabi with an open letter denouncing his record of both domestic and foreign policy the u a e _meta_end_dot_

 is a country that lacks basic press freedoms _meta_end_dot_

 it s hard to decide which is more presumptuous the gulf news for touting the emirates respect for human rights and dignity or george bush for offering advice on how to improve life in the middle east _meta_end_dot_
