  this is a post i wish i didn t have to write _meta_end_dot_

 but i think the dccc is going down a very unwise path here and i won t hesitate to call them out on it in short this is not acceptable _meta_end_dot_

 there are no recusals in politics _meta_end_dot_

 rahm emanuel fought tooth and nail against this type of dysfunction where faint hearted democrats refused to campaign against republicans because of local commitments and obligations if you re a member of the democratic caucus your first commitment and obligation is to the caucus not to personal friendships with republicans _meta_end_dot_

 that means you mentor challengers raise money protect vulnerable incumbents and damn well don t go jawing to the press about how much you love this or that republican or talking down our candidates chances _meta_end_dot_

 honestly i m a bit sickened to see the dccc accept this kind of behavior _meta_end_dot_

 rahm was furious and rightly so at alcee hastings for sandbagging ron klein _meta_end_dot_

 but you know which florida incumbent said screw it to this ridiculous tradition and did everything she could to help klein _meta_end_question_

 yep that s right debbie wasserman schultz _meta_end_dot_

 at the time debbie said so she stuck her neck out and helped drag klein across the finish line _meta_end_dot_

 but just because klein managed to win in spite of getting kneecapped by a lazy incumbent in a super safe district d _meta_number_ref_ like alcee hastings is hardly a reason to tolerate this sort of bullshit _meta_end_dot_

 and hastings let s face it is a backbencher only the sixth federal judge in history ever to be impeached by congress whose questionable background precluded him from becoming chair of the intelligence committee last year despite his seniority _meta_end_dot_

 debbie wasserman schultz should want to be held to a higher standard _meta_end_dot_

 she s a rising star in the party and co chair of the red to blue initiative the very program tasked with increasing our majority on the hill _meta_end_dot_

 and i can assure you we aren t just unhappy at debbie s refusal to help raul martinez annette taddeo and joe garcia _meta_end_dot_

 we re pissed that for no reason at all she went to the miami herald and told the paper we re pissed that she s now decided to follow some ridiculous hoary tradition that she had no problem abandoning two years ago _meta_end_dot_

 and we re pissed that she s fomenting discord and damaging morale among local dems too _meta_end_dot_

 and all this coming from an important leader at the dccc _meta_end_dot_

 though don t think we ve forgotten about kendrick meek too we in the netroots have always understood that if you are unwilling to help a fellow democrat that means you are helping a republican _meta_end_dot_

 you can t privilege personal feelings over the good of the party too much depends on it _meta_end_dot_

 rahm emanuel understood this too _meta_end_dot_

 i realize that there is still a great deal of ossified dysfunctionality rusted into the joints of congress _meta_end_dot_

 but the dccc should be fighting against that dysfunction not accepting it _meta_end_dot_
