  a few days ago i laid out a strategy for obama for barack obama to pursue to secure the democratic nomination _meta_end_dot_

 the gist was to keep winning as many or more delegates as hillary clinton like he did this weekend in wyoming which despite the primary loses in tx oh and ri secured him a net tie for the week to downplay pennsylvania west virginia and kentucky because clinton is likely to win all three and not make any huge blunders _meta_end_dot_

 provided he doesn t kill his own candidacy the math is on his side and he s almost certain to be the nominee _meta_end_dot_

 there s been some squawking from clinton supporters that pointing out that the math practically precludes a clinton victory is somehow an illegitimate or dishonest argument _meta_end_dot_

 on the contrary arguing that the math doesn t demonstrate the improbability of a clinton nomination is silly _meta_end_dot_

 as i explained the other day if obama and clinton split the remaining pledged delegates _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ obama would need only _meta_percent_ref_ of the unpledged delegates aka superdelegates who haven t yet committed to a candidate while clinton would need _meta_percent_ref_ of them _meta_end_dot_

 since clinton has added few unpledged delegates since january while obama adds unpledged delegates at a rate of _meta_number_ref_ to _meta_number_ref_ over clinton it s hard to imagine how she gets the nomination except by benefiting from the destruction of barack obama as a viable presidential candidate _meta_end_dot_

 benefiting from an obama collapse will be very difficult for clinton _meta_end_dot_

 she cannot be seen by voters in the remaining primaries and caucuses as being responsible for an obama collapse _meta_end_dot_

 yet it will be hard for it to happen without clinton contributing to it _meta_end_dot_

 therefore the clinton strategy requires steady but not overwhelming attacks on obama _meta_end_dot_

 it requires her to keep the campaign going until he collapses _meta_end_dot_

 and it requires a lot of luck for clinton to benefit from the collapse _meta_end_dot_

 one of the tactics the clinton campaign is fond of is to denigrate or dismiss obama s wins _meta_end_dot_

 with the national press her campaign appears to believe knocking states she lost will help them marginalize obama s candidacy _meta_end_dot_

 states he wins become boutique states or states we won t win in november but because she won it oklahoma is suddenly a state where we must be competitive even though the average democratic vote for president in ok since _meta_number_ref_ has been only _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 while the press may eat up her dismissals of states that have tended to vote republican or are small or have caucuses one has to think it will hurt clinton with the unpledged delegates who have yet to commit to a candidate _meta_end_dot_

 it seems unlikely that many unpledged delegates will reward her dismissals of their states many of which obama has won by giving her their support _meta_end_dot_

 she can appeal to the credentials committee to seat the michigan and florida delegations in proportion to the unauthorized votes those states conducted in january _meta_end_dot_

 because the ratio of obama delegates on the credentials committee will be roughly equal to the ratio of obama delegates entering the convention it s implausible that she would prevail if seating these delegates could swing the nomination away from obama _meta_end_dot_

 if clinton ends the primary season without conceding and pledges to continue on to the convention it won t be because her team honestly thinks they have a chance of winning the nomination against an undamaged obama _meta_end_dot_

 they would be stretching out the race waiting hoping praying that obama will commit an error so grievous so damaging that there is no way he could be our nominee and all the delegates including a significant number of pledged delegates at the convention will realize that he is so damaged that it won t be illegitimate to dump him in favor of another candidate _meta_end_dot_

 the only way i can lose this election former louisiana governor edwin edwards once proclaimed is if i m caught in bed with either a dead girl or a live boy if there were any dead girls or live boys around they weren t tied to edwards he won the election obama would have to experience an unprecedented collapse for clinton to end the primaries with a delegate lead _meta_end_dot_

 and about the only foreseeable way he could suffer that kind of collapse would be to commit a gaffe like george romney s comment about having been brainwashed in vietnam or for revelations to emerge about obama which individually or when accumulated would be the equivalent of edwards dead girl or a live boy clinton can wait and hope without much reason for obama to damage himself _meta_end_dot_

 or she could follow the steps laid out by jonathan chait after the wisconsin primary i wrote that obama had effectively locked up the nomination and the only question would be whether clinton would scorch the earth _meta_end_dot_

 at least to this point she hasn t scorched the earth but the portents aren t good _meta_end_dot_

 clinton appears unsure if she will wage full out political warfare against obama but she s definitely taking shots at obama that he s inhibited from engaging with the same brio with which he s parried shots from mccain _meta_end_dot_

 again chait knowing that he can t fire back at her with the same force he can fire at mccain allows clinton to degrade some of obama s appeal _meta_end_dot_

 but is it good for the party _meta_end_question_

 again chait with obama s lead and with comparatively few delegates left to be contested there are only two conceivable ways that hillary clinton can secure the democratic nomination _meta_end_dot_

 she can destroy obama herself _meta_end_dot_

 or she can poke prod and try to wear down obama and hope he destroys himself _meta_end_dot_
