  this week my hill column tackles fisa _meta_end_dot_

 given what i m hearing from d c it looks like we may have this battle on our hands the middle of next week _meta_end_dot_

 i m told the year long extension will only come into play if _meta_number_ref_ dodd and his allies can clog up the works again or _meta_number_ref_ if they do pass a bill with retroactive immunity but are then unable to agree with house negotiators in conference committee _meta_end_dot_

 reid should just throw the towel in right now and go for the extension _meta_end_dot_

 it s beyond me why he d want to waste time on this and hopefully he doesn t _meta_end_dot_
