  joe klein wrote a column in which he stated the house fisa bill would what was way beyond stupid of course was joe klein himself as glenn greenwald pointed out at the time _meta_end_dot_

 now after telling _meta_number_ref_ million time subscribers that democrats want to coddle terrorists klein does a mealy mouthed correction but just online apparently _meta_end_dot_

 and once again greenwald is there to slap him silly _meta_end_dot_

 first of all there s the not insignificant point that klein reported on legislation that he plainly didn t read _meta_end_dot_

 seems clear enough right _meta_end_question_

 well it would be to anyone who read the legislation but it s clear that klein isn t depending on real reporting _meta_end_dot_

 he s letting republican spin him _meta_end_dot_

 modern journalism time style _meta_end_dot_

 of course klein has a history of dishonest hackery and his editors clearly fearful of the all powerful klein continuously back up that hackery without requiring him to correct his constant errors in the print magazine the better to maintain his pretense of competence _meta_end_dot_
