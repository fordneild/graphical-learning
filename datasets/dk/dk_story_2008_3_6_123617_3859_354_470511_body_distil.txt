  rush limbaugh is at it again this time sinking to another new low _meta_end_dot_

 yesterday he was discussing hillary clinton s comments that they could be headed toward a clinton obama or vice versa ticket _meta_end_dot_

 rush thought that was too good to be true _meta_end_dot_

 talking to his good ol boy network rush had this to say now i d like to note that i haven t been able to find the audio link yet but i did hear it on the view which played the audio and then all the hosts elizabeth hasselbeck included all ripped rush into pieces _meta_end_dot_

 rightfully so _meta_end_dot_

 in my opinion the audio is much worse than the transcript above because of the obviously misogynistic and racist tone followed by a downright evil chuckle before he caps it off with they don t have a prayer maybe rush is back to his drug addicted ways and can t see reality through the oxycontin fog _meta_end_dot_

 the reality is that democrats and independents even some of his own republicans are coming out in force to vote for barack obama and hillary clinton _meta_end_dot_

 and not in a mischievous way as he would have you believe _meta_end_dot_

 no they ve been coming out in force because they are fiercely rejecting the good ol boy network and everything that rush and his cronies stand for _meta_end_dot_

 and it s about damn time _meta_end_dot_

 haven t you had enough _meta_end_question_

 haven t we all had enough _meta_end_question_
