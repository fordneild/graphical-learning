  there s been some great reporting at the wsj on the world e g nick zamiska and on politics jackie calmes comes to mind _meta_end_dot_

 and then there s the editorial page and columnists _meta_end_dot_

 oh sure they have a habit of recruiting ideological soul mates from the dem ranks think gerstein and lieberman but the more interesting pieces are generally from the house wingnuts _meta_end_dot_

 one great example of black is white comes this week from dan henninger writing the wonder land column _meta_end_dot_

 for anyone who actually saw the speeches from obama and mccain back to back with the exciting thousands strong backdrop of diversity for obama and the sclerotic retired congressoldwhitemen for mccain flanking the putative gop nominee this henninger piece must have been pretty startling _meta_end_dot_

 ah mccain represents the politics of hope whereas obama is all about depression and darkness more on depression in a moment _meta_end_dot_

 thank you wsj for straightening me out on that _meta_end_dot_

 i was in danger of believing my lying eyes _meta_end_dot_

 well i shouldn t have been surprised _meta_end_dot_

 after all according to henninger yeah democrats _meta_end_exclamation_

 are you all still hung up on that new deal stuff _meta_end_question_

 what s up with that _meta_end_question_

 in any case contrast that with calmes two days earlier hard to believe it s the same paper covering the same candidates _meta_end_dot_

 tomorrow s piece from the wsj will contrast john mccain and his powerful youth movement with an aging barack obama and his tired message _meta_end_dot_

 has obama been in washington too long _meta_end_question_

 is obama too close to the unpopular george w _meta_end_dot_

 bush and too identified with the war to win in november _meta_end_question_

 the columnists at wsj will explain it all _meta_end_dot_
