  clinton of all the clinton mistakes this cycle and both sides have had plenty of them this is the one that rankles the most _meta_end_dot_

 and really it s been such a stupid and counterproductive narrative that i can t for the life of me fathom why they persist in using it _meta_end_dot_

 like every other state texas will feature more than just the presidential contest _meta_end_dot_

 as texas political expert paul burka writes after analyzing the astonishing early turnout numbers follow the link you won t be disappointed sure but only because we are likely to have a nominee that sees the value in building a _meta_number_ref_ state party rather than clinton s repeated efforts to denigrate and minimize _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_rds of the country _meta_end_dot_

 with a clinton nomination texas doesn t matter because it s not in her electoral calculation _meta_end_dot_

 no one is suggesting obama could win texas but his ground game plus the excitement he s generating across party lines could very well mean the difference between sen _meta_end_dot_

 john cornyn and sen _meta_end_dot_

 rick noriega in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_
