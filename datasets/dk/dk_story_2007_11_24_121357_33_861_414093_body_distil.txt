  susa has a new round of head to heads pitting hillary and barack against the top republicans _meta_end_dot_

 most of the results are fairly predictable with the two democrats generally looking good across the board _meta_end_dot_

 but the kentucky numbers were particularly noteworthy given how it ll be ground zero in the battle to oust the senate minority leader from office _meta_end_dot_

 moe _meta_number_ref_ _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ results two points _meta_number_ref_ kentucky is very much a battleground state _meta_end_dot_

 and if mcconnell is thinking that a hillary presidential nomination helps him out he s sadly mistaken _meta_end_dot_

 the state isn t just trending blue at the state level it also seems to want to move in that direction at the federal level _meta_end_dot_

 and _meta_number_ref_ hillary is clearly not unelectable as her shrillest detractors would have us believe _meta_end_dot_

 in fact go through the battleground states susa polled hillary mostly polls better than obama and obama polls pretty darn good himself everywhere except for ohio where he gets crushed _meta_end_dot_

 sure much of that has to do with name recognition and obama s numbers would improve where he to get the nomination as would romney s whose numbers are generally in the gutter but isn t everyone who knows hillary supposed to hate her _meta_end_question_

 obviously not _meta_end_dot_

 i happen to think that she wouldn t be the best representative of the democratic party of the future but i also don t think she d be a disaster either on substance or electorally _meta_end_dot_

 any arguments that she s a guaranteed general election loser stem from willful ignorance not a reality based look at the facts _meta_end_dot_
