  scott kleeb is back in the national spotlight as cq politics reports on the draft kleeb movement _meta_end_dot_

 now that omaha mayor mike fahey has taken himself out of the running for the senate seat being vacated by chuck hagel kleeb is looking more and more likely _meta_end_dot_

 scott told cq politics that he s seriously considering the run cq goes on to quote mydd s jonathon singer echoing the analysis kos reported on _meta_end_dot_

 conventional wisdom weighs against a win by kleeb but scott is not a conventional candidate and nebraska isn t a conventional red state when it comes to senate races _meta_end_dot_

 scott ran stronger than any democrat has in the _meta_number_ref_rd district in decades last year the most republican part of the state _meta_end_dot_

 and nebraskans have a long tradition of sending democrats to the senate only one republican hagel has won a senate seat since _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 while a rematch with smith in ne _meta_number_ref_ would be the cautious way to go there s no guarantees there _meta_end_dot_

 the district is still prohibitively republican despite the inroads scott made _meta_end_dot_

 now that the club for growth has their man smith ensconced in the seat they ll do everything they can to keep him there and will find very enthusiastic partners in the nrcc which will be defending potentially vulnerable freshman tooth and nail _meta_end_dot_

 scott may find that a statewide race is actually less of an uphill climb _meta_end_dot_

 we ll hopefully have a better sense of that when the polling kos commissioned in the state is done _meta_end_dot_
