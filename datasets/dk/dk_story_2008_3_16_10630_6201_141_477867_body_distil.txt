  from the young island nation of palau nestled in the warm waters of the pacific ocean _meta_number_ref_ miles south of tokyo comes news of a most peculiar fossil find _meta_end_dot_

 it s too soon to say if it s a clever hoax a new species or just unusual variation in an all too familiar critter _meta_end_dot_

 early reports suggest that island dwarfism was hard at work in the relatively recent past _meta_end_dot_

 but hold on to your hat because this time the species downsized by the long sharp scalpel of natural selection may have been us _meta_end_dot_

 via afarensis hominid plasticity human evolution _meta_end_dot_

 for creationists it s the crux of controversy _meta_end_dot_

 and don t think for a second this belief is only present among conservatives _meta_end_dot_

 a _meta_number_ref_ poll shows that almost half of all kerry voters believed that god created humans in their present form but the evidence for human evolution is immense _meta_end_dot_

 well we can assume most creationists are busy this morning and there is a lot of new blood coursing through the veins of big orange _meta_end_dot_

 so in hope of placing this new find in some scientific context a short survey of a few evolutionary highlights and a poll on human origins is in order right here right now on sunday kos _meta_end_dot_
