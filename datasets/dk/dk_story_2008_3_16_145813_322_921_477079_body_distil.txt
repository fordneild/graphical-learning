 rossmiller author of still broken a recruit s inside account of intelligence failures from baghdad to the pentagon and former intelligence analyst for the defense intelligence agency agreed to an interview last week that covered his experience both within the agency and his post dia life _meta_end_dot_

 rossmiller s book was reviewed last week the author contributes regularly at americablog _meta_end_dot_

 what has the reaction to your book been from your former colleagues _meta_end_question_

 i ve been extremely grateful for the support i ve gotten from my former colleagues at a variety of levels _meta_end_dot_

 certainly there are some who are unhappy with the book but i ve gotten a ton of positive feedback from people i worked with as well as many others in the intelligence community who have gotten in touch after reading it _meta_end_dot_

 i think people who have read the book understand that i didn t write it to embarrass anyone personally but rather to give a snapshot of problems that are mostly either structural or political in nature _meta_end_dot_

 are there lessons you learned from the messed up bureaucracy of intelligence that could be applied to progressive organizing and coordination which also at times seems muddled and ineffective _meta_end_question_

 _meta_end_question_

 i don t have very much experience on the organizing side of progressive politics but certainly the more flexible an organization is the better it can adapt and improve to changing circumstances _meta_end_dot_

 as with most large movements and this is cliche but no less true for being so the attitude comes from the top and the impact comes from the bottom _meta_end_dot_

 you need leadership that encourages honest evaluation and a worker bee level that feels like it s part of a greater good _meta_end_dot_

 and finally when ego or pride gets elevated over empiricism i e doing what works instead of what people personally think is best you re bound to go off in the wrong direction _meta_end_dot_

 what skills that made you a good fit for the intelligence community make you a good fit for your pursuits now _meta_end_question_

 you know i joke that i don t really have any marketable skills i stopped being good at math when letters got involved i m no good at science and my computer abilities are embarrassing especially for a blogger that really the only things i m good at are reading writing and problem solving _meta_end_dot_

 but it turns out there s still some things a person can do with those abilities _meta_end_dot_

 analyzing information which is what intelligence is really all about was right up my alley and it was an easy transition to doing the same thing just without the classified info for the national security network which is a fantastic progressive think tank and americablog which of course most dailykos readers know well _meta_end_dot_

 were you aware at the time if other intelligence analysts at other agencies were being hammered for being too pessimistic it s not something that i can confirm first hand so i ll leave it to other analysts to report the extent to which that particular influence existed in other agencies _meta_end_dot_

 certainly news reports have repeatedly indicated that a variety of intelligence agencies have been influenced for political reasons _meta_end_dot_

 since you left the dia have you encountered other analysts or workers at other intelligence agencies that experienced similar problems i e refusal to believe analysts major chain of command confusion _meta_end_question_

 i have but not from people who are willing to go on the record about it _meta_end_dot_

 one of the things i was really cognizant of in writing still broken was that i didn t have enough experience in the intel community to make sweeping judgments so i really tried to limit my judgments to what i did and saw personally _meta_end_dot_

 but hopefully we ll have more people who are willing to examine these kind of problems honestly whether from a top down or ground level perspective _meta_end_dot_

 have the analysis methods you used to study internal iraqi politics used at all by you to look at u s _meta_end_dot_

 domestic politics or are you still focused on international politics and the mideast in particular _meta_end_question_

 my personal interests are still very much geared toward iraq and the middle east which is what i know best _meta_end_dot_

 still i ve been a news junkie ever since i was a kid and the things that made me a good analyst about those issues do carry over when it comes to navigating the domestic political scene which i ve had to do much more in my current jobs _meta_end_dot_

 it probably sounds simplistic but the willingness to ignore conventional wisdom and look at the actual empirical facts and trends is something that manages to elude a lot of people even perhaps especially long time observers of this stuff _meta_end_dot_

 how much of your disillusionment with the dia had to do with your seeing the end use of the product you produced when you saw the interrogations out in the field _meta_end_question_

 and how much had to do with the pure bureaucratic nightmare you faced each day _meta_end_question_

 in other words if one or the other had not existed the bureaucratic crap the depressing use of your material would you have been able to stay on feeling you were doing some good _meta_end_question_

 ultimately it was a combination of the two elements _meta_end_dot_

 the end result of the analysis was often problematic because of the bureaucratic issues and i include the politicization of the process as part of that general genre _meta_end_dot_

 i don t think the problems can exist independently of each other without a total lack of planning for the invasion s aftermath i don t think we have the same troubles with detainees for example _meta_end_dot_

 but in the end the driving force for my departure was the political pressures that i felt got in the way of honest and accurate information getting up the chain of command and of course to the american people _meta_end_dot_

 how many other cogs as you put it in the intelligence agencies would have second thoughts about what they were doing if they saw the largely indiscriminate round up of suspects based on their material that you saw _meta_end_question_

 i honestly can t say _meta_end_dot_

 i think that s something that a lot of people sort of know at least in theory but it certainly changed things for me to be confronted by it up close and personal _meta_end_dot_

 the whole idea of civil service including military is that you have faith in the civilian leadership at the top of the government and you try to have confidence that even in the midst of partisanship that some stuff will get done the right way _meta_end_dot_

 i m sure there are places in the government where that s true and i certainly don t blame my former colleagues for staying as everybody has to do what they think is good and right _meta_end_dot_

 ultimately for me departing was the answer but it definitely wasn t an easy choice _meta_end_dot_
