  this is rich _meta_end_dot_

 another of cheney s optimistic assessments i briefly thought about chronicling his lies for this post but the task proved far too daunting _meta_end_dot_

 someone with more time on their hands can cull the list from the _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ million hits a google search on dick cheney lies finds _meta_end_dot_

 meanwhile on day _meta_number_ref_ since victory was declared in iraq _meta_end_dot_

 no a secure and stable iraq by january _meta_number_ref_ isn t any more a reality than the new narrative that iraq is less of an issue for the american people _meta_end_dot_

 it s just an issue that the traditional media has grown weary of probably because it continues to point up just how gullible and wrong they ve been on the issue for the last five years _meta_end_dot_

 as for the american people i suspect they ve just given up any hope that this government is going to do a damned thing about it _meta_end_dot_
