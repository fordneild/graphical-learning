  mcconnell and reid are on the senate floor trading verbal blows over the most recent obstructionist move by the republicans _meta_end_dot_

 they have tied up what was supposed to have been quick consideration of the economic stimulus package by invoking _meta_number_ref_ more hours of debate using the argument that they got it too late to fully consider it _meta_end_dot_

 they re actually raising hell about low income heating assistance being slipped into the bill _meta_end_dot_

 heartless bastards _meta_end_dot_

 reid is as steamed as i ve ever seen him and is actually sounding like us in talking about the important constitutional issues and executive overreach on fisa _meta_end_dot_

 he s arguing that mcconnell is using this stall tactic to try to run out the clock on the _meta_number_ref_ day extension of fisa thereby trying to get us back to the position we were in last august forcing through a bad bill under strict time constraints _meta_end_dot_

 this means that we are pretty unlikely to see any votes on fisa before thursday _meta_end_dot_

 which means that we could get past super tuesday and perhaps have a full dem caucus in dc when the votes happen _meta_end_dot_

 update dsmilev sums it up perfectly in the comments
