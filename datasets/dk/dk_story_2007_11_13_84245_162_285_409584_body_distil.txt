  from the great state of maine _meta_end_dot_

 thank you karl rove for saving us from ourselves dear mr _meta_end_dot_

 rove thank you for your comments of last friday in which you lamented the crudeness of the daily kos community _meta_end_dot_

 i ve reviewed a transcript of the citizen _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ event and given your credentials and reputation have no reason to doubt your sincerity in this matter _meta_end_dot_

 in the interest of fostering a more civilized blogging experience for writers and lurkers alike daily kos is taking a page from your republican energy policy playbook _meta_end_dot_

 starting today we are enacting voluntary restraints on profanity and other incivilities _meta_end_dot_

 these guidelines were of course formulated in secret with no input from anyone except well we really can t say _meta_end_dot_

 naturally we won t be able to curb our pottymouth emissions overnight _meta_end_dot_

 that s why we ve set up a system of cuss and trade offsets _meta_end_dot_

 if for example a blogger wishes to call you a four eyed pigfucker he or she may do so only after agreeing to include one or more terms of endearment such as sir or my esteemed colleague or my worthy opponent or you get the idea _meta_end_dot_

 practically speaking the required suggested number of offsets will depend on the quantity and intensity of the proposed emissions _meta_end_dot_

 in the above example for instance a kossack might bring his or her vitriol output down to an acceptable level with four offsets as follows you might wish to adopt this system yourself mr _meta_end_dot_

 rove _meta_end_dot_

 for example one of your typical statements as advisor to the president of the united states might be altered slightly to meet our new voluntary standards as follows we trust that this new voluntary code of civility along with the cuss and trade offset program will result in a more pleasant blogging experience here at daily kos _meta_end_dot_

 sincerely bill in portland maine cheers and jeers starts in there s moreville _meta_end_dot_
