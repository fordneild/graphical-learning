  over at swing state project james has a great compilation of recent comments by prominent republicans many retired expressing great pessimism about their party _meta_end_dot_

 the recurring theme is that the republicans are out of touch and don t realize that they re out of touch _meta_end_dot_

 readers of daily kos generally don t need to be told that the current gop especially as represented by the administration of george w _meta_end_dot_

 bush is not conservative but is radical _meta_end_dot_

 while it wouldn t express it in the same terms since _meta_number_ref_ the american public has largely come to the same conclusion _meta_end_dot_

 the electorate hasn t really shifted much ideologically _meta_end_dot_

 the change is that americans now see through the republican sham of hiding their true intentions behind clever catch phrases like compassionate conservatism and appear ready to possibly reluctantly give the democrats a chance to run the white house while maintaining control of congress _meta_end_dot_

 we have a tremendous opportunity next november and beyond because it s not inconceivable that the in _meta_number_ref_ the magnitude of the potential democratic win and its lasting effect lasting effect on american politics could be similar to that of the _meta_number_ref_ election _meta_end_dot_

 the _meta_number_ref_ election built on the big democratic successes of _meta_number_ref_ by bringing in franklin delano roosevelt providing the governing majorities and mandate and willingness for change and implemented the foundations of the new deal like social security labor law and government regulation over the economy that are the basis of our national wealth and power and facilitated the creation of a massive middle class _meta_end_dot_

 we re approaching an election where it s not just democrats or the left side of our national political spectrum that hungers for bold assertive politics and a dramatic change of course _meta_end_dot_

 the views of many of the people associated with the netroots really are the majority because they re not just the left but they re the left and the center _meta_end_dot_

 we are the mainstream _meta_end_dot_

 as i read the boehlert quote i thought of something from the preface of e j _meta_end_dot_

 dionne s excellent book stand up fight back republican toughs democratic wimps and the politics of revenge _meta_end_dot_

 to some that may sound like flaccid broderism _meta_end_dot_

 but dionne aims much of his criticism at exactly those democrats and protectors of the established wisdom who spend much of their time tut tut ing democrats for being too left too liberal too this or that _meta_end_dot_

 he thinks the democrats biggest banes have been internal squabbling which makes democrats look unprincipled and craven in timidly looking for the right positioning which then leads to indecisive timidity _meta_end_dot_

 what democrats should do dionne argues is stake out their positions and defend them proudly and make it clear that our political positions derive from our political principles _meta_end_dot_

 it can t be emphasized enough that we need to be bold in espousing our principles and bold in advancing policies that are linked to our principles principles such as making it clear that government should be for everyone not just a privileged few making billions of dollars _meta_end_dot_

 government should be on the side of those protecting the environment for the future not raping it for instant profits _meta_end_dot_

 government should be on the side of consumers who want safe food and baby toys not corporations or free trade ideologues who want us to cede our ability to act in the public good _meta_end_dot_

 we should emphasize our respect for tradition but also our embrace of tolerance and diversity _meta_end_dot_

 and we should honor our vision of a people not acting as selfish individuals but pursuing individual goals in a broader society bound with a sense of solidarity a sense of shared benefits and shared sacrifice the sense that we re all in this together that michael tomasky evoked last year when he succinctly declared the democrats need to become the party of the common good the principles and beliefs of the left or the netroots or the democratic party have long and effectively been derided by the gop as elitist as fringe as hostile to middle america or mainstream values but it s becoming clear to americans who aren t strong partisans that it s the gop that s out of the mainstream _meta_end_dot_

 it s the gop that s out of touch with mainstream values and that it s actually the democrats who best represent the beliefs aspirations and values of most americans _meta_end_dot_

 democrats seem to have finally started fitfully and with frequent and infuriating reverses and failures of will to embrace the approach that confidently defending our principles will bond the center to us _meta_end_dot_

 and observant republicans are finally figuring this out which is why they re so despondent _meta_end_dot_

 there s the adage success breeds success _meta_end_dot_

 the democratic success started in _meta_number_ref_ with the resolute and confident defense of social security one of democrats greatest accomplishments and something central to our belief in the positive role of government _meta_end_dot_

 the social security battle was the abrupt and crushing end to bush s brief claim to a post election mandate and along with the disasters in new orleans and iraq the most visible demonstrations of the republicans destructive theory and practice of governance _meta_end_dot_

 the success continued on to the _meta_number_ref_ election _meta_end_dot_

 and mixed amid those infuriating failures of will on iraq the _meta_number_ref_th congress has so far seen some major successes such as passing legislation to greatly expand health care to children and veterans raising the minimum wage implementing major congressional ethics reform increasing support for stem cell research slashing interest payments on student loans and banning discrimination against gays and lesbians in the workplace _meta_end_dot_

 of course several of these successes have been blocked by bush and his republican enablers in congress but democrats have at least started even though inconsistently and fitfully to challenge bush and the republicans _meta_end_dot_

 democrats need to continue to stand up to fight back to not shirk from being associated with our principles but to boldly and confidently embrace them _meta_end_dot_

 they still have a long long long way to go before they will inspire the kind of respect and passion we hope one day see _meta_end_dot_

 but some republicans are starting to see the what the democrats are doing and they know that if democrats don t turn back against themselves and if they don t again become timid and too averse to boldness we could recapture the devotion of the american electorate the way we did for much of the middle part of the _meta_number_ref_th century _meta_end_dot_
