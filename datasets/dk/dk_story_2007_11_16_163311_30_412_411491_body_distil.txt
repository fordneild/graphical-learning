  remember how last night s debate closed on a like totally serious note with a question to hillary clinton about whether she preferred diamonds or pearls _meta_end_question_

 can you even believe that some ditzy student would ask such a question _meta_end_question_

 well as it turns out cnn s defense _meta_end_question_

 oh well then that s ok _meta_end_exclamation_

 no problem with a so called news network focusing on the appearance and devotion to consumerism of the first serious female presidential candidate ever _meta_end_dot_

 i m so glad they cleared that up _meta_end_dot_

 otherwise i might have had to question my faith in the awesomeness of cnn _meta_end_dot_
