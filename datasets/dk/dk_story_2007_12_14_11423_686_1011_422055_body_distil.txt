  the senate judiciary committee joined its house counterpart yesterday in voting to send contempt of congress citations to the floor against witnesses who ve refused to comply with congressional subpoenas _meta_end_dot_

 procedurally this puts the senate on the same footing as the house _meta_end_dot_

 the judiciary committee has said the defiance of these subpoenas constitutes contempt _meta_end_dot_

 in both the house and the senate the full bodies must vote to approve those citations _meta_end_dot_

 if they do they will be referred to the u s _meta_end_dot_

 attorney for the district of columbia for prosecution _meta_end_dot_

 that s jeffrey taylor appointed under the now defunct clause of the patriot act that permitted disgraced former attorney general alberto gonzales to install him in office without senate approval and later held over in the job by a vote of the d c _meta_end_dot_

 federal district court _meta_end_dot_

 except for this of course so the upshot of yesterday s vote is that the senate is in the same boat as the house which has had its judiciary committee s recommendation in hand for five months now with no floor vote in sight _meta_end_dot_

 and even if that floor vote is taken the white house says it will direct the doj not to prosecute _meta_end_dot_

 how that might effect the outcome of the vote itself is as yet unknown _meta_end_dot_

 it s said that congress wants to proceed methodically first taking the statutory contempt road to see if it finds itself blocked _meta_end_dot_

 of course there will first be the question of whether they can round up the votes for something futile which of course was the aim of the white house s comment _meta_end_dot_

 it seems the game plan is still to try it anyway and then when the citations are blocked by the doj the congress will try to sue it s way out of this fix _meta_end_dot_

 of course there s always inherent contempt which bypasses the courts entirely and which has been getting more and more notice lately _meta_end_dot_

 but with the congress pushing even the statutory contempt vote off repeatedly it s unknown whether there s any serious consideration being given to any bolder moves _meta_end_dot_

 update what that means of course is that you could and should contact your congressional representatives and ask what they know about inherent contempt and tell them why you support it _meta_end_dot_
