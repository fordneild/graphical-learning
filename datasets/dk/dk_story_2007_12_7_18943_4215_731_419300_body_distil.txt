  from multiple sources i m told chavez called udall this afternoon to say he d be dropping out tonight announcement expected at _meta_number_ref_ p m _meta_end_dot_

 et _meta_end_dot_

 good riddance _meta_end_dot_

 except maybe not as democrats are still looking for a top tier challenger for nm _meta_number_ref_ and marty unfortunately qualifies as one of those even if i d beg to differ _meta_end_dot_

 i was looking forward to udall ending chavez career but really we ll still be plenty entertained watching pearce and wilson tear each other up in the gop primary _meta_end_dot_

 update it s official _meta_end_dot_

 i have added chavez statement in the extended text _meta_end_dot_

 note that he made no mention of nm _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 update ii i have confirmed that chavez will not run for congress _meta_end_dot_

 good _meta_end_dot_
