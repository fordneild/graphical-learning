  we ve got the lousiana primary and caucuses in nebraska and washington tonight and a caucus in maine tomorrow _meta_end_dot_

 here s how the obama campaign sees these contests shaping up according to their leaked document on the upcoming contests according to jerome i haven t seen the spreadsheet myself pollster com is down right now so i can t go tally up the latest numbers but there haven t been too many _meta_end_dot_

 a _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ delegate advantage for obama over the weekend would be a stellar result for his campaign _meta_end_dot_

 anyone want to venture predictions _meta_end_question_

 i haven t tallied mine up from super tuesday but they were ugly _meta_end_dot_

 there s no glory to predicting only pain _meta_end_dot_

 for this weekend i ll cop out and stick with the obama campaign s numbers _meta_end_dot_

 they re as good as any _meta_end_dot_

 perhaps a little pessimistic but close enough _meta_end_dot_

 results times today update kansasr kindly tallied my results for me _meta_end_dot_

 hmm not disgustingly bad but not great _meta_end_dot_

 and nm may still be a wrong so i separated that result out since we still don t know who won the state hillary has a _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ vote lead with provisional ballots being counted _meta_end_dot_
