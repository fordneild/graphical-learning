  rep _meta_end_dot_

 debbie wasserman schultz d has been busy kneecapping some of our best challengers this cycle _meta_end_dot_

 amazingly she is part of the dccc leadership she s currently co chair of the red to blue program which is tasked with helping our most promising challengers _meta_end_dot_

 but this isn t the first time we ve seen something like this _meta_end_dot_

 from naftali bendavid s the thumpin p _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ it s pretty stunning to me that anyone who would take on a leadership role in the dccc would be so willing to undermine the cause _meta_end_dot_

 yet where we had adam schiff dragging his feet last cycle we now have debbie wasserman schultz doing the same if not worse this time out _meta_end_dot_

 this job is not for the faint of heart _meta_end_dot_

 rahm emanuel knew that _meta_end_dot_

 as larry sabato said of rahm in the thumpin you need someone whose favorite word is not a or the but fuck in other words we needed a hardass and we got one and we won _meta_end_dot_

 rahm did not tolerate sandbagging whether from adam schiff or alcee hastings or anyone else _meta_end_dot_

 and we need chris van hollen the current dccc chair to have the same zero tolerance policy _meta_end_dot_

 we know that he has a very different approach from rahm but being a hardass isn t about cursing or withering glares or high decibel rants _meta_end_dot_

 it s about not accepting bullshit from people who want to call themselves your fellow democrats whether backbenchers or leaders _meta_end_dot_

 by whatever methods he chooses van hollen needs to make debbie wasserman schultz fall in line _meta_end_dot_

 if we want to expand our majorities this fall we can t have party leaders holding us back _meta_end_dot_

 health insurance stem cell research global warming the war in iraq these are all issues which democrats are champing at the bit to address _meta_end_dot_

 surely chris van hollen can t let debbie s personal friendships with the likes of ileana ros lehtinen stand in the way _meta_end_dot_
