  we get emails this seemed pretty odd to me so i looked at the article wait where is there a first name associated with that _meta_end_question_

 so i went to google and confirmed my suspicion the article was about a pastor from a town named clinton in this case the town of clinton new york _meta_end_dot_

 how many idiotic rumors get started this way _meta_end_question_
