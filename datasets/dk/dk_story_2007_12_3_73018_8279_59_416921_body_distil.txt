  from the great state of maine _meta_end_dot_

 it was a damn good question from an american patriot and hero lost in all the pathetic whining about whether or not general kerr was a plant by the clinton campaign answer no _meta_end_dot_

 the clinton campaign didn t pluck the question out of the _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ submitted _meta_end_dot_

 cnn did _meta_end_dot_

 we would add duh _meta_end_exclamation_

 was the predictable yet still mind numbing response from the republican weebles at last wednesday s televised hate forum _meta_end_dot_

 here s a little clue as to what the correct answer is starting with this _meta_number_ref_ editorial from the navy times the troops have no problem serving with gay soldiers the public supports allowing gays to serve openly in the military by a margin of _meta_percent_ref_ to _meta_percent_ref_ the general at the head of the joint chiefs of staff when dadt was implemented says it s time to throw the policy on the scrap heap _meta_end_dot_

 besides all that drumming gays out of the military is a huge waste of money _meta_end_dot_

 aren t republicans the ones always yammering on about fiscal responsibility _meta_end_question_

 oh silly me they threw that out the window when they thought they d become a permanent majority _meta_end_dot_

 but as usual reality is little more than a gnat circling around the republican candidates empty blockheads apparently hunter believes that embracing the values and principles of neo nazi thugs who have been let into the service because the pentagon is so desperate for warm bodies are a ok in jesusland _meta_end_dot_

 i wonder if his first act as commander in chief will be taking out a recruiting ad in aryan nation digest _meta_end_dot_

 i hear their rates are cheap _meta_end_dot_

 we all know what kind of conduct mike s talking about _meta_end_dot_

 pity the poor helpless heterosexual corporal who drops the soap in the shower _meta_end_dot_

 the gays just can t help themselves _meta_end_dot_

 target acquired launch missile republicans sure do spend a lot of time thinking about naked men lathering up _meta_end_dot_

 this is probably my favorite line of logic from wednesday night ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha_meta_beep_ref_ _meta_end_exclamation_

 that s right out of the dr _meta_end_dot_

 strangelove playbook gentlemen you can t fight in here _meta_end_exclamation_

 this is the war room yes gays can only serve in peacetime _meta_end_dot_

 otherwise they might accidentally fight and even die for freedom while helping keep america safe and secure _meta_end_dot_

 better that they should accidentally slice their throat with a potato peeler at fort dix and die for their unit s chow line in between wars _meta_end_dot_

 finally the maverick translation if gays are allowed to serve openly the united states military will cease to be the best military in history and we ll no longer have the bravest most professional and best prepared fighting force in the world _meta_end_dot_

 that kind of backwoods thinking is a slap in the face to anyone who has worn is wearing or will wear a uniform _meta_end_dot_

 of all the candidates up on that stage mccain a combat veteran who is celebrated for supposedly having the ability to think with some semblance of logic dishonored all of our troops by suggesting that repealing a stupid unpopular money wasting hypocritical policy would make our fighting force more brittle _meta_end_dot_
