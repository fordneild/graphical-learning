  who cares who rudy sleeps with _meta_end_question_

 not me whoever it is this year and maybe not the public _meta_end_dot_

 this story is about governance _meta_end_dot_

 oh and about the national press too i suppose _meta_end_dot_

 so let s start with congratulating ben smith at politico for an investigative reporting job well done _meta_end_dot_

 from e p which recognizes a scoop when they see one is that legit _meta_end_question_

 former mayor ed koch hardly a partisan defender of democrats these days doesn t think it s legit a reader by email points out the cantankerous koch is no fan of rudy s and will support a democrat this year _meta_end_dot_

 so once again the local ny press seems to be on this while the national press avoids taking on an honest view of rudy because he s not the candidate yet or because what nyc hates about rudy the rest of the country likes or some other such rationalization which doesn t hold for hillary or obama or edwards _meta_end_dot_

 but there s a deeper understanding of this susang also covers that in rudy makes the case for democratic party governance _meta_end_dot_

 not only that remember that the president of the united states is a guardian of the constitution _meta_end_dot_

 rudy may play at law and order but does he consider himself above the law when it suits him _meta_end_question_

 we re just barely getting through eight years of another president whose commitment to the rule of law see alberto gonzales was pretty shaky _meta_end_dot_

 now we have rudy patron of the indicted bernard kerik rudy of the taxpayer funded tryst to consider in a job interview for the most powerful position in the world where judgment is key and ethics matter _meta_end_question_

 i don t think this story is going to go away any time soon _meta_end_dot_

 and if the national press had any sense they d start paying more attention to rudy s actual record than they are doing now which outside of ny is not paying attention at all _meta_end_dot_

 that includes rudy s record on _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ including the location of the emergency operations center the radios the nyc firefighters didn t have and the health issues and air quality issues right after _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ and how they were handled _meta_end_dot_

 i don t really care if that might affect the outcome _meta_end_dot_

 that s what a journalist s job is and it s about time they did their job as well as ben smith has _meta_end_dot_
