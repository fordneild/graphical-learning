  last night i joined thousands of my fellow kansans in the kansas democratic caucus process _meta_end_dot_

 traditionally we have held a primary vote but the kansas legislators couldn t find it in the budget this time around and opted for the caucus process instead _meta_end_dot_

 that turned out to be a huge mistake _meta_end_dot_

 thousands of people showed up at my caucus location a small church that could only fit a few hundred _meta_end_dot_

 i waited in traffic forever and ended up parking about _meta_number_ref_ blocks away where i lucked out on a parking spot _meta_end_dot_

 eventually the police would arrive and partially shut down the road due to traffic congestion in a largely residential area _meta_end_dot_

 we got in line which was already _meta_number_ref_ blocks long _meta_end_dot_

 temperatures were falling fast and everyone was sniffling and shivering from the ice cold breeze that steadily pounded us _meta_end_dot_

 at one point i joked that we were like the penguins in march of the penguins huddled together with our backs to the frigid wind _meta_end_dot_

 eventually my group made it into the building _meta_end_dot_

 sweet success _meta_end_exclamation_

 as we entered the building the line was split registered democrats to one side and independents republicans who wanted to switch parties on the other _meta_end_dot_

 we continued to wait patiently and we could see the line outside still snaking along for several blocks _meta_end_dot_

 we heard rumor that they were having to caucus in smaller groups because of the size of the room _meta_end_dot_

 we made some progress in line but then it came to a complete halt for almost an hour _meta_end_dot_

 that is when several of us noticed a huge problem _meta_end_dot_

 all of those independents republicans who were registering on site were being ushered right into the caucus room while those of us with pre existing democratic registrations were made to wait while they caucused _meta_end_dot_

 once this became clear the good folks in line became very upset myself included _meta_end_dot_

 we hadn t moved in an hour _meta_end_dot_

 was there a grand conspiracy to usher in these independent voters _meta_end_question_

 well there were vastly more obama volunteers than actual democratic party folks on site and those indy votes did break for obama but in the end it was straight up cluster_meta_beep_ref_ _meta_end_exclamation_

 no bad intent just part of the chaos and unorganized nature of the event _meta_end_dot_

 obama volunteers were everywhere and doing the best they could but i only saw one identifiable ks democratic party person during this time _meta_end_dot_

 at one point while we waited we noticed a large room that was completely empty _meta_end_dot_

 so we took control opened the doors and asked people to start snaking the line in that room _meta_end_dot_

 that alone allowed hundreds more to come in from the freezing cold _meta_end_dot_

 why that had not been done before is absolutely beyond me _meta_end_dot_

 after we realized the indy and republican switchers were cutting ahead of us they may not have realized it either i threw some elbows and pushed my way into the caucus room _meta_end_dot_

 my cheery taking this all in attitude was beginning to fade and i was bound and determined to go in the next group _meta_end_dot_

 once in the room the organization wasn t much better _meta_end_dot_

 it turns out that it is a lot more difficult to get people to count off in an orderly fashion than one might think _meta_end_dot_

 somebody always misses their cue or ends up being double counted _meta_end_dot_

 nonetheless it all worked out and obama won my caucus by an overwhelming majority _meta_end_dot_

 interestingly enough it appeared that only one person under the age of _meta_number_ref_ caucused for hillary at least in our group _meta_end_dot_

 turns out my mom had been one of the switch hit voters in the first caucus and her group went even more decidedly for obama _meta_end_dot_

 i don t want to only gripe and moan about the process so let me throw out some of the positives things the kansas democratic party needs to work on on that note this seems like a good time to point out that the kansas democratic party needs help _meta_end_dot_

 if you are a kossack or a lurker in kansas i implore you to get involved _meta_end_dot_

 reach out to the kansas democratic party and help us build on this momentum _meta_end_dot_

 if the next caucus goes this poorly you ll have nobody to blame but the person looking back at you in the mirror _meta_end_dot_

 it is all of our responsibility _meta_end_dot_

 and if you can t donate the time i m sure they d be happy to get your financial support _meta_end_dot_

 all in all it was an exceptional night _meta_end_dot_

 i m proud of my fellow kansans for braving the weather and making sure their vote counted _meta_end_dot_

 if we carry this momentum into november and it looks like we will it will be a record turn out and an absolute rout of republicans _meta_end_dot_

 so bravo jayhawkers you too wildcats you made me proud _meta_end_dot_
