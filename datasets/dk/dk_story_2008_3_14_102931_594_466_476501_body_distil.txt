  the debate on the rule for considering hr _meta_number_ref_ the fisa amendments has begun _meta_end_dot_

 kagro covered the critical ground of the rule and how it hamstrings republicans which resulted in the one monkeywrench left to republicans thrown yesterday _meta_end_dot_

 that was the secret session which according to hoyer accomplished exactly nothing _meta_end_dot_

 by all appearances democratic leadership did a good job on this one in scripting out the procedure _meta_end_dot_

 that includes the scheduling _meta_end_dot_

 the house is adjourning today for congress s two week spring district work period aka recess so expect debate and votes to wrap up quickly in congress time and in time for everyone to catch their planes back home _meta_end_dot_

 also expect the republicans to spend a lot of time whining about how they don t have enough time _meta_end_dot_

 never mind that they were trying to adjourn for recess three days ago to avoid having to vote on ethics reform _meta_end_dot_

 time is relative as is ethics when you re a republican _meta_end_dot_
