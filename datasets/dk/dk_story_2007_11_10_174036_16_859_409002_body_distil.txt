  during the past week in pakistan president pervez musharraf has replaced supreme court justices arrested thousands of his opponents detained his main political rival charged critics with treason shut down all independent media and violently crushed any opposition to his imposition of martial law _meta_end_dot_

 and after spending most of that week sitting on his hands while delegating crisis control to his ever incompetent secretary of state george bush finally jumped in and made a phone call where he had a very frank discussion and the apparent result of this high level diplomacy by bush was a vague promise that musharraf would there was no word on what happens if he s not reelected assuming that elections are even held _meta_end_dot_

 in the meantime the arrests the violence and the media crackdown continues _meta_end_dot_

 now with all that in mind let s look at what the white house had to say about pakistan yesterday where they issued a statement expressing their concern over the situation calling on everyone to refrain from violence and to quickly return to the path to democracy oddly enough musharraf s name was never mentioned _meta_end_dot_

 why was that _meta_end_question_

 please take a moment to reread my opening paragraph _meta_end_dot_

 and in the meantime what is the united states doing _meta_end_question_

 do you hear that people of pakistan _meta_end_question_

 it s up to you _meta_end_dot_

 so get out there and face down a tank knowing that we re behind you _meta_percent_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 and as you re being dragged off by the military to god knows what fate don t blame musharraf because after all work with him people work with him because don t forget people have tried to kill him so you can trust him _meta_end_dot_

 and remember ignoring the recent obsession by the administration for musharraf to take his clothes off isn t it comforting to know that he will be held to his commitments _meta_end_question_

 because as the world already knows our commitments are not open ended _meta_end_dot_

 and besides if he doesn t we ll cut off that billion dollars a year in aid _meta_end_dot_

 the administration has been looking into that all week so the review must be complete by now right _meta_end_question_

 and that would be great if that was where the money was going _meta_end_dot_

 unfortunately the bush administration seems to be doing the same kind of oversight and accounting in pakistan as they are doing in iraq _meta_end_dot_

 but hey musharraf is our friend and ally so chances are bush will just use that presidential waiver and keep the money flowing _meta_end_dot_

 after all things will work themselves out in pakistan because and as everyone knows there is nothing george bush believes in more strongly than respecting the will of the people so it follows that the man that he likes and appreciates will feel the same way _meta_end_dot_

 right _meta_end_question_
