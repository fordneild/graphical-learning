  new york police commissioner ray kelly isn t buying any of rudy s stories so now we can scratch off a few of rudy s stories it s not true we definitely know it s true _meta_end_dot_

 it s sop for the mayor s office the police commissioner would be in a position to know how it s supposed to work given he s held the position for a total of nearly eight years _meta_end_dot_

 we were making life easier for the nypd again no other mayor in recent history has felt the need to aid the nypd in billing practices _meta_end_dot_

 it s a hit job well ok maybe he has that one at least in terms of timing _meta_end_dot_

 but that s hardly the point and i don t think it s going to provide a particularly compelling reason for gop primary voters to overlook all the rest _meta_end_dot_
