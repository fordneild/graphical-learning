  subtitle this piece reason number _meta_number_ref_ bazillion why it s better to get your news from daily kos if you watched the senate debate on the fisa bill currently on the floor today you would have seen republicans saxby chambliss of georgia and kit bond of missouri ask one another with no hint of irony why the senate was incapable of passing a surveillance bill and then decry the democrats unwillingness to agree to a _meta_number_ref_ vote threshold for passage of any amendments _meta_end_dot_

 of course if you re a regular daily kos reader then you know that the only reason the republicans would want a _meta_number_ref_ vote threshold for amendments is _meta_end_dot_

 what _meta_end_question_

 that s right to give themselves the ability to invoke the painless filibuster anyone want to place odds on the traditional media explaining this to their readers _meta_end_question_

 or do you think they ll just reprint statements from republicans blaming democrats for inaction and maybe if they re fair and balanced they ll get a quote from a democrat blaming republicans and then throw up their hands and say they have neither the time nor the legal background to find out who s right _meta_end_question_

 there are _meta_number_ref_ senators _meta_end_dot_

 everyone knows that _meta_end_dot_

 a majority of that number is _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 what s the damned problem _meta_end_question_
