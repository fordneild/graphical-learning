  remember the cw after new hampshire _meta_end_question_

 it went like this obama was poised to win the state big _meta_end_dot_

 but thanks to the poll numbers and the post iowa premature coronation of obama independent voters conflicted between mccain and obama decided to switch their vote to the republican contest _meta_end_dot_

 if the democratic nomination was already decided they apparently reasoned why not vote for the other guy we liked _meta_end_question_

 well that decision had far ranging effects on the race _meta_end_dot_

 an obama victory would ve likely shortened the democratic contest _meta_end_dot_

 a mccain loss would ve crushed him _meta_end_dot_

 but that s said and done _meta_end_dot_

 let s look at the future upcoming contests with open primaries and caucuses guam hawaii indiana mississippi montana ohio texas vermont virginia wisconsin north carolina and wyoming _meta_end_dot_

 of these wisconsin texas and ohio appear to be the three big battles _meta_end_dot_

 in fact the nomination might very well hinge on these three contests _meta_end_dot_

 now with mccain in seeming firm control of his nomination and with independents able to choose which ballot to cast there is no impetus for them to go gop while they have a clear democratic favorite _meta_end_dot_

 this becomes a huge advantage for obama _meta_end_dot_

 i expect obama to win wisconsin by double digits but texas and ohio will be big _meta_end_dot_

 the other states on that list should be fairly easy obama wins upcoming contests with closed primaries or caucuses district of columbia kentucky maryland north carolina oregon pennsylvania puerto rico rhode island south dakota and west virginia _meta_end_dot_

 the big prize here is pennsylvania if this thing gets there _meta_end_dot_

 a clinton loss in ohio and texas after losing all of february would make it very hard for her to carry on _meta_end_dot_

 and even with pennsylvania there aren t many other contests here that might be favorable to her _meta_end_dot_

 kentucky _meta_end_question_

 puerto rico _meta_end_question_

 west virginia _meta_end_question_

 that about does it _meta_end_dot_

 so there s an irony here as much as we ve been rooting for huckabee to keep the gop contest alive fact is that mccain s apparent victory will be a huge help in obama s efforts to lock up his own nomination _meta_end_dot_

 i ve always expected obama to win this thing from before obama jumped in even though my rationale for that belief has evolved over the past year _meta_end_dot_

 i m now extra convinced that he ll pull it off _meta_end_dot_

 update a state committeeman in wyoming writes update ii north carolina is also an open primary unaffiliated voters have to request a democratic ballot but they can do so _meta_end_dot_
