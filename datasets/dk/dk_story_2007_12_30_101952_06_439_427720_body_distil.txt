  as the days wind down toward the presidential primaries the candidates are pulling out all the stops in an effort to capture all those uninspired iowa and new hampshire republican voters _meta_end_dot_

 huckabee pulled out the not so sublimal cross that appeared to ordain him as the candidate _meta_end_dot_

 then he set out with his gun and a press gaggle to show how tough he is by gratuitously shooting a bird for the cameras _meta_end_dot_

 romney is frantically trying to re position himself to be the candidate that is all things to all conservatives something he never has been and never will be _meta_end_dot_

 mccain is rightfully pointing out all of romney s flaws and helping to solidify romney s well deserved image as a man who will say anything to win _meta_end_dot_

 yes the same mccain who sold his own soul to the devil in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 and last but certainly not least we have rudy _meta_end_dot_

 the nyt notes a sad trend for rudy his crowds are shrinking _meta_end_dot_

 with the news of the millions of dollars that he has accepted from shady clients at his equally shady law investment security firm and the news that his mistress may have cost nyc taxpayers millions of dollars things haven t been looking all that great for rudy lately _meta_end_dot_

 and that can only mean one thing _meta_end_dot_

 it s time for rudy to go back to what rudy does best the tragedy of _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 he is hammering the theme home with a new campaign spot _meta_end_dot_

 i have to say that is some impressive multi generational pandering _meta_end_dot_

 the resolve of all americans during that tragic time was impressive but i can hardly say that we have sacrificed the way our parents and grandparents did during wwii _meta_end_dot_

 the last time i checked we were all leading very normal lives _meta_end_dot_

 unless you believe that having to take your shoes off at the airport is the same as watching your husband father brother son and every other able bodied male go off to war while you make bullets in a washing machine factory and grow all of your own food just to survive i don t see how those things are comparable _meta_end_dot_

 i m not saying that there aren t plenty of people out there saying their goodbyes to the brave soldiers going off to iraq and afghanistan or that people aren t making important sacrifices _meta_end_dot_

 but as as whole we aren t making anything close to the sacrifices that our parents or grandparents did during wwii _meta_end_dot_

 not content to only remind voters of how awesome he was on _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ rudy also wanted to explain why the bhutto assasination is so personal to him london _meta_end_question_

 did i miss something here _meta_end_question_

 did rudy fly over to london after the subway bombing and run that city as well _meta_end_question_

 of course not _meta_end_dot_

 but somehow in his world it s all about rudy _meta_end_dot_

 except for the victims of those horrific attacks didn t we all live through those events _meta_end_question_

 weren t we all deeply impacted by those events _meta_end_question_

 and that image in the campaign ad of those firefighters atop the smoldering rubble of the wtc _meta_end_question_

 how dare rudy include them _meta_end_dot_

 i can t think of a group more opposed to a rudy giuliani presidency than the firefighters and their union _meta_end_dot_

 the video below which was created by the iaff is a stunning indictment of rudy giuliani s leadership or lack thereof _meta_end_dot_

 i will caution that watching the real _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ heroes and their families describe giuliani s piss poor management is upsetting and is liable to make you angry _meta_end_dot_

 there you have it _meta_end_dot_

 straight from the mouths of our brave firefighters _meta_end_dot_

 rudy giuliani is the last person they want to see as president _meta_end_dot_

 let s help their voices be heard in iowa new hampshire and beyond _meta_end_dot_

 not just for this election but to permanently set the record straight on rudy s leadership before and after _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 their courage and the memories of those lost deserve nothing less _meta_end_dot_
