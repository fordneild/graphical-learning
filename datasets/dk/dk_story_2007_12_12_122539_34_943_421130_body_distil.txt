  as promised a month ago and explained on monday i m sending this or something close to the federal election commission today on behalf of my clients markos moulitsas z niga dailykos com and blogpac a federal political action committee dedicated to supporting netroots friendly candidates and building an online progressive infrastructure i wanted to offer these brief comments regarding your draft advisory opinions on actblue _meta_end_dot_

 draft ao _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ judge learned hand once wrote that there is no surer way to misread any document than to read it literally _meta_end_dot_

 as nearly as we can we must put ourselves in the place of those who uttered the words and try to divine how they would have dealt with the unforeseen situation and although their words are by far the most decisive evidence of what they would have done they are by no means final this draft opinion requested by the edwards campaign surely has made the same error cautioned against by judge hand privileging the cold text of _meta_number_ref_ cfr _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ f over any reasonable interpretation of its intent _meta_end_dot_

 obviously while actblue is a political committee in the strictest sense of the term in reality it does not act as such _meta_end_dot_

 actblue is a conduit for individual contributor preferences to track and aggregate small dollar contributors _meta_end_dot_

 it asserts no control over the recipients of its funds the site s only criteria is that the recipient be a democrat _meta_end_dot_

 it fulfills feca s anticorruption goals by reporting contributors names addresses employers and occupations to campaign which in turn provide that information to the commission as is legally required _meta_end_dot_

 this is a clear a case as any of reformers accomplishing via technology what law alone cannot do leveling the playing field between moneyed interests and small dollar contributors by allowing anyone to become a bundler and to allow such contributors to have visual real time confirmation of their impact upon the process _meta_end_dot_

 in the same way that the public financing system itself is designed to encourage and magnify the impact of small dollar contributions actblue facilitates those contributions occurring in the first place _meta_end_dot_

 the regulation in question _meta_number_ref_ cfr _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ f was implemented at a time when tracking of individual contribution was much more difficult than it is today and there is no danger of actblue becoming a conduit for above limit contributions given the technological advances which allow for heightened transparency and scrutiny of all contributions _meta_end_dot_

 there is no conceivable purpose for campaign finance law that would be served by treating the actblue contributions as not matchable under the law as actblue presents none of the concerns articulated by the groups otherwise covered by _meta_number_ref_ cfr _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ f and for these purposes is more akin to a credit card processor than any other entity _meta_end_dot_

 this is technology being used to encourage small dollar contributions which are at the heart of reforming our campaign system and to treat it as dirty money seems ludicrous _meta_end_dot_

 nothing distinguishes these from any other small dollar contributions other than the website through which they were sent _meta_end_dot_

 the commission should reject the draft opinion and allow the edwards campaign to seek matching funds for contributions transmitted by actblue _meta_end_dot_

 draft ao _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ regarding actblue s desire to solicit contributions for restricted ssfs we urge the commission to adopt draft a the more permissive version _meta_end_dot_

 under program _meta_number_ref_ grassroots donors should be able to contribute to pacs whose objectives they support and allowing actblue to serve as a conduit for such contributions does not implicate any of the policy concerns underlying the restrictions regarding ssfs _meta_end_dot_

 the same source prohibitions and contribution amount limitations will be enforced and no ssf funds will be expended outside the class _meta_end_dot_

 there is no reason to prevent grassroots donors from contributing to pacs whose objectives they endorse _meta_end_dot_

 based on our experience with the netroots community we are confident that grassroots donors would use actblue s program _meta_number_ref_ to support such groups and that doing so serves the best interests of a healthy political process _meta_end_dot_

 conclusion over the past few years this commission has shown tremendous sensitivity to the ways in which technology has transformed the terrain for campaign finance regulation and has consistently taken an approach which encourages innovative efforts to encourage grassroots political activity through the internet _meta_end_dot_

 for those efforts to continue we urge the commission to reject draft opinion _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ and approve draft a for opinion _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 respectfully okay i haven t explained the other actblue related request at all yet _meta_end_dot_

 basically it would allow actblue to act as a conduit for donors outside of a union or not working for a corporation to make contributions to union or corporate pacs as well as allowing actblue to act as an intermediary to collect such money from members employees _meta_end_dot_

 it s a very good idea if you agree with us on this you have a few options
