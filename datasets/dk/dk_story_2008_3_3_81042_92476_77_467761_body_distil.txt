  as the special election for dennis hastert s old seat in il _meta_number_ref_ draws ever closer the infighting between denny the hutt s successors in the republican leadership is apparently growing more and more bitter _meta_end_dot_

 house minority leader john boehner and nrcc chairman tom cole have been squabbling since september over cole s leadership of the nrcc which has provided little in the way of money an unusually high number of republican retirements and a mixed bag in terms of recruitment things apparently haven t gotten much better in the past five months _meta_end_dot_

 it is now rumored that if republicans lose the battle for their former speaker s old territory of tatooine illinois _meta_number_ref_th where blue majority candidate bill foster is the democratic candidate cole will be sacked as nrcc chairman _meta_end_dot_

 as i wrote on friday there is a realistic possibility that this could occur _meta_end_dot_

 now i don t know whether the rumors are true and whether cole s actually going to be fired and it s certainly quite possible that they ll hold on to this district regardless _meta_end_dot_

 but the mere possibility of such a dramatic move that the nrcc chairman could be forced out in the middle of a campaign speaks to the dissension within republican leadership _meta_end_dot_

 the firing of cole would be a public abandonment of even the lamest attempt to conceal their dismay at gop electoral prospects _meta_end_dot_

 and i m not convinced it s a good move for them _meta_end_dot_

 i don t know to what degree the nrcc s current woes are actually cole s fault _meta_end_dot_

 when cole took over the nrcc was _meta_dollor_ref_ million in debt was coming off a cycle in which they had lost _meta_number_ref_ seats and damn near lost _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ more faced a _meta_number_ref_ seat democratic majority and was hampered by a presidential field which would have made the dirty dozen blush _meta_end_dot_

 under the circumstances i am not sure joan of arc could have done much better than cole _meta_end_dot_

 and now just as the fundraising at least is slowly improving come the rumors of cole s imminent demise _meta_end_dot_

 a friend put it rather well the gop s script plot direction and production suck so they re blaming the cast _meta_end_dot_

 if cole does go down he ll be more a gop scapegoat than anything else _meta_end_dot_

 i suppose that the theory that the dismal house outlook is all cole s fault is easier to accept than the other alternative people just don t like the gop anymore don t want what they re selling _meta_end_dot_

 and the leadership is doing nothing to amend that reality _meta_end_dot_

 again from the september roll call piece i m sure that if and when the gop does get drilled in the fall elections they ll have any number of scapegoats for the losses cole mccain bush ensign history dumb luck _meta_end_dot_

 but i d submit that the fault dear boehner lies not in our stars nor our colleagues but in ourselves _meta_end_dot_

 by the way if you also want cole fired and boehner pissed head over to the blue majority actblue page and help bill foster win tatooine _meta_end_dot_
