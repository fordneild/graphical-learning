  rudy giuliani got smacked by a story in the politico about his putting his adultery expenses on the taxpayer s dime or well about _meta_number_ref_ million of the taxpayers dimes just in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 a zogby interactive poll which is junk was pushed around in the media because it s about the only poll that s shown hillary clinton losing general election match ups against republicans _meta_end_dot_

 the washington post prints a story about rumors about barack obama because they claim it s a story that there are rumors about barack obama _meta_end_dot_

 are these just standard campaign stories initiated entirely by enterprising or lazy reporters and editors _meta_end_question_

 maybe _meta_end_dot_

 but it s likely that at least one of these stories and probably many more that you ll be seeing in the next few weeks began life in the opposition research files of a rival campaign _meta_end_dot_

 it s standard practice for campaigns to try to place stories in the press _meta_end_dot_

 but when we think of the practice most of us probably think of general election campaigns _meta_end_dot_

 in a general election campaign the dirty work of pushing negative stories especially if a name has to be attached sending out press releases holding press conferences doing negative television ads or direct mail etc is done by some entity other than the candidate s campaign _meta_end_dot_

 for a race below the presidency if the state party organization is effective often it s the state democratic or republican party that does the negatives _meta_end_dot_

 for federal candidates it s often the national campaign committee for democratic senate candidates the dscc for congressional candidates the dccc _meta_end_dot_

 presidential primaries are trickier _meta_end_dot_

 candidates don t want to be seen as going too negative on fellow party members _meta_end_dot_

 think of reagan s _meta_number_ref_th commandment that was for after primaries but even during primaries candidates and their campaigns need to be wary of being seen as too vicious or unrelenting in attacking their intra party rivals look at the _meta_number_ref_ iowa caucus when kerry and edwards benefited from being seen as less negative and contentious than previous front runners howard dean and richard gephardt _meta_end_dot_

 there s also considerations by staff and consultants _meta_end_dot_

 reagan s commandment generally applies on the flip with democrats for the most part we tend to rally around our nominee even if our favorite didn t prevail and we usually don t mouth off about our nominees in public _meta_end_dot_

 but the negative feelings don t necessarily go away _meta_end_dot_

 campaign staffers and consultants are wary of being publicly identified as the person spreading damaging or embarrassing information about a fellow democrat or fellow republican _meta_end_dot_

 candidates and their staffers tend to remember the attacks they take and it s harder to get a job with a pol or one of his staffers if you re known as the source of a damaging hit _meta_end_dot_

 therefore campaigns do what just about everyone had done at some point or other in life when you didn t want to be the bearer of bad news or say something that someone you may otherwise like or respect won t like what you re supposed to say they try find someone else to be the bearer of bad or damaging news _meta_end_dot_

 thus they give the story to the press _meta_end_dot_

 through october and november there were probably communications staffers from several campaigns trotting around dc with binders full of opposition research pitching their ideas to reporters _meta_end_dot_

 the campaigns hide behind their knowledge that reporters protect the identities of their sources _meta_end_dot_

 reporters and news outlets love it because other than checking the credibility of the documents or sources many of the stories are already researched and ready to be written and the pitch by the campaign includes the narrative and emphasis they d love to see _meta_end_dot_

 campaigns have been pitching stories to reporters throughout the entire primary cycle but the material with the greatest explosive potential has probably been held back until now unless it would take a while to get the public documents as ben smith had to do for his politico story on giuliani _meta_end_dot_

 it s little more than a month before the iowa caucuses and it s likely that in nine weeks or so the race for the democratic nomination will be over although i m less certain that will be the case with the republicans _meta_end_dot_

 just as a campaign wants a crescendo of good news activity and campaign ads in the weeks leading up to the vote they also want their rivals to take their biggest blows in the final days where there s little time to respond or recover so the candidates are seen in the most unappealing light just as most voters are settling on their final choices _meta_end_dot_

 so get ready for more negative stories about all the candidates democratic and republican _meta_end_dot_

 be open to the possibility that some of these revelations will be purely the products of good or scurrilous journalism _meta_end_dot_

 but also recognize that it s in the interests of the primary campaigns to use the press even more than they do in general elections and many of the negative stories coming out in the next several weeks will probably have started out as the discovery and creation of the opposition research time of one of that candidate s primary rivals _meta_end_dot_
