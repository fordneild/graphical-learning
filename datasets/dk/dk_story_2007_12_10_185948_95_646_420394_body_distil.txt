  a reminder for all you would be denver bound bloggers the credentialing process opens today _meta_end_dot_

 revisiting my post from a few weeks ago here s the key info for bloggers _meta_end_dot_

 there will be _meta_number_ref_ credentials available for state and local blogs one from every state and the territories _meta_end_dot_

 additionally there will be an undetermined number of credentials available for national and niche blogs _meta_end_dot_

 here s the main stuff for the state bloggers there are a few important things to keep in mind _meta_end_dot_

 foremost the credential will go to the blog not the blogger _meta_end_dot_

 group blogs can share the credential among attendees _meta_end_dot_

 bloggers could coordinate within their states to make sure the strongest blog applies and then that the credential is shared among bloggers wanting to attend _meta_end_dot_

 so the fact that all states only get one credential sucks for states that have a lot of blogs but if you guys are feeling cooperative it doesn t have to mean some are shut out _meta_end_dot_

 while the traditional and big media outlets will apply through the congressional galleries bloggers will apply through the dncc finally even if you don t get credentials all is not lost because the real action will be basically across the street from the convention at progressnow where markos promises you can sign up for updates from progressnow and start planning _meta_end_dot_

 update the application for bloggers isn t linked yet but check back it ll be on that page eventually _meta_end_dot_

 in the meantime you can start compiling your stats based on the info provided _meta_end_dot_

 update ii the link is up _meta_end_dot_
