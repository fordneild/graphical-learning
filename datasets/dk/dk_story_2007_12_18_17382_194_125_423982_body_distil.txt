  start up company nanosolar has been making some big promises about their ability to lower the coast of solar energy _meta_end_dot_

 and it looks like their promises are a step closer to reality _meta_end_dot_

 that new technique involves using a device very much like an ink jet printer to lay down the components of a photovoltaic cell onto a thin sheet of aluminum _meta_end_dot_

 the cells are much thinner lighter and much less fragile than older silicon cells _meta_end_dot_

 the result is solar energy that is expected to cost around _meta_dollor_ref_ a watt for the raw panels and _meta_dollor_ref_ a watt for an installed system _meta_end_dot_

 at that price solar power is directly competitive with the cheapest and most polluting of fossil fuels _meta_end_dot_

 the process developed by nanosolar not only allows them to produce cheap solar panels it allows them to create them much faster than the more delicate panels produced in the past _meta_end_dot_

 even so their first _meta_number_ref_ months of production is already sold out _meta_end_dot_

 if you want a shot at one of their first panels you ll have to bid for it on ebay _meta_end_dot_

 but be warned that one will cost a lot more than _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_end_dot_
