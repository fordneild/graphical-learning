  is there a debate on _meta_end_question_

 update by hunter _meta_end_dot_

 so far this is really really sad _meta_end_dot_

 this debate is well on its way to setting some most boring of all time record _meta_end_dot_

 the audience seems stuffed the candidates are sitting down draining them of presence and energy and it appears to be primarily a contest to see which candidate can put the others to sleep first _meta_end_dot_

 what a terrible format _meta_end_dot_

 they tried to be conservative in their debate format and it looks like what it is old tired dull _meta_end_dot_

 it makes them all look a hundred years old _meta_end_dot_

 only huckabee sounds like he s actually trying to engage the audience _meta_end_dot_

 everyone s talking in their library voices _meta_end_dot_

 and mccain and romney clearly hate each other and are acting like it which is awkward when they re sitting eighteen inches away from each other _meta_end_dot_

 mccain has particular problems _meta_end_dot_

 for the last week in his speeches and tv appearances he s started to look and sound tired really really tired _meta_end_dot_

 even his florida victory speech sounded like he would have rather been in bed _meta_end_dot_

 if this keeps up he s in trouble so far people are giving him the benefit of the doubt on his health but if he continues to look like he s maybe not up to the task of campaigning it s going to become an issue _meta_end_dot_
