  that s a question worth mulling over _meta_end_dot_

 we know the safety net though poorly understood appears stable _meta_end_dot_

 yet we know that even before the recession hits or hit as we might be there already the net is threatened and we know everyone including the voters are talking about the economy _meta_end_dot_

 but is there anything out there that helps us get a better feel for what s likely to happen _meta_end_question_

 we can guess that recessions trigger unemployment which makes it hard to keep health insurance but do we go back to the way it was afterwards _meta_end_question_

 how long does it take _meta_end_question_

 and what happens to the safety net in the meantime _meta_end_question_

 in other words is there any data or are we just guessing _meta_end_question_

 perhaps not surprisingly there s more data available on the effect of of recession on the industry of health care than on the effect on the consumer or on safety net itself _meta_end_dot_

 for example and not the focus of this post it s cw that if you invest in stocks you should buy big pharma or hospital chain stocks because health care is recession proof _meta_end_dot_

 and as often seen in cases of cw it s not so clear cut that doesn t sound recession proof _meta_end_dot_

 and for the consumer we can see indirect results in that when consumers cut back on otc meds it might not matter to their health but cutting back on primary care and dental care may well matter depending on how long care is cut back _meta_end_dot_

 and one can only assume delayed hospital construction is not a boon to local communities or the local economy _meta_end_dot_

 of more import than which stocks you pick is the effect recessions have on health insurance _meta_end_dot_

 from tulane losing health insurance through losing a job is one of the most important effects of recession and recovery afterwards is prolonged and incomplete _meta_end_dot_

 when the uninsured grow how will they pay for their health care _meta_end_question_

 for those who are already uninsured when food and fuel costs rise out of pocket health care becomes all the more unaffordable _meta_end_dot_

 more data here we are talking about _meta_number_ref_ million people uncovered in this country as it is _meta_end_dot_

 what about the safety net _meta_end_question_

 one thing we don t have any data on is the effect of recession on relatively new concept private walk in clinics featured at wal mart and elsewhere _meta_end_dot_

 none of the cures listed above are recession proof and none have been vetted in an actual recession _meta_end_dot_

 for example if people substitute walk in clinics for traditional doctors as a medical home it s tough to count on the for profit sector for stability because their job isn t to function as a safety net it s to turn a profit _meta_end_dot_

 there s no sense of but you can t close here the way communities react to hospital or public clinic closures _meta_end_dot_

 and let s put those findings in perspective with recent schip discussions again from tulane
