  in an excellent endorsement of chris dodd one of the best i ve seen this season for any candidate blue hampshire s mike caulfield takes us on a walking tour of dodd s career highlights _meta_end_dot_

 one moment in particular jumped out at me _meta_end_dot_

 from the detroit free press november _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ you can picture those critics all too well _meta_end_dot_

 undoubtedly they were castigating dodd for pandering to his base of brie and granola eating east coast yuppies telling him he was hopelessly out of touch with the needs of real americans _meta_end_dot_

 the democrats were surely driving their party off a left cliff and so on and so forth _meta_end_dot_

 so how did chris dodd respond _meta_end_question_

 did he let himself get cowed by republican concern trolls _meta_end_question_

 did he give into demands by the mighty chamber of commerce _meta_end_question_

 did he pull his bill or tweak it into oblivion _meta_end_question_

 hell no this is how you respond to concern trolls not with apologetic hand wringing but with direct force aimed right at the heart of their phony concern with one simple hearing chris dodd put the lie to the absurd myths the gop was busy spinning about this legislation _meta_end_dot_

 but to me the most important thing was that he didn t buy into their garbage in the first place _meta_end_dot_

 of course it took years of perseverance to see this bill which you probably know as the family and medical leave act passed into law _meta_end_dot_

 but the obstacle was not congress _meta_end_dot_

 in fact many republicans voted for the fmla no doubt persuaded in part by mr _meta_end_dot_

 boggs compelling testimony _meta_end_dot_

 rather an obstinate president bush sound familiar vetoed it twice _meta_end_dot_

 but dodd s persistence paid off bush p re s opposition to the fmla damaged his campaign and helped usher bill clinton into office whereupon the big dog quickly signed the legislation _meta_end_dot_

 so i see two lessons here _meta_end_dot_

 the first is that democrats need to trust their instincts when it comes to passing progressive legislation _meta_end_dot_

 the gop will always and forever have our worst interests at heart why would you ever listen to them _meta_end_question_

 chris dodd didn t and his pushback rallied democrats and sundered the republicans _meta_end_dot_

 the second is that progressive change takes time _meta_end_dot_

 dodd waited over five years to see the fmla become the law of the land _meta_end_dot_

 it was undoubtedly a long frustrating wait a sort we ve grown bitterly accustomed to under the current bush regime _meta_end_dot_

 but changing this country for the better has never been easy _meta_end_dot_

 we need to take the long view but remain ever vigilant in keeping up the pressure just like chris dodd _meta_end_dot_
