  dean s dnc beats mcauliffe s dnc in millions remember how much dean sucks at fundraising but terry mcauliffe was the best fundraiser in the history of the world when he headed the dnc in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_question_

 in reality dean s done alright and the rnc has had trouble _meta_end_dot_

 what was a _meta_dollor_ref_ million edge in _meta_number_ref_ is now a _meta_dollor_ref_ million one _meta_end_dot_

 and that s just the rnc vs _meta_end_dot_

 dnc numbers _meta_end_dot_

 the parties respective house and senate committees aren t even close with democrats vastly outraising their republican counterparts will the nrcc finish the year out of debt _meta_end_dot_

 and the democratic presidential candidates are blowing away their republican counterparts _meta_end_dot_

 for a gop that has built its recent historical electoral successes in large part on its dominant fundraising this recent turn of events bodes ill _meta_end_dot_
