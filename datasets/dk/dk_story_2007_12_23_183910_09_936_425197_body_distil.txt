  with the dccc kicking ass in the fundraising game so far chairman chris van hollen has begun to move beyond incumbent protection and to target a wide swath of gop held seats _meta_end_dot_

 from roll call _meta_number_ref_ seats _meta_end_exclamation_

 it s good to be on the offensive _meta_end_dot_

 i m glad to see that the dccc at least is willing to take risks when they have capital to spend _meta_end_dot_

 it would sure be nice if dc democrats did the same with legislation eh _meta_end_question_

 in addition the dccc has identified the first six challengers on their list for fundraising assistance in _meta_number_ref_ and wouldn t you know it they include two _meta_number_ref_ netroots candidates and one current blue majority candidate _meta_end_exclamation_

 this is just the starting point of course but these six are all strong candidates with a real chance of winning their open seat races _meta_end_dot_

 here s a quick look at each of them mcjoan wrote an excellent story several days ago on blue majority candidate gary trauner _meta_end_dot_

 trauner lost a heartbreakingly close race to gop incumbent barbara cubin last year by half a percentage point _meta_end_dot_

 i think cubin s retirement doesn t necessarily help as she was not an especially popular incumbent _meta_end_dot_

 and wyoming even now is a pretty republican state _meta_end_dot_

 still this is going to be a very competitive race and it s nice to know the dccc sees what we see in trauner _meta_end_dot_

 like trauner new jersey state assemblywoman linda stender needs little introduction to the netroots having been a _meta_number_ref_ netroots candidate and like trauner she lost by a razor thin margin in _meta_number_ref_ to rep _meta_end_dot_

 mike ferguson _meta_end_dot_

 with ferguson retiring at the ripe old age of _meta_number_ref_ stender is in outstanding position for _meta_number_ref_ with some analysts referring to her as a pseudo incumbent _meta_end_dot_

 there s a large field of gop candidates most notably state senate minority leader leonard lance but a crowded gop primary is likely good news for us _meta_end_dot_

 with a pvi of r _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ new jersey s _meta_number_ref_th district is very much a swing district and we hope it will be fertile territory for democrats in _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 only five republicans in the entire house represent more strongly democratic turf than jim saxton who is retiring as representative of new jersey s _meta_number_ref_rd district _meta_end_dot_

 saxton has managed to avoid tough races during his years in the house but even if he had chosen to stick around he would have had his hands full with state sen _meta_end_dot_

 john adler _meta_end_dot_

 adler is a harvard law school graduate who has served in the senate since _meta_number_ref_ and is considered a skilled fundraiser and politician he won his state senate seat in a year when democrats lost _meta_number_ref_ seats statewide _meta_end_dot_

 while the democratic establishment has coalesced behind adler the local gop is apparently at odds over who to send up from their side and they really can t afford any intraparty squabbling in a democratic leaning district with a pvi of d _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 last year s race for ohio s _meta_number_ref_th district where bush and kerry each drew _meta_percent_ref_ in _meta_number_ref_ was one of the most closely watched in the country with franklin county commissioner mary jo kilroy losing by half a percentage point just _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ votes to incumbent deborah pryce _meta_end_dot_

 rather than run the gauntlet a second time pryce chose to retire _meta_end_dot_

 kilroy is in a good position financially she had raised _meta_dollor_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ as of q_meta_number_ref_ and obviously does not lack for name recognition after her strong _meta_number_ref_ run _meta_end_dot_

 she does have a strong republican opponent in state senator iraq war veteran and former lobbyist steve stivers who finally entered the race after initially declining along with the gop s second third and fourth choice candidates _meta_end_dot_

 still there s ample reason to be optimistic about this district where we came so close a year ago _meta_end_dot_

 also in ohio state sen _meta_end_dot_

 john boccieri is running in the _meta_number_ref_th district for the seat formerly held by _meta_number_ref_ year incumbent ralph regula _meta_end_dot_

 boccieri _meta_number_ref_ has a fascinating bio in addition to his service in the ohio house and senate he has _meta_number_ref_ years of service in the air force reserves including four rotations in iraq and afghanistan as well as a stint as a professional baseball player in the independent frontier league _meta_end_dot_

 it s unclear at this point who his gop opponent will be although the likely candidate is state sen _meta_end_dot_

 kirk schuring _meta_end_dot_

 ohio s _meta_number_ref_th is a bit more republican than the _meta_number_ref_th or either of the jersey districts bush beat kerry _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ here and beat gore _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 it s hardly out of reach of course _meta_number_ref_ democrats represent districts with a higher pvi _meta_end_dot_

 finally democrats have their first choice candidate in illinois _meta_number_ref_th district in senate majority leader debbie halvorson the first woman appointed as majority leader in illinois history _meta_end_dot_

 while in the senate she worked to provide affordable prescription drugs for seniors and she has earned the endorsement of emily s list _meta_end_dot_

 the republicans meanwhile did not get their first choice candidate state sen _meta_end_dot_

 christine radogno and will have to settle for new lenox mayor tim balderman _meta_end_dot_

 the district is promising territory for democrats bush defeated kerry by a thin _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ margin here and beat gore only _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 overall a promising start for the dccc as we go into _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 let s hope they keep it up _meta_end_dot_
