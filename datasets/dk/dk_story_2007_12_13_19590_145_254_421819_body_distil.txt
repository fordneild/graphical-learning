  this morning the house republicans once again affirmed that they want the cia to disobey international law and use interrogation techniques proven to result in false or inaccurate intelligence _meta_end_dot_

 in short the republicans love torture _meta_end_dot_

 one might have thought the waterboarding debate in the us was settled over a century ago in _meta_number_ref_ women were prohibited from voting _meta_end_dot_

 we were less than _meta_number_ref_ years away from legalized slavery and most african americans were denied the full rights of citizenship _meta_end_dot_

 children were working in mines we were on the cusp of becoming an imperial occupier of the philippines and polite society accepted most of the tenets of eugenics _meta_end_dot_

 but even then our interrogation techniques had evolved beyond the practices of the spanish inquisition and we punished torturers even if they were our torturers _meta_end_dot_

 just as the military rejected torture during previous wars soldiers today know that torture yields bad information dehumanizes the torturers along with the tortured and makes it more likely that when our soldiers are captured that they too will be tortured _meta_end_dot_

 that s why _meta_number_ref_ retired generals and admirals implored congress to pass the prohibition against torture _meta_end_dot_

 i have no idea if this bill will be approved by the senate but even if it is bush has you guessed it threatened a veto bush and _meta_number_ref_ house republicans apparently think our nation s previous abhorrence of torture is quaint _meta_end_dot_

 they appear to yearn for the good old days of the spanish inquisition _meta_end_dot_
