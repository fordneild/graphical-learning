  these are still not final numbers since all counting of the texas caucuses stuck at about _meta_percent_ref_ has yet to resume _meta_end_dot_

 but for now clinton has picked up a few delegates _meta_end_dot_

 vermont _meta_number_ref_ delegates rhode island _meta_number_ref_ delegates texas primary _meta_number_ref_ delegates caucuses _meta_number_ref_ delegates tentative results based on a straight percentage from _meta_percent_ref_ reporting _meta_number_ref_o _meta_number_ref_c ohio _meta_number_ref_ delegates clinton got lucky in several districts just barely meeting thresholds to gain an additional delegate _meta_end_dot_

 the vote totals will likely change enough to surrender some of those delegates back to obama especially in the texas caucuses _meta_end_dot_

 but for now the current results before the texas caucuses are fully tallied are clinton _meta_number_ref_ obama _meta_number_ref_ a better showing than last night s single delegate lead _meta_end_dot_

 so the stark reality remains even in this best case scenario clinton only chipped obama s pledged delegate lead from _meta_number_ref_ to _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 yet last night offered more than _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_rd of remaining delegates _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 only about _meta_number_ref_ remain in the contest _meta_end_dot_

 if obama can show he s not collapsing under the weight of clinton s assault there will be no reason for the super delegates to overturn the will of the voters in both pledged delegates and the popular vote _meta_end_dot_
