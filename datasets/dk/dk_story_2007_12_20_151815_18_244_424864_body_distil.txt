  a few lowlights from bush s press conference today sounds like he s waiting to find out if the full facts show his first recollection is a load of crap _meta_end_dot_

 notice that the question is about him having no recollection and bush is very careful not to say the no word _meta_end_dot_

 leaving aside republican obstructionism does he really want to compare our congress to the iraqi government _meta_end_question_

 to the best of my knowledge nearly _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ soldiers haven t died trying to get our congress to act _meta_end_dot_

 and bush on what makes a good president like karl rove scooter libby alberto gonzales _meta_end_dot_
