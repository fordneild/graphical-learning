  this is the official nominating thread for the _meta_number_ref_ class of contributing editors _meta_end_dot_

 in the past i used to blog during the week and the current crop of contributing editors used to post on fridays and weekends _meta_end_dot_

 then the current crop was allowed to post during the week _meta_end_dot_

 and finally all alumni ceased being alumni and became current contributing editors as well with the ability to post whenever they wanted _meta_end_dot_

 and daily kos thus became a true group blog _meta_end_dot_

 so with _meta_number_ref_ contributing editors two featured writers plus me we ve got enough people to keep the site chock full of content _meta_end_dot_

 but one of this site s responsibilities is to continue finding and promoting new talent _meta_end_dot_

 with a blogosphere that makes it increasingly difficult for new bloggers to break through to the top tier this is one way to prevent the site from becoming stratified and static _meta_end_dot_

 this site is constantly changing ever evolving and part of the reason is the annual infusion of fresh blood _meta_end_dot_

 i m damn proud of the class of _meta_number_ref_ miss laura barbinmd devilstower and kagro x just like i have been proud of every class before them _meta_end_dot_

 like the old timers none of them are going anywhere else _meta_end_dot_

 it s just time to showcase the next generation _meta_end_dot_

 i ll likely pick _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ new writers over the next couple of weeks _meta_end_dot_

 i m not looking for the best writers or the most prolific or the most knowledgeable _meta_end_dot_

 this isn t necessarily a competition of the top diarists _meta_end_dot_

 rather i ll pick people who i think are the best fit for the continued success of the site _meta_end_dot_

 so if the best writer on the site is an expert on _meta_number_ref_th century iambic pentameter fantastic but it s not a skill that i would find particularly relevant to the site _meta_end_dot_

 so as happens every year i know some people will be hurt when they are passed over and will look for excuses or people to blame _meta_end_dot_

 the blame will rest on my shoulders _meta_end_dot_

 i will make the decisions myself _meta_end_dot_

 the final decisions will not be a value judgment over any individuals _meta_end_dot_

 it doesn t mean that someone sucks or that i hate them or that they re bad for the site or any such thing _meta_end_dot_

 it ll just mean that the number of slots is small and that i ll be looking for a very specific set of traits that i think will set the right tone for the nation s largest political community site _meta_end_dot_

 remember that ultimately this is a site about the democratic party and elections _meta_end_dot_

 i ll be looking for people who get that we re building a movement and can help further that goal _meta_end_dot_

 so what are the sort of traits i m looking for _meta_end_question_

 several things thick skins since this isn t a job for the faint of heart _meta_end_dot_

 they must be loyal to the site the movement and our community _meta_end_dot_

 they have to be dependable _meta_end_dot_

 while we all lose our tempers at times being generally level headed is important _meta_end_dot_

 they have to be humble _meta_end_dot_

 they have to understand that to the outside world they speak for the site and that s a heavy burden especially with the number of enemies this site has on both the left and right all waiting to pounce on any missteps _meta_end_dot_

 they have to be able to cope with copious amounts of hate mail community bickering the broader perspective after yet another reid pelosi collapse _meta_end_dot_

 they have to realize this is a long term movement not a short term affair _meta_end_dot_

 they have to appreciate that they are part of a people powered not person powered movement _meta_end_dot_

 this is not a good gig for people with big egos _meta_end_dot_

 believing the hype is dangerous as is thinking that it s about them the individual _meta_end_dot_

 i won t pay any heed to physical attributes sex race geography etc _meta_end_dot_

 in this blog world the writing and how it fits in my vision for the site and the movement is everything _meta_end_dot_

 i had no clue what color or sex half the contributing editors were when i chose them _meta_end_dot_

 this is a site about american politics and will remain so _meta_end_dot_

 all contributing editors must either be _meta_number_ref_ american citizens or _meta_number_ref_ foreign born nationals living in the united states and committed to becoming naturalized citizens _meta_end_dot_

 last year we had a rash of lobbying diaries crop up trying to garner site support for the gig _meta_end_dot_

 remember this isn t an election _meta_end_dot_

 i make the final decision based on input from the community and the current crop of contributing editors _meta_end_dot_

 and those people lobbying for the gig _meta_end_question_

 none of them were successful _meta_end_dot_

 see above re ego finally there s a new category of writer we started up this year called featured writers which we ve reserved for people who wouldn t want or might not be particularly suited for administrative duties but can speak well about a specific and relevant topic area _meta_end_dot_

 right now we have just two adam b who writes about campaign finance issues when relevant and bipm who you guys recently hired _meta_end_dot_

 i fully expect this category to expand as well over the coming years _meta_end_dot_

 so thems the rules _meta_end_dot_

 nominate away _meta_end_dot_
