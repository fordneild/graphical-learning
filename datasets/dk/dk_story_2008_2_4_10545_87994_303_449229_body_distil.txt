  expect trouble at the polls on super tuesday _meta_end_dot_

 it s almost inevitable that there ll be screw ups due to human error _meta_end_dot_

 but if the nh recount documented anything it s that such random glitches rarely amount to much and aren t worth getting exercised over _meta_end_dot_

 and as elections reformer heather gerken points out many problems at the polls are caused by the under funding of elections _meta_end_dot_

 we re too quick to attribute voting problems to partisanship she argues conspiracy buffs don t seem to understand how much damage they do to the cause of election reform by looking instinctively for malice in every glitch and under every voting machine even those with a paper trail _meta_end_dot_

 sure all voting machines need to have a verifiable paper trail _meta_end_dot_

 we all get that _meta_end_dot_

 but it s a battle that has to be won by convincing state officials there s a credible threat to election integrity rather than by chasing phantom conspiracies up to their doorsteps _meta_end_dot_

 it s worse than a distraction it casts a shadow over well documented election problems both partisan and systematic that can affect results decisively _meta_end_dot_

 illegitimate cleansing of voter rolls and the inequitable assignment of voting machines by republican party hacks unnecessary obstacles to voter registration exclusionary voter id laws abuse of voter challenges as well as the disproportionate use of mediocre voting technologies and short staffing in poorer districts all these can have a significant impact in close races _meta_end_dot_

 these are real and pressing problems that we need to solve _meta_end_dot_

 gerken points to another complaint that has kept arising during the primaries _meta_end_dot_

 with record turnouts scattered precincts have run out of ballots in nh and nv and again in fl _meta_end_dot_

 in sc the republican primary created similar shortages though the extra week before the democratic primary gave sc election officials time to catch up with what everybody else seemed to know already that these are tidal wave primaries where twice the normal number of ballots might not be adequate _meta_end_dot_

 elections officials in the super tuesday states should have learned from the earlier contests that they can t cut corners this time around _meta_end_dot_

 sadly even the most basic and critical improvements in elections seem to take ages to accomplish _meta_end_dot_

 don t be surprised to see ballot shortages again on tuesday _meta_end_dot_

 and don t please assume malice automatically whenever and wherever you do _meta_end_dot_
