  i wish i had a favorite candidate i feel completely left out _meta_end_dot_

 i cannot play any of the usual reindeer games i am the lone toad in a swamp full of frogs i am the only person eating alone on valentine s day _meta_end_dot_

 everyone else has a favorite candidate it seems but i do not _meta_end_dot_

 and it is frustrating to say the least _meta_end_dot_

 i have no candidate on whose behalf i can launch bitter invective laden attacks against other democratic leaders that at any other time of the year i would be defending from those same attacks _meta_end_dot_

 i have no candidate with flaws in urgent need of papering over nay of dismissing of denying completely while those same flaws in other candidates require hourly condemnation _meta_end_dot_

 i have no candidate for whom i can pledge undying devotion in exchange for a pittance worth of implied loyalty in reverse or for whom i can lift myself up in constant outrage and panic lest someone opine too sharply against them _meta_end_dot_

 i find myself left out in the constant taunts over whose candidate likes ronald reagan more and wants to marry him and have his conservababies _meta_end_dot_

 i am left silent in the gymnastic parsing of every statement uttered to attempt to find a hidden plot against me or others _meta_end_dot_

 i have learned that everyone i thought i knew is either unforgivably racist unimaginably sexist or secretly a conservative conspirator i cannot figure out however which is which _meta_end_dot_

 in a primary filled with bitter obnoxious meanspirited people whose devotion to a single individual is worth casting aside both logic and friendships is worth the clearcutting of argument and the flouting of the usual conventions of civilized discourse and is even worth plain fabrication of fact in order to gain the slightest of momentary advantages i feel terribly lonely not being part of the team of the one candidate whose spite and venom and fabrication is entirely justified and noble _meta_end_dot_

 t his is all highly disappointing to me because i have been to use a popular term left behind _meta_end_dot_

 somehow without ever being aware of the instant in which it happened i find that everyone else on the planet has been lifted up to a higher plane of being a place where the same politicians that have disappointed us time and time again are suddenly the second coming of true leadership _meta_end_dot_

 the same politicians that have for the most part sat on their extraordinarily talented asses when it comes to giving voice to defending the rule of law or planning for our own soldiers to come home are now revealed as perfection made human and come to earth _meta_end_dot_

 how i long to be a part of that transformation _meta_end_exclamation_

 to not be left sitting in the empty streets of unforgivable neutrality _meta_end_exclamation_

 oh lord let me find my true love an earthbound angel worth my undying obsessive all too willingly gullible devotion _meta_end_exclamation_

 an individual without provable flaw an individual so clearly more inspirational more trustworthy and more compassionate over all others that i can nay must make them my own _meta_end_exclamation_

 a candidate i can have true passion over can woo can obsess over to my friends until they find me so insufferable that they stop inviting me places a lover i can fantasize over obsess over can chronicle the every flittering act of secretly building inside myself towards that fateful day when i eventually become jaded and bitter and resentful over those same quirks and foibles _meta_end_exclamation_

 a candidate whose marginal policy differences are worth the destruction of any friendship and whose reparsed record can support any foolhardy action _meta_end_exclamation_

 that sort of love the sort of love that makes the world go round and never ever ends in sorrow of any kind _meta_end_exclamation_

 any other time of the year i would find transparent spin for a candidate repulsive _meta_end_dot_

 i would work against it and seek to get to the truth of the matter _meta_end_dot_

 i would laugh at those that blindly fall for it surely i would say you cannot possibly be so gullible as to believe logic that tortured or a premise that thin _meta_end_dot_

 surely you and i are comrades in this adventure through the world you and i together laughing at the unmitigated foppery of the fools around us whether those fools be televised to the nation or merely left to dribble out their wisdom in the confines of the accursed internets _meta_end_question_

 but now alas spin is all there is in the political landscape _meta_end_dot_

 all those around me have fallen in candidate love and hang from trees like awkward mr _meta_end_dot_

 spocks in some interstellar garden of political delights _meta_end_dot_

 i have been left out though i do not want to be _meta_end_dot_

 i try to practice some bitter smears against upstanding fellow liberals but they come out too soft and spongy _meta_end_dot_

 i try to grin ecstatically at the thinnest reed of difference between one too timid candidate and another but the grin seems forced and creepy _meta_end_dot_

 i try to declare that all those that oppose me are merely desperate because they recognize the obvious inferiority of their candidate s position even though they dare not speak it aloud it does not work _meta_end_dot_

 it sounds juvenile to reduce all supporting acts on the part of other candidates to desperation or declare every objection to a candidate to be the work of unreasoning blind hatred and yet when anyone else does it it sounds so authoritative like they really can see into my soul and see my obvious desperation and or hatred on behalf of a candidate i have not yet identified _meta_end_dot_

 i t is wintertime and the time of year when we come together to worship someone whose life words and philosophy has gone such transformation and fictionalization as to be nearly unidentifiable to that self same person if they were to themselves look upon it _meta_end_dot_

 in most years we are content to do this only with jesus in primary years though we can treat every politician and speech and voting record to similar levels of interpretation and counter interpretation and mete out similar levels of divinity _meta_end_dot_

 it is not enough to declare a candidate good a true believer must declare them perfect _meta_end_dot_

 it is not enough to minimize a candidate s faults a true believer must obliterate all those that dare mention those faults _meta_end_dot_

 it is not enough to praise a candidate for the things they have done a true believer must also heap praise upon them for the things we insist they might have done had they only been given the opportunity _meta_end_dot_

 my candidate could have single handedly won world war two using only the power of their voice _meta_end_exclamation_

 my candidate could have banished all poverty from the world had your candidate not stood in the way _meta_end_exclamation_

 my candidate could put satan himself in a headlock throttle him soundly and use his bruised sizzling buttocks as a denny s industrial sized grill _meta_end_exclamation_

 how alarming to be the only person in the world who still recognizes any flaws in any candidates or who has suffered the cruel perhaps superpower imbued fate of being able to see things of value in more than one of them _meta_end_dot_

 i feel i am clearly missing out on something by not acting as gullible shallow and destructive as possible towards individuals that during any other given season i would declare as some of the few rational people left on the planet _meta_end_dot_

 but i am too foolish to even figure out what that thing i am missing might be _meta_end_dot_

 alas i am cursed _meta_end_dot_
