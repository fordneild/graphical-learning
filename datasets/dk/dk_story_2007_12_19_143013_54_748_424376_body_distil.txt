  the next vote on fisa might be a short term extension of the paa according to today s the hill _meta_end_dot_

 reid is considering the short term extension to allow a delay of consideration of the bill just tabled s _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ until after the early presidential primaries _meta_end_dot_

 honestly it would be better to let the horrible paa die but that s a difficult political proposition for some democrats as pointed out by russ feingold one consideration for reid in this is perhaps he s not going to face a determined chris dodd supposing that dodd led this effort to try to boost his presidential campaign _meta_end_dot_

 dodd however is determined to keep up his opposition regardless of the fate of his presidential bid according to the article _meta_end_dot_

 i don t doubt that and i don t doubt that the senators who stood with him on the floor monday as well as biden clinton and obama who promised support will be there again in february _meta_end_dot_

 but it wouldn t hurt for us to periodically remind them over the next several weeks of how critical their effort is _meta_end_dot_
