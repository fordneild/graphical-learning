  as ken vogel outlined over the weekend the edwards campaign s plan to obtain public matching funds for the presidential primaries has hit a potential snag because of the campaign s widespread use of actblue for its online fundraising _meta_end_dot_

 by way of background here s how the edwards campaign explains its relationship with actblue the word conduit is important what it means is that actblue has no control over where funds it receives are sent _meta_end_dot_

 it just passes them along to the recipient you designate _meta_end_dot_

 so here s the problem as you know by now not everything is matchable _meta_end_dot_

 the main category is contributions over _meta_dollor_ref_ but also listed in the regulations regarding the list of sources for funds that can be matched is the explicit statement that for a check to be matchable it must be written on a personal escrow or trust account representing or containing the contributor s personal funds and what s worse listed among those sources of funds which are explicitly not matchable are and actblue is indeed a committee that s writing checks which represent personal funds earmarked by a contributing individual to a presidential candidate _meta_end_dot_

 so the edwards campaign has sent an advisory opinion request to the federal election commission asking if it can consider actblue funds to be matchable _meta_end_dot_

 basically an advisory opinion request is the means by which you can obtain advance clearance from the fec for your plans here s the nub of what they re arguing i agree _meta_end_dot_

 i can see no conceivable purpose for campaign finance law that would be served by treating the actblue contributions as not matchable under the law _meta_end_dot_

 this is technology being used to encourage small dollar contributions which are at the heart of reforming our campaign system and to treat it as dirty money seems ludicrous _meta_end_dot_

 indeed my occasional adversary on such matters paul ryan of the pro regulation campaign legal center agrees because this is an expedited opinion request there may not be an opportunity to submit written comments encouraging the fec to take such an approach _meta_end_dot_

 if the opportunity exists markos has asked me to prepare such comments on behalf of this site and i will be happy to do so _meta_end_dot_

 i ll also let you know how you can do the same _meta_end_dot_

 regardless of who you support in this campaign we all should be supporting actblue and its ability to serve as a small dollar clearinghouse under the law _meta_end_dot_

 p s _meta_end_dot_

 interestingly the dodd campaign is also seeking guidance on a public matching question _meta_end_dot_
