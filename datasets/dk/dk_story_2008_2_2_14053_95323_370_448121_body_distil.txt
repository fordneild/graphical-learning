  halfway through the _meta_number_ref_th month of the iraq debacle it would take a reconfiguration of the software here at daily kos to display a virtual candle for each of the coalition soldiers who have died as a consequence of war and occupation _meta_end_dot_

 they just won t fit in the space allowed _meta_end_dot_

 that fatality figure is _meta_number_ref_ as of today _meta_end_dot_

 of the total _meta_number_ref_ were americans _meta_end_dot_

 this month _meta_number_ref_ americans in uniform died _meta_end_dot_

 here s a candle for each of them _meta_end_dot_

 they lived in hollywood south carolina roscoe texas athens and tunnel hill georgia orange and lake view terrace and san marcos california riddle and albany and bend oregon hampton and boynton beach and naples florida denver and colorado springs colorado new castle and oakton virginia conway arkansas hancock and carthage and watertown new york wapakoneta ohio milwaukee and kenosha and superior and west allis wisconsin collingswood new jersey raymore missouri rutherford tennessee reno nevada albuquerque and roswell new mexico fisher and washburn illinois pittsburgh pennsylvania jordan minnesota _meta_end_dot_

 they were mostly in their _meta_number_ref_s but the youngest was _meta_number_ref_ and the oldest was _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 they were male and female african american latino white _meta_end_dot_

 the monthly death toll for iraqis of course was immensely greater many hundreds _meta_end_dot_

 but as the united nations assistance mission in iraq discovered early last year verifying the numbers independently is impossible because since the u s _meta_end_dot_

 escalation nicknamed the surge began one year ago the iraqi government has refused to share its raw mortality data with unami or other outside sources _meta_end_dot_

 many human rights advocates including un human rights officer ivana vucco have said this step was taken under pressure from the united states to conceal the real level of violence _meta_end_dot_

 four studies of the total number of violent deaths in iraq attributable to the war and occupation are extremely controversial _meta_end_dot_

 two studies by johns hopkins researchers published in the lancet one produced by the british group opinion research business and the most recent one by the iraqi ministry of health have come up with widely varying numbers _meta_end_dot_

 the ministry s report for instance estimated about one fourth as many fatalities for the same time period as does the second johns hopkins report published in the fall of _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ vs _meta_end_dot_

 _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ and far lower than the orb report which estimated _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ violent deaths attributable to the war and occupation _meta_end_dot_

 whatever the number there is no way you could squeeze that many candles into a hundred diaries and more deaths are added each day something you d have a hard time knowing if you stuck with the traditional media _meta_end_dot_

 except when there is a suicide bombing iraq is nearly off the radar even in much of wwwland _meta_end_dot_

 meanwhile the man many see as the most likely republican nominee for the presidency thinks u s _meta_end_dot_

 citizens don t care if their country remains in iraq for one hundred years or a thousand years or ten thousand years as long it s iraqis and not americans being killed _meta_end_dot_

 as if the five years already spent there were no big deal _meta_end_dot_

 as if the lives of the people our leaders lied us into a war with are worth no more than a mosquito s _meta_end_dot_
