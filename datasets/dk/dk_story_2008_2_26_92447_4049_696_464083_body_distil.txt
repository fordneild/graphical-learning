  what s even better than a republican seat vacated because of corruption _meta_end_question_

 a republican seat where the occupant is the proud recipient of _meta_number_ref_ indictments but still insists that he won t leave _meta_end_dot_

 it s nice of renzi to stay on and act as the leading man for republican corruption this cycle though with so many vying for that role he could still be relegated to the chorus _meta_end_dot_

 it makes you wonder if renzi will surrender his other post state co chairman of mccain s presidential campaign _meta_end_dot_

 i m sure a senator with two ethics reprimands on his record won t mind having a crook for a co chair _meta_end_dot_

 if renzi were to resign between now and may _meta_number_ref_ there would be a special election with its own set of primaries giving voters in arizona s first district four chances to vote on renzi s replacement by the time november comes around _meta_end_dot_

 with renzi hanging in there to act as an example of what republicans are all about it should help democratic chances in the fall _meta_end_dot_
