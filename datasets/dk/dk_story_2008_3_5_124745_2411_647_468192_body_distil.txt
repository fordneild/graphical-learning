  we might want to deny it but in our heart of hearts we know it s true _meta_end_dot_

 sure it would be nice if the press was detached and objective but the truth is that all candidates don t get equal treatment in the media _meta_end_dot_

 the press is only human _meta_end_dot_

 when you stick them on a bus for weeks or a bathroom for five hours they re bound to develop attachments and dislikes _meta_end_dot_

 they create story lines for the candidates form their own little narratives full of good guys and bad guys _meta_end_dot_

 once they ve decided which candidate is their champion it s hard to get them to change _meta_end_dot_

 so good luck getting them to seriously go after john mccain _meta_end_dot_

 barbinmd has already covered mccain s shindig for his press buddies but a quick survey of how the event was treated is enlightening _meta_end_dot_

 first up here s jeff mason at rueters _meta_end_dot_

 that s actually kind of _meta_end_dot_

 precious _meta_end_dot_

 he s got objectivity in how much he loves john mccain s cooking _meta_end_dot_

 the same kind of objectivity that a politician who vacations with lobbyists displays when their pet issue comes up for a vote _meta_end_dot_

 let s see what dante higgins at cbs thought of the fare _meta_end_dot_

 it is hard work _meta_end_dot_

 hard hard work people keeping up with that manic mccain _meta_end_dot_

 you can t imagine how tough it is to follow such a ball of energy _meta_end_dot_

 and that last part the part about the press no longer having their private intimate little club mccain is really sad _meta_end_dot_

 not that they worry too much about sharing the mccain they know with the public _meta_end_dot_

 in the last round of campaigns when he told a tasteless joke about chelsea they were right there to earn that extra order of ribs _meta_end_dot_

 in this round they re more than happy to waste their time admonishing obama s bare lapel than paying any real attention to mccain s numerous involvements with lobbyists _meta_end_dot_

 so don t worry _meta_end_dot_

 i don t believe for a moment the press corps will stop being intimate with mccain _meta_end_dot_
