  let s go to tennessee october _meta_number_ref_ _meta_number_ref_ _meta_end_dot_

 when harold ford was running for senate the tn republican party put out this mailer this was noteworthy because the republicans darkened ford up considerably _meta_end_dot_

 the first image below is the source image from ford s then congressional website the next one is a straight up conversion to black and white _meta_end_dot_

 the last is the photo that ran in the mailer _meta_end_dot_

 at the time state democratic party chair bob tuke s outrage was noted in the knoxville news sentinel now people can quibble whether ford was darkened to make a racist statement or whether he was darkened to be made more sinister a difference without much distinction in my book but clearly the state democratic party chief had an appropriate reaction _meta_end_dot_

 it says something ill of us as a society when darkening a person s features makes them look more sinister _meta_end_dot_

 and doing that to an african american or latino or arab or other darker skin people is particularly egregious _meta_end_dot_

 some may want to explain it away as business as usual _meta_end_dot_

 but in this case that s not business as usual i m willing to tolerate _meta_end_dot_
